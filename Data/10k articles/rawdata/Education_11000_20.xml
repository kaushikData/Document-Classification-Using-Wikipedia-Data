The [[United Nations University|UNU]] '''Akino Memorial Research Fellowship''' is awarded for studies in the fields of [[human security]] and sustainable development in [[Central Asia]] and neighboring regions. It was instituted in 1999&lt;ref name="YK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue7_2.htm |title=UNU selects 2001 Akino Memorial research fellows |publisher=UNU Update |author= |accessdate=2009-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608235824/http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue7_2.htm |archivedate=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in memory of [[Dr.]] [[Yutaka Akino]], who was killed in July 1998 while on active service as a Civil Affairs Officer of the United Nations Mission of Observers in [[Tajikistan]] (UNMOT).&lt;ref name="AMR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/akino/announce.html |title=UNU Akino Memorial Research Fellowships |publisher=United Nations University |author= |accessdate=2009-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521063750/http://www.unu.edu/akino/announce.html |archivedate=2008-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fellowship links the UNU-Akino Memorial Research Project on Central Asia and neighboring regions where Akino had an academic and professional interest.&lt;ref name="AMR" /&gt; On an exceptional basis, fellowships can be awarded to nationals of Central Asian countries who study at a Japanese university.&lt;ref name="AMR" /&gt;

In 1999 the UNU received a [[Japanese yen|¥]]100 million donation from the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] in memory of Akino.&lt;ref name="YK"/&gt; Half of the donation is being used to fund the five-year Akino Memorial Research Project.&lt;ref name="YK"/&gt;

'''Al Raja School''', commonly abbreviated  as "ARS", is a private, [[bilingual]], [[coeducation]]al, multicultural non-profit [[K-12]] institution in the capital city [[Manama]], in the [[Kingdom of Bahrain]]. Founded in 1899 by Amy Zwemer as the country's first [[Western culture|Western]] school, it was formerly known as the Acorn School and then as the American Mission School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History |url=http://www.alrajabahrain.org/our-school.html |publisher=Al Raja School |accessdate=7 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915090429/http://www.alrajabahrain.org/our-school.html |archivedate=15 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in near proximity of the heart of the capital, Al Raja School lies adjacent to the [[American Mission Hospital]], Bahrain's financial and diplomatic area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directions to Al Raja School |url=http://www.alrajabahrain.org/directions.html |publisher=Al Raja School |accessdate=7 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915090419/http://www.alrajabahrain.org/directions.html |archivedate=15 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1899, Maryam Ali saw a need.  There were a few students - her daughters and a few other girls from the neighborhood - who were eager and ready to learn.  Armed with only a few books and an enthusiasm that was second to none, Ms. Zwemer met with these seven girls on her back porch and taught writing and reading.  She called her school The Acorn School.  Connected with the American Mission Hospital, and the work directed by her husband, Samuel Zwemer, her little school began to grow.  In less than three years, there was a need for a school building to be built.

With donations from churches from the Reformed Church in America in the US, a church and school building was built.  Every day 10-15 students attended to learn reading, writing and arithmetic.  In the afternoons, trade crafts were taught by American staff and Bahraini members of the community.  The school continued to grow over the years, eventually becoming an all girls school.  In the 1930s, there was a demand to begin a formal boys section in the school. Eventually the school became known as the American Mission School, the name by which many in the community know it today, serving students from KG - Grade 9.  During that time it held classes at the church facilities, which themselves morphed and changed over the decades.

In 1994, the current campus was built, and the school moved to its current campus.  In the early 2000s, grades 10, 11, and 12 were added, and the first graduating class walked in 2008.  Most recently, the school has added the Advanced Placement curriculum for students, and has begun the accreditation process with AdvancEd.  The school continues to work towards building strong community through building strong students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s101156773361407229260!2s0x3e49af5a3d3d1f89:0x6098cdb5306748ff?hl=en-BH|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
The school offers the American Diploma and is accredited by [[AdvancED]], an American accreditation agency.  The Ministry of Education has also approved the high school diploma as equivalent to their Tawjihi{{clarify|date=May 2014}} Diploma. Students in grades 11 and 12 have the option of taking [[Advanced Placement]] courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alrajabahrain.org/advanced-placement.html|title=Advanced Placement|website=Al Raja School|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Architectural Association of [[Universiti Teknologi Malaysia]] ({{lang-ms| Persatuan Senibina Universiti Teknologi Malaysia}} or PSUTM), more commonly known as '''Architech''', is the official association for students of architecture in UTM. It was formed in the 70s during the Kuala Lumpur days, and one of the earliest students association to be registered under Office of Students' Affair (HEMA, previously HEP), and is acknowledged as one of the most active students association in UTM. It resides within the [[Department of Architecture, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia]], under the Faculty of Built Environment.

==Role==
The main role of Architech is to manage the welfare of the UTM architecture students, organize events of various forms for the benefits of its members, to become the voice of the students in the school, and ultimately to ensure the advancement of non-academic qualities amongst its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mat Yasir|first=Azari|title=Workbase Booklet 2011/12|year=2011|publisher=Department of Architecture, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia|location=Johor, Malaysia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo==
The Architech logo was a result of a design competition held by the association in 1992, initiated by the president at the time, Zulhisham and Che Wan Ahmad Faizal. At the time, the name Architech have not come into being, and the logo competition was actually for PSUTM. The prize advertised was RM200, however the participations were poor and uninspiring (less than 20 entries), hence no winner was picked. Instead, Che Wan Ahmad Faizal then approached Fauzee Nasir to design a logo worthy for the association.

Using Aldus Freehand 2.0. on a classic Mac, Fauzee designed the logo, incorporating the name Architech for the first time. This was the first instance of the name in use. The logo and the name Architech was accepted by the general population, and remains in use until now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nasir|first=Fauzee|title=Asal Usul Logo Architech|url=http://www.tanggam.com/v4/forum/index.php?topic=566.0|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description===
The logo utilizes simple and straightforward [[typography]], using [[Times New Roman]], beginning with a capital A and with italic type applied to the last four letters. The letters "Archi" will normally be black on white/light background, or white on black/dark background. The letters "tech" will normally be red, or gray in monochrome print.

===Rights and Ownership===
The Architech logo was designed and still owned by [[Fauzee Nasir]] until today. In a deal struck with the association, the association agreed not to pay the RM200 prize money to Fauzee Nasir as the design was not part of the competition. Hence, the designer retains ownership and rights to the logo. However, in a mutual agreement the designer gave right to use and reproduce the logo as long as it is not for commercial use. Any commercial use must have written permission from the designer.

==Student Composition==
Architech members consist of the entire population of architecture students in UTM, as students enrolled in the programme are automatically registered under it unless otherwise requested. Previously it also included students of landscape architecture until they formed their own students society in the late 1990s. When the diploma programme was shifted to UTM KL campus under the [[Razak School]], the diploma students formed their own society called ARCO, which was intended as a sister society to Architech. However, due to logistics problem, especially since both are now under two different schools, ARCO became an independent body, but maintained close relations with Architech.

===Sub-communities===
Below is the list of students batches and name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tanggam.com/v4/forum/index.php?board=40.0 List of Subcommunities in Tanggam&lt;/ref&gt; (Due to the various intake positions in the programme, it made more sense to list the batches according to their respective graduation year, instead of intake year).

==Publications==
===Architext===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Architext frontpage August1997.jpg|thumb|right|The front page of 'Architext' dated August 1997.]]  --&gt;Architext was initiated as a periodical newsletter for Architech. It started around 1997, led by Roshida Majid and advised by Dr. Mohd Tajuddin Mohd Rasdi. Copies of the first two issues were lost; #3 was the earliest remaining copy today. It was distributed free bilingually in Bahasa Malaysia and English, featured several articles relating to architectural studies, listed events and activities, as well as a cartoon sketch.

Architext was never resumed and was presumably forgotten, until recently some of its original members began discussing of bringing it back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Johnson|title=Architext|url=http://www.tanggam.com/v4/forum/index.php?topic=4168.0|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design Folio===
The Design Folio is a publication collecting selected students' thesis works from a particular year. It is published with the notion of showcasing works based on specific theme for each publication. Students works are then selected based on the theme, ideally spanning between three and five years of thesis works. However, in its two innumeration, the selection is limited within a group of students in a particular year.

The publication is intended for commercial publications. The editorial consists of entirely students from the thesis group, advised and consulted by the Thesis Coordinators. To date, there have been two successful publications: the first in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamaruddin]|first=[editor, Syahril Nizam|title=Alternative : a design folio 2005|year=2005|publisher=Skywriting studio|location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia|isbn=983-42507-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the second in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ariffin|first=consultant editor, Syed Ahmad Iskandar Syed|title="A" for architecture an alternative book : design thesis folio 2007|year=2008|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Press|location=Skudai, Johor Darul Ta'zim|isbn=978-983-52-0480-7|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was another manuscript managed to be completed in 2008, however due to funding limitations, it did not get published.

===Design Thesis Synopsis===

==Anthem==
The association have adopted a song written by one of the students in the late 80s, Zuhairi Harun. The song was titled 'Warisan', touching on the struggle of heritage and identity of architecture in Malaysia. The song have gone through a number of renditions, including quickening of tempo and change of melody, however the spirit of the song remains.

==Activities==
===Architectural Workshop===
The architectural workshop is an annual national gatherings of architectural students in Malaysia. It began in 1987 in UTM, using the format of a jamboree, organised by Persatuan Arkitek (Architech) in Kuala Lumpur. Concurrently during the workshop, the PAM-Education Liaison Meeting would also take place to take advantage of the gatherings of students from various schools in one location.

Architech was the pioneer of the architectural workshop, which exists until today. The last architectural workshop hosted by Architech was in June 2011 using the theme "Terang". It was the biggest architectural workshop ever hosted by Architech, involving over 24 schools of architecture from all over Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=400 penuntut 'terangi' Johor Bahru|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0622&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Johor&amp;pg=wj_01.htm|accessdate=13 August 2012|newspaper=Utusan Malaysia|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officiated by PAM Vice President Ar. Saifuddin Ahmad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Permintaan, tawaran tinggi punca arkitek 'lari'|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0615&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Kampus&amp;pg=ka_02.htm|accessdate=13 August 2012|newspaper=Utusan Malaysia|date=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the outcome of the module was street furnitures, which became a feature in Jalan Wong Ah Fook, Johor Bahru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arca perabot hiasi Jalan Wong Ah Fook |url=http://utusan.adamantsys.com/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0622&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Johor&amp;pg=wj_03.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130116043407/http://utusan.adamantsys.com/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0622&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Johor&amp;pg=wj_03.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 January 2013 |accessdate=13 August 2012 |newspaper=Utusan Malaysia |date=22 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 20 sculptures were displayed and used by the public for a period of several days.

At the moment, it is undecided on when the next hosting by Architech will be, but it is estimated around 2016.

It is a secure, access-controlled repository, built and hosted at the [[University of Canterbury]],&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; with the purpose of preserving a digital record of the earthquakes and the rebuild, and to facilitate future research.

Earthquake-related content is sourced by the UC CEISMIC programme office from researchers, community groups, and other organisations and individuals. Content is then organised, described and stored in online collections. Qualitative [[metadata]] such as geo-locations, dates, file sizes, tags and categories is added where possible by the programme office team.

The QuakeStudies archive includes large content collections such as [[Fairfax Media]], [[Environment Canterbury]], [[Gap Filler]], [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]], QuakeBox, urban regeneration projects and a digitised copy of The Pledge.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; It also holds content contributed by individuals and community groups, such as records of blog posts by members of the Christchurch Bloggers group and a variety of photographs and videos.

'''Columbia Business School''' ('''CBS''') is the [[business school]] of [[Columbia University|Columbia University in the City of New York]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Established in 1916, Columbia Business School is one of the oldest business schools in the world. It is one of six [[Ivy League business schools]], and has been referred to as among the most selective of top business schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessmajors.about.com/od/bschoolrankings/tp/TopSelectiveMBA.htm|title=Top 5 Most Selective Business Schools|publisher=About.com|accessdate=April 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[Image:CBS Logo 1950s.gif|thumb|100px|right|Logo introduced in the 1950s]] 
[[Image:CBS Logo 1990s.gif|thumb|100px|right|Logo introduced in the 1990s]]

The school was founded in 1916 with 11 full-time faculty members and an inaugural class of 61 students, including 8 women. Banking executive Emerson McMillin provided initial funding in 1916, while [[A. Barton Hepburn]], then president of [[Chase National Bank]], provided funding for the School's endowment in 1919. The School expanded rapidly, enrolling 420 students by 1920, and in 1924 added a PhD program to the existing BS and MS degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/about-us/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502220219/http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/about-us/history |archivedate=May 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmXOAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI|title=A History of the Graduate School of Business, Columbia University|first=Thurman William Van|last=Metre|date=July 21, 2018|publisher=Columbia University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Columbia Business School authorized the awarding of the [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree. Shortly thereafter, in the 1950s, the School adopted the [[Hermes]] emblem as its symbol, reflecting the entrepreneurial nature of the Greek god Hermes and his association with business, commerce and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/alumni/news/New-Visual-Identity |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212203915/http://www7.gsb.columbia.edu/alumni/news/New-Visual-Identity |archivedate=December 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, CBS admitted its last class of undergraduates. The school currently offers executive education programs that culminate in a Certificate in Business Excellence (CIBE) and full alumni status, and several degree programs for the MBA and PhD degrees. In addition to the full-time MBA, the school offers four Executive MBA programs: the NY-EMBA Friday/Saturday program, the EMBA-Global program (launched in 2001 in conjunction with the [[London Business School]]), the EMBA-Americas program launched in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.veritasprep.com/blog/2012/05/columbia-launches-new-emba-americas-program/ |title=Columbia Launches New EMBA-Americas Program |accessdate=2018-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the EMBA-Global Asia program (launched in 2009 in conjunction with the [[London Business School]] and the [[University of Hong Kong|University of Hong Kong Business School]]). Students in jointly run programs earn an MBA degree from each of the cooperating institutions.

On July 1, 2004, [[R. Glenn Hubbard]] became Columbia Business School's eleventh dean. Hubbard, the former chair of President Bush's [[Council of Economic Advisers]], has worked in the private, government and nonprofit sectors, and played a role in shaping national and international economic policy, including the deregulation policy leading up Wall Street bank failures in 2008. In Charles Ferguson's 2010 documentary, ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]'', when prompted, Hubbard strongly maintains that his political and financial connections to government and Wall Street firms do not create any potential academic conflict of interest. Hubbard has announced plans to step down as dean in June 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gee |first1=Kelsey |title=Columbia Business School Dean to Step Down |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/columbia-business-school-dean-to-step-down-1536880116 |accessdate=31 October 2018 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia Business School is primarily housed in Uris Hall, at the center of Columbia's [[Morningside Heights]] campus. An auxiliary space, Warren Hall, is situated on [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] and is shared with the [[Columbia Law School|law school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/06/11/bschool.html|title=Columbia University Announces Business School Plan to Move in First Phase of Proposed Expansion in Manhattanville|accessdate=December 30, 2007|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Urishall.JPEG|thumb|left|upright|Uris Hall, standing behind [[Clement Meadmore]]'s 1968 sculpture "The Curl"]]

In October 2010, Columbia Business School announced that alumnus [[Henry Kravis]], the billionaire co-founder of private-equity firm [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] (KKR &amp; Co.), pledged $100 million to fund expansion of Columbia Business School, the largest gift in its history. The donation will go toward construction of the business school’s new site in the [[Manhattanville]] section of New York City, where Columbia University is extending its campus. One of the school’s two new buildings will be named for Kravis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0520346620101005|title=KKR's Kravis pledges $100 mln to Columbia|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=October 10, 2010 | date=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The buildings will be designed by [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-12/columbia-business-school-picks-diller-scofidio-for-new-6-3-billion-campus.html | work=Bloomberg | first=James S. | last=Russell | title=Columbia Business School Picks Diller Scofidio for New Campus | date=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2012, [[Ronald Perelman]] also donated $100 million to the construction of the second business school building.

==MBA program==
The Columbia MBA Program is highly competitive with an admission rate of 16% for the 2017 entering class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/programs/mba/admissions/class-profile|title=MBA Class Profile|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student body is highly accomplished and diverse.  Students in the class that entered in 2009 come from 61 countries and speak more than 50 languages.&lt;ref name="Columbia Business School employment report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/business/career/employmentreport/2007/CBS_EmployReport2007.pdf|title=Columbia Business School 2007 Employment Report|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revised core curriculum, launched in the fall of 2008, represents about 40% of the degree requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/curriculum/corecurriculum|title=Columbia Business School MBA Core Curriculum|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313173924/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/curriculum/corecurriculum|archive-date=March 13, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of 2 full courses and 12 half-term courses including Corporate Finance, Financial Accounting, Managerial Statistics, Managerial Economics, Leadership, Operations Management, and Marketing Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/curriculum/corecurriculum|title=Columbia Business School MBA Program Core Curriculum|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313173924/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/curriculum/corecurriculum|archive-date=March 13, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the first year of the program is usually devoted to completing the requirements of the core curriculum, the second year provides students with the opportunity to choose from the more than 130 elective courses available at the School and supplement them with more than 4,000 graduate-level classes from the University's other graduate and professional schools.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/curriculum/electives|title=Columbia Business School MBA Program Electives|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular electives at Columbia Business School are the Economics of Strategic Behavior, Financial Statement Analysis and Earnings Quality, Launching New Ventures, Modern Political Economy, and the Seminar in Value Investing.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

Columbia Business School has a firm grade non-disclosure policy, stating that students refrain from disclosing specific class grades, [[Grade Point Average|GPAs]], or transcripts until they accept full-time, post graduation positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cbsgba.com/culture/grade-non-disclosure-gnd |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111212165436/http://cbsgba.com/culture/grade-non-disclosure-gnd |archive-date=December 12, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students enter Columbia's MBA program in two tracks.  The traditional fall term is approximately 550 students, while the January term "J-Term" is approximately 200 students.  Students entering in the fall are divided into eight clusters of approximately 65 students that take all first year core classes together. J-Term students are broken into three clusters.  The J-Term is aimed at students who want an accelerated 18-month program who usually plan to return to their previous job, are company sponsored, and will not pursue a summer internship because they take classes during the summer.

The recently launched ''Columbia CaseWorks'' program utilizes the faculty’s research and industry experience and brings that perspective into the classroom through the development of new cases and teaching materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/caseworks/about|title=About CaseWorks|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in orientation and continuing through core classes and electives, students are immersed in cases that use faculty research to address real-world business issues. Columbia CaseWorks challenges students to debate corporate decision making and to develop appropriate recommendations and solutions.  During their first year, students study and discuss an integrated case that focuses on a single company and is incorporated into several core courses.  This encourages students to think about a company holistically, analyzing it from the perspective of various disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/versatile |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906191822/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/versatile |archive-date=September 6, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the median starting base salary was $110,000, with a median $30,000 signing bonus and a median $20,000 of other guaranteed compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www7.gsb.columbia.edu/recruiters/employmentreport Columbia Business School Employment Report – 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419042029/http://www7.gsb.columbia.edu/recruiters/employmentreport |date=April 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, 90% of billionaires with MBAs who derived their fortunes from finance obtained their master's degree from one of three schools: [[Harvard Business School]], Columbia Business School, or [[The Wharton School]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/02/billionaire-clusters-harvard-skull-and-bones-goldman-business-billionaires-wealth.html Forbes: Billionaire Clusters]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Dual-degree programs===
Columbia Business School students can combine an MBA with one of ten other professional degrees.  In general, a dual degree requires one less year than it would take to complete the two degrees separately. Candidates must apply separately to Columbia Business School and the other degree program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dual Degrees {{!}} Programs|url=http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/programs/mba/academics/dual-degrees|website=Columbia Business School|publisher=Columbia University in the City of New York|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive MBA programs==
Columbia offers various executive MBA programs.

The Executive MBA (EMBA) Friday/Saturday Program is a 20-month graduate program designed for individuals that are looking to enhance their education without interrupting their careers. The EMBA program is taught on campus at Columbia University by full-time faculty. The first year of classes consists of the same core curriculum as the Full-Time MBA program. Executive education is the focus of the second year.  This Friday/Saturday program is targeted at individuals with approximately 10 years of work experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/emba/overview/|title=Columbia Business School EMBA Overview|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Executive MBA (EMBA) Saturday Program is a 24-month graduate degree program designed for individuals that are looking to enhance their education, but cannot take any time away from work.  This program is the same as the Friday/Saturday program, with the exception that classes only meet on Saturdays over a longer period of time.

In addition to the New York-based EMBA Program, Columbia offers three partner programs to meet the differing needs and geographical distribution of prospective students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/emba/overview/partner/|title=EMBA: Partner Programs|year=2008|accessdate=April 26, 2008|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506153953/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/emba/overview/partner|archive-date=May 6, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because students in the partner EMBA programs must satisfy the separate requirements of each school, they earn an MBA degree from each participating university. Likewise, they become alumni of each university and business school and may avail themselves of all programs and privileges afforded to alumni.

*The EMBA-Global Americas &amp; Europe program is a 20-month program administered in partnership with the [[London Business School]]. The program enrolls approximately 70 students from around the world per year. Courses are taught by the full-time faculty of both schools. During the first year, the core curriculum classes alternate monthly between the campuses of Columbia University and the London Business School. The core curriculum is similar to that offered in the regular EMBA programs offered separately by each school, but with a more transnational-business emphasis. Second year classes may be selected from the portfolio of EMBA classes offered at either or both partner schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.edu/emba-global/faqs.html |title=FAQs |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |publisher=[[London Business School]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218192454/http://www.london.edu/emba-global/faqs.html |archivedate=December 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The EMBA-Global Asia, run jointly with the [[London Business School]] and the [[University of Hong Kong]]. This 20-month program follows a curriculum similar to the EMBA-Global program. Classes are held in Hong Kong, London, New York, and Shanghai.

==MS Programs==
Columbia Business School offers three separate Master of Science degrees in Management Science &amp; Engineering, Financial Economics and Marketing. Admission to the programs is extremely competitive: in 2011, there were 543 applicants to the Financial Economics program and only 10 students were accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia Business School MS Financial Economics Candidaite Profile|url=http://www7.gsb.columbia.edu/ms/financialeconomics/admissions/profile|access-date=April 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428131920/http://www7.gsb.columbia.edu/ms/financialeconomics/admissions/profile|archive-date=April 28, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctoral Program==
The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is offered by the [[Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences|Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] and is administered by the Business School.  Admission is highly competitive with 894 applicants in 2010 for positions in an entering class of 18 students (2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/learnmore/statistics|title=Columbia Business School Doctoral Program Admissions Statistics|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[PhD in Management]] or Business is a common precursor to an academic career in business schools.

Throughout the program, students become familiar with research methods and the literature of their major fields through research projects and directed reading.&lt;ref name="gsb.columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/academics/overview|title=Columbia Business School Doctoral Program Overview|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctoral candidates begin the program mastering basic research tools by studying subjects such as economics, behavioral science and quantitative methods, in addition to completing course work and examinations in the major field of study. The completion of course work and qualifying examinations normally requires two to three years.

The research phase begins as early as the first year, when students serve as research assistants, and continues throughout their time at the School.&lt;ref name="gsb.columbia.edu"/&gt; Students gradually become more involved in the design and execution of research and, by the end of the second year, have typically produced at least one paper suitable for publication, often as coauthor with a faculty member. The later years of the program are dedicated to original research and the creation of the dissertation.

Recent Columbia Ph.D. program graduates have placed in the following institutions: Harvard Business School, Wharton School, 
London Business School, Kellogg School of Management, Cornell University, University of Notre Dame, Stern School of Business, University of Minnesota, Fordham University, Polytechnic University, Baruch College, University of Washington, EWHA Womans University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Toronto, IAE Business and Management School, Universidad Austral, and University of Texas at Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/whycolumbia/placement/|title=Columbia Business School Doctoral Program Placement|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constantin Dumitru Beldie''' (September 8, 1887 – June 11, 1954)&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Nicolae Oprea, [http://www.romlit.ro/calendar1111111111117 "Calendar"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 36/2013; [http://www.romlit.ro/calendar111111111115 "Calendar"], in ''România Literară'', Nr. 23/2013&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Romania]]n journalist, publicist, and civil servant, famous for his [[libertine]] lifestyle and his unapologetic, sarcastic, memoirs of life in the early 20th century. After modest but happy beginnings in life, Beldie played a small but essential part in the promotion of [[literary modernism]], building bridges between the mainstream and the avant-garde. He became a pioneer of cultural journalism at ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'', before moving on to ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'' and ultimately ''[[Cuvântul]]'', befriending (and secretly resenting) philosopher-journalist [[Nae Ionescu]]. Like Ionescu, he promoted a [[Vitalism|vitalistic]] perspective on society and culture, veering into [[antiintellectualism]] after 1918.

While working in the field of journalism and cultural criticism, Beldie advanced through the ranks of the bureaucracy, and held several important assignments between 1919 and 1935. He was the lover of female journalist [[Cora Irineu]], and was possibly responsible for her suicide in 1924. This was only one of his many philandering affairs, some of them discussed in Beldie's own recollections of the period. These politically-charged manuscripts were published, with a noted delay, in 2000.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Born in [[Bucharest]],&lt;ref name="amajmemorii"&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Majuru, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/MEMORII.-Constantin-BELDIE-Memorii.-Caleidoscopul-unei-jumatati-de-veac-in-Bucuresti-(1900-1950)*articleID_4796-articles_details.html "Constantin Beldie, ''Memorii''. Caleidoscopul unei jumătăți de veac în București (1900-1950)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 132, September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Beldie grew up in the ''[[mahala]]'' of [[Saint Ilie-Gorgani Church|Gorgani]], just south of [[Cișmigiu Gardens]].&lt;ref name="ornea"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Zigu Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/dezvluirile_lui_constantin_beldie "Dezvăluirile lui Constantin Beldie"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 46/2000&lt;/ref&gt; He was a second-generation Bucharester, with his paternal family stemming from the western province of [[Oltenia]]. On that side, he descended from an old line of ''[[pandur]]'' rebels, called ''Beldie'', ''Băldan'', or ''Pietraru''. His great-grandfather Nicolae, Beldie recalled, participated in the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|1821 uprising]], only to betray the revolutionary cause, and then settled with other renegade ''pandurs'' on the [[Vâlsan River (Argeș)|Vâlsan River]] floodplain.&lt;ref&gt;Leonăchescu, "Pandurii lui Tudor", p.21-25&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, Ghiță Beldie, resided in [[Mușătești|Stroeștii Argeșului]], but traded in ''[[țuică]]'' all over the [[Argeș River]] valley.&lt;ref&gt;Leonăchescu, "Pandurii lui Tudor", p.23-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Beldie's father, Dumitru, left the impoverished countryside for a life in the city; his father and brothers, however, were committed to the a peasant life, and benefited from the [[Land reform in Romania|land reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonăchescu, "Pandurii lui Tudor", p.23, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Dumitru, a restaurant owner, was a sympathizer of [[socialism]], acquainted with a number of prominent contemporary Romanians.&lt;ref name="grigurcu"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/memoriile_unui_hedonist "Memoriile unui hedonist"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 41/2000&lt;/ref&gt; Young Beldie received a [[progressive education]], which even included enrollment in [[pre-kindergarten]]. He was later given private lessons in French, German and English, in addition to attending school, and took classes in dance and bicycling.&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt;

However, Beldie grew up mainly on the streets, describing life in the half-rural Bucharest of his youth as "patriarchal, lazy, prosperous and good-to-all".&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; His summers were spent in the countryside, traveling with Ghiță Beldie on the trade route between Vâlsan region and Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Leonăchescu, "Pandurii lui Tudor", p.23, 24&lt;/ref&gt; He observed [[Westernization]] and [[urbanization]] as a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] outsider,&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; commenting sarcastically on the universal spread of petty corruption and lassitude.&lt;ref name="amajmemorii"/&gt; Beldie went to the [[Saint Sava National College]], followed by the [[Gheorghe Șincai National College (Bucharest)|Gheorghe Șincai Gymnasium]].&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alsănd23"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Al. Săndulescu]], [http://ateneu.info/wp-content/uploads/2009_06-07.pdf "Constantin Beldie (fragment)"], in ''Ateneu'', Nr. 6-7/2009, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; His time in school was an annoyance, and he twice failed to get his remove, passing his finishing exams in private.&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt; He would later complain of the [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishments]] he received in class, and that Saint Sava "did not teach us anything, did not urge us to accomplish anything".&lt;ref name="amajmemorii"/&gt;

Beldie took a break from schooling, and worked various odd jobs, notably as a clerk in a [[medical laboratory]], a choir singer for the [[Romanian Patriarchal Cathedral|Metropolitan Church]], and a village teacher.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt; One of [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]'s closest collaborators, in 1908 he became a secretary at the latter's magazine ''Noua Revistă Română'', remaining there until 1916. This period introduced Beldie to the [[Pan-European identity|Europeanist]] ideology of Rădulescu-Motru and [[Ion Trivale]], who criticized the nationalist stances of schools such as [[Poporanism]] and ''[[Sămănătorul]]''; Rădulescu-Motru struck Beldie as "wise" and "kind", but too pedantic when it came to assessing art.&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt; He also quickly learned the editing and typographical trades, as well as the administrative tasks involved in preparing a magazine.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt;

===Debut in cultural journalism===
Soon, Beldie became a close observer of the day's literary and scientific milieu, reviewing the correspondence exchanged between ''Noua Revistă Română'' and [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; As a literary chronicler and [[Letter to the editor|LTTE]] recipient, he helped discover writers such as [[Tudor Arghezi]], [[George Bacovia]],&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; and [[Felix Aderca]]. He personally intervened to have Aderca's poems published in ''Noua Revistă Română'' (1913),&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Anca Marina Rădulescu, [http://cis01.ucv.ro/litere/activ_st/anale_literatura/revista_2010.pdf "Felix Aderca. Contribuții biografice: etapa craioveană"], in the [[University of Craiova]] ''Anale. Seria Științe Filologice'', Nr. 1-2/2010, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; but was much annoyed by Aderca's "contentious and categorical" nature.&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt; Allegedly, Beldie also met the literary innovator and prankster [[Urmuz]].&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt; Beldie also worked on and off as a translator of [[French literature]] for [[Editura Librăriei Leon Alcaly|Alcaly Publishers]],&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt; whose [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanian]] owner, he recalled, was utterly illiterate.&lt;ref name="amajmemorii"/&gt; He became passionate about [[Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly|J. Barbey d'Aurevilly]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Anatole France]], [[Remy de Gourmont]], [[Jean Moréas]], [[Jean Richepin]], and [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]].&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; In 1915, he translated and prefaced Villiers' ''Le secret de l'échafaud''.&lt;ref name="onofrei&amp;al.328"&gt;Neonila Onofrei, Lucreția Angheluță, Liana Miclescu, Cornelia Gilorteanu, Tamara Teodorescu, ''Bibliografia românească modernă (1831–1918). Vol. I: A-C'', [[Editura științifică și enciclopedică]], Bucharest, 1984, p.328&lt;/ref&gt;

With such professional credentials, Beldie was asked to contribute on other publishing projects, and became close to the burgeoning [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Symbolist movement]]. He met and befriended, or quarreled with, a host of Symbolists and post-Symbolists, leaving characterological notes on [[Adrian Maniu]], [[N. Davidescu]], [[Emil Isac]], and [[Mihail Sorbul]].&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt; Together with [[I. Dragoslav]], he was one of the non-Symbolists involved with [[Ion Minulescu]]'s Symbolist tribune, ''Insula''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Cernat]], ''Avangarda românească și complexul periferiei: primul val'', [[Cartea Românească]], Bucharest, 2007, p.27. {{ISBN|978-973-23-1911-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the younger Symbolists, Beldie also took a keen interest in avant-garde aesthetics. He claimed to have played a personal part in bringing [[Expressionism]] to Romania, but was perplexed by [[Cubism]], and declared himself unconvinced by Marinetti's [[Futurism]].&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; He not only disliked Futurism, but contended that its promoters at ''Noua Revistă Română'', including [[Ramiro Ortiz (academic)|Ramiro Ortiz]], were Italian [[Proto-fascism|proto-fascist]] nationalists and [[Agent of influence|agents of influence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.romdidac.ro/custom_images/06.pdf "Note despre receptarea futurismului italian în România antebelică"], in ''Ex Ponto'', Nr. 6/2005, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one of his new friends was Nae Ionescu, with whom he would quarrel and reunite several times before 1940. According to Beldie's own testimony, they were both intrepid womanizers and self-seekers.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; Ionescu, Beldie claims, was "not taken seriously" as an author, mainly because "he wouldn't take himself seriously".&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; The "Gypsy-like knave" Ionescu was, according to Beldie, "a loser before it was his time to lose".&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt; Joining their circle were Aderca and Maniu. Both of them, Beldie claims, squandered their talent on artistically irrelevant, lucrative, work.&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt;

Beldie himself was notorious for his [[hedonism]], later confessing: "I have been a philanderer by nature all my life, but I was not a jealous one."&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; He also admitted having been a confidant of women, "their comrade and blood-brother", and of thus receiving their sexual favors, but also claimed to have participated in at least one public sex orgy.&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; He was a long-haired [[dandy]] with "languid eyes", taking special care in his appearance, which included such fashionable items as a [[Panama hat|Panama]] or a [[bowler hat]], [[Detachable collar|celluloid collar]], a [[frock coat]], [[nacre]] buttons, and a walking cane.&lt;ref name="ștagopscrisori"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ștefan Agopian]], "Scrisori bănățene (o poveste de dragoste)", in ''[[Dilemateca]]'', October 2006, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his libertine outlook, on July 29, 1910 Beldie married the actress Eugenia Gh. Ionescu, with whom he lived on Schitul Maicilor Street, Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Leonăchescu "Un secol de la nașterea..." (I), p.42-43&lt;/ref&gt; On August 29, 1912, Eugenia gave birth to a son, Alexandru "Puiu" Beldie.&lt;ref&gt;Leonăchescu "Un secol de la nașterea..." (I), p.43, 47&lt;/ref&gt; This did not prevent Beldie from pursuing other women. Enrolling at the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of Philosophy and Literature, he met [[Cora Irineu]], who became passionately in love with him, and whom Beldie helped introduce to literary life.&lt;ref name="ștagopscrisori"/&gt; Eventually graduating in 1912, Beldie was drafted into the [[Romanian Land Forces]] during the [[Second Balkan War]].&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; He was a teacher from 1913 to 1947 in the fields of Romanian language, professional education and project management.&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt;

===Essayist and civil servant===
[[File:Conferințele Ideii Europene, 1921.jpg|thumb|370px|Letterhead announcing the ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'' Conference of November 1921. From the invitation addressed by Beldie to poet [[Emil Isac]]]]
Beldie was again drafted into the Land Forces for the [[World War I]] [[Romania during World War I|Romanian campaign]] (1916-1918).&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; During this time, his dislike of formalism had matured into vitalism and antiintellectualism.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; As Beldie later put it, the Romanian intellectual class had the artistic tastes of "prostitutes", being virtually incapable of producing "an original idea of its own". The youth, given to the "drunkenness twinned with whoring", would only read the football pages of ''[[Gazeta Sporturilor]]''.&lt;ref name="amajmemorii"/&gt; Its "intellectual and moral crisis", Beldie claimed, had to do with "organic weakness", "exotic" intellectual habits, but also with "an insufficient training or an all-too-early lassitude".&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt;

The ideological stance fueled Beldie's 1918 essay ''Glossa spiritului cărturăresc'' ("Gloss on the Bookish Spirit") as well as, attributively,&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bcposterit"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Barbu Cioculescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/posteritatea_unui_memorialist "Posteritatea unui memorialist"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 7/2006&lt;/ref&gt; the [[aphorism]]s published as ''Ce vrem? Catechism pentru suflete nehotărîte'' ("What Is It We Want? A Catechism for Indecisive Souls"). Both were came out with Yellow Books (''Cărți Galbene''), an imprint of [[Editura Minerva]],&lt;ref name="onofrei&amp;al.328"/&gt; and were seen by reviewers of the day as illustrating "a heroic concept of life".&lt;ref name="cărțirom528"&gt;"Cărți românești", p.528&lt;/ref&gt; According to critic [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], Beldie should be regarded as an immediate but "modest" precursor for Ionescu's own brand of philosophic vitalism, or ''[[Trăirism]]''.&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; To contemporary readers, he appeared more like an inconsistent follower of [[pragmatism]], in the vein of [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} "Mișcarea filosofică", in [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/27633/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_192906_1915_1916_008_001.pdf ''Aspecte din filosofia contimporană. I-a serie''], Editura Studii Filosofice, Bucharest, 1919, p.192 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of intellectualism, Beldie proposed a new brand of [[elitism]] and, historian Adrian Majuru notes, saw his as "a solitary life among the idiots".&lt;ref name="amajmemorii"/&gt; In ''Catechism'', Beldie declared that: "There is no greater misfortune than when the strongest people on earth are not also the most obeyed by mankind. Because then all things are false, monstrous, and everything runs backwards."&lt;ref name="cărțirom528"/&gt; He advised youth not to be ashamed of "their weaknesses, their tics, and their passions", suggesting that "they provide one's life with color, freshness, and the picturesque."&lt;ref&gt;"Cărți românești", p.529&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Beldie became editorial secretary at another of Rădulescu-Motru's magazines, ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'', which took over the old offices of ''Noua Revistă Română''.&lt;ref name="incealaltă"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ionel Necula, [http://www.ideeaeuropeana.ro/download/februarie_2010_reader.pdf "Cealaltă ''Idee Europeană''"], in ''[[Contemporanul]]'', Nr. 2/2010, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed him to organize a series of conferences held in various cities by, among others, Nae Ionescu, Ortiz, Irineu, [[Octav Onicescu]], [[Mircea Florian]], [[Virgil Bărbat]], and [[Emanoil Bucuța]].&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; At the time, he became close friends with another ''Ideea Europeană'' contributor, the Jewish essayist [[Henric Sanielevici]].&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; Beldie was not especially visible in this company of intellectuals, but contributed a rather popular satirical column, ''Aplauze și fluierături'' ("Applause and Heckling"), and put to bed each printed issue.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; He soon began his affair with Irineu, leaving with her on official assignments to [[Transylvania]]. To the irritation of his ''Ideea Europeană'' friends, these trips turned into sexual escapades, with both Beldie and Irineu neglecting their real tasks.&lt;ref name="ștagopscrisori"/&gt; In 1922, Irineu left alone for an extended trip in [[Banat]] area, while Beldie stated behind in Bucharest. The letters he received from her convinced him that she was an outstanding reporter, and, on this basis, he pruned their content and published them as a separate column in ''Ideea Europeană''.&lt;ref name="ștagopscrisori"/&gt;

From around 1919, Beldie was also working as a teacher at the Superior School for Arts and Crafts, in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="incealaltă"/&gt; Having served as department head for the Social Reform Society (1919-1924), under sociologist [[Dimitrie Gusti]], he was at the time a commercial director at Centrala Cărții publishing house and director of [[Editura Cultura Națională]] (1924-1928).&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt; As Beldie later recounted, this assignment pitied him against Nae Ionescu: according to Beldie, Ionescu was responsible for a major fraud, which he tried to pin down on Centrala Cărții.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; While at Cultura Națională, he arranged Irineu's letters for publishing as a volume.&lt;ref name="ștagopscrisori"/&gt;

===Final decades===
On February 11, 1924, Irineu committed suicide by revolver. This was due either to Beldie's philandering (which probably caused some of his other lovers to kill themselves)&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; or, as he asserts in his memoirs, a family illness that also claimed several of her siblings.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; Another version has it that she was driven to despair when Beldie intervened between her and her other admirer, Bucuța.&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt; Beldie arranged for her burial at [[Bellu cemetery]], and put out a final version of her letters and essays.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt;

With Rădulescu-Motru, Beldie frequented the salon of [[Alexandrina Cantacuzino]]. They joined her Union of Intellectuals club in 1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Carmen Brăgaru, [http://www.romdidac.ro/custom_images/36.pdf "Ion Pillat și Liga Națiunilor"], in ''Ex Ponto'', Nr. 3/2012, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; but Beldie left sarcastic notes about the intellectual abilities of its other members.&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; ''Ideea Europeană'' ceased publication in 1928.&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; That year, Beldie became director of ''[[Cuvântul]]'' daily, headed by Ionescu—who, in 1930, joined the [[camarilla]] surrounding the authoritarian [[King of Romania|King]], [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]].&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; Beldie himself became head of [[Imprimeria Națională]] (1930-1932), before becoming assistant director and then director for the [[Census in Romania|census]] (1930-1932),&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; in which capacity he was well paid.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; He was eventually head of [[Loteria Română|Loteria de Stat]] (1932-1935).&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt;

In 1933, Ionescu defected to the [[Iron Guard]], a [[Fascism|fascist]] movement opposed to Carol II. As documented by Beldie, his wealth grew over the coming years, as he became the representative of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-linked [[IG Farben]] in Romania, and included villas in [[Băneasa]] and [[Balcic]] and a [[Mercedes-Benz]] car with a chauffeur paid by the firm.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; Beldie, instead, retired from public life. He was embittered by Ionescu's politics, describing him as a "ham actor" on the [[far right]] and religious scene, a figure of "turpitude, cynicism, amorality".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Voicu]], [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/pdf-1/Sfera_69.pdf "Mitul Nae Ionescu (V)"], in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 69/1999, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] and the early years of the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]], Beldie lived in relative obscurity. From his retirement at age sixty until his death, he had financial difficulties and had to work as a proofreader for various publishers, eventually being forced to sell his personal book collection.&lt;ref name="grigurcu"/&gt; During the early 1950s, Beldie began compiling and reviewing his scattered memoirs, in [[samizdat]] form. He only gave private readings, and was hailed by critic [[Vladimir Streinu]], who attended such events, as Romania's answer to [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]].&lt;ref name="bcposterit"/&gt; To minimize the risk of communist arrest and imprisonment, Beldie only dealt with the more distant past,&lt;ref name="bcposterit"/&gt; with the notable exception of his chapter on Arghezi. This portion, which was not read in front of Arghezi, claimed that Arghezi was a compulsive liar, and discussed in detail the issue of his uncertain family origins.&lt;ref name="bcposterit"/&gt;

Beldie was supported morally and financially by old literary friends, including Arghezi and literary critic [[Tudor Vianu]], who greatly enjoyed reading fragments from the work.&lt;ref name="alsănd23"/&gt; He visited the house of another literary promoter, [[Șerban Cioculescu]], his portrait picture prominently displayed in the lobby. Working clandestinely and under [[Securitate]] surveillance, Cioculescu collected memoirs of the previous regime; he organized reunions at which Beldie met other such late debutants, including politician [[Petre Ghiață]] and former counterespionage operative George "Geacă" Borneanu.&lt;ref name="bcposterit"/&gt;

Beldie was survived by his son Alexandru, whom he had educated in accordance with ''Glossa spiritului cărturăresc'', encouraging him to take up mountaineering.&lt;ref&gt;Leonăchescu, "Un secol de la nașterea..." (I), p.47-48&lt;/ref&gt; Beldie Jr became a distinguished [[Dendrology|dendrologist]], forestry engineer, and environmentalist. Like his father before him, he was also a bohemian.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; He fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and spent 1944-1945 as a prisoner of war in [[Oranki]],&lt;ref&gt;Leonăchescu, "Un secol de la nașterea..." (I), p.43; (II), p.47&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to teach in Romania. He was married thrice, but had no children.&lt;ref&gt;Leonăchescu, "Un secol de la nașterea..." (II), p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Beldie looked forward to the promise of [[liberalization]], believing that his bitter memoirs would eventually be given [[imprimatur]] by the communist authorities.&lt;ref name="bcposterit"/&gt; He was worried that they would never be published in full, so he asked his literary friends, including Arghezi, Vianu, Cioculescu, and [[Perpessicius]], to make sure no part of them went missing.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bcposterit"/&gt; Alexandru Beldie, underpromoted in his field of work because of his anticommunism and structural nonconformity, then forcefully retired,&lt;ref&gt;Leonăchescu, "Un secol de la nașterea..." (II), p.41, 42-43, 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; took up the task of raising awareness of his father's samizdat work. He preserved the manuscripts and, in the 1970s, presented them to [[Zigu Ornea]], director of [[Editura Minerva]]. Although Ornea gave his approval, the memoirs were blocked from publication by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]], due to a chapter on Nae Ionescu. Despite the chapter's sharply critical tone, the regime's policy was not to publish any mention of Ionescu.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], Ornea and [[Nicolae Manolescu]] arranged for the Ionescu chapter to be published in ''[[România Literară]]''.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt;

The work only appeared in 2000, with [[Editura Albatros]]. As critics note, they were only printed in an altered form—with the Ionescu chapter conspicuously absent, probably cut out from the manuscript entirely.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bcposterit"/&gt; According to Ornea, this may be because Ionescu disciple [[Dan Zamfirescu]], who reviewed the manuscripts for publishing at his own [[Editura Roza Vânturilor]], wanted them lost.&lt;ref name="ornea"/&gt; In 2005, however, Zamfirescu published ''Oameni văzuți de aproape'' ("People Seen from Up Close"), which reputedly covers the previously abridged part of Beldie's memoirs, and features notes that often challenge Beldie's account.&lt;ref name="bcposterit"/&gt;

Alexandru Beldie died on June 4, 2003, some 3 years after the original book saw print, in what his colleagues describe as undeserved anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;Leonăchescu, "Un secol de la nașterea..." (II), p.41, 44, 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; Constantin's memoirs were enjoying the attention of literary critics, including [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]], who reviewed them together with a mass of recovered samizdats.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Literatura-romana-in-post-ceausism*articleID_4622-articles_details.html "Literatura română în post-ceaușism"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 35, October 2000; Smaranda Vultur, [http://www.revista22.ro/transparentele-literaturii-confesive-ii-1146.html "Transparențele literaturii confesive (II)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 757, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3970">A '''degree completion program''' is an undergraduate academic program, most frequently found in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], that is offered within an established university but designed for [[non-traditional student]]s.
Degree completion programs are typically structured to allow persons who previously completed a substantial portion of the requirements for an undergraduate degree, but who have been separated from the university setting for a period of time, to complete the credit requirements needed to earn a [[bachelor's degree]] (B.A.), either at an accelerated pace, or a flexible schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=|first=|date=1 March 2011 |title=Bachelor's Degree Completion Program Helps Adult Learners |url=http://www.usnewsuniversitydirectory.com/articles/college-offers-bachelors-degree-completion-program_11301.aspx#.UutvFPldUrU |publisher=U.S. News University Directory |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between credits previously earned, and those required for the award of a B.A., are made-up through a variety of methods depending on the sponsoring institution, but typically include a combination of traditional university courses and [[College Level Examination Program|CLEP examinations]].

==Examples== 
* [[Georgetown University]] bills its degree completion program as designed for students who were "meaning to complete" their bachelor's degree, but for whom "life, work and other obligations got in the way". Applications are accepted from working adults who have completed one or two years of university courses which can be transferred onto the potential student's Georgetown [[transcript (education)|transcript]]. A series of evening and weekend classes fills the gap between credits earned and those required for a bachelor's degree. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liberal Studies|url=http://scs.georgetown.edu/departments/4/bachelor-of-arts-in-liberal-studies |publisher=Georgetown University |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The degree completion program at the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] is open to applicants who have completed 70-credits of university level course work. Once enrolled, students take a twice-weekly, evening class over the course of four semesters; those who successfully complete the 15-month instructional sequence are awarded a Bachelor of Arts in [[Liberal Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Evening Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies Program|url=http://www.pacific.edu/Academics/Schools-and-Colleges/Gladys-L-Benerd-School-of-Education/Academics/Accelerated/EdPro2-(Evening-BA-in-Liberal-Studies).html |publisher=University of the Pacific |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Colorado State University]] offers a degree completion program in [[psychology]]. Students can transfer up to 90 credits of coursework taken at another university before completing the final 30 credits required for a B.A. degree through [[distance learning]] psychology courses at Colorado State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Psychology|url=http://www.online.colostate.edu/degrees/psychology/ |publisher=Colorado State University |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University of San Francisco]] offers a Bachelor of Science in Management to working professionals who are interested in completing their degree. Students who have completed at least 60 semester credits may apply to the program and can earn their degree in as little as 23 months. Students take two courses each semester, and studies include accounting, finance, marketing, organizational behavior and theory, analytics, technology, logistics, and other core competencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bachelor of Science in Management (BSM)|url=https://www.usfca.edu/management/undergraduate-programs/management|publisher=University of San Francisco|accessdate=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ThD is an advanced research degree equivalent to the [[Doctor of Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structure of U.S. Education Systems: Research Doctorate Degrees|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Program Standards|url=https://www.ats.edu/uploads/accrediting/documents/degree-program-standards.pdf|website=ATS|publisher=Association of Theological Schools|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
In the academic study of theology, which is deeply rooted in the Christian tradition, doctoral students are often conferred a Doctor of Theology, a [[Doctor of Philosophy]], a [[Doctor of Ministry]], a [[Doctor of Practical Theology]] or Doctor of Sacred Theology. However, the [[Doctor of Ministry]] is generally understood as a [[professional doctorate]].
=== United States ===
In the United States, some of the older theological seminaries began offering the Doctor of Theology as an equivalent to the research [[Doctor of Philosophy]]. In [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], for example, this practice was inherited from the German system of education since the professors involved in establishing the doctoral program were trained in German Universities. Princeton Theological Seminary has since switched to using Doctor of Philosophy as its main designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phd75.ptsem.edu/history/|title=History - PhD Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=phd75.ptsem.edu|publisher=Princeton Theological Seminary|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar shift happened at [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hds.harvard.edu/academics/degree-programs|title=Degree Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=hds.harvard.edu|publisher=Harvard Divinity School|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only [[Association of Theological Schools]] accredited schools currently accepting students to ThD programs are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member School Advanced Search|url=https://www.ats.edu/member-schools/member-school-advanced-search?title=&amp;field_ms_primary_denomination_value=&amp;field_ms_degrees_offered_value=ThD&amp;field_ms_has_comprehensive_value=&amp;circle_op=%3C&amp;circle[value]=&amp;circle[unit]=miles&amp;circle[location]=|website=ATS|publisher=Association of Theological Schools|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the Doctor of Theology is a fairly new doctoral program.

'''Education in Moldova''' is currently the responsibility of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Research (Moldova)|Ministry of Education, Culture and Research]].

== History ==
In 1990, the average Moldovan spent six years in school, and only 30% of people older than 15 had completed secondary education. After the end of Soviet rule, reforms were established that required nationals to receive a basic education over 10 years, followed by enrollment in a technical school or an  institution of higher learning.{{sfn|Sheehan|2000|p=64}}

==Grading conventions==
The lowest grade (mark) in the Moldovan educational system is 1, the highest is 10. To pass a course, a subject, or an exam, the student must obtain a mark of 5 or above.

==Types of education==
As of 2007-2008 academic year, Moldova had ten types of primary and secondary schools:
*Kindergartens take kids from 3 to 5-6 years.
*[[Primary school]]s, grades 1-4
*[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]s, grades 5-9
*[[Lyceum]]s, grades 10-12, [[Baccalauréat|Bacalaureat]] exam
*General schools, grades 10-11, no Bacalaureat exam, cannot continue with higher education 
*Evening schools
*Schools of trades, 1 year (grade 12), no Bacalaureat exam, cannot continue with higher education 
*[[Vocational school]]s, 3 years (grades 10-12), no Bacalaureat exam, but can continue with higher education
*Vocational lyceums, 3 years (grades 10-12), Bacalaureat exam
*Colleges (''Colegii''), 3 to 4 years, Bacalaureat exam optional, but can continue with higher education
*[[Special education|Special schools]], grades 1-11, no Bacalaureat exam, cannot continue with higher education

==Higher education==
{{See also|List of universities in Moldova}}
In [[Moldova]], there are 16 state and 15 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/links/National-reports-2007/National_Report_moldova2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/links/National-reports-2007/National_Report_moldova2007.pdf Report on Moldova's education in 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; private institutions of [[higher education]], with a total of 126,100 [[student]]s, including 104,300 in the state institutions, and 21,700 in the private ones. The number of students per 10,000 inhabitants in Moldova has been constantly growing since the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], reaching 217 in 2000-2001, and 351 in 2005-2006. 

There are 6,200 faculty members in Moldova's [[university|universities]], institutes and academies (on average 1 faculty member per 20.3 students). Out of these, only 2,700 (43%) hold [[PhD|PhD degree]]s, including 358 (5.8%) that also hold the highest academic degree:
[[Habilitation]]. Moldovan faculty members usually teach around 20 hours per week (one of the highest workloads in the world).

52.5% of students major in [[economics]], [[law]], [[social sciences]], or in some fields that the Moldovan Ministry of Education calls on its website "professional formation fields", 18.4% study [[engineering]] and [[architecture]], 16.0% - [[education]]. There are a total of 90 specialities (majors) offered.

101,100 students, or 80.2%, pay for their studies (from 2,000 to 7,300 [[Moldovan Leu|Moldovan lei]] per year, i.e. from 120 to 430 [[euro]]s per year). The state is trying to increase the number of places offered free of charge when students are admitted to public universities: there were 5,085 in 2001, 5,290 in 2002, 5,628 in 2003, 6,354 in 2004, 7,048 in 2005, 7,835 in 2006, but this rate (54% over 5 years) is lower than the rate of increase (65% over the same period) in the total number of places. 15% of the free of charge places are reserved, and distributed to candidates from low-income families. In an effort to support them, the state gives scholarships to 70% of students who occupy the free of charge places, i.e. to 14.4% of the total number of students. As of January 1, 2006, these scholarships are in three categories: 210, 230, or 270 Moldovan lei per month, i.e. 12, 14, or 16 euros per month respectively. 

78.4% of students study in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], roughly corresponding to its respective linguistic group,&lt;ref name="statisticamd"&gt;[http://www.statistica.md/public/files/publicatii_electronice/Educatia/Educatia%20_RM_2011.pdf Educația în Republica Moldova], p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistica.md/recensamint/Nationalitati_de_baza_ro.xls 2004 Census results]&lt;/ref&gt; while 19.5% study in [[Russian language|Russian]] (including members of other linguistic groups like Gagauz or Bulgarian).&lt;ref name="statisticamd" /&gt; Foreign languages became increasingly less popular in recent years: 1.8% studied in [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]] during the 2010-2011 schoolyear, compared to 3.2% in 2006.&lt;ref name="statisticamd" /&gt;

The National Council on Accreditation and Attestation is an organization that approves the examination programs for doctoral students, confers scientific degrees, and scientific and pedagogical ranks. The Council publishes online all PhD theses  that are elaborated and defended in Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnaa.acad.md/en/ NCAA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The curriculum===
At present, the graduates get two types of diplomas: one type for fulfilling the curriculum and the ''Licence'' examination, and a second type, if in addition they write a Licence Diploma paper.
 
The Ministry of Education defines its strategic objective for higher education to be "the integration into the European common space for higher education, and active participation in its construction". In 2005 Moldova signed the commitment to implement the [[Bologna process]] agreements. In view of this, several changes have been operated since:
*reorganization from September 1, 2005 of the higher education into an [[undergraduate]] cycle of 3–4 years, and a [[Master's degree|master]] cycle of 1-2 year
*commitment to copy European laws and adopt them wholesale
*elaboration and implementation of a ''Framework Plan'' for the first cycle (undergraduate)
*elaboration of a new ''Classification List of Specialities'' for the undergraduate cycle
*elaboration of an ''Implementation Guide'' for a to be ''National System of Transferable Credits'', and institutionalization of this system in all universities and colleges
*implementation of the introduction of an ''educational record from'' in a unique European format, as a supplement to the ''Licence diploma''

The Ministry of Education's declared objectives in taking these actions are:
* improvement of the quality of the country's higher education
* increasing the national and international mobility of students and faculty 
* taking and implementing "European university education values" into the educational system of Moldova

The quality of the higher education has been declared a [[:wikt:priority|priority]]. In this context, a prime priority is declared to the implementation of the ''National Framework of Qualifications for Professional Formation'', which will determine the "educational finalities and competences", the "compulsory minimum of realization in higher education", and will somehow facilitate the rise in "the quality of the preparation of graduates for the national economy", and will also somehow contribute to "ensuring the continuous rise of the quality of education".

Universities and colleges are told to start creating own "systems of internal management of quality", with the aim of "organizing the internal process of ensuring the quality, in accordance with national standards, and the demands of external evaluation systems".

'''Elizabeth Blackwell''' (February 3, 1821 – May 31, 1910) was a British physician, notable as the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States, and the first woman on the [[General Medical Council|Medical Register of the General Medical Council]]. Elizabeth Blackwell played an important role in both the United States and the United Kingdom as a social and moral reformer. She acted as a pioneer in promoting the education of [[women in medicine]]. Elizabeth Blackwell's contributions remain celebrated through an Elizabeth Blackwell medal that is awarded to one woman every year who has added to the cause of promoting women in medicine. Furthermore, [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart and William Smith College]] recently created a statue on their campus honoring Elizabeth Blackwell. 

Elizabeth Blackwell was initially uninterested in a career in medicine especially after her schoolteacher brought in a bull's eye to use as a teaching tool.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elizabeth Blackwell|last=Stevenson|first=Kiera|publisher=Great Neck Publishing|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, she became a schoolteacher in order to support her family. This occupation was seen as suitable for women during the 1800s, however, being a schoolteacher did not interest Blackwell. Blackwell's motivation to go into medicine came after her friend fell ill and suggested that if a female doctor had cared for her, she might not have suffered so much.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Blackwell began to apply to medical schools, however, she endured a lot of prejudice due to her gender. She was rejected from all the medical schools she applied to except [[Geneva Medical College]]. In 1847 Blackwell became the first woman to attend medical school in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Elizabeth Blackwell had her inaugural thesis on typhoid fever published in the ''[[The BMJ|Buffalo Medical Journal]]'' right after she graduated college in 1849.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SANES|first=SAMUEL|date=1944|title=ELIZABETH BLACKWELL: HER FIRST MEDICAL PUBLICATION|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/44440963|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|volume=16|issue=1|pages=83–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article was the first medical article published by a female student from the United States. Her article portrayed a strong sense of empathy and sensitivity to human suffering as well as a strong desire for social and economic justice. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This point of view was considered very feminine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, in 1857, Blackwell also opened up the [[New York Infirmary for Women and Children]] with her sister Emily. She also gave lectures to women about the importance of educating girls.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1910|title=Elizabeth Blackwell, M.D., Consulting Physician, New Hospital For Women|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25291104|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=2581|pages=1523–1524}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Early life==

Elizabeth was born on February 3, 1821, in Bristol, England to Samuel Blackwell, who was a sugar refiner, and his wife Hannah (Lane) Blackwell. She had two older siblings, Anna and Marian, and would eventually have six younger siblings: [[Samuel Charles Blackwell|Samuel]] (married [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell|Antoinette Brown]]), [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry]] (married [[Lucy Stone]]), [[Emily Blackwell|Emily]] (third woman in the U.S. to get a medical degree), [[Sarah Ellen Blackwell|Sarah Ellen]] (a writer), John and George. She also had four maiden aunts: Barbara, Ann, Lucy, and Mary, who also lived with them. 

In 1832, the family emigrated from Bristol, England to New York because Samual Blackwell had lost their most profitable sugar refinery to a fire. &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1910|title=Elizabeth Blackwell, M.D., Consulting Physician, New Hospital For Women|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25291104|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=2581|pages=1523–1524}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, her father became active in abolitionist work. Therefore, their dinnertime discussions often surrounded issues such as women's rights, slavery, and child labor. These liberal discussions reflected Hannah and Samual's attitudes toward child rearing. For example, rather than beating the children for bad behavior, Barbara Blackwell recorded their trespasses in a black book. If the offenses accumulated, the children would be exiled to the attic during dinner. Samual Blackwell was similarly liberal in his attitude towards the education of his children. Samuel Blackwell was a [[Congregationalist]] and exerted a strong influence over the religious and academic education of his children. He believed that each child, including his girls, should be given the opportunity for unlimited development of their talents and gifts. This perspective was rare during that time, as most people believed that the women's place was in the home or as a schoolteacher. Blackwell had not only a governess, but private tutors to supplement her intellectual development.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elizabeth Blackwell|last=Stevenson|first=Kiera|publisher=Great Neck Publishing|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, she was rather socially isolated from all but her family as she grew up.  

A few years after the family moved to New York, the family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. When Blackwell was 17 her father passed away, leaving the family with very little money.  

===Early adulthood===
The Blackwells' financial situation was unfortunate. Pressed by financial need, the sisters Anna, Marian and Elizabeth started a school, ''The Cincinnati English and French Academy for Young Ladies'', which provided instruction in most, if not all, subjects and charged for tuition and room and board. The school was not terribly innovative in its education methods&amp;nbsp;– it was merely a source of income for the Blackwell sisters.&lt;ref name=Diaryb&gt;Elizabeth Blackwell, Diary, 19–21 December 1838 (Blackwell Family Papers, Library of Congress).&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwell's abolition work took a back seat during these years, most likely due to the academy.&lt;ref name="Sahli"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elizabeth Blackwell, M.D., (1871–1910): A Biography|last=Sahli|first=Nancy Ann|publisher=Arno Press|year=1982|isbn=0-405-14106-8|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwell converted to [[Episcopalianism]], probably due to her sister Anna's influence, in December 1838, becoming an active member of St. Paul's Episcopal Church. However, [[William Henry Channing]]'s arrival in 1839 to Cincinnati changed her mind. Channing, a charismatic Unitarian minister, introduced the ideas of [[transcendentalism]] to Blackwell, who started attending the [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian Church]]. A conservative backlash from the Cincinnati community ensued, and as a result, the academy lost many pupils and was abandoned in 1842. Blackwell began teaching private pupils.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

Channing's arrival renewed Blackwell's interests in education and reform. She worked at intellectual self-improvement: studying art, attending various lectures, writing short stories and attending various religious services in all denominations ([[Quaker]], [[Millerism|Millerite]], [[Jewish]]). In the early 1840s, she began to articulate thoughts about women's rights in her diaries and letters and participated in the Harrison political campaign of 1840.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

In 1844, with the help of her sister Anna, Blackwell procured a teaching job that paid $1,000 per year in [[Henderson, Kentucky|Henderson]], [[Kentucky]]. Although she was pleased with her class, she found the accommodations and schoolhouse lacking. What disturbed her most was that this was her first real encounter with the realities of slavery. "Kind as the people were to me personally, the sense of justice was continually outraged; and at the end of the first term of engagement I resigned the situation."&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackwell|first1=Elizabeth|title=Pioneer Work in Opening the Medical Profession to Women: Autobiographical Sketches|date=1895|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|location=London and New York|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/blackwell/pioneer/pioneer.html|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Cincinnati only half a year later, resolved to find a more stimulating way to spend her life.&lt;ref name="Pioneer"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/reader?id=GHkIAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;source=gbs_atb_hover Blackwell, Elizabeth, and Millicent Garrett Fawcett. ''Pioneer Work in Opening the Medical Profession to Women''. London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1914. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===Pursuit of medical education===
Once again, through her sister Anna, Blackwell procured a job, this time teaching music at an academy in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], [[North Carolina]], with the goal of saving up the $3,000 necessary for her medical school expenses. In Asheville, Blackwell lodged with the respected Reverend John Dickson, who happened to have been a physician before he became a clergyman. Dickson approved of Blackwell's career aspirations and allowed her to use the medical books in his library to study. During this time, Blackwell soothed her own doubts about her choice and her loneliness with deep religious contemplation. She also renewed her antislavery interests, starting a slave Sunday school that was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

Dickson's school closed down soon after, and Blackwell moved to the residence of Reverend Dickson's brother, [[Samuel Henry Dickson]], a prominent [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] physician. She started teaching in 1846 at a boarding school in Charleston run by a Mrs. Du Pré. With the help of Reverend Dickson's brother, Blackwell inquired into the possibility of medical study via letters, with no favorable responses. In 1847, Blackwell left Charleston for [[Philadelphia]] and New York, with the aim of personally investigating the opportunities for medical study. Blackwell's greatest wish was to be accepted into one of the Philadelphia medical schools.&lt;ref name=Pioneer/&gt;

{{quote|My mind is fully made up. I have not the slightest hesitation on the subject; the thorough study of medicine, I am quite resolved to go through with. The horrors and disgusts I have no doubt of vanquishing. I have overcome stronger distastes than any that now remain, and feel fully equal to the contest. As to the opinion of people, I don't care one straw personally; though I take so much pains, as a matter of policy, to propitiate it, and shall always strive to do so; for I see continually how the highest good is eclipsed by the violent or disagreeable forms which contain it.&lt;ref name=Biography/&gt;}}

Upon reaching Philadelphia, Blackwell boarded with Dr. William Elder and studied anatomy privately with Dr. Jonathan M. Allen as she attempted to get her foot in the door at any medical school in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name = Sahli/&gt; She was met with resistance almost everywhere. Most physicians recommended that she either go to [[Paris]] to study or that she take up a disguise as a man to study medicine. The main reasons offered for her rejection were that (1) she was a woman and therefore intellectually inferior, and (2) she might actually prove equal to the task, prove to be competition, and that she could not expect them to "furnish [her] with a stick to break our heads with". Out of desperation, she applied to twelve "country schools".

===Medical education in the United States===
[[File:EBlackwell1905.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Elizabeth Blackwell by [[Joseph S. Kozlowski|Joseph Stanley Kozlowski]], 1963. ''Syracuse University Medical School collection.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/place_settings/elizabeth_blackwell|title=Brooklyn Museum: Elizabeth Blackwell|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In October 1847, Blackwell was accepted as a medical student by [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]], then called [[Geneva Medical College]], located in upstate New York. The dean and faculty, usually responsible for evaluating an applicant for matriculation, were not able to make a decision due to the special nature of Blackwell's case. They put the issue up to a vote by the 150 male students of the class with the stipulation that if one student objected, Blackwell would be turned away. The young men voted unanimously to accept her.&lt;ref name="Curtis 1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=Robert H.|title=Great Lives: Medicine|year=1993|publisher=Atheneum Books for Young Readers|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter&gt;Smith, Stephen. Letter. ''The Medical Co-education of the Sexes''. ''New York Church Union''.  1892.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Blackwell arrived at the college, she was rather nervous. Nothing was familiar&amp;nbsp;– the surroundings, the students, and the faculty. She did not even know where to get her books. However, she soon found herself at home in medical school.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;  While she was at school, she was looked upon as an oddity by the townspeople of Geneva. She also rejected suitors and friends alike, preferring to isolate herself. In the summer between her two terms at Geneva, she returned to Philadelphia, stayed with Dr. Elder, and applied for medical positions in the area to gain clinical experience. The Guardians of the Poor, the city commission that ran [[Blockley Almshouse]], granted her permission to work there, albeit not without some struggle. Blackwell slowly gained acceptance at Blockley, although some young resident physicians still would walk out and refuse to assist her in diagnosing and treating her patients. During her time there, Blackwell gained valuable clinical experience but was appalled by the syphilitic ward and those afflicted with [[typhus]]. Her graduating thesis at Geneva Medical College was on the topic of typhus. The conclusion of this thesis linked physical health with socio-moral stability&amp;nbsp;– a link that foreshadows her later reform work.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

On January 23, 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to achieve a medical degree in the United States. The local press reported her graduation favorably, and when the dean, Dr. Charles Lee, conferred her degree, he stood up and bowed to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.hws.edu/library/archives/pdfs/tripp.pdf |title=Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell's Graduation: An Eye-Witness Account by Margaret Munro De Lancey|publisher=Hobart and William Smith Colleges|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031212033218/http://academic.hws.edu/library/archives/pdfs/tripp.pdf|archivedate=12 December 2003|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical education in Europe===
In April, 1849, Blackwell made the decision to continue her studies in Europe. She visited a few hospitals in Britain and then headed to Paris. Her experience there was similar to her experience in America; she was rejected by many hospitals because of her gender. In June, Blackwell enrolled at La Maternité; a "[[lying-in]]" hospital,&lt;ref name="Curtis 1993"/&gt; under the condition that she would be treated as a student midwife, not a physician. She made the acquaintance of Hippolyte Blot, a young resident physician at ''La Maternité''. She gained much medical experience through his mentoring and training. By the end of the year, Paul Dubois, the foremost obstetrician in his day, had voiced his opinion that she would make the best obstetrician in the United States, male or female.&lt;ref name=Pioneer/&gt;

On 4 November 1849, when Blackwell was treating an infant with [[ophthalmia neonatorum]], she spurted some contaminated solution into her own eye accidentally and contracted the infection. She lost sight in her left eye, causing her to have her eye surgically extracted and thus lost all hope of becoming a surgeon.&lt;ref name=Pioneer/&gt; After a period of recovery, she enrolled at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in London in 1850. She regularly attended [[James Paget]]'s lectures. She made a positive impression there, although she did meet some opposition when she tried to observe the wards.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

Feeling that the prejudice against women in medicine was not as strong there, Blackwell returned to New York City in 1851 with the hope of establishing her own practice.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

==Career==

===Medical career in the United States===
Stateside, Blackwell was faced with adversity, but did manage to get some media support from entities such as the ''[[New-York Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name=Pioneer/&gt; She had very few patients, a situation she attributed to the stigma of women doctors as abortionists. In 1852, she began delivering lectures and published ''The Laws of Life with Special Reference to the Physical Education of Girls'', her first work, a volume about the physical and mental development of girls that concerned itself with the preparation of young women for motherhood.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;
[[File:NYinfirmary.jpg|thumb|right|The Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary. [Announcement, 1868–69].]]
In 1853, Blackwell established a small dispensary near [[Tompkins Square Park|Tompkins Square]]. She also took [[Marie Zakrzewska]], a Polish woman pursuing a medical education, under her wing, serving as her preceptor in her pre-medical studies. In 1857, Dr. Marie Zakrzewska, along with Blackwell and her sister Emily, who had also obtained a medical degree, expanded Blackwell's original dispensary into the [[New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children]]. Women served on the board of trustees, on the executive committee and as attending physicians. The institution accepted both in- and outpatients and served as a nurse's training facility. The patient load doubled in the second year.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

===Civil War efforts===
When the [[American Civil War]] broke out, the Blackwell sisters aided in nursing efforts. Blackwell sympathized heavily with the North due to her abolitionist roots, and even went so far as to say she would have left the country if the North had compromised on the subject of slavery.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;Elizabeth Blackwell. Blackwell, along with Emily Blackwell and Mary Livermore, played an important role in the development of the United States Sanitary Commission. Letters to Barbara Bodichon. 29 Jan 1859. 25 Nov 1860. 5 June 1861 (Elizabeth Blackwell Collection, Special Collections, Columbia University Library).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Blackwell did meet with some resistance on the part of the male-dominated [[United States Sanitary Commission]]. The male physicians refused to help with the nurse education plan if it involved the Blackwells. In response to the USSC, Blackwell organized with the Woman's Central Relief Association. The WCRA worked against the problem of uncoordinated benevolence, but ultimately was absorbed by the USSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Silber|first=Nina|title=Daughters of the Union: Northern Women Fight the Civil War|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-674-01677-7|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the New York Infirmary managed to work with [[Dorothea Dix]] to train nurses for the Union effort.&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;

===Medical career at home and abroad===
Blackwell made several trips back to Britain to raise funds and to try to establish a parallel infirmary project there. In 1858, under a clause in the [[Medical Act 1858|Medical Act of 1858]] that recognised doctors with foreign degrees practicing in Britain before 1858, she was able to become the first woman to have her name entered on the General Medical Council's medical register (1 January 1859).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moberly Bell|first=Enid|title=Storming the Citadel: The Rise of the Woman Doctor|year=1953|publisher=Constable &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also became a mentor to [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]] during this time. By 1866, nearly 7,000 patients were being treated per year at the New York Infirmary, and Blackwell was needed back in the United States. The parallel project fell through, but in 1868, a medical college for women adjunct to the infirmary was established. It incorporated Blackwell's innovative ideas about medical education&amp;nbsp;– a four-year training period with much more extensive clinical training than previously required.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

At this point, a rift occurred between Emily and Elizabeth Blackwell. Both were extremely headstrong, and a power struggle over the management of the infirmary and medical college ensued.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt; Elizabeth, feeling slightly alienated by the United States women's medical movement, left for Britain to try to establish medical education for women there. In July 1869, she sailed for Britain.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

In 1874, Blackwell established a women's medical school in [[London]] with [[Sophia Jex-Blake]], who had been a student at the New York Infirmary years earlier. Blackwell had doubts about Jex-Blake and thought that she was dangerous, belligerent, and tactless.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Blackwell. Letter to Samuel C. Blackwell. 21 Sep 1874. (Blackwell Family Papers, Library of Congress).&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Blackwell became deeply involved with the school, and it opened in 1874 as the [[London School of Medicine for Women]], with the primary goal of preparing women for the licensing exam of [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|Apothecaries Hall]]. Blackwell vehemently opposed the use of [[vivisection]]s in the laboratory of the school.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

After the establishment of the school, Blackwell lost much of her authority to Jex-Blake and was elected as a lecturer in midwifery. She resigned this position in 1877, officially retiring from her medical career.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

While Blackwell viewed medicine as a means for social and moral reform, her student [[Mary Putnam Jacobi]] focused on curing disease. At a deeper level of disagreement, Blackwell felt that women would succeed in medicine because of their humane female values, but Jacobi believed that women should participate as the equals of men in all medical specialties.&lt;ref&gt;Regina Morantz, "Feminism, Professionalism and Germs: The Thought of Mary Putnam Jacobi and Elizabeth Blackwell," ''American Quarterly'' (1982)  34:461–478.

===Time in Europe&amp;nbsp;– social and moral reform===
[[File:elizabeth blackwell stamp.JPG|thumb|right|Blackwell was commemorated on a U.S. postage stamp in 1974, designed by [[Joseph S. Kozlowski|Joseph Stanley Kozlowski]]. Syracuse University Medical School collection.]]

After leaving for Britain in 1869, Blackwell diversified her interests, and was active both in social reform and authorship. She co-founded the National Health Society in 1871. She perceived herself as a wealthy gentlewoman who had the leisure to dabble in reform and in intellectual activities&amp;nbsp;– the income from her American investments supported her.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt; She was rather occupied with her social status, and her friend, [[Barbara Bodichon]] helped introduce Blackwell into her circles. She travelled across Europe many times during these years, in [[England]], [[France]], [[Wales]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

Her greatest period of reform activity was after her retirement from the medical profession, from 1880–1895. Blackwell was interested in a great number of reform movements&amp;nbsp;– mainly moral reform, sexual purity, hygiene and medical education, but also preventative medicine, sanitation, [[eugenics]], family planning, women's rights, [[Fourierism|associationism]], [[Christian socialism]], medical ethics and [[antivivisection]]&amp;nbsp;– none of which ever came to real fruition.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt; She switched back and forth between many different reform organisations, trying to maintain a position of power in each. Blackwell had a lofty, elusive and ultimately unattainable goal: evangelical moral perfection. All of her reform work was along this thread. She even contributed heavily to the founding of two utopian communities: [[Herbert Vincent Mills|Starnthwaite]] and [[Hadleigh, Essex|Hadleigh]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

She believed that the Christian morality ought to play as large a role as scientific inquiry in medicine and that medical schools ought to instruct students in this basic truth. She also was antimaterialist and did not believe in vivisections. She did not see the value of inoculation and thought it dangerous.  She believed that bacteria were not the only important cause of disease and felt their importance was being exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackwell|first=Elizabeth|title=Why Hygienic Congresses Fail|year=1892|publisher=G. Bell|location=London|url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/6078178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She campaigned heavily against licentiousness, [[prostitution]] and [[contraceptives]], arguing instead for the [[rhythm method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackwell|first=Elizabeth|title=A Medical Address on the Benevolence of [[Malthus]], Contrasted with the Corruptions of Neo-Malthusianism|year=1888|publisher=T. W. Danks &amp; Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She campaigned against the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], arguing that it was a pseudo-legalisation of prostitution. Her 1878 ''Counsel to Parents on the Moral Education of their Children'' was an essay on prostitution and [[marriage]] arguing against the Contagious Diseases Acts. She was conservative in all senses except that she believed women to have sexual passions equal to those of men, and that men and women were equally responsible for controlling those passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackwell|first=Elizabeth|title=Counsel to Parents on the Moral Education of their Children|year=1890|publisher=Brentano's Literary Emporium|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jicAAAAAYAAJ&amp;oe=UTF-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others of her time believed women to have little if any sexual passion, and placed the responsibility of moral policing squarely on the shoulders of the woman. The book was controversial, being rejected by 12 publishers, before being printed by [[Hatchards|Hatchard and Company]]. The [[Galley proof|proofs]] for the original edition were destroyed by a member of the publisher's board and a change of title was required for a new edition to be printed.

==Personal life==

===Friends and family===
Blackwell was well connected, both in the United States and in the United Kingdom. She exchanged letters with [[Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron|Lady Byron]] about women's rights issues, and became very close friends with [[Florence Nightingale]], with whom she discussed opening and running a hospital together. She remained lifelong friends with Barbara Bodichon, and met [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] in 1883. She was close with her family, and visited her brothers and sisters whenever she could during her travels.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

However, Blackwell had a very strong personality, and was often quite acerbic in her critique of others, especially of other women. Blackwell had a falling out with Florence Nightingale after Nightingale returned from the [[Crimean War]]. Nightingale wanted Blackwell to turn her focus to training nurses, and could not see the legitimacy of training female physicians.&lt;ref name="letter" /&gt; After that, Blackwell's comments upon Florence Nightingale's publications were often highly critical.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Barry Blackwell.  Letter to Alice Stone Blackwell. 24 Mar 1877. (Blackwell Family Papers, Library of Congress)&lt;/ref&gt; She was also highly critical of many of the women's reform and hospital organisations in which she played no role, calling some of them "quack auspices".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Blackwell. Letter to Emily Blackwell. 23 Jan 1855. (Blackwell Family Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe College)&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwell also did not get along well with her more stubborn sisters Anna and Emily, or with the women physicians she mentored after they established themselves ([[Marie Zakrzewska]], [[Sophia Jex-Blake]] and [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]]). Among women at least, Blackwell was very assertive and found it difficult to play a subordinate role.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

===Kitty Barry===
[[File:Elizabeth Blackwell, 1905.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Blackwell, 1905. Courtesy of Blackwell Family Papers, Schlesinger Library. Photograph of an older Elizabeth Blackwell with her adopted daughter Kitty and two dogs, 1905.]]

In 1856, when Blackwell was establishing the New York Infirmary, she adopted Katherine "Kitty" Barry (1848-1936), an [[Ireland|Irish]] orphan from the [[New York House of Refuge|House of Refuge]] on [[Randalls and Wards Islands|Randall's Island]]. Diary entries at the time show that she adopted Barry half out of loneliness and a feeling of obligation, and half out of a utilitarian need for domestic help.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Blackwell. Letter to Emily Blackwell. 1 Oct 1856. (Blackwell Family Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe College)&lt;/ref&gt; Barry was brought up as a half-servant, half-daughter.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

Blackwell did provide for Barry's education. She even instructed Barry in gymnastics as a trial for the theories outlined in her publication, ''The Laws of Life with Special Reference to the Physical Education of Girls''.&lt;ref name="letter" /&gt; However, Blackwell never permitted Barry to develop her own interests. She didn't make an effort to introduce Barry to young men or women of her age. Barry herself was rather shy, awkward and self-conscious about her slight deafness.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt; Barry followed Blackwell during her many trans-Atlantic moves, during her furious house hunt between 1874 and 1875, during which they moved six times, and finally to Blackwell's final home, Rock House, a small house off Exmouth Place in [[Hastings]], [[Sussex]], in 1879.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

Barry stayed with Blackwell all her life. After Blackwell's death, Barry stayed at Rock House, and then moved to [[Kilmun]] in [[Argyllshire]], [[Scotland]], where Blackwell was buried in the churchyard of [[St Munn's Parish Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 4078-4079). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, she moved in with the Blackwells and took the Blackwell name. On her deathbed, in 1930, Barry called Blackwell her "true love", and requested that her ashes be buried with those of Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Alice Stone. ''Tribute to Kttty Barry''. ''Vineyard Gazette''. 19 June 1936. (Blackwell Family Papers, Library of Congress)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private life===
[[File:Elizabeth Blackwell headstone.jpg|thumb|right|Blackwell's headstone at [[Kilmun Parish Church and Argyll Mausoleum|St Munn's Parish Church]], [[Kilmun]], Scotland]]

None of the five Blackwell sisters ever married. Elizabeth thought courtship games were foolish early in her life, and prized her independence.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt; When commenting on the young men trying to court her during her time in [[Kentucky]], she said: "...do not imagine I am going to make myself a whole just at present; the fact is I cannot find my other half here, but only about a sixth, which would not do."&lt;ref name=Pioneer/&gt; Even during her time at Geneva Medical College, she rejected advances from a few suitors.&lt;ref name=Pioneer/&gt;

There was one slight controversy, however, in Blackwell's life related to her relationship with Alfred Sachs, a 26-year-old man from [[Virginia]]. He was very close with both Kitty Barry and Blackwell, and it was widely believed in 1876 that he was a suitor for Barry, who was 29 at the time. The reality was that Blackwell and Sachs were very close, so much so that Barry felt uncomfortable being around the two of them. Sachs was very interested in Blackwell, then 55 years old. Barry was in love with Sachs, and was mildly jealous of Blackwell.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Barry Blackwell. Letter to Alice Stone Blackwell. 24 March 1877. (Blackwell Family Papers, Library of Congress).&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwell thought that Sachs lived a life of dissipation and believed that she could reform him. In fact, the majority of her 1878 publication ''Counsel to Parents on the Moral Education of the Children'' was based on her conversations with Sachs. Blackwell stopped correspondence with Alfred Sachs after the publication of her book.&lt;ref name= Sahli/&gt;

===Last years and death===
Blackwell, in her later years, was still relatively active. In 1895, she published her autobiography, ''Pioneer Work in Opening the Medical Profession to Women''. It was not very successful, selling fewer than 500 copies.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt; After this publication, Blackwell slowly relinquished her public reform presence, and spent more time traveling. She visited the United States in 1906 and took her first and last car ride. Blackwell's old age was beginning to limit her activities.&lt;ref name=Sahli/&gt;

In 1907, while holidaying in [[Kilmun]], Scotland, Blackwell fell down a flight of stairs, and was left almost completely mentally and physically disabled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argyllmausoleum.org/index.asp?pageid=373042 Argyll Mausoleum, Elizabeth Blackwell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230090134/http://www.argyllmausoleum.org/index.asp?pageid=373042 |date=30 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 1910, she died at her home in Hastings, Sussex, after suffering a stroke that paralyzed half her body. Her ashes were buried in the graveyard of [[Kilmun Parish Church and Argyll Mausoleum|St Munn's Parish Church, Kilmun]], and obituaries honouring her appeared in publications such as ''[[The Lancet]]''&lt;ref name="LancetObituary"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/details/LancetObituary06111910 | title=Obituary | journal=Lancet | year=1910 | volume=175 | issue=4528 | pages=1657–1658 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)51682-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The British Medical Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="BMJObituary"&gt;{{cite journal | title=[[:s:BMJ Obituary of Elizabeth Blackwell|Obituary, Elizabeth Blackwell, M.D.]] | journal=BMJ | year=1910  | volume=1 | pages=1523–1524 | doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2581.1523-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British artist [[Edith Holden]], whose Unitarian family were Blackwell's relatives, was given the middle name "Blackwell" in her honor.{{library resources box|by=yes|onlinebooksby=yes|viaf=17291291}}

==Legacy==
=== Influence ===
After Elizabeth Blackwell graduated from University in 1849, her thesis on typhoid fever was published in the ''[[The BMJ|Buffalo Medical Journal]].''&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SANES|first=SAMUEL|date=1944|title=ELIZABETH BLACKWELL: HER FIRST MEDICAL PUBLICATION|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/44440963|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|volume=16|issue=1|pages=83–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857, Blackwell opened up the [[Lower Manhattan Hospital|New York Infirmary for Women]] with her younger sister Emily. At the same time, she also gave lectures to women in The United States and England about the importance of educating women and the profession of medicine for women. &lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1910|title=Elizabeth Blackwell, M.D., Consulting Physician, New Hospital For Women|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25291104|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=2581|pages=1523–1524}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the audience at one of her lectures in England, was a woman named [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]] who later became the first woman doctor in England in 1865.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Furthermore, Blackwell played a large role during the [[civil war]] in organizing the nurses. In 1874, Blackwell worked together with [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Sophia Jex-Blake]], [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]], [[Emily Blackwell]], and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in order to create the first medical school for women in England called, [[London School of Medicine for Women]]. Blackwell acted as the Chair of Hygiene.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Blackwell settled in England in the 1870s and continued with working on expanding the profession of medicine for women. She influenced as much as 476 women to become registered medical women in England alone.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Up until her death, Blackwell worked in an active practice in Hastings, England. She still did lectures at the School of Medicine for Women. Throughout her lifetime, she authored, ''The Laws of Life in Relation to the Physical Education of Girls'', ''The Human Element in Sex, The Religion of Health,'' and ''The Moral Education of the Young in Relation.'' &lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

=== Honors ===
Two institutions honour Elizabeth Blackwell as an alumna:

* [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]], the current name of Geneva College, the founding institution of Geneva Medical College
* [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) at Syracuse, which acquired Geneva Medical College in 1950 and renamed it "[[State University of New York Upstate Medical University]]" in 1999.

Since 1949, the [[American Medical Women's Association]] has awarded the [[Elizabeth Blackwell Medal]] annually to a woman physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Blackwell Letters, circa 1850–1884|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4079307/|publisher=Columbia University Libraries|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]] awards an annual [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges#Elizabeth Blackwell Award|Elizabeth Blackwell Award]] to women who have demonstrated "outstanding service to humankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Blackwell Award|url=http://www.hws.edu/about/blackwell.aspx|publisher=Hobart and William Smith Colleges|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auditory, visual, and tactile presentations by the system respond to tactile input from the operator, which user input in turn depends upon the auditory, visual, and tactile feedback from the system.&lt;ref name=Bordegoni/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fukuda/&gt;]]
'''Enactive interfaces''' are interactive systems that allow organization and transmission of knowledge obtained through action. Examples are interfaces that couple a human with a machine to do things usually done unaided, such as shaping a three-dimensional object using multiple modality interactions with a data base,&lt;ref name=Fukuda/&gt; or using interactive video to allow a student to visually engage with mathematics concepts.&lt;ref name=Held/&gt; Enactive interface design can be approached through the idea of raising awareness of [[affordances]], that is, optimization of the awareness of possible actions available to someone using the enactive interface.&lt;ref name=Stoffregen/&gt; This optimization involves visibility, affordance, and feedback.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zudilova/&gt;

The enactive interface in the figure interprets manual input and provides a response in perceptual terms in the form of images, sounds, and haptic (tactile) feedback. The system is called enactive because of the feedback loop in which the system response is decided by the user input, and the user input is driven by the perceived system responses.&lt;ref name=Bordegoni/&gt;

Enactive interfaces are new types of [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interface]] that express and transmit the enactive knowledge by integrating different sensory aspects. The driving concept of enactive interfaces is then the fundamental role of motor action for storing and acquiring knowledge (action driven interfaces). Enactive interfaces are then capable of conveying and understanding gestures of the user, in order to provide an adequate response in perceptual terms. Enactive interfaces can be considered a new step in the development of the human-computer interaction because they are characterized by a closed loop between the natural gestures of the user (efferent component of the system) and the perceptual modalities activated (afferent component). Enactive interfaces can be conceived to exploit this direct loop and the capability of recognizing complex gestures.

The development of such interfaces requires the creation of a common vision between different research areas like [[computer vision]], [[Haptic perception|haptic]] and sound processing, giving more attention on the motor action aspect of interaction. An example of prototypical systems that are able to introduce enactive interfaces are reactive robots, robots that are always in contact with the human hand (like current play console controllers, [[Wii Remote]]) and are capable of interpreting the human movements and guiding the human for the completion of a manipulation task.

==Enactive knowledge==
Enactive knowledge is information gained through perception–action interaction in the environment. In many aspects the enactive knowledge is more natural than the other forms both in terms of the learning process and in the way it is applied in the world. Such knowledge is inherently [[multimodal interaction|multimodal]] because it requires the co-ordination of the various senses. Two key characteristics of enactive knowledge are that it is ''experential'': it relates to doing and depends on the user's experience, and it is ''cultural'': the way of doing is itself dependent upon social aspects, attitudes, values, practices, and legacy.&lt;ref name=Bordegoni/&gt;

Enactive interfaces are related to a fundamental interaction concept that often is not exploited by existing [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interface]] technologies. As stated by cognitive psychologist [[Jerome Bruner]], the traditional interaction with the information mediated by a computer is mostly based on symbolic or iconic knowledge, and not on enactive knowledge.&lt;ref name=Slee/&gt; While in the symbolic way of learning knowledge is stored as words, mathematical symbols or other symbol systems, in the iconic stage knowledge is stored in the form of visual images, such as diagrams and illustrations that can accompany verbal information. On the other hand, enactive knowledge is a form of knowledge based on active participation, knowing by doing, by living rather than thinking.&lt;ref name=Slee2/&gt;
:"Any domain of knowledge (or any problem within that domain of knowledge) can be represented in three ways: by a set of actions appropriate for achieving a certain result (enactive representation); by a set of summary images or graphics that stand for a concept without defining it fully (iconic representation); and by a set of symbolic or logical propositions drawn from a symbolic system that is governed by rules or laws for forming and transforming propositions (symbolic representation)"&lt;ref name=Bruner/&gt;

A particular form of knowledge is a ''[[skill]]'', juggling being a simple example, and the acquisition of a skill is one area where enactive knowledge is evident. The sensorimotor and cognitive activities involved in acquiring skills are tabulated by the SKILLS FP6 European skills project.&lt;ref name=Bardy&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multimodal interfaces==
Multimodal interfaces are a good candidate for the creation of ''Enactive interfaces'' because of their coordinated use of [[Haptic perception|haptic]], sound and vision. Such research is the main objective of the ENACTIVE [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Network of Excellence]], a European consortium of more than 20 research laboratories that are joining their research effort for the definition, development and exploitation of enactive interfaces.

==ENACTIVE Network of Excellence==
The research on enactive knowledge and enactive interfaces is the objective of the ENACTIVE Network of Excellence. A Network of Excellence is a [[European Economic Community|European Community]] research instrument that provides fundings for the integration of the research activities of different research laboratories and institutions. The ENACTIVE NoE started in 2004 with more than 20 partners with the objective of ''the creation of a multidisciplinary research community with the aim of structuring the research on a new generation of human-computer interfaces called Enactive Interfaces.''. The aim of this NoE is not only the research on enactive interfaces by itself, but also the integration of the partners through a Virtual Laboratory and the spreading of the expertise and knowledge of the Network.

Since 2004, the partners, coordinated by the PERCRO laboratory, have improved both the theoretical aspects of enaction, through seminars and the creation of a [[lexicon]], and the technological aspects necessary for the creation of enactive interfaces. Every year the status of the ENACTIVE NoE is presented through an international conference.&lt;ref name=PERCRO/&gt;

'''Europa Nostra''' ([[Latin]] for "Our Europe") is a pan-European Federation for [[cultural heritage|Cultural Heritage]], representing citizens’ organisations that work on safeguarding Europe's cultural and [[natural heritage]]. It is the voice of this movement to relevant international bodies, in particular the [[European Union]], the [[Council of Europe]] and [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europanostra.org/ |title=Europa Nostra website |publisher=Europanostra.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has consultative status with UNESCO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/member-states/ngos-and-foundations |title=UNESCO |publisher=UNESCO |date= |accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is recognised as an NGO partner.

==Organisation and objectives==
Europa Nostra's network covers almost 50 countries across Europe and beyond. It is composed of over 250 member organisations (heritage associations and foundations with a combined membership of more than 5 million people), 150 associated organisations (governmental bodies, local authorities and corporations) and also 1500 individual members who directly support the mission of Europa Nostra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europanostra.org/membership-/ |title=Europa Nostra membership |publisher=Europanostra.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europa Nostra's main goal is to place heritage and its benefits in the mainstream of public consciousness and to make heritage a higher priority for public policy both at European and national levels. Its specific objectives are to promote, at a European level, high standards of quality in the fields of [[heritage conservation]], architecture, urban and rural planning and to advocate a balanced and [[sustainable development]] of urban and rural, built and natural environment. Europa Nostra also seeks to highlight the importance of cultural heritage as a building block of European identity and as contributing to a strengthening sense of [[European citizenship]].

Its activities are coordinated by an International Secretariat based in [[The Hague]] (Netherlands) headed by Europa Nostra's Secretary General, Sneška Quaedvlieg-Mihailović (Netherlands/Serbia). In several countries, the International Secretariat is assisted in its tasks by country representations.

Europa Nostra's main activities are: 
# to act as a representative lobby for cultural heritage in Europe 
# to celebrate and promote excellence through the [[European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards]]; 
# to save Europe's historic monuments, sites and cultural landscapes which are in danger, and 
# to animate a network of cultural heritage stakeholders in Europe.

==History==
Europa Nostra was founded in 1963 on the initiative of [[Italia Nostra]], as a response to the serious threat to the survival of [[Venice]], caused by regular flooding. In 1991 it merged with the ''Internationales Burgen Institut'' (the International Castles Institute), itself created in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europanostra.org/history |title=History of Europa Nostra |publisher=Europanostra.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Europa Nostra is presided over by world-renowned opera singer Maestro [[Plácido Domingo]] (Spain), and its Executive President is Denis de Kergorlay (France). Previous presidents have been [[Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz|HRH the Infanta Doña Pilar de Borbón]] from Spain (2007–2009), [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|HRH the Prince Consort of Denmark]] (1990–2007) and [[Hans de Koster]] from the Netherlands (1984–1990).

== Lobby for cultural heritage ==
Acting as a European cultural heritage lobby, Europa Nostra seeks to secure adequate support for [[cultural heritage]] in various areas of European policy-making and funding. It advocates the need to take cultural heritage into consideration when formulating and implementing all European and national policies which have an impact – direct or indirect – on heritage. Europa Nostra also seeks to highlight the importance and the specific character of cultural heritage within the wider cultural and policy agenda of its international partners, the [[European Union]], [[Council of Europe]], and [[UNESCO]].

During its European Heritage Congress held in [[Amsterdam]] (June 2011), Europa Nostra and 27 other European and international networks and organisations active in the wider field of cultural heritage decided to set up the [[European Heritage Alliance 3.3]].

In March 2010, Europa Nostra opened a liaison office in [[Brussels]], whose task is to coordinate Europa Nostra's lobbying of EU institutions and other European and international bodies based in Brussels, [[Strasbourg]] and Paris.

The European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage/Europa Nostra Awards reward excellence in [[cultural heritage]] [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]], ranging from the restoration of buildings and their adaptation to new uses, to urban and rural landscape rehabilitation, [[archaeological site]] interpretations, and care for art collections. Moreover, it highlights research, dedicated service to heritage conservation by individuals or organisations, and education projects related to cultural heritage. The awards are supported by the [[Creative Europe]] programme. It has been organised by Europa Nostra since 2002. 
 
This awards scheme aims to promote high standards and high-quality skills in conservation practice and to stimulate trans-frontier exchange in heritage protection. By spreading the "Power of Example", the awards also aim to encourage further efforts and projects related to heritage throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.europanostra.org/heritage-awards/ |title=Europa Nostra website |publisher=Europa Nostra |date= |accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/culture/our-programmes-and-actions/prizes/cultural-heritage_en.htm/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629033443/http://ec.europa.eu/culture/our-programmes-and-actions/prizes/cultural-heritage_en.htm/ |date=29 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europa Nostra is the main partner of "[[The Best in Heritage]]", an annual presentation of awarded museum, heritage, and conservation projects, which takes place in the second part of September in the world heritage town of [[Dubrovnik]] (Croatia).

==Heritage in Danger==
Europa Nostra supports national and international campaigns for the preservation and rescue of Europe's heritage which is in danger. In January 2013 it launched with the [[European Investment Bank|European Investment Bank Group]], represented by the [[European Investment Bank|EIB]] Institute, the [[7 Most Endangered Programme]] to identify endangered monuments and sites in Europe and mobilize public and private partners on a local, national and European level to find a future for those sites, working as a catalyst for action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_BEI-13-10_en.htm |title=‘The 7 Most Endangered’ Programme launched |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7 Most Endangered sites and monuments for 2013 were selected from a shortlist of 14 prepared by an international panel that reviewed 40 nominations from member organizations from 21 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/19/most-endangered-european-heritage-sites_n_3294405.html |title=The 14 Most Endangered European Heritage Sites |publisher=Huffington Post |date=2013-05-19 |accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Europa Nostra has raised its voice to save endangered historic monuments, sites or landscapes in Europe such as:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2295">On August 11, 2000, [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] signed '''Executive Order 13166''', "Improving Access to Services for Persons with [[Limited English proficiency]]".  The [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] requires [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]] to examine the services they provide, identify any need for services to those with limited [[English language|English]] proficiency (LEP), and develop and implement a system to provide those services so LEP persons can have meaningful access to them.  It is expected that agency plans will provide for such meaningful access consistent with, and without unduly burdening, the fundamental mission of the agency.  The Executive Order also requires that the Federal agencies work to ensure that recipients of Federal financial assistance provide meaningful access to their LEP applicants and beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/cor/13166.htm Executive Order 13166], ''[[U.S. Department of Justice]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

To assist Federal agencies in carrying out these responsibilities, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] issued [http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/cor/13166.htm LEP Guidance] that set forth the compliance standards that recipients of Federal financial assistance must follow to ensure that their programs and activities normally provided in English are accessible to LEP persons and thus do not discriminate on the basis of national origin in violation of Title VI's prohibition against national origin discrimination.

'''Frank Conroy''' (January 15, 1936 – April 6, 2005) was an American author. He published five books, including the highly acclaimed memoir ''[[Stop-Time]]''. Published in 1967, this ultimately made Conroy a noted figure in the literary world. The book was nominated for the [[National Book Award]].

==Early life and education==
Frank Conroy was born on January 15, 1936 in [[New York, New York]] to an American father and a Danish mother. Conroy graduated from [[Haverford College]], and was director of the influential [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]] for 18 years, from 1987 until 2005, where he was also F. Wendell Miller Professor. He was previously the director of the literature program at the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] from 1982 to 1987.

==Writing==
Conroy's published works include the memoir ''[[Stop-Time]]'' (1967); a collection of short stories, ''Midair'' (1985); a novel, ''Body and Soul'' (1993), which is regarded as one of the finest evocations of the experience of being a musician; a collection of essays and commentaries, ''Dogs Bark, but the Caravan Rolls On: Observations Then and Now'' (2002); and a travelogue, ''Time and Tide: A Walk Through Nantucket'' (2004). His fiction and non-fiction have appeared in such journals as ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[GQ]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' and ''[[Partisan Review]]''. He was named a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government.

==Jazz piano==
In addition to writing, Conroy was an accomplished jazz pianist, winning a [[Grammy Award]] in 1986 for liner notes. His book ''Dogs Bark, But the Caravan Rolls On: Observations Then and Now'' includes articles that describe jamming with [[Charles Mingus]] and with [[Charlie Watts]] and [[Bill Wyman]]. The latter session occurred when Conroy was writing about the [[Rolling Stones]] for ''Esquire''. Conroy had arrived at a mansion for the interview, found nobody there, and eventually sat down at a grand piano and began to play. Someone wandered in, sat down at the drums, and joined in with accomplished jazz drumming; then a fine jazz bassist joined in. They turned out to be Watts and Wyman, whom Conroy did not recognize until they introduced themselves after the session.

==Death and recognition==
Conroy died of [[colon cancer]] on April 6, 2005, in [[Iowa City, Iowa]], at the age of 69. The Frank Conroy Reading Room in the Dey House, the home of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, was named in his honor.

Conroy is the subject of ''Mentor: A Memoir'' by Tom Grimes, his former student at the Iowa Writers Workshop and long-time friend.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tomgrimes.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator''''' (often abbreviated to '''''FFPS''''' and otherwise known as '''''Five Nights at Freddy’s 6''''') is a [[Point-and-click game|point-and-click]] [[Business simulation game|business simulation]] [[survival horror]] [[video game]] created by [[Scott Cawthon]]. It is the sixth official main installment of the ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's]]'' game series. The game was released on December 4, 2017 for free on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and Gamejolt.

==Gameplay==
''Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator'' begins as an [[Third generation of video game consoles|8-bit]] game, where the player must control Freddy Fazbear, the titular character of ''Five Nights at Freddy's'', and distribute pizzas to several children. The gameplay of that section of the game eventually ends in a "[[glitch]]", which was input on purpose.

The game then switches to a dark room where the player faces a broken animatronic with an appearance similar to Circus Baby from ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]'' (referred to as “Scrap Baby”)''.'' A voice from a [[Cassette deck|cassette]] instructs the player to observe the animatronic and document their responses to various audio stimulations. A checklist must be filled containing the options "no", "yes", and "unsure". If the player feels the animatronic is about to perform a jumpscare, then they are able to subdue it using a [[taser]]. However, the animatronic loses value if it is tasered more than three times, lowering the amount of possible profit that could be obtained from it. If the player is successful in this portion of the game, they earn a cash reward. If the player is unsuccessful, no cash reward will be obtained. On the other hand, the player can refuse to salvage the animatronic, and discard it. The player must complete this task with a different animatronic after each of the first four in-game dayshifts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.player.one/freddy-fazbears-pizzeria-simulator-guide-gameplay-lore-endings-122094|title=Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria Simulator Guide - Gameplay Lore &amp; Endings|date=2017-12-05|work=Player.One|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An introduction cutscene featuring Tutorial Unit is shown to the player, then the game takes a turn to business simulation, where the player buys decorations for their fictional restaurant and places them around the restaurant. Buying these items can increase the atmosphere, health/safety, and entertainment standards, with the possibility of also giving them extra revenue. However, many of these items can also increase liability and lead to lawsuits which can be fought or settled, both at the cost of money. Sponsorship offers can be accepted for money but can cause audio distractions for the player later in the game. Arcade games placed in the restaurant can also be interacted with to play mini-games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The next portion of the game sees the player using a computer to complete various tasks to maintain the restaurant. However, any dysfunctional or hostile animatronics loose in the establishment will try to attack the player. They can be stopped by shining the player's flashlight into the [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] openings, or by using audio to lure animatronics away.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The player can use a network of motion detectors to track the animatronics' movements from one location to another. Unlike the previous games in the series, all four animatronics in the game (Scrap Baby, Molten Freddy, Springtrap and Lefty) share the same behavior, as opposed to having different mechanics.

Noise from the computer and primary ventilation system obscures the sounds of the animatronics' movements. The player may upgrade the office equipment to increase efficiency and reduce the noise level. In addition, the player may switch to a secondary ventilation system that runs more quietly, but is not as effective in controlling the ambient temperature. Any sponsorships accepted will cause loud advertisements to be played randomly on the computer, attracting the animatronics and making the player unable to hear them or do anything for several seconds. The day ends with the daily tasks are done and the computer is logged off.

The main game ends after six days and nights have been completed. Several different endings are possible, depending on factors such as the degree of improvement made to the pizzeria, the number of lawsuits brought against the pizzeria by customers, and whether or not the player salvaged every animatronic.

==Plot==
The player character is a new [[franchisee]] of the re-branded Fazbear Entertainment Inc, with headquarters in [[Washington County, Utah]]. After making an initial investment (a small room, tables &amp; chairs, and electricity), the player is left with $100 to spend on a new restaurant. After the first night, they are encouraged to prepare for their "ultimate test", which is a big party on Saturday. After the day is over, the player is instructed to either complete the maintenance checklist on one of four animatronics of different origin (meeting the criteria under paragraph 4 of their contract) or throw the animatronic back in the alley where they were found being the animatronics stated above. On occasion, the animatronics may already be hiding inside the facility, having been hidden in a previously-purchased low-quality object.

After Saturday, depending on if the player has salvaged all of the animatronics or not, the animatronic Scrap Baby tells the player that they are here to receive a gift and they will do what they are created to do (that is to lure and kill children), making her father proud of her. Cassette Man interrupts her, calling her Elizabeth and telling her that she and the other haunted animatronics are unknowingly trapped in the labyrinth of vents inside of the pizzeria. A cutscene plays, showing that the pizzeria has been set on fire with the animatronics inside; images are shown of the animatronics attempting to escape as they are destroyed by the fire. As it burns, Cassette Man (implied to be Henry from ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes]]'') explains that the player’s attraction was made to lure the animatronics into a trap, and that the souls trapped within them would finally receive peace, with the exception of one, William Afton/Springtrap, who he tells "the darkest pit of [[Hell]] has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the [[Devil]] waiting, old friend." He tells the player (implied to be Michael Afton) that he had planned a way out for him, but he has a feeling that the player would rather not leave. Cassette Man then talks to his daughter (implied to be Charlie from the books) who haunts the Puppet who is heavily implied to be inside of Lefty, apologizing to her for not saving her. The video feed cuts out. Another cutscene is then played, which tells the player that they have completed the work week and earned the certificate of "Completion".

A series of alternate endings may also be achieved. If the player has not salvaged all of the animatronics, receives too many lawsuits, or becomes bankrupt, they will be fired from their job. The player may also obtain an ending where the player is deemed insane after discovering blueprints and secret information in their office following their purchase of the “Egg Baby” animatronic. In the "insanity" ending, Cassette Man reveals that he unwillingly helped William Afton to build the animatronics and his daughter was the first victim of Afton's mass murder.

If the player has discovered the secret endings within the "Fruity Maze", "Midnight Motorist", and "Security Puppet" attractions, a picture of a graveyard will appear at the end of the game, giving the player a certificate of "Lorekeeper" which has six gravestones with the names of Gabriel, Fritz, Susie, and Jeremy on four of them.

==Development==
In June 2017, Cawthon hinted towards the development of a sixth main game in the series, with a teaser on scottgames.com &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=scottgames.com|url=www.scottgames.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing a picture that appeared to be Circus Baby from [[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]], but later announced his decision to cancel the game and instead develop a separate installment similar to ''[[FNaF World]]'' such as a "pizzeria tycoon".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/100500/five-nights-at-freddys-6-announced-then-cancelled-by-creator|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 6 Announced, Then Cancelled by Creator|website=Shacknews|language=en|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teasers for a new game began appearing on Cawthon's website in late 2017. On December 4, 2017, Cawthon released ''Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator'' on Steam as [[freeware]], which fans presumed to be the game he had referred to previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/4/16735950/five-nights-at-freddys-spinoff-freddy-fazbears-pizzeria-simulator-released-steam-scott-cawthon|title=Surprise Five Nights at Freddy’s spinoff hits Steam — and it’s free|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=2017-12-04|website=Polygon|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/freddy-fazbears-pizzeria-simulator-is-out-now/|title=Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator is out now|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Cawthon announced on a Steam post that he would think about gaining help from larger publishers in making future games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.player.one/freddy-fazbear-pizzeria-simulator-update-custom-night-fnaf-6-124232|title=Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria Simulator Update Adds Custom Night To FNaF 6|date=2018-02-21|work=Player.One|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an edited version of the same post, he added that he would be developing an "ultimate custom night” for ''Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria Simulator'', which, as revealed on his website, has about 57 animatronics  from the game and all other games in the ''Five Nights at Freddy’s'' series attacking the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://attackofthefanboy.com/news/freddy-fazbears-pizzeria-simulator-custom-night-roster-revealed/|title=Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator Custom Night Full Roster Revealed|date=2018-02-20|work=Attack of the Fanboy|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom night is due for release on June 29, 2018. However, in an article Scott made on Steam on June 22nd, Scott revealed that he was going to release the game early, on the 22nd, but because he had promised YouTuber Lewis Dawkins (AKA "Dawko") that he would not release it before he came back from vacation, he would wait until June 27th to release the game, the day that Lewis comes back from vacation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://steamcommunity.com/games/871720/announcements/detail/1699428479887914952 Scott Cawthon's promise to Lewis Dawkin], June 22nd 2018 via Steam&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GCstar''' is an [[open-source software|open-source application]] for managing personal collections. Detailed information on each item can be automatically retrieved from the Internet and the user can store additional data, such as the location or whom he has lent them to. The user may also search and filter the collection by criteria.

GCstar is written in Perl and uses [[GTK+]] for its [[GUI widget]]s.

Current version manages these kinds of collections:

* Board games
* Books
* Comic books
* Mini vehicles
* Movies
* Music
* Numismatic
* Periodicals
* Smart cards
* Stamps
* TV show episodes
* User defined collections
* Video games
* Wines

GCstar is the successor to [[GCfilms]], which only managed collections of movies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gcstar.org/about.en.php&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

{{clear}}

== Features ==

=== Automatic retrieval ===
Information concerning an item (from one of the default collection types) can be automatically retrieved from various Internet websites. Only a few pieces of information, such as movie title or [[ISBN]], are required to perform the search.

=== Import and export ===
GCstar supports importing collections created by other programs, such as Alexandria, Ant Movie Catalog, or [[Tellico]].  It can also import lists made in more standard formats, such as [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] or a simple list of items' names.

The collections may also be exported to various formats, including [[HTML]], [[SQL]], or [[XML]].

=== Lending managements ===
Each item in a collection can be marked as loaned to someone. GCstar keeps an history of all borrowers. It can also send an email to the borrower.

== The mascot ==
The GCstar mascot is the same as GCfilms': a blue periscope named '''Péri'''. He was created by LE SPEKTRE.
{{clear}}

== Platforms ==
'''GCstar''' may be used on any system for which [[GTK+|Gtk2]]-[[Perl]] is available. It is included in many [[Linux]] distributions ([[Debian]], [[Fedora Extras]], [[Ubuntu Linux]] Universe, [[Mandriva Linux]] contribs) and [[FreeBSD]]. A version for [[Microsoft Windows]] also exists.

== License ==
'''GCstar''' is released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Images associated with the project, for example '''Péri''', are released under a dual license: [[GNU General Public License]] (to be used in GCstar) and [[Creative Commons]] Attribution ShareAlike License v. 2.5 (to let other designers use it).

==Reviews==
GCstar has received generally favorable ratings across its lifespan.

On April 16, 2007, Mihai Marinof's review of GCstar 1.1.1 at [[Softpedia]] gave the software a "Very Good" rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  Her wrap-up read:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/linux/GCstar-Review-52070.shtml|work=Softpedia|date=April 16, 2007|author= Mihai Marinof|title=GCstar Review|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''The Good''
:''GCstar is a free application for managing personal collections. By default, it can manage movies, video games, books, music or numismatic collections but also allows the user to create a custom collection type. Detailed information on each item can be fetched from Internet websites but also additional information can be manually added by the user. It's quite easy to use and provides a clean interface. It's written in Gtk2-Perl so it's able to run on basically any GNU/Linux system, as well as on MS Windows.''

:''The Bad''
:''Unfortunately, each collection type is saved under a different file, creating a new collection type is very difficult and the items list can't display both the image and text at the same time.''

:''The Truth''
:''GCstar can organize different types of items, for instance movies collections, games, books, music, numismatic or even user defined collections. Unfortunately, creating a new collection is quite difficult. However, it's a pretty good application and you should first give it a try and then decide if you want or don't want to make it a part of your software collection.''

In a December 20, 2010 review of GCstar version 1.6.1, [[CNET]] Editors rated the application 5 out of 5 stars and "Spectacular" (the highest possible ratings), noting: "There are many collection managers to choose from; some free, some easy. GCstar is both. It's one of the best of the type we've seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=GCstar: CNET Editors' Review|work=CNET.com|date=December 20, 2010|url=http://download.cnet.com/GCstar/3000-2131_4-10626830.html|accessdate=June 7, 2012|author=CNET Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ratings accessed on June 7, 2012 at [[Google Play]], the Android-based GCstar Viewer received 4 out of 5 stars from Google Play and 3.9 out of 5 stars from viewers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gcstar.viewer&amp;hl=en|title=GCstar Viewer|accessdate=June 7, 2012|work=Google Play}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly the GCstar Scanner received 4 out of 5 stars from Google Play and 3.8 out of 5 stars from viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gcstar.scanner&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nY3N0YXIuc2Nhbm5lciJd|title=GCstar Scanner|accessdate=June 7, 2012|work=Google Play}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published in issue 164/2014 of [[Linux Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2014/164/GCstar&lt;/ref&gt; the editor Erik Bärwaldt reviewed GCStar, discussing usability and use cases as well as viability.
He concluded:
:''Conclusions''
:''The only shortcoming of the GCstar collection management tool that I noticed was that the software does not let you print out inventory lists, although you can export lists in various file formats. Otherwise, the program leaves little to be desired: It is fast and stable, properly localized, and has a logical superstructure, including meaningful categories. In particular, Linux users who have several different hobbies will definitely learn to appreciate GCstar, thanks to the numerous templates for various collection types.''

== [[Geert Hofstede]] ==

Hofstede has performed research for several decades that continues to impact research in global and international arenas of global leadership.  Hofstede’s research is primarily focused on how values in the workplace are influenced by culture. According to him, all behaviors are determined by culture. In his definition; culture is ‘the collective programming of the mind distinguishing the members of one group or category of people from others.’ To conduct his research, he analyzed a large database of employee value scores collected within IBM between years 1967 and 1973. There is over 70 countries in the data. Hofstede’s primary tenants of culture differentiation are summed up through his research more elaborately, but primarily consist of:&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G., &amp; Hofstede, G. J. (1967-2009). itim international Retrieved November 3, 2010, from http://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt; In his model, he identified six dimensions of national culture based on his research. Those dimensions are also used to differentiate countries from each other, based on how countries score on the six dimensions. The scale of scores range from 0 – 100. If a score is below 50 it is considered as Low and if it is higher than 50 it is considered as High in that dimension. Here, although countries are represented with a score, the scores are relative and cannot represent unique individuals. In other words, ‘culture can be only used meaningfully by comparison.’ The relevant scores are proven to be stable over time. Forces that cause cultures to shift are global and therefore is there is something effecting the culture in a country, it actually effects many countries at the same time in the world. The model consists of six dimensions; which are Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity vs Femininity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long Term Orientation vs Short Term Normative Orientation and Indulgence vs Restraint. Furthermore, he has published several books and academic articles on the subject in order to light the way for global business leaders as well as academic researchers.

=== Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
* '''Power Distance Index (PDI)-''' that is an index which measures the less powerful members of organizations and institutions and how they accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. Power distance indicates how society handles inequalities among people. Countries that have high power distance accept the hierarchical order in which people are in different levels / places and there is no further justification. Therefore, inequalities of power and wealth distribution are allowed in the society. On the other hand, countries having low power distance are supported equality and demand justification for inequalities of power. In these societies, equality and opportunity for everyone is highly reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Individualism (ADV)-''' as it is juxtaposed to its opposite, collectivism, that is the measure to which individuals are comfortably integrated into groups. The society’s point of view on this dimension is reflected in whether people’s self-image is defined in terms of ‘I’ or ‘We’. Or similarly, it is the difference between individual above the society vs society above the individual. In individualistic countries there is high valuation of people’s time, their need for independence and their privacy. On the other hand, collectivist countries are more supportive for harmony in the society.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Femininity (FEM)-''' versus its opposite, masculinity, refers to the distribution of roles between the genders which is another fundamental issue for any society to which a range of solutions are found. Femininity represents cooperation, modesty, caring for the weak, and quality of life. Masculinity represents competitiveness, achievements, heroism, assertiveness and material rewards for success. In the business world, femininity and masculinity is seen as being "tender or tough."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hofstede-insights.com/models/national-culture/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI)-''' deals with a society's tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity; it ultimately refers to man's search for Truth. Countries having high uncertainty avoidance have very strict rules of belief and behavior and they are intolerant for ideas or behavior otherwise. Countries having low uncertainty avoidance have more relaxed attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Long-Term Orientation (LTO)-''' values associated with Long Term Orientation are thrift and perseverance; values associated with Short Term Orientation are respect for tradition, fulfilling social obligations, and protecting one's 'face'. This dimension is created to understand the long term orientation of mainly Asian cultures and their respect for tradition. In the business world, long-term orientation and shot term orientation are referred as being pragmatic and normative.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Indulgence (IVR)-''' versus restraint refers to the extent to which members of a society try to control their desires and impulses. Whereas indulgent societies have a tendency to allow relatively free gratification of basic and natural human desires related to enjoying life and having fun, restrained societies have a conviction that such gratification needs to be curbed and regulated by strict norms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geert-hofstede.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project GLOBE ==

The GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness Research) project took Hofstede’s original 1980 research findings (Hofstede, 1980) and dedicated an entire academic effort into exploring the differences of cultures (Hofstede, 1980). “Conceived in 1991 by Robert J. House of the [[Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and led by Professor House, the GLOBE Project directly involved 170 “country co-investigators” based in 62 of the world’s [[cultures]] as well as a 14-member group of coordinators and research associates. This international team collected data from 17,300 [[middle manager]]s in 951 organizations. They used qualitative methods to assist their development of quantitative [[Survey methodology|instruments]].&lt;ref&gt;Grove, C. (2005). Introduction to the GLOBE Research Project on Leadership Worldwide from http://www.grovewell.com/pub-GLOBE-intro.html&lt;/ref&gt;”  The research identified nine cultural competencies and grouped the 62 countries into ten [[convenient]] societal clusters (Javidan &amp; Dastmalchian, 2009).

=== Globe cultural clusters ===

The GLOBE researchers used acquired data to put nations into cultural clusters that are grouped based upon cultural similarities due to shared geography and climate conditions, which all influence perceptions and behavior:

'''Anglo Cultures'''
[[England]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]] (white sample), [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Ireland]], [[United States]]

'''Arab Cultures'''
[[Algeria]], [[Qatar]], [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Yemen]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[UAE]], [[Bahrain]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Oman]]

'''Confucian Asia'''
[[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]]

'''Eastern Europe'''
[[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Serbia]], [[Greece]], [[Slovenia]], [[Albania]], [[Russia]]

'''Germanic Europe'''
''Dutch-speaking'' ([[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[French Flanders|Dutch-speaking France]])
''German-speaking'' ([[Austria]], German-speaking [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[South Tyrol]], [[Liechtenstein]])

'''Latin America'''
[[Costa Rica]], [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]]

'''Latin Europe'''
[[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]] (French and Italian speaking)

'''Nordic Europe'''
[[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]]

'''Southern Asia'''
[[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Iran]], [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]]

'''Sub-Sahara Africa'''
[[Namibia]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[South Africa]] (Black Sample), [[Nigeria]]

=== GLOBE cultural competencies ===
The nine GLOBE cultural competencies are:
# '''Performance [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]] -''' refers to the extent to which an organization or [[society]] encourages and rewards group members for [[performance improvement]] and excellence.
# '''Assertiveness orientation -''' is the degree to which individuals in organizations or societies are assertive, confrontational, and aggressive in social relationships.
# '''Future orientation -''' is the degree to which individuals in [[organizations]] or societies engage in future-oriented behaviors such as planning, investing in the future, and delaying [[gratification]].
# '''Humane orientation -''' is the degree to which individuals in organizations or societies encourage and reward individuals for being fair, [[altruistic]], friendly, generous, caring, and kind to others.
# '''[[Collectivism]] I:  Institutional collectivism -''' reflects the degree to which organizational and societal institutional practices encourage and reward collective distribution of resources and collective action.
# '''[[Collectivism]] II: In-group collectivism -''' reflects the degree to which individuals express pride, loyalty and cohesiveness in their organizations or families.
# '''[[Gender]] [[egalitarianism]] -''' is the extent to which an organization or a [[society]] minimizes gender role differences and gender discrimination.
# '''Power distance -''' is defined as the degree to which members of an organization or society expect and agree that power should be unequally shared.
# '''Uncertainty avoidance -''' is defined as the extent to which members of an organization or society strive to avoid uncertainty by reliance on social norms, [[rituals]], and [[bureaucratic]] practices to alleviate the [[unpredictability]] of future events.

After extensive review of the research the GLOBE strategically grouped over 21 primary leadership [[dimensions]] into six encompassing dimensions of global leadership and made recommendation about how the dimensions of culture and leadership could distinguish influences of one country from another.

=== Culturally endorsed implicit leadership (CLT) ===
The six Globe dimensions of culturally endorsed implicit leadership (CLT) are:
# '''Charismatic/value based –''' characterized by demonstrating integrity, decisiveness, and performance oriented by appearing visionary, inspirational and self-sacrificing, but can also be toxic and allow for autocratic commanding.
# '''Team oriented –''' characterized by [[diplomacy|diplomatic]], administratively competent, team collaboration and integration.  A [[Toxic leader|Toxic]] leader would be malevolent alienating the team, but driving cohesion
# '''Self-protective –''' characterized by self-centered, face saving, procedural behavior capable of inducing conflict when necessary while being conscious of status
# '''Participative –''' characterized by (non-autocratic) participative behavior that is supportive of those who are being led
# '''Human orientation –''' characterized by modesty and compassion for others in an altruistic fashion
# '''Autonomous –''' being able to function without constant consultation

As [[globalization]] continues to thrive and change, the concept of global leadership will adapt to serve the best interest of a world being made incrementally smaller.

'''IBAT College Dublin''' is a private [[for-profit education|for-profit]] higher education institution located in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland]].  It was founded in 2004 as the '''Institute of Business and Technology'''. From 2009 to 2011 it was known as '''IBAT College Swords'''. As of 2018, the college offers two part-time Bachelor of Arts degrees and an [[MBA]], all of which are validated by the [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]]. It also offers English-language courses and its own short courses in various subjects related to business and technology.

==History==
The college was founded in 2004 by Shane Ormsby who was its director and principal shareholder. Originally called the Institute of Business and Technology, its first campus was on Forster Way in the [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]] area of north Dublin. In 2006, it received programme validation from the [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]] (HETAC). By 2011, it was offering the Certificate in Business, Higher Certificate in Business, Bachelor of Business, and Bachelor of Business (Honours). In addition to those HETAC validated programmes, it also offered an [[MBA]] validated by the [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]] and various accountancy, business, and technology training programmes which at the time were approved by [[Accounting Technicians Ireland|ATI]], [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]], [[Irish Computer Society|ICS]] and [[Institute of Commercial Management|ICM]].&lt;ref name="HETAC"&gt;[[HETAC]] (2012). [https://www.qqi.ie/Publications/Publications/IBAT%20College%20Dublin,%20Institutional%20Review%20-%20April%202012,%20Terms%20of%20Reference.pdf ''Institutional Review of IBAT College Dublin'']. Retrieved 27 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "QQI"&gt;[[Quality and Qualifications Ireland]] (January 2017).

Retrieved 27 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The College had changed its name from the Institute of Business and Technology to IBAT College Swords in July 2009. It was changed again in July 2011 to its present name, IBAT College Dublin. The 2011 name change reflected IBAT's move to a new purpose-built main campus in the center of Dublin at [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]].&lt;ref name="HETAC" /&gt; In 2014 the college entered into an agreement with [[Global University Systems]] (GUS) which involved GUS assisting IBAT with student recruitment and marketing. The GUS subsidiary Interactive would also digitise the learning materials for the college's ACCA accountancy courses. At that time Ormsby said that there had been no discussions about the company taking a financial stake in his business.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Tom (23 December 2014).

''[[The Irish Times]]''. Retrieved 27 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the outset, the college has catered mainly to students from outside Ireland, the majority of whom are also from outside the [[European Economic Area]]. Concerns about the college's acceptance of students without the requisite level of English for higher education study, poor student progression and retention rates, and lax admissions procedures and record-keeping led to a review by [[Quality and Qualifications Ireland]] (QQI) which was completed in January 2017. At the conclusion of the review, validation was removed from all of the college's HETAC business programmes. Despite the withdrawal of accreditation for its HETAC business courses, IBAT was still allowed to recruit non-EU students on visas for its English-language courses. Its MBA validated by the University of Wales remained unaffected.&lt;ref name= "QQI" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="ST"&gt;Tighe, Mark (15 October 2017), [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/college-gets-marked-down-bb0nr3hrk "College gets marked down"].

Retrieved 27 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In November 2016, as the QQI review was taking place, IBAT Dublin was sold to Global University Systems. Shane Ormsby remained the college's director after the takeover.&lt;ref name ="ST" /&gt;

==Academic programmes==
As of 2018, IBAT Dublin offers two part-time Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degrees in Sports Management and Development and in International Business. It also offers an [[MBA]] which can be studied full- or part-time. All three degrees are validated by the [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]]. In addition to the degree programes, IBAT offers English-language courses and its own short courses in various subjects related to business and technology.&lt;ref&gt;IBAT College Dublin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24303">The '''International Chemistry Olympiad''' ('''IChO''') is an annual academic competition for high school students. It is one of the [[International Science Olympiad]]s.

The first IChO was held in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1968. The event has been held every year since then, with the exception of 1971. The delegations that attended the first events were mostly countries of the former [[Eastern bloc]] and it was not until 1980, the 12th annual International Chemistry Olympiad, that the event was held outside of the bloc in [[Austria]].  Up to 4 students for each national team compete around July in both a theoretical and an experimental sections, with about half of the participants being awarded medals.

==Structure and rules==   
[[File:IChO medal.jpg|thumb|An International Chemistry Olympiad medal for 29th IChO, held at [[Montreal]], [[Canada]].]]

Each delegation consists of up to four students and two mentors (one of them is designated as the head of the delegation or "head mentor"). A delegation may also include a handful of guests and scientific observers. Students must be under the age of 20 and must not be enrolled as regular students in any post-secondary education institution. The International Information Center of the International Chemistry Olympiad is based in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]].

Countries who wish to participate in the IChO must send observers to two consecutive olympiads before their students can participate in the event. A total of 68 countries took part in the 38th IChO in 2006: 67 as participants and 1 as an observer. In 2017 more than 80 countries are expected to send students.

The competition consists of two examinations, a theoretical examination and a practical examination. Both have durations of up to 5 hours, and are held on separate days with the practical examination usually being before the theoretical examination. The theoretical examination has a value of 60 points and the practical examination has a value of 40 points. Each examination is evaluated independently from the other and the sum of the results of the examinations determines a participant's overall result. A scientific jury, which is installed by the host country, suggests the tasks. The international jury, which consists of the 2 mentors from each of the participating countries, discusses the competition tasks and translates them into the language of their students' preference.

Students receive the examinations translated into their languages of preference. It is the duty of the mentors to translate the examinations from English before they are given to the participants. After the examinations are held and evaluated by a committee appointed by the host country and before awards are presented, mentors discuss the evaluation of the exams with judges of the committee to assure fairness in their evaluation. Because the mentors review the examinations before they are given to participants, any communication between the mentors and the students is strictly forbidden prior to the completion of both exams, and the students are required to surrender any mobile phones and laptop computers to the organizer.

The syllabus of the competition contains subjects from several areas of [[chemistry]], including [[organic chemistry]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[spectroscopy]]. Though some of these subjects are included in most secondary school chemistry programs, for the most part, they are evaluated at a much deeper level and many may require a level of knowledge and understanding comparable to that of post-secondary education. In addition, the host country of each IChO issues a set of preparatory problems well in advance of the competition every year. These preparatory problems cover specific topics in considerable more depth than typical post-secondary education. Preparation for the International Chemistry Olympiad demands a high level of understanding and interest in chemistry and an outstanding ability to relate chemical subjects with one another as well as with the practical world.

[[File:Medali Emas Kelvin.jpg|thumb|A gold medal from the 40th IChO]]
All participants are ranked based on their individual scores and no official team scores are given. Gold medals are awarded to approximately the top 10% of students, silver medals are awarded to approximately the next 20% of students, and bronze medals are awarded approximately to the next 30% of students. The exact number of medals is decided on the blind review of the results. Honorable mentions are awarded to the next top 10% of the participants that do not win a medal. One special award is given to the student that achieves the highest score overall.  Two separate special awards are given to the students who get the best score in the theoretical and practical examinations.

These events are also outstanding opportunities for the students to meet people from all around the world who share similar interests, to visit different places, and to get in touch with different cultures. As the aims of the competition establish, ''the IChO competitions help to enhance friendly relations among young people from different countries; they encourage cooperation and international understanding''.

==Preparation==
While each country is free to choose its team by whatever means it seems appropriate, the selection process usually involves holding regional and national olympiad competitions. Many countries hold "training camps" for its top students, where mentors from the country give the students accelerated college-level courses in chemistry with an emphasis on the topics covered in that year's preparatory problems as well as practical training. It is agreed that such training programs must not exceed a total duration of two weeks but there are allegations every year that some countries exceed this limit by months or even years. Another concern is that some countries tend to bring the same students to the competition year after year, which helps them win better medals. Although some believe that this is against the spirit of the olympiad, many nations find it hard to justify leaving their best students at home.

==History==
The idea of the International Chemistry Olympiad was developed in the former Czechoslovakia in 1968. It was designed with the aim to increase the number of international contacts and the exchange of information between nations. Invitations were sent by the Czechoslovak national committee to all [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, except Romania (due to political issues between Romania and USSR). However, in May 1968, relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union became so delicate that only Poland and Hungary participated in the first international competition.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icho39.chem.msu.ru/html/english/IChO/History.htm |title=39th INTERNATIONAL CHEMISTRY OLYMPIAD |publisher=Icho39.chem.msu.ru |date= |accessdate=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first International Chemistry Olympiad took place in Prague between 18 and 21 June 1968. Each of the three participating countries sent a team of six students, and four theoretical tasks were to be solved. Guidelines for the next competitions were already suggested. The second chemistry Olympiad took place in 1969 in Poland, and Bulgaria also participated, with USSR and GDR only sending observers. Each team consisted of five pupils, and an experimental competition was added. The decision was made to invite more socialist countries to future competitions and to limit the number of pupils to four. The third Olympiad in 1970 was organized in Hungary with the GDR, Romania and the Soviet Union as new countries. In this competition, more than three prizes were distributed for the first time.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

There was no Olympiad held in 1971, as at the end of the competition in 1970, an organizer and host for the next event could not be agreed on. This was solved for the next three years by diplomatically agreeing on the Soviet Union to host 1972, Bulgaria in 1973, and Romania in 1974, starting the tradition to decide the host years in advance.. 1972 was the first time where preparation tasks for the International Chemistry Olympiad were created. Also, at a jury session, it was suggested that invitations should be sent to Vietnam, Mongolia, and Cuba. Unfortunately though, these invitations were not sent, leaving seven to compete in 1973.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In 1974, Romania invited Sweden and Yugoslavia to the Olympiad in Bucharest and Germany and Austria sent observers. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first NATO-country with an observer present and this was only able to occur because the Brandt government had contracts in the East. Thus, in 1975, West Germany, Austria, and Belgium also participated in the International Chemistry Olympiad.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The first Olympiad in a non-socialist country took place 1980 in Linz in Austria, although the Soviet Union did not participate. Since then the number of the participating countries has increased steadily. In 1980, only 13 nations took part but this number increased to 21 by the 1984 Olympiad in Frankfurt/Main. With [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] and the break-up of the Soviet Union into independent states in the early 1990s, the number of participants increased again. In addition, the increasing interest of Asian and Latin American countries became apparent with the numbers of participants. Altogether 47 delegations participated in 1998.  Presently, 75 countries participate in the International Chemistry Olympiad.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

'''Jay W. Jensen''' (August 4, 1931 – February 17, 2007) was a Miami Beach, Florida, drama teacher&lt;ref name="www6.miami.edu"&gt;http://www6.miami.edu/campaign/donors/donors_dp_jensen.html&lt;/ref&gt; known as "The Teacher to the Stars". Jensen is credited with inspiring the acting talents of such well-known actors as [[Andy García]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000412/bio&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mickey Rourke]].&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000620/bio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Human:29155&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early years===
[[Image:Jensen-dance.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Jay W. Jensen dance routine 1952]]
Jensen was born in [[Irvington, New Jersey]]. He was the only child of John W. and Thelma "Billie" Jensen. His father was a musician in a nightclub band, and his mother was a nightclub manager. As a child, he developed a love of film and drama. During his school years, he studied ballroom dancing and acting. In 1950, his family moved to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], where he earned an Associate of Arts degree from [[St. Petersburg College]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.new-theatre.org/jensen.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Jensen moved to Miami, where he graduated from the [[University of Miami]] with a BA in Education.&lt;ref name="www6.miami.edu"/&gt; In 1953, he left Florida to live and study in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. While in Cuba, Jensen studied at the [[University of Havana]]. Upon his return to Miami in 1954, he began teaching at Little River Junior High School.

After teaching for three years, Jensen decided to accomplish his dream of being a motion picture actor and "go to [[Hollywood]] and get discovered." Along with his widowed mother, Thelma, and his cat Dracula, he flew to [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="nl.newsbank.com"&gt;http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_multi=MH|&amp;p_product=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_site=miami&amp;s_trackval=MH&amp;s_search_type=keyword&amp;s_dispstring=jay%20w.%20jensen%20AND%20date(all)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(jay%20w.%20jensen)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=_rank_:D&amp;xcal_ranksort=4&amp;xcal_useweights=yes&amp;s_trackval=&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hollywood===

In California, Jensen traveled to Los Angeles for an interview with movie producer [[Joe Pasternak]]. Pasternak told Jensen he was leaving the motion picture business, and Jensen's dreams of a movie career were dashed. However, while in Hollywood, Jensen became friends with actress [[Carroll Baker]]. He became Baker's dance partner, and appeared as an extra in three of her movies: ''[[The Big Country]]'', ''[[But Not for Me (1959 film)|But Not for Me]]'', and ''[[The Miracle (1959 film)|The Miracle]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1913148/&lt;/ref&gt; Baker and Jensen performed a dance routine for the troops at [[MacDill Air Force Base]] in [[Tampa, Florida]].&lt;ref name="education.miami.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.miami.edu/News/pdfs/jayjensen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921222854/http://www.education.miami.edu/News/pdfs/jayjensen.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jensen's circle of friends included actors [[Jim Backus]] and [[Hurd Hatfield]]. After a failed interview with DesiLu Productions, Jensen decided to return to Florida. It was also during the 1950s that he became a close friend of the writer and playwright [[Tennessee Williams]].

==South Florida==

In 1959, Jensen was rehired by Miami-Dade County Public Schools, and began a 32-year career as a drama teacher at [[Miami Beach Senior High School]]. However, he didn't give up on his motion picture career. He co-starred in ''Rehearsal For Sin'', an independent film produced in South Florida, and played a few uncredited roles in such movies as ''Racing Fever'' and ''[[Werewolves on Wheels]]''. &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Jensen went on to earn a Master of Education Degree in Administration, Curriculum and Drama Education from the University of Miami. At Miami Beach High, he directed 300 plays and musicals. His productions of the plays ''You Can't Take It With You'', ''The Fantastics'', ''[[David and Lisa]]'', ''[[The Great White Hope]]'', ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]'', ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', ''[[The Impossible Years]]'', ''[[To Kill A Mockingbird#Play|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and ''[[Viet Rock]]'', were groundbreaking and controversial for the times.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

''The Serpent'' was a play of Biblical proportions; performed with a begetting scene.&lt;ref&gt;Miami Beach Senior High School Slumni Directory 2003, page VI&lt;/ref&gt; One of the student-actors in the cast was future movie star [[Mickey Rourke]].&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt; Among his numerous other students were movie actors [[Andy García]],&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05EEDA173AF930A15751C0A9619C8B63&lt;/ref&gt; Neal Gold,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0325053/bio&lt;/ref&gt; actor/voice actor [[Jerry Gelb]].;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Gelb]]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Annabelle Gurwitch]]; movie directors [[Brett Ratner]]&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; and Sara Sackner; rapper [[Luther Campbell]]; sportscaster [[Roy Firestone]];, executive producer Heather Winters, music composer [[Desmond Child]]; casting director Debra Zane; and artist [[Romero Britto]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1870022/bio&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen also worked with supermodel [[Niki Taylor]] and coached Jennifer Fox in Gypsy.

In the early 1990s, Jensen retired from teaching full-time but continued to work as an instructor for Adult and Community Education for Miami-Dade County Public Schools. His co-faculty members at Fienberg-Fisher Adult and Community Education Center included fellow actors Steven Brack, Lois Brooks, William Conroy, and Carl Starling.

On November 6, 1999, Jensen was inducted into the [[Miami Beach Senior High School]] Hall of Fame by the Miami Beach Senior High School Alumni Association.&lt;ref name="nl.newsbank.com"/&gt;

===Mexican cinema===
[[Image:Jensen-actor.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Jay W. Jensen(left) in the 1965 Mexican film, El Gangster]]

Jensen was also involved in Mexican cinema and considered Mexico City his second home. He spoke Spanish and worked as an actor and casting director. Jensen acted in five Mexican-produced films from 1965 to 1970, working with directors such as Luis Alcoriza and Albert Zugsmith on the movies&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ''El Gangster'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180727/fullcredits#cast&lt;/ref&gt; ''Los Cuatro Juanes'', ''Paraiso'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064788/fullcredits#cast&lt;/ref&gt; ''El Pistolero Fantasma'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368139/fullcredits#cast&lt;/ref&gt; and ''La Captura de Gabino Barrera''.

In 2001, Jensen was the casting director for the Mexican production of ''I Never Saw Another Butterfly''.

Jensen also served as drama consultant in Mexico City with the Peterson Schools.

===Tennessee Williams===

Jensen became friends with writer-playwright [[Tennessee Williams]] in the 1950s. They met at the old Robert Clay Hotel in [[South Beach]]&lt;ref name="education.miami.edu"/&gt; and remained friends until Williams's death.

[[Image:Tennessee Williams NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Jensen and Tennessee Williams were friends from 1959 until Williams death in 1983.]]

In his spare time. Jensen lectured at colleges, book fairs, and festivals about his relationship with Williams. He entitled his lecture, "The Other Side of Tennessee Williams".&lt;ref name="actorsplayhouse.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actorsplayhouse.org/news_jensen.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720012007/http://www.actorsplayhouse.org/news_jensen.htm |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a featured speaker at the Tennessee Williams Literary Fest in [[New Orleans]] in 1998, and appeared also at the Tennessee Williams Festival in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/south/register/winter04/nineteen.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===

Jensen was an only child. His father, John W. Jensen, died in the 1950s. His mother, Thelma aka Billie, died in January 1999 at the age of 93.

Jensen never married, but in the 1970s, he was engaged to transsexual dancer Jennifer Fox.&lt;ref name="education.miami.edu"/&gt; The two announced their engagement on ''The Joey Carr Show'', a local South Florida television program. Years later, Fox was interviewed in ''Class Act'', a documentary on Jensen's life.

===Final years===

Jensen received numerous awards during his life. He served as a regional director for the National Thespian Society, hosted conferences before the Florida State Thespian Festival, and was a Carbonell voter{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in South Florida.

Jensen donated over $4 million to such institutions as the University of Miami's Theater Arts Department, the School of Education,&lt;ref&gt;http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/fall98/philanthropy.html&lt;/ref&gt; the Lowe Art Museum, the Ring Theater, and the Peterson Schools in Mexico.

He gave $100,000 to the Actor's Playhouse in Miami. The Mainstage Auditorium Stage was dedicated in honor of Jensen and his parents.&lt;ref name="actorsplayhouse.org"/&gt;

In 1997, he and his mother Thelma bequeathed $1 million to the Lowe Art Museum in Miami, Florida for a pre-Columbian wing named in honor of his 92-year-old mother.&lt;ref name="www6.miami.edu"/&gt; He donated another million dollars to the Jerry Herman Ring Theater.

In the July 29, 2002, issue of ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'', Jensen was profiled along with other retirees regarding a meltdown in the stock market and eroding pension benefits. "I'm incensed," said Jensen of the scandals rocking the stock market. "Everytime I look I'm getting poorer." However, Jensen told the magazine that regardless of his losses, he still had a positive outlook on life: "My theory is, you die if you don't keep moving."

===Death===

In July 2006, Jensen discovered he had [[prostate cancer]]. Though seriously ill, he continued to work. He appeared numerous times in fundraising appeals for [[PBS]] television. However, his illness quickly progressed, and he died on Saturday, February 17, 2007, in [[Coral Gables, Florida]].&lt;ref name="nl.newsbank.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="education.miami.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

Martin Carnoy received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[California Institute of Technology]] (1960) and a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] from the [[University of Chicago]] (1961 and 1964.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/people/Martin_Carnoy|title=FSI {{!}} CDDRL - Martin Carnoy|website=cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research==

Dr. Carnoy is a labor economist with a special interest in the relation between the economy and the educational system. To this end, he studies the US labor market, including the role in that relation of race, ethnicity, and gender, the US educational system, and systems in many other countries. He uses comparative analysis to understand international comparative education, the [[economics of education]] and [[econometrics|applied econometrics]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://lemanncenter.stanford.edu/people/martin-carnoy Profile of Martin Carnoy on the website of the Lemann Center. Retrieved April 1, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; with a focus on the [[political economy]] of education. 

Through his research, Carnoy has argued that educational policy is used by capitalist nations' "bourgeois elites" as a form of [[cultural imperialism]] in order to perpetuate the conditions allowing for the exploitation of working classes both within and without these nations through e.g. education systems that support inherited advantages (''Education as Cultural Imperialism,'' 1974). &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1152953 Bowman, M.J. (1976). Review of ''Education as Cultural Imperialism''. ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'', 24(4), pp. 833-841.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1187772?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Koehl, R. (1975). Review: Cultural Imperialism as Education: An Indictment.

Review of ''Education as Cultural Imperialism'' by Martin Carnoy. ''The School Review'', 84(1), pp. 147-151.]&lt;/ref&gt; He has chronicled how [[Marxism|Marxist]] views on the role of the state shifted considerably throughout the 20th century, sometimes bearing little loyalty to the original views of [[Karl Marx]] (''The State and Political Theory,'' 1984).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/228401 Ikenberry, G.J. (1986). Review of ''The State and Political Theory'' by Martin Carnoy. ''American Journal of Sociology'', 91(6), pp. 1246-1247.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Carnoy also has explored how Cuba leverages small, personalized schools, highly trained teachers, strong principals, a coherent curriculum and long-term relationships between teachers and students to academically outperform most other [[Latin America]]n countries (''Cuba's Academic Advantage, 2007)''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=11035 Carnoy, M. (2007). ''Cuba's Academic Advantage: Why Students in Cuba Do Better in School''. Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/597316 Lutjens, S.L. (2009). Review of ''Cuba's Academic Advantage'' by Martin Carnoy. ''Comparative Education Review'', 53(1), pp. 147-149.]&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Luis Beneviste]] and [[Richard Rothstein]], Carnoy has weighed in on the debate between private and public education, arguing that many private schools in inner cities face the same problems as their neighboring public schools and thus questioning the extent to which they can be part of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.routledge.com/All-Else-Equal-Are-Public-and-Private-Schools-Different/Benveniste-Carnoy-Rothstein/p/book/9780415931977 Beneviste, L., Carnoy, M., Rothstein, R. (2003). ''All Else Equal: Are Public and Private Schools Different?'' New York: Routledge.]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Carnoy, Rothstein, [[Lawrence Mishel]] and [[Rebecca Jacobsen]] have contributed to the debate on [[charter school]]s through their book ''The Charter School Dust-Up'', wherein they compare student enrollment and achievement in charter and public schools and explain the finding that students in the later tend on average to academically outperform students in the former.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epi.org/publication/book_charter_school/ Carnoy, M., Jacobsen, R., Mishel, L., Rothstein, R. (2005). ''The Charter School Dust-Up''. Washington, DC: Economic Policy Institute.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnoy has conducted research on the impact of school accountability on learning, the effectiveness and efficiency of private schools, the impact of [[globalization]] on education systems,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/324053?journalCode=cer Carnoy, M., Rhoten, D. (2002). What Does Globalization Mean for Educational Change? A Comparative Approach. ''Comparative Education Review'', 46(1), pp. 1-9.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[school voucher]]s, flexible work,&lt;ref&gt;Carnoy, M., Castells, M., Benner, C. (1997). Labour markets and employment practices in the age of flexibility: A case study of Silicon Valley. ''International Labour Review'', 136(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  and the impact of [[structural adjustment]] on education.&lt;ref&gt;Carnoy, M. (1995). Structural adjustment and the changing face of education. ''International Labour Review'', 134(6).&lt;/ref&gt; Key findings of Carnoy's research include:

* Students in [[U.S. state]]s with high school accountability averaged significantly higher gains on the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] 8th-grade math tests compared to students in states with little or no school accountability, though there is no significant effect on student retention or high school completion rates (with [[Susanna Loeb]]).&lt;ref&gt;Carnoy, M., Loeb, S. (2002). Does External Accountability Affect Student Outcomes? A Cross-State Analysis. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 24(4), pp. 305-331.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Chile]], Catholic private schools are more effective with regard to education provision than public schools and non-religious private schools, whereas the relationship is reversed with regard to efficiency (with Patrick J. McEwan).&lt;ref&gt;McEwan, P.J., Carnoy, M. (2000). The Effectiveness and Efficiency of Private Schols in Chile's Voucher System. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'', 22(3), pp. 213-239.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The effectiveness of the implementation of school voucher systems, e.g. in [[Sweden]] and Chile, in terms of improving learning outcomes depends critically on the socioeconomic characteristics of their beneficiaries; importantly, its impact on public education is mediated through the expectations and regard a society has for public education (e.g. high in Sweden and low in Chile).&lt;ref&gt;Carnoy, M. (1998). National Voucher Plans in Chile and Sweden: Did Privatization Reforms Make for Better Education? ''Comparative Education Review'', 42(3), pp. 309-337.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Fredric Roizen''' (born January 7, 1946) is an [[Americans|American]] [[anesthesiologist]] and [[internist]], an award-winning author and the chief [[Quality of life|wellness]] officer at the [[Cleveland Clinic]]. Roizen became famous for developing the [[RealAge]] concept and has authored or coauthored five number one New York Times best sellers.

Roizen completed a tour of duty in the [[USPHS|Public Health Service]] and has 165 peer reviewed publications and 100 medical chapters, 14 US patents, started six companies, served on [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) advisory committees for 16 years, and chaired an FDA advisory committee. He also co-invented a drug, [[methylnaltrexone]] (MTNX, trade name Relistor), and took it through phase 2 trials. In May 2008, methylnaltrexone received FDA approval for marketing in the United States.

He has been praised{{hsp}}{{by whom|date=September 2016}} for encouraging Americans to exercise and live healthier lives – and has been an outspoken critic of politicians who use health funds for other purposes — particularly for taking tobacco settlement money and using it for unintended purposes. Besides advocating for a healthier lifestyle today, Roizen has speculated that by 2023 one of the 14 areas of aging might have a breakthrough that will allow people to live until 160 with the same quality of life as at age 45. This speculation has been met with both criticism as well as agreement.

Roizen has also been criticized for what has been called his wild exaggerations about the potential payoffs of exercise and healthy eating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/medical/index.ssf/2008/05/does_roizens_vision_of_longevi.html Is Roizen's vision of longevity bad for the Cleveland Clinic?] May 13, 2008, Chris Seper, The Plain Dealer (includes audio)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
After attending the [[Nichols School]], he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Williams College]] in 1967 with a double major in [[Chemistry]] and [[Economics]].  Subsequently, he attended the [[University of California, San Francisco]] School of Medicine. His residency was at [[Harvard University|Harvard's]] [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]]. After 9 years on the faculty at the University of California, San Francisco, he was the chair of the Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care and Pain Management at the [[University of Chicago]] for 16 years. He then became dean of the School of Medicine and vice president for Biomedical Sciences at [[SUNY Upstate]].

He co-founded [[RealAge]], a service providing personal health tools to consumers. In 2004 and was named chief wellness officer and chair of the Wellness Institute in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-roizen-md |title= Michael Roizen, M.D. | publisher=huffingtonpost.com | accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roizen still practices anesthesiology and internal medicine. He has served on the boards of five non-profit foundations.

Roizen and his wife, Nancy, a developmental [[pediatrician]], live in Cleveland, Ohio. The Roizens have two children.

==Media appearances==
He has appeared on various television shows and featured in various magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realage.com/company_info/roizen_bio.aspx About Michael F. Roizen MD], RealAge.com&lt;/ref&gt; and biography.  He and Dr. Oz coauthor a daily newspaper column in a number of newspapers.

==Real Age==
{{main|RealAge}}
The idea for [[RealAge]] started in 1985 when Roizen convinced a 47-year-old entrepreneur to take his blood-pressure medication by explaining he was living with the body of a 52-year-old by not doing so. The entrepreneur paid for Roizen to assemble a five-person research team and identify controllable factors that affect length and/or quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=E73ABD6180B44874871A91F6BA5C249C&amp;nm=Arts+%26+Entertainemnt&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=1578600D80804596A222593669321019&amp;tier=4&amp;id=9CBB42D6B3B446F884780649E5411EE1 Best Doctors - The Celebrity] March 2008, Lynne Thompson, Cleveland Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

The first RealAge test debuted online in 1998.

The '''National Energy Education Development Project''' is dedicated to promoting an energy conscious and educated society by creating effective networks of students, educators, business, government and community leaders to design and deliver objective, multi-sided energy education programs. 
The NEED Project's educator network includes over 65,000 classrooms nationwide who use NEED's annually up-dated curriculum materials.

==The NEED Project Beginnings==
Started in 1980, launched by a Congressional resolution spearheaded by Gerard Katz, a New York state physics teacher, the '''National Energy Education Development Project''' ('''NEED''') is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit education association dedicated to promoting a realistic understanding of the scientific, economic, and environmental impacts of energy so that students and teachers can make educated decisions.

On March 20, 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed Proclamation 4738, entitled "National Energy Education Day: By the President of the United States, A Proclamation."
The proclamation read, in part:

{{quote|There are only two ways that we can reduce the imports of oil from foreign countries. One is to increase production of American energy of all kinds—and we have been blessed with tremendous reserves compared to other nations—and the other is to conserve the energy supplies that we have from all sources. We have made some progress. It has not yet been adequate, but it's been steady. We've more than reduced imports by a million barrels a day—and we expect to make even greater progress this year—since I've been in office, in 1977.

One of the major opportunities that has not yet been explored is to educate our young people—who can be just as effective, perhaps even more so, than many adults—in the facts about energy, what the opportunities are for conservation, and how they themselves can help. In homes, on the job, in transportation—there is a tremendous opportunity not only for young people to learn but also to educate their parents about the facts concerning how we can solve our energy problem through conservation.

A recent analysis has shown that there is an abysmal lack of information within the public school system among the students about basic facts concerning energy. And this designation of a national day for energy education is a very worthwhile commitment because of the facts that I've just described...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=33165 |title=Jimmy Carter: National Energy Education Day Remarks on Signing Proclamation 4738 |publisher=The American Presidency Project |date=20 March 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The NEED mission==
The mission of the NEED Project is to promote an energy conscious and educated society by creating effective networks of students, educators, business, government and community leaders to design and deliver objective, multi-sided energy education programs.

The NEED program includes innovative curriculum materials, professional development, evaluation tools, and recognition. NEED teaches the scientific concepts of energy and provides objective information about conventional and emerging energy sources— their use and impact on the environment, economy, and society. The program also educates students about energy efficiency and conservation while providing tools to help educators, energy managers, and consumers use energy wisely.

The NEED mission, goals, and governance are described on the program's website and include links to the organization's annual report and financial statement. [http://www.need.org/mission.php NEED Project Mission]

==NEED's curriculum==
Experts agree students learn best by doing. NEED materials are inquiry based and incorporate the "Kids Teaching Kids" philosophy. NEED makes teaching and learning about energy exciting while developing students' leadership and critical thinking skills.

NEED materials are available for all grade levels from kindergarten through high school. With NEED's extensive curriculum, educators can design classroom programs that spark the interest of their students and meet course objectives. NEED materials are designed to meet and correlate to the National Science Education Content Standards, as well as many state standards. Educators who use NEED materials report that their students score better on end-of-grade testing, are more actively engaged in learning, and develop leadership skills as members of the community.

To ensure that teachers and students are working with accurate information, NEED materials are updated on a regular basis, using the latest data from the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]], as well as from a wide range of energy industry partners. NEED works with educators and students to improve existing materials and develop new ones to meet national and state curriculum requirements. In a special partnership with the [[Energy Information Administration]], NEED helps make energy information and data available to students via the EIA Kid's Page website. In 2006, the Kid's Page was one of the most popular EIA products—averaging over 350,000 user sessions per month.
NEED welcomes partners who vitalize the NEED network with new curriculum materials and new schools. A partnership with [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] expanded the PG&amp;E Solar Schools program to over 600 teachers in the PG&amp;E service area. Schools receive NEED Solar Kits, Science of Energy Kits, teacher training and the opportunity to apply for photovoltaic (solar) installations and classroom grants.

NEED continues to grow at the national and the local level thanks to the support of committed sponsors and partners. Companies and organizations of all types and sizes work with NEED to invest in the future of energy and energy education. NEED sponsors and partners recognize the value of educating tomorrow's workforce for careers in energy. Each partnership is unique. Each partnership considers an energy literate public a pathway to overcoming the energy challenges of the future.

The NEED curriculum is divided into eight steps; each builds on the others to form a comprehensive energy unit that encourages even the youngest students to understand how energy is involved in everything that happens in the world.

NEED offers over 130+ curriculum guides available for free PDF download at the [http://www.need.org/curriculum NEED Store]

==Training and professional development==
Teachers are the key to the success of the NEED program. NEED teachers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories reach more than four million students each year in their local schools, and many more through outreach programs. Providing teachers with innovative training programs and opportunities to increase their own energy knowledge is a major objective of the NEED program.

Training is offered at local, state, regional and national levels. During the school year, NEED coordinators, lead teachers, and student leaders facilitate workshops for teachers, students, parents, and community members that may range from a few hours to several days. At these workshops, attendees receive an introduction to the NEED curriculum. Additional training for special topics like solar, hydrogen, wind, energy on public lands, or energy management is available in many areas of the NEED network. NEED specializes in creating a first-class training experience, which is consistently scored by participants as one of the best professional development experiences available.

In the summer, the National Energy Conferences for Educators give teachers and energy professionals the opportunity to meet other educators from across the country, design and develop NEED units for their classrooms, increase their energy knowledge, and earn graduate credit. They participate in NEED activities and field trips to energy sites such as nuclear power plants, coalmines, offshore oil production facilities, solar energy facilities, hydroelectric dams, and energy efficiency projects.

NEED sponsors and partners provide sponsorship for teachers, and they participate as speakers and field trip guides. Some NEED states also sponsor summer energy camps for kids, spring break day camps, and overnight energy weekends. Many NEED schools work with scout troops and community youth groups to help them gain energy-related merit badges and community service hours.

NEED Energy Workshop Opportunities are listed on the NEED Calendar here: [http://www.need.org/calendar.php NEED Calendar]

==The NEED network==
The long-term success of NEED depends on the support of its network. The educators, students, directors, coordinators, sponsors, and community partners who support the program say that working with NEED is one of the most rewarding things about their jobs. The board of Directors facilitates the implementation of NEED's strategic plan for expansion and helps support NEED's goal of providing an energy education program to every interested school in America. Board members volunteer their time and talents to make sure that NEED has a strong foundation and that the programs and materials reach the greatest number of people each year. Each member of the Board provides funding for the development of NEED programs.

State programs are a vital component of NEED's mission. State coordinators and NEED lead teachers, partners, and sponsors provide day-to-day guidance to local programs, conduct regional and local training programs, design and distribute materials, support teachers, and help develop new NEED programs and activities. These state programs make NEED work at the local level—helping connect the state education standards to NEED programs and materials.
NEED stays connected to its network via its newsletters— Energy Exchange and Career Currents—and a variety of resources and opportunities available on NEED's website, www.need.org, and many outreach events each year. Energy Exchange provides teachers, students, and sponsors with information and activities about energy and exciting new technologies and discoveries. NEED's new newsletter, Career Currents, exposes students to the diversity of energy careers. Both newsletters are distributed bimonthly, and all issues are available on www.need.org.

With a new look this year, www.need.org gives teachers a resource for curriculum publications and activity guides, a place to discuss their NEED programs, and links to a variety of supplemental resources. The website also provides students with methods for choosing science fair experiments, fact sheets for research projects, activities to reinforce knowledge, and resources on the nation's leading energy sources, electricity, and conservation. NEED also partners with the [[Energy Information Administration]] on their [http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/ EIA Kid’s Page], the premier site for kids to find reliable, up-to-date energy information and loads of fun energy activities.

Since its inception in 1980, NEED has grown from a one-day celebration of energy awareness to a national organization dedicated o introducing energy into the curriculum at every grade level. This growth would be impossible without the continued support of NEED's sponsors and partners at the national, state, and local level ho provide funding, time, energy, and technical assistance. NEED sponsors and partners believe in the importance of a comprehensive energy education program that helps teachers and students understand energy and its impacts on their world.

'''The National Institute for Trial Advocacy''' (referred to as "NITA") is a not for profit organization that was initially formed in 1969 in an effort to provide lawyers with better trial skills training, and was spurred on by criticisms within the judicial system of the apparent lack of trial preparation occurring within law schools. This initial group of law professors and lawyers worked with the intention of addressing this problem and came to the conclusion that [[Experiential learning|learning-by-doing]] trial training was the best approach. This group spent two more years improving their trial material and in 1972 NITA's inaugural National Session was held at the University of Colorado in Boulder. This program brings together participants from all across the country who are taught through a learning by doing approach how to better represent their clients in the courtroom. The national session has been held every year since 1972&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nita.org/page.asp?id=7&amp;catid=32&amp;prodid=362 NITA Web Site | Building Trial Skills: National Session&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and NITA has since expanded its scope, holding public service trial training sessions in a variety of specialties across the country as well as other skills courses including deposition and courtroom technology skills.

'''Artis''', short for '''Natura Artis Magistra''' ([[Latin]] for "Nature is the teacher of the arts"), is a [[zoo]] in the centre of [[Amsterdam]]. It is the oldest zoo in the [[Netherlands]] and one of the oldest zoos of mainland Europe. Next to possessing a zoo, Artis also contains an [[public aquarium|aquarium]] and a [[planetarium]]. Artis also has an [[arboretum]] and a fairly large art collection. A part of the art collection is on display in the Aquarium building of the zoo. Artis contains 27 monumental buildings, most of which are used as enclosures for the animals, making Artis a unique cultural heritage of the 19th century.

The zoo is a member of the [[Dutch Zoo Federation]] (NVD), the [[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]] (EAZA), the [[International Species Information System]] (ISIS), and the [[World Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (WAZA).

==History==
The zoo was founded in 1838 by Gerard Westerman, J.W.H. Werlemann and J.J. Wijsmuller (also known as the three Ws). It was initially open only to members. Starting in 1851 it was opened to the public during the month of September.&lt;ref name="Mehos_founding"/&gt; In 1920 it was opened year-round to the public, but September remains discount month.&lt;ref name="zoo_discover"/&gt;

The core of the current zoo property, then the "Middenhof" estate, was purchased by the board of the zoological society "Natura Artis Magistra" late in 1838 in the [[Plantage (Amsterdam)|Plantage]], which was then a rural area on the outskirts of Amsterdam. From the start it exhibited both live and mounted specimens.&lt;ref name="zma_about"/&gt;

The zoo is commonly referred to as Artis, because the zoo has three gates with the words 'Natura', 'Artis', and 'Magistra' written above each of them, respectively. More often than not, only the middle gate was open, so that people who walked through it, seeing that 'Artis' was written above it, believed that the zoo was just called Artis. Thanks to this, soon few people knew it by its full name: Natura Artis Magistra.

The last [[quagga]] in captivity died at Artis on 12 August 1883. At the time, because all zebras were referred to as quagga, nobody realized that this was the last quagga alive until years later.

==Historic buildings==
Artis includes 27 historic buildings. The Aquarium was built in 1882 on land leased from the city on condition that only a museum ever be built on it.&lt;ref name="Mehos_aquarium"/&gt; The library dates back to 1867 and the building the 'Ledenlokalen' on the right side of the main entrance dates back to the 19th century as well.

The wolf house (formerly an inn), and the Masman Garden House which now houses scarlet ibis were both on the site before the zoo was established.&lt;ref name="zoo_discover"/&gt;

==Library==
[[File:UvA Artis Bibliotheek.jpg|thumb|Artis Library]]
Artis has a library on the history of zoology and botany. It houses the library of the zoo, as well as the libraries of the [[Zoological Museum Amsterdam]] and the [[Amsterdam Botanical Garden]]. It also hosts the archives of a number of zoologists and botanists, such as the archive of [[Hugo de Vries]].  It contains 20,000 books, 3000 manuscripts and 80,000 animal prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bijzonderecollecties.uva.nl/de-bijzondere-collecties/verzamelgebieden/verzamelgebieden/verzamelgebieden/content/folder/natuurlijke-historie.html|title=Bijzondere Collecties: Natuurlijke History|publisher=Amsterdam University Library|date=|accessdate=2012-10-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503000838/http://www.bijzonderecollecties.uva.nl/de-bijzondere-collecties/verzamelgebieden/verzamelgebieden/verzamelgebieden/content/folder/natuurlijke-historie.html|archivedate=2014-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library is part of the special collections of the University of Amsterdam.

'''''QS World University Rankings''''' is an annual publication of [[university rankings]] by [[Quacquarelli Symonds|Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)]]. Previously known as ''[[Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings]]'', the publisher had collaborated with ''[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education magazine]]'' (''THE'')  to publish its international league tables from 2004 to 2009 before both started to announce their own versions. QS then chose to continue using the pre-existing methodology while ''Times Higher Education'' adopted a new methodology to create [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings|their rankings]].

The QS system now comprises the global overall and subject rankings (which name the world's top universities for the study of 48 different subjects and five composite faculty areas), alongside five independent regional tables (Asia, Latin America, Emerging Europe and Central Asia, the Arab Region, and BRICS).&lt;ref name=vs&gt;{{cite web|title=Asian University Rankings - QS Asian University Rankings vs. QS World University Rankings™|url=http://www.iu.qs.com/university-rankings/qs-ur-asia/|quote=The methodology differs somewhat from that used for the QS World University Rankings...|access-date=2013-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606123045/http://www.iu.qs.com/university-rankings/qs-ur-asia/|archive-date=2013-06-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A perceived need for an international ranking of universities for UK purposes was highlighted in December 2003 in [[Richard Lambert]]'s review of university-industry collaboration in Britain&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/lambert_review_business_university_collab.htm Lambert Review of Business-University Collaboration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019130440/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/lambert_review_business_university_collab.htm |date=October 19, 2011 }} ([http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/lambert_review_business_university_collab.htm since archived])&lt;/ref&gt; for [[HM Treasury]], the finance ministry of the United Kingdom. Amongst its recommendations were world university rankings, which Lambert said would help the UK to gauge the global standing of its universities.

The idea for the rankings was credited in Ben Wildavsky's book, ''The Great Brain Race: How Global Universities are Reshaping the World'',&lt;ref&gt;Princeton University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; to then-editor of ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' (''THE''), [[John O'Leary (journalist)|John O'Leary]]. ''THE'' chose to partner with educational and careers advice company [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] (QS) to supply the data, appointing Martin Ince,&lt;ref name="Martin Ince Communications"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinince.eu|title=Martin Ince Communications|work=Martin Ince Communications|accessdate=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220114549/http://www.martinince.eu/|archive-date=2014-12-20|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly deputy editor and later a contractor to ''THE'', to manage the project.

Between 2004 and 2009, QS produced the rankings in partnership with ''THE''. In 2009, ''THE'' announced they would produce their own rankings, the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]], in partnership with [[Thomson Reuters]]. ''THE'' cited an asserted weakness in the methodology of the original rankings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mroz |first=Ann |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=408968&amp;c=1 |title=Leader: Only the best for the best |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=2010-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807065437/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=408968&amp;c=1 |archive-date=2010-08-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a perceived favoritism in the existing methodology for science over the humanities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baty |first=Phil |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2010/03/15/baty |title=Views: Ranking Confession |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |date=2010-09-10 |accessdate=2010-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715141223/http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2010/03/15/baty |archive-date=2010-07-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as two of the key reasons for the decision to split with QS.

QS retained intellectual property in the prior rankings and the methodology used to compile them{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and continues to produce rankings based on that methodology, which are now called the QS World University Rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://chronicle.com/article/Times-Higher-Education/124455/?sid=at | first=Aisha | last=Labi | journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education | location=London, UK | title=Times Higher Education Releases New Rankings, but Will They Appease Skeptics? | date=2010-09-15| accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''THE'' created a new methodology with Thomson Reuters, and published the first [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] in September 2010.

QS publishes the rankings results in the world's media and has entered into partnerships with a number of outlets, including [[The Guardian]] in the United Kingdom, and [[Chosun Ilbo]] in Korea. The first rankings produced by QS independently of THE, and using QS's consistent and original methodology, were released on September 8, 2010, with the second appearing on September 6, 2011.

QS designed its rankings in order to assess performance according to what it believes to be key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research, nurturing employability, and internationalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msmbainusa.com/articles/life-in-usa/5-parameters-related-to-global-university-ranking/|title=MS and MBA in USA|work=MS MBA in USA|accessdate=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418142816/http://www.msmbainusa.com/articles/life-in-usa/5-parameters-related-to-global-university-ranking/|archive-date=2015-04-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Academic peer review'''

This is the most controversial part of the methodology{{weasel inline|date=February 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}. Using a combination of purchased mailing lists and applications and suggestions, this survey asks active academicians across the world about the top universities in their specialist fields. QS has published the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants.&lt;ref name=QC2012/&gt;

The 2017/18 rankings made use of responses from 75,015 people from over 140 nations for its Academic Reputation indicator, including votes from the previous five years rolled forward provided there was no more recent information available from the same individual. Participants can nominate up to 30 universities but are not able to vote for their own. They tend to nominate a median of about 20, which means that this survey includes over 500,000 data points. The average respondent possesses 20.4 years of academic experience, while 81% of respondents have over a decade of experience in the academic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iu.qs.com/academic-survey-responses/|title=QS Intelligence Unit -   2018 Academic Survey Responses|website=www.iu.qs.com|accessdate=29 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715122214/http://www.iu.qs.com/academic-survey-responses/|archive-date=2017-07-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=QC2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/world-university-rankings/2011-academic-survey-responses/ |title=2011 Academic Survey Responses |accessdate=12 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206024212/http://www.iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/world-university-rankings/2011-academic-survey-responses/ |archivedate=February 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, when the rankings first appeared, academic peer review accounted for half of a university's possible score. In 2005, its share was cut to 40 per cent because of the introduction of the Employer Reputation Survey.

'''Faculty student ratio'''

This indicator accounts for 20 per cent of a university's possible score in the rankings. It is a classic measure used in various ranking systems as a proxy for teaching commitment, but QS has admitted that it is less than satisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/rankings-indicators/methodology-faculty-student/ QS Intelligence Unit | Faculty Student Ratio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012150310/http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/rankings-indicators/methodology-faculty-student/ |date=October 12, 2011 }}. Iu.qs.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Citations per faculty'''

Citations of published research are among the most widely used inputs to national and global university rankings. The QS World University Rankings used citations data from Thomson (now Thomson Reuters) from 2004 to 2007, and since then has used data from Scopus, part of Elsevier. The total number of citations for a five-year period is divided by the number of academics in a university to yield the score for this measure, which accounts for 20 per cent of a university's possible score in the Rankings.

QS has explained that it uses this approach, rather than the citations per paper preferred for other systems, because it reduces the effect of biomedical science on the overall picture – bio-medicine has a ferocious "[[publish or perish]]" culture. Instead QS attempts to measure the density of research-active staff at each institution. But issues still remain about the use of citations in ranking systems, especially the fact that the arts and humanities generate comparatively few citations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/rankings-indicators/methodology-citations-per-faculty/ QS Intelligence Unit | Citations per Faculty] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028174836/http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/rankings-indicators/methodology-citations-per-faculty/ |date=October 28, 2011 }}. Iu.qs.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since 2015, QS have made methodological enhancements designed to remove the advantage institutions specializing in the Natural Sciences or Medicine previously received. This enhancement is termed faculty area normalization, and ensures that an institution's citations count in each of QS's five key Faculty Areas is weighted to account for 20% of the final citations score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://content.qs.com/qsiu/Faculty_Area_Normalization_-_Technical_Explanation.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911063143/http://content.qs.com/qsiu/Faculty_Area_Normalization_-_Technical_Explanation.pdf# |archive-date=2015-09-11 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

QS has conceded the presence of some data collection errors regarding citations per faculty in previous years' rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rankingwatch.blogspot.com/2007/11/another-kenan-flagler-case-of.html|title=University Ranking Watch|author=Richard Holmes|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316031626/http://rankingwatch.blogspot.com/2007/11/another-kenan-flagler-case-of.html|archive-date=2015-03-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One interesting issue is the difference between the Scopus and Thomson Reuters databases. For major world universities, the two systems capture more or less the same publications and citations. For less mainstream institutions, Scopus has more non-English language and smaller-circulation journals in its database. But as the papers there are less heavily cited, this can also mean fewer citations per paper for the universities that publish in them.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
This area has been criticized for undermining universities which do not use English as their primary language.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.eua.be/Libraries/Publications_homepage_list/Global_University_Rankings_and_Their_Impact.sflb.ashx Global university rankings and their impact] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826181934/http://www.eua.be/Libraries/Publications_homepage_list/Global_University_Rankings_and_Their_Impact.sflb.ashx |date=2012-08-26 }},". "European University Association". Retrieved 3, September, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Citations and publications in a language different from English are harder to come across. The English language is the most internationalized language and therefore is also the most popular when citing.

'''Employer review'''

This part of the ranking is obtained by a similar method to the Academic Peer Review, except that it samples recruiters who hire graduates on a global or significant national scale. The numbers are smaller – 40,455 responses from over 130 countries in the 2016 Rankings – and are used to produce 10 per cent of any university's possible score. This survey was introduced in 2005 in the belief that employers track graduate quality, making this a barometer of teaching quality, a famously problematic thing to measure. University standing here is of special interest to potential students, and acknowledging this was the impetus behind the inaugural QS Graduate Employability Rankings, published in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iu.qs.com/employer-survey-responses/ QS Intelligence Unit | Employer Reputation]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824072517/http://www.iu.qs.com/employer-survey-responses/ |date=August 24, 2016 }}.

'''International orientation'''

The final ten per cent of a university's possible score is derived from measures intended to capture their internationalism: five percent from their percentage of international students, and another five percent from their percentage of international staff.
This is of interest partly because it shows whether a university is putting effort into being global, but also because it tells us whether it is taken seriously enough by students and academics around the world for them to want to be there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/rankings-indicators/methodology-international/ QS Intelligence Unit | International Indicators] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024033150/http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/rankings-indicators/methodology-international/ |date=October 24, 2011 }}.

In September 2015, both The Guardian and The Daily Mail referred to the QS World University Rankings as "the most authoritative of their kind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weale|first1=Sally|title=British universities slip down in global rankings|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/15/british-universities-slip-downing-global-rankings|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=15 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910151235/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/15/british-universities-slip-downing-global-rankings|archive-date=2016-09-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Julian|title=American universities take the top THREE places in the world rankings: MIT crowned the best just ahead of Harvard and Stanford|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3237039/US-three-universities-world-Massachusetts-Institute-Technology-crowned-best.html|website=The Daily Mail|publisher=The Daily Mail|accessdate=15 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011132639/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3237039/US-three-universities-world-Massachusetts-Institute-Technology-crowned-best.html|archive-date=2016-10-11|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kich|first1=Martin|title=U.S. Higher Education News for September 15, 2015|url=https://academeblog.org/2015/09/17/u-s-higher-education-news-for-september-15-2015/|website=Academe Blog|publisher=Martin Kich|accessdate=15 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222183953/https://academeblog.org/2015/09/17/u-s-higher-education-news-for-september-15-2015/|archive-date=2016-02-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Ben Sowter, Head of Research at the QS Intelligence Unit, was ranked in 40th position in [http://wonkhe.com/about-us/ Wonkhe]'s 2016 'Higher Education Power List'. The list enumerated what the organisation believed to be the 50 most influential figures in UK higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leach|first1=Mark|title=Higher Education Power List - 2016|url=http://wonkhe.com/2016-higher-education-powerlist/?mc_cid=27307da84d&amp;mc_eid=7a7d83a8aa|website=WonkHe|publisher=WonkHe|accessdate=19 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924134716/http://wonkhe.com/2016-higher-education-powerlist/?mc_cid=27307da84d&amp;mc_eid=7a7d83a8aa|archive-date=2016-09-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several universities in the UK and the Asia-Pacific region have commented on the rankings positively. Vice-Chancellor of New Zealand's [[Massey University]], Professor Judith Kinnear, says that the Times Higher Education-QS ranking is a "wonderful external acknowledgement of several university attributes, including the quality of its research, research training, teaching and employability." She said the rankings are a true measure of a university's ability to fly high internationally: "The Times Higher Education ranking provides a rather more and more sophisticated, robust and well rounded measure of international and national ranking than either New Zealand's [[Performance Based Research Fund]] (PBRF) measure or the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities|Shanghai rankings]]."&lt;ref name="Flying high internationally"&gt;[http://masseynews.massey.ac.nz/2004/Press_Releases/11_11_04.html Flying high internationally] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211121732/http://masseynews.massey.ac.nz/2004/Press_Releases/11_11_04.html |date=December 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2012 the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' described the QS World University Rankings as being "widely recognised throughout higher education as the most trusted international tables".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/cambridge-loses-top-spot-to-massachusetts-institute-of-technology-8122436.html|title=Cambridge loses top spot to Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=11 September 2012|publisher=The Independent|date=11 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915010853/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/cambridge-loses-top-spot-to-massachusetts-institute-of-technology-8122436.html|archive-date=2012-09-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angel Calderon, Principal Advisor for Planning and Research at [[RMIT University]] and member of the QS Advisory Board, spoke positively of the QS University Rankings for Latin America, saying that the "QS Latin American University Rankings has become the annual international benchmark universities use to ascertain their relative standing in the region". He further stated that the 2016/17 edition of this ranking demonstrated improved stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Calderon|first1=Angel|title=How to boost your university’s ranking position|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2016062113365585|website=University World News|publisher=University World News|accessdate=14 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915010535/http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2016062113365585|archive-date=2016-09-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticisms ====
Certain commentators have expressed concern about the use or misuse of survey data. However, QS's Intelligence Unit, responsible for compiling the rankings, state that the extent of the sample size used for their surveys mean that they are now "almost impossible to manipulate and very difficult for institutions to ‘game’". They also state that "over 62,000 academic respondents contributed to our 2013 academic results, four times more than in 2010. Independent academic reviews have confirmed these results to be more than 99% reliable". Furthermore, since 2013, the number of respondents to QS's Academic Reputation Survey has increased again. Their survey now makes use of nearly 75,000 academic peer reviews, making it "to date, the world’s largest aggregation of feeling in this [the global academic] community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Academic Survey Responses|url=http://www.iu.qs.com/academic-survey-responses/|website=QS Intelligence Unit|publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=14 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824072418/http://www.iu.qs.com/academic-survey-responses/|archive-date=2016-08-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Academic Reputation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic Reputation|url=http://www.iu.qs.com/university-rankings/indicator-academic/|website=QS Intelligence Unit|publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=14 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920132319/http://www.iu.qs.com/university-rankings/indicator-academic/|archive-date=2016-09-20|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moran|first1=Jack|title=Top 200 universities in the world 2016: the global trends|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/sep/05/top-200-universities-in-the-world-2016-the-global-trends?CMP=share_btn_tw|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=14 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924231435/https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/sep/05/top-200-universities-in-the-world-2016-the-global-trends?CMP=share_btn_tw|archive-date=2016-09-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The QS World University Rankings have been criticised by many for placing too much emphasis on peer review, which receives 40 percent of the overall score. Some people have expressed concern about the manner in which the peer review has been carried out.&lt;ref name="UniversityRankingWatch"&gt;{{cite web |last=Holmes |first=Richard |url=http://rankingwatch.blogspot.com/2006/09/so-thats-how-they-did-it-for-some-time.html |title=So That's how They Did It |publisher=Rankingwatch.blogspot.com |date=2006-09-05 |accessdate=2010-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808023918/http://rankingwatch.blogspot.com/2006/09/so-thats-how-they-did-it-for-some-time.html |archive-date=2010-08-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report,&lt;ref name="Wills"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aus.ac.nz/branches/auckland/akld06/AUS-SP.pdf|title=Response to Review of Strategic Plan by Peter Wills|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080406192737/http://www.aus.ac.nz/branches/auckland/akld06/AUS-SP.pdf|archivedate=6 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Wills from the [[University of Auckland]] wrote of the ''Times Higher Education''-QS World University Rankings: {{quote|But we note also that this survey establishes its rankings by appealing to university staff, even offering financial enticements to participate (see Appendix II). Staff are likely to feel it is in their greatest interest to rank their own institution more highly than others. This means the results of the survey and any apparent change in ranking are highly questionable, and that a high ranking has no real intrinsic value in any case. We are vehemently opposed to the evaluation of the University according to the outcome of such PR competitions.}}

However, QS state that no survey participant, academic or employer, is offered a financial incentive to respond, while no academic is able to vote for their own institution. This renders this particular criticism invalid, as it is based on two incorrect premises: (1) that academics are currently financially incentivized to participate, and (2) that conflicts of interests are created by academics being able to vote for their own institution.

Academicians previously criticized of the use of the citation database, arguing that it undervalues institutions which excel in the social sciences. Ian Diamond, former chief executive of the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] and now vice-chancellor of the [[University of Aberdeen]] and a member of the THE editorial board, wrote to ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' in 2007, saying:&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=311132 |title=Social sciences lose 1 |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2010-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123141114/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=311132 |archive-date=2011-11-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The use of a citation database must have an impact because such databases do not have as wide a cover of the social sciences (or arts and humanities) as the natural sciences. Hence the low position of the [[London School of Economics]], caused primarily by its citations score, is a result not of the output of an outstanding institution but the database and the fact that the LSE does not have the counterweight of a large natural science base.}}

However, in 2015, QS's introduction of faculty area normalization ensured that QS's rankings no longer conferred an undue advantage or disadvantage upon any institution based on their particular subject specialisms. Correspondingly, the London School of Economics rose from 71st in 2014 to 35th in 2015 and 37th in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty Area Normalization – Technical Explanation|url=http://content.qs.com/qsiu/Faculty_Area_Normalization_-_Technical_Explanation.pdf|publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=14 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911063143/http://content.qs.com/qsiu/Faculty_Area_Normalization_-_Technical_Explanation.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-11|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the split from ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' in 2009, further concerns about the methodology QS uses for its rankings have been brought up by several experts.

In October 2010, criticism of the old system came from Fred L. Bookstein, Horst Seidler, Martin Fieder and Georg Winckler in the journal ''Scientomentrics'' for the unreliability of QS's methods: {{quote|Several individual indicators from the Times Higher Education Survey (THES) data base the overall score, the reported staff-to-student ratio, and the peer ratings—demonstrate unacceptably high fluctuation from year to year. The inappropriateness of the summary tabulations for assessing the majority of the "top 200" universities would be apparent purely for reason of this obvious statistical instability regardless of other grounds of criticism. There are far too many anomalies in the change scores of the various indices for them to be of use in the course of university management.&lt;ref name=Scientometrics&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/d02771828173244w/ |title=Scientometrics, Volume 85, Number 1 |publisher=SpringerLink |date= |accessdate=2010-09-16 |doi=10.1007/s11192-010-0189-5 |volume=85 |journal=Scientometrics |pages=295–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an article for the New Statesman entitled "The QS World University Rankings are a load of old baloney", [[David Blanchflower]], a leading [[labour economics|labour economist]], said: "This ranking is complete rubbish and nobody should place any credence in it. The results are based on an entirely flawed methodology that underweights the quality of research and overweights fluff... The QS is a flawed index and should be ignored." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-blanchflower/2011/09/world-university-faculty|title=The QS World University Rankings are a load of old baloney|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016175355/http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-blanchflower/2011/09/world-university-faculty|archive-date=2013-10-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Martin Ince,&lt;ref name="Martin Ince Communications"/&gt; chair of the Advisory Board for the Rankings, points out that their volatility has been reduced since 2007 by the introduction of the Z-score calculation method and that over time, the quality of QS's data gathering has improved to reduce anomalies. In addition, the academic and employer review are now so big that even modestly ranked universities receive a statistically valid number of votes. QS has published extensive data &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iu.qs.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/|title=QS Intelligence Unit -   QS World University Rankings|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106140149/http://www.iu.qs.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/|archive-date=2016-01-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on who the respondents are, where they are, and the subjects and industries to which the academicians and employers respectively belong.

The QS Subject Rankings have been dismissed as unreliable by [[Brian Leiter]], who points out that programmes which are known to be high quality, and which rank highly in the Blackwell rankings (e.g., the University of Pittsburgh) fare poorly in the QS ranking for reasons that are not at all clear.&lt;ref name=haziness&gt;[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/guardian-and-qs-rankings-definitively-prove-the-existence-of-the-halo-effect.html Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog: Guardian and "QS Rankings" Definitively Prove the Existence of the "Halo Effect"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801024604/http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/guardian-and-qs-rankings-definitively-prove-the-existence-of-the-halo-effect.html |date=2012-08-01 }}.

In an article titled ''The Globalisation of College and University Rankings'' and appearing in the January/February 2012 issue of ''Change'' magazine, Philip Altbach, professor of higher education at Boston College and also a member of the THE editorial board, said: "The QS World University Rankings are the most problematical.  From the beginning, the QS has relied on reputational indicators for half of its analysis … it probably accounts for the significant variability in the QS rankings over the years.  In addition, QS queries employers, introducing even more variability and unreliability into the mix.  Whether the QS rankings should be taken seriously by the higher education community is questionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2012/January-February%202012/Globalization-abstract.html|title=Change Magazine - January-February 2012|author=Change Magazine - Taylor &amp; Francis|date=13 January 2012|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512235327/http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2012/January-February%202012/Globalization-abstract.html|archive-date=2015-05-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at University of Melbourne and a member of the THE editorial board, in the article "Improving Latin American universities' global ranking" for University World News on 10 June 2012, said: "I will not discuss the QS ranking because the methodology is not sufficiently robust to provide data valid as social science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120606174803978|title=Improving Latin American universities' global ranking - University World News|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615005657/http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120606174803978|archive-date=2013-06-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; QS's Intelligence Unit counter these criticisms by stating that "Independent academic reviews have confirmed these results to be more than 99% reliable".&lt;ref name="Academic Reputation"/&gt;

===Young Universities===
QS also releases the ''QS Top 50 under 50 Ranking'' annually to rank universities which have been established for under 50 years. These institutions are judged based on their positions on the overall table of the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/top-50-under-50|title=QS Top 50 under 50|publisher=Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=2013-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615182510/http://www.topuniversities.com/top-50-under-50|archive-date=2013-06-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2015, QS's "'Top 50 Under 50" ranking was expanded to include the world's top 100 institutions under 50 years of age, while in 2017 it was again expanded to include the world's top 150 universities in this cohort. In 2017, the table was topped by [[Nanyang Technological University]] of [[Singapore]] for the fourth consecutive year. The table is dominated by universities from the Asia-Pacific region, with the top six places taken by Asian institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Symonds|first1=Quacquarelli|title=QS Top 50 Under 50|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/top-50-under-50|website=Top Universities|publisher=Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=19 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725205631/https://www.topuniversities.com/top-50-under-50|archive-date=2017-07-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faculties and subjects===
QS also ranks universities by [[discipline (specialism)|academic discipline]] organized into 5 faculties, namely [[Arts]] [[Humanities|&amp; Humanities]], [[Engineering|Engineering &amp; Technology]], [[Life Sciences]] [[Medicine|&amp; Medicine]], [[Natural Science]]s and [[Social Sciences|Social Sciences &amp; Management]]. The methodology is based on surveying expert academics and global employers, and measuring research performance using data sourced from Elsevier's Scopus database. In the ''2018 QS World University Rankings by Subject'' the world's best universities for the study of 48 different subjects are named. The two new subject tables added in the most recent edition are: Classics &amp; Ancient History and Library &amp; Information Management.

The world's leading institution in 2018's tables in terms of most world-leading positions is [[Harvard University]], which is number one for 14 subjects. Its longtime rankings rival, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], is number one for twelve subjects.&lt;ref name=subjects/&gt;

===Asia===
In 2009, QS launched the ''QS Asian University Rankings'' or ''QS University Rankings: Asia'' in partnership with ''[[The Chosun Ilbo]]'' newspaper in Korea to rank universities in Asia independently. The Ninth instalment, released for the 2017/18 academic year, ranks the 350 best universities in Asia, and is led by [[Nanyang Technological University]], Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2018|title=QS University Rankings: Asia 2018|date=2017-10-12|work=Top Universities|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616022557/http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2016|archive-date=2016-06-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rankings use some of the same criteria as the world rankings, but there are changed weightings and new criteria. One addition is the criterion of incoming and outgoing exchange students. Accordingly, the performance of Asian institutions in the ''QS World University Rankings'' and the ''QS Asian University Rankings'' released in the same academic year are different from each other.&lt;ref name=vs/&gt;

===Latin America===
The ''QS Latin American University Rankings'' or ''QS University Rankings: Latin America'' were launched in 2011. They use academic opinion (30%), employer opinion (20%), publications per faculty member, citations per paper, academic staff with a PhD, faculty/student ratio and web visibility (10 per cent each) as measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iu.qs.com/university-rankings/qs-urlat/|title= Methodology (QS University Rankings – Latin America)|publisher= ''Quacquarelli Symonds''|accessdate= 12 August 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140729023629/http://www.iu.qs.com/university-rankings/qs-urlat/|archive-date= 2014-07-29|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016/17 edition of the QS World University Rankings: Latin America ranks the top 300 universities in the region. The [[Universidade de São Paulo]] retained its status as the region's best university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/latin-american-university-rankings/2016|website=Top Universities|title=QS World University Rankings: Latin America|publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=14 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913224217/http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/latin-american-university-rankings/2016|archive-date=2016-09-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===QS Best Student Cities Ranking===

In 2012, QS launched the ''QS Best Student Cities'' ranking - a table designed to evaluate which cities were most likely to provide students with a high-quality student experience. Five editions of the ranking have been published thus far, with Paris taking the number-one position in four of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2016|title=QS Best Student Cities 2016|date=30 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705012219/https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2016|archive-date=2017-07-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2015|title=QS Best Student Cities 2015|date=21 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703030558/https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2015|archive-date=2017-07-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2014|title=QS Best Student Cities 2014|date=14 November 2013|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828024118/https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2014|archive-date=2017-08-28|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 edition was also the first one to see the introduction of student opinion as a contributory indicator. The most recent edition of the ranking was released on May 9, 2018. It saw London take the number-one spot from Montreal.

==QS Stars==
QS also offers universities an auditing service that provides in-depth information about institutional strengths and weaknesses. Called QS Stars, this service is separate from the QS World University Rankings. It involves a detailed look at a range of functions which mark out a modern, global university. The minimum result that a university can receive is zero Stars, while truly exceptional, world-leading universities can receive '5*+', or 'Five Star Plus', status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to about 50 different indicators. By 2018, about 20 different universities worldwide had been awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QS Stars University Ratings|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/qs-stars#sorting=overall+country=+rating=6+order=desc+orderby=uni+search=|website=Top Universities|publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds|access-date=2016-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914092702/http://www.topuniversities.com/qs-stars#sorting=overall+country=+rating=6+order=desc+orderby=uni+search=|archive-date=2016-09-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QS Stars ratings are derived from scores on in eight out of 12 categories. Four categories are mandatory, while institutions must choose the remaining four optional categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-stars/what-qs-stars|title=What is QS Stars?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704120008/https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-stars/what-qs-stars|archive-date=2017-07-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:
* Teaching
* Employability
* Research
* Internationalization
* Facilities
* Online/Distance Learning
* Arts &amp; Culture
* Innovation
* Inclusiveness
* Social Responsibility
* Subject Ranking
* Program Strength&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-stars/qs-stars-methodology|title=QS Stars Methodology|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704211824/https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-stars/qs-stars-methodology|archive-date=2017-07-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stars is an evaluation system, not a ranking. About 400 institutions had opted for the Stars evaluation as of early 2018.  In 2012, fees to participate in this program were $9850 for the initial audit and an annual license fee of $6850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/world/europe/31iht-educlede31.html?pagewanted=all|title=Ratings at a Price for Smaller Universities|accessdate=10 September 2013|publisher=The New York Times|date=30 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415004317/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/world/europe/31iht-educlede31.html?pagewanted=all|archive-date=2013-04-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''social space''' is physical or virtual space such as a [[social center]], [[social media|online social media]], or other [[gathering place]] where people gather and interact. Some social spaces such as [[town square]]s or [[park]]s are [[public places]]; others such as [[pub]]s, [[website]]s. or [[shopping mall]]s are privately owned and regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 12, 23, 24, 34, and 78 in ''Watch this Space: Designing, Defending, and Sharing Public Space'', by Hadley Dyer and Marc Ngui, Kids Can Press (2010), hardcover, 80 pages, {{ISBN|978-1-55453-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henri Lefebvre]] emphasised that in human society all 'space is social: it involves assigning more or less appropriated places to social relations....social space has thus always been a social product'.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lefebvre, ''State, Space, World'' (London 2009) p. 186-7&lt;/ref&gt; 
Social space becomes thereby a metaphor for the very experience of social life - 'society experienced alternatively as a deterministic environment or force (''milieu'') and as our very element or beneficent shell (''ambience'')'.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense 'social space spans the dichotomy between "public" and "private" space...is also linked to subjective and [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] space'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Smethurst, ''The Postmodern Chronotype'' (2000) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==As metaphor==

As metaphor, 'social space contributes a relational rather than an abstract dimension...has received a large variety of attributes, interpretations, and metaphors'.&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Kellerman, ''The Internet on Earth'' (2002) p. 31-2&lt;/ref&gt; Such 'social space...i[s] an intricate space of obligations, duties, entitlements, prohibitions, debts, affections, insults, allies, contracts, enemies, infatuations, compromises, mutual love, legitimate expectations, and collective ideals'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Churchland, ''The Engine of Reason, the Seat of the Soul'' (2007) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

For Lefebvre, 'the family, the school, the workplace, the church, and so on - each possesses an "appropriate" space...for a use specified within the social division of labor'.&lt;ref name="Lefebvre225"&gt;Lefebvre, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Within such social spaces 'a system of "adapted" expectations and responses - rarely articulated as such because they seem obvious - acquire a quasi-natural self-evidence in everyday life and common sense': thus everybody [[Consensus|consensually]] 'knows what he is talking about when he refers to the town hall, the post office, the police station, the grocery store, the bus and the train, train stations, and bistros' - all underlying aspects of 'a ''social space'' as such. an (artificial) edifice of hierarchically ordered institutions, of laws and conventions'.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, p. 224-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==

Defining a stratified morphology as a series of 'discrete units embedded within one another in a definite order', one can see that a distinct 'morphology exists in social space - from the "room" or hut to the house and the building; from the building to the group of houses, to the village and the neighbourhood; from the neighbourhood to the city, the region, the nation, and the State...continent [&amp;] planet'.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, p. 235-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The interaction of different levels may be symbiotic or it may be conflictual: as a Michigan cabinet member put it to two Southern colleagues shortly before the [[American Civil War]], '"I see how it is; you are a Virginian and you are a South Carolinian; I am not a Michigander, I am an American"'.&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Nicholas, ''The American Union'' (1950) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

For the individual, as well as the social institution, different levels of social space come to the fore at different times. To a Britisher, for example, '"we" sometimes narrows to southern England, sometimes broadens to refer to "Britain and America" or "Europe" or "the west"'.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fowler, ''Language in the News'' (London 1994) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In precisely the same way, 'a resident of Rome may define himself with varying degrees of intensity as a Roman, an Italian, a Catholic, a Christian, a European, a Westerner'&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Huntington, ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'' (1996) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; - a sequence of stratified social spaces.

==Pre/postmodern space==

'In premodern societies, space and place largely coincided....[[Modernity]] increasingly tears space away from place'.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Giddens, quoted in Kellerman, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in the premodern 'every thing has its assigned place in social space',&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (London 1971) p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; [[postmodernists]] would proudly proclaim that 'we need to substitute for the magisterial space of the past...a less upright, less Euclidean space where no one would ever be ''in his final place'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Barthes, in E. D. Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Oxford 1992) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The way 'migration, seen as a metaphor, is everywhere' in postmodernity - 'we are migrants and perhaps hybrids, in but not of any situation in which we find ourselves'&lt;ref&gt;Edward Said, ''After the Last Sky Palestinian Lives'' New York: Pantheon, 1986. p. 164. Later quoted by Salman Rushdie, ''Imaginary Homelands'' (London 1991) p. 278 and p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; - is rooted in the postmodern forms of production of social space.

Lefebvre considered [[globalization]] as the creation, and superimposition on nature, of 'worldwide-social space...with strong points (the centers) and weaker and dominated bases (the [[Periphery countries|peripheries]])'.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, p. 199 and p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

==The insanity of place==

Education, formal and informal, might be described as in large part a process whereby the new recruit to the human race 'must learn to represent the many dimensions of the local social space...through the veil of degraded inputs, chronic ambiguity, and the occasional deliberate deception'.&lt;ref&gt;Churchland, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with such intricacies, [[R. D. Laing]] concluded that 'it is just as well that man is a social animal, since the sheer complexity and contradiction of the social field in which he has to live is so formidable'.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''The Politics of Experience'' (Penguin 1984) p. 81-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The madman, by contrast, is not 'someone to be counted on to know his place': in many ways, 'mental symptoms are wilful situational improprieties'.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 407 and p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in 'public and semi-public places - streets, shops, neighbourhoods, public transportation, and the like -...a fine mesh of obligations obtains which ensures the orderly traffic and co-mingling of participants...many classic symptoms of [[psychosis]] are precise and pointed violations of these territorial arrangements'.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] considered that 'it would be worthwhile mapping the places in social space that our culture has assigned to these [psychotic] subjects', and saw their difficulties as in part 'the effects of the breakdown produced by the symbolic discordances that characterize the complex structures of civilization':&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; what [[Goffman]] termed '"The Insanity of Place"'.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

* In ''Pride and Prejudice'', Darcy is initially riven with 'uncertainty as to whether he can bring himself to cross the great social space which, as he sees it (he is still proud), separates Elizabeth from himself'.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Tanner, "Introduction", ''Jane Austen: Pride and Prejudice'' (Penguin 1972) p. 33-4&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 'postmodern art...a [[cubist]] painting presents multiple perspectives simultaneously,fracturing "space" and literally requiring any single spectator to be in several different places at once...this postmodern crisis of subjectivity'.&lt;ref&gt;Ermath p. 107-8&lt;/ref&gt;
* 'Lefebvre suggests that art may come to be defined "less as a code of space than as a code of representational spaces"'&lt;ref&gt;Smethurst, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; - 'the space of representations and the representation of space...a ''mental space'' '&lt;ref name="Lefebvre225"/&gt; which both reflects and interacts with social space.

'''''The Travelling Artist''''' is an art house production inspired by [[German Expressionism|German expressionism]] co-directed by Jez Blackmore and Richard Hulse from a screenplay by Jenni Grant.

== Plot ==

A dark fairytale combining the drama of modern horror with classic elements of Gothic imagery inspired by the German Expressionist films of the 1920s.

A young artist, Lucy Snow, struggles bravely to cope with more than one grief; the plight of her seriously ill mother, and her own faltering talents as a painter.

Her dreams become haunted by a shadowy figure, the mythical Travelling Artist. This lonely wanderer, it’s whispered, has roamed the world for over a century in pursuit of his creative visions. Can such a man exist? And if he does, will his powers be able to rescue Lucy from sadness and what form will salvation take?

== Cast ==

* Holly- Marie Laurence as Lucy Snow
* Simon Baker as The Travelling Artist
* Poppy Flanagan as Lucy's mother
* Martine Sherlock as Eliza Rose

== Influences ==

''The Travelling Artist'' is a modern take on classic German expressionist films including ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari]]'' (1920), ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), and ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922).
