      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2552">The '''First Soviet Antarctic Expedition''' was led by [[Mikhail Somov]]; his scientific deputy was V. G. Kort. The expedition lasted from 30 November 1955 to 1957 and involved 127 expedition members and 75 crew members.

Three [[diesel-electric]] ships were used to transport the expedition. They were RV "Ob" (flagship; captain I. A. Man), RV "Lena" (captain A. I. Vetrov) and the refrigerator ship No. 7 (captain M. A. Tsygankov). The final ship was used only for transporting perishables. Ob and Lena were icebreakers 130m long and displacing 12,600 tons.

On the 30 November 1955 the first ship ("Ob") left port at [[Kaliningrad]].

The principal task of the expedition was to organise the main base, [[Mirny Station|Mirny]], and perform limited scientific observations. Other tasks were reconnaissance of sites for the inland bases [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] and [[Sovetskaya (Antarctic Research Station)|Sovetskaya]]; and oceanography of the [[Indian ocean]].

The '''28th Soviet Antarctic Expedition''' was an expedition to [[Antarctica]] undertaken by the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[German Democratic Republic]].

Although the GDR could not build a research station as a result of not having signed the [[Antarctic Treaty]], it operated a research station near the Soviet [[Novolazarevskaya]] station.

In 1983, six Germans joined the ''28th Soviet Antarctic Expedition''' to research [[meteorology]], physics of the upper atmosphere, [[geology]] and [[geophysics]].

'''Ai FM''' (Chinese name: 爱 FM, literally "Love FM"), is the national [[Chinese language|Chinese]] radio station operated by [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia]] since 1934. It is broadcast 24 hours a day (starting in 1995), 7 days a week.

== History ==
The radio station's history began as early as 1934, which was before the Second World War and the establishment of the-then Radio Malaya. It was called '''ZHj Penang'''. Radio Malaya itself was established 12 years later. After its establishment, the radio station become '''Perkhidmatan Bahasa Cina''' (''Chinese Language Service''), which goes by the name '''Rangkaian Hijau''' (''Green Network''). National radio broadcast from Angkasapuri starts on 9 May 1972. The name changed in 1993 to Radio 5 and Radio Malaysia Channel 5 in 1998. The Malay name, '''Saluran 5''' (''Channel 5'') is used for short time. It is the oldest Malaysian Chinese-language radio station, and also Malaysia's only Chinese radio station until 1996, [[988 FM]] began broadcasting as a trilingual radio station. The latter changed into a full-fledged Chinese-language radio station. The current name is used since April 2005, due to [[rebranding]] of RTM's radio stations.

== Shows ==

Ai FM consists of five slots from Monday to Friday, and four slots on Saturday and Sunday. On 6 am every day, [[national anthem]], "[[Negaraku]]" will play as the opening.

'''Andorra''' took part in the '''Eurovision Song Contest''' for the first time in 2004. The country was represented by [[Marta Roure]] and the song "Jugarem a estimar-nos". The song was chosen through a national final, ''12 Punts'' (English: ''12 Points''), which was jointly organized by Andorran broadcaster [[Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra]] (RTVA) and [[Catalonia|Catalan]] broadcaster [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv3.cat/12punts/ |title=12 Punts |publisher=TV3.cat |accessdate=24 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510172628/http://www.tv3.cat/12punts/ |archivedate=10 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 12 Punts ==
The Andorran National Final was held on 15 March 2004, hosted by Pati Molné and Xavier Graset, with the winner being chosen by a mixture of an "expert" jury (5/7), SMS voting in Andorra (1/7) and SMS voting in [[Catalonia]] (1/7). 

Before the final, 40 artists of the tiny country of Andorra attended auditions, after which two acts were selected for the televised series, [[Marta Roure]] and Bis a Bis. The series consisted of six quarter-finals, two semi-finals and the grand final. In each of the quarter-finals, 2 songs were presented with one being eliminated. In the 2 semi-finals, 3 of the winning songs from the 6 quarter-finals were presented, with one going forward to the final. The two finalist songs were performed by both Marta Roure and Bis a Bis. Marta Roure won the final by 5 votes to 2. [[Marta Roure]] was a clear favourite.

On 1 January 2004, an album of all the songs performed during the series was released on CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id%3D262075704%26s%3D143444 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104010114/https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=262075704&amp;s=143444 |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these songs, "No És Nou", became a hit later in 2006 by Catalan rock group [[Gossos]] featuring [[Beth (singer)|Beth]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29914">Formerly known as the '''World Life Issues on Environment and Development''' (WCED), the mission of the '''Brundtland Commission''' is to unite countries to pursue [[sustainable development]] together. The Chairperson of the Commission, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], was appointed by [[United Nations]] [[UNSG|Secretary-General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] in December 1983. At the time, the [[UN General Assembly]] realized that there was a heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources. To rally countries to work and pursue sustainable development together, the UN decided to establish the '''Brundtland Commission'''. Gro Harlem Brundtland was the former [[Prime Minister of Norway]] and was chosen due to her strong background in the sciences and [[public health]]. The Brundtland Commission officially dissolved in December 1987 after releasing ''[[Our Common Future]]'', also known as the ''[[Our Common Future|Brundtland Report]]'', in October 1987. The document popularized (and defined) the term 
"[[Sustainable Development]]". ''[[Our Common Future]]'' won the [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=grawemeyer.org&gt;{{cite web|title=1991- The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development|url=http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103112536/http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|archivedate=2013-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization Center for Our Common Future was started in April 1988 to take the place of the Commission.

==History==
Ten years after the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], a number of global environmental challenges had clearly not been adequately addressed.  In several ways, these challenges had grown. Particularly, the underlying problem of how to reduce poverty in low-income countries through more productive and industrialized economy without, in the process, exacerbating the global and local environmental burdens, remained unresolved. Neither high-income countries in the North nor low-income countries in the South were willing to give up an economic development based on growth, but environmental threats, ranging from pollution, acid rain, deforestation and desertification, the destruction of the ozone layer, to early signs of climate change, were impossible to overlook and increasingly unacceptable. There was a tangible need for a developmental concept that would allow reconciling economic development with [[environmental protection]]. Views differed on several questions: were local environmental problems the result of local developments or of a global economic system that forced particularly low-income countries to destroy their environmental basis? Did environmental burdens result mainly from destructive economic growth-based development or from a lack of economic development and modernization? Would reconciling the economy and the environment require mainly technical means by using more resource-efficient technologies or mainly social and structural changes that would include political decision-making as well as changes in private consumption patterns?
The 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]], was the first report that included a very brief chapter on a concept called "sustainable development". It focused on global structural changes and was not widely read. The UN initiated an independent commission, which was asked to provide an analysis of existing problems and ideas for their solution, similar to earlier commissions such as the Independent Commission on International Development Issues (Brandt Commission) and the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues (Palme Commission).&lt;ref&gt;Iris Borowy, Defining Sustainable Development: the World Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland Commission), Milton Park: earthscan/Routledge, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1983, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], asked the Prime Minister of Norway, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], to create an organization independent of the UN to focus on environmental and developmental problems and solutions after an affirmation by the General Assembly resolution in the fall of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|title=History of Sustainability&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=epa.gov|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230314/http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new organization was the Brundtland Commission, or more formally, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED). The Brundtland Commission was first headed by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] as Chairman and [[Mansour Khalid]] as Vice-Chairman.

The organization aimed to create a united international community with shared sustainability goals by identifying sustainability problems worldwide, raising awareness about them, and suggesting the implementation of solutions. In 1987, the Brundtland Commission published the first volume of “[[Our Common Future]],” the organization’s main report. “[[Our Common Future]]” strongly influenced the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 and the third UN Conference on Environment and Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002. Also, it is credited with crafting the most prevalent definition of sustainability, as seen below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623004236/http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 June 2010|title=This Norwegian's past may connect with your future|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events before Brundtland===

During the 1980s it had been revealed that the [[World Bank]] had started to experience an expanded role in intervening with the economic and social policies of the [[Third World]]. This was most notable through the events at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] in 1945. The ideas of [[neoliberalism]] and the institutions promoting [[economic globalization]] dominated the political agenda of the world's then leading trading nations: the United States under President [[Ronald Reagan]] and the United Kingdom under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], both classical liberals.

These events led into an era of [[free market]]s built on a distortion of the international order forged in 1945 at Bretton Woods. Bretton Woods was transformed through the 1980s and 1990s, finally ending in 1995 with the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]] ushered in by United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Bretton Woods was formed as an arrangement among the industrialized nation states, but was transformed into a global regime of ostensibly free markets that privileged [[multinational corporations]] and actually undermined the [[sovereignty]] of the very national communities that established Bretton Woods.

The Brundtland Report was intended as a response to the conflict between the nascent order promoting globalized economic growth and the accelerating ecological degradation occurring on a global scale. The challenge posed in the 1980s was to harmonize prosperity with ecology. This postulated finding the means to continue economic growth without undue harm to the environment. To address the urgent needs of developing countries (Third World), the United Nations saw a need to strike a better balance of human and environmental well-being. This was to be achieved by redefining the concepts of "economic development" as the new idea of "sustainable development" - as it was called in the Brundtland Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|title=ProfWork / PreludeToBrundtland|work=pbworks.com|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118221135/http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand this paradigm shift, we start with the meaning of the key term: development

===Resolution establishing the Commission===

The 1983 [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] passed Resolution 38/161 "Process of preparation of the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond", establishing the Commission.&lt;ref name="estabRes"/&gt; In A/RES/38/161, the General Assembly:

:"8. Suggests that the Special Commission, when established, should focus mainly on the following terms of reference for its work:

::(a) To propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development to the year 2000 and beyond;

::(b) To recommend ways in which concern for the environment may be translated into greater co-operation among developing countries and between countries at different stages of economic and social development and lead to the achievement of common and mutually supportive objectives which take account of the interrelationships between people, resources, environment and development;

::(c) To consider ways and means by which the international community can deal more effectively with environmental concerns, in the light of the other recommendations in its report;

::(d) To help to define shared perceptions of long-term environmental issues and of the appropriate efforts needed to deal successfully with the problems of protecting and enhancing the environment, a long-term agenda for action during the coming decades, and aspirational goals for the world community, taking into account the relevant resolutions of the session of a special character of the Governing Council in 1982;"&lt;ref name="estabRes"&gt;United Nations. 1983.

==Modern definition of sustainable development==
{{Main|Sustainable development}}
The Brundtland Commission draws upon several notions in its definition of [[sustainable development]], which is the most frequently cited definition of the concept to date.

A key element in the definition is the unity of environment and development. The Brundtland Commission argues against the assertions of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and provides an alternative perspective on sustainable development, unique from that of the 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The Brundtland Commission pushed for the idea that while the "environment" was previously perceived as a sphere separate from human emotion or action, and while "development" was a term habitually used to describe political goals or economic progress, it is more comprehensive to understand the two terms in relation to each other (We can better understand the environment in relation to development and we can better understand development in relation to the environment, because they cannot and should not be distinguished as separate entities). Brundtland argues:

"...the "environment" is where we live; and "development" is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable."

The Brundtland Commission insists upon the environment being something beyond physicality, going beyond that traditional school of thought to include social and political atmospheres and circumstances. It also insists that development is not just about how poor countries can ameliorate their situation, but what the entire world, including developed countries, can do to ameliorate our common situation.

The term sustainable development was coined in the paper ''Our Common Future'', released by the Brundtland Commission.
Sustainable development is the kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The two key concepts of sustainable development are:
• the concept of "needs" in particular the essential needs of the world's poorest people, to which they should be given overriding priority; and
• the idea of limitations which is imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet both present and future needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|title=Environment Magazine - What Is Sustainable Development? Goals, Indicators, Values, and Practice|first=Environment Magazine - Taylor and|last=Francis|work=environmentmagazine.org|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118214557/http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agree that the central idea of the Brundtland Commission's definition of "sustainable development" is that of intergenerational equity. In sum, the "needs" are basic and essential, economic growth will facilitate their fulfillment, and equity is encouraged by citizen participation. Therefore, another characteristic that really sets this definition apart from others is the element of humanity that the Brundtland Commission integrates.

The particular ambiguity and openness-to-interpretation of this definition has allowed for widespread support from diverse efforts, groups and organizations. However, this has also been a criticism; perceived by some notable commentators as "self-defeating and compromised rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;Manns, .J., "Beyond Brudtland's Compromise", Town &amp; Country Planning, August 2010, pp.337-340 {{cite web |url=http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416182659/http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |archivedate=2015-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It nonetheless lays out a core set of guiding principles that can be enriched by an evolving global discourse. As a result of the work of the Brundtland Commission, the issue of sustainable development is on the agenda of numerous international and national institutions, as well as corporations and city efforts. The definition gave light to new perspectives on the sustainability of an ever-changing planet with an ever-changing population.

-Brundtland commission
(Our Common Future)
The Report of the Brundtland Commission, Our Common Future, was published by Oxford University Press in 1987, and was welcomed by the General Assembly Resolution 42/187. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, General Assembly Resolution 42/187, 11 December 1987. One version with links to cited documents Our Common Future, Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987. Published as Annex to General Assembly document A/42/427, Development and International Co-operation is available.

The document was the culmination of a “900-day” international-exercise which catalogued, analysed, and synthesised written submissions and expert testimony from “senior government representatives, scientists and experts, research institutes, industrialists, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and the general public” held at public hearings throughout the world.

The Brundtland Commission's mandate was to: “[1] re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative, concrete, and realistic action proposals to deal with them; [2] strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change; and [3] raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, and governments” (1987: 347). “The Commission focused its attention on the areas of population, food security, the loss of species and genetic resources, energy, industry, and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another” (1987: 27).

The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed. As such, the Report offered “the analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development” within such societies (1987:16). However, the Report was unable to identify the mode(s) of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment, and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth, the Report postulated that such growth could be reformed and expanded; this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development.

The report deals with sustainable development and the change of politics needed for achieving it. The definition of this term in the report is quite well known and often cited:

:"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". It contains two key concepts:
:*the concept of "needs", in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and
:*the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs."

==Structure==
The Brundtland Commission was chaired by former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. Politicians, civil servants, and environmental experts make up the majority of the members. Members of the commission represent 21 different nations (both developed and developing countries are included). Many of the members are important political figures in their home country. One example is [[William Ruckelshaus]], former head of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. All members of the commission were appointed by both Gro Harlem Brundtland and [[Mansour Khalid]], the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

The commission focuses on setting up networks to promote environmental stewardship. Most of these networks make connections between governments and non-government entities. One such network is Bill Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development. In this council government and business leaders come together to share ideas on how to encourage sustainable development. The Brundtland Commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporations. The 1992 and 2002 [[Earth Summit]]s were the direct result of the Brundtland Commission. The international structure and scope of the Brundtland Commission allow multiple problems (such as [[deforestation]] and [[ozone depletion]]) to be looked at from a holistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=17 April 2012|website=archive.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417131934/http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability efforts==
The three main pillars of sustainable development include economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality. While many people agree that each of these three ideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainability, it is difficult to find evidence of equal levels of initiatives for the three pillars in countries' policies worldwide. With the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development, it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffering, especially with the overall well being of the environment in a dangerously unhealthy state. The Brundtland Commission has put forth a conceptual framework that many nations agree with and want to try to make a difference with in their countries, but it has been difficult to change these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs. Implementing sustainable development globally is still a challenge, but because of the Brundtland Commission's efforts, progress has been made. After releasing their report, ''Our Common Future'', the Brundtland Commission called for an international meeting to take place where more concrete initiatives and goals could be mapped out. This meeting was held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. A comprehensive plan of action, known as [[Agenda&amp;nbsp;21]], came out of the meeting. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 entailed actions to be taken globally, nationally, and locally in order to make life on Earth more sustainable going into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405221844/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=5 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic Growth===
Economic Growth is the pillar that most groups focus on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development. In trying to build their economies, many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction, which leads to unsustainable efforts for environmental protection as well as economic growth sustainability. While the Commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase in the future. So much of the natural world has already been converted into human use that the focus cannot simply remain on economic growth and omit the ever-growing problem of environmental sustainability. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 reinforces the importance of finding ways to generate economic growth without hurting the environment. Through various trade negotiations such as improving access to markets for exports of developing countries, Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 looks to increase economic growth sustainability in countries that need it most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408182141/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=8 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Protection===
Environmental Protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20&amp;nbsp;years, leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies. For the second year in a row in 2010, the United States and Europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. In 2011 the efforts continue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning in 25 different states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118220031/http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on environmental protection has transpired globally as well, including a great deal of investment in renewable energy power capacity. Eco-city development occurring around the world helps to develop and implement water conservation, smart grids with renewable energy sources, LED street lights and energy efficient building. The consumption gap remains, consisting of the fact that "roughly 80 percent of the natural resources used each year are consumed by about 20 percent of the world's population". This level is striking and still needs to be addressed now and throughout the future.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321094820/http://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Equality===
The Social Equality and Equity as pillars of sustainable development focus on the social well-being of people. The growing gap between incomes of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle - or lower-class households.This is attributed partly to the land distribution patterns in rural areas where majority live from land. Global inequality has been declining, but the world is still extremely unequal, with the richest 1% of the world’s population owning 40% of the world’s wealth and the poorest 50% owning around 1%. The Brundtland Commission made a significant impact trying to link environment and development and thus, go away from the idea of environmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake. The Commission has thus reduced the number of people living on less than a dollar a day to just half of what it used to be, as many can approach the environment and use it.These achievements can also be attributed to economic growth in [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

'''CRY 104.0FM''' is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[radio station]] based in [[Youghal]], [[County Cork]].

Areas served by the station include [[Youghal]], Ballymacoda, Ballycotton, Killeagh, Inch, Ardmore, [[Clashmore]], [[Aglish]] and Knockanore.

== History ==
Having operated as a "[[Pirate radio|pirate]]" station from 1979 to 1988, CRY was granted a community broadcasting licence in 1995 to cover Youghal's surrounding areas in East Cork and West Waterford. It was one of a very limited number nationwide of what were initially trial community licences, and followed much political lobbying in the early 1990s for the station to return with a licence. The appointment of Youghal native [[Christy Cooney]] to the then IRTC - Independent Radio and Television Commission, was a significant move in the process to get C.R.Y. back on the air with a community radio licence.

CRY reappeared on the airwaves in September 1995 on 105.1FM, originally with weekday broadcasting hours of 14:00 to 18:00, consisting of a two-hour music and sport show from 14:00-16:00, community and women's programming from 16:00-16:30.

The day's broadcasting was rounded off with "Youghal In Focus", a 90-minute news and current affairs show, which on Mondays and Fridays signed off at 17:00 for the sports programme "Sportsline".

Hourly local news bulletins also ran on weekdays for the station's first three years on air, compiled by locally based journalists.

A weekend service originally ran from 09:00 to 14:00, but within six months, weekend hours had been extended to 21:00 to take in live sport, and a relay of Saturday evening Mass.

The station flourished for many years on its original frequency, but was moved to 107.2FM in 2002 to facilitate the launch of county-wide pop station [[Red FM (Ireland)|Red FM]], and then switched to 104.0&amp;nbsp;MHz in late 2006 after suffering interference in outlying areas from a new national station, [[Newstalk]].

The changeover was completed in January 2007, after a short period of simulcasting on both the new and old frequencies, but the station went off air in October 2007 due to maintenance work on the landmark building that CRY occupies, and returned just after Christmas.

CRY's broadcasts daily from 8am to 2am on the 104fm wavelength and on http://www.cry104fm.com

== Former presenters ==
Former broadcasters on CRY who have moved onto national broadcasting include Derek Kiely, Will Downing and Oisin Langan while [[Thomas Breathnach]] moved to [[South Africa]] to work with [[Cape Town]] station [[Heart 104.9]] and now is a well known travel correspondent, writing for [[The Boston Globe]],&lt;ref&gt;ie.linkedin.com/pub/thomas-breathnach/14/459/b97&lt;/ref&gt; [[Men's Health Magazine]] &lt;ref&gt;ie.linkedin.com/pub/thomas-breathnach/14/459/b97&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Irish Independent]] &lt;ref&gt;ie.linkedin.com/pub/thomas-breathnach/14/459/b97&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1557">'''Ceux de la Résistance'''" ('''CDLR''') was a [[French resistance]] movement during the [[German occupation of France in World War II|German occupation of France]] in [[World War II]].

At first, the members of CDLR distributed copies of the underground newspaper [[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]] in the north zone of France which was directly occupied by the Germans. After several leaders of the group were arrested in 1942, [[Jacques Lecompte-Boinet]] relaunched the network and became its leader in early 1943 with the help of [[Pierre Arrighi]], a law student, and [[Jean de Voguë]], who was occupied with intelligence-gathering.

On 19 August 1944, the CDLR movement received orders to depose of the mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] in [[Paris]], Max Roger.

CDLR recruited mostly among reserve officers, engineers and industrialists. It specialised in propaganda, intelligence-gathering, and active resistance such as assisting in Allied airdrops, taking care of shot down pilots, and running arms depots.

From its creation, the leaders of the CDLR movement decided to have a strictly apolitical manner in dealing with its resistance against the occupation.

The '''Cilentana Grigia''' is an indigenous [[breed]] of [[goat|domestic goat]] from the [[province of Salerno]], in [[Campania]] in southern Italy.&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; It takes its name from the geographical region of the [[Cilento]], much of which is today within the [[Parco Nazionale del Cilento, Vallo di Diano e Alburni]], and is raised mainly in that area, but also in the [[Monti Alburni]] and the [[Monti Picentini]].&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; It is one of three indigenous goat breeds in the Cilento, the others being the [[Cilentana Fulva]] and the [[Cilentana Nera]]. The Cilentana Grigia is found on lower ground and richer pasture than the [[Cilentana Nera]], and is raised mainly for milk. The origins of the breed are obscure; it shows the influence of the [[Maltese (goat)|Maltese]] and [[Garganica]] breeds, and similarities to other Italian grey breeds such as the [[Ciociara Grigia]] of [[Lazio]] and the [[Argentata dell'Etna]] from Sicily.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt;

The Cilentana Grigia is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the [[Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia]], the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders.&lt;ref name=dm/&gt;&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt; In 2008, 768 head were registered; at the end of 2013 the registered population was 134.&lt;ref name=aspa2/&gt;

The '''debt of developing countries''' refers to the [[external debt]] incurred by governments of [[developing country|developing countries]], generally in quantities beyond the governments' ability to repay. "Unpayable debt" is external debt with interest that exceeds what the country's politicians think they can collect from taxpayers, based on the nation's [[gross domestic product]], thus preventing it from ever being repaid. The debt can result from many causes.

Some of the high levels of debt were amassed following the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Increases in oil prices forced many poorer nations' governments to borrow heavily to purchase politically essential supplies. At the same time, [[OPEC]] funds deposited and [[Petrodollar recycling|"recycled"]] through western banks provided a ready source of funds for loans. While a portion of borrowed funds went towards [[infrastructure]] and economic development financed by central governments, a portion was lost to [[Political corruption|corruption]] and about one-fifth was spent on arms.

==Debt abolition==
There is much debate about whether the richer countries should be asked for money which has to be repaid. The [[Jubilee Debt Campaign]] gives six reasons why the third world debts should be [[Debt cancellation|cancelled]]. Firstly, several governments want to spend more money on poverty reduction but they lose that money in paying off their debts. Economist [[Jeff Rubin]] agrees with this stance on the basis that the money could have been used for basic human needs and says it is [[Odious Debt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://probeinternational.org/library/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/RUBIN.pdf |title=Challenging apartheid's foreign debt |date=April 1997 |accessdate=18 January 2017 |publisher= |last=Rubin|first=Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the lenders knew that they gave to dictators or oppressive regimes and thus, they are responsible for their actions, not the people living in the countries of those regimes. For example, South Africa has been paying off $22 billion which was lent to stimulate the [[apartheid]] regime.They have yet to recover from this, their external debt has increased  to $136.6 billion while the number of people in the housing backlog has increased to 2.1 million from 1994's 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-08-01/south-africa-s-post-apartheid-failure-in-shantytowns|title = South Africa’s Post-Apartheid Failure in Shantytowns|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Brand|first = Robert|first2 = Mike|last2 = Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Guide To South Africa's Economic Bubble And Coming Crisis|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessecolombo/2014/03/19/a-guide-to-south-africas-economic-bubble-and-coming-crisis/|accessdate = 2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, many lenders knew that a great proportion of the money would sometime be stolen through corruption. Next, the developing projects that some loans would support were often unwisely led and failed because of the lender's incompetence. Also, many of the debts were signed with unfair terms, several of the loan takers have to pay the debts in foreign currency such as dollars, which make them vulnerable to world market changes. The unfair terms can make a loan extremely expensive, many of the loan takers have already paid the sum they loaned several times, but the debt grows faster than they can repay it. Finally, many of the loans were contracted illegally, not following proper processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/1%20Why%20should%20we%20drop%20the%20debt%3F+2675.twl |title=Jubilee Campaign |publisher=jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428021810/http://www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/1%20Why%20should%20we%20drop%20the%20debt%3F+2675.twl |archivedate=28 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seventh reason for canceling out some debts is that the money loaned by banks is generally created out of thin air, sometimes subject to a small capital adequacy requirement imposed by such institutions as the Bank of International Settlements. [[Maurice Félix Charles Allais]], 1988 winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, commented on this by stating: "The 'miracles' performed by credit are fundamentally comparable to the 'miracles' an association of counterfeiters could perform for its benefit by lending its forged banknotes in return for interest. In both cases, the stimulus to the economy would be the same, and the only difference is who benefits."&lt;ref&gt;The Chicago plan &amp; New Deal banking reform By Ronnie J. Phillips, 1995, M.E. Sharpe Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences of debt abolition===
Some people argue against forgiving debt on the basis that it would motivate countries to default on their debts, or to deliberately borrow more than they can afford, and that it would not prevent a recurrence of the problem. Economists refer to this as a [[moral hazard]]. It would also be difficult to determine which debt is odious. Moreover, investors could stop lending to developing countries entirely.

==Debt as a mechanism in economic crisis==
An example of debt playing a role in economic crisis was the [[Argentine economic crisis]]. During the 1980s, Argentina, like many Latin American economies, experienced [[hyperinflation]]. As a part of the process put in place to bring inflation under control, a [[fixed exchange rate]] was put into place between [[Argentina]]'s new currency and the [[US dollar]]. This guaranteed that inflation would not restart, since for every new unit of currency issued by the Argentine Central Bank, the Central Bank had to hold a US dollar against this – therefore in order to print more Argentine currency, the government required additional US dollars. Before this currency regime was in place, if the government had needed money to finance a [[Government budget deficit|budget deficit]], it could simply print more money (thus creating [[inflation]]). Under the new system, if the government spent more than it earned through taxation in a given year, it needed to cover the gap with US dollars, rather than by simply printing more money. The only way the government could get these US dollars to finance the gap was through higher tax of exporters' earnings or through borrowing the needed US dollars. A fixed exchange rate was incompatible with a structural (i.e., recurrent) budget deficit, as the government needed to borrow more US Dollars every year to finance its budget deficit, eventually leading to an unsustainable amount of US dollar debt.

Argentina's debt grew continuously during the 1990s, increasing to above US$120 billion. As a structural budget deficit continued, the government kept borrowing more, creditors continued to lend money, while the IMF suggested less state spending to stop the government's ongoing need to keep borrowing more and more. As the debt pile grew, it became increasingly clear the government's structural budget deficit was not compatible with a low inflation fixed exchange rate – either the government had to start earning as much as it spent, or it had to start (inflationary) printing of money (and thus abandoning the fixed exchange rate as it would not be able to borrow the needed amounts of US dollars to keep the exchange rate stable). Investors started to speculate that the government would never stop spending more than it earned, and so there was only one option for the government – inflation and the abandonment of the fixed exchange rate. In a similar fashion to [[Black Wednesday]], investors began to sell the Argentine currency, betting it would become worthless against the US dollar when the inevitable inflation started. This became a self-fulfilling prophecy, quickly leading to the government's US dollar reserves being exhausted. The crisis led to [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|riots in December 2001]]. In 2002, a default on about $93 billion of the debt was declared. Investment fled the country, and capital flow towards Argentina ceased almost completely.

The Argentine government met severe challenges trying to refinance the debt. Some creditors denounced the default as sheer robbery. [[Vulture fund]]s who had acquired debt bonds during the crisis, at very low prices, asked to be repaid immediately. For four years, Argentina was effectively shut out of the international financial markets.

Argentina finally got a deal by which 77% of the defaulted bonds were exchanged by others, of a much lower nominal value and at longer terms. The exchange was not accepted by the rest of the private debt holders, who continue to challenge the government to repay them a greater percentage of the money which they originally loaned. The holdouts have formed groups such as [[American Task Force Argentina]] to lobby the Argentine government, in addition to seeking redress by attempting to seize Argentine foreign reserves.

In 2016, Argentina cancelled its debt with the holdout creditors, which received returns in the order of the hundreds of percentage points.

===The determinants of external debt crises in developing countries===
Some of the major risk factors which increase the probability of the external debt crises in developing countries include high level of inflation, relatively large share of short term debt in external debt, denomination of the dept in foreign currency, decrease of the terms of trade over time, unsustainable total debt service relative to GNI, high income inequality, and high share of agriculture in GDP. At the same time, holding foreign exchange reserves is a strong protective measure against an external debt crisis&lt;ref&gt;[https://ssrn.com/abstract=3042887 "Determinants of External-Debt Crises.  A Probit Model.", Magomedova, Medeya, 2017.]
&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Recent debt relief==
39 impoverished countries {{who|date=August 2013}} have recently received partial or full cancellation of loans from foreign governments and international financial institutions, such as the IMF and World Bank.&lt;ref name=imffactsheet&gt;{{cite web|title=Debt Relief Under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative|url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/hipc.htm|website=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 April 2015|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Jubilee 2000]] banner, a coalition of groups joined together to demand debt cancellation at the [[G7]] meeting in Cologne, [[Germany]]. As a result, finance ministers of the world's wealthiest nations agreed to debt relief on loans owed by qualifying countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jubileeresearch.org/jubilee2000 jubileeresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 World Bank/IMF study found that in countries receiving debt relief, poverty reduction initiatives doubled between 1999 and 2004. [[Tanzania]] used savings to eliminate school fees, hire more teachers, and build more schools. [[Burkina Faso]] drastically reduced the cost of life-saving drugs and increased access to clean water. [[Uganda]] more than doubled school enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jubileeusa.org/jubilee.cgi?path=/learn_more&amp;page=debt_relief_works.html jubileeusa.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign, mounted in the run-up to the [[G8 Summit]] in Scotland, brought the issue of debt once again to the attention of the media and world leaders. Some have claimed that it was the [[Live 8]] concerts which were instrumental in raising the profile of the debt issue at the G8, but these were announced after the Summit pre-negotiations had essentially agreed the terms of the debt announcement made at the Summit, and so can only have been of marginal utility.  Make Poverty History, in contrast, had been running for five months prior to the Live 8 announcement and, in form of the [[Jubilee 2000]] campaign (of which Make Poverty History was essentially a re-branding) for ten years. Debt cancellation for the 18 countries qualifying under this new initiative has also brought impressive results on paper. For example, it has been reported that Zambia used savings to significantly increase its investment in health, education, and rural infrastructure. The [[fungibility]] of savings from debt service makes such claims difficult to establish. Under the terms of the G8 debt proposal, the funding sources available to [[Heavily indebted poor countries|Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) are also curtailed; some researchers have argued that the net financial benefit of the G8 proposals is negligible, even though on paper the debt burden seems temporarily alleviated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp-povertycentre.org/pub/IPCCountryStudy005.pdf undp-povertycentre.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 HIPC agreement did not wipe all debt from HIPC countries, as is stated in the article. The total debt has been reduced by two-thirds, so that their debt service obligations fall to less than 2 million&lt;!--2 million WHAT?--&gt; in one year.
While celebrating the successes of these individual countries, debt campaigners continue to advocate for the extension of the benefits of debt cancellation to all countries that require cancellation to meet basic human needs and as a matter of justice.

To assist in the reinvestment of released capital, most [[International Financial Institutions]] provide guidelines indicating probable shocks, programs to reduce a country’s vulnerability through export diversification, food buffer stocks, enhanced climate prediction methods, more flexible and reliable aid disbursement mechanisms by donors, and much higher and more rapid contingency financing. Sometimes outside experts are brought to control the country's financial institutions.

===2004 Indian Ocean earthquake===
When the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and tsunami hit, the [[G7]] announced a moratorium on debts of twelve affected nations and the [[Paris Club]] suspended loan payments of three more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/tsunami/story/0,15671,1385701,00.html guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the Paris Club met in January 2005, its 19 member-countries had pledged $3.4 billion in aid to the countries affected by the tsunami.

The debt relief for tsunami-affected nations was not universal. Sri Lanka was left with a debt of more than $8 billion and an annual debt service bill of $493 million. Indonesia retained a foreign debt of more than $132 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jubileeusa.org/take_action/Indonesiaodious.pdf |title=Odious Debt Case Studies Series: |date= |accessdate= |website=Jubilee USA Network |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222073720/http://www.jubileeusa.org/take_action/Indonesiaodious.pdf |archivedate=22 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and debt service payments to the World Bank amounted to $1.9 billion in 2006. In 2015 the total debt of Sri Lanka is $55 billion. Some of this is due to borrowing to help with infrastructure and some of it is due to corruption. The last time they sought help from the IMF was 2009, they received a $2.6 billion loan. They have yet to recover from the tsunami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sirimanne|first1=Asantha|last2=Ondaatjie|first2=Anusha|title=Sri Lanka Looks to IMF for Help as Debt Burden Climbs|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-20/sri-lanka-looks-to-imf-for-help-as-debt-burden-climbs|accessdate=6 April 2015|agency=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===G8 Summit 2005: aid to Africa and debt cancellation===
The traditional meeting of G8 finance ministers before the summit took place in [[London]] on 10 and 11 June 2005, hosted by then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]]. On 11 June, agreement was reached to write off the entire [[US dollar|US$]]40 billion debt owed by 18 [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] to the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[African Development Bank#Group entities|African Development Fund]]. The annual saving in debt payments amounts to just over US$1 billion. [[War on Want]] estimates that US$45.7 billion would be required for 62 countries to meet the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The ministers stated that twenty more countries, with an additional US$15 billion in debt, would be eligible for [[debt relief]] if they met targets on fighting [[political corruption|corruption]] and continue to fulfill [[structural adjustment]] [[conditionalities]] that eliminate impediments to [[investment]] and calls for countries to privatize industries, liberalize their economies, eliminate subsidies, and reduce budgetary expenditures. The agreement came into force in July 2006 and has been called the "Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative", MDRI.  It can be thought of as an extension of the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) initiative. This decision was heavily influenced and applauded by international development organizations like [[Jubilee 2000]] and the [[ONE Campaign]].

Opponents of debt cancellation suggested that [[structural adjustment]] policies should be continued. Structural adjustments had been criticized for years for devastating poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Structural Adjustment—a Major Cause of Poverty.| publisher=Global Issues| first=Anup| last=Shah|date=July 2007| url=http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/SAP.asp| accessdate=2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Zambia, structural adjustment reforms of the 1980s and early 1990s included massive cuts to health and education budgets, the introduction of user fees for many basic health services and for primary education, and the cutting of crucial programs such as child immunization initiatives.

====Criticism of G8 debt exceptions====
Countries that qualify for the HIPC process will only have debts to the World Bank, IMF and African Development Bank canceled. Criticism was raised over the exceptions to this agreement as Asian countries will still have to repay debt to the Asian Development Bank and Latin American countries will still have to repay debt to the [[Inter-American Development Bank]]. Between 2006 and 2010 this amounts to US$1.4 billion for the qualifying Latin American countries of Bolivia, Guyana, Honduras and Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jubileeusa.org/take_action/idbdebt06.pdf |title=Latin America's Debt and the Inter-American Development Bank |publisher=Jubilee USA Network |date=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110101152/http://www.jubileeusa.org/take_action/idbdebt06.pdf |archivedate=10 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Deixa-me sonhar (só mais uma vez)"''' ("Let me dream (just once more)") was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003]] in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[English language|English]] (although this bilingual version was never recorded) by [[Rita Guerra]]. The song was composed by [[Paulo Martins]]. This was the first time that the Portuguese entry was not fully sung in Portuguese. The song peaked at #7 in the Portuguese singles chart.

The song is a ballad, with Guerra telling her lover that he can take almost everything else when he goes, as long as he leaves her the ability to "dream one more time" and imagine that she is still in a relationship with him.

The song was performed seventh on the night, following [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s [[Mija Martina]] with "[[Ne brini]]" and preceding [[Croatia]]'s [[Claudia Beni]] with "[[Više nisam tvoja]]". At the close of voting, it had received 13 points, placing 22nd in a field of 26.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Contest]] by [[Sofia Vitória]] with "[[Foi magia]]".

The '''Democratic Renewal Party''' (''Partido Renovador Democrático'') is a [[political party]] in [[Angola]]. The party was founded on December 16, 1990. The founders of PRD had belonged to the leadership of [[MPLA]], but were exiled during the purges that followed a failed coup in 1977. The chairman of the party is Luis da Silva dos Passos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Besson|first= Emmanuelle|date=June 2002|title=Autour du procès de Joaquim Pinto de Andrade.

The PRD suffered some early setbacks. In April 1992 the then chairman of the party, Joaquim Pinto de Andrade, left it. Soon thereafter, in August of the same year, the General Secretary, Vicente Júnior, broke away.

The '''Dobberworth''' or '''Dubberworth''' is one of the largest [[Early history of Pomerania|prehistoric]] [[tumulus|tumuli]] (''[[Hügelgrab]]'') in northern [[Germany]], located on the isle of [[Rügen]] near [[Sagard]].&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;Ingrid Schmidt, ''Hünengrab und Opferstein'', Hinstorff, Rostock 2001, pp.31–33, {{ISBN|3-356-00917-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dubberworth is about {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} tall,&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt; and was made from an estimated 22,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of earth,&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt; making it the largest tumulus of Rügen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon]], [http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/A/Sagard edition of 1905 available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists were not yet able to date the tumulus precisely, but assume it was used during the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt; The etymology of the name is also uncertain, "''-worth''" is linked to an old designation for an "elevated estate" ("''Worte''", "''Wurt''").&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;

According to local legends, the Dubberworth was made by a [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] who intended to fill a narrow ford linking two nearby [[Bodden]] and lost the clay on their way.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt; In one legend, the giant was a female on her way to exact revenge on a [[prince of Rügen]] who did not love her back, in another legend it was male giant '''Scharmak''' on his way to his girl-friend.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt; A further legend tells about [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarven]] dwellers and large amounts of gold inside the hill.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;

'''Drug Action Teams''' ("DAT") are multi-agency partnerships created by the 1995 [[United Kingdom]] national drug strategy. DATs are responsible for coordinating local initiatives and programs on drug and alcohol use, and reporting how said programs support the national strategy to national public health agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|title=Drugs: Policy and Politics|date=May 1, 2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill International|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7abisgYP_1kC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=drug+action+teams+1995&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xZ_tcUujlA&amp;sig=FQYxJ8kzxk7nVo9J34235rBhIL8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TABAVNfPCc6yyASI_YCwDA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=drug%20action%20teams%201995&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Names and substances included in programming vary across the UK. In England, some DATs also have a remit for alcohol and are called '''Drug and Alcohol Action Teams''' ("DAAT"). English DATs and DAATs operate within their top level local authority (i.e. county or unitary authority). In Scotland, all DATs also have a remit for alcohol and are now called '''Alcohol and Drug Partnerships''' ("ADP"). In Wales, five Drug and Alcohol Action Teams were replaced by four Strategic Coordination Teams (“SCT”) in each of the Welsh police authority areas.

All of these agencies focus on coordinating services for their local communities. These services, according to the Bournemouth DAAT, can include: identifying important local drug misuse issues; creating local action plans and programs; designing treatment and other interventions to help people with substance abuse issues; support alcohol and drug interventions; develop and support recovery programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us: Bournemouth DAAT|url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/Microsites/DAAT/AboutUs.aspx|website=www.bournemouth.gov.uk|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of DATs changed with the arrival of [[Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership]]s (“CDRP”) in England and [[Community Safety Partnership]]s (“CSP”) in Wales in 1998. In some areas, DAT functions are carried out by the CDRP. In others, the DAT is effectively a sub-committee of the CDRP.

DATs in England are funded from various sources, including the Pooled Treatment Budget (PTB) via the [[National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse]] (NTA) and the [[Drug Interventions Programme]] via the [[Home Office]]. In 2013 the National Treatment Agency was merged into the newly formed [[Public Health England]].

[[File:MontenegroOrthodox2011.PNG|thumb|right|270px|Orthodox faith in Montenegro (2011 census).]]

'''[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]''' is one of the three main religions in '''[[Montenegro]]''', and the largest one. According to the latest census, 446,858 people (72.07%) registered as Eastern Orthodox Christians (2011). The majority of Eastern Orthodox people in Montenegro are adherents of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. A minor percentage support the uncanonical and unrecognized [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church]] which claims the property of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro.

==Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro==
Four eparchies (dioceses) of the Serbian Orthodox Church cover the territory of Montenegro, two of them being entirely within its borders, and two partially: 
* [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]], with seat in [[Cetinje]]
* [[Eparchy of Budimlja and Nikšić]], with seat in [[Nikšić]]
* [[Eparchy of Mileševa]], partially covers northwestern region of Montenegro and southwestern region of Serbia
* [[Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina]], also covers a small region of [[Sutorina]] in southwestern corner of Montenegro

Regional Council of Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro consists of all four diocesan bishops. The Council is presided by the [[Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral]]. The 17th-century [[Ostrog monastery]] is a religious landmark of Montenegro and the most popular pilgrimage site.

==2011 census==
{{see also|Demographic history of Montenegro}}
The religious structure of Montenegro, based on the 2011 census, was:
*[[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] - 446,858 (''72.07%'')
*[[Islam|Muslim]] - 118,477 (''19.11%'')
*[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] - 21,299 (''3.44%'')
*Other - 27,756 (''5.38%'')

'''Eesti Rahvusringhääling''' ('''ERR''') &amp;ndash; ''Estonian Public Broadcasting'' &amp;ndash; is a publicly funded radio and television organisation created in [[Estonia]] on 1 June 2007 to take over the functions of the formerly separate Eesti Raadio (ER) (''Estonian Radio'') and [[Eesti Televisioon]] (ETV) (''Estonian Television''), under the terms of the Estonian National Broadcasting Act. The first chair of ERR is Margus Allikmaa, the former chair of Eesti Raadio. Present CEO is Erik Roose.

The Act, which was passed by the [[Riigikogu|Estonian Parliament]] on 18 January 2007, also appointed Eesti Ringhäälingunõukogu (RHN) (''the Estonian Broadcasting Council'') to act as the regulatory body for ERR's five national radio channels and single television station.

Regular radio broadcasting in Estonia began on 18 December 1926. TV was first broadcast in Estonia on 19 July 1955. ERR receives a state grant to fund the operation of its five national radio channels and two TV channels. ERR participates in a number of projects within the [[European Broadcasting Union]], of which it is a full member, notably in musical exchanges and concert series. In addition, ERR's [[Radio drama|Radio Drama]] Department has won international recognition at events organised by the EBU.

On 19 September 2014, the Estonian government approved the creation of a dedicated Russian-language TV channel as part of the ERR network. The channel [[ETV+]] was launched in late September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.err.ee/v/politics/20715dec-af57-4c32-953b-ea2ed41f8d11 |title=Cabinet Gives the Go-Ahead for Russian-Language TV Channel |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/estonia-launches-own-russian-language-tv-channel/a-18747088|title=Estonia launches own Russian-language TV channel|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Channels==
ERR's three national television channels are:
*[[Eesti Televisioon|ETV]] &amp;ndash; a general interest TV channel
*[[ETV2]] &amp;ndash; programming for children, sports, cultural programming, i.e. quality films and drama series
*[[ETV+]] &amp;ndash; Russian-language TV channel for Russian minority

ERR's five national radio channels are: 
*[[Vikerraadio]] &amp;ndash; a full-format programme
*[[Raadio 2]] &amp;ndash; a station specializing in pop/underground music and aimed primarily at listeners aged 15–29
*[[Klassikaraadio]] &amp;ndash; recorded and live classical and folk music, jazz, and cultural programming
*[[Raadio 4]] &amp;ndash; programming for linguistic minorities, in particular Estonia's [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking community
*[[Raadio Tallinn]] &amp;ndash; news and information for foreign listeners, including elements from ERR Uudised, [[BBC World Service|BBC]] and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]].

The '''Fontana dei Dioscuri''' is the [[fountain]] set opposite the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]], the official residence of the [[President of the Italian Republic]] in the [[Piazza del Quirinale]].

The original fountain, which no longer exists, commissioned by [[Pope]] [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] in 1588, had the [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux]] statues, from [[Constantine I|Constantine I of Rome]]'s [[Thermae|Baths]], moved to the piazza, from the site, thought to have been [[Quirinal hill|nearby]], flanking it.

In the late 1780s by Antinori, was commissioned by [[Pope]] [[Pope Pius VI|Pius VI]], to make a better layout for the piazza and had the fountain and the Dioscuri moved, and included the large [[Obelisk]] which had been moved from the [[Campus Martius]] in the design.

Some time between, that original fountain was lost, and, in 1818 a new one, which can be seen today, was commissioned by [[Pope]] [[Pope Pius VII|Pius VII]] and was designed by [[Raffaele Stern]] using an ancient granite Roman shell that had been found in the 16th century supported on top of a large basin. It was sited in front of the two statues with the [[obelisk]] between them.

In 1810, the Rome-based sculptor [[Paolo Triscornia]] sent the reduced copies of the Dioscuri to [[Saint Petersburg]] for his compatriot [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]. They were put up in front of the [[Saint Petersburg Manege]] six years later.

'''''Growth in a Time of Debt''''', also known by its authors' names as '''Reinhart–Rogoff''', is an [[economics]] paper by [[United States|American]] economists [[Carmen Reinhart]] and [[Kenneth Rogoff]] published in a non peer-reviewed issue of the ''[[American Economic Review]]'' in 2010. Politicians, commentators, and activists widely cited the paper in political debates over the effectiveness of [[austerity]] in [[fiscal policy]] for debt-burdened economies.&lt;ref name=dgad&gt;{{cite news

In 2013, academic critics accused [[Carmen Reinhart|Reinhart]] and [[Kenneth Rogoff|Rogoff]] of employing methodology that suffered from 3 major errors; they asserted that the underlying data did not support the authors' conclusions. These critics held that the Reinhart-Rogoff paper had led to unjustified adoption of austerity policies for countries with various levels of [[public debt]].&lt;ref name="Interview_with_Herndon_and_Ash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economonitor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Mencinger |first=Jernej |last2=Aristovnik |first2=Aleksander |last3=Verbič |first3=Miroslav| year = 2014| title = The Impact of Growing Public Debt on Economic Growth in the European Union |journal={{Interlanguage link multi|Amfiteatru Economic|ro}} | volume = 16 |number=35 | pages =403–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/53243/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political influence==
In their critique of Reinhart and Rogoff's paper, [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] economists [[Thomas Herndon]], Michael Ash, and [[Robert Pollin]] pointed out that "Growth in a Time of Debt" was influential on the United States [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s budget proposal "[[The Path to Prosperity]]" (commonly referred to as the "[[Paul Ryan]] budget"):&lt;ref name="HAP"&gt;{{cite paper

&lt;blockquote&gt;A well-known study completed by economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart confirms this common-sense conclusion. The study found conclusive empirical evidence that gross debt (meaning all debt that a government owes, including debt held in government trust funds) exceeding 90 percent of the economy has a significant negative effect on economic growth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
RR have clearly exerted a major influence in recent years on public policy debates over the management of government debt and fiscal policy more broadly. Their findings have provided significant support for the austerity agenda that has been ascendant in Europe and the United States since 2010.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Olli Rehn]], [[EU Commissioner]] for Economic Affairs, in his address to the [[International Labour Organization]] on April 9, 2013, used the Reinhart-Rogoff paper to argue that "public debt in Europe is expected to stabilise only by 2014 and to do so at above 90% of GDP. Serious empirical research has shown that at such high levels, public debt acts as a permanent drag on growth." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

British Member of Parliament [[George Osborne]] (who became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 2010) relied on the paper to portray excess debt as the universal cause of financial crises: "As Rogoff and Reinhart demonstrate convincingly, all financial crises ultimately have their origins in one thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodological flaws==
The paper was published in an annual "Papers and Proceedings" edition of ''[[The American Economic Review]]'' that was not subject to the same [[peer-review]] standards that other editions use before publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/editor-talks-reinhart-rogoff-excel-error-2013-4 "Editor Talks Reinhart-Rogoff Excel Error"], ''Business Insider'', April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Reinhart and Rogoff (RR) did not publish the [[data sample]] upon which they based their conclusions, but they made it available upon request to Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin (HAP), who then closely examined the data used in the study.&lt;ref name="Interview_with_Herndon_and_Ash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=10099|publisher=The Real News Network|date=April 23, 2013|title=28-Year Old PhD Student Debunks the Most Influential Austerity Study|first=Paul|last=Jay}} Transcript of interview with Thomas Herndon and Michael Ash.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, HAP released a critique of the RR data analysis in the working paper "Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth? A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff", later published in the ''[[Cambridge Journal of Economics]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal
 | last1= Herndon |first1=Thomas |last2=Ash |first2=Michael |last3=Pollin |first3=Robert.
 | year = 2014
 | title =  Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth? A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff
 | journal = [[Cambridge Journal of Economics]]
 | volume = 38 |number=2 | pages = 257–279
 | doi = 10.1093/cje/bet075}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contend that the statistical analyses performed on the data in the original RR [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] spreadsheet (which were used to support the conclusions of the paper) were flawed: "While using RR's working spreadsheet, we identified coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics." Using RR's working spreadsheet, but correcting for the claimed errors, HAP found:&lt;ref name="HAP"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When properly calculated, the average real GDP growth rate for countries carrying a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not −0.1 percent as published in Reinhart and Rogoff. That is, contrary to RR, average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90 percent is not dramatically different than when debt/GDP ratios are lower.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

HAP also concluded that the sample was [[bias (statistics)|biased]], claiming that RR [[selective omission|selectively omitted]] data for Australia, Canada, and New Zealand for the early [[post-World War II]] period, which showed high growth despite large public debts, while including data for the United States for the same period that showed negative GDP growth, which Herndon attributed to demobilization of U.S. military personnel. Also, by using only one year's data for New Zealand, a negative 7.6% GDP growth in 1951, a year in which New Zealand's [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|trade suffered from a major strike]], the average [[central tendency]] of the available 5 years (1946-1949 and 1951) shifted from 2.6% to -7.6%.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Gary. Standard Deviations. page 62 {{ISBN|9781468309201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview_with_Herndon_and_Ash"/&gt;

HAP concluded that the "combination of the collapse of the empirical result that high public debt is inevitably associated with greatly reduced GDP growth and the weakness of the theoretical mechanism under current conditions, ... render the Reinhart and Rogoff point close to irrelevant for current public policy debate."&lt;ref name="Interview_with_Herndon_and_Ash"/&gt;

However, HAP's viewpoint&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; has been criticized. RR published a lengthy, detailed response to HAP in ''The New York Times'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Carmen M.|last1=Reinhart|first2=Kenneth S.|last2=Rogoff|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/17/business/17economix-response.html|title=Full Response from Reinhart and Rogoff|work=The New York Times|date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Herndon, Ash and Pollin accurately point out the coding error that omits several countries from the averages in figure 2. Full stop. HAP are on point.... HAP go on to note some other missing debt data points [New Zealand], which they describe as "selective omissions." This charge, which permeates through their paper, is one we object to in the strongest terms.... Data for New Zealand for the years around WWII had just been incorporated and we had not vetted the comparability and quality data with data for the more recent period.... They argue that we use an "unconventional weighting of summary statistics." In particular, for each bucket, we take average growth rates for each country and then take an average of the result. This seems perfectly natural to us, and hardly unconventional.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Economics professor [[L. Randall Wray]] criticized Reinhart and Rogoff for combining data "across centuries, exchange rate regimes, public and private debt, and debt denominated in foreign currency as well as domestic currency," in addition to "statistical errors," and for lacking a "theory of sovereign currency".&lt;ref name="economonitor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economonitor.com/lrwray/2013/04/20/why-reinhart-and-rogoff-results-are-crap|title=Why Reinhart and Rogoff Results are Crap|date=April 20, 2013|first=L. Randall|last=Wray|work=EconoMonitor|publisher=Roubini Global Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques point out that any correspondence between debt levels and insufficient economic growth could just as easily be reversed: it is the weak economic growth that leads to the high debt levels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dylan Matthews]], writing in the ''[[Washington Post]]'': https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/08/why-do-people-hate-deficits/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal

''Next New Deal: The Blog of the Roosevelt Institute'' - http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/guest-post-reinhartrogoff-and-growth-time-debt&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that the relationship between debt and growth varies significantly between countries, meaning that an average "rule", such as that suggested by Reinhart and Rogoff, has little meaning or policy relevance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, K; Bell, A and Johnston, R (2013) Significant variation across countries means that simple conclusions regarding growth and debt, like those offered by Reinhart &amp; Rogoff, have no policy relevance. ''LSE Politics and Policy Blog'': http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/debt-and-economic-growth-but-no-geography-a-cautionary-tale/&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel Prize-winning [[Princeton University|Princeton]] economist [[Paul Krugman]] stated in 2013:&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/krugman-the-excel-depression.html?_r=0 The Excel Depression]. ''The New York Times''. April 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;What the Reinhart-Rogoff affair shows is the extent to which austerity has been sold on false pretenses. For three years, the turn to austerity has been presented not as a choice but as a necessity. Economic research, austerity advocates insisted, showed that terrible things happen once debt exceeds 90 percent of G.D.P. But "economic research" showed no such thing; a couple of economists made that assertion, while many others disagreed. Policy makers abandoned the unemployed and turned to austerity because they wanted to, not because they had to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2017, Maziarz argued that the controversy is an example of an ‘emerging contrary/recalcitrant result’ phenomenon,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maziarz|first=Mariusz|date=2017-03-16|title=The Reinhart-Rogoff controversy as an instance of the ‘emerging contrary result’ phenomenon|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1350178X.2017.1302598|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|volume=0|pages=1–13|doi=10.1080/1350178X.2017.1302598|issn=1350-178X}}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept coined by Robert Goldfarb,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldfarb|first=Robert S.|date=1997-12-01|title=Now you see it, now you don't: emerging contrary results in economics|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501789700000016|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|volume=4|issue=2|pages=221–244|doi=10.1080/13501789700000016|issn=1350-178X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldfarb|first=Robert S.|date=1995-12-01|title=The economist-as-audience needs a methodology of plausible inference|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501789500000015|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|volume=2|issue=2|pages=201–222|doi=10.1080/13501789500000015|issn=1350-178X}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has stated that empirical controversies are a common feature of macroeconomics. Maziarz emphasized that the spreadsheet error had limited influence on the 2.3% GDP growth difference in the total estimates by RR and HAP, being only up to a maximum of 0.3% in comparison to data exclusions, which accounted for up to 1.4%, and the weighting scheme choice, which accounted for up to 1.7% of the 2.3% difference. Maziarz contended that neither of the two averaging schemes, whether that employed by RR or the alternative by HAP, is clearly methodologically superior&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://econbrowser.com/archives/2013/04/reinhartrogoff|title=Reinhart-Rogoff data problems {{!}} Econbrowser|last=Hamilton|first=James|date=21 April 2013|website=econbrowser.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to invoke submission/publication bias.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Isku-dheh karis''' is a Somali rice dish consisting of a mix of meat pieces, rice andsome vegetables. The term literally means "cooked mixed together", therefore it is sometimes used to more broadly refer to other grain-derived crops that require similar cooking. Hence the more specific term for this dish is '''bariis isku dheh karis'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacob|first1=Jeanne|title=The World Cookbook for Students|date=2006|page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be served with various meats including chicken, mutton, fish or camel meat. Some Somali restaurants serve it with a banana. This rice dish is often served from a clay pot called ''baris dhari'', which serves to impart flavor from food cooked in metal pots.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Customs of Somalia

It was multilingual, containing articles in the mutually intelligible languages Swedish, Danish and Norwegian according to the subject matter and preferences of the authors. The work was published in twenty-two volumes over the period 1956–1978 by the publisher Allhem ([[Malmö]]) and edited by [[Ingvar Andersson]] (1899-1974) and [[John Granlund]] (1901-1982).

==Synopsis==
In the desert [[savannah]], Kodou and Tano meet [[Ayoka]], the caretaker of a century old tree that a contractor wants to cut down. Kodou, guided by Ayoka, seeks his ancestors to ask for their help. Tano stays at the tree to protect it. But the ancestors can only advise him, the children must find the solution themselves. They discover that the gigantic [[Adansonia digitata|baobab]] is a door between two worlds. The spirit of the [[rain]], trapped by the spirit of the [[drought]], can't come back to Earth. Without the sacred baobab, the road to Earth will remain closed forever and nature's balance will be shattered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3309">The '''Porto Alegre Manifesto''' is a proposal for social change produced at the [[2005 World Social Forum]].  It outlines "twelve... proposals, which [its authors] believe, together, give sense and direction to the construction of another, different world."  The authors argue that "if they would be implemented, it would allow citizens to take back their own future. We therefore want to submit these fundamentals points to the scrutiny of actors and social movements of all countries."  These proposals are divided into Economic Measures, Peace and Justice, and Democracy.

==Summary of twelve proposals==

===Economic measures===

1. [[Debt relief|Debt cancellation]] for southern countries.

2. Implement international tax on financial transactions, i.e., [[Tobin tax]].

3. Dismantle all [[tax haven]]s and [[corporate haven]]s (described as "paradises").

4. Universal right to employment, social protection and pensions.

5. Promote [[fair trade]] and reject all [[free trade]] agreements and [[World Trade Organization]] laws, emphasizing the importance of education, health, [[social services]] and [[cultural rights]] over [[commercial rights]].

6. Guarantee of [[food security]] to all countries by promoting rural, peasant [[agriculture]].

7. Outlaw patenting of knowledge on living things and [[privatization]] of "common goods for humanity", i.e., water.

===Peace and justice===

8. Use [[public policy|public policies]] to fight [[discrimination]], [[sexism]], [[xenophobia]], [[antisemitism]] and [[racism]] and fully recognize the political, cultural and economic rights of indigenous peoples.

9. Take steps to end environmental destruction and the [[greenhouse effect]] using alternative [[Economic development|development]] models.

10. Dismantle all foreign [[military bases]] and the removal of troops from all countries except those under the explicit mandate of the [[United Nations]].

===Democracy===

11. Guarantee the right to information and the right to inform through legislation that would end [[concentration of media ownership]], guarantee the autonomy of journalists, and favor [[alternative media]].

12. Reform international institutions based on the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and incorporate the [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]] and WTO into the United Nations. 

==Signatories==

The signatures of the manifesto (so-called "Group of Nineteen") are [[Aminata Traoré]], [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]], [[Eduardo Galeano]], [[José Saramago]], [[François Houtart]], [[Boaventura de Sousa Santos]], [[Armand Mattelart]], [[Roberto Savio]], [[Riccardo Petrella]], [[Ignacio Ramonet]], [[Bernard Cassen]], [[Samir Amin]], [[Atilio Borón]], [[Samuel Ruiz García]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Frei Betto]], [[Emir Sader]], [[Walden Bello]], and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2487">The '''Regional Positioning and Timing System''' ({{lang-tr|Bölgesel Konumlama ve Zamanlama Sistemi}}), shortly '''BKZS''', is a space-based project of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] on [[global positioning]] and [[time transfer]] by [[satellite navigation system]]. 

The aim of the project is to provide positioning and timing information, which Turkish Armed Forces need during peace, crisis and [[military operation]]s, independently from the existing foreign systems, which can be disabled in times of conflict.&lt;ref name="st1"/&gt; The project is developed by the Defence Technologies and Engineering Inc. (Savunma Teknolojileri ve Mühendislik A.Ş.) (STM), a subsidiary of the Undersecretariat for Defence Industries. Currently, the project is in the first phase, comprising evaluation of the feasibility study.&lt;ref name="ssm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ssm2"/&gt; It is planned to launch five military [[reconnaissance satellite|reconnaissance]] and [[Earth observation satellite]]s over the next few years.&lt;ref name="mc1"/&gt;

The '''Diocese of Deventer''' is a [[Religious intolerance| suppressed]] [[diocese]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in the current [[Netherlands]]. It was erected in 1559 as a suffragan see to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht|Diocese of Utrecht]], which was raised to an Archdiocese at the same time, at the request of king [[Philip II of Spain]]. The Diocese of [[Deventer]] covered [[Overijssel]], a part of [[Guelders]], and the counties of [[County of Zutphen|Zutphen]], [[County of Bentheim|Bentheim]], and [[County of Lingen|Lingen]].

According to the 19th-century historian A.J. van der Aa,&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{vanderAa-AW|D|269||PA268&amp;id{{=}}RX0IAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first bishop appointed by Philip II was [[Johannes Mahusius]], but he never occupied the post because of obstruction by the Estates, and he resigned in 1570 because of illness. He was succeeded by [[Egidius de Monte]], who was established in [[Deventer]] by the [[Duke of Alva]]. After he died in 1589, [[Gijsbert Koeverinks]] was named as the third bishop of Deventer, but before he could be consecrated in 1591, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange]] conquered the city, and the diocese ceased to exist.

Saint [[Lebuïnuskerk, Deventer| Lebuinus Church]] served as the cathedral of the Diocese of Deventer. It was later taken in the revolt by the [[Calvinists]]. Today it is a Protestant church and is commonly known as the "Grote Kerk" (Great Church). It is located in the old town center in the market square along the IJssel River.

{{nobr|There is a long}} history of '''terrorism in Europe'''. This has often been linked to nationalist and separatist movements, while other acts have been related to political extremism (including anarchism, far-right and far-left extremism), or religious extremism.

==History==
===Definitions===
Defining terrorism is difficult, and there are more than one hundred definitions of it in scholarly literature. The term is used in polemical contexts, thus it can become a move in a campaign rather than an aid to thought.&lt;ref name="O'KeefeCoady2002"&gt;{{cite book |author1= Michael O'Keefe |author2=C.A.J. Coady |title= Terrorism and Justice: Moral Argument in a Threatened World |year=2002 |publisher= Melbourne Univ. Publishing |isbn= 978-0-522-85049-9 |p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple definition would be "use of force against innocent people for political purposes". Some scholars argue that there is no true or correct definition due to terrorism being an abstract concept without a real presence. Legal definitions contain internal contradictions and might be misused.&lt;ref name="White2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jonathan R.

Baev, ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', '''19'''(2), 247-268. doi:10.1080/09546550701246965&lt;/ref&gt; or non-international armed conflicts. This is the case with several significant non-international conflicts in Europe, where there thus can be dispute as to what counts as terrorism: examples include the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–21), the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and subsequent conflicts,&lt;ref&gt;"Approaches to political violence and terrorism in former Yugoslavia 1" by Florian Bieber, ''Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans'' 2003, '''5'''(1): 39-51&lt;/ref&gt; the [[First Chechen War|First]] (1994–6) and [[Second Chechen War]]s (1999–2009), and the [[War of Dagestan]] (1999).

===Early history===
In the Middle Ages, maritime nations in Europe sponsored [[Piracy#Europe and North Africa|pirates]] and privateering against rivals.&lt;ref&gt;"West European Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism: The Evolving Dynamic" by P Chalk. 1996: Macmillan Press Ltd. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The term "terror" is used about the [[reign of terror]] in France, carried out by the [[Jacobins]], 1792-4.

{{Terrorism}}
Terrorism in Europe around the beginning of the twentieth century was often associated with [[anarchist terrorism|anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al Qaeda'' by Gérard Chaliand &amp; Arnaud Blin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Richard Jensen, "Daggers, rifles and dynamite: Anarchist terrorism in nineteenth century Europe." ''Terrorism and Political Violence'' 2004, '''16'''(1):116-53&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism within the [[European Communities]] since 1951 has often been linked to separatist movements, including the [[Irish Republican Army]] within the United Kingdom, and [[Euskadi Ta Askatasuna]] within Spain. Other perpetrators have been linked to far-right and far-left extremism, environmental extremism and anarchism. Since 2001, there has been an increase in attacks linked to extremist Islamist groups, particularly in France. Many separatist terrorist activities also have a religious angle, as, for example, with Chechen separatism in [[Russia]]. The internationally co-ordinated element has seen increasing attempts by governments to seek to weaken extremist ideology, particularly [[Islamic extremism]].

It remains the case that the majority of deaths from terrorism do not occur in the "[[Western world|West]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalterrorismindex.org/|title=Global Terrorism Index 2017 {{!}}|last=|first=|date=|website=globalterrorismindex.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22|quote=Just five countries account for three quarters of all deaths from terrorism: Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria and Pakistan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Al Qaeda attacks against the United States in 2001 are excluded, only 0.5% of all deaths from terrorism have occurred in Western countries &amp;ndash; European nations, United States, Canada and Australia &amp;ndash; in the years 2000-14.&lt;ref name="Global Terrorism Index page 2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Terrorism Index: Measuring and Understanding the Impact of Terrorism|url=http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2015.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2016|publisher=''Institute for Economics and Peace''}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been recent increases in the number of high-fatality attacks. There had been a decrease in the number of overall fatalities from terrorist attacks between 1990 and 2015, compared to those between 1970 and 1990.&lt;ref name="World Economic Forum"&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Terrorism in Europe at a Historical High?|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/03/terrorism-in-europe-at-historical-high/|accessdate=13 August 2016|publisher=''World Economic Forum''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1990, on average 150 people died each year from terrorist attacks; this figure would be even higher if the large number of people who died in 1988 from the Pan Am 2013 bombing were included. From 1990, an average of a little under 50 people died each year. However, this figure has begun to increase again from 2011, with the attacks by far-right extremist Anders Breivik in Norway, and Islamist extremist attacks in France in 2015 and 2016.

[[Europol]] has published an annual trend report on terrorist attacks (including failed, foiled, and completed attacks) and terrorist related arrests in the EU since 2006.&lt;ref name="Europol statistics"&gt;{{citation |title=Europol statistics|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/latest_publications/37|accessdate=15 January 2015|publisher=''europol.europa.eu''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports identify that perpetrators' known or suspected affiliations have been disparate in nature. Europol break these down into five categories: [[jihadist terrorism]] (previously termed "religiously-inspired terrorism"); [[Nationalist terrorism|ethno-nationalist and separatist terrorism]]; [[Left-wing terrorism|left-wing and anarchist terrorism]]; [[right-wing terrorism]]; and [[Special-interest terrorism|single-issue terrorism]]. Europol's reports do not provide a breakdown of the proportion of attacks that have been completed or the type of damage inflicted. According to these data the vast majority of terrorist attacks in the EU between 2006 and 2013 are affiliated with ethno-national or separatist motives, followed by left-wing attacks and those that are registered as 'unspecified'. A significant number of terror attacks are motivated religiously or associated with right-wing groups. However, among those arrested on terror-related crimes most are religiously motivated and form the largest group, followed by separatist related terror suspects.

In 2015, a total of 211 completed, failed, or foiled terrorist attacks were reported by EU states, resulting in 151 fatalities (of which 148 were in France, with 130 of them occurring during the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]]) and over 360 people injured. As in previous years, separatist attacks accounted for the largest proportion (65), followed by jihadist attacks (17). The latter, however, caused the largest number of fatalities (150) and injuries (250). The United Kingdom reported the largest number of attacks (103), but did not provide statistics on suspected affiliation.&lt;ref name="Europol statistics2015"&gt;{{citation |title=European Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 2016|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/european-union-terrorism-situation-and-trend-report-te-sat-2016|accessdate=13 August 2016|publisher=''europol.europa.eu''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tackling jihadist terrorism threats has become an over-riding priority for security services, although many commentators express concerns that the risk of far-right terrorism is currently being underestimated.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 29 Feb 2016"&gt;{{citation |title=Focus on Islamist terror plots overlooks threat from far right – report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/29/focus-on-islamist-terror-plots-overlooks-threat-from-far-right-report|accessdate=13 August 2016|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, British intelligence [[MI5]] said that [[Northern Ireland]] is the most concentrated area of terrorist activity "probably anywhere in Europe", with weekly threats from dissident Irish republicans.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/m15-terror-threat-ireland-greatest-11734711&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
===Early twentieth century===
European states were at the fore of plans for an international criminal court under the [[League of Nations]] in the 1930s, working through the Committee for the Repression of Terrorism (CRT). The CRT sought to define terrorism and get nation's domestic policies to support anti-terrorism activities. Opposition by Britain and tensions over fascism in Germany and Italy limited the final proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199660285.001.0001/acprof-9780199660285-chapter-6|title=International Terrorism in the 1920s and '30s: The Response of European States through the League of Nations and the Attempt to Create an International Criminal Court – Oxford Scholarship|publisher=|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199660285.001.0001/acprof-9780199660285-chapter-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europol===
{{Main|Europol|Interpol}}
[[File:Europol Building; The Hague; Eisenhowerlaan; Statenkwartier; 2014; photo nr. 41860.jpg|thumb|The seat of the [[Europol|European Police Office]] (Europol) in [[The Hague]].]]
European cooperation in the field of counter-terrorism include the [[Europol|European Police Office]] (Europol), an EU [[Agency of the European Union|agency]], and [[Interpol]]. [[TREVI]] was an early example of EU cooperation in this field.

The main transnational activity to combat terrorism in recent years has been through Europol. They have categorised acts of terrorism that have either failed, been foiled or been successfully executed within the [[European Union]] (EU) as either pertaining to religious issues, right wing, left wing or separatist movements. The field is subject to considerable cooperation among national authorities.

===Individual countries===
In July 2014 the [[Government of France]] introduced legislation to combat terrorism by toughening surveillance, making it lawful to detain individuals linked to radical "Islamist" groups, and to block Internet sites that incite anti-Semitism, terrorism and hatred. The country's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve revealed 600 French nationals were in Syria at the time or planned to go there. The bill includes a ban on foreign travel for up to six months for those believed to hold terrorist sympathies, provides for the confiscation and invalidation of passports,  and prohibits airlines from allowing such individuals to fly.&lt;ref name="FranceTerrorism"&gt;{{cite news|title=Legislation to crack down on jihadists planned by France|url=http://www.francenews.net/index.php/sid/223650649/scat/e597bd109c960ae3/ht/Legislation-to-crack-down-on-jihadists-planned-by-France|accessdate=10 July 2014|publisher=''France News.Net''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005, the United Kingdom government introduced the CONTEST strategy, which seeks to improve co-operation between security services, and other public and private organisations.&lt;ref name="CONTEST: The United Kingdom's Strategy for Countering Terrorism"&gt;{{cite news|title=The United Kingdom's Strategy for Countering Terrorism: Annual Report 2015|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/539683/55469_Cm_9310_Web_Accessible_v0.11.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2016|publisher=''Her Majesty's Stationery Office''}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes four strands, namely Pursue, (seeking to apprehend potential terrorists), Prevent, (seeking to reduce risks of 'radicalisation', deter potential terrorists and share information), Protect, (seeking to ensure the security of potential targets and organisations is optimised), and Prepare, (seeking to ensure an effective response in the immediate aftermath of any attack).  Similar strategies have been adopted by other countries across the European Union, and there have been increases in co-operation between nations and security forces.

'''Victoria Battery''' (one of two identically-named batteries named after [[Queen Victoria]]) was an [[artillery battery]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It was built in the 1840s on top of the earlier Princess of Wales Batteries following a report by Major-General Sir [[John Thomas Jones]] on Gibraltar's defences. The battery was located on the west side of Gibraltar and was one of a number of "retired" batteries in the territory, constructed to improve the coastal defences between [[Europa Point]] and the town.&lt;ref name="Hughes369"&gt;{{cite book|title=Strong as the Rock of Gibraltar|last1=Hughes|first1=Quentin|last2=Migos|first2=Athanassios|publisher=Exchange Publications|year=1995|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The battery was completed by 1843 and was nicknamed "Snake in the Grass Battery" due to its irregular undulating shape, measuring about {{convert|200|yd}} long. It mounted fifteen 32-pdr. guns in 1850, seven of which were replaced in 1863 by 68-pdrs. In 1868 Colonel W.F.D. Jervois wrote a report into the defences of Gibraltar which recommended installing larger [[rifled muzzle loader]] (RML) guns. Two 9-inch RMLs were installed in the south flank with iron casemates providing protection. This reduced the space available for the other guns to seven emplacements, of which three were occupied by 80-pdr. RMLs by 1888. The 9-inch RMLs were later replaced by 10-inch RMLs but all of the 80-pdrs. were removed in 1892, followed by the 10-inch guns in 1900.&lt;ref name="Hughes369" /&gt;

In 1878 a new battery, also called [[Victoria Battery (100 ton gun)|Victoria Battery]], was constructed on the right flank of the earlier battery to house a [[100 ton gun]]. It was completed in 1883 but fell into disuse within only five years, by which time the gun was already obsolete.&lt;ref name="Hughes370"&gt;{{cite book|title=Strong as the Rock of Gibraltar|last1=Hughes|first1=Quentin|last2=Migos|first2=Athanassios|publisher=Exchange Publications|year=1995|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;
