[[File:Adriano Olivetti 1957.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Adriano Olivetti in Venice, 1957.]]
'''Adriano Olivetti''' (born on 11 April 1901 in  [[Ivrea]], Piedmont, died 27 February 1960 on a train from [[Milan]] to [[Lausanne]]) was an Italian engineer, politician and [[industrialist]] whose entrepreneurial activity thrived on the idea that profit should be reinvested for the benefits of the whole society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lastoriasiamonoi.rai.it/puntate/adriano-olivetti/599/default.aspx|title=Limprenditore rosso|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was son of the founder of [[Olivetti]], [[Camillo Olivetti]], and Luisa Revel, the daughter of a prominent [[Waldensian]] pastor and scholar. Adriano Olivetti was known worldwide during his lifetime as the Italian manufacturer of Olivetti [[typewriter]]s, [[calculator]]s, and computers.

Olivetti was an entrepreneur and innovator who transformed shop-like operations into a modern factory. In and out of the factory, he both practiced and preached the [[utopian]] system of "the community movement," but he never managed to build a mass following.

The Olivetti empire had been begun by his father Camillo. Initially, the "factory" (consisting of 30 workers) concentrated on electric measurement devices. By 1908, 25 years after [[Remington Rand|Remington]] in the United States, Olivetti started to produce typewriters.

==Biography==
[[File:Olivetti Adriano 1925.jpg|thumb|Adriano Olivetti in 1925, with his signature]]

Adriano's father Camillo, who was Jewish, believed that his children could get a better education at home. Adriano's formative years were spent under the tutelage of his mother, daughter of the local Waldensian pastor, an educated and sober woman. Also, as a socialist, Camillo emphasized the non-differentiation between manual and intellectual work. His children, during their time away from study, worked with and under the same conditions as his workers. The discipline and sobriety Camillo imposed on his family induced rebellion in Adriano's adolescence manifested by a dislike of "his father's" workplace and by his studying at a [[institute of technology#Italian language areas|polytechnic]] school of subjects other than the [[mechanical engineering]] his father wanted.

Nevertheless, after graduation in chemical engineering at the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]] in 1924 he joined the company for a short while. When he became undesirable to Mussolini's Fascist regime, his father sent him to the United States to learn the roots of American industrial power. For the same reasons he later went to England. Upon his return he married [[Paola Levi]], a daughter of [[Giuseppe Levi]] and a sister of his good friend [[Natalia Ginzburg]]; a marriage that produced three children but did not last long.

His visit to various plants in the United States, and especially Remington, convinced Adriano that productivity is a function of the organizational system. With the approval of father Camillo, he organized the production system at Olivetti on a quasi-[[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Taylorian]] model and transformed the shop into a factory with departments and divisions. Possibly as a result of this reorganization, output per man-hour doubled within five years. Olivetti for the first time sold half of the typewriters used in Italy in 1933. Adriano Olivetti shared with his workers the productivity gains by increasing salaries, fringe benefits, and services.

In 1931 he visited the [[USSR]] and created an Advertising Department at Olivetti which worked with artists and designers. The creation of an Organization Office followed one year later, when he became general manager, and the project for the first portable typewriter started.&lt;ref name="Adriano Olivetti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazioneadrianolivetti.it/lafondazione.php?id_lafondazione=1|title=Adriano Olivetti|work=Fondazione Adriano Olivetti|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His success in business did not diminish his idealism. In the 1930s he developed an interest in architecture, as well as urban and community planning. He supervised a housing plan for the workers at Ivrea (a small city near [[Turin]], where the Olivetti plant is still located) and a zoning proposal for the adjacent [[Aosta Valley]]. Under Fascism, patronizing workers at work and at home was in line with the corporative design of the regime. While Adriano showed distaste for the regime, he joined the Fascist Party and became a [[Catholic]]. Yet during [[World War II]] he participated in the underground [[antifascist]] movement, was jailed, and at the end sought refuge in [[Switzerland]]. There he was in close contact with the intellectual emigrees and he was able to develop further his [[socio-philosophy]] of the [[Community Movement]]. He also had contacts with representatives of the British [[Special Operations Executive]]. With these he tried to avoid Allied invasion of Italy and to obtain a negotiated Italian retreat from the war assuming a mediation of the Holy See and making strong the support that he enjoyed with influential Italian political circles.&lt;ref&gt;Mireno Berrettini, La Gran Bretagna e l'Antifascismo italiano. Diplomazia clandestina, Intelligence, Operazioni Speciali (1940–1943), Firenze, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During the immediate post-war years the Olivetti empire expanded rapidly, only to be briefly on the verge of bankruptcy after the acquisition of Underwood in the late 1950s. During this period, first calculators and then computers replaced the typewriter as a prime production focus. Adriano shared his time between business pursuits and attempts to practice and spread the utopian ideal of community life. His belief was that people who respect each other and their environment can avoid war and poverty. His utopian idea was similar to that preached by [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]] during the previous century.

In his enterprises, Adriano Olivetti's attempts at utopia may be translated in practice as actions of an enlightened boss or a form of [[corporatism]]. He decreased the hours of work and increased salaries and fringe benefits. By 1957 Olivetti workers were the best paid of all in the metallurgical industry and Olivetti workers showed the highest productivity. His corporatism also succeeded in having his workers accept a company union not tied to the powerful national metallurgical trade unions.

During the 1950s, in a limited way, the community movement succeeded politically in Ivrea. (Adriano was even elected mayor of Ivrea in 1956.) But the utopia at the factory and in Italy at large began withering away even before Adriano's death in 1960.

Adriano Olivetti's era saw great changes in Italian business and in industrial relations. New organizational methods were sought and humanistic idealism spread during the cruel time of World War II as well as during the difficult post-war years. The utopia of Olivetti could not have easily survived, but it helped induce the rapid reconversion of Italy's industry from war to peace-time production.

In 2014, he was replaced as FEU Law dean by Atty. [[Mel Sta. Maria]].

==Commission on Elections==

In August 2010, Bautista was appointed by President [[Benigno Aquino III]] as chairman of the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/605305/andy-bautista-head-pcgg|title=Andy Bautista to head PCGG|accessdate= 2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2015, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] signed Bautista's appointment as the new COMELEC chairman. This appointment played an important role in the 2016 [[General Elections]] in the Philippines, where many issues and accusations circulated in the media and online social networks about the alleged manipulation of the election results by the dominant political party at the time, [[Liberal Party (Philippines)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.ph/news/headlines/205403/comelec-server-rigged-for-leni-.html|title= Comelec server ‘rigged for Leni’|accessdate= 2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/785052/miriam-defends-bongbong-accuses-govt-of-manufacturing-numbers|title= Miriam defends Bongbong, accuses gov’t of ‘manufacturing’ numbers|accessdate= 2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://interaksyon.com/article/127487/when-vcms-malfunction-heat-trumps-suffrage-as-sweating-voters-just-leave|title= Malfunctioning vote machines, hot polling precincts, congestion mar elections|accessdate= 2016-05-14|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160510130115/http://interaksyon.com/article/127487/when-vcms-malfunction-heat-trumps-suffrage-as-sweating-voters-just-leave|archive-date= 2016-05-10|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The camp of losing vice-presidential candidate [[Bongbong Marcos|Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.]] claimed that reports of irregularities in the hash code of the data provided by the COMELEC's transparency server. To rebuff these claims, COMELEC explains that this happened as the result of the correction of the character 'Ñ' which did not render properly in the output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/05/bbm-marcos-leni-robredo-comelec-smartmatic-abaya.html|title= BBM vs Leni: Comelec-Smartmatic gives Sec.

Another accusation claimed by the Marcos camp was the reports of another discrepancy in the data provided by the same transparency server, where the number of votes have been slightly decreased further. Bautista himself explained that this occurred as the result of their intentional act of removing the "test votes" which were apparently included in the official vote counts by accident, and reported by the transparency server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/566123/news/nation/decrease-in-numbers-in-transparency-server-seen|title= Decrease in numbers in transparency server seen|accessdate= 2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2017, Bautista announced his intention to resign as chairman of the Commission on Elections by the end of the year following claims by his wife Patricia of unexplained wealth, which he has denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ager|first1=Malia|last2=Santos|first2=Tina|title=Comelec chair Andres Bautista resigns|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/937101/breaking-comelec-chair-andres-bautista-resigns|accessdate=October 11, 2017|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hours after announcing his intent to resign, the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] voted 137–75–2 to [[Impeachment in the Philippines|impeach]] Bautista from the post, overturning the House Committee on Justice's earlier decision to discard the impeachment case. The articles of impeachment have yet to reach the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]], which will serve as the impeachment court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morallo|first1=Audrey|title=House votes to impeach Comelec Chairman Bautista|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/10/11/1747759/house-votes-impeach-comelec-chairman-bautista|accessdate=October 11, 2017|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] formally accepted the resignation letter of Bautista effective immediately, instead of the initial date of December 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/186159-comelec-chair-andres-bautista-resignation-effective-immediately|title=BREAKING: Comelec Chair Bautista's resignation effective immediately – Malacañang|last=Ranada|first=Pia|date=October 23, 2017|work=|accessdate=October 23, 2017|publisher=[[Rappler]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conferences==
Bautista has been a reactor in the ''18th IDP International Education Conference'' in [[Sydney]] in 2004, a participant in the bilateral discussions with the University of Nepal Faculty of Law in [[Kathmandu]] in 2002 (no such university name in Nepal), a reactor in the ''21st Century Form of Legal Education'' in Beijing in 2001, a delegate in the ''Conference on Obstacles to Third World Development'' in 1988, and Captain of the Philippine Team in the ''World University Debating Championships'' also in 1986.

'''''BizWest''''' is a [[print media|print]] and [[Digital media|electronic]] [[List of business newspapers|business paper]] in [[Northern Colorado]].

== History ==
In 2010, [[Brown Publishing Company]], the owner of the newspapers ''Boulder County Business Report'' and ''Northern Colorado Business Report'' declared bankruptcy and, in September, sold them to [[Ohio Community Media]]. In February 2011, the publishers of the two papers formed BizWest Media to acquire their publications, the ''Wyoming Business Report'', and ancillary other assets from Ohio Community Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Publisher-led group buys Colorado business newspapers |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2011/02/13/bcbr.html |newspaper=[[Denver Business Journal]] |date=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallace |first=Alicia |date=February 14, 2011 |title=Boulder publishing company acquires Boulder County Business Report |newspaper=[[The Daily Camera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, the ''Boulder County Business Report'' and ''Northern Colorado Business Report'' were merged into a biweekly printed paper called ''BizWest'', with initial circulation of 9,000 to cover [[Boulder County, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Broomfield County|Broomfield]], [[Larimer County, Colorado|Larimer]] and [[Weld County, Colorado|Weld counties]], as well as the Denver-Boulder corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradoan.com/story/money/2014/02/26/noco-biz-report-to-form-bizwest-with-denver-publication/5848351/|title=Northern Colorado Business Report to form BizWest with Denver publication |newspaper=[[Fort Collins Coloradoan]] |date=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/26/colorado-business-papers-combine-into-biweekly-newspaper-bizwest/ |title=Colorado business papers combine into biweekly newspaper BizWest |last= |first= |date=26 February 2014 |website=[[The Denver Post]] |publisher=Digital First Media |access-date=25 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, ''BizWest'' reduced its print publication frequency to monthly and laid off four of its eighteen staff, including one writer. The company cited subscribers shifting to digital-only subscriptions and management's desire to focus on growth areas of the business as reasons for the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Castle |first=Shay |date=September 14, 2016 |title=BizWest lays off 4, shifts to once-monthly print schedule |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_30361283/bizwest-lays-off-4-shifts-once-monthly-print |newspaper=[[The Daily Camera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canned responses''' are predetermined responses to common questions.

In fields such as [[technical support]], canned responses to [[frequently asked question]]s may be quick and convenient for both the customer and the technical adviser. In text-based technical support systems, the [[operator (profession)|operator]] may insert a canned response triggered by keystrokes or from a drop-down menu, rather than typing the same answer repeatedly or pasting from some other resource. For example, if a support representative at an [[Internet service provider|ISP]]'s technical support team is asked to explain how to add an [[email attachment|attachment to an email]], rather than typing in all the details, the support representative may choose the response from a drop down menu, and it gets inserted into the response. The representative is more productive this way, and the user receives a more carefully crafted answer. Some programs have built-in functions which allow canned responses, and other software is available which can insert canned responses into any other application.

Canned responses, however, can have disadvantages. Sloppy or pressured support people could end up using canned responses as a quick fix when they actually do not really resolve the customer's problem or are only tangentially relevant to the user's problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8118">'''Cathodic arc deposition''' or '''Arc-PVD''' is a [[physical vapor deposition]] technique in which an [[electric arc]] is used to [[vaporize]] material from a [[cathode]] target.  The vaporized material then condenses on a substrate, forming a [[thin film]]. The technique can be used to deposit [[metal]]lic, [[ceramic]], and [[Composite material|composite]] films.

==History==
Industrial use of modern cathodic arc deposition technology originated in [[Soviet Union]] around 1960–1970.
By the late 70's Soviet government released the use of this technology to the West. 
Among many designs in USSR at that time the design by [[L. P. Sablev]], et al., was allowed to be used outside the USSR.

==Process==
The arc evaporation process begins with the striking of a high [[Electric current|current]], low [[voltage]] arc on the surface of a [[cathode]] (known as the target) that gives rise to a small (usually a few [[micrometre]]s wide), highly energetic emitting area known as a cathode spot. The localised temperature at the cathode spot is extremely high (around 15000&amp;nbsp;°C), which results in a high [[velocity]] (10&amp;nbsp;km/s) jet of vapourised cathode material, leaving a crater behind on the cathode surface. The cathode spot is only active for a short period of time, then it self-extinguishes and re-ignites in a new area close to the previous crater. This behaviour causes the apparent motion of the arc.

As the arc is basically a current carrying conductor it can be influenced by the application of an [[electromagnetic field]], which in practice is used to rapidly move the arc over the entire surface of the target, so that the total surface is eroded over time.

The arc has an extremely high [[power density]] resulting in a high level of [[ionization]] (30-100%), multiple charged [[ions]], neutral particles, clusters and macro-particles (droplets). If a reactive gas is introduced during the evaporation process, [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]], ionization and [[Excited state|excitation]] can occur during interaction with the [[ion flux]] and a compound film will be deposited.

One downside of the arc evaporation process is that if the cathode spot stays at an evaporative point for too long it can eject a large amount of macro-particles or droplets. These droplets are detrimental to the performance of the coating as they are poorly adhered and can extend through the coating. Worse still if the cathode target material has a low melting point such as [[aluminium]] the cathode spot can evaporate through the target resulting in either the target backing plate material being evaporated or cooling water entering the chamber. Therefore, magnetic fields as mentioned previously are used to control the motion of the arc. If cylindrical cathodes are used the cathodes can also be rotated during deposition. By not allowing the cathode spot to remain in one position too long aluminium targets can be used and the number of droplets is reduced. Some companies also use filtered arcs that use magnetic fields to separate the droplets from the coating flux.

==Equipment design==

[[File:ArcSource SablevType.jpg|thumb|right|Sablev type Cathodic arc source with magnet to steer the movement of arc spot]]

Sablev type Cathodic arc source, which is the most widely used in the West, consists of a short cylindrical shape electrical conductive target at cathode with one open end. This target has an electrically-floating metal ring surrounded working as an arc confinement ring (Strel'nitskij shield). The anode for the system can be either the vacuum chamber wall or a discrete anode. Arc spots are generated by mechanical trigger (or igniter) striking on open end of the target making a temporarily short circuit between the cathode and anode. After the arc spots being generated they can be steered by magnetic field or move randomly in absence of magnetic field.

[[File:AksenovQuaterTorusFilter.jpg|thumb|right|Aksenov Quarter-torus duct macroparticle filter using plasma optical principles which was developed by [[A. I. Morozov]]]]

The [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] beam from Cathodic Arc source contains some larger clusters of atoms or molecules (so called macro-particles), which prevent it from being useful for some applications without some kind of filtering.
There are many designs for macro-particle filters and the most studied design is based on the work by I. I. Aksenov et al. in 70's. It consists of a quarter-torus duct bent at 90 degrees from the arc source and the plasma is guided out of the duct by principle of plasma optics.

There are also other interesting designs such as a design which incorporates a straight duct filter built-in with truncated cone shape cathode as reported by D. A. Karpov in the 90's. This design became quite popular among both the thin hard-film coaters and researchers in Russia and former USSR countries until now.
Cathodic arc source can be made into the long tubular shape (extended-arc) or long rectangular shape but both designs are less popular.

==Applications==

[[File:TiNCoatedPunches NanoShieldPVD Thailand.JPG|thumb|right|Titanium Nitride (TiN) coated punches using Cathodic arc deposition technique]]
[[File:AlTiNCoatedEndmill NanoShieldPVD Thailand.JPG|thumb|right|Aluminium Titanium Nitride (AlTiN) coated [[endmill]]s using Cathodic arc deposition technique]] 
[[File:AlCrTiN-CoatedHob NanoShieldPVD Thailand.jpg|thumb|right|Aluminium Chromium Titanium Nitride (AlCrTiN) coated [[Hobbing|Hob]] using Cathodic arc deposition technique]]

Cathodic arc deposition is actively used to synthesize extremely hard film to protect the surface of cutting tools and extend their life significantly.  A wide variety of thin hard-film, [[Superhard coatings]] and [[nanocomposite]] coatings can be synthesized by this technology including [[TiN]], [[TiAlN]], [[CrN]], [[ZrN]], [[AlCrTiN]] and [[TiAlSiN]].

This is also used quite extensively particularly for carbon ion deposition to create [[diamond-like carbon]] films. Because the ions are blasted from the surface [[Ballistics|ballistic]]ally, it is common for not only single atoms, but larger clusters of atoms to be ejected. Thus, this kind of system requires a filter to remove atom clusters  from the beam before deposition.
The DLC film from filtered-arc contains extremely high percentage of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; diamond which is known as [[tetrahedral amorphous carbon]], or [[ta-C]].

Filtered Cathodic arc can be used as metal ion/plasma source for ''[[Ion implantation]]'' and ''[[Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation and Deposition]]'' (PIII&amp;D).

'''Creative destruction''' (German: ''schöpferische Zerstörung''), sometimes known as '''Schumpeter's gale''', is a concept in [[economics]] which since the 1950s has become most readily identified with the [[Austrians|Austrian]] economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]]&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt; who derived it from the work of [[Karl Marx]] and popularized it as a theory of [[Innovation economics|economic innovation]] and the [[business cycle]].

According to Schumpeter, the "gale of creative destruction" describes the "process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one".&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942_2"/&gt; In [[Marxian economic theory]] the concept refers more broadly to the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of [[wealth]] under capitalism.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044757-1"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier work of Marx, however, the idea of creative destruction or annihilation (German: ''Vernichtung'') implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders, but also that it must ceaselessly devalue existing wealth (whether through war, dereliction, or regular and periodic economic crises) in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044757-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044575-7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx1863"/&gt;

In ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942), Joseph Schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of Marx’s thought (to which the whole of Part I of the book is devoted), arguing (in Part II) that the creative-destructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system (see below).&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942"&gt;{{cite book

==History==

=== In Marx's thought ===
Although the modern term "creative destruction" is not used explicitly by Marx, it is largely derived from his analyses, particularly in the work of Werner Sombart (whom Engels described as the only German professor who understood Marx's ''Capital''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Abram L. |last=Harris |title=Sombart and German (National) Socialism |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=50 |issue=6 |year=1942 |pages=805–35 [p. 807] |doi=10.1086/255964 |jstor=1826617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of Joseph Schumpeter, who discussed at length the origin of the idea in Marx's work (see below).

In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' of 1848, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] described the crisis tendencies of capitalism in terms of "the enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. [...] It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the whole of bourgeois society on trial, each time more threateningly. In these crises, ''a great part not only of existing production, but also of previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed''. In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity – the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions. […] And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by ''enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces''; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044757-1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A few years later, in the ''Grundrisse'', Marx was writing of "the violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it, but rather as a condition of its self-preservation".&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044575-7" /&gt; In other words, he establishes a necessary link between the generative or creative forces of production in capitalism and the destruction of capital value as one of the key ways in which capitalism attempts to overcome its internal contradictions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These contradictions lead to explosions, cataclysms, crises, in which [...] momentaneous suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital [...] violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled [to go on] fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044575-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott1978-79"&gt;For further discussion of the concept of creative discussion in the Grundrisse, see {{Cite journal | last1 = Elliott | first1 = J. E. | title = Marx's "Grundrisse": Vision of Capitalism's Creative Destruction | jstor = 4537475 | journal = Journal of Post Keynesian Economics | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 148–69 | year = 1978 | doi = 10.2307/4537475| doi-broken-date = 2018-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the ''Theories of Surplus Value'' ("Volume IV" of ''[[Das Kapital]]'', 1863), Marx refines this theory to distinguish between scenarios where the destruction of (commodity) values affects either use values or exchange values or both together.&lt;ref name="isbn1-84467-095-3"/&gt; The destruction of exchange value combined with the preservation of use value presents clear opportunities for new capital investment and hence for the repetition of the production-devaluation cycle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the destruction of capital through crises means the depreciation of values which prevents them from later renewing their reproduction process as capital on the same scale. This is the ruinous effect of the fall in the prices of commodities. It does not cause the destruction of any use-values. What one loses, the other gains. Values used as capital are prevented from acting again as capital in the hands of the same person. The old capitalists go bankrupt. [...] A large part of the nominal capital of the society, i.e., of the exchange-value of the existing capital, is once for all destroyed, although this very destruction, since it does not affect the use-value, may very much expedite the new reproduction. This is also the period during which moneyed interest enriches itself at the cost of industrial interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Social geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] sums up the differences between Marx's usage of these concepts and Schumpeter's: "Both Karl Marx and Joseph Schumpeter wrote at length on the 'creative-destructive' tendencies inherent in capitalism. While Marx clearly admired capitalism's creativity he [...] strongly emphasised its self-destructiveness. The Schumpeterians have all along gloried in capitalism's endless creativity while treating the destructiveness as mostly a matter of the normal costs of doing business".&lt;ref name="isbn1-84668-308-4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey, David|authorlink=David Harvey (geographer)|title=The Enigma of Capital and the Crises of Capitalism|publisher=Profile Books|location=London|year=2010|page=46|isbn=978-1-84668-308-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ww1dPgAACAAJ|accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other early usage ===
[[File:WLANL - MicheleLovesArt - Tropenmuseum - Shiva Nataraja (6274-1).jpg|thumb|In [[Hinduism]], the god [[Shiva]] is simultaneously destroyer and creator, portrayed as ''[[Shiva Nataraja]]'' (Lord of the Dance), which is proposed as the source of the Western notion of "creative destruction".&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt;]]
In the [[Origin of Species]], which was published in 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] wrote that the "extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms."  One notable exception to this rule is how the extinction of the dinosaurs facilitated the [[adaptive radiation]] of mammals.  In this case creation was the consequence, rather than the cause, of destruction.    

In philosophical terms, the concept of "creative destruction" is close to [[Hegel]]´s concept of [[Aufheben|sublation]]. In German economic discourse it was taken up from Marx's writings by [[Werner Sombart]], particularly in his 1913 text ''Krieg und Kapitalismus'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sombart |first=W. |authorlink=Werner Sombart |year=1913 |title=Krieg und Kapitalismus |trans-title=War and Capitalism |location=Leipzig |publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot |page=207 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeLrAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, however, ''from destruction a new spirit of creation arises;'' the scarcity of wood and the needs of everyday life... forced the discovery or invention of substitutes for wood, forced the use of coal for heating, forced the invention of coke for the production of iron.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hugo Reinert has argued that Sombart's formulation of the concept was influenced by [[Eastern mysticism]], specifically the image of the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]], who is presented in the paradoxical aspect of simultaneous destroyer and creator.&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt; Conceivably this influence passed from [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who brought Hindu thought to German philosophy in his ''Philosophy of Human History'' (Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit) (Herder 1790–92), specifically volume III, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–64.&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt; via [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and the [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Friedrich Maier]] through [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]´s writings. Nietzsche represented the creative destruction of modernity through the mythical figure of [[Dionysus]], a figure whom he saw as at one and the same time "destructively creative" and "creatively destructive".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following passage from ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' (1887), Nietzsche argues for a universal principle of a cycle of creation and destruction, such that every creative act has its destructive consequence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost? How much reality has had to be misunderstood and slandered, how many lies have had to be sanctified, how many consciences disturbed, how much "God" sacrificed every time? If a temple is to be erected a temple must be destroyed: that is the law – let anyone who can show me a case in which it is not fulfilled! – [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other nineteenth-century formulations of this idea include Russian [[anarchist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]], who wrote in 1842, "The passion for destruction is a creative passion, too!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1842/reaction-germany.htm The Reaction in Germany, From the Notebooks of a Frenchman], October 1842&lt;/ref&gt; Note, however, that this earlier formulation might more accurately be termed "destructive creation",{{Original research inline|date=July 2014}} and differs sharply from Marx's and Schumpeter's formulations in its focus on the active destruction of the existing social and political order by human agents (as opposed to systemic forces or contradictions in the case of both Marx and Schumpeter).

=={{Anchor|Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter}}Association with Joseph Schumpeter==
The expression "creative destruction" was popularized by and is most associated with Joseph Schumpeter, particularly in his book ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'', first published in 1942. Already in his 1939 book ''Business Cycles'', he attempted to refine the innovative ideas of [[Nikolai Kondratieff]] and his [[Kondratiev wave|long-wave]] cycle which Schumpeter believed was driven by technological innovation.&lt;ref name="Crumbling Walls"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in ''Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'', Schumpeter introduced the term "creative destruction", which he explicitly derived from Marxist thought (analysed extensively in Part I of the book) and used it to describe the disruptive process of transformation that accompanies such innovation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Capitalism [...] is by nature a form or method of economic change and not only never is but never can be stationary. [...] The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.&lt;p&gt;[...] The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as U.S. Steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure ''from within'', incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in.&lt;p&gt;[... Capitalism requires] the perennial gale of Creative Destruction.&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942_2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Schumpeter's vision of capitalism, innovative entry by [[entrepreneurs]] was the disruptive force that sustained [[economic growth]], even as it destroyed the value of established companies and laborers that enjoyed some degree of [[monopoly]] power derived from previous technological, organizational, regulatory, and economic paradigms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. Gregory |last=Sidak |first2=David J. |last2=Teece |title=Dynamic Competition in Antitrust Law |journal=[[Journal of Competition Law &amp; Economics]] |year=2009 |volume=5  |issue=4 |pages=581–631 [p. 604] |doi=10.1093/joclec/nhp024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Schumpeter was pessimistic about the sustainability of this process, seeing it as leading eventually to the undermining of capitalism's own institutional frameworks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In breaking down the pre-capitalist framework of society, capitalism thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying buttresses that prevented its collapse. That process, impressive in its relentless necessity, was not merely a matter of removing institutional deadwood, but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum, symbiosis with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema. [... T]he capitalist process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional framework of feudal society also undermines its own.&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Schumpeter nevertheless elaborated the concept, making it central to his economic theory, and it was later taken up as a major doctrine of the so-called Austrian School of free-market economic thought.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In fact, successful [[innovation]] is normally a source of temporary [[market power]], eroding the profits and position of old firms, yet ultimately succumbing to the pressure of new inventions commercialised by competing entrants.

{{Quote|These economic facts have certain social consequences. As the critics of the market economy nowadays prefer to take their stand on "social" grounds, it may be not inappropriate here to elucidate the true social results of the market process. We have already spoken of it as a leveling process. More aptly, we may now describe these results as an instance of what [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] called "[[circulation of elite|the circulation of elites]]." Wealth is unlikely to stay for long in the same hands. It passes from hand to hand as unforeseen change confers value, now on this, now on that specific resource, engendering capital gains and losses.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the creation of the built environment can act as a form of crisis displacement, it can also constitute a limit in its own right, as it tends to freeze productive forces into a fixed spatial form. As capital cannot abide a limit to profitability, ever more frantic forms of "[[time-space compression]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAGeva8_ElMC |isbn=978-0-631-16294-0 |pages=240–323 |title=The Condition of Postmodernity: an Enquiry into the Origins of Cultural Change |last=Harvey |first=David |authorlink=David Harvey (geographer) |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; (increased speed of turnover, innovation of ever faster transport and communications' infrastructure, "flexible accumulation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-631-16294-0 |page=147 |title=The Condition of Postmodernity |last=Harvey |first=David |authorlink=David Harvey (geographer) |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;) ensue, often impelling technological innovation. Such innovation, however, is a double-edged sword:

{{Quote|The effect of continuous innovation [...] is to devalue, if not destroy, past investments and labour skills. ''Creative destruction'' is embedded within the circulation of capital itself. Innovation exacerbates instability, insecurity, and in the end, becomes the prime force pushing capitalism into periodic paroxysms of crisis. [...] The struggle to maintain profitability sends capitalists racing off to explore all kinds of other possibilities. New product lines are opened up, and that means the creation of new wants and needs. Capitalists are forced to redouble their efforts to create new needs in others [...]. The result is to exacerbate insecurity and instability, as masses of capital and workers shift from one line of production to another, leaving whole sectors devastated [...]. The drive to relocate to more advantageous places (the geographical movement of both capital and labour) periodically revolutionizes the international and territorial division of labour, adding a vital geographical dimension to the insecurity. The resultant transformation in the experience of space and place is matched by revolutions in the time dimension, as capitalists strive to reduce the turnover time of their capital to "the twinkling of an eye".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-631-16294-0 |pages=105–06 |title=The Condition of Postmodernity |last=Harvey |first=David |authorlink=David Harvey (geographer) |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Globalization can be viewed as some ultimate form of time-space compression, allowing capital investment to move almost instantaneously from one corner of the globe to another, devaluing fixed assets and laying off labour in one urban conglommeration while opening up new centres of manufacture in more profitable sites for production operations. Hence, in this continual process of creative destruction, capitalism does not resolve its contradictions and crises, but merely "moves them around geographically".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

=== Marshall Berman ===
In his 1987 book ''All That is Solid Melts into Air: The Experience of Modernity'',&lt;ref name="isbn0-86091-785-1" /&gt; particularly in the chapter entitled "Innovative Self-Destruction" (pp.&amp;nbsp;98–104), [[Marshall Berman]] provides a reading of Marxist "creative destruction" to explain key processes at work within modernity. The title of the book is taken from a well-known passage from ''The Communist Manifesto''. Berman elaborates this into something of a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' which has profound social and cultural consequences:

{{Quote|The truth of the matter, as Marx sees, is that everything that bourgeois society builds is built to be torn down. "All that is solid"—from the clothes on our backs to the looms and mills that weave them, to the men and women who work the machines, to the houses and neighborhoods the workers live in, to the firms and corporations that exploit the workers, to the towns and cities and whole regions and even nations that embrace them all—all these are made to be broken tomorrow, smashed or shredded or pulverized or dissolved, so they can be recycled or replaced next week, and the whole process can go on again and again, hopefully forever, in ever more profitable forms. The pathos of all bourgeois monuments is that their material strength and solidity actually count for nothing and carry no weight at all, that they are blown away like frail reeds by the very forces of capitalist development that they celebrate. Even the most beautiful and impressive bourgeois buildings and public works are disposable, capitalized for fast depreciation and planned to be obsolete, closer in their social functions to tents and encampments than to "Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, Gothic cathedrals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Berman |first=Marshall |title=All That is Solid Melts into Air |year=1987 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here Berman emphasizes Marx's perception of the fragility and evanescence of capitalism's immense creative forces, and makes this apparent contradiction into one of the key explanatory figures of modernity.

=== Manuel Castells ===
The sociologist [[Manuel Castells]], in his trilogy on ''[[The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture]]'' (the first volume of which, ''[[The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture#The Rise of the Network Society|The Rise of the Network Society]]'', appeared in 1996),&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-22140-9" /&gt; reinterpreted the processes by which capitalism invests in certain regions of the globe, while divesting from others, using the new paradigm of "informational networks". In the era of globalization, capitalism is characterized by near-instantaneous flow, creating a new spatial dimension, "the [[space of flows]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Castells |first=Manuel |title=The Rise of the Network Society |pages=376–428}}&lt;/ref&gt; While technological innovation has enabled this unprecedented fluidity, this very process makes redundant whole areas and populations who are bypassed by informational networks. Indeed, the new spatial form of the [[megacity|mega-city]] or megalopolis, is defined by Castells as having the contradictory quality of being "globally connected and locally disconnected, physically and socially".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Castells |first=Manuel |title=The Rise of the Network Society |page=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castells explicitly links these arguments to the notion of creative destruction:

{{Quote|The "spirit of informationalism" is the culture of "creative destruction" accelerated to the speed of the optoelectronic circuits that process its signals. Schumpeter meets [[Max Weber|Weber]] in the cyberspace of the network enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Castells |first=Manuel |title=The Rise of the Network Society |page=199}} For further discussion, see also {{Cite journal

===Daniele Archibugi===
Developing the Schumpeterian legacy, the school of the [[Science Policy Research Unit]] of the [[University of Sussex]] has further detailed the importance of creative destruction exploring, in particular, how new technologies are often idiosyncratic with the existing productive regimes and will lead to bankruptcy companies and even industries that do not manage to sustain the rate of change. [[Christopher Freeman|Chris Freeman]] and [[Carlota Perez]] have developed these insights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Freeman|Chris Freeman]] and Francisco Louça, ''As Time Goes By: From the Industrial Revolutions to the Information Revolution'' (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2001). [[Carlota Perez]], ''Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages'', (Cheltenham  Glos, Edward Elgar, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Daniele Archibugi]] and Andrea Filippetti have associated the 2008 economic crisis to the slow-down of opportunities offered by information and communication technologies (ICTs).&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi and Andrea Filippetti, [https://www.routledge.com/Innovation-and-Economic-Crisis-Lessons-and-Prospects-from-the-Economic/Archibugi-Filippetti/p/book/9780415602280 ''Innovation and Economic Crisis Lessons and Prospects from the Economic Downturn''], (London, Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Using as a metaphor the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', Archibugi has argued that of the innovations described in the film in 1982, all those associated to ICTs have become part of our everyday life. But, on the contrary, none of those in the field of Biotech have been fully commercialized. A new economic recovery will occur when some key technological opportunities will be identified and sustained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2557335 Blade Runner Economics: Will Innovation Lead the Economic Recovery?], SSRN Papers 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Technological opportunities do not enter into economic and social life without deliberate efforts and choices. We should be able to envisage new forms of organization associated with emerging technology. ICTs have already changed our lifestyle even more than our economic life: they have generated jobs and profits, but above all they have transformed the way we use our time and interact with the world. Biotech could bring about even more radical social transformations at the core of our life. Why have these not yet been delivered? What can be done to unleash their potential? There are a few basic questions that need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2557335 Blade Runner Economics.

=== Others ===
In 1992, the idea of creative destruction was put into formal mathematical terms by [[Philippe Aghion]] and [[Peter Howitt (economist)|Peter Howitt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aghion |first=Philippe |last2=Howitt |first2= Peter |title=A Model of Growth Through Creative Destruction |journal=Econometrica |year=1992 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=323–51 |jstor=2951599 |doi=10.2307/2951599 |hdl=1721.1/63839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving an alternative model of [[Endogenous growth theory|endogenous growth]] compared to [[Paul Romer]]'s expanding varieties model.

In 1995, [[Harvard Business School]] authors [[Richard L. Nolan]] and David C. Croson released ''Creative Destruction:  A Six-Stage Process for Transforming the Organization.''  The book advocated downsizing to free up slack resources, which could then be reinvested to create [[competitive advantage]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

More recently, the idea of "creative destruction" was utilized by Max Page in his 1999 book, ''The Creative Destruction of Manhattan, 1900–1940.''  The book traces [[Manhattan]]'s constant reinvention, often at the expense of preserving a concrete past. Describing this process as "creative destruction," Page describes the complex historical circumstances, economics, social conditions and personalities that have produced crucial changes in Manhattan's cityscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Page|first=Max|title=The Creative Destruction of Manhattan, 1900–1940|year=1999|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-64468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Max Page, others have used the term “creative destruction” to describe the process of urban renewal and modernization. T.C. Chang and Shirlena Huang referenced “creative destruction” in their paper ''Recreating place, replacing memory: Creative Destruction at the [[Singapore River]].'' The authors explored the efforts to redevelop a waterfront area that reflected a vibrant new culture while paying sufficient homage to the history of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=T.C.|author2=Shirlena Huang|title=Recreating place, replacing memory: Creative destruction at the Singapore River|journal=Asia Pacific Viewpoint|date=December 2005|volume=46|issue=3|pages=267–80|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8373.2005.00285.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosemary Wakeman chronicled the evolution of an area in central Paris, France known as [[Les Halles]]. Les Halles housed a vibrant marketplace starting in the twelfth century. Ultimately, in 1971, the markets were relocated and the pavilions torn down. In their place, now stand a hub for trains, subways and buses. Les Halles is also the site of the largest shopping mall in France and the controversial Centre Georges Pompidou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wakeman|first=Rosemary|title=Fascinating Les Halles|journal=French Politics, Culture &amp; Society|date=Summer 2007|volume=25|issue=2|pages=46–72|doi=10.3167/fpcs.2007.250205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “creative destruction” has been applied to the arts. Alan Ackerman and Martin Puncher (2006) edited a collection of essays under the title ''Against Theater: Creative destruction on the modernist stage.'' They detail the changes and the causal motivations experienced in [[theater]] as a result of the modernization of both the production of performances and the underlying economics. They speak of how theater has reinvented itself in the face of [[anti-theatricality]], straining the boundaries of the traditional to include more physical productions, which might be considered avant-garde staging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ackerman|first=Alan|title=Against Theater|year=2006|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4039-4491-7|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1999 book, ''Still the New World, American Literature in a Culture of Creative Destruction'', [[Philip Fisher (author)|Philip Fisher]] analyzes the themes of creative destruction at play in literary works of the twentieth century, including the works of such authors as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Mark Twain]], and [[Henry James]], among others. Fisher argues that creative destruction exists within literary forms just as it does within the changing of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Still the New World: American Literature in a Culture of Creative Destruction|last=Fisher|first=Philip|publisher=Harvard University Press, Second Edition|year=1999|isbn=978-0674004092|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoconservative]] author [[Michael Ledeen]] argued in his 2002 book ''The War Against the Terror Masters'' that America is a revolutionary nation, undoing traditional societies: "Creative destruction is our middle name, both within our own society and abroad. We tear down the old order every day, from business to science, literature, art, architecture, and cinema to politics and the law." His characterization of creative destruction as a model for social development has met with fierce opposition from [[paleoconservative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=John Laughland |first=John |last=Laughland |url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2003/jun/30/00013/ |title=Flirting with Fascism. Neocon theorist Michael Ledeen draws more from Italian fascism than from the American Right |journal=American Conservative |date=June 30, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative destruction has also been linked to sustainable development. The connection was explicitly mentioned for the first time by Stuart L. Hart and Mark B. Milstein in their 1999 article ''Global Sustainability and the Creative Destruction of Industries'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stuart |last=Hart |first2=Mark |last2=Milstein |title=Global Sustainability and the Creative Destruction of Industries |journal=Sloan Management Review |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=23–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he argues new profit opportunities lie in a round of creative destruction driven by global sustainability. (An argument which they would later on strengthen in their 2003 article ''Creating Sustainable Value''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stuart L. |last=Hart |first2=Mark B. |last2=Milstein |title=Creating Sustainable Value |journal=Academy of Management Executive |volume=17 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=56–67 |doi=10.5465/AME.2003.10025194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2005, with ''Innovation, Creative Destruction and Sustainability''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stuart L. |last=Hart |title=Innovation, Creative Destruction and Sustainability |journal=Research Technology Management |volume=48 |issue=5 |year=2005 |pages=21–27 |doi=10.1080/08956308.2005.11657334}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Andrea L. Larson agreed with this vision a year later in ''Sustainable Innovation Through an Entrepreneurship Lens'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrea L. |last=Larson |title=Sustainable Innovation Through an Entrepreneurship Lens |journal=Business Strategy and the Environment |volume=9 |year=2000 |pages=304–17 |doi=10.1002/1099-0836(200009/10)9:5&lt;304::AID-BSE255&gt;3.0.CO;2-O |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating entrepreneurs should be open to the opportunities for disruptive improvement based on sustainability. In 2005, James Hartshorn (et al.) emphasized the opportunities for sustainable, disruptive improvement in the construction industry in his article ''Creative Destruction: Building Toward Sustainability''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=James |last=Hartshorn |first2=Michael |last2=Maher |first3=Jack |last3=Crooks |first4=Richard |last4=Stahl |first5=Zoë |last5=Bond |title=Creative Destruction: Building Toward Sustainability |journal=Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=170–80 |doi=10.1139/l04-119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative name==
The following text appears to be the source of the phrase "Schumpeter's Gale" to refer to creative destruction:

{{quote|The opening up of new markets and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as US Steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one ... [The process] must be seen in its role in the perennial gale of creative destruction; it cannot be understood on the hypothesis that there is a perennial lull.|Joseph Schumpeter|''Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'', 1942}}

==In popular culture==
The film ''[[Other People's Money]]'' (1991) provides contrasting views of creative destruction, presented in two speeches regarding the takeover of a publicly traded wire and cable company in a small New England town. One speech is by a [[corporate raider]], and the other is given by the company CEO, who is principally interested in protecting his employees and the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth M.

'''Cyrus Stephen Eaton, Sr.''' (December 27, 1883 &amp;ndash; May 9, 1979) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]]-[[Americans|American]] investment banker, businessman and philanthropist, with a career that spanned seventy years.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

For decades Eaton was one of the most powerful financiers in the American Midwest, and he was a colourful and often-controversial figure.&lt;ref name="thinkers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ECH2"/&gt; He was chiefly known for his longevity in business, for his opposition to the dominance of eastern financiers in the America of his day, for his occasionally ruthless financial manipulations, for his passion for world peace and for his outspoken criticism of United States [[Cold War]] policy. He funded and helped organize the first [[Pugwash Conferences]] on World Peace, in 1955.&lt;ref name=thinkers/&gt; He wrote numerous articles and essays on political and economic subjects—"Investment Banking", "Competition or Decadence", "Rationalism Versus Rockefeller", and "A Capitalist Looks at Labour" being some of the best known.&lt;ref&gt;http://speeches.empireclub.org/60606/data&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Eaton was born on December 27, 1883 on a farm near the village of [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia|Pugwash]] in [[Cumberland County, Nova Scotia]], Canada.&lt;ref name="thinkers"/&gt; Besides farming, his father, Joseph Howe Eaton, ran a small general store and the district post office.&lt;ref name="thinkers"/&gt; Cyrus' uncle was [[Charles Aubrey Eaton]].

Eaton left Nova Scotia in 1899 to attend [[McMaster University#History|Woodstock College]], a Baptist-affiliated prep school in [[Woodstock, Ontario]]. Later he enrolled at [[McMaster University]], a [[Baptist]] university, then located in [[Toronto]], where he studied philosophy and finance, intending to enter the Baptist ministry.&lt;ref name="thinkers"/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; He earned his bachelor of arts degree in 1905 with a major in philosophy.&lt;ref name="thinkers"&gt;[http://thinkerslodge.org/history/cyrus-eaton/ Eaton biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-73763-0004, Leipzig, Cyrus S. Eaton im Haus der Wissenschaft.jpg|thumb|Cyrus Eaton in Leipzig, Germany (June 1960)]]

After graduating from McMaster he moved to Cleveland and went to work for the East Ohio Gas Company. This was one of many businesses associated with [[John D. Rockefeller]]. After working with East Ohio Gas and Rockefeller for two years, he established his own business in 1907, developing gas utilities which at the time were relatively underdeveloped and unconsolidated in Canada. He managed to secure natural-gas franchises in Manitoba, Canada representing a group of New York investors. The syndicate was  not able to complete its financing and folded. However, the Manitoba government was sufficiently impressed to allow Eaton to retain the franchises. Eaton formed a new holding company, the Canada Gas &amp; Electric Corp, later consolidated into the Continental Gas &amp; Electric Corp. in 1913.

After spending several years traveling, Eaton settled in Cleveland in 1913 and became active in many businesses. Eaton joined the Otis &amp; Co. banking firm in 1916. In 1926 he set up an investment vehicle organized as Continental Shares, Inc., a closed end trust. In 1927 he formed [[Republic Steel]], the 3rd-largest U.S. steel company. His business had a complex structure which some felt to be too highly leveraged. His 1929 wealth was an estimated $100 million, most of which was lost in the Great Depression.

Eaton rebuilt his fortune in the 1940s and 1950s, becoming a director (1943), then board chairman (1954), of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]]; and also board chairman of the West Kentucky Coal Co. (1953).&lt;ref name=ECH2&gt;http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=ECS1&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on  May 9, 1979 at his home, Acadia Farm, in Northfield, OH.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Alden Whitman]] |coauthors= |title=Cyrus Eaton, Industrialist, 95, Dies.

==Philanthropy==
[[File:Thinkers' Lodge Today.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Thinkers' Lodge, Pugwash, Nova Scotia, Canada; site of the first Pugwash conference in 1957.]]

In 1920, Eaton founded the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name="ECH2"/&gt;

The [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] was issued in [[London]] on July 9, 1955 by [[Bertrand Russell]] in the midst of the [[Cold War]]. It highlighted the dangers posed by [[nuclear weapons]] and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict. The signatories included eleven preeminent [[intellectuals]] and [[scientists]], including [[Albert Einstein]], who signed it just days before his death on April 18, 1955. A few days after the release, philanthropist Eaton offered to sponsor a conference—called for in the manifesto—in [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia]], Eaton's birthplace. This conference was to be the first of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], held in July 1957.

Besides financial support for the Pugwash Conferences, Eaton gave money to support education in Nova Scotia, particularly in Pugwash and to Acadia University. He supported the establishment of a game sanctuary in Nova Scotia on the [[Aspotogan Peninsula]] (his summer home was in [[Blandford, Nova Scotia]] where he had his ashes buried. He donated money for the doors of St. Bartholmus Church in Blandford and 12 acres (4.9 hectares) of land in [[Northfield, Ohio]], for the Lee Eaton Elementary School, named in memory of his daughter. He was also a financial supporter of McMaster University, the [[YWCA]], the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]] and [[Case Western Reserve University]].  At his death in 1979, his Blandford estate was purchased by a group of businessmen from Germany.  His summer home was destroyed in a fire 2015.

===Awards===
[[File:CyrusEatonGraveDeepCoveNovaScotia.jpg|thumb|Cyrus Eaton Gravesite of his ashes, Deep Cove, Nova Scotia]]
Eaton's 1950s efforts at rapprochement with the [[Soviet Union]] won him the 1960 [[Lenin Peace Prize]]. He was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1958, and was the recipient of an honorary degree from [[Bowling Green State University]] in 1969. The Pugwash Conferences and their chairman, [[Joseph Rotblat]], were awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1995.

Eaton married twice; first, in 1907, Margaret House (1887-1956); then Anne Kinder Jones (1922-1992) in 1957. He had seven children: Margaret Grace, Mary Adelle, Elizabeth Ann, Anna Bishop, Cyrus S. Jr., Augusta Farlee, and MacPherson. He died in Ohio and had his ashes buried in Blandford, Nova Scotia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31967">A '''distributed workforce''' is a [[workforce]] that reaches beyond the restrictions of a traditional [[office]] environment. A distributed workforce is dispersed geographically over a wide area – domestically or internationally. By installing key technologies, distributed companies enable employees located anywhere to access all of the company’s resources and software such as applications, data and [[e-mail]] without working within the confines of a [[Brick and mortar business|physical company-operated facility]].

==Description==
This is not a [[virtual business]], where employees are distributed but remain primarily unconnected. A company with a distributed workforce connects its employees using a [[computer networking|networking infrastructure]] that makes it easy for team members across the world to work together. Using a shared software approach called SaaS, or [[software as a service]], workers and teams can share files securely as well as access the company’s [[database]]s, [[file sharing]], [[telecommunications]]/unified communications, [[Customer relationship management]] (CRM), video [[teleconferencing]], [[human resources]], [[information technology|IT]] service management, [[accounting]], IT security, [[world wide web|web]] analytics, web content management, e-mail, calendars and much more.

===History of distributed work===
New technologies are changing important aspects of how we live and work, and the ways we manage distance in the work environment.The management of distance requires more than just technical artifacts. In fact, techniques, [[social conventions]] and [[wikt:norm|norm]]s, organizational structures, and [[institutions]] are also required. In this section, we take a look at the ways ""distributed work"" has evolved over the past several centuries, but we specifically cover the last 50 decades.

Over the 20th century the workplace became increasingly associated with the [[office building]]. In the mid 1900’s, the most prominent business strategy was based on a mechanistic view of office workers as units of production to be housed in a unified and controlling space. Then, in the 1960s the office was seen as a communications system, with the floorplan opening up to facilitate the free flow of information. This office space was designed with the intention of fostering communication and flexible teamwork within the physical location. Then in the 1980s there was a major workplace revolution as the computer moved from the computer room to the desktop. In the 1990s a second workplace revolution saw the introduction of “new ways of working” a response to the realization that information technology was transforming cultural, social, technological and construction processes. At this time, the [[virtual world]] and digital tools reduced the need for synchronous, face-to-face [[communication]] and [[colocation (business)|colocation]] for office workers for the purposes of carrying out defined tasks.This [[digital revolution]] was the convergence between communications and computing technologies which now allows individuals and organizations to connect in ways, and on scales that were previously inconceivable. Today, the new economy is characterized by an increasing virtualization of products, processes, organizations and relationships. The new economy production no longer requires people to work together in the same physical space to access the tools and resources they need to produce their work and allows for distributed work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Andrew|title=Distributed Workplace Sustainable Work Environments|year=2003|publisher=Spon Press|location=London|isbn=020361657X|author2=Wheeler, Paul |author3=Whitehead, Carolyn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reviewing the chapter "Trust and Control in the Hudson's Bay Company in the book "Distributed Work", distributed work has been studied throughout history and not simply since the middle of the 1900s. Between 1670 and 1826, management had to rely on trust and control to successfully manage distributed work. During this time, in addition to dispersed operations that relied heavily on a combination of explicit information and detailed record keeping, more tacit and situated knowledge developed through socialization and participating in life on the Bay.

The Hudson's Bay Company case of distributed work showed a variety of control mechanisms including selection techniques, information requirements, and direct local oversight through its distributed practices of [[socialization]], [[communication]], and [[wikt:participation|participation]]. For example, the elaboration of reporting requirements during the period of inland expansion were used to supplement the current knowledge. A final aspect to note from the HBC case is the senior managements early learning about the strengths and weaknesses of contracts as a means of controlling distant agents. Early on the managers found out that "common sense" was not enough to encourage everyone to comply. Instead, the company's managers created a way to encourage all workers to comply to the businesses norms. All in all the HBC, concludes that trust and control is vital in distributed groups and organizations. HBC suggests that the process and outcome of geographically dispersed work is shaped by the interaction of a number of elements that are more complex, dynamic, and emergent than suggested by the contemporary literature. Thus, it is important to review distributed work prior to its public emergence in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael|first=O'Leary|title=Distributed work Over the Centuries: Trust and. Control in the Hudson's Bay Company, 1670-1826|year=2002|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.

===Key concepts===
There are several key terms associated with collocated work and distributed work. The most important concepts are [[common ground (communication technique)|common ground]], coupling in work, collaboration readiness, and technology readiness. This section will briefly define these four concepts.

'''Common ground''' refers to the knowledge that participants have in common, and they are aware that they have this information in common. Common ground is not just established from some general knowledge about the person’s background, but also through specific knowledge learned from several different cues that are available at the moment, including the person’s appearance and behavior during conversational interactions. The figure below, shows the characteristics that contribute to achieving common ground that are inherent in various communication media.&lt;ref name="Distributed Work"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gary|first1=Olson|title=Distributed Work|year=2000|publisher=Human Computer Interaction|location=University of Michigan|pages=139–178|url=http://kraut.hciresearch.org/sites/kraut.hciresearch.org/files/protected/Olson01-DistanceMatters.pdf|author2=Judith Olson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that those who are remote complain about the difficulty of establishing common ground. This is because when individuals are connected by audio conferencing, it is difficult to tell who is speaking if you do not know the participant well. However, people with video can engage in the subtle negotiation that establishes local common ground- whether what was said was understood or not, whether the conversation can proceed or needs repair. Overall, the more common ground people can establish, the easier the [[communication]] will be and the greater the [[productivity]].

'''Coupling''' refers to the extent and kind of communication required by the work. Tightly coupled work is work that strongly depends on the talents of collections of workers and is nonroutine, and even ambiguous. Components of this type of work are highly interdependent, meaning that the work requires frequent, complex communication among group members, with short feedback loops and multiple streams of information. This type of communication is very difficult in remote locations, mostly because technology does not support rapid back and forth conversations or awareness and repair of ambiguity. On the other hand, loosely coupled work has fewer dependencies or is more routine. It is important that all group members establish common ground about the task, goals, and procedures before working, but this type of work overall requires less frequent or less complicated interactions.

'''Collaboration readiness''' is a groups willingness to work together and share their ideas. Using shared technology assumes that the coworkers need to share information and are rewarded for sharing it. It is important to note that one should not attempt to introduce groupware and remote technologies in organizations and communities that do not have a culture of sharing and collaboration.

Common ground is often used in collaboration, where a team is out to solve a complex problem. In order to solve a complex problem, the different skills and perspectives of members in a team must be pooled together. To do so, the team must make sure that they are on common ground in terms of knowledge and representation of the problem. Care must be taken to note that to achieve common ground when collaborating, differences are constructively managed, rather than downplayed. This is because collaboration differs from compromise.&lt;ref name="Kramer, Robert"&gt;Kramer, Robert. "Collaborating: Finding Common Ground for Multiparty Problems." Academy of Management Review 15.3 (1990): 545-47. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology readiness''' is a company or groups willingness and ability to use technology. Companies require a technical infrastructure if they are going to adopt technologies in the company. In particular, they require the habits, including those of preparation, regular access, attention given to others’ need for information, in order to effectively use the necessary technology for distributed work. Researchers repeatedly see that failure of distributed work often results from attempts to introduce new technologies to organizations or communities that are not yet comfortable with technologies that are already in place. The following chart explains the order in which various collaboration technologies should be adopted in organizations to allow the employees to become familiar with and learn each new technology.&lt;ref name="Distributed Work"/&gt;

The list below shows the observed order in which various collaboration technologies were adopted and used in different organizations.
* Telephone
* Fax
* E-mail
* Audio conferencing
* Voicemail
* E-mail with attachments
* Video conferencing
* Repositories built by others (e.g., intranet sites of static information)
* Shared calendaring
* Creating repositories
* Hand-off collaboration (e.g., using the Tracking Changes option in MS Word)
* Simultaneous collaboration (e.g., NetMeeting, Exceed, or Timbuktu screen sharing)&lt;ref name="kraut.hciresearch.org"/&gt;

As this chart shows, advanced technologies should be introduced in small steps.

These key concepts are important because they help differentiate between collocated and distributed work. Later on a fifth concept of organizational management was proposed.Organizational management is the "practices by which management activities are part of shaping the fundamental premises for collaboration without proximity" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bjørn|first1=Pernille|title=Does Distance Still Matter|year=2014|publisher=Human Computer Interaction|location=IT University of Copenhagen|url=http://orgcom17.hciresearch.org/sites/kraut.hciresearch.org/files/protected/Bjorn14-DoesDistanceStillMatter.pdf|author2=Morten Esbensen|author3=Rasmus Eskild Jensen|author4=Stina Matthiesen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributed vs collocated teams===
There are two types of work that explain the geographical distance between coworkers/collaborators. '''Collocated work''' is the case in which team members are at the same location. '''Distributed work''' is the term used to explain team members who are not in the same physical location when working on a project. There are many differences, similarities, benefits, and obstacles of these two types of work. In order to distinguish between collocated and distributed work, it is necessary to go into more detail.

Collocated work is the case in which the team members are at the same physical location. This may be temporary due to travel to a common location or permanent because all collaborators of the group are at the common work site. Same location means that the coworkers can get to each other’s workspaces with a short walk and communicate via face-to-face interactions. Also, during meetings or small group meetings, a major advantage of collocated work is that individuals are able to move from one meeting to another, simply by overhearing a conversation, seeing what someone is working on, and being aware of how long they had worked on it with or without progress. In addition, during these meetings coworkers can observe someone’s reaction by being able to see his/her gesture or glance. This allows for one to make sure that the group has [[common ground (communication technique)|common ground]] prior to moving on. Also, coworkers have access to common spaces for group interactions and have mutual access to significant shared information. In a study, researchers observed an individual describe something by drawing with his hands in the air. Later, someone referred to “that idea” by pointing to the spot in the air where the first person had “drawn his idea”.

Opposite of collocated work, distributed work is the case in which team members are not physically in the same location. Thus, they are forced to use different methods of technology to communicate to make progress on the project/problem they are working on. Today, the technology distributed work groups use to communicate is constantly changing because of rapid changes and because different groups have varying access to technology. [[Olson &amp; Olson]] describe the options of communication today which include:
* Telephony in its current incarnation
* Meeting room video conferencing
* Desktop video and audio conferencing
* Chat rooms for text interactions
* File transfer
* Application sharing
* Some very primitive virtual reality options

Distributed work can be very successful, if the company or group displays technology readiness. Some of the benefits of distributed work include:
* Simultaneous access to real-time data from instruments around the world, allowing coworkers to talk while something is happening
* [[Microsoft NetMeeting]] has been a success. People who had previously driven long distances to attend a meeting in their area began attending from their offices’. These individuals chose to forego the time and stress of travel in favor of remote participation
* Ongoing work- 1,000 software engineers working on the project in 4 sites. Has allowed numerous people at various different sites to stay in contact over email video and audio conferencing, transferred files and fax. If everyone understands the structure of the collaborative work and knows his or her role, distributed work can be a success.

Distributed work is far from perfect and there are many failures, some of which include:
* Complaints about the quality of communication over audio and video conferencing
* Hard to detect a persons motivation when you are not in the office. For example, if someone had a tough meeting you do not know this and therefore will not know that it is not the right time to send a lengthy, stern email. One important feature of collocation that is missing in remote work is awareness of the state of one’s coworkers, both their presence-absence and their mental state.

Overall, people who have little common ground benefit significantly from having a video channel.&lt;ref name="Distributed Work"/&gt;

===Communication technology===
Effective group communication involves various [[nonverbal communication]] characteristics. Because distance limits interpersonal interaction between members of distributed groups, these characteristics often become constrained. Communication media focuses on alternative ways to achieve these qualities and promote effective [[communication]]. This section addresses communication technology in relation to the theories of grounding and mutual knowledge, and discusses the costs and benefits of various communication technology tools.

'''Grounding and technology'''

[[Grounding in communication]] is the process of updating the evolving common ground, or shared information, between participants. The base of mutual knowledge is important for effective coordination and communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, participants constantly gather various forms of verbal and nonverbal evidence to establish understanding of change and task.

The following are means of grounding and collecting evidence:

{| class=wikitable
|-
! scope="col" | Quality
! scope="col" | Description
|-
! align="center" | Co-presence
|When sharing the same physical environment, participants are able to easily and hear what the other is doing and looking at.
|-
! align="center" | Visibility
|The participants are able to see each other and are able to pick up non-verbal facial cues and body language.
|-
! align="center" | Audibility
|When the participants are able to communicate by speaking, they are able to pick up voice intonation and utterance timing.
|-
! align="center" | Cotemporality
| Efficiency is promoted when an utterance is produced just about when it is received and understood, without delay.
|-
! align="center" | Simultaneity
|Messages can be simultaneously conveyed and received by both participants.
|-
! align="center" | Sequentiality
|The participants speak only with each other without intervening turns from conversations with other people.
|-
! align="center" | Reviewability
|Participants are able to return to a physical form of the exchange at a later time.
|-
! align="center" | Revisability
|Participants are able to privately revise their statements before sending their message.
|}

Different forms of [[communication]] result in the varied presence of these communication characteristics. Therefore, the nature of communication technology can either promote or inhibit grounding between participants. The absence of grounding information results in reduced ability to read and understand social cues. This increases the social distance between them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Clark|title=Grounding in communication|year=1991|publisher=L.B. Resnick, R.M. Levine, &amp; S.D. Teasley|location=Washington, DC|pages=127–149|author2=Brennan, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Costs to grounding change'''

The lack of one of these characteristics generally forces participants to use alternative grounding techniques, because the costs associated with grounding change. There is often a trade-off between the costs- one cost will increase as another decreases. There is also often a correlation between the costs. The following table highlights several of the costs that can change as the medium of communication changes.

'''Examples of Communication Technology'''
 	
- Structured Management (Hinds &amp; Kiesler): It has been argued that work can be adapted to individual situations through task decomposition and version control. This can be applied to distributed groups by allowing groups to divide the work into manageable chunks. Group members can work autonomously and come together to produce a finished product. Many recent software developments have been built to specifically address this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinds|first=Pamela|title=Distributed work|year=2002|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=57–73|author2=Kiesler, Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Email
Email prevents the communication of verbal inferences, such as sarcasm and humor and, additionally, leaves email writers unaware of what their communication is lacking. When people try to anticipate the perspective of their email audience, studies suggest that they end up pulling upon their own experience and perspective instead. This often leads to inconsistencies in email conversation and chaotic communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kruger|first=J|title=Egocentrism over e-mail: Can we communicate as well as we think?|year=2005|publisher=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages=925–936|author2=Epley, N. |author3=Parker, J. |author4=Ng, Z.-W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case Study: Boeing-Rocketdyne SLICE===

'''Background'''
A team made up of a variety of professionals from different companies collaborated from different geographic locations to create an optimized rocket engine. They encountered a variety of challenges and used communication technology tools to plan and execute the project.

'''Task'''

SLICE was tasked with designing a rocket engine at 1/100 the current cost, increase the speed to market by ten times, and increase the rocket engine useful life by three times. Additionally, this team of eight presented their design after 10 months of work, without committing more than 15% of their working time to the project, without collocated meetings and without a common professional ground.

'''Management Practice 1: Strategy-Setting'''

The managers at the three involved companies began the project by spending a year developing an umbrella agreement, the “Continuous Ordering Agreement”, which explicitly defined contractual obligations, the allocation of intellectual property, and the allotment of time the team would have to work on the project. Determining these policies of risk management, project responsibility and funding between companies required a significant level of trust and respect between the teams.

The Continuous Ordering Agreement strategically accomplished three fundamental elements of a successful inter-company team. The team was able to candidly share information without worrying about disclosing company intellectual property, the planning time between idea and project kick-off was significantly reduced, and the team was protected from management changes within their respective companies.

'''Management Practice 2: Technology Use'''

The team primarily used the Internet Notebook, the Project Vault and teleconferences as their methods of collaborative technology. The Internet Notebook allowed the team to securely and remotely access the project and work on and review other ideas simultaneously. The Project Vault was a common file storage and information transfer tool used to promote sharing of all information. Although the team initially planned to use only this written communication, but, due to the overwhelming number of ideas and amount of data, the team began to hold two teleconferences a week. The following table illustrates the capabilities of each method:

In order to maintain efficiency and minimize confusion, the team decided to address their need for knowledge management by retracting the prohibition of face-to-face conversations and instead enforcing a rule of total information sharing. The issue then became the organization and order of ideas, which was not as simply solved. Another issue was the involvement and interaction of team members with their collocated teams. Because the team members were also involved with other projects at their respective companies, they also altered their protocol to allow for interruptions and multitasking during meetings. This unintentionally resulted in the team performing just-in-time analysis and receiving real-time feedback.

'''Management Practice 3: Work Restructuring'''

The team found that the necessary changes to work structure, in order to accommodate virtual collaboration, should be limited as to prevent complications in the fulfillment of basic creative needs. The team specifically identified these needs as consistent and frequent communication between all team members, rapid creation and deletion of information, and a common ground of the task and solutions. SLICE consequently restructured their work to both meet these requirements and enhance the virtual collaboration experience for all members

'''Results'''

After 10 months of working on this project, with no more than 15% of each member's time dedicated to it and each member working from a different geographic location, the team designed an optimized rocket engine with fewer parts(6 parts instead of the normal ~1,200), a 14-fold decrease in manufacturing cost(from $7 million to $0.5 million), and the highest-ever quality performance in the industry. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malhotra|first=Arvind|title=Radical innovation without collocation: A case study at Boeing-Rocketdyne|year=2001|publisher=MIS Quarterly|author2=Majchrzak, Ann |author3=Carman, Robert |author4= Lott, Vern }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distance work in the future===
In the future, design improvements and more horsepower will solve a number of current problems that currently cause limitations of distance technologies. Greater [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] will solve the disruptive influence of today’s delays in audio and video transmission. This will also allow for larger, smoother, more life-size displays of remote workers, making their interaction more similar to the flow of face-to-face interactions. In the future, it is possible that technology will provide capabilities that are in some ways superior to face-to-face options. However, it is likely that problems will result from distributed work technologies and from a lack of knowledge to operate the technologies in the future and face-to-face interactions will not be able to be eliminated completely.&lt;ref name="Distributed Work"/&gt;

It began operations in 1973, assembling Ford models like the [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]], [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]], and [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Granada]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gNRkAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Ford+Lio+Ho+Motor+escort+cortina+granada&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=escort+cortina+granada ''Directory of Taiwan''], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 assembly of the Philippine-made [[Ford Fiera]] [[Basic utility vehicle|AUV]] began, although sales were slow as it was more expensive than its more comfortable Japanese competitors.&lt;ref name=Fiera&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.7car.tw/articles/read/1659 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170429132531/https://www.7car.tw/articles/read/1659 | title = 福特 六和 利大 報紙廣告兩則 | trans-title = Two Ford Lio Ho Fiera newspaper advertisements | language = Chinese | date = 2009-02-25 | archivedate = 2017-04-29 | work = 7car }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, it began assembly of [[Mazda]]-based models, such as the [[Ford Laser|Laser]] ([[Mazda 323]]), [[Ford Telstar|Telstar]] ([[Mazda 626]]) and [[Ford Festiva|Festiva]] ([[Mazda 121]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=l5YSAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Ford+Telstar%22 |title=Japanese Motor Business |publisher=[[Economist Intelligence Unit]] |year=1994 |page=56 |quote=Ford's Taiwanese affiliate, Ford Lio Ho, has been involved in the alliance.

The Taiwan-built [[Ford Laser#Laser (KC) and Meteor (GC)|Laser hatchback]] was exported to [[Canada]] in the late 1980s, badged as the [[Mercury Tracer#First generation (1988–1989)|Mercury Tracer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mtW2AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Ford+Lio+Ho+exports+canada+tracer+five+door&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22mercury+tracers%22++ ''Trade Opportunities in Taiwan''], Volume 15, Issues 1-26, Far East Trade Services, Incorporated, 1987, page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Ford models unique to [[Taiwan]] include the '''Ford Tierra''', based on the Mazda 323 sedan, later rebadged as the facelifted [[Ford Laser]] in other Asian markets, the '''Ford Activa''', a rebadged Mazda 323 sedan and hatchback, and the '''Ford Mondeo Metrostar''' which later also sold in China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/business/asia/2001/08/10/15574/Ford's-Mondeo.htm Ford's Mondeo Metrostar takes lead], Billy Chamberlin, ''[[The China Post]]''

[[File:1990s Taiwan Ford Laser Nobel 1.6J left-end.jpg|thumb|left|1990s Taiwan Ford Laser Nobel]]
Taiwan-market Ford and Mazda vehicles include locally assembled [[Ford Mondeo]], [[Ford Focus (International)|Ford Focus]], [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Ford Escape]], [[Mazda 3]], [[Mazda 5]], and [[Mazda Tribute]]. Also, all 2007 model year Asia/Pacific (except China and South Korean markets) Ford Escapes are assembled by Ford Lio Ho. The Taiwan-assembled Mondeo is also exported to [[China]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. After the ban on diesel-engined passenger cars was lifted in Taiwan in 2004, Ford Liou Ho became the first local manufacturer to build a diesel car. This was a diesel Focus, introduced in August 2007.&lt;ref name=AIPML&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ford Liou Ho Motor, Yulon Motor, China Motor in Taiwan planning to expand exports of complete vehicles | url = http://www.marklines.com/en/report/rep625_200712 | publisher = MarkLines | work = Automotive Information Platform | issue = 625 | date = 2007-11-23 | accessdate = 2012-12-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120315090407/http://www.marklines.com/en/report/rep625_200712 | archivedate = 2012-03-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Ford divested [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and [[Land Rover]] in 2008, and significantly reduced share-holding of [[Mazda]] in 2010, the Taiwanese units of these brands were organized under Ford Liou Ho.

==Ford Lio Ho Design Technology Center==
Ford Lio Ho Design Technology Center or Ford Design &amp; Research Center was built and established by the end of 2002 in Taipei. The Design Technology Center was in charge of products sold mainly within the [[Asian Pacific]] markets including [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[China]], and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile.autonet.com.tw/cgi-bin/file_view.cgi?a1020027010209 Ford Lio Ho Design Technology Center Planned], 邵長玲, ''[[Auto Net]]''

Noticeable products include the 2005 Ford Equator Concept which later spawned the Asian Pacific [[Ford Escape|Ford Escape (ZC)]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.netcarshow.com/ford/2005-equator_concept/ 2005 Ford Equator Concept], "Net car Show"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ford Tierra]], [[Ford Ixion]], [[Ford Mondeo (first generation)#facelift|Ford Mondeo M2000 facelift]], [[Ford Mondeo (second generation)|Ford Mondeo Metrostar]], [[Ford Escape|Ford Escape ZC extensive facelift]] and [[Ford i-Max]]. With the [[Ford i-Max]] being one of the latest products designed by Lio Ho, the Design Technology Center was shut down due to the one Ford strategy.

'''Good Deeds Day''' is an international day of [[volunteering]]. Beginning in 2007, its mission is to unite people from around the world in doing good deeds for others and the planet.

==Background==

This day of [[community service]] was launched in 2007 in [[Israel]] by businesswoman and [[philanthropist]], [[Shari Arison]], through [[Ruach Tova]], a [[Nonprofit organization]] that connects between people who want to volunteer and organizations in need of assistance.

Speaking about the day, initiator Shari Arison said: 
{{Quote|text= I believe that if people will think good, speak good and do good, the circles of goodness will grow in the world. Good Deeds Day has become the leading day of giving and this year individuals, school children, students, soldiers and employees from many businesses are joining in for the annual Good Deeds Day with the aim of doing a good deed for others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel21c.org/900000-people-take-part-in-good-deeds-day/ 900,000 people take part in Good Deeds Day (Israel21c)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==

Approximately 7,000 people participated in Israel in 2007. The day became global in 2011, with participants from around the world, including in the USA, [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]. In 2012, project organizers teamed up with [[MTV]] Global for a six-week-campaign on its online and TV platforms, exposing the message to 24 million viewers around the world. In 2014, [[NASDAQ]] invited Shari Arison to kick off Good Deeds Day in the trading day closing bell ceremony. 2017 marked the fourth year in a row of the NASDAQ and Good Deeds Day collaboration.

Good Deeds Day 2018 will be on Sunday, April 15, 2018.

In 2017, the 11th annual Good Deeds Day, approximately 2,500,000 participants from 93 countries volunteered, marking it the largest and most global day yet. To celebrate, project organizers held mega events in Kenya, Portugal, Italy, Poland and more.

Good Deeds Day and Ruach Tova are part of The [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927194639/http://www.arison.co.il/AFFHome.aspx?Lang=2 Ted Arison Family Foundation], the philanthropic arm of the Arison Group.

==Around the world==

In 2011, international companies [http://en.shikunbinui.co.il/ Shikun &amp; Binui] and [[Bank Hapoalim]] were among the first international participants in Good Deeds Day outside of Israel. As of 2016, Good Deeds Day is celebrated in 75 countries worldwide, and has collaborated with major cities such as Rome, São Paulo, Kaohsiung City, and New York City to create special events. In the Good Deeds Day event at Herald Square, New York City, actor and activist [[Adrian Grenier]] supported the day by speaking at the event:
{{Quote|It’s important to have a day in which we acknowledge wonderful people who are dedicated to doing good.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtlwCohKXqY&amp;&amp;t=58s/ Adrian Grenier speaks in the 2016 Good Deeds Day Event at Herald Square, New York City (Youtube)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Pope Francis]] endorsed the day in his Sunday sermon prior to Good Deeds Day 2015 in Rome and said:
{{Quote|I send my wishes to the numerous groups of volunteers that have united to show solidarity by doing good deeds that promote a better society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shariarison.com/en/content/pope-honors-good-deeds-day/ Pope honors Good Deeds Day (Shari Arison)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2016 Good Deeds Day collaborated with [[Brazil]] based volunteering center Atados on a nationwide activation. Together they reached 10,000 volunteers around the country, and 40 cities across Brazil including major cities like [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brasília]], and [[São Paulo]].

In [[Latin America]], major Good Deeds Day events took place in Panama, Costa Rica, Brazil, Peru, and 16 other countries in the region.

In [[Taiwan]], Good Deeds Day collaborated with TAVE (Taiwan Association for Volunteer Effort) to create major citywide activities in [[Kaohsiung City]], Taiwan in 2016. Taiwan’s Vice President, [[Chen Chien-jen]], and Kaohsiung’s Mayor, [[Chen Chu]], were among the government officials honoring the day in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwanhot.net/?p=81289 (TaiwanHot, in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taoyuan City]] also hosted citywide activities, arranged by Taoyuan City Volunteer Service Association and other partnering organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nownews.com/n/2016/05/05/2089169 (Now News, in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest collaborations in [[Europe]] include SPES (Associazione Promozione e Solidarietà) in Italy, who organized a major Good Deeds Day event in Rome in 2016. Good Deeds Day invited runners in the [[Rome Marathon]] to join the “Roma Fun Run” and visit the Good Deeds Day fair of non-profits at the finish line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insiemeperilbenecomune.org/ (Insieme per il bene comune, in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Israel===

Good Deeds Day (Hebrew: יום מעשים טובים) first began in Israel in 2007 with 7,000 participants and grew to 1,500,000 in 2016. Local municipalities, companies, and nonprofit organizations all around the country participate by organizing special activities in their communities, renovating or painting buildings, building community gardens, and volunteering in many other ways for populations in need. Cities such as [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]] also host special Good Deeds Day events that are open to the public, such as the 2016 “Counselor’s Boulevard” that took place on [[Rothschild Boulevard]], Tel Aviv. Professionals gave free counseling sessions to passersby. Other public events include the 2015 Good Deeds Day nonprofit Fair at [[Rabin Square]], Tel Aviv, and [[Ashkelon]], which included hair donation stands, dog adoption area, and a give-and-take market.

'''Hartham Park''' is a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[manor house]] in Wiltshire, England, about {{convert|1+1/4|mi|km}} north of the town of [[Corsham]]. Originally designed by [[James Wyatt]], and set today in {{convert|50|acres}}, it has within its grounds a [[stické tennis]] court. The house and nearby buildings were developed as a private business park in the late 1990s, although the house retains its Georgian facade and look.

==History==
Hartham Park is first recorded in the [[Domesday Book]],&lt;ref name=BestLoved&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestloved.com/attractions/hartham-park-in-corsham-wiltshire-west-country-england-uk.php|title=Hartham Park|publisher=Best Loved|accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was owned from the 15th century by the Goddard family. In 1790, following the death of her husband [[Sir William James, 1st Baronet|Commodore Sir William James]], Chairman of the [[East India Company]], Lady Anne James (née Goddard) decided to move from [[Eltham]], London to [[Wiltshire]]. She commissioned architect [[James Wyatt]] to remove the existing farm house and redevelop the property. Completed in 1795, Lady James died before its hand-over. Although her house is at the centre of the current property, it is largely obscured or altered as a result of later developments.&lt;ref name=Jacks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksrestaurantandbar.co.uk/index.php?id=132|title=History of Hartham Park|publisher=Jack's Restaurant &amp; Bar|accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently leased out, in 1800 it was the birthplace of [[Sir Alexander Malet, 2nd Baronet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Malet, Charles Warre|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joy family===
In 1816, the estate was purchased from the Goddard family trust by American exile Michael Joy, who through his sympathies for the British during the [[American War of Independence]] found it impossible to remain in North America. In the 1830s his son Henry Hall Joy undertook a land swap with Sir Benjamin Hobhouse, in which he took ownership of the adjacent Hartham House, which had historically been owned by the Duckett family. In his subsequent redevelopment of the estate, Hall Joy added an ice house to Hartham Park, which subsequently served as an [[air raid shelter]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He also incorporated the gates of Hartham House into the entrance of Hartham park, so that the Duckett family crest still appears on the iron entrance gates.&lt;ref name=Jacks/&gt; Henry Hall Joy died in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Register of Deaths for St George's Hanover Square registration district, July-September 1840, Volume 1, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poynder family===
[[File:Hartham Park , Wilts – The new water garden (5242126491).jpg|thumb|The new water garden, 1903]]
In the 1850s, the estate was bought by Thomas Henry Allen Poynder, and passed on his death to his brother, William Henry Poynder. On his death, the estate passed to his nephew, [[John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington|John Dickson Poynder]], who on the death of his uncle Sir Alexander Collingwood Thomas Dickson became the sixth baronet Dickson of Hardingham Hall.

Sir John became [[Chippenham (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Chippenham]] in 1892, and a Member of [[London County Council]] from 1898 to 1904. He also served in the [[Second Boer War]] as aide-de-campe to Commander in Chief [[Paul Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen]], winning a [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] in 1900. He then chaired the [[Islington Commission]]. Appointed Governor of [[New Zealand]] in 1910, he was raised to the peerage as [[Lord Islington]]. After two years he returned to become first Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies and then Under Secretary of State for India.&lt;ref name=Jacks/&gt;

From the start of his ownership, Baron Islington began to remodel Hartham Park. The house was remodelled and the grounds were landscaped by [[Harold Peto]], including a Dutch [[water garden]], subsequently largely overbuilt in a 1960s redevelopment. Hartham also became a focal point for political and recreational life in North Wiltshire, with records showing numerous stays for his friends [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], the third son of [[Queen Victoria]] who enjoyed the local [[Game (food)|game]] shooting.&lt;ref name=Jacks/&gt;

===Stické tennis===
{{main|Stické}}
In 1904, Lord Islington commissioned the construction of a wooden [[stické tennis]] court, northwest of the house. Started in an artillery building at the gunnery range at [[Shoeburyness]], Essex in 1877, courts were built throughout the [[British Empire]], and particularly in country houses. But after World War One, no further courts were built and the sport's popularity waned. Today Hartham Park's court is one of only three remaining in the world, the others being located at:
*[[Knightshayes Court]] in [[Tiverton, Devon]], England
*[[Viceroy of India]]'s summer palace, now the [[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]], [[Shimla]], Himachal Pradesh, India

===The Second World War and after===
Lord Islington sold Hartham Park following his purchase of [[Rushbrooke Hall]], Suffolk in 1922. Subsequently, Hartham Park estate was purchased by the [[J&amp;W Nicholson &amp; Co]]. family of [[gin]] makers, who took up residence during the [[Second World War]]. From the time of the [[Battle of Britain]] onwards, the upper floors were used as dormitories housing one hundred members of the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] from the [[Royal Air Force]]'s [[No. 10 Group RAF|No. 10 Group]], [[RAF Fighter Command]], based at the nearby [[RAF Rudloe Manor]].&lt;ref name=Jacks/&gt;

Sold again in the 1960s, the house has since been used as corporate offices, initially as the headquarters of the [[Bath Stone|Bath and Portland Stone]] company.&lt;ref name=Jacks/&gt;

==Present==
Bought in 1997, Hartham Park was redeveloped into a business park. The main house and adjoining buildings enclose 90 sub-let serviced offices.

'''Don Henry Canoy''' (November 1, 1923 &amp;ndash; May 16, 2008) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] businessman and founder of [[Radio Mindanao Network]].

Canoy was born in [[Cagayan de Misamis]], [[Misamis (province)|Misamis Province]] into a family of teachers and traders.

In 1952 Canoy started the DXCC radio station, this was Cagayan de Oro's first radio station. Canoy wanted to use radio for [[public broadcasting]] to inform, educate and also entertain listeners. Up until this time the main source of news for most Filipinos came from [[Manila]] based newspapers. &lt;br&gt;
Canoy went on to open up many more local radio stations throughout the Philippines, together these stations formed the Radio Mindanao Network.

In 2002 Philippines President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Gloria Arroyo]] praised Canoy for his achievements in and contributions to [[broadcast journalism]]. &lt;br&gt;After Canoy's death President Arroyo released a statement praising his legacy, {{cquote|''Henry Canoy elevated local radio as exponents of rural progress and development. His legacy in the field of broadcast journalism goes beyond the airwaves of Radio Mindanao Network (RMN) and into the realm of genuine service to the country''}}
.

==Personal life==
He was married to Maria Clara Suniel-Canoy. He has six children, respectively Eric, Rebecca, Ike aka "Butch", Charley, Tessa and Harriet.

'''Hot melt coating''' is the application of a layer to a substrate by pre-melting the desired material and then allowing or forcing the material to cool, solidifying the layer.  The process is widely used in industry, particularly for [[pressure-sensitive adhesive]]s on thin substrates- self-adhesive [[label]]s.

==Introduction==
[[Coating]] is the application of a layer to a substrate.  In general, in order for a thin uniform layer to be applied, the application must be done at low or moderate viscosities.  In many cases this low viscosity is achieved by dissolving or dispersing the desired coating in a liquid such as water or a solvent, but this then necessitates the subsequent removal of the liquid by, for instance, a drying process. 
Hot-melt coating achieves this low to moderate viscosity by melting the desired material before applying it to the substrate.    The substrate and coated layer are then cooled, generally by passing over a chilled roller.   There is no liquid to remove, so the process is, in principle, much faster than water- or solvent-based equivalents.

==Terminology &amp; use==
The process has been used so extensively for the application of adhesive layers by slot-die coating that the use of the term ‘hot melt’ often implies slot-die coating, but hot melt methods have also been used for other coating processes, such as metering rod or roller coating.

==Transfer coating==
If the desired substrate is too temperature-sensitive to allow direct hot-melt coating, the product may be made by coating a transfer belt which is then brought into contact with the substrate after cooling: if the relative adhesion is correct then the coating will transfer to the new substrate from the transfer belt.

'''Howard Richards''' (born June 10, 1938) is a [[philosophy|philosopher]] of [[Social Science]] who works with the concepts of ''basic cultural structures''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Richards [http://www.howardri.org/Let60.html What the World Needs Now]. Cultural action to transform the basic structures of the modern world is a general concept that unites most of Richards' writing - see: Richards (2014): [http://unboundedorganization.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chapter-One-Rosario.pdf Unbounded Organization] p. 1 and 8. ''Methods for Transforming the  Structures of the Modern World'' is the subtitle of Vol.II of {{harvnb|Richards|1994}}  ''Letters from Quebec''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''constitutive rules''.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;
Constitutive rule, a key concept rooted in the work of [[John Searle]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and in Richards' Oxford tutor [[Rom Harré]]'s rules-oriented approach to the explanation of social behavior. One can find a good description of what Prof Richards understands by ''Constitutive Rules'' in his 2010 speech at the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA)  [http://howardrichards.org/peace4us/humanizing-methodologies-in-transformation/ Humanizing Methodologies in Transformation].&lt;/ref&gt; He holds the title of Research Professor of Philosophy at [[Earlham College]], a [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Richmond, Indiana]], United States, the Quaker School where he taught for thirty years. He officially retired from Earlham College, together with his wife Caroline Higgins in 2007, but retained the title of Research Professor of Philosophy. He has a PhD in Philosophy from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1974}} (Santa Barbara PhD Dissertation).&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) from the [[Stanford Law School]], an Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) from [[Oxford University]] (UK) and a PhD in Educational Planning &lt;ref&gt;With a first field in Curriculum Planning and a second field in [[Applied Psychology]] and [[Moral Education]] with a doctoral thesis on the Chilean PPH (Parents and Children) Project, published as "''The Evaluation of Cultural Action''" ({{harvnb|Richards|1984}}).&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] (OISE), [[University of Toronto]], Canada. He now teaches at the [[University of Santiago, Chile]],&lt;ref&gt;On the doctoral program in [[Management Science]] and the undergraduate program in Ingeneria Comercial (Economics).&lt;/ref&gt; and has ongoing roles at the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA) &lt;ref&gt;
[http://rur.pascalobservatory.org/sites/default/files/dst_nrf_sarchi_development_education_trajectory_2013_v21_pascal.pdf Development Education] p.3 ; [http://www.unisa.ac.za/default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=22551 School of Human Sciences].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Cape Town]]'s Graduate School of Business program.  He is founder of the Peace and Global Studies Program&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The name of the Program has varied over the years from Peace Studies to Peace and Conflict Studies and then, continuing until now, Peace and Global Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder of the Business and Nonprofit Management Program at Earlham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pascalobservatory.org/users/howard-richards Howard Richards] profile.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Howard Richards was born in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. [[California]], United States, the eldest child of Kenneth F. Richards, a truck mechanic, originally from [[Connecticut]], and his wife Donna.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;(McCune)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was his mother's intellectual interest in philosophers such as [[Henri Bergson]] which prompted the family to break its ties with [[mormon]]ism. His paternal grandparents fell into unemployment in Connecticut during the [[Great Depression]] and moved to Pasadena in 1932. It was his uncle Jack from his mother's side, who died during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;p 257 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kw5vLbYq-4C&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq=howard+richards+uncle+Jack&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b12zT_qO9A&amp;sig=1WNK9Bn5ot8Sft8kvdofeKXL80&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMIx8Kol5GyxwIVCTnbCh3KMgfV#v=onepage&amp;q=howard%20richards%20uncle%20Jack&amp;f=false Understanding the Global Economy] and under "The Holocaust" in [http://www.howardri.org/logicalpeaceplan.html Richards], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially his mother who fostered his early intellectual interest.&lt;ref&gt;see eg [http://lists.topica.com/lists/CERJ/read/message.html?sort=d&amp;mid=1721114650&amp;start=0 TOPICA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic background==
After graduating from [[Redlands High School]], CA, in June 1956, Richards enrolled in the same year as a Philosophy undergraduate at [[Yale University|Yale]]. Being a top student, he was allowed to skip one year of the normal three year Major in Philosophy course. Afterwards he was admitted  to [[Stanford Law School]] in 1958, graduating with a Juris Doctor ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) degree in 1961. Later in that year he enrolled in graduate school at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]], earning an M.A. in Philosophy there in 1964 with a thesis on [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1963}} (MA Philosophy Thesis).&lt;/ref&gt;  Simultaneously he worked at the [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]] think tank where he contributed several articles to the in-house Center Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;a.o. an article entitled  "A normative Economics" - see [http://www.howardri.org/Bib.html Richards Bibliography] Articles.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 he left for Chile, where they ultimately would settle in the town of [[Limache]]. Soon after their arrival, Howard took up the post of Dean of Studies at the [[Santiago College]], (a college in Chile is a secondary school). While in [[Santiago]], Howard joined the Chilean Ministry of Education as an advisor to President [[Eduardo Frei Montalva|Eduardo Frei]]'s Educational Reform, working on a Secondary Curriculum influenced by the ideas of the Brazilian Educator [[Paulo Freire]]&lt;ref&gt;CPEIP-MINEDUC -  Centro de Perfeccionamiento, Experimentación e Investigaciones Pedagógicas. Ministerio de la Educación.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1970 Richards and his family left for the UK where Richards enrolled for an Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) at [[Oxford University]], simultaneously doing one on one tutorials and attending seminars by the philosophers [[Rom Harré]] and [[A. J.

==Law practice==
Richards was the first volunteer attorney for [[Cesar Chavez]]'s [[United Farm Workers of America]], protecting the union's funds against grower lawsuits.&lt;ref name="Journal Labor"/&gt;   In 1983 he became member of the American Bankruptcy Institute.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1989 he  started practicing law in Santa Barbara, joining the [http://www.lafsbc.org/ Legal Aid Foundation] and specializing in bankruptcy,&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.nacba.org/ National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys](NACBA).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he also was a voluntary attorney at the [http://www.lafla.org/ Los Angeles Free Clinic],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justia.com/lawyers/california/goleta?page=2 Justicia] members.&lt;/ref&gt; a practice he wound up in 2004, when he moved back to [[Limache]], Chile.

==Major works and ideas==
* In his first major work, ''The Evaluation of Cultural Action'' (1984),&lt;ref name="RichardsEs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RichardsEn"/&gt; Richards ''"unveils throughout the text the rationale for using an 'illuminative' approach (Parlett and Hamilton, 1974) rather than a conventional 'systems' assessment"''.&lt;ref name="Beatrice"/&gt; The long dialogue with a "reasonable social scientist" gravitates around how to evaluate education and community development efforts inspired by the Brazilian adult educationist [[Paulo Freire]]'s philosophy, combined with an empirical study of one such effort, namely PPH (Parents and Children Program) that flourished among peasants in the south of Chile in the 1970s and 1980s.
* Richards' two-volume ''Letters from Quebec: a Philosophy for Peace and Justice'' (1994)  &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1994}}, Bloomberg books, also published by [http://www.gamutbooks.org/cf71y_letters-from-quebec-a-philosophy-for-peace-and-justice-pdf.pdf International Scholars Press, 1996]. ''Letters from Quebec Vol 1 &amp; 2'' can be read online on [https://www.scribd.com/doc/184024951/Howard-Richards-Letters-From-Quebec-vols-1-2-pdf#scribd Scribd].&lt;/ref&gt; aspires to be both literary entertainment and a history of [[rationality]] in western culture and philosophy, illuminating the possibilities for transformative and humanistic action. The subtitle of volume Two of ''Letters from Quebec'' is  'Methods for Transforming the  Structures of the Modern World'. Taking leads from [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], the philosopher is seen - borrowing a phrase from [[Paulo Freire]] - as a 'cultural activist' who invents rationalities.
*  Building on the premise that standards of [[rationality]] are historically [[social construct|constructed]] social norms, he went on, in ''Understanding the Global Economy'' (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|2004}} (Peace Education Books) was originally published by [https://books.google.com/books/about/Understanding_the_global_economy.html?id=8yQPAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Maadhyam] in 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; to argue that causal explanations in economics invariably rely, as premises, on cultural norms, and particularly on constitutive rules &lt;ref&gt;"Constitutive rules constitute (and also regulate) an activity the existence of which is logically dependent on the rules." [http://howardrichards.org/peace4us/humanizing-methodologies-in-transformation/ Richards, 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; Richards proposes to understand institutions by following out the consequences of the rules that organize them. ''Understanding the Global Economy'' reviews the principal schools of economic thought with respect to the causal explanations they offer of the phenomena of today's global economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Betty Reardon]], ([http://www.howardri.org/reardon.html foreword]).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Dilemmas of Social Democracies: Overcoming Obstacles to a More Just World'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|Swanger|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-authored with Joanna Swanger, applies the philosophical ideas of Richards' earlier works,  particularly a concept of  basic cultural structure,&lt;ref&gt;Basic cultural structure: see eg Richards [http://www.howardri.org/Let60.html What the World Needs Now].&lt;/ref&gt; - where 'basic' identifies those cultural structures that govern the satisfaction of the [[basic needs]] of life  - to historical case studies of Spain,  Sweden,  Austria,  South Africa, Indonesia, Venezuela, and the World Bank. The upshot is that [[social democracy]] is not feasible with the framework provided by the [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kw5vLbYq-4C&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=constitutive+rules+richards+howard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b12xUSpKeA&amp;sig=u909sw7jg_vICvEW5_ExayXE9gU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAmoVChMI1NTNibz4xgIVqZbbCh1ZJQvj#v=onepage&amp;q=constitutive%20rules%20richards%20howard&amp;f=false constitutive rules] of modernity.

* ''Gandhi and the Future of Economics'' (2011) &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|Swanger|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "makes a case for incorporating [[Gandhi]]'s insights into mainstream economics. ''Gandhi and the Future of Economics'' is not meant to be a research study of Gandhian economics. It is rather that kind of felicitous publication that breathes new life into a known theme, and, in doing so, brings out its implications for [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. It does all this in dialogue with a set of contemporary thinkers and actors from the Indian sub-continent: [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[Amartya Sen]], [[Arundhati Roy]], [[Manmohan Singh]]." ([http://liveencounters.net/?page_id=6537 Ivo Coelho]).
*  ''The Nurturing of Time Future'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines itself as "a short book about everything", addressed to educated people of good will who see the need for paradigmatic change. It proposes a philosophy in the old-fashioned sense of articulating a synthesis of the social and natural sciences that provides an overall framework for deciding what to do. It is a '[[belles lettres]]' exercise written in the style of [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smirkingchimp.com/thread/jane-stillwater/43241/america-losing-its-true-moral-compass Jane Stillwater] (review)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Rethinking Thinking: Modernity's "Other" and the transformation of the University'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoppers|Richards|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  co-authored with [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=27341 Catherine Hoppers], further develops  a theme found in early works – that modernity has much to learn from pre-modernity. It includes an account of how the constitutive rules of markets presupposed by economics developed in [[Roman Law]].  They are contrasted with indigenous African cultural norms. ''Rethinking'' also argues that bringing modernity's "other" into the curriculum of the university will transform the curriculum, transform research and transform [[community engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/cpi/article/download/22935/17082 T. Pilay] and [http://www.litnet.co.za/rethinking-thinking-modernitys-other-and-the-transformation-of-the-university/ van der Westhuizen] (reviews).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Richards' most recent book ''Unbounded Organizing in Community'' (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|Richards|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-authored with Gavin Andersson of South Africa's [http://www.seriti.org.za/ Seriti Institute], offers a combination of a down to earth, practical guide to doing community organizing inspired by the [[Organization Workshop]]s of [[Clodomir Santos de Morais]], with an elementary introduction to Andersson's theory of  [http://www.seriti.org.za/index.php/unbounded-organization unbounded organization].

'''''In Defense of Global Capitalism''''' (in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Till världskapitalismens försvar'') is a book by [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer [[Johan Norberg]] promoting [[economic globalization]] and [[free trade]]. The book was originally published in May 2001 by the Swedish think tank [[Timbro]]. Since then, a number of translations into other languages have followed.

In the book, Norberg examines the arguments put forward by the [[anti-globalization movement]]. According to Norberg, "the diffusion of capitalism in the last decades has lowered [[Measuring poverty|poverty rates]] and created opportunities for individuals all over the world. [[Standard of living|Living standards]] and [[life expectancy]] has risen fast in most places. World hunger, [[infant mortality]], and [[Economic inequality|inequality]] have diminished. This is because of economic and technological development that is the result of [[free market]] policies. The poor countries that have [[Liberalization|liberalized]] their economies have shown impressive results, while those that have not are stuck in deep misery. Therefore, we need more capitalism and globalisation if we want a better world, not less".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johannorberg.net/?page=indefense_about |title=Summary of In Defence of Global Capitalism |accessdate=2008-02-18 |publisher=JohanNorberg.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, the book has been translated into a dozen of languages including: English, German, Dutch, Turkish, Estonian, French, Finnish, Spanish, Chinese, Polish, and Czech.&lt;ref name=lang1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johannorberg.net/?page=indefense_lang |title=Foreign language editions |accessdate=2008-02-18 |publisher=JohanNorberg.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional translations are available in Arabic, Russian and Mongolian.&lt;ref name=lang2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johannorberg.net/?page=news |title=News |accessdate=2008-02-18 |publisher=JohanNorberg.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was also the basis for the [[Channel 4]] 2003 documentary film ''[[Globalisation is Good]]'', which was presented by Norberg.

== Reviews ==
[[Nick Gillespie]], editor-in-chief of ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', wrote on the book: "A powerful moral and economic case for globalization. Norberg throws rhetorical Molotov cocktails both at left-wing critics who would condemn developing countries to poverty by insisting on First World workplace and environmental standards as a prerequisite for trade and at Western governments whose free market rhetoric is shamefully undercut by draconian tariffs on textiles and agriculture, the two areas in which the developing world can actually compete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Gillespie |authorlink=Nick Gillespie |title=Poor man's hero: controversial writer Johan Norberg champions globalization as the best hope for the developing world |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_7_35/ai_110361468|publisher=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |date=December 2003 |accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Brittan]] of ''[[Financial Times]]'' wrote:
"Giving clear and verifiable sources, he nails one by one the fallacies and selective statistics that are used by the anti-capitalist protesters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Samuel |last=Brittan |authorlink=Samuel Brittan |title=Capitalism, global and local |url=http://www.samuelbrittan.co.uk/text98_p.html |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |date=2001-12-17 |accessdate=2008-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307232209/http://www.samuelbrittan.co.uk/text98_p.html |archivedate=2008-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anne Applebaum]] of ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote: "Johan Norberg makes the case that free trade is good for the developing world, good for freedom, good for social progress, even if the dull old Marxists refuse to see it. It can be no accident that not one but two glamorous young pro-capitalists have emerged in Europe over the past year. [Norberg and France's [[Sabine Herold]]] ...the [anti-globalization] movement has in recent years provided a cushion for those politicians – European, American, Japanese and developing world alike -- who drag their feet about opening markets. Maybe now, if the young, the hip and the free-thinking start pushing the other way, the ministers in their suits will be forced to listen too".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Anne |last=Applebaum |authorlink=Anne Applebaum |title=The New Radical Chic |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51927-2003Sep9.html |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date=2003-09-10 |accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Stein]], former speechwriter for U.S. Presidents [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]], wrote: "Johan Norberg's book is a stunningly insightful, brilliantly detailed refutation of the crank theories of the anti-globalists. ''In Defense of Global Capitalism'' is a shining example of what a gifted mind can do working with the truth to advance the cause of capitalism, which in the end is the cause of every decent man and woman".&lt;ref name=reviews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johannorberg.net/?page=indefense_rev |title=Reviewers' opinions |accessdate=2008-02-18 |publisher=JohanNorberg.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William H. Peterson of ''[[Washington Times]]'' wrote: "I hail him [Norberg] for making his case for globalization with solid facts, statistics, bar-charts, and lots of flesh-and-blood examples drawn from his travels."&lt;ref name=reviews/&gt;

Dave O'Brien of ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' called Norberg "Europe's answer to our own [[Naomi Klein]]"&lt;ref name=reviews/&gt; and Jacqueline Thorpe of the Canadian ''[[National Post]]'' wrote: "It is a sweet irony that the task of defending global capitalism from the likes of Canada´s own Naomi 'No Logo' Klein has fallen on the shoulders of a pony-tailed Swede who started out as an anarchist obsessed with goth music and black clothes. But it is a role Johan Norberg, author of In Defence of Global Capitalism and at 30, every bit as good-looking as left-wing pin-up Ms Klein, has easily morphed into. ...His book, which won the Antony Fisher Memorial Award in 2002, counters anti-globalization arguments with facts, figures, but mostly common sense".&lt;ref name=reviews/&gt;

Former chairman of the [[National Bank of Poland]] [[Leszek Balcerowicz]] wrote: "The liberal cause has obtained a powerful communicator, Mr Johan Norberg from Sweden. He combines mastery of facts and a deep understanding of theories, with the gift of lucid and emotionally moving argumentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leszek |last=Balcerowicz |authorlink=Leszek Balcerowicz |url=http://www.hayek-stiftung.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Preisverleihungen/2003/balcerowicz.pdf |title=Laudatio in honour of the recipients of Friedrich Hayek Prize, 2003 |date=2003-10-12 |accessdate=2008-02-18 |publisher=[[Friedrich-August-von-Hayek-Stiftung]] |format=[[PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227231630/http://www.hayek-stiftung.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Preisverleihungen/2003/balcerowicz.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish Professor of Philosophy and socialist [[Torbjörn Tännsjö]] wrote: "Johan Norberg has written an agreeable book in defence of capitalism and globalisation... Even in labour movement discussion circles I think it would repay close study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Torbjörn |last=Tännsjö |authorlink=Torbjörn Tännsjö |title=Ett sympatiskt försvar för världskapitalismen |url=http://lotidningen.lo.se/?id_site=8&amp;id_category=336&amp;id_item=14237&amp;criteria=johan%20norberg |publisher=[[LO-Tidningen]] |date=2001-09-28 |accessdate=2008-02-19 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which states:

The Independent Online Booksellers Association promotes independent online bookselling by:

*  Fostering consumer awareness of online book buying.
*  Interacting with businesses, organizations, and governmental entities that affect online bookselling.
*  Providing programs and services that will help member booksellers to strengthen their businesses.

===Professional standards===
The IOBA provides resources to booksellers and the general public that promote professionalism and transparency in book descriptions and the selling process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Greg|title=The Naval Chronicle|url=http://bookmanslog.blogspot.com/2011/03/naval-chronicle-complete-in-40-volumes.html|work=Bookman's Log|publisher=Bookman's Log|accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include a Code of Ethics to which members are required to adhere, guidelines for book condition descriptions, definitions of book-related terms and abbreviations, and an annotated list of reference works useful to booksellers and book buyers.

===Professional development===
IOBA supports professional education for booksellers, and offers an annual scholarship contest. The 2010 contest offered two full-tuition scholarships with a stipend for travel expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; One of these scholarships was reserved for the Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar (CABS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The other scholarship could be used at CABS, the [[Rare Book School]] (RBS),  the California Rare Book School (CalRBS) or the London Rare Book School.

IOBA publishes an online magazine called ''The Standard'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = The Standard
  | publisher = IOBA
  | url = http://www.ioba.org/newsletter/archive.html
  | accessdate = June 19, 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; with articles pertinent to the bookselling trade and to collectors. It is primarily written by the membership to share their experiences and expertise, but it is available to the general public.

===Customer Trust===
IOBA reassures customers with a Book Buyer's Bill of Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; that guarantees accurate descriptions, reasonable shipping costs, and a satisfaction guaranteed return policy.

===Related organizations===
IOBA monitors organizations that affect online bookselling and sends alerts to its own members, or writes letters on behalf of the IOBA membership. For example,  in December 2009, IOBA issued a warning advisory to members about changing description standards on Half.com that could jeopardize a sellers Half.com and eBay accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7963">The '''Industry Classification Benchmark''' (ICB) is an [[industry classification]] [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] launched by [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] and [[FTSE Group|FTSE]] in 2005 and now owned solely by FTSE International.  It is used to segregate markets into [[List of recognized economic sectors|sectors]] within the [[macroeconomy]].  The ICB uses a system of 10 industries, partitioned into 19 supersectors, which are further divided into 41 sectors, which then contain 114 subsectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbenchmark.com|title=Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB)|author=|date=21 June 2017|website=icbenchmark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbenchmark.com/ICBDocs/ICB_%20Product_Spec_Nov2011.pdf Industry Classification Benchmark structure] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICB is used globally (though not universally) to divide the market into increasingly specific categories, allowing investors to compare industry trends between well-defined subsectors.  The ICB replaced the legacy [[FTSE Group|FTSE]] and [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] classification systems on 3 January 2006, and is used today by the [[NASDAQ]], NYSE and several other markets around the globe. All ICB sectors are represented on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] except Equity Investment Instruments (8980) and Nonequity Investment Instruments (8990).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nyse.com/indexes/nyaindex.csv&lt;/ref&gt;

Dow Jones divested itself of its 50% interest in the ICB in 2011 and announced it was creating its own version of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.djindexes.com/index.php/dow-jones-indexes-divests-its-50-interest-in-industry-classification-benchmark-2/|title=Dow Jones Indexes Divests Its 50% Interest in Industry Classification Benchmark|publisher=Dow Jones Indexes|format=press release|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4802">[[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]] is considered as one of the most critical areas in [[finance]]; it plays a key role in many areas of [[finance]] such as buy/sell, [[solvency]], [[merger]] and [[Takeover|acquisition]].

==Rationale==
There are numerous individual reasons or motivations for conducting an intellectual property valuation or economic [[Economic appraisal|appraisal]] analysis. A valuation is prepared, for example, for [[Financial transaction|transactions]], [[pricing]] and strategic purposes, [[financing]] [[securitization]] and [[collateralization]], [[tax]] planning and [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]], and litigation support.

==Factors driving the value of intellectual property==

Intellectual property derives its value from a wide range of significant parameters such as [[market share]], [[barriers to entry]], legal protection, IP’s profitability, [[Industry|industrial]] and [[economic]] factors, growth projections, remaining economic life, and new [[technologies]].

== Approaches==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}
The valuation process necessitates gathering much more information as well as in-depth understanding of [[economy]], [[industry]], and specific business that directly affect the value of the [[intellectual property]]. Therefore, such information may be gathered from external and / or internal sources. Finally, the information is devoted to be turned into financial models to estimate the fundamental value of a particular type of intellectual property based on such adapted International Valuation Standards.

* [[Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice]] (USPAP)
* [[International Valuation Standards Committee]] (IVSC) (50 Countries)
* [[US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP)
* [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS)
* [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB)

The valuation analysts use numerous approaches in order to reach a reasonable indication of a defined value for the subject intangible assets on a certain date which is referred to as the valuation date. The most common approaches to estimate the fundamental or fair value of the intellectual property are defined as the following:
 
1. '''Cost approach:''' The [[cost]] approach is based on the economic principle of [[substitution (economics)|substitution]].  This principle states that an [[investor]] will pay no more for an asset than the cost to obtain, by [[purchasing]] or constructing, a substitute asset of equal utility. There are several cost approach valuation methods, the most common being the historical cost, replacement cost, and replication cost.

2.''' Market approach:''' The [[Market (economics)|market]] approach is based on the [[economic]] principle of [[competition]] and [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. These principles conclude that, in a free and unrestricted [[Market (economics)|market]], [[supply and demand]] factors will drive the [[price]] of an asset at equilibrium point. Furthermore, it provides an indication of the value by comparing the price at which similar property has exchanged between willing buyers and sellers. Data on such similar transactions may be accessed in several public sources, including specialized royalty rate databases.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

3. '''Income approach:''' This approach estimates the fair value of intellectual property by discounting the future economic benefits of ownership at an appropriate discount rate.

4. '''Direct approach:''' The direct approach is based on the current value of shares of [[intellectual property]] in an Intellectual Property (IP) Share Market.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/27084/title/Time-for-an-IP-Share-Market-/ 'Lyons-Weiler, J. 2009.', '''The Scientist'''], ''Time for an IP Share Market?''.&lt;/ref&gt;

5. Using the pay-off method on top of the four above mentioned methods is a way to enhance the valuation and analysis of intellectual property &lt;ref&gt;[http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/12687/1/JIPR%2016%285%29%20377-384.pdf Collan, M. and Heikkilä, M., 2011, Enhancing Patent Valuation with the Pay-Off Method, Journal of Intellectual Property Rights, 16, 5, 377-384]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10405">'''Involuntary unemployment''' occurs when a person is willing to work at the prevailing wage yet is [[unemployed]]. Involuntary unemployment is distinguished from voluntary unemployment, where workers choose not to work because their [[reservation wage]] is higher than the prevailing wage. In an economy with involuntary unemployment there is a surplus of labor at the current real wage. Involuntary unemployment cannot be represented with a basic [[supply and demand]] model at a competitive equilibrium: All workers on the labor supply curve above the market wage would voluntarily choose not to work, and all those below the market wage would be employed. Given the basic supply and demand model, involuntarily unemployed workers lie somewhere off of the labor supply curve.{{sfn|Taylor|2008}} Economists have several theories explaining the possibility of involuntary unemployment including [[implicit contract theory]], [[Disequilibrium macroeconomics|disequilibrium theory]], staggered wage setting, and [[efficiency wages]].{{sfn|Taylor|2008}}

==Explanations==
[[File:Efficiency wage Shapiro Stiglitz.svg|right|thumb|alt=Chart showing the relationship of the non-shirking condition and full employment.|In the Shapiro-Stiglitz model workers are paid at a level where they do not shirk. This prevents wages from dropping to market clearing levels. Full employment cannot be achieved because workers would slack off if they were not threatened with the possibility of unemployment. The curve for the no-shirking condition (labeled NSC) goes to infinity at full employment.]]
Models based on implicit contract theory, like that of Azariadis (1975), are based on the hypothesis that labor contracts make it difficult for employers to cut wages. Employers often resort to layoffs rather than implement wage reductions. Azariadis showed that given risk-averse workers and risk-neutral employers, contracts with the possibility of layoff would be the optimal outcome.{{sfn|De Vroey|2002|p=384}}

Efficiency wage models suggest that employers pay their workers above market clearing wages in order to enhance their productivity.{{sfn|Taylor|2008}} In efficiency wage models based on shirking, employers are worried that workers may shirk knowing that they can simply move to another job if they are caught. Employers make shirking costly by paying workers more than the wages they would receive elsewhere. This gives workers an incentive not to shirk.{{sfn|Taylor|2008}} When all firms behave this way, an equilibrium is reached where there are unemployed workers willing to work at prevailing wages.{{sfn|Shapiro|Stiglitz|1984}}

[[File:Malinvaud unemployment typology.svg|thumb|right|Chart representing Malinvaud's typology includes a region with Keynesian unemployment, where there is an excess supply of goods and labor, and a region of classical unemployment, where there is an excess supply of labor and excess demand for goods.{{sfn|Tsoulfidis|2010|p=294}}]]
Following earlier disequilibrium research including that of [[Robert Barro]] and [[Herschel Grossman]], work by [[Edmond Malinvaud]] clarified the distinction between classical unemployment, where real wages are too high for markets to clear, and Keynesian unemployment, involuntary unemployment due to inadequate aggregate demand.{{sfn|Taylor|2008}}  In Malinvaud's model, classical unemployment is remedied by cutting the real wage while Keynesian unemployment requires an exogenous stimulus in demand.{{sfn|De Vroey|2002|p=383}} Unlike implicit contrary theory and efficiency wages, this line of research does not rely on a higher than market-clearing wage level.  This type of involuntary unemployment is consistent with Keynes's definition while efficiency wages and implicit contract theory do not fit well with Keynes's focus on demand deficiency.{{sfn|De Vroey|2002|p=383-385}}

==Perspectives==
{{See also|Shapiro–Stiglitz theory}}
For many economists, involuntary unemployment is a real-world phenomenon of central importance to economics. Many economic theories have been motivated by the desire to understand and control involuntary unemployment.{{sfn|McCombie|1987|p=203}} However, acceptance of the concept of involuntary unemployment isn't universal among economists.{{who|date=June 2018}} Some do not accept it as a real or coherent aspect of economic theory. {{who|date=June 2018}}

Shapiro and Stiglitz, developers of an influential shirking model, stated "To us, involuntary unemployment is a real and important phenomenon with grave social consequences that needs to be explained and understood."{{sfn|Shapiro|Stiglitz|1985|p=1217}}

[[Mancur Olson]] argued that real world events like the [[Great Depression]] could not be understood without the concept of involuntary unemployment. He argued against economists who denied involuntary unemployment and put their theories ahead of "common sense and the observations and experiences of literally hundreds of millions of people... that there is also involuntary unemployment and that it is by no means an isolated or rare phenomenon".{{sfn|Olson|1982|p=195}}

Other economists do not believe that true involuntary unemployment exists{{sfn|Mayer|1997|p=94}} or question its relevance to economic theory. [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]] claims "...there is an involuntary element in all unemployment in the sense that no one chooses bad luck over good; there is also a voluntary element in all unemployment, in the sense that, however miserable one's current work options, one can always choose to accept them"{{sfn|Lucas|1978|p=354}} and "the unemployed worker at any time can always find some job at once".{{sfn|Lucas|1978|p=354}} Lucas dismissed the need for theorists to explain involuntary unemployment since it is "not a fact or a phenomenon which it is the task of theorists to explain. It is, on the contrary, a theoretical construct which Keynes introduced in the hope it would be helpful in discovering a correct explanation for a genuine phenomenon: large-scale ﬂuctuations in measured, total unemployment."{{sfn|Lucas|1978|p=354-355}} Along those lines [[real business cycle]] and other models from Lucas's [[new classical school]] explain fluctuations in employment by shifts in labor supply driven by changes in workers' productivity and preferences for leisure.{{sfn|Taylor|2008}}

Involuntary unemployment is also conceptually problematic with [[Matching theory (economics)|search and matching theories]] of unemployment. In these models, unemployment is voluntary in the sense that a worker might choose to endure unemployment during a long search for a higher paying job than those immediately available; however, there is an involuntary element in the sense that a worker does not have control of the economic circumstances that force them to look for new work in the first place.{{sfn|Andolfatto|2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15824">A '''letter of recommendation''' or '''recommendation letter''', also known as a '''letter of reference''', '''reference letter''' or simply '''reference''', is a document in which the writer assesses the qualities, characteristics, and capabilities of the person being recommended in terms of that individual's ability to perform a particular task or function. Letters of recommendation are typically related to [[employment]] (such a letter may also be called an '''employment reference''' or '''job reference'''), [[University and college admission|admission to institutions of higher education]], or [[scholarship]] eligibility. Recommendation letters are usually specifically requested to be written about someone, and are therefore addressed to a particular requester (such as a new employer, university admissions officer, etc.), although they may also be issued to the person being recommended without specifying an addressee.

References may also be required of companies seeking to win contracts, particularly in the fields of engineering, consultancy, industry and construction, and with regard to [[public procurement]] and [[tender offer|tenders]]. Reference letters for organizations are used to assess its ability to deliver the required level of service.

Some applications, such as professional schools give applicants the choice to waive their right to view their letters or not. Usually, applicants are encouraged to waive their rights because if they do not, it is a sign they are not confident in their recommenders.

== Referee ==

The person providing a reference is called a '''referee'''. An employment reference letter is usually written by a former employer or manager, but references can also be requested from co-workers, customers and vendors.&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=Alison|title=References for employment|url=http://jobsearch.about.com/od/referencesrecommendations/a/referencetips.htm|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers and professors often supply references for students who have taken their classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requesting Letters of Recommendation|url=http://web.csulb.edu/~psy301/lettersrec.html|website=PSY 301|publisher=California State University Long Beach|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reference letters for organizations are usually supplied by parties to which the company has provided similar services in the past. 

== Content ==
The employment reference letter can cover topics such as:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Häusermann: ''Arbeitszeugnisse – wahr, klar und fair. Tipps und Anregungen für verantwortungsbewusste Arbeitgeber''. 6. Auflage. Spektramedia, Zürich 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-908244-08-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the employee's tasks and responsibilities
* the duration of employment or tasks/ responsibilities
* the position relative to the author of the reference letter
* the employee's abilities, knowledge, creativity, intelligence
* the employee's qualifications (foreign languages, special skills)
* the employee's social attitude
* the employee's power of rapport
* reason(s) of employment termination
* some text with the actual recommendation itself (e.g. 'I unequivocally recommend ... [name] as a ... [function/ role] and would be happy to hire him/ her again').

== Language ==
In some countries, elements of performance are evaluated using established forms of expression, sometimes [[euphemism|euphemistic]]. For example, in the German-language ''Arbeitszeugnis'', the following terms are frequently used:&lt;ref&gt;Günter Huber, Waltraud Müller: ''Das Arbeitszeugnis in Recht und Praxis. Rechtliche Grundlagen, Musterzeugnisse, Textbausteine, Zeugnisanalyse''. 12. Auflage. Haufe, Freiburg/Breisgau, Berlin, Planegg bei München, Würzburg 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-448-09322-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excellent = ''stets zu unserer vollsten Zufriedenheit erledigt'' (always done to our complete satisfaction)
* Good = ''stets zu unserer vollen Zufriedenheit'' (always to our full satisfaction)
* Satisfactory = ''zu unserer vollen Zufriedenheit'' (to our full satisfaction)
* Adequate = ''zu unserer Zufriedenheit'' (to our satisfaction)
* Poor = ''hat sich bemüht, den Anforderungen gerecht zu werden'' (has endeavored to meet the demands)

This language established itself as an unwritten code in the employment world. Its purpose was to give even weakly performing employees a letter of recommendation that does not sound negative. However, the euphemistically glazed-over descriptions are now codified and generally known, so that the original cryptic intent is no longer served. &lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Knobbe, Mario Leis, Karsten Umnuß: ''Arbeitszeugnisse: Textbausteine und Tätigkeitsbeschreibungen'' (dt./engl.). 5. Auflage. Haufe, Freiburg/Breisgau, Berlin, Planegg bei München, Würzburg 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-448-10118-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it is still standard to use this codified language.

== Checking of references ==
Most potential employers will contact referees to obtain references before offering a job to a new employee.  A  survey by the [[Society for Human Resource Management]] (SHRM) found that eight out of ten resource professionals said they regularly conduct reference checks for professional (89%), executive (85%), administrative (84%) and technical (81%) positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=Alison|title=References - Will They or Won't They?|url=http://jobsearch.about.com/od/gettingreferences/a/references.htm|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates are advised to ensure that they provide a suitable list of referees to their new prospective employer or institution, and to contact those referees to ensure that they are able and willing to provide a suitable reference. In some cases employers will contact a candidate's former company for a reference even if no contact is supplied by the candidate.

==Duty to provide a reference==

Some employers may not be willing to provide reference letters because they may be worried about potential lawsuits. In this case, the employer may only provide the job title, dates of employment and salary history for the employee.&lt;ref name=Doyle/&gt; Finland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyosuojelu.fi/web/en/employment-relationship/certificate-of-employment|title=Certificate of employment|last=|first=|date=|website=Website of Occupational Safety and Health Administration in Finland|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Hungary]]&lt;ref&gt;See [http://njt.hu/cgi_bin/njt_doc.cgi?docid=143164.348578 Section 81 of the Labour Code]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bulgaria]] are the only countries in [[Europe]] where employees can legally claim an employment reference, including the right to a correct, unambiguous and benevolent appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz-Günther Dachrodt, Erich Ullmann: ''Zeugnisse lesen und verstehen. Formulierungen und ihre Bedeutung''. [[Österreichischer Gewerkschaftsbund|ÖGB]]-Verlag Wien 2000, {{ISBN|3-7035-0809-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is no [[common law]] duty to provide a reference,&lt;ref&gt;''Lawton v BOC Transhield Ltd'', [1987] 2 All ER 608&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has held that a refusal to do so may constitute "conduct that is [[Injustice|unfair]] or is in [[bad faith]]" with respect to a [[wrongful dismissal]], and thus "indicative of the type of conduct that ought to merit compensation by way of an addition to the [[notice period]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Wallace v United Grain Growers Ltd|link=Wallace v United Grain Growers Ltd|year=1997|court=scc|num=332|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 96-101|parallelcite=[1997] 3 SCR 701|date=1997-10-30|courtname=auto|juris=}}, subsequently affirmed in {{cite CanLII|litigants=Honda Canada Inc v Keays|link=Honda Canada Inc v Keays|year=2008|court=scc|num=39|pinpoint=par. 57|parallelcite=[2008] 2 SCR 362|date=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[duty of care]] to ensure that, where one is provided, it is accurate and fair and not give a misleading impression,&lt;ref name="Eversheds2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eversheds.com/global/en/what/articles/index.page?ArticleID=en/Employment_and_labour_law/Regulatory_references_are_you_ready|title= Regulatory references: are you ready?|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 28 January 2016|website= |publisher= [[Eversheds]]|access-date= 13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as held by the [[House of Lords]] in ''[[Spring v Guardian Assurance plc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Spring v Guardian Assurance plc|link=Spring v Guardian Assurance plc|court=UKHL|year=1994|num=7|parallelcite=[1995] 2 AC 296|date=7 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an employer goes beyond what a reference should contain, or if it gives inaccurate or misleading information, liability may arise in the areas of [[breach of statutory duty]], [[negligent misstatement]], [[Tort of deceit|deceit]], [[defamation]] or [[malicious falsehood]].&lt;ref name="Eversheds2016"/&gt; It does not matter what form the reference might take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Byrnell v British Telecommunications &amp; Anor |link=|court=EWHC|division=QB|year=2009|num=727|para=29, 32|parallelcite=|date=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, references received by an employer from another person or organization can be disclosed to the person about whom they are written under the subject access provisions of the [[Data Protection Act 1998]], but certain confidentiality considerations apply as to the identity of the person giving the reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2775/references_v1_final.pdf|title= Data Protection Good Practice Note: Subject access and employment references |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 16 November 2005|website= |publisher= [[Information Commissioner's Office]]|access-date= 14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, together with the duty of care under ''Spring'', many organizations have issued guidance as to [[best practice]] to be undertaken by reference providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.stir.ac.uk/media/services/registry/planning/legalcompliance/ReferencesAdvisoryNote.pdf|title= Data Classification: Issuing of Staff and Student References Advisory Note|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= January 2015|website= stir.ac.uk|publisher= [[University of Stirling]]|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sath.nhs.uk/Library/Documents/HR/Policies/HR70%20Employment%20References%20v1.pdf|title= Human Resources Policy No. HR70: Employment References|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= December 2010|website= sath.nhs.uk|publisher= [[Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust]]|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duty of care has also been held to apply in non-reference situations, as noted in 2011 in '' McKie v Swindon College''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Salter|first= Michael|last2= Bryden|first2= Chris|date= 24 June 2011|title= Gone but not forgotten|url= http://www.newlawjournal.co.uk/nlj/content/gone-not-forgotten|journal= [[New Law Journal]]|publisher= |volume= 161|issue= 7471|pages= |doi= }}, discussing {{cite BAILII|litigants=McKie v Swindon College|link=|court=EWHC|division=QB|year=2011|num=469|parallelcite=|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] has held that "a reference must not give an unfair or misleading impression overall, even if its discrete components are factually correct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Bartholomew v London Borough Of Hackney &amp; Anor |link=|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1998|num=1604|parallelcite=|date=23 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while a reference must be accurate and fair, it is not necessary to report all material facts concerning an individual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Cox v Sun Alliance Life Ltd|link=|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2001|num=649|parallelcite=|date=9 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can be argued that, if an agreed reference arising from a [[settlement agreement]] is misleadingly incomplete, the employer can be sued by a subsequent employer for breaching its duty of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Smith|first1= Ian|last2= Baker|first2= Aaron|date= 2015|title= Smith &amp; Wood's Employment Law|edition=12th|url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=rpFcCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=jvZ2eKiOVY&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|page= 163|isbn=978-0-19-872735-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]], in an [[unfair dismissal]] case, ruled that, in preparing a reference, it was not reasonable to provide details of complaints against an employee of which the employee was not aware.&lt;ref&gt;''TSB Bank Plc v Harris'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKEAT/1999/1145_97_0112.html &amp;#91;1999&amp;#93; UKEAT 1145_97_0112] (1 December 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal has further held that, if an employee leaves when an investigation is ongoing but has not been concluded, or where issues arise after an employee leaves that have not been investigated, employers can disclose this information but should do so in a measured and fair way, which will be particularly important if to omit this information would mean providing a misleading reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Jackson v Liverpool City Council |link=|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2011|num=1068|parallelcite=|date=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] and the [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]] are issuing rules that will require the furnishing of references, before any approval or certification may be given by them, as well as specifying the information that they must contain.&lt;ref name="Eversheds2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fca.org.uk/news/cp15-31-regulatory-references|title= CP15/31: Strengthening accountability in banking and insurance: regulatory references|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 6 October 2015|website= |publisher= [[Financial Conduct Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Pages/publications/cp/2015/cp3615.aspx#|title= Strengthening accountability in banking and insurance: regulatory references - CP36/15|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 6 October 2015|website= |publisher= [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Modern===

District 14 consists of all or part of the neighborhoods of the [[Downtown Los Angeles|Downtown]], [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles|Boyle Heights]], [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]], [[El Sereno, Los Angeles|El Sereno]], [[Garvanza, Los Angeles|Garvanza]], [[Glassell Park, Los Angeles|Glassell Park]], [[Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles|Lincoln Heights]], and [[Monterey Hills, Los Angeles|Monterey Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cd14.lacity.org/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The Boyle Heights and Northeast sections are connected by a narrow strip of land.  Huizar maintains field offices in Downtown, Boyle Heights, El Sereno and Eagle Rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cd14.lacity.org/YOUR_TEAM/District_Profile/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313145833/http://cd14.lacity.org/YOUR_TEAM/District_Profile/index.htm |archivedate=2010-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic===

A new [[city charter]] effective in 1925 replaced the former "[[Plurality-at-large voting|at large" voting system]] for a nine-member council with a [[Single member constituency|district system]] with a 15-member council. Each district was to be approximately equal in population, based upon the voting in the previous gubernatorial election; thus redistricting was done every four years. (At present, redistricting is done every ten years, based upon the preceding U.S. census results.)&lt;ref name=ShiftToValley&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/12/local/me-council12 Tina  Daunt and Seema Mehta, "Council Districts Drawn to Benefit Valley, Latinos," ''Los Angeles Times,'' June 12, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The numbering system established in 1925 for City Council districts began with No. 1 in the north of the city, the [[San Fernando Valley]], and ended with No. 15 in the south, the [[Port of Los Angeles|Harbor area]].

District 14 has always represented Eagle Rock and Highland Park. As the city's population increased, it has expanded southward. The rough boundaries or descriptions of the district have been as follows:

'''1925''' The communities of [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]], [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]] and [[Annandale (Pacific Electric)|Annandale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=394260481&amp;sid=17&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "First Map Showing City's Council Districts," ''Los Angeles Times,'' January 16, 1925, page A-1] Includes a map.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1928''' Westward extension to Allesandro Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=367533262&amp;sid=18&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Council Areas' Lines Changed," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 29, 1928, page A-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1932–33:'''  East boundary: [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. North: [[Glendale, California|Glendale]]. West: [[Glendale Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=388506821&amp;sid=18&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "District Lines Get Approval," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 24, 1932, page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1935''' Same general area as 1932, with the western boundary at [[Griffith Park]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=392763061&amp;sid=16&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Do You Know Who Your City Councilman Is?" ''Los Angeles Times,'' March 24, 1935, page 22] Includes a map.&lt;/ref&gt; thus including the [[Atwater Village, Los Angeles|Atwater]] area.

'''1940''' Same general area as previously, with the west boundary at [[Glendale Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=410578151&amp;sid=5&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Proposed New Alignment for  City Voting Precincts," ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 30, 1940, page A-3] Includes a map.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1955:''' [[Rose Hill Park, Los Angeles|Rose Hill]] [sic] is now included in the district's description.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=435436872&amp;sid=41&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Unusual Setup for Council's Contests," ''Los Angeles Times,'' April 3, 1955, page B-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1971''' "The district begins in the [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] Mexican-American [[barrio]]s of [[El Sereno, Los Angeles|El Sereno]] and [[Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles|Lincoln Heights]] extends westward across the [[Pasadena Freeway]] to [[Anglo-American ethnic group|Anglo]] middle-class homes in [[Glassell Park]], [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]], [[Hermon, Los Angeles|Hermon]], and [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] through [[Griffith Park]]. Around the western edge of the district is the [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz District]], with some of the city's more expensive homes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=644458222&amp;sid=11&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP Bill Boyarsky, "Snyder Expected to Win Easily," ''Los Angeles Times,'' March 25, 1971, page C-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1986''' No longer includes Los Feliz. Southern reach includes [[El Sereno, Los Angeles|El Sereno]], College Avenue, [[Huntington Drive]] and portions of Alhambra Avenue and [[Valley Boulevard]], then across the  [[San Bernardino Freeway]] to [[Cesar Chavez Avenue|Brooklyn Avenue]], East [[Beverly Boulevard]], Fourth Street and [[Whittier Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1085633952&amp;sid=10&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Los Angeles' Realigned Council Districts," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 21, 1986] Includes a map.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark Phooi Peck Lye''' (born 22 August 1962) is a Singaporean entrepreneur in the design industry. He is the founder and CEO of First Media Pte Ltd (FM), a holding company that manages a collection of design agencies and design institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstmedia.com.sg Objective of First Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103022034/http://www.firstmedia.com.sg/ |date=3 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first business venture at the age of 27 was a design agency he started on his own with a capital of S$2,000. He called it Lancer Design,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Swati |last=Chaudhary |title=First Media eyes more M&amp;As |location = Singapore |work=The Business Times |date=18 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deriving the name Lancer from the word "freelancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rossara |last=Jamil |title=Visionary By Design |location = Singapore |work=Marketing Magazine |date= September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 32, he earned his first million.

In 2006, Phooi founded First Media Design School (FMDS), a progressive private educational institution specialising in the field of design. In August 2011, FMDS was awarded the Council for Private Education's (CPE) four-year EduTrust mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kelly |last=Tan |title=Surviving the school of hard knocks |location = Singapore |work=The Business Times |date=1 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Phooi was born in Singapore. His father worked as a contractor for [[PSA International]] and his mother was a contract labourer. At the age of 9, he joined [[The Singapore Scout Association]](SSA) as a Sea Scout and at the age of 12, he became a qualified lifeguard.

Phooi attended his secondary school education from the age of 13 to 16 at [[Tanglin Secondary School]]. At the age of 24, he enrolled into a Fine Arts diploma program at the [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]](NAFA), but switched to a Graphic Design pathway soon after. He graduated from NAFA in 1989 at the age of 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rossara |last=Jamil |title=Visionary By Design |location = Singapore |work=Marketing Magazine |date= September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he graduated from the [[University of New South Wales]] with a Master of Design.

==Career==

===Lifeguard and swimming coach===
While waiting to be enlisted into the National Service, Phooi worked for a year as a lifeguard at Big Splash, a water theme park in Singapore that was launched in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyplaces.com/singapore/singapore_attraction.html Fun Days Out] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126133012/http://www.everyplaces.com/singapore/singapore_attraction.html |date=26 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he also taught swimming to a handful of students, aged between 6 and 10 years old, on a part-time basis.

While serving his term with the [[Singapore Armed Forces]], Phooi continued to coach swimming during his weekends to supplement his income. After his National Service term was completed, he started to teach on a full-time basis, only retiring from coaching at the age of 29.

Midway through his coaching career, Phooi embarked on a training program to attain the CLASS 1 Swimming Coach qualification. As part this program, he was attached to the [[People's Association]] swimming team, under the tutelage of the late Kee Soon Bee, a prolific national swimming coach. Kee was well known for being able to spot and groom
competitive national swimmers such as [[Junie Sng]], [[Mark Chay]] and [[Joscelin Yeo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsmuseum.com.sg/heroes/roll_of_honour/coach/kee_soon_bee.html KEE SOON BEE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226061611/http://www.sportsmuseum.com.sg/heroes/roll_of_honour/coach/kee_soon_bee.html |date=26 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designpreneur===
Phooi began his career as a designpreneur (entrepreneur in the design industry) by setting up Lancer Design in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cover Story: Mark Phooi |location = Singapore |work=The Executive |date=June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its early years, he was running the company as a one-man show, which meant that he had to adopt all the required roles to sustain his company, such as being the salesman, project coordinator, creative head, planner and administrator.

In 2002, Mark established First Media Pte Ltd (FM) as a holding company for his design firms and design schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Enterprise 50 Awards 2005 |location = Singapore |work=The Straits Times |date=24 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His design agencies specialised in various design and media disciplines, such as corporate design, interactive media, events, publishing and advertising and promotion. Companies under the First Media brand include Lancer Design and Mint Editions in Singapore, Brand Smart in China, Auromedia, Discover Jakarta and Imago in Indonesia, BnBc Advertising Sdn Bhd and BnBc Events and Promotions Sdn Bhd in Malaysia, Clever Brand Strategy Co. Ltd in Taiwan, and P.0.P. House in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstmedia.com.sg First Media Companies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103022034/http://www.firstmedia.com.sg/ |date=3 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, FM was one of only five recipients to receive the Enterprise 50 Award – an annual business award recognising Singapore's most promising privately held companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Swati |last=Chaudhary |title=First Media eyes more M&amp;As |location = Singapore |work=The Business Times |date=18 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Mark was awarded one of the Top Entrepreneurs of the Year Awards (organised by the
Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) and the Rotary Club of Singapore) – one of the highest business award recognitions in Singapore, and one that no trained designer had ever attained previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cover Story: Mark Phooi |location = Singapore |work=The Executive |date=June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Mark was also selected as one of the finalists in Singapore's top design accolade – the President's Design Award.

===Principal===
In 2006, Mark founded First Media Design School (FMDS), a boutique private design institution that offers diploma, advanced diploma and degree programs in the areas [[Graphic design]], [[Multimedia]] and Fashion design. Its [[Bachelor's degree]] program is conferred by the [[University of the West of England]](UWE).

The institution's mission statement specifies that FMDS strives to cultivate a new generation of 'whole brain' trained, industry-ready designers who possess both creative and commercial cognitive abilities, through its holistic design thinking and design management teaching system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstmedia.edu.sg/aboutus/visionmission.html Vision &amp; Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303042613/http://www.firstmedia.edu.sg/aboutus/visionmission.html |date=3 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its teaching methodology is partly derived from the [[Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument]] system.

The students enrolled in FMDS consist of a mixture of local and international students, mostly from Indonesia and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=U-wen |last=Lee |title=Designing a career |location = Singapore |work=Today |date=11 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FMDS equips career starters and career switchers with the necessary skills to go from mere practitioner to business-owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=U-wen |last=Lee |title=Designing a career |location = Singapore |work=Today |date=11 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in 2006, when Mark was asked about how he envisions FMDS to be different from other design schools in Singapore, he said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Swati |last=Chaudhary |title=First Media eyes more M&amp;As |location = Singapore |work=The Business Times |date=18 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We will differentiate ourselves by developing designers to become design managers. This is what is lacking in the industry today. There are many designers but not enough creative managers. We have thousands of graduates every year with few job opportunities. Not only will we create enterprising graduates, but we will also offer them jobs in our companies.}}

==Books==
In 2013, Mark co-authored ''[[Think like a Sage, Work like a Fool, Act like a Criminal]]'' ({{ISBN|978-981-07-5167-8}}), which consists of his biography, and a compilation of business theories, life lessons and personal reflections garnered from the early years of his career as a designpreneur to the present.

[[File:Moshe-podhorzer.jpg|alt=Moshe Podhortzer|thumb|Moshe Podhorzer]]
'''Moshe Podhorzer''' was born 1945 in Israel. He is an entrepreneur, industrialist and a businessman.
Moshe was the  CEO of Tempo Beverages, founded and owned  "Neviot"(mineral water) and is very involved in real estate in the United States and Europe.

== Biography ==
Moshe was born in Israel. He is the son of Sarah and the attorney Yehuda Aryeh Podhorzer.

Moshe is married to Bilha, the daughter of industrialist Moshe Bornstein the founder and owner of Tempo.

After his military service, he studied Economics and Business administration at [[Bar-Ilan University]] and

at the same time studied law at the [[Tel Aviv University|University of Tel Aviv]] and received his law degree 1972.

Toward the end of his studies and upon obtaining his lawyer's license, Moshe joined "Tempo" Industries Ltd. and served as the company's CEO for nearly 20 years until the early 90's.

At "[[Tempo Beer Industries|Tempo]]" Podhorzer led a number of strategic and innovative moves that significantly affected the company and the Israeli food and beverage market in general.

Tempo, under Moshe's management, was the first to introduce to the Israeli market the PET bottled soft drinks instead of the glass bottles that were customary at the time by all soft drink companies.

In addition, during this period Tempo became "[[Tempo Beer Industries|Tempo Beer Industries Ltd]]" after acquisition of the only beer company in Israel.

Also during those years, Tempo began producing and marketing Pepsi Cola, which brought about an "earthquake" in the beverage market in Israel. Tempo was chosen by the Dutch company "Heineken" and became Heineken's representative in Israel.

In '''1989''' - Moshe initiated, established, and privately owned the "Neviot" company (mineral water), which within a short time managed to hold 50% of the market shares in Israel. After only three years from its establishment, in 1992, it was issued on the Israeli Stock Exchange. Since then, "Neviot" has gained an excellent reputation and is a leading brand, all this due to Moshe's reputation and proven management and marketing skills in the food and beverages industry.

In '''2000''' – Moshe added the "Coca-Cola" company as a partner having Coca Cola acquire 40% of Neviot's stock. Moshe continued to serve as the company's Chairman of the Board. Following this agreement, "Coca-Cola" became the distributor for Neviot bottles while "Neviot" distributed its own home water containers.

"In '''2003''' - Moshe sold 45% of Tempo's stock held by him and his wife to other partners in the company.

In '''2005''' – Moshe sold the remaining shares of  Neviot to Coca-Cola and left the soft drink industry. That year, he was awarded the Kiryat Shmona City Notable, along with Shlomo Nehama who was the Chairman of the Board of Hapoalim bank at that time and Eli Horowitz, founder and CEO of Teva.

During those years, he began to engage in the field of real estate development in Spain and Cyprus, where he established projects for the construction of hundreds of resort units. In the United States and Europe, Moshe continues to invest in real estate by  "Podhorzer Holdings Ltd."

Additional investments are made through his other company investment arm, "P.I.M – Podhorzer Investment &amp; Management Ltd. P.I.M examines companies that require a "change of direction" and invests in them.

Moshe Podhorzer serves as a Member of the Executive Committee and Member of the Board of Trustees of Bar-Ilan University.

Podhorzer lives in Tel Aviv and has four children: Eyal, Dana, Yossi and Yonatan.

His son Eyal is the owner of Econergy Systems Ltd., which invests in the solar energy field in Israel and in Europe.

'''Overtime''' is the amount of time someone works beyond ''normal working hours''. The term is also used for the pay received for this time. Normal hours may be determined in several ways:
*by custom (what is considered healthy or reasonable by society),
*by practices of a given trade or profession,
*by legislation,
*by agreement between employers and workers or their representatives.

Most nations have overtime [[labour law]]s designed to dissuade or prevent employers from forcing their employees to work excessively long hours (such as the situation in the textile mills in the 1920s). These laws may take into account other considerations than humanitarian concerns, such as preserving the health of workers so that they may continue to be productive, or increasing the overall level of employment in the economy.  One common approach to regulating overtime is to require employers to pay workers at a higher hourly rate for overtime work. Companies may choose to pay workers higher overtime pay even if not obliged to do so by law, particularly if they believe that they face a [[backward bending supply curve of labour]].

Overtime pay rates can cause workers to work longer hours than they would at a flat hourly rate.  Overtime laws, attitudes toward overtime and [[hours of work]] vary greatly from country to country and between various sectors.

==Time off in lieu==
''Time off in lieu''; ''compensatory time''; or ''comp time'' refers to a type of work schedule arrangement that allows (or requires) workers to take time off instead of, or in addition to, receiving overtime pay. A worker may receive overtime pay plus equal time off for each hour worked on certain agreed days, such as [[public holidays]].

In the United States, such arrangements are currently legal in the public sector but not in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;See 29 U.S.C. 207(o)&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, non-exempt workers must receive at least one and one half times their normal hourly wage for every hour worked beyond 40 hours in a work week. For example, workers who clock 48 hours in one week would receive the pay equivalent to 52 hours of work (40 hours + 8 hours at 1.5 times the normal hourly wage). With comp time, the worker could (or would have to) forgo the 12 hours of overtime pay and instead take 8 paid hours off at some future date.{{clarify|date=March 2012}}{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In some other jurisdictions, such as Canada, employers might be required to pay the overtime at the higher rate (e.g. 1.5 times the normal rate), but also be allowed to require time off in lieu at the '''normal''' rate. Thus, an employee might work 48 hours in one week, and 32 hours the next week (assuming over 40 hours is overtime), and be paid an extra amount equivalent to 4 hours work (8 multiplied by 0.5).

In Australia, such arrangements both in the private and public sector are common.

In some cases, particularly when employees are represented by a [[labour union]], overtime may be paid at a higher rate than 1.5 times the hourly pay. In some factories, for example, if workers are required to work on a Sunday, they may be paid twice their regular rate (i.e., "double time").

==Overtime laws by jurisdiction==

===European Union===
[[Directive (European Union)|Directives]] issued by the [[European Union]] must be incorporated into law by member states.

Directives 93/104/EC (1993), 2000/34/EC (2000), which limited working hours, were consolidated into 2003/88/EC (2003). Employers and employees can agree to opt out, under certain circumstances.

The directives require:&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32003L0088&lt;/ref&gt;
* maximum average working week (including overtime) of 48 hours over a 17-week reference period
* minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours in every 24
* breaks when the working day exceeds 6 hours
* minimum weekly rest period of 24 hours plus the 11 hours daily rest period in every 7-day period
* minimum of 4 weeks paid annual leave
* night work restricted to an average of 8 hours in any 24-hour period

The directives apply to:
*all sectors of activity, both public and private
*Doctors in training used to work a maximum week of 58 hours until 2009. From 1 August 2009 their maximum working week fell to 48 hours.

Exemptions:
* Member States of the EC may exempt: managing executives or other persons with autonomous decision-making power; family workers; and workers officiating at religious ceremonies. These are workers whose working time is not measured or pre-determined or can be determined by the workers.
* Other categories can be exempted from the directive's key provisions provided compensatory rest or appropriate protection is granted. These include employees who work a long way from home, or whose activities require a permanent presence or continuity of service or production, or who work in sectors which have peaks of activity. Examples include off-shore workers, security guards, journalists, emergency workers, agricultural workers, tour guides, etc.

===Japan===

In Japan the {{nihongo|[[Labor Standards Act of 1947|Labour Standards Act]]|労働基準法}}  of 1947 provides for an eight-hour work day and 40-hour workweek with at least one day off per week. The act requires a premium of at least 25% over the ordinary hourly wage for any overtime work, 35% for any work on prescribed off days, and an additional 25% for any work between 10 pm and 5 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=法定労働時間と割増賃金について教えてください。|url=http://www.mhlw.go.jp/bunya/roudoukijun/faq_kijyungyosei07.html|publisher=労働基準局監督課|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers must enter into an overtime agreement with a labour representative prior to any overtime work by employees, and this agreement must stipulate to the maximum number of overtime hours that an employee may work, which may be no more than 15 hours per week, 45 hours per month and 360 hours per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=時間外労働の 限度に関する基準|url=http://www.mhlw.go.jp/new-info/kobetu/roudou/gyousei/kantoku/dl/040324-4.pdf|publisher=厚生労働省・都道府県労働局・労働基準監督署|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Federal overtime law====
In the United States the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938 applies to employees in industries engaged in or producing goods for interstate commerce.  The FLSA establishes a standard [[work week]] of 40 hours for certain kinds of workers, and mandates payment for overtime hours to those workers of one and one-half times the workers' normal rate of pay for any time worked above 40 hours.  

The law creates two broad categories of employees, 
* those who are "exempt" from the regulation and 
* those who are "non-exempt". 

Employers are not required to pay exempt employees overtime but must do so for non-exempt employees. 

=====Exempt=====
[[Independent contractors]] are not considered employees and therefore are not protected by the FLSA.  Several factors determine whether a worker is an employee, who might be entitled to overtime compensation, or an independent contractor, who would not be so entitled. The employment agreement stating that a party is an independent contractor does not make it necessarily so. The nature of a job determines whether an employee is entitled to overtime pay, not employment status or the field of work.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wage and Hour Division Questions and Answers|url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/flsa/faq.htm|website=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes of workers who are exempt from the regulation include 
* certain types of administrative, 
* professional, and 
* executive employees. 

To qualify as an administrative, professional, or executive employee and therefore not be entitled to overtime, three tests must be passed based on salary basis, duties, and salary level. The tests vary between administrative, professional, and executive employees based on their different duties and salary levels. There are many other classes of workers who may be exempt including outside salespeople, certain agricultural employees, certain live-in employees, and certain transportation employees. Employees can neither waive their FLSA protections nor abridge them by contract.

=====USA Protections=====
An employer may not retaliate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/can_my_employer_retaiate_against_me_for_seeking_to_get_overtime|title=Can My Employer Retaliate Against Me for Seeking To Get Overtime? - findUSlaw|author=|date=|website=finduslaw.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; against an employee for filing a complaint or instituting a proceeding based on the FLSA.  An employer that engages in any form of verifiable  retaliation would be liable under the [http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_uscode_chapter_8#16 Fair Labor Standards Act Section 216(b)]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} for equitable relief including reinstatement, promotion, payment of lost wages, and payment of liquidated damages. Acts of retaliation include terminating employment, disrupting the workplace, threats, acts of physical violence, and constructive discharge.

=====USA statistics=====
Out of approximately 120 million American workers, nearly 50 million are exempt from overtime laws (US Department of Labor, [[Wage and Hour Division]], 1998). In 2004, the United States was 7th out of 24 [[OECD]] countries in terms of annual working hours per worker. (See [[Working time]] for a complete listing.) In 2015, the [[United States Department of Labor]] proposed dramatic changes to certain exemptions from federal minimum wage and overtime requirements. These changes are anticipated to take effect in July 2016, but as of January 2016, still are pending final approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ceglowski|first1=Kevin|title=Changes to Minimum Wage and Overtime Exemptions Expected by July 2016|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/changes-to-minimum-wage-and-overtime-exemptions-expected-july-2016|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=The National Law Review|publisher=Poyner Spruill LLP|date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed changes include: setting the minimum salary level required for exemption for full-time salaried workers at $970 per week, or $50,440 annually (an increase  from the current $455 per week, or $23,660 annually) Increasing the total annual compensation required to exempt highly compensated employees to $122,148 annually (from the current $100,000 annually).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huntington|first1=R. Calder|title=New Overtime Rules: $970 Per Week Salary Proposed For White Collar Exemptions in 2016|journal=The [[National Law Review ]]|date=30  June 2015|publisher=Holland &amp; Hart LLP|issn=2161-3362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2004, President [[George W. Bush]] and the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] proposed changes to regulations governing implementation of the law.  According to one study, the changes would have had significant impact on the number of workers covered by overtime laws and have exempted several million additional workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_viewpoints_final_overtime_regulations (Economic Policy Institute)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201210846/http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_viewpoints_final_overtime_regulations |date=December 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush administration maintained that the practical impact on working Americans would be minimal and that the changes would help clarify an outdated regulation. In particular, the new rules would have allowed more companies to offer [[flextime]] to their workers in lieu of overtime. The definition of ''exempt employees'' (ineligible for overtime) is regularly tested in the courts.  A recent case is [[Encino Motorcars v. Navarro]], which addresses the question of whether automobile dealer service advisors are eligible for overtime.

A company may harm themselves by docking a salaried employee for disciplinary reasons.
::"Once pay is reduced using an hourly calculation,  ... the employee is considered nonexempt, and so is every other worker in that job group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=CFO |date=May 2001  |page=16 |title=Whitewashing Blue Collars  |author=Marie Leone}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Uber (company)]] is an example of a company that, in various jurisdictions, has encountered various [[Uber protests and legal actions|legal problems]] regarding exemptions. The New York Times noted in 2017 that "Despite their appeal, the apps have faced a wave of criticism, including concerns over wheelchair accessibility and driver pay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====California overtime law====
The state of [[California]]'s overtime laws differ from federal overtime laws in many respects, and they involve overlapping [[statutes]], [[regulations]], and [[precedents]] that govern the compensation of employees in California.  
* Governing federal law is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8 Fair Labor Standards Act] (29 USC 201-219)
* California overtime law is codified in provisions of:
:*the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111227075026/http://finduslaw.com/california_labor_code California Labor Code] and in
:*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110815204045/http://finduslaw.com/industrial_welfare_commission_wage_orders Wage orders] of the [[Industrial Welfare Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/iwc.html|title=DIR - IWC Home Page|first=|last=DIR|date=|website=www.dir.ca.gov|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
California employers must comply with both, since there are two sources of applicable law (federal and state).

In California, based on [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233012/http://www.finduslaw.com/node/6/#55 California Labor Code 1171], only an [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233012/http://www.finduslaw.com/node/6/#55 employment relationship] is required for overtime rules to apply.  Under the California [http://finduslaw.com/industrial_welfare_commission_wage_orders Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders], an "employer" is "any person ... who directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other person, employs or exercises control over wages, hours, or working conditions of any person." Under the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111227075026/http://finduslaw.com/california_labor_code California Labor Code], an "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233824/http://www.finduslaw.com/node/4/#16 employee]" is "[any] person, including aliens and minors, rendering actual service  in any business for an employer, whether gratuitously or for wages or pay, whether the wages or pay are measured by the standard of time, piece, task, commission, or other method of calculation, and whether the service is rendered on a commission, concessionaire, or other basis."  

=====California: who is covered=====
Independent contractors are not employees covered by overtime laws, so it is important to determine if a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. Under California law, workers are generally presumed to be employees, not Independent contractors. The proper classification of individuals as Independent contractors must, therefore, pass one or more of the various multi-part tests for determining eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scalaw.com/independent-contractors/|title=Independent Contractors|author=|date=|website=scalaw.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foremost, pursuant to California Labor Code Section 510, non-exempt employees must be compensated at one and a half times the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in a workday, 40 hours in a workweek and the first eight hours of a seventh consecutive workday. Employees in California are entitled to double-time for working more than twelve hour workdays or more than eight hours on the seventh consecutive workday of a single workweek.  Under federal law there are only 40 hour weekly overtime limits. This eight hour overtime limit in California frequently gives rise to wage-and-hour litigation for violations of state, but not federal, labour laws.

For example, "comp time" schemes, where employers tell employees that since they worked 10 hours on Monday they can work 6 hours on Tuesday, are illegal because even though the employees are not working more than 40 hours for the purposes of overtime compensation under federal law, they are working more than 8 hours for purposes of California overtime law and rounding the 6- and 10-hour workdays to two 8-hour workdays would cheat the employee out of two hours of overtime pay.

Perhaps the biggest difference between California and federal overtime law relates to the [http://www.dir.ca.gov/glossary.asp?letter=A administrative exemption's] "primarily engaged" in duties that meet the test for the exemption requirement, such as duties that involve exercising independent discretion and judgment as set forth in the controversial [https://web.archive.org/web/20110629143550/http://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/WageOrders2006/iwcarticle4.htmlWage Order No. 4]. Whereas under the Fair Labor Standards Act "primarily engaged" does not necessarily mean at least half, under California wage-and-hour laws, less than half of exempt duties automatically eliminates the overtime exemption.

California's Labor Code Section 510 was amended and Section 511.5 added in 2016 pursuant to the California Workplace Flexibility Act of 2016. Pursuant to these changes, non-exempt workers have additional options to agree to work beyond eight hours in a workday without triggering an overtime pay obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scalaw.com/overtime-pay/|title=Overtime Pay|author=|date=|website=scalaw.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== 1949 ===
''Founding''
: WIA was founded in 1949. The focus of the group has shifted as technologies have advanced. At various times throughout WIA's history, it has focused on land mobile radio, paging, messaging, personal communications services, and tower and antenna siting.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pcia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=10|title = PCIA's Frequency Coordination Services - Leading the Industry|accessdate = 5 May 2014|website = PCIA - The Wireless Infrastructure Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 ===
''Supreme Court''
: In 2012, WIA submitted an amicus curiae brief in the U.S. Supreme Court case Arlington v. FCC. WIA argued in support of the FCC in the case, arguing that local delays in approval of broadband projects are a national problem. The amicus curiae brief cited evidence that over 3,300 wireless service facility siting applications were pending before local jurisdictions throughout the country, and that around 180 of those applications had been pending for over three years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Collocation law''
: In 2012, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act. The law included a provision related to the wireless infrastructure industry. Specifically, section 6409(a) of the law orders states and local governments to approve requests made by companies to collocate{{efn|Collocation is simply the act of placing something next to something else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collocate|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collocate|work=Online dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} , remove or replace transmission equipment on existing wireless towers or base stations.

=== 2013 ===
''FCC and broadband deployment''
: In 2013, WIA submitted comments to the FCC that expressed support in speeding up broadband deployment. WIA helped Congress write legislation that funded broadband deployment. WIA had asked Congress to include infrastructure providers in the list of eligible recipients of federal broadband funding. WIA influenced members of the congressional committees that funded the $4.7 billion Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) to make eligible wireless carriers, backhaul providers, and tower companies for funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stimulus: The Importance of Wireless Infrastructure to Ubiquitous Broadband|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=On9kUdZ4WhwC|publisher=Information Gatekeepers Inc|id=GGKEY:F6ZAYBUPZ2F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Warriors 4 Wireless''
: In 2013, Cisco, American Tower, Dynis, and WIA created a program called Warriors 4 Wireless. The organization helps military veterans train and apply for jobs at wireless companies. The program's stated goal is to place 5,000 veterans in jobs by 2015.

One of the main issues facing the wireless infrastructure industry is related to '''federal vs. local oversight''' of wireless infrastructure activity.

===Federal vs. local oversight===
In a February 2014 article in ''[[National Law Review]]'', Washington telecommunications attorneys Dave Thomas and Douglas A. Svor explained the issue and the battle played out between the wireless industry and local governments.

In their article, Thomas and Svor state that spectrum and infrastructure serve as the most important aspects of federal communications laws in terms of being good for the economy and American competitiveness. For decades, the FCC has worked to make sure that critical communications infrastructure can get built with as little hassle as possible.

In April 2014, the FCC proposed to simplify the regulatory review process for wireless facilities. These facilities include DAS and small cells (see Small cells and HetNet Forum below for more information).

Small cells are built smaller than traditional cells that are typically fixed to larege wireless antenna towers. Infrastructure companies attach small cells to utility poles, street light poles, and even traffic lights. The wireless industry has supported the FCC's work in the areas mentioned above, while local governments have typically been opposed.

WIA asked the FCC to use declaratory rulings to reduce barriers that make it difficult for companies to build wireless infrastructure. For example, if a telecommunications company installs equipment on a structure or tower, WIA believes that other companies should be able to also install their equipment on that same structure or tower. WIA wants the FCC to declare that it would be discriminatory for a tower operator to not allow other companies to install their equipment on the structure or tower, in the example just mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Removing Barriers to Wireless Infrastructure Deployment|url=http://www.pcia.com/images/Advocacy_Docs/tac_barriers_to_deployment_presentation.pdf|work=Presentation to the Federal Communications Commission Technical Advisory Committee|publisher=PCIA – The Wireless Infrastructure Association|accessdate=13 May 2014|format=PDF|date=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In 2014, Senator [[Al Franken]] criticized the "revolving door" hiring placement of former FCC commissioners. Specifically, Franken criticized the hiring of FCC Commissioner Meredith Baker by Comcast. Franken did not mention WIA in his remarks, but an OpenSecrets.org article covering the remarks mentioned the hiring of former Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein by WIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Comcast-FCC Revolving Door|date = 18 April 2014|url = http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2014/04/the-comcast-fcc-revolving-door.html|last = Feinberg|first = Robbie|work = OpenSecrets.org|publisher = Center for Responsive Politics|accessdate = 5 May 2014|location = Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47807">'''Psychological trauma''' is a type of damage to the [[mind]] that occurs as a result of a distressing event. Trauma is often the result of an overwhelming amount of [[stress (psychological)|stress]] that exceeds one's ability to cope, or integrate the [[emotion]]s involved with that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|title=Trauma Definition|work=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805161505/http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|archivedate=August 5, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may result from a single distressing experience or recurring events of being overwhelmed that can be precipitated in weeks, years, or even decades as the person struggles to cope with the immediate circumstances, eventually leading to serious, long-term negative consequences.

Because trauma differs between individuals, according to their subjective experiences, people will react to similar traumatic events differently. In other words, not all people who experience a potentially traumatic event will actually become psychologically traumatized. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Storr CL, Ialongo NS, Anthony JC, Breslau N|year=2007|title=Childhood antecedents of exposure to traumatic events and post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=164|issue=1|pages=119–25|pmid=17202553|doi=10.1176/ajp.2007.164.1.119}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for some people to develop [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] ([[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]) after being exposed to a major traumatic event.&lt;ref name=":01"&gt;"Among individuals who do develop post-traumatic stress after exposure to a traumatic event, some develop symptoms sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD"

This discrepancy in risk rate can be attributed to [[protective factor]]s some individuals may have that enable them to cope with trauma; they are related to temperamental and environmental factors from among others. Some examples are mild exposure to stress early in life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fenoglio KA, Chen Y, Baram TZ|year=2006|title= Neuroplasticity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis early in life requires recurrent recruitment of stress-regulation brain regions|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=26|issue=9|pages=2434–2442|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4080-05.2006|pmid=16510721|pmc=2408688}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychological resilience|resilience]] characteristics, and active seeking of help.&lt;ref name="Wingo, Aliza P. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wingo, Aliza P, Ressler KJ, Bradley B|year=2014|title=Resilience characteristics mitigate tendency for harmful alcohol and illicit drug use in adults with a history of childhood abuse: A cross-sectional study of 2024 inner-city men and women|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=51|pages=93–99|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.01.007|pmid=24485848|pmc=4605671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR)]] defines trauma as direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury; threat to one's physical integrity, witnessing an event that involves the above experience, learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death, or injury experienced by a family member or close associate. Memories associated with trauma are implicit, pre-verbal and cannot be recalled, but can be triggered by stimuli from the [[in vivo]] environment. The person's response to aversive details of traumatic event involve intense fear, helplessness or horror. In children it is manifested as disorganized or agitative behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|title=DSM-IV-TR – DSM Library|publisher=|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|doi-broken-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma can be caused by a wide variety of events, but there are a few common aspects. There is frequently a violation of the person's core assumptions about the world and their [[human rights]], putting the person in a state of extreme [[Mental confusion|confusion]] and insecurity. This is seen when institutions depended upon for survival violate, humiliate, [[Betrayal Trauma|betray]], or cause major losses or separations instead of evoking aspects like positive self worth, safe boundaries and personal freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=DePrince, A.P.|author2=Freyd, J.J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|chapter=The Harm of Trauma: Pathological fear, shattered assumptions, or betrayal?|editor=J.

Psychologically traumatic experiences often involve [[physical trauma]] that threatens one's survival and sense of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional and Psychological Trauma|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/emotional_psychological_trauma.htm|work=Helpguide.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913234027/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/emotional_psychological_trauma.htm|archivedate=September 13, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical causes and dangers of psychological trauma include [[harassment]], [[embarrassment]], abandonment, abusive relationships, rejection, co-dependence, physical assault, [[sexual abuse]], partner battery, [[employment discrimination]], [[police brutality]], [[corruption#Judicial corruption|judicial corruption]] and [[Judicial misconduct|misconduct]], [[bullying]], [[paternalism]], [[domestic violence]], [[indoctrination]], being the victim of an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] parent, the threat or the witnessing of violence (particularly in [[childhood]]), life-threatening [[medical condition]]s, and medication-induced trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Charles|title=Psychiatric drugs as agents of Trauma|journal=The International Journal of Risk and Safety in Medicine|year=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=195–207|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/17668000738187w6/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128181725/http://iospress.metapress.com/content/17668000738187w6/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 January 2013|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic [[natural disaster]]s such as [[earthquake]]s and [[volcanic eruption]]s, large scale transportation accidents, [[Structure fire|house or domestic fire]], [[motor vehicle accident]], mass interpersonal violence like [[war]], [[terrorist attack]]s or other mass victimization like [[sex trafficking]], being taken as a hostage or being [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] can also cause psychological trauma. Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme [[poverty]] or other forms of [[abuse]], such as [[verbal abuse]], exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.

Some theories suggest [[childhood trauma]] can increase one's risk for [[mental disorder]]s including [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] ([[PTSD]]),&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, S.M., &amp; Boyle, G.J.

Parts of the brain in a growing child are developing in a sequential and hierarchical order, from least complex to most complex. The brain's neurons are designed to change in response to the constant external signals and stimulation, receiving and storing new information. This allows the brain to continually respond to its surroundings and promote survival. Our five main sensory signals contribute to the developing brain structure and its function.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Perry (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Infants and children begin to create internal representations of their external environment, and in particular, key attachment relationships, shortly after birth. Violent and victimizing attachment figures impact infants' and young children's internal representations.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schechter DS, Zygmunt A, Coates SW, Davies M, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Kolodji A, Robinson JL|author1link=Daniel Schechter|author3link=Susan Coates|year=2007|title=Caregiver traumatization adversely impacts young children's mental representations of self and others|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume=9|issue=3|pages=187–205|doi=10.1080/14616730701453762|pmid=18007959|pmc=2078523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more frequent a specific pattern of brain neurons is activated, the more permanent the internal representation associated with the pattern becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Krenawi; Graham; Kanat-Maymon, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This causes sensitization in the brain towards the specific neural network. Because of this sensitization, the neural pattern can be activated by decreasingly less external stimuli. 
Childhood abuse tends to have the most complications with long-term effects out of all forms of trauma because it occurs during the most sensitive and critical stages of psychological development.&lt;ref name="Wingo, Aliza P. 2014"/&gt; It could also lead to violent behavior, possibly as extreme as serial murder. For example, Hickey's Trauma-Control Model suggests that "[[Childhood trauma|childhood trauma]] for serial murderers may serve as a triggering mechanism resulting in an individual's inability to cope with the stress of certain events."&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, E. W. (2010). ''Serial Murderers and Their Victims.'' Blemont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often psychodynamic aspects of trauma are overlooked even by health professionals: "If clinicians fail to look through a trauma lens and to conceptualize client problems as related possibly to current or past trauma, they may fail to see that trauma victims, young and old, organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of reliving and warding off traumatic memories, reminders, and affects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effects of Psychological Trauma on Children and Adolescents|url=http://mentalhealth.vermont.gov/sites/dmh/files/report/cafu/DMH-CAFU_Psychological_Trauma_Moroz.pdf|format=PDF|date=June 30, 2005|author=Moroz, Kathleen J.|publisher=Vermont Agency of Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
People who go through these types of extremely traumatic experiences often have certain symptoms and problems afterward. The severity of these symptoms depends on the person, the type of trauma involved, and the emotional support they receive from others.  The range of reactions to and symptoms of trauma can be wide and varied, and differ in severity from person to person. A traumatized individual may experience one or several of them.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

After a traumatic experience, a person may '''re-experience''' the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma reminders, also called [[Trauma trigger|triggers]], can be uncomfortable and even painful. Re-experiencing can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, as well as their ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events are recurring. Flashbacks can range from distraction to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing of symptoms is a sign that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.

Triggers and cues act as reminders of the trauma and can cause [[anxiety]] and other associated emotions. Often the person can be completely unaware of what these triggers are. In many cases this may lead a person suffering from traumatic disorders to engage in disruptive behaviors or self-destructive coping mechanisms, often without being fully aware of the nature or causes of their own actions. [[Panic attack]]s are an example of a psychosomatic response to such emotional triggers.

Consequently, intense feelings of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may always seem to be present due to re-experiencing past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or [[flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashback]]s may haunt the person, and [[nightmare]]s may be frequent.&lt;ref name="Loyola"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|title=Loyola College in Maryland: Trauma and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028034430/http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|archivedate=2005-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insomnia]] may occur as lurking fears and insecurity keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. Trauma doesn't only cause changes in one's daily functions, but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generation, thus making genetics one of the components of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop protective factors such as genetics and sex that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frommberger|first=Ulrich|title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder – a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person may not remember what actually happened, while emotions experienced during the trauma may be re-experienced without the person understanding why (see [[Repressed memory|Repressed Memory]]). This can lead to the traumatic events being constantly experienced as if they were happening in the present, preventing the subject from gaining perspective on the experience. This can produce a pattern of prolonged periods of acute arousal punctuated by periods of physical and mental exhaustion. This can lead to mental health disorders like [[acute stress disorder|acute stress]] and anxiety disorder, [[traumatic grief]], [[undifferentiated somatoform disorder]], [[conversion disorder]]s, [[brief psychotic disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]], adjustment disorder, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rothschild B|title=The body remembers: the psychophysiology of trauma and trauma treatment |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-393-70327-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, emotional exhaustion may set in, leading to distraction, and clear thinking may be difficult or impossible. [[Emotional detachment]], as well as [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] or "numbing out" can frequently occur. Dissociating from the painful emotion includes numbing all emotion, and the person may seem emotionally flat, preoccupied, distant, or cold. Dissociation includes depersonalisation disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, etc. Exposure to and re-experiencing trauma can cause neurophysiological changes like slowed myelination, abnormalities in synaptic pruning, shrinking of the hippocampus, cognitive and affective impairment. This is significant in brain scan studies done regarding higher order function assessment with children and youth who were in vulnerable environments.

Some traumatized people may feel permanently damaged when trauma symptoms do not go away and they do not believe their situation will improve. This can lead to feelings of despair, transient paranoid ideation,  loss of [[self-esteem]], profound emptiness, suicidality, and frequently [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. If important aspects of the person's self and world understanding have been violated, the person may call their own identity into question.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/facts/general/fs_effects.html |title=Effects of Traumatic Experiences: A National Center for PTSD Fact Sheet |accessdate=2005-12-09 |last=Carlson |first=Eve B. |author2=Josef Ruzek  |publisher=National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder |doi= |archiveurl=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/clients/sub.cfm?source=mhealth/factsheets/effects |archivedate=2004-06-12 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often despite their best efforts, traumatized parents may have difficulty assisting their child with emotion regulation, attribution of meaning, and containment of post-traumatic fear in the wake of the child's traumatization, leading to adverse consequences for the child.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schechter DS, Coates SW, Kaminer T, Coots T, Zeanah CH, Davies M, Schonfield IS, Marshall RD, Liebowitz MR, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Myers MM|author1link=Daniel Schechter|author2link=Susan Coates|year=2008|title=Distorted maternal mental representations and atypical behavior in a clinical sample of violence-exposed mothers and their toddlers|journal=Journal of Trauma and Dissociation|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–149|doi=10.1080/15299730802045666|pmid=18985165|pmc=2577290}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such instances, seeking counselling in appropriate mental health services is in the best interests of both the child and the parent(s).
==Cause==

===Situational trauma===
Trauma can be caused by man-made, technological disasters and natural disasters,&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"&gt;Neria, Y., Nandi, A., &amp; Galea, S. (2008). Post-traumatic stress disorder following disasters: a systematic review. Psychological medicine, 38(4), 467–480. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; including war, abuse, violence, mechanized accidents (car, train, or plane crashes, etc.) or medical emergencies.

Responses to psychological trauma:
Response to psychological trauma can be varied based on the type of trauma, as well as socio demographic and background factors.&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"/&gt;
There are several behavioral responses common towards stressors including the proactive, reactive, and passive responses. Proactive responses include attempts to address and correct a stressor before it has a noticeable effect on lifestyle.  Reactive responses occur after the stress and possible trauma has occurred and are aimed more at correcting or minimizing the damage of a stressful event.  A passive response is often characterized by an emotional numbness or ignorance of a stressor.

Those who are able to be proactive can often overcome stressors and are more likely to be able to cope well with unexpected situations.  On the other hand, those who are more reactive will often experience more noticeable effects from an unexpected stressor. In the case of those who are passive, victims of a stressful event are more likely to suffer from long-term traumatic effects and often enact no intentional coping actions. These observations may suggest that the level of trauma associated with a victim is related to such independent coping abilities.

There is also a distinction between trauma induced by recent situations and long-term trauma which may have been buried in the unconscious from past situations such as [[childhood abuse]]. Trauma is sometimes overcome through healing; in some cases this can be achieved by recreating or revisiting the origin of the trauma under more psychologically safe circumstances, such as with a [[Psychotherapy|therapist]].

===In psychoanalysis===
{{main article|Psychoanalysis}}

French neurologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] argued in the 1890s that psychological trauma was the origin of all instances of the mental illness known as [[hysteria]].  Charcot's "traumatic hysteria" often manifested as a paralysis that followed a physical trauma, typically years later after what Charcot described as a period of "incubation".
[[Sigmund Freud]], Charcot's student and the father of [[psychoanalysis]], examined the concept of psychological trauma throughout his career.  [[Jean Laplanche]] has given a general description of Freud's understanding of trauma, which varied significantly over the course of Freud's career: "An event in the subject's life, defined by its intensity, by the subject's incapacity to respond adequately to it and by the upheaval and long-lasting effects that it brings about in the psychical organization".&lt;ref name = Laplanche&gt;{{cite book |author1=Laplanche, J.  |author2=Pontalis, J.B. | year=1967 | title=The Language of Psycho-Analysis | publisher=W. W. Norton and Company | isbn=978-0-393-01105-0  | pages=465–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] claimed that what he called "[[The Real]]" had a traumatic quality external to symbolization. As an object of anxiety, Lacan maintained that The Real is "the essential object which isn't an object any longer, but this something faced with which all words cease and all categories fail, the object of anxiety ''par excellence''".&lt;ref name="seminar_II"&gt;Lacan, J., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II: The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis 1954–1955'' | p.164 (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1991), {{ISBN|978-0-393-30709-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress disorders===
{{main article|Posttraumatic stress disorder|Complex post-traumatic stress disorder}}
All psychological traumas originate from stress, a physiological response to an unpleasant stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-205-23939-9|title=Physiology of Psychology|author=Carlson, Neil|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grossarth-Maticek, R., Eysenck, H.J., &amp; Boyle, G.J. (1994). An empirical study of the diathesis-stress theory of disease. ''International Journal of Stress Management, 1'', 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Long term stress increases the risk of poor mental health and mental disorders, which can be attributed to secretion of glucocorticoids for a long period of time. Such prolonged exposure causes many physiological dysfunctions such as the suppression of the immune system and increase in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seyle, H.|title=The Stress of Life|journal=McGraw Hill|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does it affect the body physiologically, but a morphological change in the hippocampus also takes place. Studies showed that extreme stress early in life can disrupt normal development of hippocampus and impact its functions in adulthood. Studies surely show a correlation between the size of hippocampus and one's susceptibility to stress disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brunson|title=Mechanisms of late-onset cognitive decline after early-life stress|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|year=2005|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In times of war, psychological trauma has been known as shell shock or [[combat stress reaction]]. Psychological trauma may cause an [[acute stress reaction]] which may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  PTSD emerged as the label for this condition after the [[Vietnam War]] in which many veterans returned to their respective countries demoralized, and sometimes, addicted to psychoactive substances. The symptoms of PTSD must persist for at least a month for diagnosis. The main symptoms of PTSD consist of four main categories: trauma (i.e. intense fear), reliving (i.e. flashbacks), avoidance behavior (i.e. emotional numbing), and hypervigilance (i.e. continuous scanning of the environment for danger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frommberger, Ulrich|year=2014|title=Post-traumatic stress disorder – a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|volume=111|issue=5|pages=59–65|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2014.0059|pmid=24612528|pmc=3952004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that about 60% of the US population reported as having experienced at least one traumatic symptom in their lives, but only a small proportion actually develops PTSD. There is a correlation between the risk of PTSD and whether or not the act was inflicted deliberately by the offender.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"/&gt; Psychological trauma is treated with therapy and, if indicated, psychotropic medications.

The term ''continuous post traumatic stress disorder'' (CTSD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Straker|first=Gillian|title=The continuous traumatic stress syndrome: The single therapeutic interview|journal=Psychology and Society|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced into the trauma literature by Gill Straker (1987). It was originally used by South African clinicians to describe the effects of exposure to frequent, high levels of violence usually associated with civil conflict and political repression. The term is also applicable to the effects of exposure to contexts in which gang violence and crime are endemic as well as to the effects of ongoing exposure to life threats in high-risk occupations such as police, fire and emergency services.

As one of the processes of treatment, confrontation with their sources of trauma plays a crucial role. While debriefing people immediately after a critical incident has not been shown to reduce incidence of PTSD, coming alongside people experiencing trauma in a supportive way has become standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McNally RJ |author2=Bryant RA |author3=Ehlers A | title=Does early psychological intervention promote recovery from posttraumatic stress? | journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume=4 | issue=2 | year=2003 | pages=45–79| doi = 10.1111/1529-1006.01421|pmid=26151755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vicarious===
Vicarious trauma affects workers who witnesses their clients' trauma. It is more likely to occur in situations where trauma related work is the norm rather than the exception. Listening with empathy to the clients generates feeling, and seeing oneself in clients' trauma may compound the risk for developing trauma symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2008/phac-aspc/H72-21-178-2000E.pdf|title=Guidebook on Vicarious Trauma: Recommended Solutions for Anti-Violence Workers|publisher=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may also result if workers witness situations that happen in the course of their work (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/dr-john-bradford-won-t-work-magnotta-case-because-of-ptsd-1.2571463|title=Russell Williams profiler won't work Magnotta case because of PTSD|publisher=CBC|date= March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of help seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.

==Assessment==

As "trauma" adopted a more widely defined scope, traumatology as a field developed a more interdisciplinary approach. This is in part due to the field's diverse professional representation including: psychologists, medical professionals, and lawyers. As a result, findings in this field are adapted for various applications, from individual psychiatric treatments to sociological large-scale trauma management. However, novel fields require novel methodologies. While the field has adopted a number of diverse methodological approaches, many pose their own limitations in practical application.

The experience and outcomes of psychological trauma can be assessed in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Briere, John |author2=Scott, Catherine |title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc |location=California |year=2006 |pages=37–63 |isbn=978-0-7619-2921-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of a clinical interview, the risk of imminent danger to the self or others is important to address but is not the focus of assessment. In most cases, it will not be necessary to involve contacting emergency services (e.g., medical, psychiatric, law enforcement) to ensure the individuals safety; members of the individual's [[social support]] network are much more critical.

Understanding and accepting the psychological state an individual is in is paramount. There are many misconceptions of what it means for a traumatized individual to be in psychological crisis. These are times when an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and incapable of self-comfort. If treated humanely and respectfully the individual is less likely to resort to self harm. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and to communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance, the individual will be taken seriously rather than being treated as delusional. It is vital for the assessor to understand that what is going on in the traumatized person's head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., post-traumatic symptoms, dissociation, [[substance abuse]], somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established [[rapport]] and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. The clinician may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]], and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, the clinician is better able to assess the individual's ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.

During assessment, individuals may exhibit activation responses in which reminders of the traumatic event trigger sudden feelings (e.g., [[distress (medicine)|distress]], anxiety, [[anger]]), memories, or thoughts relating to the event. Because individuals may not yet be capable of managing this distress, it is necessary to determine how the event can be discussed in such a way that will not "retraumatize" the individual. It is also important to take note of such responses, as these responses may aid the clinician in determining the intensity and severity of possible post traumatic stress as well as the ease with which responses are triggered. Further, it is important to note the presence of possible avoidance responses. Avoidance responses may involve the absence of expected activation or emotional reactivity as well as the use of avoidance mechanisms (e.g., substance use, effortful avoidance of cues associated with the event, dissociation).

In addition to monitoring activation and avoidance responses, clinicians carefully observe the individual's strengths or difficulties with affect regulation (i.e., affect tolerance and affect modulation). Such difficulties may be evidenced by mood swings, brief yet intense [[depressive episode]]s, or [[self-mutilation]]. The information gathered through observation of affect regulation will guide the clinician's decisions regarding the individual's readiness to partake in various therapeutic activities.

Though assessment of psychological trauma may be conducted in an unstructured manner, assessment may also involve the use of a structured interview. Such interviews might include the [[Clinician Administered PTSD Scale|Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale]] (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI; Bryant, Harvey, Dang, &amp; Sackville, 1998), Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES; Pelcovitz et al., 1997), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders- Revised (SCID-D; Steinberg, 1994), and Brief Interview for post-traumatic Disorders (BIPD; Briere, 1998).

Lastly, assessment of psychological trauma might include the use of self-administered psychological tests. Individual scores on such tests are compared to normative data in order to determine how the individual's level of functioning compares to others in a sample representative of the general population. Psychological testing might include the use of generic tests (e.g., [[MMPI-2]], [[MCMI-III]], SCL-90-R) to assess non-trauma-specific symptoms as well as difficulties related to personality. In addition, psychological testing might include the use of trauma-specific tests to assess post-traumatic outcomes. Such tests might include the post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS; Foa, 1995), Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS: Davidson et al., 1997), Detailed Assessment of post-traumatic Stress (DAPS; Briere, 2001), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI: Briere, 1995), Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC; Briere, 1996), Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ: Kubany et al., 2000), and Trauma-related Guilt Inventory (TRGI: Kubany et al., 1996).

Children are assessed through activities and therapeutic relationship, some of the activities are play genogram, sand worlds, coloring feelings, Self and Kinetic family drawing, symbol work, dramatic-puppet play, story telling, Briere's TSCC, etc.&lt;ref name="GilATC"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliana Gil|title=Helping Abused and Traumatized Children: Integrating Directive and Nondirective Approaches|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qe-E0CYLDqcC&amp;pg=PA28|year=2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-60918-474-2|pages=28, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
A number of psychotherapy approaches have been designed with the treatment of trauma in mind—[[Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing|EMDR]], [[progressive counting (PC)]], [[somatic experiencing]], [[biofeedback]], [[Internal Family Systems Model|Internal Family Systems Therapy]], and [[sensorimotor psychotherapy]].

There is a large body of empirical support for the use of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abct.org/Information/?m=mInformation&amp;fa=_WhatIsCBTpublic|title=What is Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)?|publisher=Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schnurr-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schnurr | first1 = PP. | last2 = Friedman | first2 = MJ. | last3 = Engel | first3 = CC. | last4 = Foa | first4 = EB. | last5 = Shea | first5 = MT. | last6 = Chow | first6 = BK. | last7 = Resick | first7 = PA. | last8 = Thurston | first8 = V. | last9 = Orsillo | first9 = SM. | last10 = Haug | first10 = Rodney | last11 = Turner | first11 = Carole | last12 = Bernardy | first12 = Nancy | title = Cognitive behavioral therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in women: a randomized controlled trial | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 8 | pages = 820–30 |date=Feb 2007 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.8.820 | pmid = 17327524 | display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  for the treatment of trauma-related symptoms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abct.org/Information/?m=mInformation&amp;fa=fs_TRAUMA|title=ABCT Fact Sheets: Trauma|publisher=Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Studies funded by pharmaceuticals have also shown that medications such as the new anti-depressants are effective when used in combination with other psychological approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phase-oriented treatment of structural dissociation in complex traumatization: overcoming trauma-related phobias|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|year=2005|volume=6|issue=3|pages=11–53|vauthors=Steele K, van der Hart O, Nijenhuis ER|pmid=16172081|doi=10.1300/J229v06n03_02|citeseerx=10.1.1.130.8227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma therapy allows processing trauma-related memories and allows growth towards more adaptive psychological functioning. It helps to develop positive coping instead of negative coping and allows the individual to integrate upsetting-distressing material (thoughts, feelings and memories) and to resolve these internally. It also aids in growth of personal skills like resilience, ego regulation, empathy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFMXBAAAQBAJ|title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment (DSM-5 Update)|first1=John N.|last1=Briere|first2=Catherine|last2=Scott|date=25 March 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781483351254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes involved in trauma therapy are:

* Psychoeducation: Information dissemination and educating in vulnerabilities and adoptable coping mechanisms.
* Emotional regulation: Identifying, countering discriminating, grounding thoughts and emotions from internal construction to an external representation.
* Cognitive processing: Transforming negative perceptions and beliefs about self, others and environment to positive ones through cognitive reconsideration or re-framing.
* Trauma processing: Systematic desensitization, response activation and counter-conditioning, titrated extinction of emotional response, deconstructing disparity (emotional vs. reality state), resolution of traumatic material (in theory, to a state in which triggers no longer produce harmful distress and the individual is able to express relief.)
* Emotional processing: Reconstructing perceptions, beliefs and erroneous expectations, habituating new life contexts for auto-activated trauma-related fears, and providing crisis cards with coded emotions and appropriate cognitions. (This stage is only initiated in pre-termination phase from clinical assessment and judgement of the mental health professional.)
* [[Gestalt therapy|Experiential]] processing: Visualization of achieved relief state and relaxation methods.

A number of complementary approaches to trauma treatment have been implicated as well, including yoga and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pradhan|first=Basant|last2=Kluewer D’Amico|first2=Jessica|last3=Makani|first3=Ramkrishna|last4=Parikh|first4=Tapan|date=2015-07-10|title=Nonconventional interventions for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder: Ketamine, repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and alternative approaches|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=35–54|doi=10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|issn=1529-9732}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trauma-sensitive yoga]] has been specifically developed for the purposes of use with traumatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emerson|first=D.|last2=Sharma|first2=R.|last3=Chaudhry|first3=S.|last4=Turner|first4=J.|date=2009|title=Trauma-sensitive yoga: principles, practice, and research|url=|journal=International Journal of Yoga Therapy|volume=19|pages=123-128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3681">'''''SEMMA''''' is an  acronym that stands for ''Sample'', ''Explore'', ''Modify'', ''Model'', and ''Assess''. It is a list of sequential steps developed by [[SAS Institute]], one of the largest producers of [[statistics]] and [[business intelligence]] software. It guides the implementation of [[data mining]] applications.&lt;ref name="AzevedoSantos"&gt;Azevedo, A. and Santos, M. F. [http://www.iadis.net/dl/final_uploads/200812P033.pdf KDD, SEMMA and CRISP-DM: a parallel overview]. In Proceedings of the IADIS European Conference on Data Mining 2008, pp 182-185. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109114939/http://www.iadis.net/dl/final_uploads/200812P033.pdf |date=January 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although SEMMA is often considered to be a general data mining methodology, SAS claims that it is "rather a logical organization of the functional tool set of" one of their products, SAS Enterprise Miner, "for carrying out the core tasks of data mining".&lt;ref name="sasweb"&gt;[http://www.sas.com/offices/europe/uk/technologies/analytics/datamining/miner/semma.html/ SAS Enterprise Miner website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308165638/http://www.sas.com/offices/europe/uk/technologies/analytics/datamining/miner/semma.html/ |date=March 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the expanding field of data mining, there has been a call for a standard methodology or a simply list of [[best practices]] for the diversified and iterative process of data mining that users can apply to their data mining projects regardless of industry. While the [[Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining]] or CRISP-DM, founded by the [[European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology]] initiative, aimed to create a neutral methodology, SAS also offered a pattern to follow in its data mining tools.

==Phases of SEMMA==
The phases of SEMMA and related tasks are the following:&lt;ref name="sasweb"/&gt;
* '''Sample'''. The process starts with [[sampling (statistics)|data sampling]], e.g., selecting the data set for modeling. The data set should be large enough to contain sufficient information to retrieve, yet small enough to be used efficiently. This phase also deals with data partitioning.
* '''Explore'''. This phase covers the understanding of the data by discovering anticipated and unanticipated relationships between the variables, and also abnormalities, with the help of [[data visualization]].
* '''Modify'''. The Modify phase contains methods to select, create and transform variables in preparation for data modeling.
* '''Model'''.  In the Model phase the focus is on applying various modeling (data mining) techniques on the prepared variables in order to create models that possibly provide the desired outcome.
* '''Assess'''. The last phase is Assess. The evaluation of the modeling results shows the reliability and usefulness of the created models.

==Criticism==
SEMMA mainly focuses on the modeling tasks of data mining projects, leaving the business aspects out (unlike, e.g., CRISP-DM and its Business Understanding phase). Additionally, SEMMA is designed to help the users of the SAS Enterprise Miner software. Therefore, applying it outside Enterprise Miner can be ambiguous.&lt;ref name="RohanizadehMoghadam"&gt;Rohanizadeh, S. S. and Moghadam, M. B.

'''Shimon Bejarano''' ({{lang-he|שמעון בז'רנו}}, 28 September 1910 &amp;ndash; 17 October 1971) was an [[Israel]]i industrialist and politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for the [[General Zionists]] between 1951 and 1959.

==Biography==
Born in [[Plovdiv]] in [[Bulgaria]], Bejarano was educated at the Fraunfeld [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Switzerland]] before studying economics at the [[University of Milan]]. He made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1936. Together with his three brothers he established the Bejarno Bros cigarette factory and Assis Citrus juices and canned fruit plant.&lt;ref name=PA&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=289 Shimon Bejarno: Public Activities] Knesset&lt;/ref&gt; A member of [[Bank Leumi]]'s Board of directors, he was also a member of the Advisory Board of the [[Bank of Israel]].&lt;ref name=PA/&gt;

Bejarano was a member of the General Zionists and was elected to the Knesset after being placed eighth on the party's list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1951|1951 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.idi.org.il/media/6735/%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%AA-2-%D7%94%D7%A1%D7%AA%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D.pdf General Zionists list] Israel Democracy Institute&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1955|1955]], but did not stand for re-election in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1959|1959 elections]] following the early death of his brothers Joseph and Moshe.

He died in 1971 at the age of 61.

== Life, business, and political career ==
Somchai was born as the son of a village headman, the second of eight siblings. He dropped out of school after grade four&lt;ref name="Godfather"&gt;{{Citation |title='Kamnan Poh': The long-living godfather |work=The Nation |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/Kamnan-Poh-The-long-living-godfather-66927.html |accessdate=20 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started working as a teenager. He began as a restaurant bus boy before starting his own bus service. After some time as a monk and as a soldier, he became the partner of a French businessman active in the fishing industry in 1963.&lt;ref name="Godfather"/&gt; He married Satil Sancharoen, daughter of a fish trader. Later he expanded to the building sector, establishing his company ''Bang Saen Maha Nakhon''. In 1968, he became headman ("kamnan") of Saen Suk sub-district. He opened a liquor distributorship, and later broadened his economic empire to several other industries.&lt;ref name="25 years"/&gt; Most profitable were his activities in the construction and real estate sectors. He engaged in illegal activities like smuggling strategic goods during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] war and the [[Cambodian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Naoi"&gt;{{Citation |first=Megumi |last=Naoi |title=Contested Forces?: Economic openness and political responses to regional inequality in East Asia |publisher=Columbia University |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national government started to develop the [[Eastern seaboard of Thailand|eastern seaboard]] as an industrial region in the 1980s. Somchai became a key intermediary between the central government and multinational and local investors. This spurred the rise of his economic and political influence which he, in turn, used to provide for a further boost of the urban and industrial development of his home province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Rohini |last=Pande |title=Understanding Political Corruption in Low Income Countries |work=Handbook of Development Economics |volume=4 |publisher=North-Holland |year=2008 |page=3163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Peter J. |last1=Rimmer |first2=Howard |last2=Dick |title=The City in Southeast Asia: Patterns, Processes and Policy |publisher=National University of Singapore Press |year=2009 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Saen Suk (which includes the much frequented beach resort of Bang Saen) received the status of a municipality and Somchai, as the only candidate, became its first mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Nicholas |last=Grossman |title=Kamnan Poh named first Bang Saen mayor |work=Chronicle of Thailand: Headline News Since 1946 |publisher=Editions Didier Millet |year=2009 |page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Thai Nation Party]], which Somchai supported, won the national election in 1995 and its leader [[Banharn Silpa-archa]] became prime minister, he was often rewarded with government contracts. The combined assets of the Khunpluem and Sancharoen families were estimated on four billion baht in 2004.&lt;ref name="25 years"/&gt;

Somchai enlisted as a canvasser for the [[Social Action Party]] in the 1970s. He later supported the [[Justice Unity Party]] (1992), the [[National Development Party (Thailand)|National Development Party]] (1992-95) and the [[Thai Nation Party]] (1995-2001).&lt;ref name="Godfather"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Sombat |last=Chantornvong |title=Local Godfathers in Thai Politics |work=Money and power in Provincial Thailand |publisher=NIAS Press |year=2000 |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gW9Z0-q_xwC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=%22somchai+khunpluem%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=goVCT-XAHJGLhQfrtO3eBQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kamnan%20poh%22&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without holding a high office, he was considered one of the most influential political figures of Thailand until 2004. Whichever party he supported usually won most of the electoral districts of Chonburi Province. By financially supporting parties and candidates, he controlled up to 20 seats in the Thai [[House of Representatives (Thailand)|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="Naoi"/&gt;

== Murder case ==
Somchai, together with local councillor Passakorn Homhuan, was charged with the [[premeditated murder]] of Prayoon Sithichote, [[Kamnan|headman]] of a neighbouring sub-district, through hired killers in 2003.&lt;ref name="Sontaya"&gt;{{Citation |title=Sontaya: Dad's fine, preparing for bail |work=The Nation |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/Sontaya-Dads-fine-preparing-for-bail-77047.html |accessdate=20 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were sentenced to 25 years in jail by the criminal court in June 2004. Pending appeal proceedings, Somchai was set free on terms of a ten million baht bail.&lt;ref name="25 years"/&gt; The appeals court confirmed the verdict in October 2005. He was also convicted in a [[corruption]] case in connection with the construction of a garbage dump, for which he was sentenced to five years and four months in jail. Somchai, however, was absent from the trials, jumped bail and lived in hiding for several years.&lt;ref name="BP"&gt;{{Citation |title=Court seizes Kamnan Poh's B15m bail bond |work=Bangkok Post |date=29 Nov 2011 |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/crimes/268439/kamnan-poh-daughter-fined-b15m |accessdate=20 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Fugitive politician's absence in court will cost daughter Bt15m |work=The Nation |date=30 Nov 2011 |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/national/Fugitive-politicians-absence-in-court-will-cost-da-30170928.html |accessdate=20 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested on 30 January 2013 on his way to a hospital in Bangkok's Pattanakarn area.

== Family ==
Somchai is the father of [[Sontaya Kunplome]],&lt;ref name="Sontaya"/&gt; leader of the [[Phalang Chon Party]], president of [[Pattaya United F.C.]], [[Ministry of Culture (Thailand)|minister of culture]] under [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] and former [[Ministry of Tourism and Sports (Thailand)|tourism minister]] under [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], [[Wittaya Khunpluem]], president of [[Chonburi F.C.]], chairman of the provincial administrative council of Chonburi and Member of Parliament representing Chonburi, and [[Ittipol Khunplome]], mayor of [[Pattaya]].

'''Stefan Günther Tweraser''' (Born 18 November 1969) is an Austrian business executive, consultant, and entrepreneur. Tweraser is known primarily for his leadership roles in the European technology and telecommunications industries. In December 2015 he was named as CEO of the Berlin-based hospitality analytics firm SnapShot GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SnapShot appoints former Google Germany director as first chief executive|url=http://www.travolution.co.uk/articles/2016/01/20/14880/snapshot-appoints-former-google-germany-director-as-first-chief-executive.html|publisher=Travolution|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gavrilescu|first1=Delia|title=Former Google Exec Dr. Stefan Tweraser Named SnapShot GmbH CEO|url=http://www.argophilia.com/news/15856-2/215856/|work=argophilia.com|date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Tweraser grew up in Vienna, Austria, along with his three siblings. He attended the [[Höhere Technische Lehranstalt|Higher Technical Institute HTL]] in Vienna for Telecommunications Engineering and later studied Business Administration at the [[Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien|Vienna University of Economics and Business]], where he was also employed from 1994 to 1997 as an assistant, and then completed his doctorate in 1997.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; Up until April 1998, Tweraser was employed as a director of studies for Marketing and Sales at the Vienna University of Applied Sciences. In early 2015, he was in a course of advanced study in psychotherapy at the [[Sigmund Freud University Vienna]].

== Career ==
In 1998, Tweraser was appointed as a management consultant by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seifert|first1=edited by Alexander H. Kracklauer, D. Quinn Mills, Dirk|title=Collaborative Customer Relationship Management Taking CRM to the Next Level|date=2004|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=3540247106|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was made a partner in January 2003.  Later in 2003, he was named Divisional Head of Retail Marketing at [[Telekom Austria]] AG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. Stefan Tweraser has been Named Head of Marketing at Telekom Austria|url=http://www.a1.net/newsroom/en/2003/06/20030612_dr-stefan-tweraser-wird-marketing-leiter-von-telekom-austria/|work=a1.net|date=12 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was responsible for product management, market communication and the company's Internet activities until his departure in 2007. During a reorganisation of the Landline division, Tweraser was responsible for sensitive personnel and budget cuts. The Telekom executive was named "Marketer of the Year 2005″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.a1.net/newsroom/en/2006/09/20060920_telekom-austria-marketingleiter-stefan-tweraser-als-marketer-des-jahres-ausgezeichnet|title=Telekom Austria Marketing Head Stefan Tweraser Named Marketer of the Year|work=a1.net|date=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Austrian chapter of the [[International Advertising Association]] (IAA). In December 2006, he was elected president of the Austrian Volleyball Federation at the request of Telekom, which at that time was the main sponsor of the federation.

After leaving Telekom Austria, Tweraser moved to Google Deutschland, where he succeeded Christian Baudis as Country Director Sales as of May 2008. Between 2007 and 2008, he was also briefly employed as the managing director of Omnimedia Werbegesellschaft, a holding of Telekom. During this time he also took over as head of Google Austria and Switzerland, when Karl Pall moved to assume his role as head of Google Canada. The newly appointed Google executive was instrumental for the search giant's marketing efforts, especially to the underdeveloped small and medium sized enterprises ([[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMEs]]) in Austria and Switzerland.

Tweraser was in the thick of the 2012 Google Internet campaign to garner public support against a proposed law that would force the search engine giant to pay publishers for content offered on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scally|first1=Derek|title=Black day for German media as paper prints final edition|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/black-day-for-german-media-as-paper-prints-final-edition-1.1691|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-defend-your-net/53226/ Google “Defend Your Net” Campaign in Germany Heats Up] Mihaela Lica, Search Engine Journal, 29 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=David|title=Google launches petition against German 'link tax' proposals|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-launches-petition-against-german-link-tax-proposals/|work=[[Zdnet]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draft law, which was dubbed the "Lex Google", was intended to force search engines to pay a fee to publishers when Internet users click through to their content. German lawmakers condemned Google's campaign against the proposed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-germany-google-idUSBRE8AR0UI20121128 German lawmakers condemn Google campaign against copyright law ] Madeline Chambers of Reuters, 28 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, the author of the proposed legislation, said she was ''"astonished that Google was trying to monopolize opinion-making."'' In an interview with Phys.org in November 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2012-11-google-german-copyright-law.html Google hits back against German copyright law] Phys.org 27 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Tweraser was quoted as commenting: ''"The majority of citizens have never heard of this draft law even though it could affect all Internet users in Germany."'' The Google executive went on to describe "restrictions to content" and to users' access, along with the higher costs that would be incurred. He also participated in a number of high level meetings and summits where the future of search was the focus.&lt;ref&gt;"Diverging logic in convergent worlds (PDF)" [http://media.medientage.de/mediathek/textservice/files/pdf/12_text_2012_1351171117.pdf] With Dr. Miriam Meckel at the MEDIENTAGE MUNICH 2012 Media Summit&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an announcement of the arraignment of Tweraser on charges of breach of trust in the so-called Telekom scandal, he stepped down from his position at Google in January 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[https://thenextweb.com/google/2013/01/15/google-germany-sales-exec-steps-down/#gref Google Germany Sales Exec Steps Down] Robin Wauters, The Next Web, 13 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; before finally leaving the search-engine and advertising group at the end of February of that year.

In December 2015, the Austrian hospitality analytics company, SnapShot GmbH appointed Tweraser chief executive officer. Tweraser joined a team of hotel innovators, investors, marketing and entrepreneurial executives from across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=288361809 Company Overview of SnapShot GmbH] Bloomberg, Internet Software and Services&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/snapshot-gmbh#/entity SnapShot GmbH] Crunchbase Company Profile&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telekom II scandal==
On 4 December 2012, the department of public prosecution in Vienna arraigned Tweraser and three other persons on charges of breach of trust. The former Telekom executive was accused of having illegally obtained over half a million euros from Telekom Austria with the help of the advertising agency [[Havas Worldwide|Euro-RSCG]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-10/google-german-exec-charged-over-telekom-austria-kickbacks Google German Exec Charged Over Telekom Austria Kickbacks] Bloomberg, 10 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Tweraser joined Google Deutschland, he reached an agreement in the context of the termination of his contract in 2007 with the Telekom manager Gernot Schieszler under which he would be paid an additional settlement on dismissal in the amount of two annual salaries. The agency, which was managed at that time by the advertisers Gustav Eder-Neuhauser and Albert Essenther, managed the 2.5&amp;nbsp;million euro advertising budget of Telekom. According to the arraignment, the agency bosses gave their consent to "process this 'informal settlement on dismissal' via Euro-RSCG". For this purpose, Telekom was sent a pro-forma invoice in July 2007 for the sum of 585,600 euros for the "Strategic design of the sponsorship appearance in the context of Euro 2008".  Following the official departure of Tweraser from Telekom, he submitted three pro-forma invoices on behalf of his company Gekko Consulting GmbH. Although all the defendants confirmed the cash flows, they each refuted any criminally liable responsibility.

The trial (nicknamed) Telekom II began on 25 February 2014 in the Vienna Regional Court for Criminal Matters. At the adjourning of this initial trial Telekom Austria announced that Tweraser would begin to pay back the adjudicated amount in installments. Then in February 2015, Judge Michael Tolstiuk ruled that the [[Corpus delicti]] regarding breach of trust was not sufficient and that Telekom had not suffered any damage due to the payments to Tweraser. The judgement acquitted all the defendants of any wrongdoing.
