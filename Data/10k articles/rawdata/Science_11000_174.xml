      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26726">'''Academic studies of the political groups of the European Parliament''' refers to the studies of [[Political groups of the European Parliament|those groups]] by academics, the methods that they use and the conclusions that they reach.

==Background==
{{main|Political groups of the European Parliament}}
The [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] of the [[European Parliament]] have been around in one form or another since September 1952 and the first meeting of the Parliament's predecessor, the Common Assembly. The groups are coalitions of [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] and the [[European political party|Europarties]] and [[political party|national parties]] that those MEPs belong to. The groups have coalesced into representations of the dominant schools of European political thought and are the primary actors in the Parliament.

Some of the groups (such as PES) have become homogeneous units coterminous with their Europarty, some (such as IND/DEM) have not. But they are still coalitions, not parties in their own right, and do not issue [[manifesto]]s of their own. It may therefore be difficult to discern how the groups intend to vote without first inspecting the [[party platform]]s of their constituent parties, and then with limited certainty.

Additionally, national media focus on the MEPs/national parties of their own member state, neglecting the group's activities and poorly understanding their structure or even existence. Transnational media coverage of the groups ''per se'' is limited to those organs such as the Parliament itself, or those news media (e.g. EUObserver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/ |title=EUobserver |publisher=EUobserver |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101546/http://euobserver.com/| archivedate= 18 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or theParliament.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theparliament.com/ |title=EU Politics News and Policy |publisher=TheParliament.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100628095128/http://www.theparliament.com/| archivedate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that specialise in the Parliament. These organs cover the groups in detail but with little overarching analysis. So although such organs make it easy to find out how a group acted on a specific vote, they provide little information on the voting patterns of a specific group.

As a result, the only bodies providing analysis of the voting patterns and [[Weltanschauung]] of the groups are academics.

==Academics==
Academics analysing the groups include [[Simon Hix]] ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]), [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/kreppel/ Amie Kreppel] [[University of Florida]], [[Abdul Noury]] ([[Free University of Brussels]]), [[Gérard Roland (economist)|Gérard Roland]], ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), [[Gail McElroy]] ([[Trinity College, Dublin]], Department of Political Science), [[Kenneth Benoit]] ([[Trinity College, Dublin]] - Institute for International Integration Studies (IIIS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IIIS (Email) |url=http://www.tcd.ie/iiis/ |title=Institute for International Integration Studies (IIIS) : Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, Ireland |publisher=Tcd.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Friedrich Heinemann]], [[Philipp Mohl]], and [[Steffen Osterloh]] ([[University of Mannheim]] - Centre for European Economic Research&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zew.de/en/&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Results==

===Positions on economy and euroscepticism===

The results for each group are shown in the adjacent diagram. The vertical scale is anti-pro Europe spectrum, (0% = extremely anti-Europe, 100% = extremely pro), and the horizontal scale is economic left-right spectrum, (0% = extremely economically left-wing, 100% = extremely economically right-wing). The results are also shown in the table below.

Two of the groups (EPP-ED and IND/DEM) were split. EPP-ED are split on Euroscepticism: the EPP subgroup ( {{legend2|#3399FF|}}) were centre-right Europhiles, whereas the ED subgroup ( {{legend2|#0000FF|}}) were right-wing Eurosceptics.

IND/DEM was also split along its subgroups: the reformist subgroup ( {{legend2|#FF9900|}}, bottom-center) voted as centrist Eurosceptics, and the secessionist subgroup ( {{legend2|#FF9900|}}, middle-right) voted as right-wing Euroneutrals. The reformist subgroup was able to pursue a reformist agenda via the Parliament. The secessionist subgroup was unable to pursue a secessionist agenda there (it's out of the Parliament's purview) and pursued a right-wing agenda instead. This resulted in the secessionist subgroup being ''less'' eurosceptic in terms of roll-call votes than other, non-eurosceptic parties. UKIP (the major component of the secessionist subgroup) was criticised for this seeming abandonment of its Eurosceptic core principles.&lt;ref name="Times1845227"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1845227.ece Leader of the UKIP accused of selling out, The Sunday Times, May 27, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517032543/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1845227.ece |date=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EUL/NGL and G/EFA voted closely together, as did PES and ALDE, and EPP-ED and UEN. Surprisingly, given that PES and EPP-ED are partners in the Grand Coalition, they were not each other's closest allies, although they did vote with each other about two-thirds of the time. IND/DEM did not have close allies within the political groups, preferring instead to cooperate most closely with the [[Non-Inscrits]].

EUL/NGL and G/EFA were the most left-wing groups, UEN and EDD the most right-wing, and that was mirrored in their attitudes towards taxation, homosexual equality, abortion, euthanasia and controlling migration into the EU. The groups fell into two distinct camps regarding further development of EU authority, with UEN and EDD definitely against and the rest broadly in favor. Opinion was wider on the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]], with only PES, ELDR and EPP-ED in favor and the others against. Unsurprisingly, G/EFA was far more in favor of Green issues compared to the other groups.

===Group switching===
Party group switching in the European Parliament is the phenomenon where parliamentarians individually or collectively switch from one party group to the other. The phenomenon of EP party group switching is a well-known contributor to the volatility of the EP party system and highlights the fluidity that characterizes the composition of European parliamentary groups. On average 9% of all MEPs switch during legislative terms. Party group switching is a phenomenon that gained force especially in the legislatures during the 1990s, up to a maximum of 18% for the 1989-1994 term, with strong prevalence among representatives from France and Italy, though by no means limited to those two countries. There is a clear tendency of party group switches from the ideological extremes, both left and right, toward the center. Most switching takes place at the outset of legislative terms, with another peak around the half-term moment, when responsibilities rotate within the EP hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, A.M. and M. Vink (2012). Measuring Group Switching in the European Parliament: Methodology, Data and Trends (1979-2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8315">'''Algebraic statistics''' is the use of [[algebra]] to advance [[statistics]]. Algebra has been useful for [[design of experiments|experimental design]], [[parameter estimation]], and [[hypothesis testing]].

Traditionally, algebraic statistics has been associated with the design of experiments and [[multivariate analysis]] (especially [[time series]]). In recent years, the term "algebraic statistics" has been sometimes restricted, sometimes being used to label the use of [[algebraic geometry]] and [[commutative algebra]] in statistics.

==The tradition of algebraic statistics==
In the past, statisticians have used algebra to advance research in statistics. Some algebraic statistics led to the development of new topics in algebra and combinatorics, such as [[association scheme]]s.

===Design of experiments===
For example, [[Ronald A. Fisher]], [[Henry Mann|Henry B. Mann]], and [[Rosemary A. Bailey]] applied [[Abelian group]]s to the [[design of experiments]]. Experimental designs were also studied with [[affine geometry]] over [[finite fields]] and then with the introduction of [[association scheme]]s by [[R. C. Bose]]. [[Orthogonal array]]s were introduced by [[C. R. Rao]] also for experimental designs.

===Algebraic analysis and abstract statistical inference===
[[Haar measure|Invariant measures]] on [[locally compact group]]s  have long been used in [[statistical theory]], particularly in [[multivariate analysis]]. [[Arne Beurling|Beurling]]'s [[invariant subspace|factorization theorem]] and much of the work on (abstract) [[harmonic analysis]] sought better understanding of the [[Wold's theorem|Wold]] [[Wold decomposition|decomposition]] of [[stationary stochastic process]]es, which is important in [[time series]] statistics.

Encompassing previous results on probability theory on algebraic structures, [[Ulf Grenander]] developed a theory of "abstract inference".  Grenander's abstract inference and his [[Pattern theory|theory of patterns]] are useful for [[spatial statistics]] and [[image analysis]]; these theories rely on [[lattice theory]].

===Partially ordered sets and lattices===
[[Ordered vector space|Partially ordered vector space]]s and [[Riesz space|vector lattices]] are used throughout statistical theory. [[Garrett Birkhoff]] metrized the positive cone using [[Hilbert metric|Hilbert's projective metric]] and proved [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|Jentsch's theorem]] using the [[contraction mapping]] [[contraction mapping theorem|theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;A gap in [[Garrett Birkhoff]]'s original proof was filled by [[Alexander Ostrowski]].
* [[Garrett Birkhoff]], 1967. ''Lattice Theory'', 3rd ed. Vol. 25 of AMS Colloquium Publications. [[American Mathematical Society]].
&lt;/ref&gt; Birkhoff's results have been used for [[Principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy]] [[estimation]] (which can be viewed as [[linear programming]] in [[infinite dimensional optimization|infinite dimensions]]) by [[Jonathan Borwein]] and colleagues.

[[Riesz space|Vector lattice]]s and [[Riesz space|conical measure]]s were introduced into [[statistical decision theory]] by [[Lucien Le Cam]].

==Recent work using commutative algebra and algebraic geometry==
In recent years, the term "algebraic statistics" has been used more restrictively, to label the use of [[algebraic geometry]] and [[commutative algebra]] to study problems related to [[discrete random variable]]s with finite state spaces. Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry have applications in statistics because many commonly used classes of discrete random variables can be viewed as [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]].

===Introductory example===
Consider a [[random variable]] ''X'' which can take on the values 0, 1, 2. Such a variable is completely characterized by the three probabilities 
:&lt;math&gt;p_i=\mathrm{Pr}(X=i),\quad i=0,1,2&lt;/math&gt;

and these numbers satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^2 p_i = 1 \quad \mbox{and}\quad 0\leq p_i \leq 1.&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, any three such numbers unambiguously specify a random variable, so we can identify the random variable ''X'' with the tuple (''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)∈'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Now suppose ''X'' is a [[binomial random variable]] with parameter ''q'' and ''n = 2'', i.e. ''X'' represents the number of successes when repeating a certain experiment two times, where each experiment has an individual success probability of ''q''. Then 
:&lt;math&gt;p_i=\mathrm{Pr}(X=i)={2 \choose i}q^i (1-q)^{2-i}&lt;/math&gt;
and it is not hard to show that the tuples (''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which arise in this way are precisely the ones satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;4 p_0 p_2-p_1^2=0.\ &lt;/math&gt;
The latter is a polynomial equation defining an algebraic variety (or surface) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and this variety, when intersected with the [[simplex]] given by
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^2 p_i = 1 \quad \mbox{and}\quad 0\leq p_i \leq 1,&lt;/math&gt;
yields a piece of an [[algebraic curve]] which may be identified with the set of all 3-state Bernoulli variables. Determining the parameter ''q'' amounts to locating one point on this curve; testing the hypothesis that a given variable ''X'' is Bernoulli amounts to testing whether a certain point lies on that curve or not.

==Application of algebraic geometry to statistical learning theory==
Algebraic geometry has also recently found applications to [[statistical learning theory]], including a [[Watanabe-Akaike information criterion|generalization]] of the [[Akaike information criterion]] to [[singular statistical model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://watanabe-www.math.dis.titech.ac.jp/users/swatanab/ag-slt-fig.html|title= Why algebraic geometry?|last=Watanabe|first=Sumio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Around the 1830s in Neuchâtel, Sonrel began creating scientific illustrations for Louis Agassiz. "Draftsmen of superior talent, trained ... to the greatest accuracy — Weber, Dinkel, and Sonrel — were constantly in [Agassiz's] employ at a regular salary. ... At the suggestion of Agassiz an extensive lithographic establishment was created in Neuchatel."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Guyot |title= Memoir of Louis Agassiz, 1807-1873 |work= Biographical Memoirs |publisher= National Academy of Sciences |orig-year= 1878 |year=1886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agassiz wrote in 1857: "I esteem myself happy to have been able to secure the continued assistance of my old friend, Mr. A. Sonrel, in drawing the zoological figures of my work. More than twenty years ago, he began to make illustrations for my European works ; and ever since he has been engaged, with short interruptions, in executing drawings for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Louis Agassiz |title= Contributions to the Natural Nistory of the United States of America |location= Boston |publisher= Little, Brown and Co. |year= 1862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Back to the Future''''' (also known as '''''Back to the Future: The Animated Series''''') is an American [[Animation|animated]] science fiction comedy adventure [[television series]] for television based on the live action [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' movie trilogy]]. The show lasted two seasons, each featuring 13 episodes, and ran on [[CBS]] from September 14, 1991, to December 26, 1992, and reran until August 14, 1993, on CBS. The network chose not to renew the show for a third season (citing low ratings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klastorin|first1=Michael|title=Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History|date=November 24, 2015|publisher=Harper Design|location=New York|isbn=0062419145|page=219|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It later reran on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], as a part of the [[4Kids TV|FoxBox]] block from March 22 to August 30, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/docs/news/2003-0313.pdf|title=4Kids Entertainment Adds Emmy Award Winning Show “Back To The Future” To Fox Box Lineup|publisher=www.4kidsentertainment.com|date=March 13, 2003|accessdate=August 28,  2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614222556/http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/docs/news/2003-0313.pdf|archivedate=June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the very first production of [[Universal Animation Studios|Universal Cartoon Studios]].

Although the cartoon takes place after the movies, [[Bob Gale]] has stated that the animated series and the comic books take place in their own 'what if' and alternate timelines and are not part of the main continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.telltalegames.com/community/blogs/id-687|title=

==Premise==
Following the conclusion of ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'', [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett L. Brown]] settled in 1991 in [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley]] with his new wife [[Clara Clayton|Clara]], their sons [[List of Back to the Future characters#Jules Brown|Jules]] and [[List of Back to the Future characters#Verne Brown|Verne]], and the family dog, [[Einstein (dog)|Einstein]], moved into a farm. As with the films, [[time travel]] was achieved through the use of a modified [[DeLorean DMC-12|DeLorean]], which had apparently been re-built after it was destroyed at the end of the trilogy. The DeLorean now has voice-activated "''[[time circuits]]''" and can also travel instantaneously to different locations in space and time, in addition to folding into a suitcase. The characters also traveled through time using the [[steam locomotive|steam engine]] time machine Doc invented at the end of the third film.

Although [[Marty McFly]] is the show's main character and [[Jennifer Parker]] making occasional appearances, the show focused primarily on the Brown family, whereas the movies focused on the McFly family. The film's villain, [[Biff Tannen]], also appeared frequently. In addition, relatives of McFly, Brown, and Tannen families were plentiful in the past or future parallel time zones visited. Unlike the films, which took place entirely in Hill Valley and the surrounding area, the series frequently took the characters to exotic locations. At the end of every episode, Doc Brown would appear to do an experiment, often related to the episode's plot. The first season also included post-credits segments with Biff Tannen telling a joke related to the episode, alluding to [[Thomas F. Wilson]]'s career as a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]].

==Intro==
The music for the intro is a re-created version of "[[Back in Time (Huey Lewis and the News song)|Back in Time]]", originally by [[Huey Lewis and the News]] (who also recorded "[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]" for the first film). The intro begins with Doc Brown surprised when seeing the time on his watch, before he enters the DeLorean. As he drives away, he heads to May 19, 2015 where he picks up Marty McFly, to June 10, 1885 to collect Clara, and to prehistoric times to grab Jules and Verne, before returning to 1991 (they escape from Griff Tannen, Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen and a Biff-like [[dinosaur]] respectively).

The following scene depicts the group sitting down to dinner, before noticing Einstein is missing. They subsequently find him driving the steam train time machine to an unknown time. For the second season, the intro replaces the collection of the main characters with clips of the first season and ends with the same sequence from season one's intro.

==Characters==
{{Main|List of Back to the Future characters}}
[[File:BTTFanimated.jpg|thumb|left|230px|From left to right: [[Einstein (Back to the Future)|Einstein]], [[Marty McFly|Marty]], [[Emmett Brown|Doc]], [[Minor characters in Back to the Future films#Verne Brown|Verne]], [[Clara Clayton|Clara]] and [[Minor characters in Back to the Future films#Jules Brown|Jules]].]]

* [[Marty McFly]] (voiced by [[David Kaufman (actor)|David Kaufman]]) – The main character of the series. Marty spends a lot of time visiting the Brown house where Doc, Clara, and their sons live. He continues to travel through time alongside Jennifer, Doc and the rest of the Brown family on many of their misadventures. Marty and Jennifer become students at Hill Valley College after graduating from Hill Valley High School.
* [[Jennifer Parker]] (voiced by [[Cathy Cavadini]]) – Marty's girlfriend.
* [[Emmett Brown|Emmett "Doc" Brown]] (portrayed by Christopher Lloyd in live action segments, voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] in the animated segments) – Marty's best friend and the inventor of the [[Time travel|time machine]], which he built out of a [[DeLorean DMC-12|DeLorean]] sports car in 1985 and later built a [[locomotive]] time machine from 1885 to 1895.  He lives with Clara and two sons Jules and Verne.
* [[Einstein (Back to the Future)|Einstein]] (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]) – The [[sheep dog]] living with Doc, Clara, Jules, and Verne. He is also Marty's friend.
*[[Clara Clayton|Clara Clayton Brown]] (voiced by [[Mary Steenburgen]]) – Doc's wife, who, along with the rest of the family, moved to the 20th century. She and the Browns lived in a farmhouse outside Hill Valley in 1991. Clara has settled well into 20th century life, and became a teacher at Hill Valley Elementary. She occasionally joins her husband, sons, and Marty on their time travel [[road trip]]s.
* [[Jules Brown]] (voiced by [[Josh Keaton]]) – Verne's elder brother. His middle name is Erastosthenes. Unlike younger brother Verne, Jules is intelligent for his age and, similarly to his father, uses long words in his everyday vocabulary. He calls Marty McFly "Martin". Jules is top of the class in his school; however, he is not very popular and has but a few friends. He has&lt;!-- Wikipedia is not a place for speculation: he is or he isn't --&gt; a crush on his classmate Franny Philips and enjoys [[baseball]] and inventing.
* [[Verne Brown]] (voiced by Troy Davidson) – Jules' younger brother. He is a cheeky young man; however, he hates losing and doing chores. He likes [[video games]] and watching television. He is almost always seen wearing a [[Coonskin cap|raccoon skin cap]]. Unlike his older brother Jules, Verne is quite popular at school and has many friends, including Marty McFly. He acts his age, unlike Jules. Verne often uses his favorite insult, "skunkhead", primarily toward his older brother. Verne also developed a rivalry with Biff Tannen's son, Biff Jr.
* [[Biff Tannen]] (voiced by [[Thomas F. Wilson]]) – Biff is the great-grandson of [[Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen]] and is the present day [[villain]] of the series, although most episodes feature his numerous ancestors or descendants instead (Marty once rhetorically questioned if there was a "Biff" in every time period and place they visited). In the series, Biff also has a son, Biff Jr. (voiced by [[Benji Gregory]]).

[[Mary Steenburgen]] ([[Clara Clayton Brown]]) and [[Thomas F. Wilson]] ([[Biff Tannen]]) voiced their characters from the films. [[Christopher Lloyd]] played [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown]] in the live-action segments which opened and closed each episode while [[Dan Castellaneta]] provided the animated Doc Brown's voice. [[James Tolkan]] was also featured as a guest voice in one episode, however he returned only to voice a completely different character as opposed to his Principal Strickland character from the films. In addition, [[Bill Nye]] appeared as Dr. Brown's Lab Assistant during the live-action segments at the end of each episode performing scientific experiments related to the episode. Nye also serves as the show's technical advisor. These segments later led to Nye getting his [[Bill Nye the Science Guy|own show]].

 |ShortSummary=In the first episode and [[series premiere]], Verne, upset with his brother, Jules, runs away from home using the [[DeLorean time machine|DeLorean]]. Doc, Marty and Jules use the Time Train to go back in time to find him. They find him during the [[American Civil War]] on February 11, 1864 in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. When General Beauregard Tannen's armies kidnap Marty, Verne gasps. Jules and Verne end up on opposite sides of the war; Verne is recruited by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] and Jules in the [[Union army]]. During a big battle, both armies see the boys meet and huddle together in the center of the battlefield. The soldiers realize that they are fighting their own [[brother]]s, [[cousin]]s, [[uncles]] and [[nephews]]. Both parties walk away from the battle without fighting, and they all chase after Doc, Marty, and the boys.

The episode reveals the origins of the word "butthead". General Tannen calls his troops "buttocks brains" and Verne corrects him to say "butthead".

 |ShortSummary=Without consulting the family while leaving Marty and Jennifer alone, Doc takes Clara and the boys back to medieval times to escape the technology that he feels his family has become so reliant upon. Leaving the DeLorean that goes back to their home turf, Doc angers Clara, and Jules and Verne leave them. Once there, Clara is kidnapped by the evil Lord Biffingham and Doc is thrown into the dungeon. Jules and Verne meet up with Harold McFly (Marty's ancestor), whose lady love, Jennivere (Jennifer's ancestor, almost), has also been kidnapped by Lord Biffingham. The boys and Harold arrive at the castle in time to witness a "jousting" match between the Lord and Doc. Clara escapes from the tower and makes a hot air balloon out of silk and a tapestry loom. As a true heroine, she rescues Doc and foils Biffingham's evil scheme. Doc realizes that he should consult her before making anymore decisions for the family. When Harold and Jennivere are together again, Doc, Clara, Jules, Verne, and Einstein head back in their home turf to visit Super Splash Water World, where Verne was expecting to go.

Despite the 'Complete Animated Series' having all episodes uncut, the first live-action segment of this episode is not shown.

 |ShortSummary=To test a new invention called the Sonic Garbage Molecular Redistributor, without Marty, Doc and the boys head back to [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]] before 3,000,000 years  so that they will not endanger anyone. Before they can run their test, a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' gives chase and with the help of a friendly ''[[Pteranodon]]'', they escape. At nighttime, they finally set up to run the test.

Using the locomotive, Marty and the boys go to find Doc and Clara; Marty needs Doc's help in fixing the hilarious affects of the hair cutting machine. Once there, P.T. Tannen (Buford's son) kidnaps Marty and displays him in a side-show as a "curiosity of nature". Doc, Clara and the boys save Marty and head home. Marty breaks his date with Liz (who has already found someone else, richest boy Milton Van Conrad the Third, to take her out) and apologizes to Jennifer for making fun of her hairdo. Jennifer and Marty then kiss.

 |ShortSummary=In the final episode and [[series finale]], Biff Jr. steals the arrowhead that Verne was going to use for his "Show and Tell", dooming Verne to have to be in the school play if he does not produce something to display. Verne grouses to his parents, who say that is not so bad and prohibit him from using the DeLorean to seek a quick fix, but Verne does an end run by being Marty's passenger in the DeLorean when Marty studies the age of dinosaurs. Not thinking about the ramifications, Verne takes a dinosaur egg back to 20th Century Hill Valley which then hatches into a brontosaurus. Verne, with the help of Jules and Marty, must hide the fast-growing dinosaur from his family and the rest of the town. The dinosaur is in danger when Biff and Biff Jr. capture it. They, in turn, sell it to Mr. Wisdom, who plans on dissecting poor "Tiny" and making lots of money. Marty and the entire Brown family save the baby dinosaur and reunite him with his mother in prehistoric times, but one of his baby teeth comes loose, to which Doc says Verne can use for Show &amp; Tell without raising suspicion.

==Home media releases==
Although the show no longer airs on television, nine [[VHS]] cassettes and three [[laserdisc]] volumes of the series were released from 1993 to 1994, chronicling 18 of the 26 episodes. The entire complete show was released on [[DVD]] on October 20, 2015 for the first time, both individually and as part of the ''Back to the Future: The Complete Adventures'' collection (which also includes all three movies of the trilogy).  In addition, the first episode from each season of the animated series (''Brothers'' and ''Mac the Black'') are included as bonus materials in the ''Back to the Future: 30th Anniversary Trilogy'' set.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|first=David|last=Lambert|url=http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Future-The-Complete-Animated-Series/21323|title=Back to the Future - 'Complete Animated Series' DVDs Date, Cost, Extras, Packaging|publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com|date=July 16, 2015|accessdate=November 5, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025025038/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Future-The-Complete-Animated-Series/21323|archivedate=October 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], more precisely in [[traditional grammar]], a '''cardinal number''' or '''cardinal numeral''' (or just '''cardinal''') is a [[part of speech]] used to [[Counting|count]], such as the [[English language|English]] words ''one'', ''two'', ''three'', but also [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]]s, e.g. ''three hundred and forty-two'' ([[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth English]]) or ''three hundred forty-two'' ([[American English]]). Cardinal numbers are classified as definite [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s and are related to [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]]s, such as ''first'', ''second'', ''third'', etc.&lt;ref name="Crystal2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David Crystal]]|title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-405-15296-9|edition=6th|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bussmann1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hadumo Bussmann|title=Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-20319-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hurford1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James R.

From a biological standpoint, the goal-directed molecular motions inside living cells are carried out by [[biopolymer]]s acting like molecular machines (e.g. [[myosin]], RNA/DNA polymerase, [[Ion pump (biology)|ion pumps]], etc.). These molecular machines are driven by '''conformons''', that is sequence-specific mechanical strains generated by free energy released in chemical reactions or stress induced destabilisations in supercoiled biopolymer chains. Therefore, conformons can be defined as packets of conformational energy generated from substrate binding or chemical reactions and confined within biopolymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Theory of the Living Cell - Springer|journal = Molecular Theory of the Living Cell: Concepts|last=Ji|first=Sungchul|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-2152-8|bibcode = 2012mtlc.book.....J|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-4614-2151-1|url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/1453271|format = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, from a physics standpoint, the conformon is a localization of elastic and electronic energy which may propagate in space with or without dissipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atanasov|first=Victor|last2=Dandoloff|first2=Rossen|title=Quantum-elastic bump on a surface|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0143-0807/38/i=1/a=015405?key=crossref.1c8a808e8c6ca8672e53732ec813d2f7|journal=European Journal of Physics|volume=38|issue=1|pages=015405|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/38/1/015405|arxiv=1402.2078|bibcode=2017EJPh...38a5405A|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism which involves dissipationless propagation is a form of molecular superconductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balakrishnan|first=Radha|last2=Dandoloff|first2=Rossen|date=2008-01-01|title=Effect of conformations on charge transport in a thin elastic tube|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0951-7715/21/i=1/a=001|journal=Nonlinearity|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1088/0951-7715/21/1/001|issn=0951-7715|arxiv=0803.3407|bibcode=2008Nonli..21....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; On quantum mechanical level both elastic/vibrational and electronic energy can be quantised, therefore the conformon carries a fixed portion of energy.

A '''consistent pricing process (CPP)''' is any representation of ([[frictionless market|frictionless]]) "prices" of assets in a market.  It is a [[stochastic process]] in a [[filtered probability space]] &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t=0}^T,P)&lt;/math&gt; such that at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; component can be thought of as a price for the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; asset.  

Mathematically, a CPP &lt;math&gt;Z = (Z_t)_{t=0}^T&lt;/math&gt; in a market with d-assets is an [[adapted process]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; if ''Z'' is a [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] with respect to the physical [[probability measure]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;Z_t \in K_t^+ \backslash \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; at all times &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K_t&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solvency cone]] for the market at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schachermayer|first=Walter|date=November 15, 2002|title=The Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing under Proportional Transaction Costs in Finite Discrete Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Markets with Transaction Costs: Mathematical Theory|author1=Yuri M. Kabanov|author2=Mher Safarian|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-3-540-68120-5|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPP plays the role of an [[equivalent martingale measure]] in markets with [[transaction costs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=No arbitrage and closure results for trading cones with transaction costs|first1=Saul|last1=Jacka|first2=Abdelkarem|last2=Berkaoui|first3=Jon|last3=Warren|journal=Finance and Stochastics|volume=12|issue=4 |pages=583–600|doi=10.1007/s00780-008-0075-7|year=2008|arxiv=math/0602178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there exists a [[One-to-one correspondence|1-to-1 correspondence]] between the CPP &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and the EMM &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

[[Image:CEV Lockheed Martin.jpg|thumb|'''CEV''' initial concept in Lockheed Martin design, showing delta-wing crew module (''at right''), with a mission module and propulsion stage (with rocket engines) for [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] flight.]]
[[File:File- Current 2009 Cev design.jpg|thumb|[[Orion (spacecraft)]], as a later design, after the initial plans for the Crew Exploration Vehicle led to development of the Orion.]]
The '''Crew Exploration Vehicle''' ('''CEV''') was the conceptual component of the U.S. [[NASA]] [[Vision for Space Exploration]] that later became known as the [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion]] spacecraft. The Orion CEV was part of NASA's [[Constellation Program]] to send human explorers back to the [[Moon]], and then onward to [[Mars]] and other destinations in the [[solar system]].

Official planning for the vehicle began in 2004, with the final [[RFP|Request For Proposal]] issued on March 1, 2005, to begin a design competition for the vehicle. For the later design and construction phases, see  [[Orion (spacecraft)]]. NASA has posted project status notes at the NASA.gov website, under the name "Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle" (see External links, below).

== Competition ==
The concept for the vehicle was officially announced in a speech given by [[George W. Bush]] at [[NASA Headquarters]] on January 14, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Final RFP was issued on March 1, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NASA|title=Crew Exploration Vehicle, Solicitation SOL NNT05AA01J|url=http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/sol.cgi?acqid=113638|date=2005-03-01|accessdate=2006-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117083711/http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/sol.cgi?acqid=113638|archivedate=2009-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the potential bidders being asked to answer by May 2, 2005. 

NASA had planned to have a suborbital or an Earth orbit fly-off called ''Flight Application of Spacecraft Technologies'' (FAST) between two teams' CEV designs before September 1, 2008. However, in order to permit an earlier date for the start of CEV operations, Administrator [[Michael D. Griffin]] had indicated that NASA would select one contractor for the CEV in 2006. From his perspective, this would both help eliminate the currently planned four-year gap between the retirement of the Shuttle in 2010 and the first manned flight of the CEV in 2014 (by allowing the CEV to fly earlier), and save over $1 billion for use in CEV development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/news/ap_050513_griffin_cev.html | title=NASA Chief Pushes for Shuttle's Replacement | last=Dunn | first=Marcia | publisher=[[Space.com]] | date=2006-05-13 | accessdate=2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2005, NASA announced the selection of two consortia, [[Lockheed Martin]] Corp. and the team of [[Northrop Grumman]] Corp. and The [[Boeing]] Co. for further CEV development work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NASA HQ|title=NASA Selects Contractors for Crew Exploration Vehicle Work|work=NASA Press Release 05-146|date=2005-06-13|url=http://www1.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/jun/HQ_05146_contractor.html|accessdate=2006-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827130557/http://www1.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/jun/HQ_05146_contractor.html|archivedate=2006-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team had received a US$28 million contract to come up with a complete design for the CEV and its launch vehicle until August 2006, when NASA would award one of them the task of building the CEV{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.  The teams would also have to develop a plan for their CEV to take part in the assembly of a lunar expedition, either with an [[Earth orbit rendezvous]], a [[lunar orbit rendezvous]], or with a [[direct ascent]]. The two teams were composed of:

*Northrop Grumman associated with Boeing as subcontractor for the Spiral One, [[Alcatel Alenia Space|Alenia Spazio]], ARES Corporation, [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory|Draper Laboratory]] and [[United Space Alliance]]
*Lockheed Martin associated with [[EADS SPACE Transportation]], [[United Space Alliance]], [[Aerojet]], [[Honeywell]], [[Orbital Sciences]], [[United Technologies Corporation|Hamilton Sundstrand]], and [[Wyle Laboratories]] (awarded the contract August 31, 2006).

Each contractor-led team included subcontractors that provided the lunar expedition astronauts with equipment, life support, rocket engines, and onboard navigation systems.  The planned orbital or suborbital fly-offs under FAST would have seen the competition of a CEV built by each team, or of a technology demonstrator incorporating CEV technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasawatch.com:16080/archives/cev_osp_sdlv_and_istp/ | title=Category: CEV, OSP, SDLV, and ISTP Archives | publisher=[[NASA Watch]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20051018064756/http://www.nasawatch.com:16080/archives/cev_osp_sdlv_and_istp/ | archivedate=2005-10-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under FAST, NASA would have chosen the winner to build the final CEV after actual demonstration of this hardware.  Fly-offs are often used by the U.S. Air Force to select military aircraft; NASA has never used this approach in awarding contracts.  However, as Administrator Griffin had indicated he would abandon the FAST approach, NASA pursued the more traditional approach of selecting a vehicle based on the contractors' proposals.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4133682.html | title=Astronaut lets name of new spaceship slip | last=Schneider | first=Mike | date=2006-08-26 | publisher=Houston Chronicle | accessdate=2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, 2006, NASA announced that the contract to design and develop the Orion was awarded to Lockheed Martin Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=NASA Selects Lockheed Martin To Be Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle Prime Contractor |publisher=NASA |date=2006-08-31 |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=20720 |accessdate=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bloomberg News]], five analysts it surveyed prior to the award announcement tipped the Northrop team to win.&lt;ref name="lococo20060831"&gt;{{cite web | first=Edmond | last=Lococo |author2=Demian McLean | title=Lockheed Beats Northrop for $3.9 Billion NASA Award (Update4) | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a4ycmHO6Fg7Y&amp;refer=home | publisher=Bloomberg News | date=2006-08-31 | accessdate=2006-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Caceres]], a space industry analyst with Teal Group, had projected that Lockheed would lose, partly because of Lockheed Martin's earlier failure on the $912 million [[X-33]] shuttle replacement program; after the contract award he suggested that Lockheed Martin's work on the X-33 gave it more recent research and development experience in propulsion and materials, which may have helped it win the contract.&lt;ref name="lococo20060831"/&gt; According to an Aerospace Daily &amp; Defense Report summary of a NASA document explaining the rationale for the contract award, the Lockheed Martin proposal won on the basis of a superior technical approach, lower and more realistic cost estimates, and exceptional performance on Phase I of the CEV program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Jefferson | last=Morris | title=CEV Decision Document Ranks LM Ahead In Mission Suitability, Cost, Past Performance | url=http://www.aviationnow.com/avnow/news/channel_aerospacedaily_story.jsp?id=news/LMCE09076.xml|work=Aerospace Daily &amp; Defense Report | date=2006-09-07 | accessdate=2006-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposals ==

=== Original designs ===
Lockheed's proposed craft was a small [[Space Shuttle]] shaped [[lifting body]] design big enough for six astronauts and their equipment. Its airplane-shaped design made it easier to navigate during high-speed returns to Earth than the capsule-shaped vehicles of the past, according to Lockheed Martin. According to the French daily ''[[Le Figaro]]'' and the publication ''[[Aviation Week and Space Technology]]'', EADS SPACE Transportation would be in charge of the design and construction of the associated ''Mission Module'' (MM). The head of the Lockheed team was [[Cleon Lacefield]]. 

The Lockheed Martin CEV design included several modules in the LEO (low earth orbit) and manned lunar versions of the spacecraft, plus an abort system. The abort system was an escape tower like that used in the Mercury, [[Project Apollo|Apollo]], Soyuz, and [[Shenzhou spacecraft|Shenzhou]] craft (Gemini, along with the Space Shuttles ''Enterprise'' and ''Columbia'' [until [[STS-4]]] used [[ejection seats]]). It would be capable of an abort during any part of the ascent phase of the mission. The crew would sit in the Rescue Module (RM) during launch. According to the publication ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'', the RM would have an outer heat shield of [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] and a redundant layer of felt reusable surface insulation underneath in case of RCC failure. The RM comprised the top half of the Crew Module (CM), which comprised the RM and the rest of the lifting-body structure. The CM included living space for four crew members. In an emergency the RM separates from the rest of the CM. The RM would seat up to six crew members, with two to a row, and the CM has living space and provisions for four [[astronauts]] for 5&amp;ndash;7 days. [[Extra-vehicular activity|Extra-Vehicular Activities]] (EVAs) could be conducted from the CM, which could land on land or water and could be reused 5&amp;ndash;10 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/nasa/new-space-shuttle?click=main_sr | title=Lockheed Unveils Shuttle Replacement - A PM Exclusive | publisher=Popular Mechanics| author=Coburn, Davin | date=1 June 2005 | accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission module would be added to the bottom of the CEV for a lunar mission, and would be able to hold extra consumables and provide extra space for a mission of lunar duration. It would also provide extra power and communications capabilities, and include a docking port for the [[Lunar Surface Access Module]] (LSAM). On the bottom of the lunar CEV stack would be the Propulsion or Trans-Earth Injection Module (TEIM) which would provide for return to the Earth from the Moon. It would probably incorporate (according to Aviation Week) 2 Pratt &amp; Whitney RL-10 engines. Together, the RM/CM, MM, and TEIM made up the Lockheed Martin lunar stack. The original idea was to launch the CM, MM, and TEIM on three separate [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]]s (EELVs), with one component in each launch. This vehicle would need additional modules to reach lunar orbit and to land on the Moon. However, this plan was to be altered according to the CFI (Call for Improvements), described below. 

Unlike the well-publicized Lockheed Martin CEV design, virtually no information was publicly available on the Boeing/Northrop Grumman CEV design. However, it is instructive to note that most publicly released Boeing designs for the canceled [[Orbital Space Plane]] (OSP)  resembled the Apollo capsule. It was possible that the Boeing CEV is a capsule rather than a lifting body or plane design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/php/multimedia/imagedisplay/img_display.php?pic=h_b_osp-capsule_reentry_02.jpg&amp;cap=An+artist%27s+rendition+of+an+Apollo-like+capsule+version+of+the+Orbital+Space+Plane+%28OSP%29+reenters+the+atmosphere.+This+Boeing-designed+OSP+will+seat+4+to+6+people+and+will+serve+as+a+crew+rescue+vehicle+and+crew+transfer+vehicle+for+the+International+Space+Station.+Initial+capability+of+the+OSP+System+to+take+on+these+duties+is+targeted+for+the+decade%27s+end.+CREDIT%3A+Boeing Image Display&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes to original bids ===
[[Image:Orion briefing model.jpg|thumb|NASA Constellation officials announcing the selected Orion contractor Aug. 31, 2006, at NASA Headquarters]]

[[Sean O'Keefe]]'s strategy{{when|date=October 2014}} would have seen the CEV development in two distinct phases. Phase I would have involved the design of the CEV and a demonstration by the potential contractors that they could safely and affordably develop the vehicle. Phase I would have run from bid submissions in 2005 to FAST (by Sept 2008) and downselect to one contractor. Phase II would have begun after FAST and involved final design and construction of the CEV. However, this schedule was unacceptably slow to Mike Griffin, and the plan was changed{{when|date=October 2014}} such that NASA will issue a "Call for Improvements" (CFI) after the release of the ESAS for Lockheed Martin and Boeing to submit Phase II proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://exploration.nasa.gov/acquisition/cev_procurement3_lite.html | title=Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Procurement | date=2005-05-16 | publisher=NASA | accessdate=2007-03-03 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403075851/http://exploration.nasa.gov/acquisition/cev_procurement3_lite.html | archivedate=2008-04-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA chose Lockheed Martin's consortium as the winning consortium on August 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/31/AR2006083101067.html | title=Lockheed Wins Contract to Build NASA's New Spaceship | last=Merle | first=Renae | date=2006-09-01 | publisher=The Washington Post | accessdate=2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the CEV bids submitted and described above are not necessarily representative of the final CEV design, as they will be changed in accordance with the CFI and any findings of the ESAS that are put into the CFI.

==Cause and effects of entertainment districts==
Entertainment districts have economically helped downtowns and cities thrive through development of various businesses that attract tourism and commerce. As entertainment districts tend to create crowds, facilitation and management by police is required to promote safety and regulation. The main source that requires police interaction in the entertainment districts are the nightclubs and bars that may promote intoxication and leads towards miscreant behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berkley|first1=Blair J.|last2=Thayer|first2=John R.|title=Policing Entertainment Districts|journal=Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies &amp; Management|date=2000|volume=23|issue=4|page=466-91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police and security deal with behavior consisting of bar fights, overcrowding, and public urination. The requirement of regulation and maintenance of these areas are important for the safety of the individuals utilizing and benefiting from the entertainment districts.

'''''Equinox''''' was a long-running [[Channel 4]] popular [[science]] and [[documentary film|documentary]] programme. The series ran from 31 July 1986 to 21 December 2006, originally airing on a weekly basis.

The number of films per series fell over the years, from eighteen one-hour films a year originally to twelve by the late 1990s. The last regular series was shown on 21 December 2006, with twelve films. One-off films have occasionally been aired under the title "''Equinox'' Special" (e.g. the 90-minute ''[[Secrets of the Super Psychics]]'' first transmitted in 1997).

==Notable episodes==

The '''European League of Stuttering Associations''' ('''ELSA''') was set up in 1990 by organisations in 12 countries to promote a greater knowledge and understanding of [[stuttering]] and to bring together, as a top [[umbrella organisation]], the national stuttering [[self-help]] organisations of [[Europe]].

ELSA is a trans-national, cross-cultural organisation. It seeks resources only open to multi-national groups, extends the exchange-of-information network, and lobbies for stutterers at a prominent international level.

Its main roles are:

* to link together and further the co-operation of Europe's national organisations.
* to provide a forum for exchange of concepts and experiences in stuttering therapy and self-help.
* to help represent the interests of stutterers to European and international bodies.
* to put stuttering onto the European agenda to ensure that the needs and challenges faced by people who stutter are considered in a European context.

ELSA's work has been recognised by the [[International Labour Office]] in Geneva, the [[World Health Organization]] in Geneva and the [[United Nations]] Office in Vienna. ELSA is also a founding member of the [[European Disability Forum]], an umbrella disability organisation based in [[Brussels]].

The "FSC" refers to ''[[Faint Source Catalogue]]'', one of the source catalogs produced by the [[IRAS]] infrared survey mission.  The emission is believed due to some combination of [[starburst region|starburst]] activity and accretion onto a super-massive [[black hole]], producing primary radiation at shorter wavelengths which is mostly blocked by obscuring dust, which is in turn heated and re-radiates in the [[infrared]].  The [[redshift]] of the source is ''z'' = 0.93, indicating a distance of the order of 7 billion light years.

'''Form classification''' is the classification of organisms based on their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], which does not necessarily reflect their biological relationships.  Form classification, generally restricted to [[palaeontology]], reflects uncertainty; the goal of science is to move "'''form taxa'''" to biological taxa whose affinity is known.&lt;ref name=Bengtson1985/&gt;

Form taxonomy is restricted to fossils that preserve too few characters for a conclusive taxonomic definition or assessment of their biological affinity, but whose study is made easier if a binomial name is available by which to identify them.&lt;ref name="Faegri1963"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Faegri | first1 = K.| title = Organ and Form Genera: Significance and Nomenclatural Treatment | doi = 10.2307/1216676 | jstor = 1216676 | journal = Taxon | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–28 | month = | date =January 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "form classification" is preferred to "form taxonomy"; taxonomy suggests that the classification implies a biological affinity, whereas form classification is about giving a name to a group of morphologically-similar organisms that may not be related.&lt;ref name="Bengtson1985"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bengtson | first1 = S. | title = Taxonomy of Disarticulated Fossils | doi =  | jstor = 1304949 | journal = Journal of Paleontology | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = 1350–1358 | year = 1985 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "parataxon" (not to be confused with [[parataxonomy]]), or "sciotaxon" (Gr. "shadow taxon"), is a classification based on incomplete data: for instance, the larval stage of an organism that cannot be matched up with an adult.  It reflects a paucity of data that makes biological classification impossible.&lt;ref name=Bengtson1985/&gt;  A sciotaxon is defined as a taxon thought to be equivalent to a true taxon (orthotaxon), but whose identity cannot be established because the two candidate taxa are preserved in different ways and thus cannot be compared directly.&lt;ref name=Bengtson1985/&gt;

== Examples ==
=== In zoology ===
Form taxa are groupings that are based on common overall forms. Early attempts at classification of [[labyrinthodont]]s was based on skull shape (the heavily armoured skulls often being the only preserved part). The amount of convergent evolution in the many groups lead to a number of [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] taxa.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Watson, D. M. S. (1920): The Structure, Evolution and Origin of the Amphibia. The "Orders' Rachitomi and Stereospondyli. ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]]'', (series B), Vol. 209, pp. 1–73 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/92046 Article from JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Such groups are united by a common mode of life, often one that is [[generalist and specialist species|generalist]], in consequence acquiring generally similar body shapes by [[convergent evolution]]. [[Ediacaran biota]] — whether they are the precursors of the [[Cambrian explosion]] of the fossil record, or are unrelated to any modern phylum — can currently only be grouped in "form taxa". Other examples include the [[seabirds]] and the "[[Graculavidae]]". The latter were initially described as the earliest [[family (biology)|family]] of [[Neornithes]] but are nowadays recognized to unite a number of unrelated early neornithine lineages, several of which probably later gave rise to the "seabird" form taxon of today.

Fossil eggs are classified according to the parataxonomic system called [[Veterovata]]. There are three broad categories in the scheme, on the pattern of organismal phylogenetic classification, called oofamilies, oogenera and oospecies (collectively known as ootaxa). The names of oogenera and oofamilies conventionally contain the root "oolithus" meaning "stone egg", but this rule is not always followed. They are divided up into several basic types: Testudoid, Geckoid, Crocodiloid, Dinosauroid-spherulitic, Dinosauroid-prismatic, and Ornithoid.&lt;ref name="Mikhailov"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Konstantin E. Mikhailov, Emily S. Bray &amp; Karl E.

=== In botany ===
{{main|Paleobotany#Fossil-taxa}}
In [[paleobotany]], two terms were formerly used in the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|codes of nomenclature]], "form genera" and "organ genera", to mean groups of fossils of a particular part of a plant, such as a leaf or seed, whose parent plant is not known because the fossils were preserved unattached to the parent plant.&lt;ref name="Gee2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gee | first1 = C.

*leaf fossils generic names ending in ''-phyllum''
*fruit fossils generic names ending in ''-carpon'', ''-carpum'' or ''-carpus''
*pollen fossils generic names ending in ''-pollis'' or ''-pollenoides''.

== Casual use ==
"Form taxon" can more casually be used to describe a [[wastebasket taxon]]: either a taxon that is not a natural ([[monophyletic]]) group but united by shared [[plesiomorph]]ies, or a presumably artificial group of organisms whose true relationships are not known, being obscured by [[ecomorphological]] similarity.{{vn|date=January 2011}}  Well-known form taxa of this kind include "[[duck]]s", "[[fish]]", "[[reptile]]s" and "[[worm]]s".{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

'''Game studies''', or '''ludology''', is the study of games, the act of playing them, and the players and cultures surrounding them. It is a discipline of [[cultural studies]] that deals with all types of games throughout history. This field of research utilizes the tactics of, at least, [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and [[psychology]], while examining aspects of the [[Game design|design of the game]], the players in the game, and finally, the role the game plays in its society or culture. Game studies is oftentimes confused with the study of [[video games]], but this is only one area of focus; in reality game studies encompasses all types of gaming, including [[sport]]s, [[board game]]s, etc.

Before video games, game studies often only included anthropological work, studying the games of past societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Ludens|last=Huizinga|first=Johan|publisher=Tjeenk Willink &amp; zoon|year=1938|isbn=|location=Haarlem|pages=|oclc=962401170}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once video games were introduced and became mainstream, game studies were updated to perform sociological and psychological observations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designtoolbox.co.uk/strategies/three-genres-of-game-research/ |title=Three Genres of Game Research |last=Mayer |first=Richard  |date=29 May 2016 |website=Design ToolBox |access-date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to observe the effects of gaming on an individual, his or her interactions with society, and the way it could impact the world around us.

There are three main approaches to game studies: the '''[[social science]]''' approach asks itself how games affect people and uses tools such as surveys and controlled lab experiments. The '''[[humanities]]''' approach asks itself what meanings are expressed through games, and uses tools such as ethnography and patient observation. The '''industrial and engineering''' approach applies mostly to video games and less to games in general, and examines things such as computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and networking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konzack|first=Lars|date=2007|editor-last=Williams|editor-first=J. Patrick|editor2-last=Smith|editor2-first=Jonas Heide|title=Rhetorics of Computer and Video Game Research|url=|journal=The Players' Realm: Studies on the Culture of Video Games and gaming|volume=|pages=|doi=|isbn=9780786428328|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other media disciplines, such as [[television studies|television]] and [[film studies]], game studies often involves [[textual analysis]] and [[audience theory]].

==History==

It wasn’t until [[Irving Finkel]] organized a colloquium in 1990 that grew into the [[International Board Game Studies Association]], [[Gonzalo Frasca]] popularized the term ''ludology'' (from the Latin word for game, ludus) in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frasca|first=Gonzalo|date=1999|title=Ludology Meets Narratology: Similitude and Differences between (video)games and Narrative|url=http://www.ludology.org/articles/ludology.htm|journal=[[Parnasso]]|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the publication of the first issues of academic journals like ''Board Game Studies'' in 1998 and ''Game Studies'' in 2001, and the creation of the [[Digital Games Research Association]] in 2003, that scholars began to get the sense that the study of games could (and should) be considered a field in its own right. As a young field, it gathers scholars from different disciplines that had been broadly studying games, such as psychology, anthropology, economy, education, and sociology. The earliest known use of the term "ludology" occurred in 1982, in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]'s “Does Being Human Matter – On Some Interpretive Problems of Comparative Ludology.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jesperjuul.net/ludologist/2004/02/22/the-definitive-history-of-games-and-stories-ludology-and-narratology/|title=The definitive history of games and stories, ludology and narratology|last=Juul|first=Jesper|date=2004-02-22|work=The Ludologist|access-date=2018-03-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social science==

One of the earliest social science theories (1971) about the role of video games in society involved [[violence]] in video games, later becoming known as the catharsis theory. The theory suggests that playing video games in which you perform violent acts might actually channel latent aggression, resulting in less aggression in the players real lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Television and Aggression; an Experimental Field Study|last=Feshbach|first=Seymour|last2=Singer|first2=Robert D.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1971|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=|oclc=941871879}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Meta-analysis|meta-study]] performed by Craig A. Anderson and Brad J. Bushman, in 2001, examined data starting from the 1980s up until the article was published.  The purpose of this study was to examine whether or not playing violent video games led to an increase in aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=C.

However, it has been pointed out, and even stressed, by psychologist Jonathan Freedman that this research was very limited and even problematic since overly strong claims were made and the authors themselves seemed extremely biased in their writings. More recent studies, such as the one performed by Christopher J. Ferguson at [[Texas A&amp;M International University]] have come to drastically different conclusions. In this study, individuals were either randomly assigned a game, or allowed to choose a game, in both the randomized and the choice conditions exposure to violent video games caused no difference in aggression. A later study (performed by the same people) looked for correlations between trait aggression, violent crimes, and exposure to both real life violence and violence in video games, this study suggests that while family violence and trait aggression are highly correlated with violent crime, exposure to video game violence was not a good predictor of violent crime, having little to no correlation, unless also paired with the above traits that had a much higher correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Rueda|first2=Stephanie M.|last3=Cruz|first3=Amanda M.|last4=Ferguson|first4=Diana E.|last5=Fritz|first5=Stacey|last6=Smith|first6=Shawn M.|displayauthors=1|date=|year=2008|title=Violent Video Games and Aggression: Causal Relationship or Byproduct of Family Violence and Intrinsic Violence Motivation?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093854807311719|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|volume=35|issue=3|pages=311–32|doi=10.1177/0093854807311719|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past 15 years, a large number of [[Meta-analysis|meta-studies]] have been applied to this issue, each coming to its own conclusion, resulting in little consensus in the ludology community. It is also thought that even nonviolent video games may lead to aggressive and violent behaviour. Anderson and Dill seem to believe that it may be due to the frustration of playing video games that could in turn result in violent, aggressive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=C.A.|last2=Dill|first2=K.E.|date=2000|title=Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviour in the laboratory and in life|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=4|pages=772–790|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.4.772|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game designers [[Amy Jo Kim]] and [[Jane McGonigal]] have suggested that platforms which leverage the powerful qualities of video games in non-game contexts can maximize learning.&lt;ref name="AmyJo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/amyjokim/smart-gamification|title=Smart Gamification|last=Kim|first=Amy Jo|date=1 August 2011|website=SlideShare|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reality is broken: Why games make us better and how they can change the world|last=McGonigal|first=Jane|publisher=Penguin|year=2011|isbn=9780099540281|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[gamification of learning]], using game elements in non-game contexts extracts the properties of games from within the game context, and applies them to a learning context such as the classroom.

Another positive aspect of video games is its conducive character towards the involvement of a person in other cultural activities. The probability of game playing increases with the consumption of other cultural goods (e.g., listening to music or watching television) or active involvement in artistic activities (e.g., writing or visual arts production).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borowiecki|first=Karol J.|last2=Prieto-Rodriguez|first2=Juan|date=2015|title=Video Games Playing: A Substitute for Cultural Consumptions?|url=http://www.culturaleconomics.org/awp/AWP-07-2013.pdf|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|volume=39|issue=3|pages=239–58.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games by being complementary towards more traditional forms of cultural consumption, inhibit thus value from a cultural perspective.

More sociologically-informed research has sought to move away from simplistic ideas of gaming as either 'negative' or 'positive', but rather seeking to understand its role and location in the complexities of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Video Gamers|last=Crawford|first=Garry|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415563680|location=London|pages=|author-link=Garry Crawford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, it has been suggested{{By whom|date=March 2018}} that the very popular MMO ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' could be used to study the dissemination of infectious diseases because of the [[Corrupted Blood|accidental spread]] of a [[Bubonic plague|plague]]-like disease in the gameworld.

=="Ludology" vs "Narratology"==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}

A major focus in game studies is the debate surrounding [[narratology]] and ludology. Many ludologists believe that the two are unable to exist together,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesperjuul.net/thesis/|title=A clash between game and narrative|website=www.jesperjuul.net|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others believe that the two fields are similar but should be studied separately. Many narratologists believe that games should be looked at for their stories, like movies or novels. The ludological perspective says that games are not like these other mediums due to the fact that a player is actively taking part in the experience and should therefore be understood on their own terms. The idea that a videogame is "radically different to narratives as a [[cognitive]] and [[Communication|communicative]] structure"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aarseth|first1=Espen|date=|year=2001|title=Computer Game Studies, Year One|url=http://gamestudies.org/0101/editorial.html|journal=Game Studies|volume=1|issue=1|page=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led the development of new approaches to criticism that are focused on videogames as well as adapting, repurposing and proposing new ways of studying and theorizing about videogames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konzack|first=Lars|date=2002|title=Computer Game Criticism: A Method for Computer Game Analysis|url=http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/05164.32231.pdf|journal=CGDC Conference Proceedings|volume=|pages=89–100|via=DiGRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costikyan|first=Greg|date=2002|title=I Have No Words &amp; I Must Design: Toward a Critical Vocabulary for Games|url=http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/05164.51146.pdf|journal=CGDC Conference Proceedings|volume=|pages=9–34|via=DiGRA}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent approach towards game studies{{Which|date=March 2018}} starts with an analysis of interface structures and challenges the keyboard-mouse paradigm with what is called a "[[ludic interface]]".

Academics across both fields provide scholarly insight into the different sides of this debate. Gonzalo Frasca, a notable ludologist due to his many publications regarding game studies, argues that while games share many similar elements with narrative stories, that should not prevent games to be studied as games.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ludology.org/articles/ludology.htm|title=Ludology|website=www.ludology.org|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He seeks not "to replace the narratologic approach, but to complement it."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Jesper Juul (game researcher)|Jesper Juul]], another notable ludologist, argues for a stricter separation of ludology and narratology. Juul argues that games "for all practicality ''can not'' tell stories."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This argument holds that narratology and ludology cannot exist together because they are inherently different. Juul claims that the most significant difference between the two is that in a narrative, events "have to" follow each other, whereas in a game the player has control over what happens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Garry Crawford]] and Victoria K. Gosling argue in favor of narratives being an essential part of games as "it is impossible to isolate play from the social influences of everyday life, and in turn, play will have both intended and unintended consequences for the individual and society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Garry|last2=Gosling|first2=Victoria K.|date=2009|title=More than a game: sports-themed video games and player narratives|url=|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|volume=26|pages=50–66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Last of Us]]'' is a video game released in 2013 that has been referred to as a narrative "masterpiece."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/why-last-us-first-truly-mature-action-game-story/|title=Why The Last of Us is the first truly mature action game (and our Game of the Year)|work=gamesradar|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the narratology side of game studies argue that ''The Last of Us'' and similar games that have followed it and preceded it, serve as examples that games can in fact tell stories.

==Other areas of research==

As is common with most academic disciplines, there are a number of more specialized areas or sub-domains of study.

===Video game pre-history===
An emerging field of study looks at the "pre-history" of video games, suggesting that the origins of modern digital games lie in: [[fair]]ground attractions and [[sideshow]]s such as shooting games; early "[[Coney Island]]"-style pleasure parks with elements such as large [[roller-coaster]]s and "[[haunted house]]" simulations; nineteenth century landscape simulations such as [[diorama]]s, [[panorama]]s, [[planetarium]]s, and [[stereograph]]s; and [[amusement arcade]]s that had mechanical game machines and also [[peep-show]] film machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Virtual Art|last=Grau|first=Oliver|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-262-57223-1|location=|pages=|author-link=Oliver Grau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games and aging===
In light of [[population ageing]], there has been an interest into the use of games to improve the overall health and social connectedness of ageing players. For example, [[Adam Gazzaley]] and his team have designed [[NeuroRacer]] (a game that improves cognitive tasks outside of the game among its 60+ year old participants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazzaleylab.ucsf.edu/page74.html|title=NeuroRacer Study|author=Gazzaley|first=Adam|authorlink=Adam Gazzaley|date=4 September 2013|website=|publisher=Gazzaley Lab|location=[[University of California, San Francisco]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908124030/http://gazzaleylab.ucsf.edu/page74.html|archive-date=8 September 2013|accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while the [[AARP]] has organized a [[game jam]] to improve older people's social connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miamioh.edu/news/campus-news/2016/03/aarp-game-jam.html|title=AARP teams up with students designing games for 50 plus|last=Kissell|first=Margo|date=17 March 2016|website=Miami University|publisher=|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers such as Sarah Mosberg Iversen have argued that most of the academic work on games and ageing has been informed by notions of economical productivity,{{Sfn|Iversen|2014|p=}} while [[Bob De Schutter]] and Vero Vanden Abeele have suggested a game design approach that is not focused on age-related decline but instead is rooted in the positive aspects of older age.{{Sfn|De Schutter|Vanden Abeele|2015|p=}}

===Virtual economies in gaming===
{{main|Virtual economy}}

Massive multiplayer online games can give economists clues about the real world. Markets based on digital information can be fully tracked as they are used by players, and thus real problems in the economy, such as inflation, deflation and even recession. The solutions the game designers come up with can therefore be studied with full information, and experiments can be performed where the economy can be studied as a whole. These games allow the economists to be omniscient, they can find every piece of information they need to study the economy, while in the real world they have to work with presumptions.

Former Finance Minister of Greece and Valve's in-house economist [[Yanis Varoufakis]] studied ''[[EVE Online]]'' and argued that video game communities give economists a venue for experimenting and simulating the economies of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/09/28/the-economics-of-video-games/|title=The Economics of Video Games|last=Plumer|first=Brad|date=28 September 2012|website=The Washington Post|publisher=|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2014/05/07/a-multiplayer-game-environment|title='A Multiplayer Game Environment Is Actually a Dream Come True for an Economist'|last=Suderman|first=Peter|date=June 2014|website=Reason|publisher=|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Castronova has studied virtual economies within a variety of games including Everquest and World of Warcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castronova|first=Edward|date=July 2002|title=On Virtual Economies|ssrn=338500|journal=CESifo Working Paper Series|language=|volume=752|pages=|via=SSRN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Synthetic worlds: the business and culture of online games|last=Edward.|first=Castronova,|date=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226096278|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=58648183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive Benefits ===
The psychological research into games has yielded theories on how playing video games may be advantageous for both children and for adults. Some theories claim that video games in fact help improve cognitive abilities rather than impede their development. These improvement theories include the improvement of visual contrast sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201502/cognitive-benefits-playing-video-games|title=Cognitive Benefits of Playing Video Games|last=Gray|first=Peter|date=20 February 2015|website=Psychology Today|language=|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other developments include the ability to locate something specific among various impediments. This is primarily done in first-person shooter games where the protagonist must look at everything in a first person view while playing. By doing this they increase their spatial attention due to having to locate something among an area of diversions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These games place the player in a high intensity environment where the player must remain observant of their surroundings in order to achieve their goal, e.g., shooting an enemy player, while impediments obstruct their gameplay in the virtual world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another cognitive enhancement provided by playing video games would be the improvement of brain functioning speed. This happens as the player is immersed in an unendingly changing environment where they are required to constantly think and problem solve while playing in order to do well in the game. This constant problem solving forces the brain to constantly run and so the speed of thought is sharpened greatly, because the need to think quickly is required to succeed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The attention span of the player is also benefited. High action video games, such as fighting or racing games, require the user’s constant attention and in the process the skill of concentration is sharpened.

The overcoming of the condition known as dyslexia is also considered an improvement due to the continuous utilization of controllers for the video games. This continuous process helps to train the users to overcome their condition which impedes in their abilities of interpretation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ability of hand-eye coordination is also improved thanks in part to video games, due to the need to operate the controller and view the screen displaying the content all at the same time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The coordination of the player is enhanced due the playing and continuous observation of a video game since the game gives high mental stimulation and coordination is important and therefore enhanced due to the constant visual and physical movement that is produced from the playing of the video game.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The playing of video games can also help increase a player's social skills. This is done by playing online multiplayer games which can require constant communication, this leads to socialization between players in order to achieve the goal within the game they may be playing. In addition it can help the users to meet new friends over their online games and at the same time communicate with friends they have already made in the past; those playing together online would only strengthen their already established bond through constant cooperation. Some video games are specifically designed to aid in learning, because of this another benefit of playing video games could be the educational value provided with the entertainment. Some video games present problem solving questions that the player must think on in order to properly solve, while action orientated video games require strategy in order to successfully complete. This process of being forced to think critically helps to sharpen the mind of the player.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granic|first=Isabela|last2=Lobel|first2=Adam|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger C. M. E.|date=2014|title=The Benefits of Playing Video Games|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-a0034857.pdf|journal=American Psychologist|volume=69|issue=1|pages=66–78|doi=10.1037/a0034857|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Game Culture'''

One aspect of game studies is the study of gaming culture. People who play video games are a subculture of their own. Gamers will often form communities with their own languages, attend conventions where they will dress up as their favorite characters, and have gaming competitions.  One of these conventions, Gamescon 2017, had a record attendance with over 350,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/gamescom-2017-worlds-biggest-video-game-convention-has-biggest-year-ever|title=Gamescom 2017: World's Biggest Video Game Convention Has Biggest Year Ever|last=Stewart|first=Sam|date=28 August 2017|website=IGN|language=|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1931) "Les Inégalités économiques", Paris, France, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Samuels|first=J.M.|jstor=2296055|title=Size and the Growth of Firms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law of proportionate growth gives rise to a distribution that is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]].&lt;ref name="Sutton1997"&gt;Sutton, J. (1997), "Gibrat's Legacy", ''Journal of Economic Literature'' XXXV, 40–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibrat's law is also applied to [[city|cities]] size and growth rate, where proportionate growth process may give rise to a distribution of city sizes that is log-normal, as predicted by Gibrat's law. While the city size distribution is often associated with [[Zipf's law]], this holds only in the upper tail, because empirically the tail of a log-normal distribution cannot be distinguished from Zipf's law. A study using administrative boundaries (places) to define cities finds that the entire distribution of cities, not just the largest ones, is log-normal.&lt;ref name="Eeckhout2004"&gt;Eeckhout J. (2004), Gibrat's law for (All) Cities. ''American Economic Review'' 94(5), 1429–1451.&lt;/ref&gt; But this last claim that the lognormal distribution cannot be rejected has been shown to be the result of a statistics with little power: the uniformly most powerful unbiased test comparing the lognormal to the power law shows unambiguously that the largest 1000 cities are distinctly in the power law regime.&lt;ref name="Malevergneetal2011"&gt;Y. Malevergne, V. Pisarenko and D. Sornette (2011), Testing the Pareto against the lognormal distributions with the uniformly most powerful unbiased test applied to the distribution of cities, "Physical Review E" 83, 036111.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has been argued that it is problematic to define cities through their fairly arbitrary legal boundaries (the places method treats Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts, as two separate units). A clustering method to construct cities from the bottom up by clustering populated areas obtained from high-resolution data finds a power-law distribution of city size consistent with Zipf's law in almost the entire range of sizes.&lt;ref name="Rozenfeld2011"&gt;Rozenfeld, Hernán D., Diego Rybski, Xavier Gabaix, and Hernán A. Makse. 2011. "The Area and Population of Cities: New Insights from a Different Perspective on Cities." American Economic Review, 101(5): 2205-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that populated areas are still aggregated rather than individual based. A new method based on individual street nodes for the clustering process leads to the concept of natural cities. It has been found that natural cities exhibit a striking Zipf's law &lt;ref name="Jiang2011"&gt;Jiang B, Jia T (2011),"Zipf's law for all the natural cities in the United States: a geospatial perspective", ''International Journal of Geographical Information Science'' 25(8), 1269-1281.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the clustering method allows for a direct assessment of Gibrat's law. It is found that the growth of agglomerations is not consistent with Gibrat's law: the mean and standard deviation of the growth rates of cities follows a power-law with the city size.&lt;ref name="Rozenfeld2008"&gt;Rozenfeld H, Rybski D, Andrade JS, Batty M, Stanley HE and Makse HA (2008), "Laws of Population Growth", ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 105, 18702–18707.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, processes characterized by Gibrat's law converge to a limiting distribution, often proposed to be the [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]], or a [[power law]], depending on more specific assumptions about the [[stochastic]] growth process. However, the tail of the lognormal may fall off too quickly, and its PDF is not monotonic, but rather has a Y-intercept of zero probability at the origin. The typical power law is the Pareto I, which has a tail that cannot model fall-off in the tail at large outcomes size, and which does not extend downwards to zero, but rather must be truncated at some positive minimum value. More recently, the Weibull distribution has been derived as the limiting distribution for Gibrat processes, by recognizing that (a) the increments of the growth process are not independent, but rather correlated, in magnitude, and (b) the increment magnitudes typically have monotonic PDFs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Englehardt|first=James D.|date=2015-06-10|title=Distributions of Autocorrelated First-Order Kinetic Outcomes: Illness Severity|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129042|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=6|pages=e0129042|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0129042|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Weibull PDF can appear essentially log-log linear over orders of magnitude ranging from zero, while eventually falling off at unreasonably large outcome sizes.

In the study of the [[business|firms]] (business), the scholars do not agree that the foundation and the outcome of Gibrat's law are empirically correct.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Scaling behaviour in the growth of companies|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v379/n6568/abs/379804a0.html|journal = Nature|date = 1996-02-29|pages = 804–806|volume = 379|issue = 6568|doi = 10.1038/379804a0|language = en|first = Michael H.

{{wikt|grex}}
[[File:Lycaste grex hera 1.jpg|thumb|× ''Lycamerlycaste'' Hera gx is a grex of orchid hybrids in the nothogenus × ''Lycamerlycaste'' J.M.H.Shaw. It consists of hybrids between members of a grex (× ''Lycamerlycaste'' Brugensis gx) and a species (''[[Lycaste cruenta]]'' Lindl.).]]
The term '''grex''' (pl. greges or grexes; abbreviation gx), derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] noun ''grex, gregis'' meaning 'flock', has been coined to expand [[botanical nomenclature]] to describe hybrids of [[orchids]], based solely on their parentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Brickell et al. 2009|loc=Article 4.1|ref=Brickell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grex names are one of the three categories of plant names governed by the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]; within a grex the ''[[cultivar group]]'' category can be used to refer to plants by their shared characteristics (rather than by their parentage), and individual orchid plants can be selected (and propagated) and named as [[cultivar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Brickell et al. 2009|p=x|ref=Brickell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hortax.org.uk/grex.html |title=HORTAX: Cultivated Plant Taxonomy Group |accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the name of a grex is first established, a description is required that specifies two particular parents, where each parent is specified either as a [[species]] (or [[nothospecies]]) or as a grex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Brickell et al. 2009|loc=Article 4|ref=Brickell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grex name then applies to all [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between those two parents. There is a permitted exception if the full name of one of the parents is known but the other is known only to genus level or nothogenus level.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Brickell et al. 2009|loc=Article 27.4|ref=Brickell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New grex names are now established by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]], which receives applications from orchid hybridizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Brickell et al. 2009|loc=Appendix 1|ref=Brickell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/plantsmanship/plant-registration/Orchid-hybrid-registration |title=Orchid hybrid registration |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botanical nomenclature of hybrids==
The horticultural nomenclature of grexes exists within the framework of the botanical nomenclature of hybrid plants. Interspecific hybrids occur in nature, and are treated under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] as [[nothospecies]], ('notho' indicating hybrid). They can optionally be given Linnean [[Binomial nomenclature|binomials]] with a multiplication sign "×" before the species epithet&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2012|loc=Article H1|ref=McNeill}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example ''Crataegus'' × ''media''.  An offspring of a nothospecies, either with a member of the same nothospecies or any of the parental species as the other parent, has the same nothospecific name. The nothospecific binomial is an alias for a list of the ancestral species, whether the ancestry is precisely known or not.

For example:
* a hybrid between ''[[Cattleya warscewiczii]]'' &lt;small&gt;Rchb.f. 1854&lt;/small&gt; and ''[[Cattleya aurea]]'' &lt;small&gt;Linden 1883&lt;/small&gt; can be called ''Cattleya'' × ''hardyana'' &lt;small&gt;Sander 1883&lt;/small&gt; or simply ''Cattleya hardyana''. An offspring of a ''Cattleya'' × ''hardyana'' [[Pollenizer|pollenized]] by another ''Cattleya'' × ''hardyana'' would also be called ''Cattleya'' × ''hardyana''.  ''Cattleya'' × ''hardyana'' would also be the name of an offspring of a ''Cattleya'' × ''hardyana'' pollenized by either a ''Cattleya warscewiczii'' or a ''Cattleya aurea'', or an offspring of either a ''Cattleya warscewiczii'' or a ''Cattleya aurea'' pollenized by a ''Cattleya'' × ''hardyana''.
* × ''[[Brassocattleya]]'' is a nothogenus including all hybrids between ''[[Brassavola]]'' and ''[[Cattleya]]''. It includes the species ''Brassocattleya'' × ''arauji'', also known simply as ''Brassocattleya arauji'', which includes all hybrids between ''[[Brassavola tuberculata]]''  and ''[[Cattleya forbesii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=24325 |title=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier term was '''nothomorph''' for subordinate taxa to nothospecies. Since the 1982 meeting of the [[International Botanical Congress]], such subordinate taxa are considered [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] (nothovars).

==Horticultural treatment of greges==
Because many interspecific (and even intergeneric) barriers to hybridization in the Orchidaceae are maintained in nature only by pollinator behavior, it is easy to produce complex interspecific and even intergeneric hybrid orchid seeds:  all it takes is a human motivated to use a toothpick, and proper care of the mother plant as it develops a seed pod. Germinating the seeds and growing them to maturity is more difficult, however.

When a hybrid cross is made, all of the seedlings grown from the resulting seed pod are considered to be in the same grex. Any additional plants produced from the hybridization of the same two parents (members of the same species or greges as the original parents) also belong to the grex. [[Reciprocal cross]]es are included within the same grex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Brickell et al. 2009|loc=Article 4 Note 2|ref=Brickell}}&lt;/ref&gt; If two members of the same grex produce offspring, the offspring receive the same grex name as the parents.

If a parent of a grex becomes a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]], any grex names that were established by specifying the synonym are not necessarily discarded; the grex name that was published first is used (the [[Principle of Priority]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Brickell et al. 2009|loc=Article 4.3|ref=Brickell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the members of a specific grex may be loosely thought of as "sister plants", and just like the brothers and sisters of any family, may share many traits or look quite different from one another. This is due to the randomization of genes passed on to progeny during [[sexual reproduction]]. The hybridizer who created a new grex normally chooses to register the grex with a registration authority, thus creating a new grex name, but there is no requirement to do this. Individual plants may be given [[cultivar]] names to distinguish them from siblings in their grex. Cultivar names are usually given to superior plants with the expectation of propagating that plant; all genetically identical copies of a plant, regardless of method of propagation (divisions or clones) share a cultivar name.

{{multiple image |direction=horizontal |header=Two named cultivars from the same grex |image1=Cymbidium Kirby Lesh 'Pink Ice'.jpg |caption1=''Cymbidium'' Kirby Lesh 'Pink Ice' |image2=Cymbidium Kirby Lesh 'Lonsdale'.jpg |caption2=''Cymbidium'' Kirby Lesh 'Lonsdale'}}
The grex name differs from a species name in that the gregaric part of the name is capitalized, is not italicized, and may consist of more than one word (limited to 30 characters in total, excluding spaces).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Brickell et al. 2009|loc=Article 21.13|ref=Brickell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:  an artificially produced hybrid between ''Cattleya warscewiczii'' and ''C.&amp;nbsp;dowiana'' (or ''C.&amp;nbsp;aurea'', which the RHS, the international orchid hybrid registration authority, considers to be a synonym of ''C. dowiana'') is called ''C.''&amp;nbsp;Hardyana&amp;nbsp;gx.  An artificially produced seedling that results from pollinating a ''C.''&amp;nbsp;Hardyana gx with another ''C.''&amp;nbsp;Hardyana gx is also a ''C.''&amp;nbsp;Hardyana gx.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  However, the hybrid produced between ''Cattleya''&amp;nbsp;Hardyana gx and ''C.&amp;nbsp;dowiana'' is not ''C.''&amp;nbsp;Hardyana gx, but ''C.''&amp;nbsp;Prince John gx. In summary:
*''C.''&amp;nbsp;Hardyana gx = ''C.&amp;nbsp;warscewiczii'' × ''C.&amp;nbsp;dowiana''
*''C.''&amp;nbsp;Eleanor gx = ''C.''&amp;nbsp;Hardyana gx × ''C.&amp;nbsp;warscewiczii'' 
*''C.''&amp;nbsp;Prince John gx = ''C.&amp;nbsp;dowiana'' × ''C.''&amp;nbsp;Hardyana gx

==Within nothospecies==
A grex and a nothospecies can have the same parentage, but are not equivalent because the nothospecies includes back-crosses and the grex does not.&lt;ref name=B1&gt;{{harv|Brickell et al. 2009|loc=Article 23.5|ref=Brickell}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can even have the same [[epithet]], distinguished by typography (see [[botanical name]] for explanation of epithets), although since January 2010 it is not permitted to publish such grex names if the nothospecies name already exists.&lt;ref name=B1/&gt;

Hybrids between a grex and a species/nothospecies are named as grexes, but this is not permitted if the nothospecies parent has the same parentage as the grex parent. That situation is a back-cross, and the nothospecies name is applied to the progeny.&lt;ref name=B1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="915">'''Ice VIII''' is a [[tetragonal]] crystalline form of [[ice]] formed from [[ice VII]] by cooling it below 5 °C. It is more ordered than ice VII, since the [[hydrogen]] atoms assume fixed positions.

Ordinary water ice is known as [[ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]], (in the [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Bridgman]] nomenclature). Different types of ice, from [[ice II]] to [[ice XVI]], have been created in the laboratory at different temperatures and pressures.

An approximate dating would be about 1880 to 1945. Considered to be at a peak in the time between the [[World War I|first]] and [[World War II|second]] world wars, it forms a late part of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The 1940s saw the beginning of the [[Atomic Age]], where [[modern physics]] saw new applications such as the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalcentury.com/1944.html&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[computer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/Articles/First-computer.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519100021/http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/Articles/First-computer.html |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[transistor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cedmagic.com/history/transistor-1947.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Digital Revolution]] ended the intellectual model of the machine age founded in the mechanical and heralding a new more complex model of [[high technology]].  The digital era has been called the [[The Second Machine Age|Second Machine Age]], with its increased focus on machines that do mental tasks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1832">'''Manus Trench''' is an [[oceanic trench]] in the [[Bismarck Sea]] north of [[Papua New Guinea]] delineating the [[plate tectonic]] boundary between the [[Caroline Plate|Caroline]] and [[North Bismarck Plate|North Bismarck]] plates.&lt;ref name="Treg-p6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tregoning|2002|loc=North Bismarck/Pacific Boundary, p. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There very moderate seismic activity along both these trenches, and their status as an active subduction zone has been challenged.  A relative motion of {{Convert|10|mm/yr|abbr=on|in/year}} or less has, nevertheless, been suggested for the Manus Trench, roughly normal to the trench.&lt;ref name="Treg-p6" /&gt;

The [[Kilinailai Trench|Kilinailau Trench]] east of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] forms the continuation to the Manus Trench and is thought to mark the boundary between the Pacific and North Bismarck plates.  It is, however, disputed whether the Caroline Plate moves independently from the Pacific Plate.  If not, the Manus and Kilinailau trenches form the Pacific-North Bismarck boundary together.&lt;ref name="Treg-p6" /&gt;

Perpendicular to the two trenches is another trench, the [[Mussau Trench]] separating the Caroline Plate and Pacific Plate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18752">A '''[[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] [[planning]] organization''' ('''MPO''') is a federally mandated and federally funded [[transportation]] policy-making organization in the [[United States]] that is made up of representatives from local [[government]] and governmental transportation authorities. They were created to ensure regional cooperation in transportation planning. MPOs were introduced by the [[Federal-Aid Highway Act|Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962]], which required the formation of an MPO for any [[urban area|urbanized area]] (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs in order to ensure that existing and future expenditures of governmental funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (“3&amp;#8209;C”) planning process. Statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes are governed by federal law ({{UnitedStatesCode|23|134|135}}). Transparency through public access to participation in the planning process and [[Internet|electronic publication]] of plans now is required by federal law. As of 2015, there are 408 MPOs in the United States.&lt;ref name="hepgislist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hepgis.fhwa.dot.gov/hepgismaps11/ViewMap.aspx?map=MPO+Boundaries%7CMPO+Boundary |title=MPO Boundary Data  |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Number of MPOs by state.png|thumb|Chart showing the number of Metropolitan Planning Organizations by state as of September 2015.]]

==Purpose==
Purposes of MPOs:{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* Transportation investment allocates scarce federal and other transportation funding resources;
* Planning needs to reflect the region’s shared vision for its future;
* Adequate transportation planning requires a comprehensive examination of the region’s future and investment alternatives; and
* An MPO acts as a Council of Governments; that is, it facilitates collaboration of governments, interested parties, and residents in the planning process.

In other words, the federal government requires that federal transportation funds be allocated to regions in a manner that has a basis in metropolitan  plans developed through intergovernmental collaboration, rational analysis, and consensus-based decision making.{{citation need|date=October 2017}}

==Governance==
Typically, an MPO [[governance]] structure includes a variety of committees as well as a professional staff. The “policy committee” is the top-level decision-making body for the planning organization. In most MPOs, the policy committee comprises:{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
*elected or appointed officials from local governmental jurisdictions such as [[municipalities]] or [[county|counties]];
*representatives of different transportation [[Transport mode|modes]], such as [[public transit]], [[freight]], [[bicycle]]/[[pedestrian]]; and
*state agency officials such as, state [[Department of Transportation]], environmental agency, etc.; and
*non-voting members such as [[Federal Highway Administration|FHWA]], [[Federal Transit Administration|FTA]], [[FAA]], [[Federal Railroad Administration|FRA]], staff advisers from state departments of transportation, [[Chambers of Commerce]]

With only a few unique exceptions nationwide (such as the [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|MPO in Portland, Oregon]]), MPO policy committee members are not elected directly by citizens. Rather, a policy committee member typically is an elected or appointed official of one of the MPO’s constituent local jurisdictions. The policy committee member thus has legal authority to speak and act on behalf of that jurisdiction in the MPO setting. Federal law, however, does not require members of an MPO policy committee to be representatives of the metropolitan areas' populations. Systematic studies have found that MPO policy committees' representations of urban municipalities and disadvantaged minority populations in their areas are less than proportional to population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Thomas W. Sanchez |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=January 2006 |title=An Inherent Bias? Geographic and Racial-Ethnic Patterns of Metropolitan Planning Organization Boards |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2006/06/01transportation-sanchez |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] Metropolitan Policy Program |series=Series on Transportation Reform |page= |docket= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy committee’s responsibilities include debating and making decisions on key MPO actions and issues, including adoption of the metropolitan long-range transportation plans, [[transportation improvement program]]s, annual planning work programs, budgets, and other policy documents. The policy committee also may play an active role in key decision points or milestones associated with MPO plans and studies, as well as conducting public hearings and meetings. An appointed advisory committee (CAC) develops the recommendations for consideration by the policy committee and establishes a ranked proposal for work plans.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Most MPOs also establish a technical committee to act as an advisory body to the policy committee for transportation issues that primarily are technical in nature. The technical committee interacts with the MPO’s professional staff on technical matters related to planning, analysis tasks, and projects. Through this work, the technical committee develops recommendations on projects and programs for policy committee consideration. Metropolitan travel forecasting is one of the key roles that the technical committee supports. The technical committee typically comprises staff-level officials of local, state, and federal agencies. In addition, a technical committee may include representatives of interest groups, various transportation modes, and local citizens. A 2005 survey of MPOs nationally commissioned in preparation of "Special Report&amp;nbsp;288" of the [[Transportation Research Board]] of the [[National Academies]] found that "forecast by negotiation" was a common method of projecting future population and employment growth for use in [[Transportation forecasting|travel forecasting]], suggesting [[rent-seeking]] behavior on the part of MPO committees influencing the technical staff.&lt;ref&gt;Committee for Determination of the State of the Practice in Metropolitan Area Travel Forecasting, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies. (2007) Metropolitan Travel Forecasting: Current Practice and Future Direction. Transportation Research Board Special Report 288. [http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/Metropolitan_Travel_Forecasting_Current_Practice_a_158933.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually MPOs retain a core professional staff in order to ensure the ability to carry out the required metropolitan planning process in an effective and expeditious manner. The size and qualifications of this staff may vary by MPO, since no two metropolitan areas have identical planning needs Most MPOs, however, require at least some staff dedicated solely to MPO process oversight and management because of the complexity of the process and need to ensure that requirements are properly addressed.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Functions==
===Core functions===

There are five core functions of an MPO:
#'''establish a setting''':  establish and manage a fair and impartial setting for effective regional decision-making in the metropolitan area (UZA)
# '''evaluate alternatives''':  evaluate transportation alternatives, scaled to the size and complexity of the region, to the nature of its transportation issues, and to the realistically available options
#'''maintain a [[regional transportation plan]] (RTP)''':  develop and update a fiscally constrained long-range transportation plan for the UZA covering a planning horizon of at least twenty years that fosters
#* mobility and access for people and goods,
#* efficient system performance and preservation, and
#* quality of life
# '''develop a [[transportation improvement program]] (TIP)''': develop a fiscally constrained program based on the long-range transportation plan and designed to serve the UZA’s goals while using spending, regulating, operating, management, and financial tools
#'''involve the public''': involve the general public and all the significantly affected sub-groups in the four essential functions listed above.

If the metropolitan area is designated as an [[air quality]] [[non-attainment area|non-attainment]] or maintenance area, then

#&lt;li value="6"&gt;'''protect air quality''': transportation plans, programs, and projects must conform with the air quality plan, known as the “[[State Implementation Plan|state implementation plan]]” (SIP), for the state within which the UZA lies.

Presently, most MPOs have no authority to raise revenues such as to levy taxes on their own, rather, they are designed to allow local officials to decide collaboratively how to spend available federal and other governmental transportation funds in their urbanized areas. The funding for the operations of an MPO comes from a combination of federal transportation funds and required matching funds from state and local governments.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Expanded functions===
In some regions, MPOs have been given authority to handle expanded functions:

* Managing a regional [[urban growth boundary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonmetro.gov/urban-growth-boundary|title=Urban growth boundary|author=|date=19 May 2014|website=oregonmetro.gov|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Distributing a Regional Housing Need Allocation to [[Smart growth|manage growth]] and ensure [[affordable housing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/planning/housingneeds/|title=ABAG Planning: Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA)|author=|date=|website=www.abag.ca.gov|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operating the region's [[public transportation]] services&lt;ref&gt;Governing Metropolitan Areas: Growth and Change in a Networked Age. David K. Hamilton, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of MPO organizations==
MPOs differ greatly in various parts of the country and even within states. Some have large staffs, while others may include only a director and a transportation planner. Sometimes the professional staff of an MPO is provided by a county or a council of governments. In many urban areas, existing organizations such as county governments or councils of government also function as MPOs. The MPO role also may be played by an independent governmental organization or a regional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bond|first=Alexander|title=Staffing and Administrative Capacity of Metropolitan Planning Organizations|url=http://www.cutr.usf.edu/programs/pcm/files/2010-05-Staffing_and_Administrative_Capacity_of_MPOs.pdf|work=Staffing and Administrative Structure of Metropolitan Planning Organizations|publisher=CUTR/FHWA|accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, for example, [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]] is the MPO. In the [[Minneapolis-St.&amp;nbsp;Paul, Minnesota]], metropolitan area, the [[Metropolitan Council]] is the MPO.

An example of a medium-sized MPO is the [[Lexington Area MPO]] in [[Kentucky]]. An example of a small MPO is the [[Kittery, Maine|Kittery Area MPO]] in [[Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smrpc.org/transportation|title=/kacts/kacts.htm smrpc.org|author=|date=|website=smrpc.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another MPO planning organization has developed in the area of western central [[Florida]]. Several MPOs there, with governance over eight counties, have developed a greater regional planning committee, the Chairs Coordinating Committee (CCC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionaltransportation.org/|title=Chairs Coordinating Committee|first=|last=Developer|date=|website=www.regionaltransportation.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; composed of the chairs of seven MPOs and the chairs of their appointed advisory committee (or their representatives) in order to coordinate transportation planning for the region, that is compatible with all, as well as addressing the challenges of long range planning for a large and growing region that has overlapping issues among the MPOs or transportation plans that extend throughout the entire area. Often the members of the executive committee of an MPO act interchangeably as the representative to this seven-MPO regional committee. This committee meets less frequently than the participating MPOs.

==Evolving role==
The enactment of the 1991 [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] (ISTEA) ushered in a “renaissance” for MPOs. After a decade or more of being consigned to a minimal role in transportation planning, ISTEA directed additional federal funding to MPOs, expanded their authority to select projects, and mandated new metropolitan planning initiatives. For the first time, state transportation officials were required to consult seriously with local representatives on MPO governing boards regarding matters of project prioritization and decision-making. These changes had their roots in the need to address increasingly difficult transportation problems&amp;mdash;in particular, the more complicated patterns of [[traffic congestion]] that arose with the [[suburban]] development boom in the previous decades. Many recognized that the problems could only be addressed effectively through a stronger federal commitment to regional planning.

The legislation that emerged, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), was signed into federal law by President [[George H.&amp;nbsp;W. Bush]] in December 1991. It focused on improving transportation, not as an end in itself, but as the means to achieve important national goals including economic progress, [[Air pollution|cleaner air]], [[energy conservation]], and [[social equity]]. ISTEA promoted a transportation system in which different modes and facilities&amp;mdash;highway, transit, [[pedestrian]], [[bicycle]], [[aviation]], and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]]&amp;mdash;were integrated to allow a "seamless" movement of both goods and people. New funding programs provided greater flexibility in the use of funds, particularly regarding using previously restricted highway funds for transit development,  improved "[[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]]" connections, and emphasized upgrades to existing facilities over building new capacity&amp;mdash;particularly roadway capacity.

To accomplish more serious metropolitan planning, ISTEA doubled federal funding for MPO operations and required the agencies to evaluate a variety of [[multimodal transport|multimodal]] solutions to roadway congestion and other transportation problems. MPOs also were required to broaden public participation in the planning process and to see that investment decisions contributed to meeting the air quality standards of the [[Clean Air Act Amendments]].

In addition, ISTEA placed a new requirement on MPOs to conduct “fiscally constrained planning”, and ensure that long-range transportation plans and short-term [[transportation improvement program]]s were fiscally constrained; in other words, adopted plans and programs can not include more projects than reasonably can be expected to be funded through existing or projected sources of revenues. This new requirement represented a major conceptual shift for many MPOs (and others in the planning community), since the imposition of fiscal discipline on plans now required, not only understanding how much money might be available, but how to prioritize investment needs and make difficult choices among competing needs. Adding to this complexity is the need to plan across transportation modes and develop approaches for multimodal investment prioritization and decision making. It is in this context of greater prominence, funding, and requirements that MPOs function today.

An annual element is composed of transportation improvement projects contained in an area's transportation improvement program (TIP), which is proposed for implementation during the current year. The annual element is submitted to the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Transportation]] as part of the required planning process.

The passage of Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users [[SAFETEA&amp;#8209;LU]] in 2005 created new and revised requirements for transportation planning and programs. Although SAFETEA-LU increased standards, most MPOs already were in compliance with the regulations. Some of the planning topic areas include transportation systems security, emergency preparedness, public participation plans for metropolitan planning, and requiring the [[Internet|electronic publication]] of plans and TIP/STIP by the MPOs.

SAFETEA-LU requires that the statewide transportation planning process and the metropolitan planning process provide for consideration of projects and strategies that will protect and enhance the environment, promote energy conservation, improve the quality of life, and promote consistency between transportation improvements and state and local planned growth and economic development patterns.&lt;ref&gt;49 USC 5303(g)(3) and 23 USC 134(g)(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Frontiers program website header, 2016.png|thumb|500px|right|Header of the New Frontiers program website, as of January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Frontiers Program Official Website (June 2016) |url=https://discoverynewfrontiers.nasa.gov/index.cfml |publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]] |date=January 15, 2016 |accessdate=January 15, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610145248/https://discoverynewfrontiers.nasa.gov/index.cfml |archivedate=June 10, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''New Frontiers program''' is [[List of NASA missions|a series of space exploration missions being conducted by NASA]] with the purpose of researching several of the [[Solar System]] bodies, including the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]].

NASA is encouraging both domestic and international [[scientist]]s to submit mission proposals for the program.&lt;ref name="six themes"/&gt; New Frontiers was built on the innovative approach used by the [[Discovery Program|Discovery]] and [[Explorer program|Explorer]] Programs of [[principal investigator]]-led missions. It is designed for medium-class missions that cannot be accomplished within the cost and time constraints of Discovery, but are not as large as [[Large Strategic Science Missions]] (Flagship misions). There are currently three New Frontiers missions in progress: ''[[New Horizons]]'', which was launched in 2006 and reached Pluto in 2015, ''[[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]'', which was launched in 2011 and entered Jupiter orbit in 2016, and ''[[OSIRIS-REx]]'', launched in September 2016 towards asteroid [[Bennu (asteroid)|Bennu]] for detailed studies from 2018 to 2021 and a sample return to Earth in 2023.

== History ==
[[File:Junoearthflyby.jpg|thumb|right|''Juno'' views Earth in October 2013 during the spacecraft's flyby en route to Jupiter]]
The New Frontiers program was developed and advocated by NASA and granted by Congress in CY 2002 and 2003. This effort was led by two long-time NASA executives at Headquarters at that time: [[Edward Weiler]], Associate Administrator of Science, and [[Colleen Hartman]], Solar System Exploration Division Director. The mission to Pluto had already been selected before this program was successfully endorsed and funded, so the mission to Pluto, called ''New Horizons'', was "grandfathered" into the New Frontiers program. The 2003 [[Planetary Science Decadal Survey]] from the National Academy of Sciences identified destinations that then served as the source of the first competition for the New Frontiers program. The program name was selected by Hartman based on President John F. Kennedy's speech in 1960, in which he said "We stand, today, on the edge of a New Frontier."

Examples of proposed mission concepts include two broad groups based on [[Planetary Science Decadal Survey]] goals.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;[http://discoverynewfrontiers.nasa.gov/program/index.cfml nasa nf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819021618/http://discoverynewfrontiers.nasa.gov/program/index.cfml |date=August 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|New Horizons}}
''[[New Horizons]]'', a mission to [[Pluto]], was launched on January 19, 2006. After a [[Jupiter]] [[gravity assist]] in February 2007 the spacecraft continued towards Pluto. The primary mission flyby occurred in July 2015 and the spacecraft was then targeted toward one [[Kuiper Belt]] object called {{mpl|486958|2014 MU|69}} for a January 1, 2019 flyby. Another mission that was considered with this mission was ''[[New Horizons 2]]''.

=== ''Juno'' (New Frontiers 2) ===
[[File:JUNO - PIA13746.jpg|thumb|Artists's concept of ''Juno'' at Jupiter]]
{{main|Juno (spacecraft)}}
''[[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]'' is a [[Jupiter]] exploration mission which launched on August 5, 2011 and arrived in July 2016. It is the first solar-powered spacecraft to explore an outer planet. The craft was placed into a [[polar orbit]] in order to study the planet's [[magnetic field]] and internal structure.
NASA's [[Galileo spacecraft|''Galileo'']] mission to Jupiter provided extensive knowledge about its upper atmosphere, however, further study of Jupiter is crucial not only to the understanding of its origin and nature of the Solar System, but also of giant [[extrasolar planet]]s in general. The ''Juno'' spacecraft investigation is intended to address the following objectives for Jupiter:
* Understand Jupiter's gross dynamical and structural properties through determination of the mass and size of Jupiter's core, its gravitational and magnetic fields, and internal convection;
* Measure the Jovian atmospheric composition, particularly the condensable-gas abundances (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), the Jovian atmospheric temperature profile, wind velocity profile, and cloud opacity to greater depths than achieved by the ''Galileo'' entry probe with a goal of 100 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] at multiple latitudes; and
* Investigate and characterize the three-dimensional structure of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere.

=== OSIRIS-REx (New Frontiers 3) ===
[[File:Osiris-rex-mission-logo12 copy.png|thumb|Mission logo]]
{{Main|OSIRIS-REx}}
''OSIRIS-REx'' stands for "Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer", and was launched on 8 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=NASA |title=NASA to Launch New Science Mission to Asteroid in 2016 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/osiris-rex.html |accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mission plan is to orbit an asteroid, at the time named {{mp|1999 RQ|36}} (now [[101955 Bennu]]), by 2020. After extensive measurements, the spacecraft will collect a sample from the asteroid's surface for return to Earth in 2023. The mission, excluding the launch vehicle, is expected to cost approximately $800 million. The returned sample will help scientists answer long-held questions about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|formation of the Solar System]] and the origin of complex [[organic molecule]]s necessary for the [[origin of life]].

Asteroid Bennu is a potential future Earth impactor and is listed on the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] with the third highest rating on the [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]] (circa 2015).&lt;ref name="risk-table"&gt;{{cite web |date=July 21, 2015 |title=Sentry Risk Table |publisher=NASA/[[JPL]] Near-Earth Object Program Office |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721210949/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/index.html |archivedate=July 21, 2015&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 2100s there is a cumulative chance of about 0.07% it could strike Earth, therefore there is a need to measure the composition and [[Yarkovsky effect]] of the asteroid.&lt;ref name="Milani et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milani |first=Andrea |display-authors=4 |last2=Chesley |first2=Steven R. |last3=Sansaturio |first3=Maria Eugenia |last4=Bernardi |first4=Fabrizio |last5=Valsecchi |first5=Giovanni B. |last6=Arratia |first6=Oscar |date=2009 |title=Long term impact risk for (101955) 1999 RQ&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=203 |issue=2 |pages=460–471 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2009.05.029 |bibcode=2009Icar..203..460M |arxiv=0901.3631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per recommendation by the Decadal Survey, NASA's announcement of opportunity was limited to six mission themes:&lt;ref name="NASA News 2017"/&gt;
# Comet Surface Sample Return - a [[comet nucleus]] lander and sample return mission
# Lunar South Pole Sample Return - a mission to land at the Moon's [[South Pole–Aitken basin]] and return samples to Earth
# Ocean Worlds (Titan and/or Enceladus)
# Saturn Probe - an atmospheric probe
# Trojan Tour and Rendezvous - a mission to fly by two or more [[Jupiter trojan|Trojan]] asteroids

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2826">In Canada, an '''official community plan''' is a comprehensive plan created by an incorporated [[municipality]] which dictates public policy in terms of transportation, utilities, land use, recreation, and housing. OCPs typically encompass large geographical areas, a broad range of topics, and cover a long-term time horizon. The process of creating an OCP is today often referred to as a Community Vision.

In the United States such a plan is known as a [[Comprehensive planning|comprehensive plan]].

In some large jurisdictions and metropolitan areas experiencing significant growth, regional [[Transportation planning|transportation plans]] are made that work in conjunction with municipal OCPS.

Official community plans is the formal term for documents created by an incorporated municipality and filed with the provincial government, usually the Ministry of Municipal Affairs.

OCPs have to be periodically updated to remain relevant. For example, the City of North Vancouver created an Official Community Plan in 1980, 1992, and again in 2002. When objectives of the plan have been achieved new objectives are set. For example, the [[North Vancouver, British Columbia (city)|City of North Vancouver]] in Metro Vancouver states as its achievements the construction of 5,000 units of housing in the city center, commercial and institutional development, a balanced mix of transportation modes, modern telecommunications infrastructure, a high percentage of multifamily housing, an accessible waterfront, and a balance between jobs and labour force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnv.org/c//DATA/2/107/~CHAPTER%2002%20INTRODUCTION%20TO%20THE%20OCP.PDF City of North Vancouver Official Community Plan 2002, Historical overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

Community planning may also be done on a smaller scale. The resulting plan is not an official community plan but is known as a [[Neighborhood Planning|neighborhood plan]]. In Vancouver such Neighborhood Plans are also known as ''community visions''. The primary motive for these neighborhood plans in Vancouver was to find ways to accommodate more housing (or new housing choices) in existing neighborhoods in a way sensitive and responsive to the concerns of existing residents. The official statement being more vague:&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/planning/cityplan/Visions/dunbar/vision.htm Report outlining the neighborhood planning process for Dunbar neighborhood in Vancouver]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"THAT Council and Departments use the ... Community vision directions to
help guide policy decisions, corporate work, priorities, budgets and capital plans in
this community."

''Langseth'' is intended primarily to collect [[reflection seismology|multichannel seismic]] data, including 3-D surveys.  The ship was purchased from the geophysical survey company [[WesternGeco]] in 2004, having previously been named ''[[M/V Western Legend]]''.

The ''Marcus Langseth'' was named for [[Marcus G. Langseth]], a Lamont scientist.

In March 2009 [[China|Chinese]] authorities denied the vessel permission to pass between [[Taiwan]] and China.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Logo seadatanet.PNG|thumb|Logo of '''SeaDataNet''' project]]
'''SeaDataNet''' is an international project of [[oceanography]]. Its main goal is to enable the scientific community to access historical datasets owned by national data centers.

== Description ==
This project aims to provide a web service permitting to retrieve validated datasets ([[temperature]], [[oxygen]], [[salinity]], [[nutrients]], etc.) from 45 different National Data Centers of 35 countries having coasts along European seas. Therefore SeaDataNet is a standardized system for managing the large and diverse data sets collected by the oceanographic fleets and the automatic observation systems. Additional objectives consist in creating product with aggregated data such as climatological descriptions. This European funded project has started in 2004, the project is currently in its second phase with fundings for 2012 to 2016. Most of the datasets are free of access, but some are restricted to institutes. 
In term of harmonization SeaDataNet has chosen standards, vocabularies, tools that are used in the different NODC(National Oceanographic Data Center). For example they use [[Ocean Data View]] to validate or visualize datasets, they also use [[DIVA software]] to perform [[objective analysis]]. Datasets are covering the years 1800 up to 2012. In 2012 400 data originators are registered into Seadatanet project.
[[File:SeaDataNet request.PNG|thumb|result of a request on datasets within SeaDataNet through Common Data Index web application]]

== Usage ==
Users of SeaDataNet who want to retrieve datasets coming from multiple Data Centers log to the Common Data Index&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seadatanet.org/Data-Access/Common-Data-Index-CDI&lt;/ref&gt; web-service to define their request. They can provide many details such as the type of platform wanted, the parameter wanted, the rate of sampling, the position, the originator country, etc. Then users send their request, the request is analysed and split into as much request as there are data centers concerned. At the end the user receive an email giving a FTP address where to retrieve all the data ordered in the file format wanted ([[ASCII]], [[NetCDF]] or [[Ocean Data View]] format).

'''[[Space warfare]]''' has served as a central theme within the [[science-fiction]] [[genre]]. One can trace its roots back to classical times, and to the "future war" novels of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Popular And The Canonical: Debating Twentieth-century Literature 1940&amp;ndash;2000|editor=David Johnson|year=2005|publisher=Routledge (UK)|author=Andrew M. Butler|chapter=Philip K. Dick. ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?''|isbn=0-415-35169-3|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interplanetary, or more often an [[interstellar war|interstellar or intergalactic war]], has become a staple [[plot device]] in [[space opera]]s. Space warfare has a predominant role in [[military science fiction]] but is not believed{{by whom|date=September 2014}} to be a realistic possibility because of the distances involved and the logistical impracticalities.&lt;ref&gt;

|author=Eugene F. Mallove and Gregory L. Matloff |publisher=Wiley
|date=June 1989|isbn=0-471-61912-4|pages=20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==

===Lucian===
In his second-century satire ''[[True History]]'', [[Lucian of Samosata]] depicts an imperial war between the king of the Sun and the king of the Moon over the right to colonise the [[Venus|Morning Star]]. It is the earliest known work of fiction to address the concept.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Roy Arthur"&gt;Swanson, Roy Arthur: [http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/10/swanson10art.htm “The True, the False, and the Truly False: Lucian’s Philosophical Science Fiction”], ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 3, No. 3 (Nov. 1976), pp. 227–239&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future war: the precursor to space warfare ===
The first "future war" story was [[George Tomkyns Chesney|George T. Chesney]]'s "The Battle of Dorking," a story about a British defeat after a German invasion of Britain, published in 1871 in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''. Many such stories were written prior to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. [[George Griffith]]'s ''[[The Angel of the Revolution]]'' (1892) featured self-styled "Terrorists" armed with then-nonexistent arms and armour such as airships, submarines, and high explosives. The inclusion of yet-nonexistent technology became a standard part of the genre. Griffith's last "future war" story was ''The Lord of Labour'', written in 1906 and published in 1911, which included such technology as disintegrator rays and missiles.&lt;ref name=Stableford&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction|editor=Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2003-12-08|isbn=0-521-01657-6|pages=20&amp;ndash;21|author=[[Brian Stableford]]|chapter=Science fiction before the genre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' inspired many other writers to write stories of [[Alien invasion|alien incursions]] and wars between Earth and other planets, and encouraged writers of "future war" fiction to employ wider settings than had been available for "naturalistic" fiction. Wells' several other "future war" stories included the atomic war novel ''[[The World Set Free]]'' (1914)&lt;ref name=Stableford /&gt; and "[[The Land Ironclads]]," which featured a prophetic description of the tank, albeit of an unfeasibly large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

accessdate=2007-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space opera ===
The modern form of space warfare in science fiction, in which mobile spaceships battle both planets and one another with destructive superweapons, appeared with the advent of [[space opera]]. Garrett P. Serviss' 1898 newspaper serial "[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]" was inspired by Wells and intended as a sequel to "Fighters from Mars," an un-authorized and heavily altered [[Edisonade]] version of ''The War of the Worlds''&lt;ref&gt;Edison Conquest of Mars, Introduction Robert Godwin, page 6, Apoge 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=November 2012}} in which the human race, led by [[Thomas Edison]], pursues the invading Martians back to their home planet. [[David Pringle]] considers Serviss' story to be the very first space opera, although the work most widely regarded as the first space opera is [[E. E. "Doc" Smith]]'s ''[[The Skylark of Space]]''. It and its three successor novels exemplify the present form of space warfare in science fiction, as giant spaceships employ great ray guns that send bolts of energy across space to shatter planets in a war between humans and alien species.&lt;ref name=Pringle&gt;{{cite book|title=Space and Beyond: The Frontier Theme in Science Fiction|editor=Gary Westfahl|publisher=Greenwood Press|date=2000-01-30|isbn=0-313-30846-2|pages=40&amp;ndash;41|author=David Pringle|chapter=What is this thing called space opera?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clareson&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Contemporary American Science Fiction: The Formative Period, (1926-1970)|author=Thomas D. Clareson|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|date=December 1992|isbn=0-87249-870-0|pages=17&amp;ndash;18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Weber]]'s ''[[Honorverse]]'' novels present a view of space warfare that simply transplants the naval warfare of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] and [[Horatio Hornblower]] into space. The [[space navy]] battle tactics in the Honorverse are much like those of Nelson, with the simple addition of a third dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Voyages and Visions: Towards a Cultural History of Travel|author=[[Jas Elsner]], Joan-Pau Ribiés|pages=264|year=1999|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1-86189-020-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late 20th century depictions ===
More recent depictions of space warfare departed from the [[jingoism]] of the [[pulp magazine|pulp science fiction]] of the 1930s and 1940s. [[Joe Haldeman]]'s ''[[The Forever War]]'', was partly a response to or a rebuttal of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', wherein space warfare involved the effects of [[time dilation]] and resulted in the alienation of the protagonists from the human civilization on whose behalf they were fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding contemporary American science fiction: the age of maturity, 1970-2000|author=Darren Harris-Fain|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=1-57003-585-7|pages=55&amp;ndash;57|chapter=After the New Wave, 1970&amp;ndash;1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Landon&gt;{{cite book|title=Science Fiction After 1900: From the Steam Man to the Stars|author=Brooks Landon|pages=70|year=2002|publisher=Routledge (UK)|chapter=From the Steam Man to the Stars|isbn=0-415-93888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=No explanation is given as to why Haldeman's novel is supposed to be a reaction or rebuttal to Heinlein's, or why the time dilation effect has anything to do with the main topic|date=September 2012}} Both novels have in the past been required reading at the [[United States Military Academy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Science fiction writers from the end of [[World War II]] onwards have examined the morality and consequences of space warfare. With Heinlein's ''Starship Troopers'' are [[A. E. van Vogt]]'s "War against the Rull" (1959) and [[Fredric Brown]]'s "Arena" (1944). Opposing them are [[Murray Leinster]]'s "First Contact" (1945), [[Barry Longyear]]'s "[[Enemy Mine (novella)|Enemy Mine]]," [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s "The Lucky Strike," [[Connie Willis]]' "Schwarzchild Radius," and [[John Kessel]]'s "Invaders."&lt;ref name=Landon /&gt;{{clarify|reason=Two opposing sides are given, but there's no mention of what either side stands for. Also, there are too many examples. Pick a couple from each side, and discuss why they are relevant|date=September 2012}} In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[Ender's Game]]'', the protagonist wages war remotely, with no realization that he is doing so.

Several writers in the 1980s were accused of writing fiction as part of a propaganda campaign in favour of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. [[Ben Bova]]'s 1985 novel ''Privateers'' has been given as an example.&lt;ref name=Landon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;{{cite book|title=War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination|author=H.

==Television and film==
{{Primary sources|section|date=February 2007}}
Early television productions such as ''[[Captain Video and His Video Rangers]]'' (1949) were severely constrained by the available [[special effect]]s technology, and effect sequences were typically difficult to set up. This, combined with the fact that early shows were often live productions, meant that space action sequences were usually short and simple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/captainvideo/captainvideo.htm|title=Captain Video and his Video Rangers|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production techniques improved throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and most programming moved to pre-recorded productions. This allowed more complex effects to be used, and increased the ability of producers to show action sequences such as space warfare. ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' is from this period. While the future presented in the original ''Star Trek'' series was not one of open warfare, the machinery of war was ever present, and was used in many episodes. Ships carried missiles armed with [[antimatter]] warheads, known as "[[Weapons in Star Trek#Photon torpedo|photon torpedoes]]", and [[Force shield|deflector shields]] for defense. Battles were shown on screen, but the expense and difficulty of advanced special effects meant that most battles were short and involved few craft. The costs of special effects dropped dramatically over the years, but remained high enough that larger battles showed relatively few ships firing and/or being hit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (1993) used computer graphics developed in part by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], and could show battles between numerous classes of ships using tactics developed by military strategists.

[[George Lucas]]' 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' broke new ground in its depiction of space warfare. Advances in technology, combined with the film's comparatively high budget, allowed Lucas to create long, complex space action sequences. The battle sequences were modeled after [[World War II]]-era [[dogfight]]ing from films such as ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'', and were a major milestone in fictional space combat. &lt;!-- to do: copy relevant sources from [[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]] to here --&gt;

A number of more ambitious films and television series soon followed, including ABC's ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (1978). ''Battlestar Galactica'' used expensive effects influenced by those of Lucas' film and followed his lead in concentrating on battles between [[Military spacecraft in fiction|starfighter]]s. It, and contemporary shows such as ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'', set new standards in television space battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/scienceficti/scienceficti.htm|title=Science Fiction Programs|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=2007-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series primarily used laser-type energy weapons in defense and offence on battleships,&lt;ref name="The Living Legend, Part 2"&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=List of Battlestar Galactica (1978, 1980) episodes#Battlestar_Galactica_.281978_TV_series.29 |title=The Living Legend, Part 2 |series=[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica 1978]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although analogues to ballistic weaponry are present in several episodes.&lt;ref name="Experiment in Terra"&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=Experiment in Terra|title=Experiment in Terra|series=[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica 1978]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 "re-imagining" of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' uses more conventional weaponry, such as guns and missiles mounted on the primary capital ships and starfighters, and use pure [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] to achieve a more realistic representation of how space warfare would actually appear.&lt;ref name="Miniseries"&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|title=Miniseries|series=[[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|Battlestar Galactica: The miniseries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- to do for this section: what happened between 1980 and 2003? --&gt;

[[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', the 1986 sequel to the 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', used ''Starship Troopers'' as the basis for its futuristic military.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The movie involves a small unit of the United States Colonial Marine Corps who provide emergency response to a planetary colony in 2179. The film showed futuristic twists on many modern types of military vehicle and gear, including a dropship, 10x25mm caseless "Pulse" M41A1 rifles, flamethrowers and machine guns, and realistic body armor and tactical equipment.

The 1993 television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' chronicled a turbulent time in galactic politics, which involved several inter-species wars. Political and humanitarian aspects were explored, such as atrocities against civilian populations, and [[telepathy]] was used as a weapon. The series made an attempt to faithfully depict the physics of combat in a vacuum, instead of using motion modelled on aeroplanes within our atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The 1995 American TV series ''[[Space: Above and Beyond]]'' centered around the "Wildcards", a group of marines in the 2060s who serve as both infantry and fighter pilots. The show attempted to depict technology that was near-future, but based on research. It also explored the alienation of deep space warfare, the horrors of loss and survival on the battefield, the bonds that form in combat, and a fight against an enemy of which they knew little. ''Space: Above and Beyond'' differs from many other military science fiction works in that its soldiers use weapons that fire bullets, and fight in space suits in alien environments.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The British TV series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', has numerous instances of this. ''[[Frontier in Space]]'', set in 2540, mentions a war between Earth and Draconia, fought 20 years earlier. This story involves renegade [[Time Lord]] the Master trying to start another war on behalf of the [[Dalek]]s, who plan to conquer the Galaxy. The [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] is a major plot point in the revived series, during which the [[Time Lord]]s, the species of the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]], fought the [[Dalek]]s. This war seems to have ended with the destruction of the Time Lord planet [[Gallifrey]], which the Doctor did hoping the Daleks would also be destroyed.

== Technology ==

===Weapons===
Usually, lasers are used rather than bullets. An August 1939 ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]'' issue consisted of an article written by [[Willy Ley]] claimed that bullets would be a more effective weapon in a real space battle.

===Destruction of planets and stars===
{{Main|List of planet killers}}
Destruction of planets and stars has been a frequently used aspect of interstellar warfare since the ''Lensman'' series.&lt;ref&gt;See (e.g.) E. E. "Doc" Smith (1951), ''Grey Lensman'', chapter 23&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2013}} This is not a realistic capability, as it has been calculated that a force on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s of energy, or roughly the total output of the [[sun]] in a week, would be required to overcome the gravity that  holds together an Earth-sized planet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karlscalculus.org/calc11_1.html#alderaan Uses the Death Star as an exercise in calculus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qntm.org/destroy A page on "How to Destroy the Earth."]&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of [[Alderaan]]  in ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' is estimated to require 1.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s of energy, millions of times more than would be necessary to break the planet apart at a slower rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theforce.net/swtc/ds/ Star Wars Technical Commentaries on the Death Stars]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128161919/http://www.theforce.net/swtc/ds/ |date=November 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval influences==
{{primary sources|date=September 2012}}
Fictional space warfare tends to borrow elements from naval warfare. [[David Weber]]'s Honorverse series of novels portrays several "[[space navy|space navies]]" such as the [[Royal Manticoran Navy]], which imitate themes from [[Napoleonic]]-era naval warfare.&lt;ref&gt;
''[[On Basilisk Station]]'' (© 1993 [[Mass market paperback]], © 1999 [[Hardcover]])&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2013}} &lt;ref&gt;''[[The Honor of the Queen]]'' ({{ISBN|0-671-57864-2}}, Copyright © 1993 by David Weber, First hardcover printing, March ©2000)&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2013}} &lt;ref&gt;''[[The Short Victorious War]]'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2013}} 
The [[Starfleet|Federation Starfleet]] (''Star Trek''), [[Imperial Navy (Star Wars)|Imperial Navy]] (''Star Wars'') Alliance Navy (''Mass Effect'') and [[Earthforce]] (''Babylon 5'')  also use a naval-style rank-structure and hierarchy. The former is based on the [[United States Navy]] and the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Okuda, Michael &amp; Denise (1997). [[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]. [[New York City]]: Pocket Books. {{ISBN|0-671-53607-9}}. Images accessible at 2265-2370 Ranks. Spike's Star Trek Page Rank Chart.
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Space Command]] in ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' fully echoes all ranks of the [[United States armed forces]], even [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|the pay-grade system]]. Naval ship-classes such as [[frigate]] or [[destroyer]] sometimes serve as marker to show how the craft are assembled and their designed purpose.

Some fictional universes have different implementations. The [[Colonial Forces (Battlestar Galactica)|Colonial Fleet]] in ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' uses a mixture of army and navy ranks, and the ''[[Stargate]]'' universe has military spacecraft under the control of modern [[air force]]s, and uses air-force ranks. In the ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' universe, officers of Systems Commonwealth ships follow naval ranking, but Lancers (soldiers analogous to Marines) use army ranks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19901">In [[mathematics]], a '''t-norm''' (also '''T-norm''' or, unabbreviated, '''triangular norm''') is a kind of [[binary operation]] used in the framework of [[probabilistic metric space]]s and in [[multi-valued logic]], specifically in [[fuzzy logic]]. A t-norm generalizes [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] in a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] and [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] in [[logic]]. The name ''triangular norm'' refers to the fact that in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces t-norms are used to generalize [[triangle inequality]] of ordinary [[metric space]]s.

== Definition ==

A t-norm is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] T: [0,&amp;nbsp;1] &amp;times; [0,&amp;nbsp;1] → [0,&amp;nbsp;1] which satisfies the following properties:
* [[Commutativity]]: T(''a'', ''b'') = T(''b'', ''a'')
* [[Monotonicity]]: T(''a'', ''b'') ≤ T(''c'', ''d'') if ''a'' ≤ ''c'' and ''b'' ≤ ''d''
* [[Associativity]]: T(''a'', T(''b'', ''c'')) = T(T(''a'', ''b''), ''c'')
* The number 1 acts as [[identity element]]: T(''a'', 1) = ''a''

Since a t-norm is a [[binary operation|binary algebraic operation]] on the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1], infix algebraic notation is also common, with the t-norm usually denoted by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.

The defining conditions of the t-norm are exactly those of the partially ordered Abelian monoid on the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. '' (Cf.&amp;nbsp;[[ordered group]].)'' The monoidal operation of any partially ordered Abelian monoid ''L'' is therefore by some authors called a ''triangular norm on L''.

=== Motivations and applications ===

T-norms are a generalization of the usual two-valued [[logical conjunction]], studied by classical logic, for [[fuzzy logic]]s. Indeed, the classical Boolean conjunction is both commutative and associative. The monotonicity property ensures that the [[degree of truth]] of conjunction does not decrease if the [[truth value]]s of conjuncts increase. The requirement that 1 be an identity element corresponds to the interpretation of 1 as ''true'' (and consequently 0 as ''false''). Continuity, which is often required from fuzzy conjunction as well, expresses the idea that, roughly speaking, very small changes in truth values of conjuncts should not macroscopically affect the truth value of their conjunction.

T-norms are also used to construct the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of [[fuzzy set]]s or as a basis for aggregation operators (see [[fuzzy set operations]]). In [[probabilistic metric space]]s, t-norms are used to generalize [[triangle inequality]] of ordinary metric spaces. Individual t-norms may of course frequently occur in further disciplines of mathematics, since the class contains many familiar functions.

=== Classification of t-norms ===

A t-norm is called ''continuous'' if it is [[continuous function|continuous]] as a function, in the usual interval topology on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. (Similarly for ''left-'' and ''right-continuity''.)

A t-norm is called ''strict'' if it is continuous and [[monotonic function|strictly monotone]].

A t-norm is called ''nilpotent'' if it is continuous and each ''x'' in the open interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1) is its [[nilpotent]] element, i.e., there is a natural number ''n'' such that ''x'' &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' (''n''&amp;nbsp;times) equals&amp;nbsp;0.

A t-norm &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is called ''Archimedean'' if it has the [[Archimedean property]], i.e., if for each ''x'', ''y'' in the open interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1) there is a natural number ''n'' such that ''x'' &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' (''n''&amp;nbsp;times) is less than or equal to ''y''.

The usual partial ordering of t-norms is pointwise, i.e.,
: T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp; if &amp;nbsp; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'') ≤ T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'') for all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].
As functions, pointwise larger t-norms are sometimes called ''stronger'' than those pointwise smaller. In the semantics of fuzzy logic, however, the larger a t-norm, the ''weaker'' (in terms of logical strength) conjunction it represents.

*'''Minimum t-norm''' &lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{min}}(a, b) = \min \{a, b\},&lt;/math&gt; also called the '''Gödel t-norm''', as it is the standard semantics for conjunction in [[Gödel fuzzy logic]]. Besides that, it occurs in most t-norm based fuzzy logics as the standard semantics for weak conjunction.

:is a strict Archimedean t-norm, and an important representative of the parametric classes of [[Construction of t-norms#Hamacher t-norms|Hamacher t-norms]] and [[Construction of t-norms#Schweizer–Sklar t-norms|Schweizer–Sklar t-norms]].

==Properties of t-norms==

The drastic t-norm is the pointwise smallest t-norm and the minimum is the pointwise largest t-norm:
:&lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b)  \le \top(a, b) \le \mathrm{\top_{min}}(a, b),&lt;/math&gt; for any t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; and all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

For every t-norm T, the number 0 acts as null element: T(''a'', 0) = 0 for all ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

A t-norm T has [[zero divisor]]s if and only if it has [[nilpotent element|nilpotent]] elements; each nilpotent element of T is also a zero divisor of T. The set of all nilpotent elements is an interval [0,&amp;nbsp;''a''] or [0,&amp;nbsp;''a''), for some ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

=== Properties of continuous t-norms ===

Although real functions of two variables can be continuous in each variable without being continuous on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, this is not the case with t-norms: a t-norm T is continuous if and only if it is continuous in one variable, i.e., if and only if the functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = T(''x'', ''y'') are continuous for each ''y'' in  [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Analogous theorems hold for left- and right-continuity of a t-norm.

A continuous t-norm is Archimedean if and only if 0 and 1 are its only [[idempotent]]s.

A continuous Archimedean t-norm is strict if 0 is its only [[nilpotent]] element; otherwise it is nilpotent. By definition, moreover, a continuous Archimedean t-norm T is nilpotent if and only if ''each'' ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1 is a nilpotent element of T. Thus with a continuous Archimedean t-norm T, either all or none of the elements of (0,&amp;nbsp;1) are nilpotent. If it is the case that all elements in (0,&amp;nbsp;1) are nilpotent, then the t-norm is isomorphic to the Łukasiewicz t-norm; i.e., there is a strictly increasing function ''f'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;\top(x,y) = f^{-1}(\top_{\mathrm{Luk}}(f(x), f(y))).&lt;/math&gt;
If on the other hand it is the case that there are no nilpotent elements of T, the t-norm is isomorphic to the product t-norm. In other words, all nilpotent t-norms are isomorphic, the Łukasiewicz t-norm being their prototypical representative; and all strict t-norms are isomorphic, with the product t-norm as their prototypical example. The Łukasiewicz t-norm is itself isomorphic to the product t-norm undercut at 0.25, i.e., to the function ''p''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') = max(0.25, ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;''y'') on [0.25,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For each continuous t-norm, the set of its idempotents is a closed subset of [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Its complement — the set of all elements which are not idempotent — is therefore a union of countably many non-overlapping open intervals. The restriction of the t-norm to any of these intervals (including its endpoints) is Archimedean, and thus isomorphic either to the Łukasiewicz t-norm or the product t-norm. For such ''x'', ''y'' that do not fall into the same open interval of non-idempotents, the t-norm evaluates to the minimum of ''x'' and ''y''. These conditions actually give a characterization of continuous t-norms, called the '''Mostert–Shields theorem''', since every continuous t-norm can in this way be decomposed, and the described construction always yields a continuous t-norm. The theorem can also be formulated as follows:
:A t-norm is continuous if and only if it is isomorphic to an [[Construction of t-norms#Ordinal sums|ordinal sum]] of the minimum, Łukasiewicz, and product t-norm.

A similar characterization theorem for non-continuous t-norms is not known (not even for left-continuous ones), only some non-exhaustive methods for the [[construction of t-norms]] have been found.

== Residuum ==

For any left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique binary operation &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; on [0,&amp;nbsp;1] such that
:&lt;math&gt;\top(z, x) \le y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;z \le (x \Rightarrow y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This operation is called the ''residuum'' of the t-norm. In prefix notation, the residuum to a t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\vec{\top}&lt;/math&gt; or by the letter R.

The interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] equipped with a t-norm and its residuum forms a [[residuated lattice]]. The relation between a t-norm T and its residuum R is an instance of [[adjoint functors#Posets|adjunction]] (specifically, a [[Galois connection]]): the residuum forms a right adjoint R(''x'', –) to the functor T(–, ''x'') for each ''x'' in the lattice [0,&amp;nbsp;1] taken as a [[poset]] category.

In the standard semantics of t-norm based fuzzy logics, where conjunction is interpreted by a t-norm, the residuum plays the role of implication (often called ''R-implication'').

=== Basic properties of residua ===

If &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is the residuum of a left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Rightarrow y) = \sup\{z\mid\top(z,x) \le y\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, for all ''x'', ''y'' in the unit interval,
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Rightarrow y) = 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(1 \Rightarrow y) = y.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is a left-continuous t-norm and &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; its residuum, then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
  \min(x,y)  &amp; \ge &amp; x * (x \Rightarrow y) \\
  \max(x, y) &amp; =   &amp; \min((x \Rightarrow y)\Rightarrow y, (y \Rightarrow x)\Rightarrow x).
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, then equality holds in the former.

=== Residua of prominent left-continuous t-norms ===

If ''x'' ≤ ''y'', then R(''x'', ''y'') = 1 for any residuum R. The following table therefore gives the values of prominent residua only for ''x'' &amp;gt; ''y''.

== T-conorms ==

'''T-conorms''' (also called '''S-norms''') are dual to t-norms under the order-reversing operation which assigns 1&amp;nbsp;– ''x'' to ''x'' on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Given a t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, the complementary conorm is defined by
: &lt;math&gt;\bot(a,b) = 1-\top(1-a, 1-b).&lt;/math&gt;
This generalizes [[De Morgan's laws]].

It follows that a t-conorm satisfies the following conditions, which can be used for an equivalent axiomatic definition of t-conorms independently of t-norms:
* Commutativity: ⊥(''a'', ''b'') = ⊥(''b'', ''a'')
* Monotonicity: ⊥(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ⊥(''c'', ''d'') if ''a'' ≤ ''c'' and ''b'' ≤ ''d''
* Associativity: ⊥(''a'', ⊥(''b'', ''c'')) = ⊥(⊥(''a'', ''b''), ''c'')
* Identity element: ⊥(''a'', 0) = ''a''

T-conorms are used to represent [[logical disjunction]] in [[fuzzy logic]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] in [[fuzzy set theory]].

===Examples of t-conorms===

Important t-conorms are those dual to prominent t-norms:

[[File:MaximumTconorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the maximum t-conorm (3D and contours)]]
*'''Maximum t-conorm''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{max}}(a, b) = \max \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt;, dual to the minimum t-norm, is the smallest t-conorm (see the [[#Properties of t-conorms|properties of t-conorms]] below). It is the standard semantics for disjunction in [[Gödel fuzzy logic]] and for weak disjunction in all t-norm based fuzzy logics.

[[File:ProbabilisticSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the probabilistic sum]]
*'''Probabilistic sum''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{sum}}(a, b) = a + b - a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; is dual to the product t-norm. In [[probability theory]] it expresses the probability of the union of independent [[event (probability theory)|event]]s. It is also the standard semantics for strong disjunction in such extensions of [[product fuzzy logic]] in which it is definable (e.g., those containing involutive negation).

[[File:BoundedSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the bounded sum t-conorm]]
*'''Bounded sum''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{Luk}}(a, b) = \min \{a+b, 1\}&lt;/math&gt; is dual to the Łukasiewicz t-norm. It is the standard semantics for strong disjunction in [[Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic]].

[[File:DrasticTconorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the drastic t-conorm. The function is discontinuous at the lines 1 &amp;gt; ''x'' = 0 and 1 &amp;gt; ''y'' = 0.]]
*'''Drastic t-conorm'''
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b) = \begin{cases}
  b &amp; \mbox{if }a=0 \\
  a &amp; \mbox{if }b=0 \\
  1 &amp; \mbox{otherwise,}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:dual to the drastic t-norm, is the largest t-conorm (see the [[#Properties of t-conorms|properties of t-conorms]] below).

[[File:NilpotentMaximum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the nilpotent maximum. The function is discontinuous at the line 0 &amp;lt; ''x'' = 1 – ''y'' &amp;lt; 1.]]
*'''Nilpotent maximum''', dual to the nilpotent minimum:
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{nM}}(a, b) = \begin{cases}
    \max(a,b) &amp; \mbox{if }a+b &lt; 1 \\
    1         &amp; \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:EinsteinSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the Einstein sum]]
*'''Einstein sum''' (compare the [[velocity-addition formula]] under special relativity)
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{H}_2}(a, b) = \frac{a+b}{1+ab}&lt;/math&gt;
:is a dual to one of the [[Construction of t-norms#Hamacher t-norms|Hamacher t-norms]].

===Properties of t-conorms===

Many properties of t-conorms can be obtained by dualizing the properties of t-norms, for example:
* For any t-conorm ⊥, the number 1 is an annihilating element: ⊥(''a'', 1) = 1, for any ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].
* Dually to t-norms, all t-conorms are bounded by the maximum and the drastic t-conorm:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\bot_{max}}(a, b) \le \bot(a, b) \le \bot_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;, for any t-conorm &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; and all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

Further properties result from the relationships between t-norms and t-conorms or their interplay with other operators, e.g.:
* A t-norm T [[distributivity|distributes]] over a t-conorm ⊥, i.e.,
::T(''x'', ⊥(''y'', ''z'')) = ⊥(T(''x'', ''y''), T(''x'', ''z'')) for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1],
:if and only if ⊥ is the maximum t-conorm. Dually, any t-conorm distributes over the minimum, but not over any other t-norm.

===Non-standard negators===

A '''negator''' &lt;math&gt;n:[0,1] \to [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Monotonic function#Monotonicity in functional analysis|monotonous]] falling, i. e. order-reversion mapping with &lt;math&gt;n(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n(1) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (in other notation: &lt;math&gt;0 \mapsto 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 \mapsto 0&lt;/math&gt;). 
A negator n is called
* '''strict''' in case of strict monotonocity 
* '''strong''' if it is strict and involutive (see: [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]): [[Universal quantification#notation|&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;]] &lt;math&gt;x \in [0,1]: n(n(x)) = x&lt;/math&gt;.
The standard (canonical) negator is 
&lt;math&gt;n(x) = 1 - x, x \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;, 
which appears to be strong. As the standard negator is used in the above definition of a t-norm/t-conorm pair, this can be generalized as follows:

A '''De Morgan Triplet''' is a triple (T,⊥,n) [[iff]] (if and only if)
# T is a t-norm
# ⊥ is a t-conorm according to the axiomatic definition of t-conorms as mentioned above
# n is a strong negator
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \in [0, 1]: \,n(\perp(a, b)) = T(n(a), n(b))&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must''''' is a nonfiction science book by [[Robert Zubrin]], first published in 1996, and revised and updated in 2011.

The book details Zubrin's [[Mars Direct]] plan to make the first [[human mission to Mars|human landing on Mars]]. The plan focuses on keeping costs down by making use of automated systems and available materials on Mars to manufacture the return journey's fuel ''[[in situ]]''.  The book also reveals possible [[Colonization of Mars|Mars colony]] designs and weighs the prospects for a colony's material self-sufficiency and for the [[terraforming of Mars]].

==Mars Direct==
{{Main article|Mars Direct}}

The '''Mars Direct''' plan was originally detailed by Zubrin and [[David Baker (biochemist)|David Baker]] in 1990. ''The Case for Mars'' is, according to Zubrin, a comprehensive condensation for laymen of many years' work and research. Chapters one and four deal with Mars Direct most completely.

==Colonization==
For [[Robert Zubrin]], the attractiveness of Mars Direct does not rest on a single cost-effective mission. He envisions a series of regular Martian missions with the ultimate goal of colonization, which he details in the seventh through ninth chapters. As initial explorers leave hab-structures on the planet, subsequent missions become easier to undertake.

Large subsurface, pressurized habitats would be the first step toward human settlement; the book suggests they can be built as [[Rome|Roman]]-style [[Atrium (architecture)|atria]] underground with easily produced Martian brick. During and after this initial phase of habitat construction, hard-plastic [[radiation]]- and abrasion-resistant [[geodesic]] domes could be deployed on the surface for eventual habitation and crop growth. Nascent industry would begin using indigenous resources: the manufacture of [[plastics]], [[ceramic]]s and [[glass]].

The larger work of [[terraforming]] requires an initial phase of [[global warming]] to release atmosphere from the [[regolith]] and to create a water-cycle. Three methods of global warming are described in the work and, Zubrin suggests, are probably best deployed in tandem: orbital mirrors to heat the surface; factories on the surface to pump [[halocarbons]] into the atmosphere; and the seeding of bacteria which can metabolize water, [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] to produce [[ammonia]] and [[methane]] (these would aid in global warming). While the work of warming Mars is on-going, true colonization can begin.

''The Case for Mars'' acknowledges that any Martian colony will be partially Earth-dependent for centuries. However, it suggests that Mars may be a profitable place for two reasons. First, it may contain concentrated supplies of [[metals]] of equal or greater value to [[silver]] which have not been subjected to millennia of human scavenging and may be sold on Earth for profit. Secondly, the concentration of [[deuterium]] – a possible fuel for commercial [[nuclear fusion]] – is five times greater on Mars. Humans emigrating to Mars thus have an assured industry and the planet will be a magnet for settlers as wage costs will be high. The book asserts that “the labor shortage that will prevail on Mars will drive Martian civilization toward both technological and social advances.”

==Wider considerations==
While detailing the exploration and colonization, ''The Case for Mars'' also addresses a number of attendant scientific and political factors.

===Risks confronted===
The fifth chapter analyzes various risks that putatively rule out a long-term human presence on Mars. Zubrin dismisses the idea that radiation and zero-gravity are unduly hazardous. He claims that [[cancer]] rates ''do'' increase for astronauts who have spent extensive time in space, but only marginally. Similarly, while zero-gravity presents challenges, “near total recovery of musculature and immune system occurs after reentry and reconditioning to a one-gravity environment.” Furthermore, since his plan has the spacecraft spinning at the end of a long tether to create artificial gravity, worries about zero gravity do not apply to this mission in any case. [[Back-contamination]] – humans acquiring and spreading Martian [[viruses]] – is described as "just plain nuts", because there are no host organisms on Mars for disease organisms to have evolved.

In the same chapter, Zubrin decisively denounces and rejects suggestions that the [[Moon]] should be used as waypoint to Mars or as a training area. It is ultimately much easier to journey to Mars from low Earth orbit than from the moon and using the latter as a staging point is a pointless diversion of resources. While the Moon may superficially appear a good place to perfect Mars exploration and habitation techniques, the two bodies are radically different. The moon has no atmosphere, no analogous [[geology]] and a much greater temperature range and rotational period. [[Antarctica]] or desert areas of Earth provide much better training grounds at lesser cost.

===Viability===
In the third and tenth chapters, ''The Case for Mars'' addresses the politics and costs of the ideas described. The authors argue that the colonization of Mars is a logical extension of the settlement of [[North America]]. They envision a frontier society, providing opportunities for innovation and social experimentation.

Zubrin suggests three models to provide the will and capital to drive Mars exploration forward: the [[John F. Kennedy|J.F.K]]. model, in which a far-sighted U.S. leader provides the funding and mobilizes national public opinion around the idea; the [[Carl Sagan|Sagan]] model, in which international co-operation is the driving force; and the [[Newt Gingrich|Gingrich]] approach, which emphasizes incentives and even prizes for private sector actors who take on research and development tasks. In keeping with the third idea, Zubrin describes twelve challenges that address various aspects of the exploration program. A monetary prize – from five hundred million to twenty billion dollars – is offered to companies who successfully complete the challenges.

The prize-based approach to hardware development has emerged within the private aeronautics community, though not yet on the scale envisioned by Zubrin. Ventures such as the [[Ansari X-Prize]] and [[Robert Bigelow|Robert Bigelow's]] [[America's Space Prize]] seek low-cost spaceflight development through private enterprise, and crucially, for the attainment of very specific predetermined goals in order to win the prizes.

The underlying political and economic problems of raising sufficient capital for terraforming using halocarbon emissions is critiqued by [http://jetpress.org/volume4/space.htm John Hickman].

==Translations==
In 2017, a Russian translation of the book was published under the title of ''Курс на Марс'' (''On Course for Mars'') ({{ISBN|978-5-699-75295-9}}).

'''''The Internet Galaxy: Reflections on the Internet, Business, and Society''''' is a book by [[Manuel Castells]], Professor of Sociology and Professor of City and Regional Planning at the University of California. It was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2001. The title is a reference to ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'', a 1962 book by [[Marshall McLuhan]]. It is regarded as a good introduction to [[Social informatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Social informatics is defined to be the body of research about information technologies in social contexts. Kling 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book contains 9 chapters. Castells starts with the history of Internet, focuses on the process of Internet evolution influence our society. He emphasizes the development of Internet from 1962 to 1995, the extension from [[ARPANET]] to [[WWW]].

Castells believes that "The openness of the Internet's architecture was the source of its main strength".&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; Then he states that the 'Internet Culture' is structured by four kinds of culture including: 'the techno-meritocratic culture', 'the [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] culture', 'the virtual communication culture', and 'the entrepreneurial culture'.&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, Castells analyses the vital status of Internet in the business and economy fields, and he refers to the impact of virtual communication which is based on the Internet communication to the reality in the following chapter. In terms of the Politics of the Internet, Castells points that 'social movement' and 'the political process' use Internet as a new communication medium to 'acting' and 'informing'. And there is an issue between 'Privacy and Liberty in Cyberspace' relates to 'the politics of the Internet' is mentioned in this book.

In the last three chapters, Castells analyses the Internet from [[multimedia]], geography and 'the digital divide in a global perspective'. Finally, he talks about the challenges of the network society such as freedom of the Internet.

==Opening: The Network is the Message==
&lt;!-- &lt;blockquote&gt;
"The elasticity of the [[Internet]] makes it particularly susceptible
to intensifying the contradictory trends present in our world.
Neither [[utopia]] nor [[dystopia]], the Internet is the expression
of ourselves — through a specific [[Code (communications)|code of communication]],
which we must understand if we want to change our reality."&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; --&gt;

The title used for the preface or introductory text is called "Opening" and the name given to this Opening is "The Network is the Message". It is a mimicry of [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s famous slogan "[[The medium is the message]]". By substituting ''network'' for ''medium'', Castells reinforces McLuhan's message that, in this case, it is the network which is important not the content.&lt;ref&gt;In this sense the network is just like the lightbulb. See the Heritage Minute on McLuhan.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening may then be seen to be an invitation to explore the meaning of network via the content of the book. The word network itself is of ambiguous interpretation: infrastructure or society?&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Weller's account on the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; Both interpretations are at play in the book. Since Castells is by profession a sociologist, then one expects a focus on network as society.

==Lessons from the History of the Internet==
&lt;!-- &lt;blockquote&gt;
"I use [[Libertarianism|″Libertarian″]] in the European sense, as a culture of liberty,
in the tradition of [[John Stuart Mill]], without prejudging the
tools by which liberty is achieved."&lt;ref&gt;Castells says that Libertarian has a different meaning in the European and in the American context. With respect to the latter, he claims that the name is understood to denote a political ideology that primarily means a systematic distrust of government.
Castells 2001, p33.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- The quotation chosen, comes from the note at the end of the chapter.--&gt;
Castells introduces the label [[Libertarianism|″Libertarian″]] to characterize all those who participated with "big science" and "military research" in bringing the Internet into being.&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p17&lt;/ref&gt;
The history of the Internet is diverse and well documented. Castells makes considerable use of John Naughton's text, "A Brief History of the Future", who noted for example that the Request for Comment Feature (RFC), introduced by Steve Crocker in 1969-04-07,&lt;ref&gt;This can be retrieved by typing 0001 into the box on the IETF RFC page.&lt;/ref&gt; not only gave rise to a de facto documenting of the research ideas at the time of their fermenting but also to the Open Source movement.&lt;ref&gt;Naughton 2000, p135-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Castells gives his own take on the subject. Ultimately, for him, the Internet is a cultural creation.

==The Culture of the Internet==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The culture of the Internet is a culture made up
of a technocratic belief in the progress of humans
through technology, enacted by [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|communities of hackers]]
thriving on free and open technological creativity,
embedded in [[Virtual communities|virtual networks]] aimed at reinventing
society, and materialized by money-driven entrepreneurs into
the workings of the new economy."&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p61.
It is important to note that Castells uses the term [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]]
in a very old and revered sense.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is important to take note of how Castells understands and uses the word Network.
For him, the network is a word that often has connotations of community. So, when he speaks of virtual networks he is '''not''' (necessarily) speaking of [[Virtual network|virtual networks in the technological sense]] but in the community sense of people networking.

==e-Business and the New Economy==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But markets also react to [[Macroeconomics|macro-economic conditions]], and to policy decisions—or to their anticipation. Or to the disparity between the anticipation and the actual event. Markets react as well on the basis of non-economic criteria. These are influenced by what I call ''information[[Turbulence]]s'' from various sources, such as political uncertainty... technological anticipations... or even personal moods or statements from key decision-makers..."&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p86. In the text (2001), Castells names Greenspan and Duisenberg as key decision-makers. For technological anticipations, he suggested the demise of the PC or the rise of the mobile internet. And the ellipsis in the quote covers the anti-trust law suit against Microsoft, at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Virtual Communities or Network Society?==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In contrast with the notorious cartoon published by
''The New Yorker'' in the pre-history of on-line communication,
on the Internet you better make sure
that everyone knows that you are a dog, and not a cat,
or you will find yourself immersed in the intimate world of cats.
Because on the Internet, you are what you say you are,
as it is on the basis of this expectation that a network
of social interaction is constructed over time."&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p130.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Politics of the Internet I: Computer Networks, Civil Society, and the State==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In this context [of a world dominated by homogeneous, global information flows], communication of values, mobilization around meaning, become fundamental. Cultural movements... are built around communication—essentially the Internet and the media... to affect the consciousness of society as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p140.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Networked Social Movements===
Castells shows how the Internet has been used for mobilizing people to support certain kinds of political, religious, or other social causes:&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p138-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

* the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]] in [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]]
* the [[Falun Gong|Falun Gong movement]], leader [[Li Hongzhi]] in [[New York City|New York]]
* the [[Direct Action Network]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]

==The Politics of the Internet II: Privacy and Liberty in Cyberspace==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Unless governments stop fearing their people, and therefore the Internet,
society will resort once again to the barricades to defend freedom and this will mark a stunning historical continuity."&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p185.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is that chapter of the book which one must read in the context of the pre-[[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] world.

===The End of Privacy===
Castells mentions a few official programs of governments:&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p176.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[ECHELON|Echelon program]] of the US/UK
* the [[Carnivore (software)|FBI Carnivore program]]
* the "[https://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/08/wiretap FBI Digital Storm]"&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Singel, "Point, Click ... Eavesdrop: How the FBI Wiretap Net Operates", Wired, 2007-08-29. See also [http://www.historycommons.org/searchResults.jsp?searchtext=Digital+Storm&amp;events=on&amp;entities=on&amp;articles=on&amp;topics=on&amp;timelines=on&amp;projects=on&amp;titles=on&amp;descriptions=on&amp;dosearch=on&amp;search=Go Digital Storm] on History Commons&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multimedia and the Internet: The Hypertext beyond Convergence==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Human culture only exists in and by human minds,
usually connected to human bodies.
Therefore, if our minds have the material capability
to access the whole realm of cultural expressions—select them,
recombine them—we do have a hypertext: the [[hypertext]] is inside us."&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p202.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Geography of the Internet: Networked Places==
[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Internet map by Matt Britt]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Cities are faced with a challenge... It follows that public space and monumentality (museums, cultural centers, public art, architectural icons) will play a key role in marking space, and facilitating meaningful interaction."&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p237&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are different ways in which to picture the geography of the Internet.
The picture of the graph on the cover of the book&lt;ref&gt;The graph was produced by [[William Cheswick]] and [[Hal Burch]]. Both Cheswick and Burch were at Bell Labs at the time. The map illustrates the topography of the Internet based on trace routes in January 2000. Castells 2001, p208.&lt;/ref&gt; resembles that of Matt Britt shown on the right.

==The Digital Divide in a Global Perspective==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Education, information, science, and technology
become the critical sources of value creation
in the Internet-based economy.
Educational, informational, and technological resources are
characterized by extremely uneven distribution throughout the world
(UNESCO, 1999)."&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p266.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conclusion: The Challenges of the Network Society==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I imagine one could say: ″Why don't you leave me alone?!
I want no part of your Internet, of your technological civilization, of your network society! I just want to live my life!″..."&lt;ref&gt;Castells 2001, p282.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==e-Links==
One of the significant features of the book (published in 2001 before
the [[September 11 attacks]] and around the time of the
[[dot-com bubble]]) is the
inclusion of the e-Links section at the end of every chapter. Each e-Link is given as a [[URL]], followed by a short text of one or two lines to describe the content. For example, at the end of Chapter 6 "The Politics of the Internet II: Privacy and Liberty in Cyberspace", a collection of 4 e-Links is given:
* cnetdownload.com
* junkbusters.com
* silentsurf.com
* anonymizer.com
and the short explanatory text following is "Websites providing technological resources to protect privacy."

There is one major flaw associated with the e-Links. None of the e-Links in ''The Internet Galaxy'' provide "the date of last access".

'''''The Making of the Atomic Bomb''''' is a [[contemporary history]] book written by the American journalist and historian [[Richard Rhodes]], first published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1987. It won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]],&lt;ref Name="Pulitzer"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Pulitzer Prize Winners: General Non-Fiction | publisher =pulitzer.org | url =http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/General-Nonfiction | accessdate =August 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]],&lt;ref name=nba1987&gt;[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1987 "National Book Awards – 1987"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved February 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[National Book Critics Circle Award]]. The narrative covers people and events from early 20th century discoveries leading to the science of [[nuclear fission]], through the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

Praised both by historians and former [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] weapon scientists, the book is considered a general authority on early [[nuclear weapon]]s history, as well as the development of modern physics in general, during the first half of the 20th century. Nobel Laureate [[I. I. Rabi]], one of the prime participants in the dawn of the atomic age, called it "an epic worthy of Milton. No where else have I seen the whole story put down with such elegance and gusto and in such revealing detail and simple language which carries the reader through wonderful and profound scientific discoveries and their application."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1451677618?showDetailProductDesc=1 The book's entry on Amazon.com] has this quote under "Editorial Reviews"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What Is This Thing Called Science?''''' is a  best-selling  textbook by [[Alan Chalmers]]. 

==Overview==
The book is a guide to the [[philosophy of science]] which outlines the shortcomings of naive empiricist accounts of science, and describes and assesses modern attempts to replace them.

A '''wireless mesh network''' ('''WMN''') is a [[Telecommunications network|communications network]] made up of [[radio]] [[Node (networking)|nodes]] organized in a [[Mesh networking|mesh]] [[Network topology|topology]]. It is also a form of [[wireless ad hoc network]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[Chai Keong Toh]]  Ad Hoc Mobile Wireless Networks, Prentice Hall Publishers, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-13-007817-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mesh''' refers to rich interconnection among devices or nodes. Wireless mesh networks often consist of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways. Mobility of nodes is less frequent. If nodes constantly or frequently move, the mesh spends more time updating routes than delivering data. In a wireless mesh network, topology tends to be more static, so that routes
computation can converge and delivery of data to their destinations can occur. Hence, this is 
a low-mobility centralized form of [[wireless ad hoc network]]. Also, because it sometimes 
relies on static nodes to act as gateways, it is not a truly all-wireless ad hoc network.

Mesh clients are often laptops, cell phones, and other wireless devices. Mesh routers forward traffic to and from the gateways, which may, but need not, be connected to the Internet. The coverage area of all radio nodes working as a single network is sometimes called a mesh cloud. Access to this mesh cloud depends on the radio nodes working together to create a radio network. A mesh network is reliable and offers redundancy. When one [[Mesh node|node]] can no longer operate, the rest of the nodes can still communicate with each other, directly or through one or more intermediate nodes. Wireless mesh networks can self form and self heal. Wireless mesh networks work with different wireless technologies including [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]], [[IEEE 802.15|802.15]], [[IEEE 802.16|802.16]], cellular technologies and need not be restricted to any one technology or protocol. See also [[mesh networking]].

==History==

===Architecture===
Wireless mesh architecture is a first step towards providing cost effective and low mobility over a specific coverage area. Wireless mesh infrastructure is, in effect, a network of routers minus the cabling between nodes. It is built of peer radio devices that do not have to be cabled to a wired port like traditional [[Wireless LAN|WLAN]] [[Wireless access point|access points (AP)]] do. Mesh infrastructure carries data over large distances by splitting the distance into a series of short hops. Intermediate nodes not only boost the signal, but cooperatively pass data from point A to point B by making forwarding decisions based on their knowledge of the network, i.e. perform routing by first deriving the topology of the network.

Wireless mesh networks is a relatively "stable-topology" network except for the occasional failure of nodes or addition of new nodes. The path of traffic, being aggregated from a large number of end users, changes infrequently. Practically all the traffic in an infrastructure mesh network is either forwarded to or from a gateway, while in [[wireless ad hoc networks]] or client mesh networks the traffic flows between arbitrary pairs of nodes.&lt;ref name="jun"&gt;J. Jun, M.L. Sichitiu, [http://networking.ncsu.edu/capacityWCM.pdf "The nominal capacity of wireless mesh networks"], in IEEE Wireless Communications, vol 10, 5 pp 8-14. October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

If rate of mobility among nodes are high, i.e., link breaks happen frequently, wireless mesh networks start to break down and have low communication performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wireless Communications, Networking and Applications: Proceedings of WCNA 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
This type of infrastructure can be decentralized (with no central server) or centrally managed (with a central server).&lt;ref name="chen"&gt;S.M. Chen, P, Lin, D-W Huang, S-R Yang, "A study on distributed/centralized scheduling for wireless mesh network" in Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, pp 599 - 604. Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Both are relatively inexpensive, and can be very reliable and resilient, as each [[node (networking)|node]] needs only transmit as far as the next node. Nodes act as [[Router (computing)|router]]s to transmit data from nearby nodes to [[peer-to-peer|peers]] that are too far away to reach in a single hop, resulting in a network that can span larger distances. The topology of a mesh network must be relatively stable, i.e., not too much mobility. If one node drops out of the network, due to hardware failure or any other reason, its neighbors can quickly find another route using a routing protocol.

===Applications===
Mesh networks may involve either fixed or mobile devices. The solutions are as diverse as communication needs, for example in difficult environments such as emergency situations, tunnels, oil rigs, battlefield surveillance, high-speed mobile-video applications on board public transport, real-time racing-car telemetry, or self-organizing Internet access for communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tO3dDYYXrpwC&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The First 100 Feet|last=Beyer|first=Dave|last2=Vestrich|first2=Mark|last3=Garcia-Luna-Aceves|first3=Jose|publisher=MIT Press|year=1999|isbn=0-262-58160-4|editor-last=Hurley|editor-first=D.|location=|pages=75-91|chapter=The Rooftop Community Network: Free High-Speed Network Access for Communities|editor-last2=Keller|editor-first2=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An important possible application for wireless mesh networks is VoIP. By using a quality of service scheme, the wireless mesh may support routing local telephone calls through the mesh. Most applications in wireless mesh networks are similar to those in [[wireless ad hoc networks]]. 

Some current applications:
* U.S. military forces are now using wireless [[mesh networking]] to connect their computers, mainly ruggedized laptops, in field operations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* '''Electric smart meters''' now being deployed on residences, transfer their readings from one to another and eventually to the central office for billing, without the need for human meter readers or the need to connect the meters with cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zigbee.org/Standards/ZigBeeSmartEnergy/Overview.aspx|title= ZigBee.org Smart Energy Overview.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The laptops in the [[One Laptop per Child]] program use wireless mesh networking to enable students to exchange files and get on the Internet even though they lack wired or cell phone or other physical connections in their area.
* '''Google Home''', Google Wi-Fi, and Google OnHub all support '''Wi-Fi mesh (i.e., Wi-Fi ad hoc) networking'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidcentral.com/how-wifi-mesh-networks-work?_ga=2.118951497.1982325821.1494489061-1333092243.1494489050 |title="Everyone is a node: How Wi-Fi Mesh Networking work by Jerry Hildenbrand, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several manufacturers of Wi-Fi routers began offering mesh routers for home use in the mid-2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3212444/wi-fi/mesh-network-explained.html|title=Wireless mesh networks: Everything you need to know|work=PCWorld|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 66-satellite [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium constellation]] operates as a mesh network, with wireless links between adjacent satellites. Calls between two satellite phones are routed through the mesh, from one satellite to another across the constellation, without having to go through an [[earth station]]. This makes for a smaller travel distance for the signal, reducing latency, and also allows for the constellation to operate with far fewer earth stations than would be required for 66 traditional communications satellites.

===Operation===
The principle is similar to the way [[Packet (information technology)|packet]]s travel around the wired [[Internet]]—data hops from one device to another until it eventually reaches its destination. Dynamic [[routing]] algorithms implemented in each device allow this to happen. To implement such dynamic routing protocols, each device needs to communicate routing information to other devices in the network. Each device then determines what to do with the data it receives – either pass it on to the next device or keep it, depending on the protocol. The routing [[algorithm]] used should attempt to always ensure that the data takes the most appropriate (fastest) route to its destination.

===Multi-radio mesh===
Multi-radio mesh refers to having different radios operating at different frequencies to interconnect nodes in a mesh. This means there is a unique frequency used for each wireless 
hop and thus a dedicated [[Carrier sense multiple access|CSMA]] [[collision domain]]. With
more radio bands, communication throughput is likely to increase as a result of more available
communication channels. This is similar to providing dual or multiple radio paths to transmit
and receive data.

===Research topics===
One of the more often cited papers on Wireless Mesh Networks identified the following areas as open research problems in 2005

* New modulation scheme
** To achieve higher transmission rate requires new wideband transmission schemes other than [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]] and [[Ultra-wideband|UWB]].
* Advanced antenna processing
** Advanced antenna processing including [[Directional antenna|directional]], [[smart antenna|smart]] and [[multiple antenna research|multiple antenna]] technologies is further investigated, since their complexity and cost are still too high for wide commercialization.
* Flexible [[spectrum management]]
** Tremendous efforts on research of frequency-agile techniques are being performed for increased efficiency.
* [[Cross-layer optimization]]
** Cross-layer research is a popular current research topic where information is shared between different communications layers to increase the knowledge and current state of the network. This could facilitate development of new and more efficient protocols. A joint protocol that addresses various design problems—routing, scheduling, channel assignment etc.—can achieve higher performance since these problems are strongly co-related.&lt;ref name="Pathak"&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. H. |last=Pathak |first2=R. |last2=Dutta |title=A Survey of Network Design Problems and Joint Design Approaches in Wireless Mesh Networks |journal=IEEE Communications Surveys &amp; Tutorials |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=396–428 |doi=10.1109/SURV.2011.060710.00062 |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that careless cross-layer design can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and extend.&lt;ref name="kawadia"&gt;{{cite book |author=V. Kawadia, P. R. Kumar |title=A Cautionary Perspective on Cross-Layer Design in IEEE Wireless Communications |pages=3–11 |date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Software-defined wireless networking
** Centralized, distributed, or hybrid? - In &lt;ref&gt;M. Abolhasan, J. Lipman, W. Ni and B. Hagelstein, "Software-defined wireless networking: centralized, distributed, or hybrid?," in IEEE Network, vol. 29, no. 4, pp. 32-38, July–August 2015. doi:10.1109/MNET.2015.7166188 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractCitations.jsp?arnumber=7166188&lt;/ref&gt; a new SDN architecture for WDNs is explored that eliminates the need for multi-hop flooding of route information and therefore enables WDNs to easily expand. The key idea is to split network control and data forwarding by using two separate frequency bands. The forwarding nodes and the SDN controller exchange link-state information and other network control signaling in one of the bands, while actual data forwarding takes place in the other band.
* Security
** A WMN can be seen as a group of nodes (clients or routers) that cooperate to provide connectivity. Such an [[open architecture]], where clients serve as routers to forward data packets, is exposed to many types of attacks that can interrupt the whole network and cause denial of service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).&lt;ref&gt;Shaker Alanazi, Kashif Saleem, Jalal Al-Muhtadi, and Abdelouahid Derhab, “Analysis of Denial of Service Impact on Data Routing in Mobile eHealth Wireless Mesh Network,” Mobile Information Systems, vol. 2016, Article ID 4853924, 19 pages, 2016. doi:10.1155/2016/4853924 [https://www.hindawi.com/journals/misy/2016/4853924/abs/]&lt;/ref&gt;
