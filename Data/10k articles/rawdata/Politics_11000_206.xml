{{History of Greece}}

The '''4th of August Regime''' ({{lang-el|Καθεστώς της 4ης Αυγούστου}}, ''Kathestós tis tetártis Avgoústou''), commonly also known as the '''Metaxas Regime''' ({{lang-el|Καθεστώς Μεταξά}}, ''Kathestós Metaxá''), was a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime under the leadership of [[General]] [[Ioannis Metaxas]] that ruled the [[Kingdom of Greece]] from 1936 to 1941. On 4 August 1936, Metaxas, with the support of [[George II of Greece|King George II]], suspended the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek parliament]] and went on to preside over a [[Conservatism#Greece|conservative]], staunchly [[anti-communist]] government. The regime took inspiration in its symbolism and rhetoric from [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], but never developed into a fully-fledged fascist dictatorship, and retained close links to Britain and the [[French Third Republic]], rather than the [[Axis powers]]. Lacking a popular base, after Metaxas' death in January 1941 the regime hinged entirely on the King. Although Greece was occupied following the [[German invasion of Greece]] in April 1941 and the Greek government was [[Greek government in exile|forced into exile]] in the [[Middle East]], several prominent figures and features of the regime, notably the notorious security chief [[Konstantinos Maniadakis]], survived for several months in cabinet until the King was forced to dismiss them in a compromise with the representatives of the old democratic political establishment.

== Origins of the regime ==
{{also|Metaxism}}
Metaxas imposed his regime primarily to fight the turbulent social situation prevalent in Greece in the 1930s, in which political factionalization had disrupted Greek [[parliamentary democracy]]. The sinking credibility of the Parliament was accompanied by several [[coup d'etat|coup]] attempts; in March 1935, a [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] [[putsch]] failed, and in the following October, elections reinforced the [[monarchist|Royalist]] majority, which allowed the exiled [[George II of Greece|King George II]] to return to Greece.

The king re-established the [[Kings of Greece|monarchy]] in the country, but the parliament, split into incompatible factions, was unable to shape a clear political majority so that the government could govern. Meanwhile, the increasing activity of the [[Communist Party of Greece|Communists]], whose 15 deputies from the 1936 elections held the balance between 143 Monarchists and 142 Liberals, Agrarians, and Republicans, created a deadlock.

In May 1935 widespread agrarian unrest (tobacco farmers) and industrial unrest in the north of the country erupted, which eventually brought General Metaxas to suspend the parliament on the eve of a major strike, on 4 August 1936. Endorsed by the King, Metaxas declared a [[state of emergency]], decreed [[martial law]], annulled various articles of the constitution and established a crisis cabinet to put to an end the growing riots and to restore social order. In one of his first speeches, Metaxas announced: "I have decided to hold all the power I need for saving Greece from the catastrophes which threaten her."

Thus the Metaxas dictatorship was born, and the period of time which would follow was named after the day Metaxas rose to absolute power: the 4th of August. The new regime was backed by small extreme political parties, and by conservatives expecting a crackdown on the communists.

=== Classical influences ===
[[File:Metaxas-regime-greek-fascism.png|thumb|250px|Young members of the Greek [[National Organisation of Youth]] (EON) hail in presence of Ioannis Metaxas.&lt;ref&gt;Metaxas Jugend - A picture album of the Greek Fascist Youth EON (2009), p.11&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The roots of Metaxas' "New State" were sought in Greece's classical history. Metaxas thought Hellenic nationalism would galvanize "the heathen values of [[ancient Greece]], specifically those of [[Sparta]], along with the Christian values of the Medieval empire of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]".&lt;ref&gt;Clogg (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Macedonia]] was also glorified as the first political unifier of the Hellenes.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilakis, Y. (2007) ''The nation and its ruins: antiquity, archaeology, and national imagination in Greece'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-923038-2}}, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; As its main symbol, the youth organization of the regime chose the [[labrys]]/[[pelekys]], the symbol of ancient Minoan Crete.

The traditional Greek values of "Country, Loyalty, Family and Religion", which Metaxas praised repeatedly, were also close to those of the ancient Spartans. The regime promoted the perceived Spartan ideals of [[self-discipline]], [[militarism]] and collective sacrifice, while Byzantium provided an emphasis on a centralized state and devotion to the [[Greek monarchy|monarchy]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilakis (2007), pp. 177-178&lt;/ref&gt;

=== External influences ===
Metaxas considered [[António de Oliveira Salazar|António Salazar]]'s [[Estado Novo Portugal|Estado Novo]] of [[Portugal]] his main inspiration{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} and surrounded himself with elements from this and other dictatorial regimes of the time. Thus his main ideological slogan was also "New State" (''Neon Kratos'') and the 4th of August regime used its own military-like uniforms, greetings, songs and rituals, including the [[Roman salute]] (which Metaxas considered Greek in origin as a salutation to the sun god Apollo, and he referred to it as the "Hellenikos Hairetismos" ("Hellenic Hailing")).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In Metaxas' case we can speak as well of some characteristics typical of authoritarian states such as 1930s Italy and Germany: the regime's propaganda presented Metaxas as "the First Peasant", "the First Worker" and as "the National Father" of the Greeks. Like his contemporaries Hitler with Führer and Mussolini with Duce, Metaxas adopted the title of ''Arhigos'', Greek for "leader" or "chieftain", and claimed that his regime had to lay the foundations for the appearance of a glorious "Third Hellenic Civilization" combining the best of ancient Greece and the Greek [[Byzantine Empire]] of the [[Middle Ages]].

== Greek totalitarianism ==
{{details|Metaxism}}
The Metaxas regime sought to comprehensively change Greece, and therefore instituted controls on Greek society, politics, language, and the economy. In each of these, the Metaxas government resembled more closely the policies that Spain would adopt later on than those of their contemporaries Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy.

{{quote|''Greece since the 4th of August became an anticommunist State, an antiparliamentary State, a totalitarian State. A State based on its farmers and workers, and so antiplutocratic. There is not, of course, a particular party to govern. This party is all the People, except of the incorrigible communists and the reactionary old parties politicians.''|Ioannis Metaxas|&lt;ref&gt;Metaxas' diary p.553&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Attempts at social control ===
Having come to power with the stated intent of restoring public order, Metaxas' state largely achieved this goal, under the supervision of what can be described as its most fascist member, minister of public order [[Konstantinos Maniadakis]]. Maniadakis created a second fake "communist party", published a fake "[[Rizospastis]]" and achieved the dissolution of all the communist organizations.

Metaxas' policies such as the [[censorship]] of the media, the banning of political parties and prohibition of [[Strike action|strikes]] copied contemporary European authoritarian regimes. As its far-right contemporaries Italy and Germany, the Greek State also had its political police force, the ''Asfaleia'', based upon the [[Gestapo]] (its chief Maniadakis maintained a close relationship with Himmler on methods and techniques). The objective of Asfaleia was to secure public order.

The regime also repressed the [[rebetiko]] music due to the uncompromising lyrics and favoured the traditional [[Greek folk music]]. Hashish dens, [[baglamas]] and [[bouzouki]] were banned, or at least playing in the [[Arabian maqam|eastern-style manner]] and scales. Probably inspired by the ''[[Völkisch movement]]'', a massive promotion of the [[Greek folk music]] took place, though the radio and public festivals, mainly because of the animosity of the state towards the bouzoukis and the rebetiko music. On this point the Greek communist left agreed, considering the rebetiko as "reactionary".

Soon after its inception the regime severely repressed the communists and leftists. About 15,000 people were arrested and jailed, or exiled for political reasons; some were subjected to torture. Metaxas' regime forced the Communist party underground, and also attempted to dismantle the old system of loyalties of the Royalist and Venizelist parties. Those major forces however remained, as they had for the preceding decades, and re-emerged immediately after the four-year Metaxas regime.

While Metaxas' regime did play up a supposed communist threat in order to justify its repression, the regime is not known to have committed political murders and did not instate the death penalty. Dissidents were, rather, usually banished to tiny islands in the [[Aegean sea]]. For example, the liberal leader [[George Papandreou, senior|George Papandreou]] was exiled to [[Andros]]. The [[Greek Communist Party]] (KKE), meanwhile, which had already been outlawed, remained intact. Legal restrictions against it finally were ended in 1974 during [[metapolitefsi]].

===Arts and Culture===
Metaxas, educated in the [[German Empire]] and admirer of the German culture, gave emphasis to the Art production (theatrical, literary, musical, visual arts etc.). He collaborated with significant intellectual figures of the era, like [[Stratis Myrivilis]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[Angelos Sikelianos]], [[Manolis Kalomoiris]], [[Angelos Terzakis]], [[Nelly's]] and others, to promote the ideas of the regime, especially to the youth.

Another notable policy was the use and promotion of the [[Demotic Greek]] (''Demotiki'') in the educational system -but in a conservative form-, instead of the ''[[Katharevousa]]''. [[Manolis Triantafyllidis]] was appointed for the creation of the grammar.

=== The role of youth ===
{{main|National Youth Organisation (Greece)}}
[[File:EON on parade.jpg|thumb|250px|[[National Organisation of Youth|EON]] on parade (from its official magazine ''I Neolaia''). The [[Labrys|double axe]], emblem of the organisation, is visible on the standard.]]
[[File:Ethniki Organosis Neoleas emblem.svg|thumb|140px|The emblem of EON.]]
[[File:Flag of EON.svg|thumb|The flag which was used by EON during the Fourth of August regime.]]

In order to keep and maintain the values of the regime in future years, Metaxas gave birth to the ''Ethniki Organosi Neolaias'' (Εθνική Οργάνωση Νεολαίας, [[National Organisation of Youth]], EON).

The EON brought together youths of all economic and social strata into one single body. Boys’ education emphasized discipline and physical training, while girls were taught to become supportive wives and caring mothers to breed a stronger, healthier new generation. The EON published a fortnightly magazine called ''Neolaia'' (Νεολαία, Greek for "Youth"), which had much influence both in schools and in higher education.

Metaxas' vision was to create, through the youth, the "Third Hellenic Civilization", a continuity of the ancient Greek and Byzantine civilization.

The EON was disbanded by the German-Italian occupying authority in Greece following its vigorous resistance of the invasion.

=== Nationalism ===

As in most other totalitarian regimes, the 4th of August regime adopted a strong nationalistic program: although Metaxas was opposed to the invasion of Asia Minor as part of the [[Megali Idea]], he used strong nationalist language concerning Greek minorities in neighbouring countries {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and in answering threats from Greece's neighbours in the still volatile southeast Europe. As with many nation states at the time, he used language exalting his people's "race". 

Ethnic (mainly Slavic speakers) and religious minorities were persecuted under Metaxas' rule.&lt;ref name="kallis"&gt;Kallis&lt;/ref&gt; The regime, however, was relatively tolerant to the [[History of the Jews in Greece|Greek Jews]], repealing the anti-Semitic laws of previous regimes. A large community of Sephardic Jews was present in the region of Thessaloniki which was annexed by Greece in 1913, and Jews were largely in opposition to [[Venizelism]]. Metaxas was firmly opposed to the irredentist factions of the Slavophones of northern Greece (consisting of Macedonians and Bulgarians mainly in Aegean Macedonia and Thrace), some of whom underwent political persecution due to advocacy of irredentism with regard to neighbouring countries.&lt;ref name="kallis" /&gt;

Metaxas' regime continued repression of the use of Slavic languages both in public and in private and of expressions of Slavic cultural distinctiveness. Despite their supposed disloyalty, however, Slavophone Greeks identified with the Greek state and fought ferociously for Greece on the Italo-Albanian front. Again in contrast to some totalitarian regimes, no mass killings were ever instituted and there is no evidence that any were planned.&lt;ref name="kallis" /&gt;

=== Economic policy ===

One of the 4th of August government's main objectives was the repudiation of the old capitalist system and its replacement with a [[corporatism|corporatist economic system]] in order to promote national and social solidarity. This idea "harmonized perfectly with Metaxas' convictions on social and national solidarity as well as his rejection of individualism and class struggle". The plan for the creation of a corporatist state was manifest in the early days of the regime by public declarations by Metaxas and by government ministers.&lt;ref name="sarandis"&gt;Constantine Sarandis, "The Ideology and Character of the Metaxas Regime", ''The Metaxas Dictatorship: Aspects of Greece, 1936-1940'', pages 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

To this end, Deputy Premier and Finance Minister [[Konstantinos Zavitsianos]] "published details about a horizontal (according to branches of production), not vertical (according to social class), syndicalist organization" of the state. However, due to the external crisis with Italy, the plan had to be temporarily postponed with the result that it never fully materialized.&lt;ref name="sarandis" /&gt;

Metaxas' government, initially unpopular, also gained popularity through an elaborate program to socialize the Greek economy, including:

* [[unemployment insurance]] 
* [[maternity leave]].
* a five-day, 40-hour workweek.
* guaranteed two-week vacations with pay (or two weeks' double pay in place of the vacation).
* stricter work safety standards.

Many elements of this program persist in Greek economic policy. Metaxas' regime founded the Workers' Center (Εργατικό Κέντρο), which was established to look after workers' housing and recreation, among other things.

The 4th of August regime initially stabilized the [[drachma]], which had been suffering from high inflation. Exploiting the newfound solidity of the currency, Metaxas' government embarked on large [[public works]] programs (such as the [[Ellinikon International Airport]]), including [[drainage system (agriculture)|land drainage]], construction of railways, road improvements, and modernization of the telecommunications infrastructure.

Metaxas' economic program met with initial success, with a marked rise in [[per capita income]] and temporary decline in unemployment in Greece between 1936 and 1938 (unemployment skyrocketed after 1938). Capitalizing on this success, the government instituted [[debt relief]] for farmers and instituted [[price floor]]s on some agricultural goods to redistribute wealth to the countryside.

Also, on the legislation sector the Greek civil code, was finally completed by a jurist commission; a plan pending since the years of [[Otto of Greece]].

==Other==
Another organization established by the regime was for the first time a state radio station; the YRE, suitable also for the propaganda of the regime.

== Differences from other totalitarian regimes ==

There is some debate over how the regime relates to other totalitarian regimes of the 1930s, especially [[Italian Fascism]] and German [[Nazism]]. [[Richard Clogg]] argues that while the regime had "superficial trappings of Fascism" and Metaxas "did not disguise his admiration for Nazism and Fascism", it is "more correctly categorised as paternalist-authoritarian rather than fascist".&lt;ref&gt;Clogg (1987), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the main and important differences of Metaxas' regime as compared to fascism proper include:

*The anti-imperialist speech of the regime.
*The pro-Jewish stance of Metaxas and tolerance to religious minorities.
*The emphasis on the progress of the Greek Arts and Culture (as a plan for the ''[[Third Hellenic Civilization]]'').
*Absence of a mass political base for the regime, in the form of a political party or movement.
*No representative architecture or monuments.

== The end of the 4th of August regime ==
[[File:GambierParryMetaxasJorgeIIDalbiacYPapagosEnero1941--128421.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Ioannis Metaxas]] with [[George II of Greece|King George II]] and [[Alexandros Papagos]] during a meeting of the Anglo-Greek War Council.]]

Foreign policy was one of the main concerns of the 4th of August regime. Metaxas, who had studied in Germany as a youth, was pro-German, while the King was pro-British. This caused heated discussions between the two, but the reality of 1930s Europe was that Greece's security depended less on Germany than on her traditional protector, the [[United Kingdom]], which was the [[Great Power]] dominating the Eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] with her fleet. In addition, Italian leader Benito Mussolini's grandiose schemes to build a [[new Roman Empire]] in the Mediterranean directly clashed with Greek pretensions to control the Aegean Sea and the [[Dodecanese islands]] (by then under Italian control) and to exert stronger influence in Albania.

As tensions and threat of war increased in Europe just before World War II, the situation was almost exactly the same as the position before World War I, when Greece had strong pro-German affinities in government, but it depended on Britain for its security. Most observers were anticipating Greece would attempt to remain neutral. Metaxas indeed attempted to maintain strict neutrality, but Italian expansionism eventually led to an Italian ultimatum and to the [[Greco-Italian War]]. However, Greek forces repelled the Italian invasion completely and brought the Italian soldiers back into Albania, where the invasion had been launched. In fact, some territories in Albania [[Greek minority in Albania|where a Greek minority lives]] were claimed to be 'alliberated' and Metaxas' plans were to unite them with the rest of Greece.

Metaxas died suddenly in January 1941 among dark circumstances. His death raised hopes of a liberalization of his regime and the restoration of parliamentary rule, but King George quashed these hopes when he retained the regime's machinery in place. In the meantime, [[Adolf Hitler]] was reluctantly{{says who?|date=June 2017}} forced to divert German troops to rescue Mussolini from defeat, and began [[Battle of Greece]] through [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and Bulgaria on 6 April 1941.

Despite British assistance, by the end of May, the Germans had overrun most of the country. The King and the government escaped to Crete, where they stayed until the end of the [[Battle of Crete]]. They then transferred to [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], where a [[Greek government in exile]] was established. Meanwhile, in Greece a fascist puppet government was placed into power by the Axis.

== Legacy ==
As the Axis occupation ended, Greece descended into [[Greek Civil War|civil war]] between the communist-dominated forces of the left, operating in Greece and from bases in the south of Yugoslavia, and the U.S.- and UK-aligned forces of the political right. This was the first major protracted combat of the [[Cold War]], one of the first exercises in U.S. policy of [[Containment]], and a subject of the [[Truman Doctrine]] of U.S. President [[Harry Truman]]. The alignments were quite different from the Venizelist-Monarchist National Schism, as most Venizelists supported the right-wing alliance during the civil war.

In these regions, the needs of rural communities in mountainous, coastal and other resource-poor areas are given particular attention. The Foundation's activities often reinforce the work of other sister agencies within the [[Aga Khan Development Network]] (AKDN). While these agencies are guided by different mandates pertaining to their respective fields of expertise (the environment, culture, microfinance, health, education, architecture, rural development), their activities are often coordinated with one another in order to "multiply" the overall effect that the Network has in any given place or community. AKF also collaborates with local, national and international partners in order to bring about sustainable improvements of life in the 19 countries in which it works. The Foundation's head office is located in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=g6uztzPOqtUC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=akf+headquarters+geneva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinibbz98bQAhUF1RoKHeVfAAUQ6AEIKTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=akf%20headquarters%20geneva&amp;f=false|title=NGOs and Organizational Change: Discourse, Reporting, and Learning|last=Ebrahim|first=Alnoor|date=2005-05-12|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521671576|location=|pages=147|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of focus==
The Foundation concentrates its resources on selected issues in [[health]], [[education]], [[rural development]], [[Natural environment|environment]] and the strengthening of [[civil society]]. Seeking innovative approaches to generic problems, it tries to identify solutions that can be adapted to conditions in many different regions and replicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=amPc4uJALpIC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=akf+focus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW0uO1-MbQAhUFWxoKHa3GDcg4ChDoAQgXMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=akf%20focus&amp;f=false|title=Teaching Korea: Modernization, Model Minorities, and American Internationalism in the Cold War Era|last=|first=|date=2008-01-01|publisher=ProQuest|year=|isbn=9781109098709|location=|pages=172|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-cutting issues that are also addressed by the Foundation include [[Training and development|human resource development]], [[Community-driven development|community participation]], and [[gender and development]].

==Funding and grant making==
The Aga Khan Foundation is the principal [[Grant-in-aid|grant-making]] agency for social development within the [[Aga Khan Development Network]]. Grants are normally given to local organizations interested in testing new solutions, in learning from experience and in being agents of lasting change. These organizations must share the Foundation's and [[Aga Khan Development Network|Aga Khan Development Network's]] goals in their specific areas of focus. If no established group exists, the Foundation occasionally creates new organizations to tackle particularly important problems.

The Aga Khan provides the Foundation with regular funding for administration as well as making contributions to its endowment. The [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] community contributes volunteers, time, professional services and substantial financial resources. Other funding sources include income from investments and grants from government, institutional and private sector partners, as well as donations from individuals around the world.

One programme series funded by the Foundation was the [[BBC World News]] television series ''Architects on the Frontline'', which was about entries to the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] competition, and was criticized by the media watchdog [[Ofcom]] for breaking United Kingdom broadcasting rules; viewers were not informed that the series, which praised the competition, was sponsored content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|website=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33971919|title=News channels breached sponsorship rules, Ofcom says|date=18 August 2015|access-date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Among other recognition for its work, the Foundation received the 2005 Award for Most Innovative Development Project from the Global Development Network for the [[Aga Khan Rural Support Programme]] (AKRSP). The AKRSP has successfully been replicated to form the [[Rural Support Programmes Network]] in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060815165947/http://www.gdnet.org/middle.php?primary_link_id=3&amp;secondary_link_id=9 Global Development Network: Global Development Awards&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.gdnet.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=IV9m8gF6XDcC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=AKRSP+replication&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMxtTT9sbQAhXCXhoKHVPjBrIQ6AEIOjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=AKRSP%20replication&amp;f=false|title=Ending Poverty in South Asia: Ideas that Work|last=Narayan-Parker|first=Deepa|last2=Glinskaya|first2=Elena E.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=9780821368770|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic focus==
The Foundation normally intervenes where it has a strong volunteer base. It is currently active in the following countries: [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Canada]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], [[Pakistan]], [[Portugal]], [[Switzerland]], [[Syria]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]].

I said no. I kept on having these dreams in which I would see her face and how she was going to look. In the end, [she] was born exactly as I saw her.” The birth came during a lull in Lebanon's civil war, so her father named her Amal{{snd}} Arabic for “hope.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10258">'''Amendments to the Citizenship Law''' of Latvia, suggested by a popular initiative in 2012, sought to grant citizenship of Latvia, starting in 2014, to those [[non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens]] who would not refuse it. The proposed amendments were rejected by the Central Election Commission. The CEC decision was contested by the proponents of the amendments, who applied to court. The court proceedings were suspended in 2013, with the Supreme Court requesting the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia|Constitutional Court]] to decide on the compliance of some applicable provisions with the Constitution.

==The draft law and gathering signatures==

In 2011, the party [[ForHRUL]] initiated gathering signatures (certified by notaries) for amendments to the [[Latvian nationality law|Citizenship law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/politics/zapchel-nachinaet-sbor-podpisej-za-referendum-po-nulevomu-variantu.d?id=40370427 ЗаПЧЕЛ начинает сбор подписей за референдум по "нулевому варианту"] [[Delfi (web portal)|DELFI]] 2011{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments provide to add to the Section 2 of the law (establishing which groups form the circle of citizens of Latvia) the following Clause 6: “Since 1 January 2014 – non-citizens, who have not submitted an application on keeping the status of a non-citizen until 30 November 2013, in a manner to be determined by the Cabinet of Ministers” and to add some transitional provisions.

In May, 2012, the Minister of Justice [[Gaidis Bērziņš]] has commented on the collection of signatures through his spokesperson, stating that the public officials should "exclude the opportunity to be involved in a situation which could be understood as subversive and compromising"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/jaunumi/tm_info.html?news_id=4163 Tieslietu ministrs aicina ikvienu amatpersonu apzināties savu atbildību pret valsti] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513005546/http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/jaunumi/tm_info.html?news_id=4163 |date=2012-05-13 }}{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentary group of the [[Harmony Centre]] has filed a question to the minister, considering him to exert pressure upon notaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://titania.saeima.lv/LIVS11/saeimalivs_lmp.nsf/0/CA3A916CECCA6E17C22579FA00240426?OpenDocument Nr. 7/P11]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, 2012, it was announced, that the 10,000 signatures, necessary at the first stage, are collected. Prime Minister [[Valdis Dombrovskis]] has expressed hope that there will be no second stage of gathering signatures and called the Central Election Commission to consider, whether the second stage should be conducted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/politics/premer-nado-podumat-sobirat-li-voobsche-podpisi-za-referendum-o-negrazhdanah.d?id=42629076 Премьер: надо подумать, собирать ли вообще подписи за референдум о негражданах] [[Delfi (web portal)|DELFI]] 2012{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President's chancery invited the CEC to consider not only the legal drafting, but also the content of the draft law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/politics/proekt-o-negrazhdanah-berzinsh-somnevaetsya-v-kachestve.d?id=42636522 Проект о негражданах: Берзиньш сомневается в качестве] [[Delfi (web portal)|DELFI]] 2012{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consideration by the Central Election Commission==

On 4 September 2012, the signatures were submitted to the Central Election Commission. On 27 September, the CEC postponed deciding on the destiny of the draft law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/politics/referendum-po-negrazhdanam-cik-otlozhil-reshenie.d?id=42703446 Референдум по негражданам: ЦИК отложил решение] [[Delfi (web portal)|DELFI]] 2012 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CEC' verification confirmed that the draft law was signed by the necessary number of voters (12,686 valid signatures of citizens, while 10,000 were needed at the organisers' paid stage). On 1 November 2012, the CEC decided by 6 votes to 2 with 1 abstaining, that the draft law is not consistent with the [[Constitution of Latvia|Constitution]], namely the state continuity doctrine, and consequently cannot be considered fully elaborated; therefore it should not be referred to the state-paid stage of collection of signatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/30441.html Lēmums Nr. 6]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==

The CEC decision was appealed against in two lawsuits, by those who submitted the draft law to CEC and by one of those who signed the draft law, both cases being launched in November, according to the general order of appeals against CEC decisions (before the administrative district court).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/politics/referendum-po-negrazhdanam-sudebnaya-tyazhba-nachalas.d?id=42856792 Референдум по негражданам: судебная тяжба началась] [[Delfi (web portal)|DELFI]] 26.11.2012 {{ru icon}}; [http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/legislation/?doc=65494 Kuzins contests decision to halt signature drive for "non-citizen referendum" in Latvia] The Baltic Course&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 2012,  a set of amendments to the law on legislative initiatives, adopted on November, 8, came into force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=252963 Grozījumi likumā "Par tautas nobalsošanu, likumu ierosināšanu un Eiropas pilsoņu iniciatīvu"]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides  the CEC with the competence to refuse gathering signatures on the grounds of draft law not conforming with the Constitution and provides for a special way of judicial review - such CEC refusals are appealed against before the Department of Administrative Cases of the Supreme Court and must be adjudicated during one month. The administrative district court transferred both cases to the Department of Administrative Cases of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/politics/referendum-o-negrazhdanah-delo-rassmotryat-v-kratchajshie-sroki.d?id=42913052 Референдум о негражданах: дело рассмотрят в кратчайшие сроки] [[Delfi (web portal)|DELFI]] 18.12.2012{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2013, the Department of Administrative Cases of the Supreme Court has adopted a decision&lt;ref&gt;[http://at.gov.lv/files/uploads/files/archive/department3/2013/1-sa-2013.doc Lēmums]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; to adjourn the proceedings in the case and to request the Constitutional Court to evaluate whether the draft law conforms with the Constitution and [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|Declaration of Independence]]. The decision was described as unexpected in the legal journal "Jurista vārds": the opinions of the experts invited by the journal have ranged from "The Senate's actions are well-grounded" to "haven't they mentioned that the Constitutional Court does not evaluate draft laws?".&lt;ref&gt;''Gailīte D.'' [http://www.juristavards.lv/index.php?menu=default&amp;laidiens_id=11645&amp;red_s=1 Bumbas spēle] Jurista vārds Nr. 7 (758) 19.02.2013{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, Kristine. "Popular Initiatives as Means of Altering the Core of the Republic of Latvia", ''Juridica International''. Vol. 20, 2013.  p. 152 ISSN1406-5509]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; 

On 20 February, the Department of Administrative Cases of the Supreme Court reconsidered its own decision and asked the Constitutional Court another question instead&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imhoclub.lv/material/referendum_po_grazhdanstvu_budet/page/2 Lēmums]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; - whether the provisions of the amended law on legislative initiative, which give the competence to review the constitutionality of the draft laws to the CEC and the Supreme Court, conform with the Article 1 of the Constitution (the principle of separation of powers).

On 12 March, the Constitutional Court has launched proceedings on the application by the Department of Administrative Cases of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/upload/2013-06-01_PR_par_ierosinasanu_ENG.pdf |title=Press Release Case No. 2013-06-01 12.03.2013 |access-date=2013-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219234140/http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/upload/2013-06-01_PR_par_ierosinasanu_ENG.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 December, the Constitutional Court decided that CEC's and the Supreme Court's competence is constitutional, provided that they only stop initiatives obviously contradicting the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-06-01_Spriedums_ENG.pdf Judgment in case No. 2013-06-01]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 February 2014, the Supreme Court has delivered the judgment considering the CEC decision to be lawful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://at.gov.lv/lv/pazinojumi-presei/par-tiesas-sedem/2014/kasacijas-instance/6286-noraida-pieteikumu-par-centralas-velesanu-komisijas-lemuma-atcelsanu/ Noraida pieteikumu par Centrālās vēlēšanu komisijas lēmuma atcelšanu]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Atatürk sidebar}}
'''Atatürk's Reforms''' ({{lang-tr|{{italics correction|Atatürk Devrimleri}}}}) were a series of political, legal, religious, cultural, social, and economic policy changes that were designed to convert the new [[Republic of Turkey]] into a [[secularism in Turkey|secular]], modern [[nation-state]] and implemented under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] in accordance with [[Kemalism|Kemalist ideology]]. Central to these reforms were the belief that Turkish society would have to Westernize itself both politically and culturally in order to modernize.&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Eisenstadt, "The Kemalist Regime and Modernization: Some Comparative and Analytical Remarks," in J. Landau, ed., Atatürk and the Modernization of Turkey, Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 1984, 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Political reforms involved a number of fundamental institutional changes that brought end of many traditions, and followed a carefully planned program to unravel the complex system that had developed over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob M. Landau "Atatürk and the Modernization of Turkey" page 57.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reforms began with the modernization of the constitution, including enacting the new  [[Turkish Constitution of 1924|Constitution of 1924]] which replaced the [[Turkish Constitution of 1921|Constitution of 1921]], and the adaptation of European laws and [[jurisprudence]] to the needs of the new republic. This was followed by a thorough [[secularization]] and modernization of the administration, with particular focus on the education system.

Historically, Atatürk's reforms follow the Ottoman Empire's [[Tanzimât]] period, meaning ''reorganization'', that began in 1839 and ended with the [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Constitutional Era]] in 1876,&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, William L &amp; Martin Bunton, A History of the Modern Middle East: 4th Edition, Westview Press: 2009, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the various efforts of secularization, democratization, and modernization during the [[Second Constitutional Era]] from 1908 to 1913.

=== Reformation of Islam ===
{{See also|Political aspects of Islam|Political Islam|Protestant Reformation}}

The Ottoman Empire was an [[Islamic state]] in which the head of the state, the Sultan, also held the position of [[Ottoman Caliphate|Caliph]]. The social system was organized around the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] structure. The millet structure allowed a great degree of religious, cultural and ethnic continuity across the society but at the same time permitted the religious ideology to be incorporated into the administrative, economic and political system. One can define this way of life  as [[Islamism]] (Political Islam): "the belief that Islam should guide social and political as well as personal life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berman|first=Sheri|title=Islamism, Revolution, and Civil Society|journal=Perspectives on Politics| volume=1| issue=2| year=2003| page=258| doi=10.1017/S1537592703000197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two sections of the elite group at the helm of the discussions for the future. These were the "Islamist reformists" and the "Westernists". Many basic goals were common to both groups. Some secular intellectuals, and even certain reform-minded Muslim thinkers, accepted the view that social progress in Europe had followed the Protestant reformation, as expressed in [[François Guizot]]'s ''Histoire de la civilisation en Europe'' (1828). The reform-minded Muslim thinkers concluded from the Lutheran experience that the reform of Islam was imperative. [[Abdullah Cevdet]] and Kılıçzâde İsmail Hakkı (İsmail Hakkı Kılıçoğlu), who were westernist thinkers, took their inspiration rather from the subsequent marginalization of religion in European societies.&lt;ref name=Hanioglu53&gt;
{{cite book| last=Hanioglu| first=Sükrü|title=Ataturk: An Intellectual Biography|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=53}}
&lt;/ref&gt; To them, a reformed religion had only a temporary role to play as an instrument for the modernization of society, after which it would be cast aside (from public life and limited to personal life).&lt;ref name=Hanioglu53/&gt; All-out attack on Islam in a predominantly Muslim society was injudicious. A reconfigured version of Islam could be co-opted to serve as a vehicle for progress and enlightenment. Atatürk's achievement was to amplify the common ground and put the country on a fast track of reforms. Implemented reforms had implications on the Islamic world. One significant implication involved the abolition of the [[Ottoman Caliphate]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah, ''Fall and Rise of the Islamic State'', Princeton University Press, 2008, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Westernization ===
{{See also|Eastern Question|Sick man of Europe}} 
The Young Turks and other Ottoman intellectuals asked the question of the position of the empire regarding the West (primarily taken to mean Christian Europe).&lt;ref name=Hanioglu54/&gt; The West was symbolized by intellectual and scientific ascendancy, and provided the blueprint for the ideal society of the future.&lt;ref name=Hanioglu54&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanioglu|first=Sükrü|title=Ataturk: An Intellectual Biography|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reformers declared the question was decided: Turkey would look to the West.

{{See also|Politics of Turkey}}
Until the moment the republic was formally proclaimed, the [[Ottoman Empire]] was still in existence, with its heritage of religious and dynastic authority. The dynasty was abolished by the Ankara Government, but its traditions and cultural symbols remained active among the people (though less so among the elite).

The elements of the political system visioned by Atatürk's Reforms developed in stages, but in 1935, when the last part of the Atatürk's Reforms removed the reference to Islam; the political system became a secular ([[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#2.1|2.1]]) and democratic ([[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#2.1|2.1]]), republic  ([[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#1.1|1.1]]) that derives its sovereignty ([[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#6.1|6.1]]) from the people. The sovereignty rests with the Turkish Nation, who delegates its exercise to an elected unicameral parliament (position in 1935), the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]]. The [[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#Preamble|preamble]] also invokes the principles of nationalism, defined as the "material and spiritual well-being of the Republic" (position in 1935). The basic nature of the Republic is [[laïcité]] ([[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#2|2]]), [[social equality]]  ([[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#2|2]]), [[Legal egalitarianism|equality before law]] ([[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#10|10]]), and the indivisibility of the Republic and of the Turkish Nation ([[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#3.1|3.1]])."  Thus, it sets out to found a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[nation-state]] (position in 1935) based on the principles of [[secular democracy]]. There exists [[separation of powers]] between the Legislative Power ([[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#7.1|7.1]]), Executive Power ([[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#8.1|8.1]]), and Judicial Power ([[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey#9.1|9.1]]) of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. The separation of powers between the [[legislative]] and the [[executive (government)|executive]] is a loose one, whereas the one between the executive and the legislative with the [[judiciary]] is a strict one.

=== The Republic (representative democracy) ===
{{See also|Republicanism in Turkey}}

The most fundamental reforms allowed the Turkish nation to exercise [[popular sovereignty]] through [[representative democracy]].  The [[Republic]] of Turkey ("Türkiye Cumhuriyeti")  was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 by the Turkish Grand National Assembly.

==== Constitutional Republic (1921 &amp; 1924) ====
{{See also|Constitutional history of Turkey}}
The model for the system is Constitutional Republic. In the Turkish Constitutional Republic, government created and controlled by the Law of a Constitution.

The [[Turkish Constitution of 1921]] was the fundamental law of Turkey for a brief period from 1921 to 1924. It was ratified by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] in January 1921. It was a simple document consisting of only 23 short articles. The major driving force behind the preparation of a 1921 Constitution that derived its sovereignty from the nation and not from the Sultan, the absolute monarch of the Ottoman Empire. The 1921 Constitution also served as the legal basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]] during 1919–1923, since it would refute the principles of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] of 1918 signed by the Ottoman Empire, by which a great majority of the Empire's territory would have to be ceded to the Entente powers that had won the First World War. In October 1923 the constitution was amended to declare Turkey to be a [[republic]].

In April 1924, the constitution was replaced by an entirely new document, the [[Turkish Constitution of 1924]].

==== Abolition of Sultanate (1922) ====
{{See also|Abolition of the Ottoman sultanate}}
On November 1, 1922, the [[Ottoman sultan|Ottoman Sultanate]] was abolished by the Turkish [[Grand National Assembly]] and Sultan [[Mehmed VI]] departed the country.  This allowed the [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish nationalist]] government in Ankara to become the sole governing entity in the nation.

Mehmed VI sought refuge aboard the British warship ''[[HMS Malaya|Malaya]]'' on November 17.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/mehmedvi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Multi-party system ====
{{See also|List of historical parties in Turkey|Multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey}}
The bicameral system of the [[General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman parliament]]—composed of an upper house, the [[Senate of the Ottoman Empire|Senate]] of ''viziers'', assigned by the Sultan, and the lower house, the [[Chamber of Deputies (Ottoman Empire)|Chamber of Deputies]], selected by two-level elections—was dissolved, which had already been defunct since the [[Occupation of Istanbul|Allied occupation of Istanbul]] in 1920 and consequently.

The foundation of the Turkish Grand National Assembly followed the dissolution of the lower house of the Ottoman parliament. The new system, which gave primacy to national independence and popular sovereignty, established the offices of Prime Minister and President while placing legislative power within a [[unicameral]] [[Grand National Assembly]]. The Assembly was elected by [[direct election]] using [[proportional representation]]. It was based on [[Party system]], which governance by political parties was adapted. The only political party was the "[[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|People's Party]]" (''Halk Fırkası''), which was founded by Atatürk in the initial years of the independence war. In 1924 it was renamed the "Republican People's Party" (''Cumhuriyet Halk Fırkası'') and in 1935 ''Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi''. The single-party regime was established de facto after the adoption of the 1924 constitution.

The term "de facto single-party state" is used to define the period as the dominant-party system (in this case Republican People's Party), unlike the single-party state, allowed democratic multiparty elections, but existing practices effectively prevent the opposition from winning the elections. The [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] was the only elected party in the parliament between 1925 and 1945. There were other parties. A notable example was [[Nezihe Muhittin]] who founded the first women's party ''Kadınlar Halk Fırkası'' ("[[Women's People Party]]") in June 1923. Women's People Party was not legalized as the Republic was not officially declared. The [[Progressive Republican Party (Turkey)|Progressive Republican Party]] (''Terakkiperver Cumhuriyet Fırkası'') was established between 1924 and 1925 under the parliament. Its leader was [[Kazım Karabekir]]. It was banned after the [[Sheikh Said rebellion]]. The Liberal Republican Party (''Serbest Cumhuriyet Fırkası'') established in 1930 under the parliament, and was later dissolved by its founder.

The effective [[Multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey|multi-party period]] began in 1945; the next year, the Republican People's Party won the [[Turkish general election, 1946|first multi-party elections]]. In the [[Turkish general election, 1950|1950 elections]], the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, historical)|Democratic Party]] won, becoming the first opposition party to win elections.

=== Civic independence (popular sovereignty) ===
{{See also|Secular state}}
The establishment of [[popular sovereignty]] involved confronting centuries-old traditions. The reform process was characterized by a struggle between progressives and conservatives. The changes were both conceptually radical and culturally significant. In the Ottoman Empire, the people of each millet had traditionally enjoyed a degree of autonomy, with their own leadership, collecting their own taxes and living according to their own system of religious/cultural law. The Ottoman Muslims had a strict hierarchy of [[ulama]], with the [[Sheikh ul-Islam]] holding the highest rank. A Sheikh ul-Islam was chosen by a royal warrant among the qadis of important cities. The Sheikh ul-Islam issued fatwas, which were written interpretations of the Quran that had authority over the community. The Sheikh ul-Islam represented the law of shariah. This office was in the Shar’iyya wa Awqaf Ministry. Sultan Mehmed VI's cousin Abdulmecid continued on as [[Ottoman Caliphate|Ottoman Caliph]].

Besides the political structure; as a part of civic independence, religious education system was replaced by a national education system on March 3, 1924, and The [[Islamic]] courts and [[Sharia|Islamic canon law]] gave way to a [[secular]] law structure based on the [[Zivilgesetzbuch|Swiss Civil Code]], which is detailed under their headings.

==== Abolition of Caliphate (1924) and Millet System ====
{{See also|Ottoman Caliphate|Millet (Ottoman Empire)}}
In the secular  [[State (polity)|state]] or country purports to be officially neutral in matters of religion, supporting neither religion nor irreligion and claims to treat all its citizens equally regardless of religion, and claims to avoid preferential treatment for a citizen from a particular religion/nonreligion over other religions/nonreligion.&lt;ref&gt;Madeley, John T. S. and Zsolt Enyedi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n5Brda6FmswC&amp;dq Church and state in contemporary Europe: the chimera of neutrality], p. __, 2003 Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Reformers followed the European model (French model) of secularization. In European model of secularizing; states typically involves granting individual religious freedoms, disestablishing state religions, stopping public funds to be used for a religion, freeing the legal system from religious control, freeing up the education system, tolerating citizens who change religion or abstain from religion, and allowing political leadership to come to power regardless of religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baubérot [http://www.ambafrance-us.org/atoz/secular.asp The secular principle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222013645/http://www.ambafrance-us.org/atoz/secular.asp |date=2008-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In establishing a [[secular state]], the Ottoman Caliphate, held by the Ottomans since 1517, abolished and to mediate the power of religion in the public sphere (including recognized minority religions in the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]) left to the Directorate for Religious Affairs. Under the reforms official recognition of the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman millets]] withdrawn. Shar’iyya wa Awqaf Ministry followed the Office of Caliphate. This office was replaced by the Presidency of Religious Affairs.

The abolishing of the position of Caliphate and  Sheikh ul-Islam was followed by a common, secular authority. Many of the religious communities failed to adjust to the new regime. This was exacerbated by the emigration or impoverishment, due to deteriorating economic conditions. Families that hitherto had financially supported religious community institutions such as hospitals and schools stop doing so.

==== Directorate for Religious Affairs ====
Atatürk's reforms define [[laïcité]] (as of 1935) as permeating both the government and the religious sphere. Minority religions, like the [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenian]] or [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox]]y are guaranteed protection by the constitution as ''individual'' faiths (personal sphere), but this guarantee does not give any rights to any ''religious communities'' (social sphere). (This differentiation applies to Islam and Muslims as well. Atatürk's reforms, as of 1935, assume the social sphere is secular.)

The Treaty of Lausanne, the internationally binding agreement of the establishment of the Republic, does not specify any nationality or ethnicity. It simply identifies non-Muslims in general and provides the legal framework which gives certain explicit religious rights to [[Jews in Turkey|Jews]], [[Greeks in Turkey|Greeks]], and [[Armenians in Turkey|Armenians]] without naming them.

=== Public administration ===

==== New capital ====
The reform movement turned its back on the perceived corruption and decadence of cosmopolitan Istanbul and its Ottoman heritage,&lt;ref&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 391–392&lt;/ref&gt; as well as electing to choose a capital more geographically centered in Turkey. During the disastrous 1912–13 [[First Balkan War]], Bulgarian troops had advanced to [[Çatalca]], mere miles from Istanbul, creating a fear that the Ottoman capital would have to be moved to Anatolia; the reform movement wanted to avoid a similar incident with Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Şimşir |first=Bilal |title=Ankara’nın Başkent Oluşu |url=http://atam.gov.tr/ankaranin-baskent-olusu-2/ |publisher=atam.gov.tr |accessdate=15 March 2013 |language=tr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130504163819/http://atam.gov.tr/ankaranin-baskent-olusu-2/ |archivedate=4 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's new capital was set in [[Ankara]] on 13 October 1923.

==Social reforms==
{{See also|Secularism in Turkey}}
Some social institutions had religious overtones, and held considerable influence over public life. Social change also included centuries old religious social structures that has been deeply rooted within the society, some were established within the [[state organisation of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Kemalist reforms brought effective social change on women's suffrage.

=== Public sphere ===
{{See also|Public sphere|Discourse}}
In the Ottoman [[public sphere]] religious groups exerted their power. [[Public sphere]] is an area in [[social relation|social life]] where individuals  together to freely discuss and identify societal problems, and through that discussion influence political action. It is "a discursive space in which individuals and groups congregate to discuss matters of mutual interest and, where possible, to reach a common judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1080/03637759809376439 | last = Hauser | first = Gerard | authorlink = Gerard Hauser | title = Vernacular Dialogue and the Rhetoricality of Public Opinion | journal = Communication Monographs | volume =65 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–107 Page. 86 |date=June 1998 | issn = 0363-7751 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atatürk's Reforms target the structure of the public space.

The construction of a secular nation-state was a huge enterprise in a conservative Muslim society, though Atatürk Reforms benefit from the elaborate blueprints for a future society prepared by the Ottoman proponents of scientism during the Second Constitutional Period. 
&lt;ref name=Hanioglu132&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanioglu|first=Sükrü|title=Ataturk: An Intellectual Biography|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Ottoman society dismissed this blueprint as the ruminations of marginal intellectuals, and the religious establishment denounced them as heresy, but the conditions of victory in 1922 (The Republic) brought into being a situation necessary for their implementation by a true believer (true believer = reform the religion to its original form).&lt;ref name=Hanioglu132/&gt; Highlighting the public's lack of knowledge regarding Kemal's intentions, the public cheered: "We are returning to the days of the first caliphs." &lt;ref&gt;Mango, Atatürk, 394&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Empire had a social system based on religious affiliation. The religious insignia extended to every social function. It was common to wear clothing that identified the person with their own particular religious grouping and accompanied headgear which distinguished rank and profession throughout the Ottoman Empire. The [[turban]]s, [[Fez (hat)|fez]]es, [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s and head-dresses surmounting Ottoman styles showed the sex, rank, and profession (both civil and military) of the wearer. These styles were accompanied with a strict regulation beginning with the reign of [[Süleyman the Magnificent]]. Sultan Mahmud II followed on the example of [[Peter the Great]] in [[Russia]] in modernizing the Empire and used the dress code of 1826 which developed the symbols (classifications) of [[feudalism]] among the public. These reforms like that of [[Government reform of Peter I|Peter I of Russia]] or [[Mahmud II#Reforms|Sultan Mahmud II]], was achieved through introduction of the progressive customs by decrees, while banning the traditional customs. The view of their social change proposed; if the permanence of secularism was to be assured by removal of persistence of traditional cultural values (the religious insignia), a considerable degree of cultural receptivity by the public to the further social change could be achieved. The dress code gave a chance for the removal of persistence of traditional values in the society.

Atatürk's Reforms defined a non-civilized (non-scientific, non-positivist) person as one who functioned within the boundaries of superstition. The [[ulema]] was not a scientific group, and it was acting according to superstitions developed throughout centuries.  Their name was "''Gerici''", literally means "backward", but it was used to mean ''bigot''. On February 25, 1925 parliament passed a law stating that [[religion]] was not to be used as a tool in [[politics]]. The question became how this law could be brought to life in a country whose scholars are dominated by the ulema. [[Kemalism|Kemalist ideology]] waged a war against superstition by banning the practices of the ulema and promoting the civilized way ("westernization"), with establishing lawyers, teachers, doctors.  The ban on the ulema's social existence came in the form of dress code. The strategic goal was to change the large influence of the ulema over politics by removing them from the social arena. However, there was the danger of being perceived as anti-religious. Kemalists defended themselves by stating "Islam viewed all forms of superstition (non-scientific) nonreligious". The ulema's power was established during the Ottoman Empire with the conception that secular institutions were all subordinate to religion; the ulema were emblems of religious piety, and therefore rendering them powerful over state affairs.&lt;ref name=inancik&gt;Inalcik, Halil. 1973. "Learning, the Medrese, and the Ulemas." In the Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300–1600. New York: Praeger, pp. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Kemalists claimed: {{quote |The state will be ruled by [[positivism]] not [[superstition]].&lt;ref name=inancik/&gt;}}

A good example was the practice of medicine. Kemalists wanted to get rid of superstition extending to herbal medicine, potion, and religious therapy for mental illness, all of which were practised by the ulema. They excoriated those who used herbal medicine, potions, and balms, and instituted penalties against the religious men who claimed they have a say in health and medicine. On September 1, 1925, the first Turkish Medical Congress was assembled, which was only four days after Mustafa Kemal was seen on August 27 at Inebolu wearing a modern hat and one day after the [[s:tr:Atatürk'ün Kastamonu Nutku|Kastamonu speech]] on August 30.

Official measures were gradually introduced to eliminate the wearing of religious clothing and other overt signs of religious affiliation. Beginning in 1923, a series of laws progressively limited the wearing of selected items of traditional clothing. Mustafa Kemal first made the hat compulsory to the civil servants.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;İğdemir, ''Atatürk'', 165–170&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines for the proper dressing of students and state employees (public space controlled by state) was passed during his lifetime. After most of the relatively better educated civil servants adopted the hat with their own he gradually moved further. The [[s:tr:Şapka İktisası Hakkında Kanun|Hat Law of 1925]] introduced the use of Western style hats instead of the fez. Legislation did not explicitly prohibit veils or headscarves and focused instead on banning fezzes and turbans for men.  Another control on the dress was passed in 1934 with the [[:s:tr:Bazı Kisvelerin Giyilemiyeceğine Dair Kanun|law relating to the wearing of 'Prohibited Garments']]. It banned religion-based clothing, such as the veil and turban, while actively promoting western-style attire.

All printed Qurans in Turkey were in [[Classical Arabic]] (the [[sacred language]] of Islam) at the time. Previous Qurans in Turkish that were not made public existed. There was a rare [[Polyglot (book)|polyglot]] Quran written in Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Latin in the tetrapla style, prepared by [[Expert|savant]] Andrea Acolutho of Bernstadt and printed at Berlin in 1701.&lt;ref&gt;[[S.

Several renderings of the [[List of translations of the Qur'an#Turkish|Quran in the Turkish language]] were read in front of the public.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'', 181&lt;/ref&gt; These Turkish Qurans were fiercely opposed by religious conservatives. This incident impelled many leading Muslim modernists to call upon the Turkish Parliament to sponsor a Quran translation of suitable quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = M.

Ersoy declined the offer and destroyed his work, to avoid the possible public circulation of a transliteration which may remotely be faulty. Only in 1935 did the version read in public find its way to print.

The program also involved implementing a [[Turkish language|Turkish]] [[adhan]], as opposed to the conventional [[Arabic language|Arabic]] call to prayer. The Arabic adhan was replaced with the following: {{quote|Tanrı uludur&lt;br /&gt;Şüphesiz bilirim, bildiririm&lt;br /&gt;Tanrı'dan başka yoktur tapacak.&lt;br /&gt;Şüphesiz bilirim, bildiririm;&lt;br /&gt;Tanrı'nın elçisidir Muhammed.&lt;br /&gt;Haydin namaza, haydin felaha,&lt;br /&gt;Namaz uykudan hayırlıdır.}} Following the conclusion of said debates, the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs]] (Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı) released an official mandate on July 18, 1932, announcing the decision to all the mosques across Turkey, and the practice was continued for a period of 18 years. On July 16, 1950, a new government was sworn in, led by [[Adnan Menderes]], which restored Arabic as the [[Sacred language|liturgical language]].

The reformers dismissed the [[imam]] assigned to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, saying that prayer should be performed in a mosque, not in the parliament.&lt;ref name=Hanioglu141&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanioglu|first=Sükrü|title=Ataturk: An Intellectual Biography| year=2011| publisher=Princeton University Press| pages=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also removed the "references to religion" from the decorum. The only Friday sermon ([[khutba]]) ever delivered by a Turkish head of state was given by Atatürk; this took place at a mosque in Balıkesir during the election campaign. The reformers said that "to repeat the sermons [by a politician in the parliament] of a thousand years ago was to preserve backwardness and promote nescience."&lt;ref name=Hanioglu141/&gt;

The abolishment of Caliphate removed the highest religious-political position. This act left the Muslim brotherhoods (Muslim associations working as a society of Muslim believers for any purpose) who were institutionalized (religious-political representation) under the convents and the dervish lodges without higher organizing structure.

The reformers assumed that the original sources, now available in Turkish, would render the orthodox religious establishment (the ‘ulamā’) and the Ṣūfī ṭarīqas obsolete, and thus help to privatize religion as well as produce a reformed Islam (Turkish Reformation = Turkified).&lt;ref name=Hanioglu149&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanioglu|first=Sükrü|title=Ataturk: An Intellectual Biography| year=2011| publisher=Princeton University Press| page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 institutions of religious covenants and dervish lodges were declared illegal.&lt;ref&gt;William Dalrymple: What goes round...

The reformers imagined that the elimination of the orthodox and Ṣūfī religious establishments, along with traditional religious education, and their replacement with a system in which the original sources were available to all in the vernacular language, would pave the way for a new vision of Islam open to progress and modernity and usher in a society guided by modernity.&lt;ref name=Hanioglu150&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanioglu|first=Sükrü|title=Ataturk: An Intellectual Biography|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the multi-party period in 1950 the religious establishments (Islamist movements) returned. The [[Gülen movement]] is a transnational religious and social movement led by Turkish Islamic scholar [[Fethullah Gülen]], which his movement is mainly active in education and interfaith dialogue however there are also substantial investments in media, finance, and for profit health clinics.&lt;ref name="jbwhite"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wJ8S_wG06MEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Abant&amp;f=false Jenny Barbara White, Islamist Mobilization in Turkey: a study in vernacular politics,  University  of Washington Press (2002),  p. 112]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a meeting in the early days of the new republic, Atatürk proclaimed:

{{quote|'''To the women''': ''Win for us the battle of [[education]] and you will do yet more for your country than we have been able to do. It is to you that I appeal''.&lt;br /&gt; '''To the men''': ''If henceforward the women do not share in the social life of the nation, we shall never attain to our full development. We shall remain irremediably backward, incapable of treating on equal terms with the civilizations of the West''.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, Ataturk, The Rebirth of a Nation, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In the following years of Atatürk's Reforms women's rights campaigners in Turkey differed from their sisters (and sympathetic brothers) in other countries. Rather than fighting directly for their basic rights and equality, they saw their best chance in the promotion and maintenance of Atatürk's Reforms, with its espousal of secular values and equality for all, including women.&lt;ref&gt;Nüket Kardam "Turkey's Engagement With Global Women's Human Rights" page 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Equal participation ====
{{See also|Women in Turkish politics}}
The Ottoman society was a traditional one and the women had no political rights, even after the [[Second Constitutional Era]] in 1908. During the early years of the Turkish Republic educated women struggled for political rights. One notable female political activist was [[Nezihe Muhittin]] who founded the first women's party in June 1923, which however was not legalized because the Republic was not officially declared.

With intense struggle, the Turkish women achieved voting rights in local elections by the act of 1580 on 3 April 1930.&lt;ref name="tempo"&gt;''Türkiye'nin 75 yılı'', Tempo Yayıncılık, İstanbul, 1998, p.48,59,250&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, through legislation enacted on 5 December 1934, they gained full universal suffrage, earlier than most other countries.&lt;ref name="tempo"/&gt; The reforms in the Turkish civil code, including those affecting women's suffrage, were "breakthroughs not only within the Islamic world but also in the western world".&lt;ref&gt;Necla Arat in Marvine Howe's ''Turkey today'', page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, in the general elections Eighteen female MP's joined the parliament, at a time when women in a significant number of other European countries [[Timeline of women's suffrage|had no voting rights]].

==== Equality of the sexes ====
{{See also|Polygamy in Turkey}}
Legal equality between the sexes was instituted between 1926–1934 with changes to a multitude of rules and regulations. Women gained many rights for the first time.

Polygamy was permitted in the Ottoman Empire under special circumstances, with certain terms and conditions. The reasons behind the sanctions of polygamy were historical and circumstantial. Atatürk's reforms made polygamy illegal, and became the only nation located in the Middle East that has abolished polygamy, which was officially criminalized with the adoption of the Turkish Civil Code in 1926, a milestone in Atatürk's reforms. Penalties for illegal polygamy set up to 2 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/6872/preview Turkish Penal Code, Art. 230]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Islamic law, a woman's inheritance was half the share of a man where as under the new laws man and women inherited equally.&lt;ref name="atakay"/&gt;

Besides the advancements, men were still officially heads of the household in the law. Women needed the head of the household's permission to travel abroad.&lt;ref name="atakay"/&gt;

==== Equality at the workplace ====
Atatürk's Reforms aimed to break the traditional role of the women in the society. 
Between 1920 and 1938, ten percent of all university graduates were women.&lt;ref name="atakay"/&gt;

In the workplace; In 1930, first female judges were appointed.&lt;ref name="atakay"&gt;Eylem Atakav "Women and Turkish Cinema: Gender Politics, Cultural Identity and Representation, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Empire was a religious empire in which each religious community enjoyed a large degree of autonomy with the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)]] structure. Each millet had an internal system of governance based upon its religious law, such as [[Sharia]], [[catholicism|Catholic]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]], or [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Halakha]]. The Ottoman Empire tried to modernize the code with the reforms of 1839 [[Hatt-i Sharif]] which tried to end the confusion in the judicial sphere by extending the legal equality to all citizens.

The leading legal reforms instituted included a secular [[Constitution of Turkey|constitution]] ([[laïcité]]) with the complete [[Separation of church and state|separation of government and religious affairs]], the replacement of [[Islamic]] courts and [[Sharia|Islamic canon law]] with a [[secular]] civil code based on the [[Swiss Civil Code]], and a penal code based on that of [[Italy]] (1924–37).

On 8 April 1924, [[sharia]] courts were abolished with the law "Mehakim-i Şer'iyenin İlgasına ve Mehakim Teşkilatına Ait Ahkamı Muaddil Kanun".&lt;ref name="Hanioglu2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

=== Codification ===
The non-Muslim millet affected with the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe modernized the Christian Law. In the Ottoman Empire, Islamic Law and Christian Law became drastically different. In 1920, and today, the [[Islamic Law]] does not contain provisions regulating the sundry relationships of "political institutions" and "commercial transactions".&lt;ref name="TIMUR"&gt;Timur, Hıfzı. 1956. "The Place of Islamic Law in Turkish Law Reform", ''Annales de la Faculté de Droit d'Istanbul''. Istanbul: Fakülteler Matbaası.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman Empire dissolved not only because of its outdated systems, but also its traditions were not applicable to the demands of its time. For example, the rules relating to "criminal cases" which were shaped under [[Islamic Law]] were limited in serving their purpose adequately.&lt;ref name="TIMUR"/&gt; Beginning with the 19th century, the Ottoman Islamic codes and legal provisions generally were impracticable in dealing with the wider concept of social systems. In 1841 a criminal code was drawn up in the Ottoman Empire. When the Empire dissolved, there was still no legislation with regard to family and marital relationships.&lt;ref name="TIMUR"/&gt;  Polygamy has not been practiced by law-abiding citizens of Turkey after Atatürk's reforms, in contrast to the former rules of the [[Megelle]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ayfer Altay "Difficulties Encountered in the Translation of Legal Texts: The Case of Turkey", ''Translation Journal'' volume 6, No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; There were thousands of articles in the [[Megelle]] which were not used due to their inapplicability.

==== Civil code ====
{{See also|Mecelle|Swiss Civil Code}}
The adaptation of laws relating to family and marital relationships is an important step which is attributed to Mustafa Kemal. The reforms also instituted legal equality and full political rights for both sexes December 5, 1934, well before [[Timeline of women's suffrage|several other European nations]].

==== Penal code ====

A penal code based on that of Italy (original one codified in 1865) passed between 1924–37.

{{See also|Education in Turkey}}
[[Educational system]]s (schooling) involve institutionalized teaching and learning in relation to a curriculum, which was established according to a predetermined purpose of education. The Ottoman schools were a complex "educational system" based on (differentiated) mainly on religion, established with different curricula for each path. The Ottoman educational system had three main educational groups of institutions. The most common institutions were [[medrese]]s based on [[Arabic language|Arabic]], teaching the [[Quran]] and using the method of memorization. The second type of institution was idadî and sultanî, which were the reformist schools of the [[Tanzimat]] era. The last group included colleges and minority schools in foreign languages that used the latest teaching models in educating their pupils.

The unification of education, along with the closure of the old-style universities, and a large-scale program of science transfer from Europe; education became an integrative system, aimed to alleviate poverty and used [[female education]] to establish [[gender equality]]. Turkish education became a state-supervised system, which was designed to create a skill base for the social and economic progress of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Özelli, ''The Evolution of the Formal Educational System and Its Relation to Economic Growth Policies in the First Turkish Republic'', 77–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Atatürk's reforms on education made education much more accessible: between 1923 and 1938, the number of students attending primary schools increased by 224% from 342,000 to 765,000, the number of students attending middle schools increased by 12.5 times, from around 6,000 to 74,000 and the number of students attending high schools increased by almost 17 times, from 1,200 to 21,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kapluhan|first=Erol|year=2011|title=Türkiye Cumhuriyeti'nde Atatürk Dönemi Eğitim Politikaları (1923–1938) ve Coğrafya Eğitimi|url=|accessdate=|publisher=[[Marmara University]]|type=PhD thesis|language=Turkish|pages=203–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New system (Unification)===
Unification came with the Law on Unification of National Education, which introduced three regulations.&lt;ref name="education"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meb.gov.tr/Stats/apk2001ing/Section_3/1TransformationMotivated.htm |title=Education since republic |publisher=Ministry of National Education (Turkey) |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720184811/http://www.meb.gov.tr/Stats/apk2001ing/Section_3/1TransformationMotivated.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coeducation and the education of  girls ===
In 1915, during the Ottoman period, a separate section for girl students named the ''İnas Darülfünunu'' was opened as a branch of the ''İstanbul Darülfünunu'', the predecessor of the modern Istanbul University.

Atatürk was a strong supporter of [[coeducation]] and the education of girls. Coeducation was established as the norm throughout the educational system by 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, ''Atatürk and the Modernization of Turkey'', 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries of sex segregation under Ottoman rule had denied girls equal education, Atatürk thus opposed segregated education as a matter of principle. The matter of coeducation was first raised as a result of a controversy in [[Tekirdağ]] in 1924, where, due to the lack of a high school for girls, girls requested enrollment in the high school for boys. Upon this, works on coeducation began and the Minister of Education declared that both sexes would follow the same curriculum. In August 1924, it was decided that coeducation would be introduced to primary education, giving boys the right to enroll in girls' high schools and vice versa. Atatürk declared in his [[Kastamonu speech]] in 1925 that coeducation should be the norm. Whilst the educational committee had agreed in 1926 to abolish single-sex education in middle schools that were not boarding schools, segregation persisted in middle and high schools, and statistics in the 1927–28 educational year revealed that only 29% of those enrolled in primary schools were girls. This figure was 18.9% for middle schools and 28% for high schools. Acting on these figures, 70 single-sex middle schools were converted to coeducational schools in 1927–28 and new coeducational middle schools were established. This was despite the opposition of [[Mehmet Fuat Köprülü|Köprülüzade Fuat Bey]], the Undersecretary for Education. Whilst the policy was transition to coeducational high schools based on the success in middle schools from 1928–29 onwards this policy could only be implemented effectively from 1934–35 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kapluhan|first=Erol|year=2011|title=Türkiye Cumhuriyeti'nde Atatürk Dönemi Eğitim Politikaları (1923–1938) ve Coğrafya Eğitimi|url=|accessdate=|publisher=[[Marmara University]]|type=PhD thesis|language=Turkish|pages=232–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher education ===
One of the cornerstone of educational institutions, the [[University of Istanbul]], accepted [[Germany|German]] and [[Austria]]n scientists whom the National Socialist regime in Germany had considered 'racially' or politically undesirable. This political decision (accepting the German and Austrian scientists) established the nucleus of science and modern [higher education] institutions in Turkey.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; The reform aimed to break away the traditional dependency [since the Ottoman Empire]  on the transfer of science and technology by foreign experts.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;

=== Religious education ===
First, all [[medrese]]s and schools administered by private foundations or the [[Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı]] (Presidency for Religious Affairs) were connected to the Ministry of National Education.

Second, the money allocated to schools and medreses from the budget of the Diyanet was transferred to the education budget.

Third, the Ministry of Education had to open a religious faculty for training higher religious experts within the system of higher education, and separate schools for training imams and hatips.

=== Improving literacy ===
The literacy movement aimed [[adult education]] for the goal of forming a [[Skill (labor)|skill base]] in the country. Turkish women were taught not only child care, dress-making and household management, but also skills needed to join the economy outside the home.

==== New alphabet ====
The adoption of the [[Latin script]] and the purging of foreign loan words was part of Atatürk's program of modernization.&lt;ref name="nafi"&gt;Nafi Yalın. ''The Turkish language reform: a unique case of language planning in the world'', Bilim dergisi 2002 Vol.&amp;nbsp;3 page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The two important features were sought, which were the democratization and activate secularism.

Turkish had been written using [[Ottoman Turkish script|a Turkish form]] of the [[Perso-Arabic script]] for a thousand years. It was well suited to write the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] vocabulary that incorporated a great deal of Arabic and Persian vocabulary and even grammar. However, it was poorly suited for the core Turkish grammar and vocabulary, which was rich in vowels and poorly represented by Arabic script, an [[abjad]] which by definition only transcribed consonants. It was thus inadequate at representing Turkish phonemes. Some could be expressed using four different Arabic signs; others could not be expressed at all. The introduction of the telegraph and printing press in the 19th century exposed further weaknesses in the Arabic script.&lt;ref name="Zürcher-188"&gt;[[Erik-Jan Zürcher|Zürcher, Erik Jan]]. ''Turkey: a modern history'', p. 188. I.B.Tauris, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-85043-399-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the Latin script had been proposed before. In 1862, during [[Tanzimat]], the statesman Münuf Pasha advocated a reform of the alphabet. At the start of the 20th century, similar proposals were made by several writers associated with the [[Young Turks]] movement, including Hüseyin Cahit, [[Abdullah Cevdet]], and Celâl Nuri.&lt;ref name="Zürcher-188" /&gt; The issue was raised again in 1923 during the first Economic Congress of the newly founded Turkish Republic, sparking a public debate that was to continue for several years. Some suggested that a better alternative might be to modify the Arabic script to introduce extra characters to better represent Turkish vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Gürçağlar, Şehnaz Tahir. ''The politics and poetics of translation in Turkey, 1923–1960'', pp.&amp;nbsp;53–54. Rodopi, 2008. {{ISBN|978-90-420-2329-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A language commission was responsible for adapting the Latin script to meet the phonetic requirements of the Turkish language was established. The resulting Latin script was designed to reflect the actual sounds of spoken Turkish, rather than simply transcribing the old Ottoman script into a new form.&lt;ref name="Zürcher-189"&gt;Zürcher, p.&amp;nbsp;189&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkish alphabet|current 29-letter Turkish alphabet]] was established. The script was founded by an Armenian, [[Agop Dilaçar|Hagop Martayan Dilaçar]]. Appreciating his contribution, Atatürk suggested him the surname Dilaçar (literally meaning language opener), which he gladly accepted. It was a key step in the cultural part of Atatürk's Reforms.&lt;ref&gt;''Yazım Kılavuzu'', Dil Derneği, 2002 (the writing guide of the Turkish language)&lt;/ref&gt; The Language Commission (''Dil Encümeni'') consisting of the following members:

Atatürk himself was personally involved with the commission and proclaimed an "alphabet mobilisation" to publicise the changes. In 1926 the Turkic republics of the [[Soviet Union]] adopted the Latin script, giving a major boost to reformers in Turkey.&lt;ref name="Zürcher-188" /&gt; On 1&amp;nbsp;November 1928, the new [[Turkish alphabet]] was introduced by the ''Language Commission'' at the initiative of Atatürk, replacing the previously used Perso-Arabic script. The Language Commission proposed a five-year transition period; Atatürk saw this as far too long and reduced it to three months.&lt;ref&gt;Gürçağlar, p.&amp;nbsp;55&lt;/ref&gt; The change was formalized by the Turkish Republic's law number 1353, the ''Law on the Adoption and Implementation of the Turkish Alphabet'',&lt;ref name=kanun1353&gt;{{cite web|title= Tūrk Harflerinin Kabul ve Tatbiki Hakkında Kanun|language= Turkish|url= http://www.idealhukuk.com/hukuk/hukuk.asp?mct=mevzuatdetay&amp;x=kanun&amp;y=Kanunlar&amp;id=910&amp;h=t&amp;tit=T%C3%9CRK%20HARFLER%C4%B0N%C4%B0N%20KABUL%20VE%20TATB%C4%B0K%C4%B0%20HAKKINDA%20KANUN|df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed on 1 November 1928. The law went into effect from 1 January 1929, making the use of the new alphabet compulsory in all public communications.&lt;ref name="Zürcher-189" /&gt;

The removal of Arabic script was defended on the ground that it was not appropriate for the authentic [[Turkish phonology]], which needs a new set of symbols to be correctly represented.&lt;ref name="nafi"/&gt;

==== Literacy drive (Millet Mektepleri) ====
Before the adoption of the new alphabet a pilot program had been established with 3304 class units around Turkey, awarding a total of 64,302 certificates. This program was declared to be unsuccessful and a new organization was proposed which would be used in the drive to introduce the new alphabet.&lt;ref name=bozkurt&gt;[http://deu.mitosweb.com/browse/47125/07-%2520ibrahim%2520Bozkurt.pdf İbrahim Bozkurt, Birgül Bozkurt, '''Yeni Alfabenin Kabülü Sonrası Mersin’de Açılan Millet Mektepleri ve Çalışmaları''', ''Çağdaş Türkiye Araştırmaları Dergisi, Cilt: VIII, Sayı: 18–19, Yıl: 2009, Bahar-Güz'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408223602/http://deu.mitosweb.com/browse/47125/07-%20ibrahim%20Bozkurt.pdf |date=April 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the new organization which would be used in the literacy drive was "[[Millet mektepleri]]".

National Education Minister [[Mustafa Necati]] Bey passed the "National Schools Directive" (Directive) 7284 dated 11 November 1928, which stated that every Turkish citizen ''between the ages of 16–30'' (only primary education had been made mandatory at the time) had to join the Millet Mektepleri and this was mandatory. It was also noted that it would be in two stages. Atatürk became the General Chairman of the initial (group I) schools and became the "principal tutor" of 52 schools (teacher training schools) around the country, teaching, course requirements, the money for the provision of classrooms, the use of the media for propaganda purposes, the documents of those schools were successfully established.&lt;ref name=bozkurt/&gt; The active encouragement of people by Atatürk himself, with many trips to the countryside teaching the new alphabet, was successful, which lead to the second stage.

In the first year of the second stage (1928), 20,487 classrooms were opened; 1,075,500 people attended these schools, but only 597,010 received the final certificate. Due to the global economic crisis ([[Great Depression]]) there was insufficient funding and the drive lasted only three years and 1 ½ million certificates were presented. The total population of Turkey in this period was less than 10 million, which included the mandatory primary education age pupils who were not covered by this certificate.&lt;ref name=bozkurt/&gt; Eventually, the education revolution was successful, as the literacy rate rose from 9% to 33% in just 10 years.

==== Copyright law and Press ====
The literacy reform was supported by strengthening the private publishing sector with a new ''Law on Copyrights'' and congresses for discussing the issues of copyright, public education and scientific publishing.

=== New curriculum (Secularization) ===

Another important part of Atatürk's reforms encompassed his emphasis on the Turkish language and history, leading to the establishment of the extremely, if not excessively, prescriptivist linguistic institution, the  [[Turkish Language Association]] and [[Turkish Historical Society]] for research on [[Turkish language]] and [[History of Turkey|history]], during the years 1931–2. Adaptation of technical vocabulary was another step of modernization, which was tried thoroughly. Non-technical Turkish was vernacularized and simplified on the ground that the language of Turkish people should be comprehensible by the people. A good example is the Turkish word "Bilgisayar" (''bilgi'' = "information", ''sayar'' = "counter"), which was adapted for the word "Computer".

The second president of Turkey, [[İsmet İnönü]] explained the reason behind adopting a Latin script: ''"The alphabet reform cannot be attributed to ease of reading and writing. That was the motive of Enver Pasha. For us, the big impact and the benefit of alphabet reform was that it eased the way to cultural reform. We inevitably lost our connection with Arabic culture."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hatıralar|isbn=975-22-0177-6|author=İsmet İnönü|page=223|language=Turkish|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alphabet's introduction has been described by the historian [[Bernard Lewis]] as "not so much practical as [[pedagogy|pedagogical]], as social and cultural – and Mustafa Kemal, in forcing his people to accept it, was slamming a door on the past as well as opening a door to the future." It was accompanied by a systematic effort to rid the Turkish language of Arabic and Persian loanwords, often replacing them with words from Western languages, especially French. Atatürk told his friend Falih Rıfkı Atay, who was on the government's Language Commission, that by carrying out the reform "we were going to cleanse the Turkish mind from its Arabic roots."&lt;ref&gt;Toprak, p. 145, fn. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Yaşar Nabi, a leading pro-Kemalist journalist, argued in the 1960s that the alphabet reform had been vital in creating a new Western-oriented identity for Turkey. He noted that younger Turks, who had only been taught the Latin script, were at ease in understanding Western culture but were quite unable to engage with Middle Eastern culture.&lt;ref&gt;Toprak, p. 145, fn. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The new script was adopted very rapidly and soon gained widespread acceptance. Even so, the Turkish Arabic script nonetheless continued to be used by older people in private correspondence, notes and diaries until well into the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Zürcher-189" /&gt;

It was argued by the ruling Kemalist elites who pushed this reform that the abandonment of the Arabic script was not merely a symbolic expression of secularization by breaking the link to Ottoman Islamic texts to which only a minor group of ulema had access; but also Latin script would make reading and writing easier to learn and consequently improve the literacy rate, which succeeded eventually The change motivated by a specific political goal: to break the link with the Ottoman and Islamic past and to orient the new state of Turkey towards the West and away from the traditional Ottoman lands of the Middle East. He commented on one occasion that the symbolic meaning of the reform was for the Turkish nation to "show with its script and mentality that it is on the side of world civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Karpat, Kemal H. "A Language in Search of a Nation: Turkish in the Nation-State", in ''Studies on Turkish politics and society: selected articles and essays'', p. 457. BRILL, 2004. {{ISBN|978-90-04-13322-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governing ====
The idea of absolute monarchy in the textbooks was replaced by the limited ideology known as liberalism. The teachings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu based republics were added as content.

Şerif Mardin has noted that "Atatürk imposed the mandatory Latin alphabet in order to promote the national awareness of the Turks against a wider Muslim identity. It is also imperative to add that he hoped to relate Turkish nationalism to the modern civilization of Western Europe, which embraced the Latin alphabet."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Güven, İsmail in "Education and Islam in Turkey". ''Education in Turkey'', p. 177. Eds. Nohl, Arnd-Michael; Akkoyunlu-Wigley, Arzu; Wigley, Simon. Waxmann Verlag, 2008. {{ISBN|978-3-8309-2069-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicitly nationalistic and ideological character of the alphabet reform was illustrated by the booklets issued by the government to teach the population the new script. It included sample phrases aimed at discrediting the Ottoman government and instilling updated "Turkish" values, such as: ''"Atatürk allied himself with the nation and drove the sultans out of the homeland"''; ''"Taxes are spent for the common properties of the nation. Tax is a debt we need to pay"''; ''"It is the duty of every Turk to defend the homeland against the enemies."'' The alphabet reform was promoted as redeeming the Turkish people from the neglect of the Ottoman rulers: ''"Sultans did not think of the public, Ghazi commander [Atatürk] saved the nation from enemies and slavery. And now, he declared a campaign against ignorance. He armed the nation with the new Turkish alphabet."'' &lt;ref&gt;Güven, pp. 180–81&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The pursuit of state-controlled economic policies by Atatürk and [[İsmet İnönü]] was guided by a national vision: they wanted to knit the country together, eliminate foreign control of the economy, and improve communications. [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], a trading port with international foreign enterprises, was abandoned and resources were channeled to other, less-developed cities, in order to establish a more balanced development throughout the country.&lt;ref name=mango470&gt;Mango, ''Atatürk'', 470&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===

==== Land reform ====
{{See also|Land reform}}
[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)]] is the title given to tribal chieftains, either supreme chieftains, or to village heads, who were wealthy landlords and owners of major real estates in the urban centers, although these landlords are usually with heavy tribal relations.

Throughout the mid-1930s through the mid-1940s, culminating in the reform Law of 1945.  Implementation results, the troubles met at implementations of Law No 4753 Getting Farmer to be Landowner (1945), law that implement agrarian reform in Turkey and the works of the implementing institution General Directorate of Agrarian Reform was not effect full. However, attempts to reform the Ottoman system of  [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|feudalism]] ({{lang-tr|Ağalık}}) were less well received. Partly because the ideas behind this land reform was not adequately understood, and there were a number of controversial and often contradictory interpretations.

==== Establishing model farms ====
The [[Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock (Turkey)|Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock]] was established in 1924. The ministry promoted farming through establishing [[model farm]]s. One of these farms later became a public recreational area to serve the capital, known as the [[Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo]].

=== Industry ===

The development of industry was promoted by strategies such as import substitution and the founding of state enterprises and state banks.&lt;ref name="science"/&gt; 
Economic reforms included the establishment of many state-owned factories throughout the country for the agriculture, machine making and textile industries.

Many of these grew into successful enterprises and were [[Privatization|privatized]] during the latter part of 20th century.

==== Nationalization ====
[[Turkish tobacco]] was an important industrial crop, while its cultivation and manufacture were French monopolies under [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]]. The tobacco and cigarette trade was controlled by two French companies, the [[Regie Company]] and [[Narquileh tobacco]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', 232–233.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman Empire gave the tobacco monopoly to the [[Ottoman Bank]] as a limited company under the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|Council of the Public Debt]]. Regie, as part of the Council of the Public Debt, had control over production, storing, and distribution (including export) with an unchallenged price control. Turkish farmers were dependent on Regie for their livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm|title=Tütün, İçki ve Tekel|language=Turkish|date=29 January 2003|accessdate=10 October 2007|last=Aysu|first=Abdullah|publisher=BİA Haber Merkezi|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015212242/http://bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm|archivedate=15 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, this company was taken over by the state and named [[Tekel]].

The development of a national [[Rail transport|rail network]] as another important step for industrialization. The railway network was operated by foreign companies. The State Railways of the Republic of Turkey ([[Turkish State Railways]]) was formed on May 31, 1927. TCDD took over the [[Chemin de fer d'Anatolie-Baghdad]] (Anatolian Railway (CFOA)). on June 1, 1927 had control over the tracks of the former Anatolian Railway (CFOA) and the Transcaucasus Railway line in Turkish borders. This institution developed an extensive railway network in a very short time. In 1927, the integration of road construction goals into development plans. The road network consisted of 13,885&amp;nbsp;km of ruined surface roads, 4.450&amp;nbsp;km of stabilized roads, and 94 bridges. In 1935, a new entity was established under the government called "Sose ve Kopruler Reisligi" which would drive development of new roads after World War II. However, in 1937, the 22,000&amp;nbsp;km of roads in Turkey augmented the railways.

=== Finance  ===

==== Establishing the banking system ====
In 1924, the first Turkish bank [[Türkiye İş Bankası]] was established. The bank's creation was a response to the growing need for a truly national establishment and the birth of a banking system which was capable of backing up economic activities, managing funds accumulated as a result of policies providing savings incentives and, where necessary, extending resources which could trigger industrial impetus.

In 1931, the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]] was realized. The bank's primary purpose was to have control over the exchange rate, and [[Ottoman Bank]]'s role during its initial years as a central bank was phased out. Later specialized banks such as the [[Sümerbank]] (1932) and the [[Etibank]] (1935) were founded.

==== International debt/capitulations ====
{{see also|Ottoman Public Debt Administration|Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire}}
The [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]] (OPDA) was a European-controlled organization that was established in 1881 to collect the payments which the Ottoman Empire owed to European companies in the [[Ottoman public debt]]. The OPDA became a vast, essentially independent bureaucracy within the Ottoman bureaucracy, run by the creditors. It employed 5,000 officials who collected taxes that were then turned over to the European creditors.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Quataert, ''"The Ottoman Empire, 1700–1922"'' (published in 2000.)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]] ([[ahdname]]s) were generally bilateral acts whereby definite arrangements were entered into by each contracting party towards the other, not mere concessions, grants made by successive [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultans]] to [[Christendom|Christian nation]]s, conferring rights and privileges in favor of their subjects (Christians/Minorities) resident or trading in the Ottoman dominions, to establish the policy towards European states.

Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire removed by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923), specifically by Article 28. During the Paris Conference of 1925, Reformer's paid 62% of the Ottoman Empire's pre-1912 debt, and 77% of the Ottoman Empire's post-1912 debt. With the Paris Treaty of 1933, Turkey decreased this amount to its favor and agreed to pay 84.6 million liras out of the remaining total of 161.3 million liras of Ottoman debt. The last payment of the Ottoman debt was made by Turkey on 25 May 1954.

== Analysis ==

=== Arguments over origin ===
The reforms were guided by educational and scientific progress, and based on the principles of [[positivism|positivist]] and [[rationalism|rationalist]] [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]. Members of [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]], mostly graduates of the 'modern schools' that were established during [[Tanzimat]] era, applied their western-inspired modernization to all areas of government.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;Regine ERICHSEN, «Scientific Research and Science Policy in Turkey», in Cemoti, n° 25 – Les Ouïgours au vingtième siècle, [En ligne], mis en ligne le 5 décembre 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments over effectiveness ===
Some people thought that the pace of change under Atatürk was too rapid as, in his quest to modernize Turkey, he effectively abolished centuries-old traditions. Nevertheless, the bulk of the population willingly accepted the reforms, even though some were seen as reflecting the views of the urban elites at the expense of the generally illiterate inhabitants of the rural countryside, where religious sentiments and customary norms tended to be stronger.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, p.&amp;nbsp;503.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most controversial area of reform was that of religion. The policy of state secularism ("active neutrality") met with opposition at the time and it continues to generate a considerable degree of social and political tension. However, any political movement that attempts to harness religious sentiment at the expense of Turkish secularism is likely to face the opposition of the armed forces, which has always regarded itself as the principal and most faithful guardian of secularism. Some assert that a historical example is the case of Prime Minister [[Adnan Menderes]], who was overthrown by the military in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, p.&amp;nbsp;504.&lt;/ref&gt; He and two of his Ministers were hanged by the Military Tribunal. However, their charges were not for being anti-secular. Although Menderes did relax some restrictions on religion he also banned the [[millet party]] which was avowedly Islamist. Further, the charges at the Military Tribunal did not involve antisecular activities and it can be concluded that Menderes was overall in favour of the secular system.

==== Position among civilizations ====
In contrast to territorial delineation, the American political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]], consider what is "Western" based on industry, technology, law, politics, economics, lifestyle, diet, language, alphabet, religion, philosophy, and values. World's major civilizations — identifying seven, and a possible eighth: (i) Western, (ii) Latin American, (iii) Islamic, (iv) Sinic (Chinese), (v) Hindu, (vi) Orthodox, (vii) Japanese, and (viii) the African.  Huntington very expressly assigns Turkey to its own category. Although geographically only 3% of Turkey lies in Europe, Turkey has a similar economic system, has a customs union with the European Union in addition to being an official candidate for membership, and is a member of typical Western organisations such as OECD, Council of Europe, and NATO. It is usually a member of European organisations for sports and cultural events such as UEFA and the Eurovision Song Contest.

=== Arguments over reform or revolution===

The Turkish name for Atatürk's Reforms literally means "Atatürk's Revolutions", as, strictly speaking, the changes were too profound to be described as mere 'reforms'. It also reflects the belief that those changes, implemented as they were during the [[Single-Party Period of Republic of Turkey|Single-Party period]], were more in keeping with the attitudes of the country's progressive elite than with a general populace accustomed to centuries of Ottoman stability – an attempt to convince a people so-conditioned of the merits of such far-reaching changes would test the political courage of any government subject to multi-party conditions.

=== Military and the republic ===

Not only were all the social institutions of Turkish society reorganized, but the social and political values of the state were replaced as well.&lt;ref name="military"&gt;Ali Arslan "The evaluation of parliamentary democracy in turkey and Turkish political elites" HAOL, núm. 6 (invierno, 2005), 131–141.&lt;/ref&gt; This new, secular state ideology was to become known as [[Kemalism]], and it is the basis of the democratic Turkish republic. Since the establishment of the republic the Turkish military has perceived itself as the guardian of Kemalism, and it has intervened in Turkish politics to that end on several occasions, including the overthrow of civilian governments by [[coup d'état]]. While this may seem contrary to democratic ideals, it was argued by military authorities and secularists as necessary in the light of Turkish history, ongoing efforts to maintain secular government, and the fact that the reforms were implemented [[interwar period|at a time]] when the military occupied 16.9% of the professional job positions (the corresponding figure today is only 3%).&lt;ref name="military"/&gt;

The '''Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party''' was an Australian political party from 2013 to 2017. [[Ricky Muir]] held a seat for the party in the [[Australian Senate]] from 2013 to 2016.

==History==
The Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party (AMEP) was formed on 11 May 2013 in Queensland at a public meeting of motoring enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/about |title=AMEP - About |accessdate=4 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822051526/http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/about |archivedate=22 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the party followed moves by state governments, particularly in Queensland, to toughen anti-[[hooning]] and vehicle impoundment legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/australian_motoring_enthusiast_party_forms |accessdate=4 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226222150/http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/australian_motoring_enthusiast_party_forms |title=Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party Forms |archivedate=26 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Electoral Commission completed the registration of the AMEP on 9 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/files/aust-motoring.pdf|format=PDF|title=Register Of Political Parties : The Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party|publisher=Aec.gov.au|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and structure==
The AMEP's structure includes State Councils and a Central Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/constitution |accessdate=4 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213205834/http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/constitution |title= The Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party Constitution - April 2013 |archivedate=13 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queensland State Council and the Central Executive were formed when the party was established on 11 May 2013. At that point the Central Executive was made up of the Queensland State Council's office bearers.

The first Annual General Meeting of the AMEP was held on 11 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/agm_2013 |accessdate=4 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014175138/http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/agm_2013 |title=AMEP Annual General Meeting 2013 |archivedate=14 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queensland State Council office bearers were returned as the Central Executive's office bearers.

The Victorian State Council was formed on 17 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/victorian_state_council_of_amep_established |accessdate=4 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228072034/http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/victorian_state_council_of_amep_established |title=Victorian State Council of AMEP Established |author=Scott McDonald |archivedate=28 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Australian State Council was formed on 23 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/western_australian_state_council_established |accessdate=4 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726223934/http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/western_australian_state_council_established |title=Western Australian State Council Established |date=25 July 2013 |archivedate=26 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The New South Wales State Council was formed on 7 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/new_south_wales_state_council_established |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818125457/http://www.australianmotoringenthusiastparty.org.au/new_south_wales_state_council_established |title=New South Wales State Council Established |author=Matthew Midson |date=8 August 2013 |archivedate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victorian State Council was suspended by the party's executive in October 2013 over claims that it had set up a [[Facebook]] page without permission and had engaged in what ABC News reported as being labelled "illegal and unauthorised use of AMEP identification, confidential information, incorrect policy announcements, and the misuse of the party brand".  The former chairman of the Victorian State Council, Scott McDonald, told the ABC that it was unclear why the action had been taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Caldwell |first=Alison |title=Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party closes Victorian branch over 'blatant disregard' for national executive |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-07/amep-shuts-victorian-branch-ricky-muir/5003480 |accessdate=9 October 2013 |newspaper=ABC News |date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ricky Muir]] represented AMEP in Victoria and won a seat in the senate after preference distribution from a record-low primary vote of 0.51 percent or 17,122 first preferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/results/senate/vic/ |title=Senate Results: Victoria |work=ABC News |accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-01/motoring-enthusiast-ricky-muir-wins-a-seat-in-australian-senate/4991882|title=Motoring Enthusiasts Party member Ricky Muir wins Senate seat |work=ABC News |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2013/09/the-preference-deals-behind-the-strange-election-of-ricky-muir-and-wayne-dropulich-.html |title=Antony Green's Election Blog |publisher=Blogs.abc.net.au |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he assumed his seat on 1 July 2014.

On 10 October 2013 Muir announced he would enter into an alliance with the [[Palmer United Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-10/clive-palmer-joins-forces-with-motoring-enthusiast-ricky-muir-i/5013556 |title=Clive Palmer issues warning to Government as Motoring Enthusiast Ricky Muir joins Senate voting bloc |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muir's senior adviser was electoral consultant [[Glenn Druery]], but he was sacked by Muir less than a month later and was escorted out of Parliament.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1626">'''Aversive agents''' are unpleasantly flavored substances added to poisonous [[household goods]] in order to discourage [[children]] and animals from consuming the poisonous household products. Aversive agents are not intended to be harmful, only unpleasant. For example, to prevent children from consuming poisonous [[anti-freeze]], which has a [[sweet]] flavor due to the [[ethylene glycol]], an aversive agent is added, which gives the anti-freeze an unpleasant taste. There are two primary classes of aversive agents: [[bitterant]]s, chemicals producing a bitter flavor, and [[pungent agents]], chemicals producing an unpleasantly [[pungent]] flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Final Report Study of Aversive Agents |booktitle= |pages= |publisher=Consumer Product Safety Commission United States of America |date=18 November 1992 |location= |url=http://www.cpsc.gov/LIBRARY/FOIA/foia99/os/aversive.pdf |doi= |id= |accessdate=15 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616104140/http://www.cpsc.gov/LIBRARY/FOIA/foia99/os/aversive.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bloc Québécois (BQ)''' ({{IPA-fr|blɔk kebekwa}}) is a [[list of federal political parties in Canada|federal political party]] in [[Canada]] devoted to [[Quebec nationalism]] and the promotion of [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereignty]]. The Bloc was formed by [[Members of Parliament]] who defected from the federal [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] and [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] during the collapse of the [[Meech Lake Accord]]. Founder [[Lucien Bouchard]] was a cabinet minister in the federal Progressive Conservative government of [[Brian Mulroney]].

The party seeks to create the conditions necessary for the political secession of [[Quebec]] from Canada and campaigns actively only within the province during federal elections.  The party has been described as [[Social democracy|social democratic]]&lt;ref&gt;The BQ is described as social-democratic:

The Bloc was the largest party in Quebec, and either the second or third largest party in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], for seven straight federal elections, from the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]] until 2011.  The [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 election]] saw the party win just four seats and lose [[official party status]] after a wave of support for the [[New Democratic Party]].  By 2014 the party had been reduced to two seats because of resignations and expulsions.  In the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 federal election]], the Bloc won 10 seats in the House of Commons, even though the party's leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] failed to win a seat.

The Bloc has strong informal ties to the [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ, whose members are known as ''{{lang|fr|Péquistes}}''), a provincial party that advocates for the secession of Quebec from Canada and its independence, but the two are not linked organizationally. As with its provincial counterpart, the Bloc Québécois has been supported by a wide range of voters in Quebec, from sections of [[labour movement|organized labour]] to more [[Conservatism in Canada|conservative]] rural voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boisclair gets emotional talking about homophobia |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20070304/que_vote_070304/ |accessdate=30 December 2011 |publisher=[[CTV News]] |date=4 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329062646/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20070304/que_vote_070304/ |archivedate=29 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Results suggest rift between urban, rural voters|url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canadavotes2006/national/2006/01/24/urban-rural-060124.html|accessdate=14 May 2013|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=24 January 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806144455/http://www.cbc.ca/story/canadavotes2006/national/2006/01/24/urban-rural-060124.html|archivedate=6 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members and supporters are known in French as ''{{lang|fr|Bloquistes}}'' ({{IPA-fr|blɔkist|pron}}).

==History==

===Origins===
The Bloc Québécois was formed in 1991 as an informal coalition of Progressive Conservative and Liberal Members of Parliament from Quebec, who left their original parties around the time of the defeat of the [[Meech Lake Accord]]. The party was intended to be temporary and was given the goal of the promotion of sovereignty at the federal level. The party aimed to disband following a successful [[referendum]] on secession from Canada. As with most parties, it has gained and lost prominent supporters over the years.&lt;ref name="through the years" /&gt;

The initial coalition that led to the Bloc was headed by Lucien Bouchard, who had been federal [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]] in the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney.&lt;ref name="through the years"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Bloc Québécois through the years|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/the-bloc-qubcois-through-the-years/article2008919/?service=mobile|accessdate=13 May 2011|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=3 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508060618/http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/the-bloc-qubcois-through-the-years/article2008919/?service=mobile|archivedate=8 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bouchard abandoned the government in May 1990 in response to the report of a commission headed by [[Jean Charest]] that suggested changes to the Meech Lake Accord. Bouchard felt the recommendations for change undermined the objectives and spirit of the accord. According to ''[[The Secret Mulroney Tapes]]'' he was fired by Prime Minister Mulroney. Bouchard was joined by five of his fellow Tories ([[Nic Leblanc]], [[Louis Plamondon]], [[Benoît Tremblay]], [[Gilbert Chartrand]], and [[François Gérin]]), along with two Liberals ([[Gilles Rocheleau]] and [[Jean Lapierre]]). The first Bloquiste candidate to be elected was [[Gilles Duceppe]], then a union organizer, in a [[by-election]] for the [[Montreal]] [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Laurier—Sainte-Marie]] on 13 August 1990.&lt;ref name="through the years"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DUCEPPE, Gilles|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=ed3d4160-8a5a-4efc-a0a6-d65deeb994d9&amp;Language=E&amp;Section=FederalExperience|publisher=[[Parliament of Canada]]|accessdate=13 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228190447/http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=ed3d4160-8a5a-4efc-a0a6-d65deeb994d9&amp;Language=E&amp;Section=FederalExperience|archivedate=28 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran as an independent, since the Bloc had not been registered as a federal party. [[Jean Lapierre]] renounced separatism and rejoined the Liberals during the leadership of [[Paul Martin]].

===First election===
[[File:Bloc Quebecois 1990s.svg|thumb|300px|Logo of the Bloc Québécois in the 1990s to 2000s]]
In the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]], the Bloc won 54 seats (out of 75) in Quebec, sweeping nearly all of the francophone ridings. Because the opposition vote in the rest of Canada was split between the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]], the Progressive Conservative Party, and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], the Bloc narrowly won the second largest number of seats in the House of Commons, and therefore became the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|official opposition]]. While Reform finished second in the national popular vote, the Bloc's heavy concentration of support in Quebec was slightly larger than Reform's concentration in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bloc Québécois forms the Opposition in 1993 election|url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/Digital+Archives/Politics/Federal+Politics/ID/1632493560/?page=6|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Digital Archives|date=26 October 1993|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219092100/http://www.cbc.ca/player/Digital+Archives/Politics/Federal+Politics/ID/1632493560/?page=6|archivedate=19 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the new Parliament was sworn in, Bouchard announced that Bloquiste MPs would only speak French on the floor of the House of Commons, a policy that remains in force to this day.  This was out of necessity; although Bouchard and most of the Bloc's founding members were fluently bilingual in French and English, Bouchard had discovered that most of his large caucus could not speak English well enough to use it in debate.

The election of such a relatively large number of Bloquistes was the first of [[The Three Periods]], a plan intended to lay out the way to sovereignty created by PQ leader [[Jacques Parizeau]]. Parizeau became [[Premier of Quebec]] in the [[Quebec general election, 1994|Quebec election of 1994]] (the second of the ''Three Periods'').

Because the Bloc was the official opposition, it had considerable privileges over the other parties although all of its MPs had been elected in one province.  For instance, [[Question Period]]s during the 35th Parliament were dominated by issues of national unity.  However, the governing Liberals regarded Reform as their main opposition on non-Quebec matters.  Also, in 1995, when Bouchard garnered an invitation to meet visiting US President [[Bill Clinton]] by virtue of being Opposition Leader, Reform leader [[Preston Manning]] was also given a meeting with Clinton in order to defuse Bouchard's separatist leverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WARREN CARAGATA in Ottawa with CARL MOLLINS in Washington |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTM0010399 |title=Clinton Visits Chrétien |publisher=Thecanadianencyclopedia.com |accessdate=9 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428054316/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTM0010399 |archivedate=28 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1995 Quebec referendum===
In 1995, the PQ government called the second [[1995 Quebec referendum|referendum]] on independence in [[History of Quebec|Quebec history]]. The Bloc entered the campaign for the ''Oui'' (Yes) side (in favour of sovereignty). The ''Oui'' side's campaign had a difficult beginning, so the leadership of the campaign was shifted from PQ leader Jacques Parizeau to Bloc leader Lucien Bouchard.  Bouchard was seen as more charismatic and more moderate, and therefore more likely to attract voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 1995 Quebec referendum: Turning the 'Yes' tide|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/federal-politics/separation-anxiety-the-1995-quebec-referendum/turning-the-yes-tide.html|accessdate=14 May 2013|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=30 October 1995|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211091454/http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/federal-politics/separation-anxiety-the-1995-quebec-referendum/turning-the-yes-tide.html|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "tripartite agreement" mapping out the plan for accession to independence was written and signed by the leaders of the Parti Québécois, the Bloc Québécois and the [[Action démocratique du Québec]] on 12 June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1995 Quebec referendum: A "Yes" alliance|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/federal-politics/separation-anxiety-the-1995-quebec-referendum/a-common-front.html|accessdate=14 May 2013|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=12 June 1995|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210231431/http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/federal-politics/separation-anxiety-the-1995-quebec-referendum/a-common-front.html|archivedate=10 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It revived [[René Lévesque]]'s notion that the referendum should be followed by the negotiating of an association agreement between an independent Quebec and the rest of Canada. This provision was inspired by Bouchard. Parizeau had previously wanted a vote simply on independence. The difference became moot when 50.6% of voters taking part in the referendum rejected the sovereignty plan. An overwhelming "Non" vote in Montreal tipped the balance.

The day after the referendum, Parizeau announced his pending resignation as PQ leader and [[Premier of Quebec]]. Bouchard left federal politics and succeeded Parizeau in both posts on 26 January 1996.

===New leaders===
Following Bouchard's departure from Ottawa, [[Michel Gauthier]] became [[Bloc Québécois leadership elections|leader of the Bloc]]. In the wake of the referendum defeat, Gauthier proved unable to hold the fractious caucus together and resigned as leader just one year later. Gilles Duceppe, who had served as interim leader between Bouchard and Gauthier, became leader of the Bloc in 1997 and remained leader up until 2011, resigning after the 2011 federal election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/duceppe-resigns-as-bloc-leader-after-losing-riding/article2007598/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Duceppe resigns as Bloc leader after losing riding | date=24 August 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505112408/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/duceppe-resigns-as-bloc-leader-after-losing-riding/article2007598/ | archivedate=5 May 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/984484--duceppe-resigns-as-bloc-quebecois-drowns-in-an-orange-tsunami?bn=1 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Andrew | last=Chung | title=Duceppe resigns as Bloc Québécois drowns in an orange tsunami | date=3 May 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024031701/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/984484--duceppe-resigns-as-bloc-quebecois-drowns-in-an-orange-tsunami?bn=1 | archivedate=24 October 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilles Duceppe announced on 11 May 2007 that he would run for the leadership of the Parti Québécois to replace [[André Boisclair]], who resigned on 8 May 2007, after the poor performance in the March 2007 [[Quebec general election, 2007|Quebec provincial election]] and internal dissent forced him to step down. Duceppe announced the next day that he was withdrawing from the race, and that he would support [[Pauline Marois]] who had also announced her intention to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duceppe drops out of PQ race|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2007/05/12/duceppe-pq.html|accessdate=8 May 2013|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=12 May 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315002030/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2007/05/12/duceppe-pq.html|archivedate=15 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declining fortunes===
In the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]], the Bloc Québécois dropped to 44 seats, losing official opposition status to the Reform Party. The 1997–2000 term was marked by the Bloc's fight against the passage of the [[Clarity Act]], the attempt by Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] (himself a Quebecer who represented a strongly nationalist riding) and [[Stéphane Dion]], a Quebec minister in Chrétien's cabinet, to codify the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]'s [[Reference Re Secession of Quebec|1998 decision]] that Quebec could not secede unilaterally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dion|first=Stéphane|title=Stéphane Dion: Quebeckers want more clarity than 50% plus one|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/stphane-dion-quebeckers-want-more-clarity-than-50-plus-one/article8329073/|accessdate=8 May 2013|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 election]], the Bloc dropped further to 38 seats, despite polling a larger percentage of the vote than at the previous election. One factor was the [[2000–06 municipal reorganization in Quebec|forced merger of several major Quebec cities]], such as [[Montreal]], [[Quebec City]] and [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]]/[[Gatineau]]. The merger was very unpopular in those areas, resulting in Liberal wins in several of the merged areas. This was still more than the number of seats the Liberals had won in Quebec. However, the Liberals won several subsequent by-elections during the life of the resulting Parliament, until the Liberals had held the majority of Quebec's seats in the Commons for the first time since the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984 federal election]]. From then to the subsequent election, the Bloc continued to denounce the federal government's interventions in what the Bloc saw as exclusively provincial jurisdictions. The Bloc credits its actions for the uncovering of what has since become the [[sponsorship scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal sponsorship scandal|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/groupaction/|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=26 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515152950/http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/groupaction/|archivedate=15 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comeback===
The Bloc continued to slide in most of the 2003 opinion polls following the [[Quebec general election, 2003|2003 Quebec election]] which was won by the federalist [[Quebec Liberal Party]] led by [[Jean Charest]]. However, things changed during the winter of 2003. The federalist Charest government lost popularity. Then, in February 2004, the Auditor General of Canada uncovered the [[Gomery Commission|sponsorship scandal]], suggesting illegality in the spending of federal monies in Quebec in support of Canadian unity. As well, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Jean Chrétien]] passed party financing legislation that resulted in the Bloc receiving millions of dollars in subsidies that helped to stabilize its organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Political contributions: money, money, money|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/cdngovernment/political-contributions.html|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=5 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401043433/http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/cdngovernment/political-contributions.html|archivedate=1 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 election]] the Bloc adopted the slogan ''Un parti propre au Québec'', a play on words that can be translated either as "A party of Quebec's own" ("a party proper to Quebec") or as "A clean party in Quebec". The Bloc won 54 seats in the House of Commons, tying its previous record from the 1993 campaign. For the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 election]], the Bloc used the slogan ''Heureusement, ici, c'est le Bloc!'' ("Fortunately, the Bloc is here!").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloc.org/archivage/depmontreal_english.pdf |title=BQ_DepEthno – anglais |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219011054/http://www.bloc.org/archivage/depmontreal_english.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bloc were expected to easily win more than 60 seats at the start of the campaign, and they did in fact take six seats from the Liberals. However, the unexpected surge of the new [[Conservative Party of Canada]] in parts of Quebec, particularly in and around Quebec City, led to the Bloc losing eight seats to the Tories. Coupled with an additional loss to [[André Arthur]], an independent candidate, the Bloc recorded a net loss of three seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conservatives make breakthrough in Quebec; Bloc wins 51 seats|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/conservatives-make-breakthrough-in-quebec-bloc-wins-51-seats-1.586146|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=24 January 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416201625/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/conservatives-make-breakthrough-in-quebec-bloc-wins-51-seats-1.586146|archivedate=16 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative Party won a plurality (but not a majority) of seats in the House of Commons, thus forming a [[minority government]]. There was persistent speculation as to the possibility of the Bloc forming alliances with other opposition parties to wrest the government away from the Conservatives. Duceppe, whose leadership was confirmed after the election, maintained that the Bloc would continue to co-operate with other opposition parties or with the government when this advantaged Quebec, but would not participate in a federal government.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

On 2 May 2006, a poll revealed that for the first time, the Conservatives were ahead of the Bloc among Quebec voters (34% against 31%){{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. Duceppe announced the Bloc would support [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]]'s budget that same day. By October polls showed that the Bloc was up to mid forties whereas the Conservatives fell into the teens behind Liberals in their poll numbers in Quebec{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.

===Slight gains===
The Bloc made slight gains following the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal elections]] as they won 49 seats, one more than the number they had before the [[39th Canadian Parliament|previous parliament]] was dissolved. In that election, they used the slogan "''{{lang|fr|Présent pour le Québec}}''" ("Present for Quebec"). Although they made small gains in relation to the number of seats at dissolution, they fell by 2 seats to 49 in comparison to the 51 they received in 2006. Also, the proportion of popular votes in the province was down 4 points to 38.1%, the Bloc's lowest score since 1997.

In a speech in front of his supporters following the election, BQ leader Gilles Duceppe claimed to have achieved his objectives, adding: "without the Bloc Québécois tonight, Mr. Harper would have formed a majority government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harper 'very pleased' with stronger minority|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/harper-very-pleased-with-stronger-minority-1.707322|accessdate=2 June 2018|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of November 2008, the Bloc indicated that it would support a [[40th Canadian Parliament#Possible Motion of No Confidence|possible motion of no confidence]] against the governing Conservatives by the two other opposition parties, and would support the resulting Liberal-NDP coalition government at least until June 2010, without actually being part of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liberals, NDP, Bloc sign deal on proposed coalition|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/liberals-ndp-bloc-sign-deal-on-proposed-coalition-1.700119|accessdate=2 June 2018|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coalition attempt===
On 26 March 2011, Bloc Québécois leader Duceppe stated that Conservative leader Stephen Harper had in 2004 tried to form a [[coalition government]] with the Bloc and NDP in response to Harper's allegations that the Liberals intended to form a coalition with the Bloc and the NDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Payton|first=Laura|title=Harper wanted 2004 coalition: Duceppe|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/03/26/cv-kickoff-bloc.html|accessdate=26 March 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=26 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104222524/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/03/26/cv-kickoff-bloc.html|archivedate=4 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after the 2004 federal election, Stephen Harper privately met with BQ leader Gilles Duceppe and New Democratic Party leader [[Jack Layton]] in a Montreal hotel.&lt;ref name=gazetteCoalition/&gt; On 9 September 2004, the three signed a letter addressed to then-[[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]], stating,
{{Quote|We respectfully point out that the opposition parties, who together constitute a majority in the House, have been in close consultation. We believe that, should a request for dissolution arise, this should give you cause, as constitutional practice has determined, to consult the opposition leaders and consider all of your options before exercising your constitutional authority.&lt;ref name=gazetteCoalition&gt;{{cite news|title=Harper, Layton, Duceppe sought 'co-opposition' in 2004 letter to GG |url=http://www.canada.com/news/Harper+Layton+Duceppe+sought+opposition+2004+letter/4511865/story.html#ixzz1Htw6yDVP |publisher=[[Montreal Gazette]] |date=27 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401200203/http://www.canada.com/news/Harper%2BLayton%2BDuceppe%2Bsought%2Bopposition%2B2004%2Bletter/4511865/story.html |archivedate= 1 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the same day the letter was written, the three party leaders held a joint press conference at which they expressed their intent to co-operate on changing parliamentary rules, and to request that the Governor General consult with them before deciding to call an election.&lt;ref name=Harpercoalition&gt;{{cite news|last=Chung|first=Andrew|title=Bloc leader accuses Harper of lying about coalition|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/962240--bloc-leader-accuses-harper-of-lying-about-coalition?bn=1|accessdate=27 March 2011|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=26 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023204043/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/962240--bloc-leader-accuses-harper-of-lying-about-coalition?bn=1|archivedate=23 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the news conference, Harper said: "It is the Parliament that's supposed to run the country, not just the largest party and the single leader of that party. That's a criticism I've had and that we've had and that most Canadians have had for a long, long time now so this is an opportunity to start to change that." However, at the time, Harper and the two other opposition leaders denied trying to form a coalition government, despite the letter written to the Governor General.&lt;ref name=gazetteCoalition/&gt; Harper said, "This is not a coalition, but this is a co-operative effort."&lt;ref name=Harpercoalition/&gt;

One month later, on 4 October 2004, journalist [[Mike Duffy]], (later appointed as a Conservative senator by Harper in December 2008), said "It is possible that you could change prime minister without having an election", and that some Conservatives wanted Harper as prime minister. The next day Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe, accusing them of trying to replace [[Paul Martin]] with Harper as prime minister. Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton's accusations.&lt;ref name=gazetteCoalition/&gt;

===Loss of official party status===
In the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]], in the wake of a surge of support for the New Democratic Party, the Bloc received less than a quarter of the popular vote in Quebec (and less than 6% of the national vote). It lost 44 of the 47 seats it held at parliament's dissolution, and only added one seat, which had been vacated by a Bloc Québécois member six months prior to the election. The seats lost included that of Duceppe, who resigned as party president and leader. It also lost all but one of its seats in Montreal. With few exceptions, the Bloc's seats were won by the NDP, though the Bloc did not suffer as severe a beating as the one it handed the PCs 18 years earlier.

By winning only four seats the Bloc failed to reach the minimum of 12 seats required for [[official party status]] in the House of Commons.  MPs without official party status are treated as independents and must sit in the back row of the opposition benches. They are permitted just a few questions each week in question period and cannot sit as voting members on parliamentary committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duceppe quits after BQ crushed in Quebec|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/05/02/cv-election-bloc-wrap-652.html#|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=2 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520213346/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/05/02/cv-election-bloc-wrap-652.html|archivedate=20 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bloc to seek party status, new leader: MP|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/05/10/bloc-party-status.html|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=10 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808161017/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/05/10/bloc-party-status.html|archivedate=8 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defections===
On 12 August 2014, the caucus was reduced to three MPs when the Bloc's interim parliamentary leader, [[Jean-François Fortin (politician)|Jean-François Fortin]], quit the party to sit as an independent saying that the Bloc Québécois he had joined no longer exists and that Beaulieu had destroyed its credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jean-Francois Fortin quits Bloc, says party no longer exists under new leader|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-francois-fortin-quits-bloc-says-party-no-longer-exists-under-new-leader-1.2734098?cmp=rss|accessdate=12 August 2014|work=CBC News|date=12 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428015222/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-francois-fortin-quits-bloc-says-party-no-longer-exists-under-new-leader-1.2734098?cmp=rss|archivedate=28 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August 2014, former interim parliamentary leader and failed leadership contender [[André Bellavance]] also resigned, reducing the Bloc to two MPs – one of whom, [[Claude Patry]], has announced that he will not be running for re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Bloc MP quits party, leaving only two in Parliament|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/bloc-quebecois-mp-quits-party-pq-left-with-just-two-sitting-mps/article20191190/|accessdate=25 August 2014|work=Globe and Mail|date=25 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825225459/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/bloc-quebecois-mp-quits-party-pq-left-with-just-two-sitting-mps/article20191190/|archivedate=25 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 31, 2014, the party's vice president, Annie Lessard, resigned after a personality conflict with leader Mario Beaulieu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/bloc-quebecois-vp-annie-lessard-resigns-1.2167945 |title=Bloc Quebecois VP Annie Lessard resigns |publisher=CTV Montreal News |date=2014-12-31 |accessdate=2017-04-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426152752/http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/bloc-quebecois-vp-annie-lessard-resigns-1.2167945 |archivedate=26 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return and departure of Duceppe===

[[File:Canadian federal election, 2015 results by riding - Bloc Quebecois strength.svg|thumb|Results of the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 Canadian federal election]] showing support for Bloc Québécois candidates by riding]]
During the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 federal election]] the Bloc Québécois had hoped to pick up seats from the collapsing NDP vote, however, most Quebecers instead switched their allegiance to the Liberals and Conservatives rather than back to the Bloc. While the Bloc managed to win 10 seats, more than twice that of the previous election, it was not enough to gain official party status. The party's share of the popular vote in Quebec fell to 19%, its lowest point up until that time. As in 2011, Duceppe failed to win his own seat, and resigned again as party leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/former-pq-interim-leader-stephane-bedard-leaving-politics/article26925216/ |title=Bloc leader Duceppe, former PQ interim leader both resign |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2015-10-22 |accessdate=2017-04-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404163311/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/former-pq-interim-leader-stephane-bedard-leaving-politics/article26925216/ |archivedate=4 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election of Ouellet and caucus revolt===
The party was led on an interim basis by [[Rhéal Fortin]] until the [[Bloc Québécois leadership election, 2017|Bloc Québécois leadership election in March 2017]] acclaimed [[Martine Ouellet]], a member of the provincial [[National Assembly of Quebec]], as party leader.&lt;ref name=bloc_leadership&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bloc-quebecois-leadership-who-is-martine-ouellet|title=Bloc Québécois' new leader: Who is Martine Ouellet?|work=The Montreal Gazette|accessdate=March 14, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314202301/http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bloc-quebecois-leadership-who-is-martine-ouellet|archivedate=14 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ouellet is not a Member of Parliament and intended to see out her term in the provincial legislature until the next provincial election in October 2018.

On February 28, 2018, seven of the Bloc's ten MPs quit the party's caucus to form the [[Groupe parlementaire québécois]] (later called ''[[Québec debout]]'') citing conflicts with Ouellet's leadership style and her insistence that the Bloc should emphasize promoting Quebec independence over "defending Quebec's interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bloc Québécois fractures as seven of 10 MPs quit over Ouellet's leadership|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/seven-of-10-bloc-quebecois-mps-quit-over-martine-ouellets-leadership/article38144355/#c-image-0|accessdate=March 1, 2018|work=Globe and Mail|date=March 1, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228200806/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/seven-of-10-bloc-quebecois-mps-quit-over-martine-ouellets-leadership/article38144355/#c-image-0|archivedate=28 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allard|first1=Clement|title=Seven of 10 Bloc Quebecois MPs quit over Martine Ouellet’s leadership|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/seven-of-10-bloc-quebecois-mps-quit-over-martine-ouellets-leadership/article38144355/|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=The Globe and Mail|agency=The Canadian Press|date=February 28, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228180649/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/seven-of-10-bloc-quebecois-mps-quit-over-martine-ouellets-leadership/article38144355/|archivedate=28 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three MPs remained in the Bloc's caucus: [[Mario Beaulieu (politician)|Mario Beaulieu]] ([[La Pointe-de-l'Île]]), [[Xavier Barsalou-Duval]] ([[Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères]]), and [[Marilène Gill]] ([[Manicouagan (electoral district)|Manicouagan]]).

More than 20 ex-Bloc MPs, including [[Gilles Duceppe]], issued an [[open letter]] supporting the seven current MPs who had resigned from caucus and demanding Ouellet's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-20-ex-bloc-quebecois-mps-call-on-martine-ouellet-to-quit|title=More than 20 ex-Bloc Québécois MPs call on Martine Ouellet to quit|author=|date=3 March 2018|website=montrealgazette.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304231538/http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-20-ex-bloc-quebecois-mps-call-on-martine-ouellet-to-quit|archivedate=4 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, after a lengthy meeting, the party's executive issued a statement supporting Ouellet's leadership but also stating that the seven rebels could keep their Bloc Québécois memberships and would not be expelled from the party for quitting the caucus, inviting them to return to the caucus in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/bloc-quebecois-meets-to-discuss-fate-of-seven-mps-who-quit-over-leaders-style/wcm/771dd787-4bbd-4f05-86db-0d61b4af77bb|title=Bloc Québécois national office rallies behind Martine Ouellet|author=|date=3 March 2018|website=montrealgazette.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304070939/http://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/bloc-quebecois-meets-to-discuss-fate-of-seven-mps-who-quit-over-leaders-style/wcm/771dd787-4bbd-4f05-86db-0d61b4af77bb|archivedate=4 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Léger Marketing]] poll conducted shortly after put the Bloc Quebecois at 12 per cent among Quebec voters, its lowest rating ever.

==Relationship to Parti Québécois==
The [[Parti Québécois]] has close ties to the Bloc and shares its principal objective of independence for Quebec. The two parties have backed each other during election campaigns, and prominent members of each party often attend and speak at the other's public events. In addition, the majority of each party's membership holds membership in both parties. However, on an organizational level the parties are separate entities – the Bloc is not the federal wing of the Parti Québécois, nor the PQ the provincial wing of the Bloc.

Lucien Bouchard has been the leader of both parties. Michel Gauthier, once Bloc's leader, was a PQ member of the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] from 1981 until 1988. Former party leader Daniel Paillé was also a PQ member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1994 to 1996, and a BQ member of Parliament from 2009 to 2011.

In June 2014, [[Mario Beaulieu (politician)|Mario Beaulieu]], a former PQ riding president and Bloc candidate, was elected leader of the Bloc Québécois. Notwithstanding his previous ties to both parties, Beaulieu has been critical of what he sees as a too timid approach to sovereignty by both the Bloc and PQ. Beaulieu's election as Bloc leader was more warmly received by the PQ's rival party, [[Option nationale]], than by the PQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Don|first1=Macpherson|title=Mario Beaulieu’s victory shows the Bloc’s irrelevance|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Macpherson+Mario+Beaulieu+victory+shows+Bloc+irrelevance/9944189/story.html|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714181254/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Macpherson+Mario+Beaulieu+victory+shows+Bloc+irrelevance/9944189/story.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les députés bloquistes lancent un appel au calme|url=http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/06/17/bloc-quebecois-mario-beaulieu-appel-au-calme-des-deputes_n_5502216.html|accessdate=3 July 2014|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=16 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144354/http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/06/17/bloc-quebecois-mario-beaulieu-appel-au-calme-des-deputes_n_5502216.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gagnon|first1=Lysiane|title=Will the Bloc Self-Destruct?|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/will-the-bloc-self-destruct/article19215051/#dashboard/follows/|accessdate=3 July 2014|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=18 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622013719/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/will-the-bloc-self-destruct/article19215051/#dashboard/follows/|archivedate=22 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martine Ouellet]] was a PQ MNA from 2010 until 2017 and ran twice for the PQ leadership. She continued to sit in the Quebec National Assembly, as an Independent MNA, after she was elected Bloc leader.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 election]], Parti Québécois leader [[Pierre-Karl Péladeau]] officially endorsed the Bloc, despite earlier calling the party useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/peladeau-offers-tepid-support-for-bloc-quebecois-at-weekend-rally-for-leader-1.2388610|title=Peladeau offers tepid support for Bloc Quebecois at weekend rally for leader|work=Montreal|accessdate=14 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810200752/http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/peladeau-offers-tepid-support-for-bloc-quebecois-at-weekend-rally-for-leader-1.2388610|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3526">The '''brigade''' ({{lang-ru|brigada}}) was a labor force division within the Soviet collective farm (''[[kolkhoz]]'').

==The 1930s==
The [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|mass collectivization drive]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s pushed the peasantry from individual household production into an archepeligo of collective farms.  The question of internal organization was important in the new kolkhozes.  The most basic measure was to divide the workforce into a number of groups, generally known as brigades, for working purposes.  `By July 1929 it was already normal practice for the large kolkhoz of 200-400 households to be divided into temporary or permanent work units of 15-30 households.'&lt;ref&gt;[[R W Davies]], ''The Soviet Collective Farm 1929-1930'' (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1980), p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorities gradually came down in favour of the fixed, combined brigade, that is the brigade with its personnel, land, equipment and draught horses fixed to it for the whole period of agricultural operations, and taking responsibility for all relevant tasks during that period.

The brigade was headed by a brigade leader (''brigadir'').  He was usually a local man (few were women).

===Land allotment===
The authorities resolved that each brigade was to have a fixed plot in every field of the [[crop rotation]].  A Communist Party resolution of 4 February 1932 said the brigade's land should be fixed for the agricultural year, but some kolkhozes found that it helped forward planning to fix it for the whole period of the crop-rotation, and this practice was formally adopted in the kolkhoz Model Statute of 1935.&lt;ref&gt;V. P. Sherstobitov, ed., ''Istoriya krest'yanstva SSSR: istoriya sovetskogo krest'yanstva'', vol. 2, ...*; `In 1933 the session of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR proposed that plots be assigned to brigades for the entire period of crop rotation.' CXIV International Conference of Agricultural Economists (Minsk, 1970), ''Agriculture in the Soviet Union'' (trans.), ed. L. Kolesnikov, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the central Asian cotton-growing kolkhozes, each brigade might hold its land as an integral unit, its members living within this unit.&lt;ref&gt;Naum Jasny, ''The Socialized Agriculture of the USSR'' (Stanford University Press, California, 1949), pp.335-6; Sherstobitov, ed., ''Istoriya krest'yanstva SSSR'', vol.2, pp.304-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extent===
Almost two-thirds of kolkhozes (65.1%) had two or more field brigades in 1937.  (Presumably it was the smaller kolkhozes, in northern Russia and elsewhere, that were not divided into brigades.)  Brigades varied in size from 200 workers in the north, north-west and parts of the non-black-earth centre, to about 100 in the Lower and Middle Volga.  The average, in 1937, was 62 people.  A brigade in the black-earth had about 10 hectares of land per member; thus a brigade of 50, for example, had 500 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;Jasny, ''Socialized Agriculture'', pp.335-6; V P Sherstobitov, ed., ''Istoriya krest'yanstva SSSR: istoriya sovetskogo krest'yanstva'', vol. 2, pp.304-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The kolkhoz amalgamations of 1950==
After the kolkhoz amalgamations of 1950 the territorial successor of the old village kolkhoz was the "complex brigade" (brigade of brigades), a sub-unit of the new enlarged kolkhoz.

'''Collective leadership''' ({{lang-ru|коллективное руководство}}, ''{{transl|ru|kollektivnoye rukovodstvo}}'') or '''Collectivity of leadership''' ({{lang-ru|коллективность руководства}}, ''{{transl|ru|kollektivnost rukovodstva}}''), was considered an ideal form of governance in the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) and other socialist states espousing [[communism]]. Its main task was to distribute powers and functions among the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]], and the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] to hinder any attempts to create a [[Autocracy|one-man dominance]] over the Soviet political system by a Soviet leader, such as that seen under [[Joseph Stalin]]'s rule. On the national level, the heart of the collective leadership was officially the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. Collective leadership is characterised by limiting the powers of the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] and the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the Council of Ministers as related to other offices by enhancing the powers of collective bodies, such as the Politburo.

[[Vladimir Lenin]] was, according to [[Soviet literature]], the perfect example of a leader ruling in favour of the collective. Stalin's rule was characterised by one-man dominance, which was a deep breach of [[Democratic centralism|inner-party democracy]] and collective leadership; this made his leadership highly controversial in the Soviet Union following his death in 1953. At the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]], Stalin's reign was criticised as the "cult of the individual". [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Stalin's successor, supported the ideal of collective leadership but only ruled in a collective fashion when it suited him. In 1964, Khrushchev was ousted due to his disregard of collective leadership and was replaced in his posts by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] as First Secretary and by [[Alexei Kosygin]] as Premier. Collective leadership was strengthened during the Brezhnev years and the later reigns of [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms helped spawn factionalism within the Soviet leadership, and members of Gorbachev's faction openly disagreed with him on key issues. The factions usually disagreed on how little or how much reform was needed to rejuvenate the Soviet system.

==History==

===Early years===
[[File:Georgy Malenkov 1964.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Georgy Malenkov, the Premier of the Soviet Union, emerged as one of the major contenders for the Soviet leadership in 1953, but lost to Khrushchev in 1955.{{sfn|Christian|1997|pp=258–259}}]]

[[State ideology of the Soviet Union|Soviet ideologists]] believed{{when|date=December 2013}} that [[Vladimir Lenin]], the [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|first Soviet leader]], thought that only collective leadership could protect the Party from serious mistakes. [[Joseph Stalin]], who consolidated his power after the death of Lenin in 1924, promoted these values; however, instead of creating a new collective leadership, he built up an [[Autocracy|autocratic leadership]] centered around himself.{{sfn|Cocks|Daniels|Heer|1976|pp=26–27}} After Stalin's death (5 March 1953), his successors, while vying for control over the [[Soviet leadership]], promoted the values of collective leadership.{{sfn|Christian|1997|p=258}} [[Georgy Malenkov]], [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | author = Marlowe, Lynn Elizabeth  | title = GED Social Studies: The Best Study Series for GED | publisher = Research and Education Association | year = 2005| location = | page = 140 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NUHU3om46M4C&amp;dq | isbn = 0-7386-0127-6 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; formed a collective leadership immediately after Stalin's death, but it collapsed when Malenkov and Molotov deceived Beria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[William Taubman|Taubman, William]] | year = 2003 | title = Khrushchev: The Man and His Era | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8n7zYmshBNgC&amp;dq | publisher = [[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]] | isbn = 0-393-32484-2 | page = 258 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; After the arrest of Beria (26 June 1953), [[Nikita Khrushchev]] proclaimed  collective leadership as the "supreme principle of our Party". He further stated that only decisions approved by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] (CC) could ensure good leadership for the party and the country.{{sfn|Christian|1997|p=258}} In reality, however, Khrushchev promoted these ideas so that he could win enough support to remove his opponents from power, most notably Premier Malenkov, who resigned in February 1955.{{sfn|Christian|1997|pp=258–259}}

Khrushchev criticised Stalin's rule during the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as a [[Stalin's cult of personality|"cult of the individual"]]. He accused Stalin of reducing the Party's activities and putting an end to [[Democratic centralism|Party democracy]] among others. In the three years following Stalin's death, the Central Committee and the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium]] (Politburo) worked consistently to uphold the collective leadership lost under Stalin.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|pp=96–97}} Khrushchev's rule as First Secretary remained highly controversial throughout his rule in the Party leadership. The first attempt to depose Khrushchev came in 1957, when the [[Anti-Party Group]] accused him of individualistic leadership. The coup failed, but Khrushchev's position weakened drastically. However, Khrushchev continued to portray his regime as a "rule of the collective" even after becoming [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] (Premier of the Soviet Union), replacing [[Nikolai Bulganin]].{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=97}}

===Collectivity of leadership===
[[File:1977 CPA 4774(Cutted).jpg|right|thumb|190px|An official portrait of Leonid Brezhnev from 1977]]
[[File:RIAN archive 724370 Young Communist League Central Committee holds plenary session.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Brezhnev (center with [[Nikolai Podgorny]]) among the members of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR]]
Most Western observers believed that Khrushchev had become the supreme leader of the Soviet Union by the early 1960s, even if this was far from the truth. The Presidium, which had grown to resent Khrushchev's leadership style and feared [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Autocracy|one-man dominance]] and the growing cult of personality in the [[People's Republic of China]], began an aggressive campaign against Khrushchev in 1963. This campaign culminated in 1964{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=97}} with the replacement of Khrushchev in his offices of First Secretary by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and of Chairman of the Council of Ministers by [[Alexei Kosygin]]. Brezhnev and Kosygin, along with [[Mikhail Suslov]], [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]] and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] (replaced in 1965 by [[Nikolai Podgorny]]), were elected to their respective offices to form and lead a functioning collective leadership.{{sfn|Cocks|Daniels|Heer|1997|pp=56–57}} One of the reasons for Khrushchev's ousting, as Suslov told him, was his violation of collective leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Ziegler, Charles | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_JYafMmlG-AC&amp;dq | title = The History of Russia | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 1999| isbn = 978-0-313-30393-7| page = 125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With Khrushchev's removal, collective leadership was again praised by the [[Soviet media]], and it was claimed to be a return to "[[Leninism|Leninist norms of Party life]]".{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=98}} At the plenum which ousted Khrushchev, the Central Committee forbade any single individual to hold the office of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] and Premier simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Robert Service (historian)|Service, Robert]] | title = History of Modern Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-first Century | location = | publisher = [[Penguin Books Ltd]] | year = 2009 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Z1QAAACAAJ&amp;dq | isbn = 0-14-103797-0 | page = 378 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leadership was usually referred to as the "Brezhnev–Kosygin" leadership, instead of the collective leadership, by [[First World]] medias. At first, there was no clear leader of the collective leadership, and Kosygin was the chief economic administrator, whereas Brezhnev was primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the party and internal affairs. Kosygin's position was later weakened when he [[1965 Soviet economic reform|introduced a reform in 1965]] that attempted to decentralise the [[Soviet economy]]. The reform led to a backlash, with Kosygin losing supporters because many top officials took an increasingly anti-reformist stance due to the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Archie Brown|Brown, Archie]] | title = The Rise &amp; Fall of Communism | location = | publisher = [[Bodley Head]] | year = 2009 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yWQpAQAAIAAJ&amp;q | isbn = 978-0-224-07879-5 | page = 403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the years passed, Brezhnev was given more and more prominence, and by the 1970s he had even created a "Secretariat of the General Secretary" to strengthen his position within the Party. At the [[25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|25th Party Congress]], Brezhnev was, according to an anonymous historian, praised in a way that exceeded the praise accorded to Khrushchev before his removal.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=98}} Brezhnev was able to retain the Politburo's support by not introducing the same sweeping reform measures as seen during Khrushchev's rule. As noted by foreign officials, Brezhnev felt "obliged" to discuss unanticipated proposals with the Politburo before responding to them.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|pp=98–99}}

===Later years===
As Brezhnev's health worsened during the late 1970s, the collective leadership became even more "collective". [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's death]] did not alter the [[Separation of power|balance of power]] in any radical fashion, and [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]] were obliged by protocol to rule the country in the very same fashion as Brezhnev.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=98}} When Mikhail Gorbachev was elected to the position of General Secretary in March 1985, some observers wondered if he could be the leader to overcome the restraints of the collective leadership. Gorbachev's reform agenda had succeeded in altering the [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Soviet political system]] for good; however, this change made him some enemies. Many of Gorbachev's closest allies disagreed with him on what reforms were needed, or how radical they should be.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=99}}

==Analysis==

===Soviet assessments===

According to [[Soviet literature]], the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and not the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] was the heart of collective leadership at the national level. At a sub-national level, all Party and Government organs were to work together to ensure collective leadership instead of only the Central Committee. However, as with many other ideological theses, the definition of collective leadership was applied "flexibly to a variety of situations".{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=102}} Making [[Vladimir Lenin]] the example of a ruler ruling in favour of a collective can be seen as proof of this "flexibility".{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=102}} In some Soviet ideological drafts, collective leadership can be compared to [[Collegiality|collegial leadership]] instead of a leadership of the collective. In accordance with a Soviet textbook, collective leadership was:{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=102}}

{{bquote|The regular convocations of Party congresses and plenary sessions of the Central Committee, regular meetings of all electoral organs of the party, general public discussion of the major issues of state, economic and party development, extensive consultation with persons employed in various branches of the economy and cultural life...."{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=102}}}}

In contrast to [[fascism]], which advocates [[Autocracy|one-man dominance]], [[Leninism]] advocates inner-Party democratic collective leadership. Hence, the [[State ideology of the Soviet Union|ideological justification]] of collective leadership in the Soviet Union was easy to justify. The physical insecurity of the political leadership under Stalin, and the political insecurity that existed during Khrushchev's reign, strengthened the political leadership's will to ensure a rule of the collective, and not that of the individual.{{sfn|Taras|1989|p=35}} Collective leadership was a value that was highly esteemed during Stalin and Khrushchev's reigns, but it was violated in practice.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=36}}

===Outside observers===
[[File:JStalin Secretary general CCCP 1942.jpg|left|thumb|Stalin's rule was considered by post-Stalin-era Soviet ideologists as one that disrupted collective decision-making and promoted the cult of the individual.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|pp=96–97}}]]
[[Richard Löwenthal]], a German professor, believed that the Soviet Union had evolved from being a [[totalitarian state]] under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]] into a system that he called "post-totalitarian authoritarianism", or "authoritarian bureaucratic oligarchy",&lt;ref name="laquer"/&gt; in which the Soviet state remained omnipotent in theory and highly authoritarian in practice. However, it did considerably reduce the scale of repression and allowed a much greater level of pluralism into public life.&lt;ref name="laquer"&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Walter Laqueur|Laqueur, Walter]] | title = The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present | location = | publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] | year = 1987 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1NUZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q | page = 243 | isbn = 978-0-684-18903-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1960 paper, Löwenthal wrote that one-man leadership was "the normal rule of line in a one-party state".{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=102}} The majority of [[First World]] observers tended to agree with Löwenthal on the grounds that a collective leadership in an authoritarian state was "inherently unworkable" in practice, claiming that a collective leadership would sooner or later always give in for one-man rule.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=102}} In a different interpretation, the Soviet Union was seen to go into periods of "oligarchy" and "limited-personal rule". Oligarchy, in the sense that no individual could "prevent the adoption of policies in which he may be opposed", was seen as an unstable form of government.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|pp=102–103}} "Limited-personal rule", in contrast with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s "personal rule", was a type of governance in which major policy-making decision could not be made without the consent of the [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|leader]], while the leader had to tolerate some opposition to his policies and to his leadership in general.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=103}}

The historian T. H. Rigby claimed that the Soviet leadership was setting up [[checks and balances]] within the Party to ensure the stability of collective leadership. One anonymous historian went so far as to claim that collective leadership was bound to triumph in any future Soviet political system. Professor Jerome Gilison argued that collective leadership had become the "normal" ruling pattern of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=103}} He argued that the Party had successfully set up checks and balances to ensure the continuity of the Soviet leadership.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=103}} Khrushchev's rule was, according to Gilison, proof that the one-man dominance in Soviet politics had ended. As he noted, Khrushchev "was forced to retreat from unceremoniously from previously stated positions".{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=103}} The "grey men" of the party bureaucracy, Gilison believed, were to become the future Soviet leaders.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=103}} [[Dennis Ross]], an American diplomat, believed the late Brezhnev-era leadership had evolved into a "rule by committee", pointing to several collective Politburo decisions as evidence.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=103}} [[Grey Hodnett]], another analyst, believed that "freer communication" and "access to relevant official information" during the Brezhnev Era had contributed to strengthening the Politburo's collective leadership.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=103}}

According to Thomas A. Baylis, the author of ''Governing by Committee: Collegial Leadership in Advanced Societies'', the existence of collective leadership was due to the individual Politburo members enhancing their own positions by strengthening the collective. Ellen Jones, an educator, noted how each Politburo member specialised in his own field and acted as that field's spokesman in the Politburo. Therefore, collective leadership was divided into Party and Government institutional and organisational lines. The dominant faction, Jones believed, acted as a "coalition" government of several social forces.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=104}} This development led some to believe that the Soviet Union had evolved into [[neo-corporatism]].{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=104}} Some believed Soviet [[Political faction|factionalism]] to be "[[feudal]] in character".{{sfn|Baylis|1989|pp=104–105}} Personal relationship were created to ensure service and support. "Personal factionalism", as Baylis calls it, could either strengthen or weaken the collective leadership's majority.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|pp=104–105}}

Robert Osborn wrote in 1974 that collective leadership did not necessarily mean that the Central Committee, Politburo and the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] were political equals without a clear leading figure.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=104}} Baylis believed that the post of General Secretary could be compared to the office of [[Prime Minister]] in the [[Westminster system]].{{sfn|Baylis|1989|pp=105–106}} The General Secretary in the Soviet political system acted as the leading broker in Politburo sessions and could be considered "the Party leader" due to his negotiation skills and successful tactics which retained the Politburo's support.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=104}} In other words, the General Secretary needed to retain Politburo consensus if he wanted to remain in office.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=104}}

==19th Century==
[[David R. Roediger]] in his book ''Wages of Whiteness'', draws a distinction between black and white wage workers in the 19th century: 
{{quote|As early as 1807, the British investor Charles W. Janson published the indignant replies he had received when he visited an acquaintance in New England and asked the maid who answered the door, 'Is your master home?' Not only did the maid make it clear that she had 'no master' but she insisted, 'I am Mr. ____'s ''help''. I'd have you to know, ''man'', that I am no ''sarvant''; none but ''negars'' are ''sarvants''.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roediger|first=David|title=The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class|year=2007|publisher=Verso|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84467-126-7|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This distinction between free black and white wage workers shows a kind of negative color consciousness, in which the white "help" insists on being recognized as a white person, since she is therefore higher in the social hierarchy, even though she is employed as an unskilled laborer. This contrasts with modern notions of positive color consciousness, through such endeavors as [[affirmative action]], to bolster those that had been handicapped by their race.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9590">[[Image:Cour des Comptes 050917 105256.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Courtroom]]
The  '''Court of Auditors''' (in [[French language|French]] ''Cour des comptes'') is a [[France|French]] [[Judiciary_of_France#Administrative|administrative court]] charged with conducting financial and legislative [[audit]]s of most public institutions and some private institutions, including the central Government, [[Government-owned corporation|national public corporations]], [[Social Security in France|social security]] agencies (since 1950), and [[public services]] (since 1976).  The Court is essentially a cross between a [[Exchequer of Pleas|court of exchequer]], comptroller general's office, and [[Comptroller and Auditor General|auditor general]]'s office in common-law countries.

It is as well a [[Grand Corps of the French State]] mainly recruiting among the best students graduating from the [[Ecole nationale d'administration]].

The Court's three duties are to conduct financial audits of accounts, conduct [[good governance]] audits, and provide information and advice to the French [[Parliament of France|Parliament]] and Administration. The Court verifies the good form of accounting and the proper handling of public money. Established in 1807, the Court is the successor to the [[Chambre des comptes|Paris Court of Accounts]] under the monarchy, or [[Ancien Régime]], and had [[inherent jurisdiction]] to audit all public accounting officials and agencies. The Court of Audit is [[Independent judiciary|independent]] from the [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] branches of Government. However, the 1946 and 1958 French constitutions made it the Court's duty to assist the Cabinet and Parliament in regulating government spending.

==Composition==
The president (''premier président'') of the Court of Audit is appointed by Order-in-Council of the [[Council of Ministers of France|Cabinet]]. Once appointed, the president of the Court and division presidents have security of tenure. The Court has its own [[Public Prosecutor|Office of the Prosecutor]] - with a Chief Prosecutor, Chief Deputy Prosecutor, and two deputy prosecutors - that represents the Government before the Court. The Court is split into seven divisions, each with nearly 30 judges ordinary and deputy judges and headed by a division president. Jurisdiction is split between the seven divisions generally by subject matter, e.g., finance, health and social security, and so forth. The Court's president is Didier Migaud who took over in 2010 following the death of [[Philippe Séguin]]. Other judicial officers are generally split into three groups by rank:
* puisne judges (''conseillers-maîtres'')
**consider, hear, and adjudicate cases in panels
* deputy judges (''conseillers référendaires'')
**divided into 2 classes; handle case management
* Auditor-[[Master (judiciary)|Masters]]&lt;ref&gt;These are not just public financial auditors but also court officers, what are generally known as masters, auditors (in Chancery courts), and commissioners, and in charge of case management, document handling and filing, and presiding over pre-trial or post-trial hearings in addition to auditing agencies and offices.&lt;/ref&gt; (''auditeurs'')
**divided into 2 classes; preside over hearings, collect evidence, audit, and report

All judicial officers are graduates from the National Administration Academy (''École nationale d'Administration'') or recruited from the Office of the Comptroller-General (''inspection générale des Finances'').

==Jurisdiction and duties==
===Original jurisdiction===
The French Court of Audit has original jurisdiction to audit and adjudicate accounts made by public, management, and government accountants. The Court also has authority to audit persons acting but not certified as a public accountant. If an account is found to be correct, then the Court issues a quietus to discharge the accountant. If, however, the account is found to be in error, then a debet order is issued against the defaulter. Either order is subject to appeal in the Court or final appeal at the French Supreme Court.

Audits focus on:
* Government accounting, budgets, and funds
* Public corporations
* National and public institutions, social security organizations, subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries of public corporations
* Government-funded organizations
* Publicly funded organizations

=== Appellate jurisdiction ===
A decision from a lower audit court may be appealed at the main Court of Audit within two months of its being handed down. Afterwards, if the parties are still not satisfied, the Council of State will hear the case on final appeal. 

The French Court of Audit puts together its auditing program entirely independently and is vested with very broad powers of review and examination. It publishes and submits an annual audit report to the French President and to Parliament. The report provides a detailed account of the government's poor, or possibly fraudulent, practices and criticizes poor governance and use of public funds. The Court also audits authorizing officers (''[[ordonnateur]]s'') and their expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Héraud and André Maurin, ''Institutions judiciaires'', 4th edn. (Paris: Dalloz, 2002), 82-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audit procedure==
In addition to reporting poor practices, the Court judges the accounting of public financial and budgetary officials, collection agencies, or treasury departments, e.g., treasurers, paymasters-general, tax collectors, certified public accountants, and can [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] them for late reporting. In such cases, the Court fines public accounting officials for the exact amount of any sum of money that, due to an error on their part, they have unduly paid or failed to recover on behalf of the State. A debet (''débet''), from [[Latin language|Latin]] "he owes" and not limited in amount, is entered against a defaulting person, and the defaulter becomes the State's debtor. Public and government accountants must therefore have performance liability insurance. Often, however, the [[Minister of Finance (France)|Ministry of Finance]] alleviates a defaulter by granting an abatement of his arrears as the full amount is likely too much to ever pay out of pocket. If an account is audited and found not to be in default, then the Court issues a quietus (''arrêt de quitus'' or ''arrêt de décharge'') acquitting and discharging the official and settling the account.&lt;ref&gt;Véronique Le Marchand and Frédéric Touboul, eds., ''Mini-guide de la justice'' (Toulouse, France: Milan, 2003), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional audit courts==

The Court of Audit of France stands above and heads 27 regional inferior financial courts referred to in French as ''Chambres régionales des comptes'', or regional audit courts. The Court of Audit acts as the administrative head and court of appeal for the financial stream, hearing appeals from regional courts and issuing rule promulgation orders and administrative directives. Regional audit courts were established in 1982 to help unburden the main Court of Audit of its heavy caseload. Since their creation, they have original jurisdiction for most local, county, and regional accounting matters in continental France and its overseas dependencies. This means they audit accounts as well as public institutions to check for fraud, imbezzlement, or misappropriation. In case of budgetary discrepancies, the Court can ask the local prefect to intervene and oversee the handling of public funds until budget problems have been corrected.&lt;ref&gt;Le Marchand and Touboul, op. cit., 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each court is divided into divisions and includes a judge-in-Charge - who is also either a puisne or deputy judge at the main Court of Audit - and two associate judges. Judges have security of tenure and some also serve as Commissioners-in-Council with prosecutorial duties under the Office of the Prosecutor at the Court of Audit of France. The regional courts focus on:
* budgetary audits and assessment of local public institutions' budget use and management
* audits of institutions and agencies in a given regional jurisdiction, namely:  public institutions (schools, public housing, hospitals) or groups funded or aided by local governments or public institutions (unions or trade associations)
* efficiency evaluations of account management
Accounts found to be in error are entered into debet and accounts in default or fictitious are referred to the local prefect.

Accounts for towns of fewer than 3,500 inhabitants and receipts totalling less than 750,000 euros are automatically referred to the local county or regional treasurer. A regional audit court's ruling may be appealed in the same court or to the Court of Audit of France.&lt;ref&gt;Héraud and Maurin, op. cit., 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikisource|Cox v. United States (332 U.S. 442)}}
'''''Cox v. United States''''', 332 U.S. 442 (1947), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] found that courts have only limited scope of review over a [[Selective Service]] Board's classification of a [[Jehovah's Witness]] as a [[conscientious objector]] rather than a minister.&lt;ref name="Reed Opinion"&gt;''Cox v. United States'', {{ussc|332|442|1947}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Reed delivered the opinion. Justice Murphy, in dissent said "the mere fact that they spent less than full time in ministerial activities affords no reasonable basis for implying a non-ministerial status."&lt;ref name="Reed Opinion"/&gt;

A rehearing was denied on February 12, 1948.&lt;ref name="Reed Opinion"/&gt;

'''Crowdpac''' is a for-profit website whose purpose is to help unknown [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and independent political outsiders raise money and run for office, and to track political data from across the [[United States]]. While it was originally marketed as a non-partisan political fundraising site, the platform is currently only open for fundraising to select political ideologies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==
It was co-founded in 2014 by [[Steve Hilton]], a former political advisor to British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/steve-hilton-a-brit-out-to-disrupt-american-politics-with-crowdpac/2014/09/03/14e0910e-2efc-11e4-bb9b-997ae96fad33_story.html | title=Steve Hilton, a Brit out to disrupt American politics with Crowdpac | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=3 September 2014 | accessdate=26 June 2017 | author=Payne, Sebastian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/crowdpac-helps-candidates-test-the-waters | title=Crowdpac Helps Candidates Test the Waters | work=[[Roll Call]] | date=9 May 2017 | accessdate=26 June 2017 | author=Garcia, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Adam Bonica]], [[Gisel Kordestani]], and [[Paul Hilder]]. The website is based in [[San Francisco]], and Hilton served as its CEO until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Could-this-San-Francisco-tech-CEO-s-show-pull-11186597.php | title=Could this San Francisco tech CEO’s show pull Fox to the middle? | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=31 May 2017 | accessdate=26 June 2017 | author=Garofoli, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.crowdpac.com/about | title=About | work=Crowdpac.com | accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the company's most successful crowdfunding campaigns was for Kathryn Allen, who raised three times as much money as her would-be challenger, [[Jason Chaffetz]], before Chaffetz announced that he would not run for re-election.&lt;ref name="rc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.recode.net/2017/4/19/15350312/steve-hilton-crowdpac-politics-fundraising-recode-podcast | title=To fix politics, you have to fix fundraising, Crowdpac CEO Steve Hilton says | work=[[Recode]] | date=19 April 2017 | accessdate=26 June 2017 | author=Johnson, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website also uses an algorithm built by researchers at [[Stanford University]] to track political candidates' sources of funding to predict how ideologically partisan they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/14/politics/crowdpac-video-and-story/index.html | title=Rating 2016 candidates by donors busts conventional wisdom | work=[[CNN]] | date=14 January 2015 | accessdate=26 June 2017 | author=Moody, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Co-founder and CEO [[Steve Hilton]], was fired in May 2018 due to his relationship with [[Fox News]] as a conservative [[Pundit|political pundit]] and his conflicting values with the company, with Jesse Thomas appointed as acting CEO.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Crowdpac/a-stand-against-trumpism-a-stand-for-democracy-a45e95a77ed5|title=A stand against Trumpism, a stand for democracy|author=Jesse Thomas|first=|date=May 14, 2018|website=Medium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowdpac announced in May 2018, they have suspended fundraising for Republican candidates on its platform because of the issues with, "hate speech and the rhetoric and actions used to stir up racial animosity legitimized by the President of the United States".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Crowdpac was criticized for providing partisan endorsements in a 2015 election in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://missionlocal.org/2015/11/community-view-crowdpacs-not-so-nonpartisan-sf-endorsements/|title=Community View: Crowdpac's Not So Nonpartisan SF Endorsements|last=Martin|first=Jay|date=2015-11-03|website=MissionLocal|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of their investors is [[Ron Conway]], and he was a candidate for the 2015 election.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was noted that Crowdpac's social media advertised or promote towards certain candidates, like Conway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However Crowdpac denied the claim.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although launched with the aim to be a non-partisan platform, in 2018 the company acting CEO Jesse Thomas decided to block Republican candidates from raising on the platform, stating "This decision has been a hard one for our company, but as Trumpism has spread through the Republican Party we’ve started to see an increase in campaigns for Republican candidates that we cannot allow on our platform."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-host-exits-his-company-over-support-for-trump|title=Fox News Host Exits His Company Over Support for Trump|last=Tani|first=Maxwell|date=2018-05-15|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/387823-campaign-fundraising-site-suspends-republican-accounts-in-effort-to-reject|title=Campaign fundraising site suspends Republican accounts in effort to reject 'Trumpism'|last=Thomsen|first=Jacqueline|date=2018-05-15|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas cited an example of a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] candidate attempting to raise money through the website.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Department of Canadian Heritage''', or simply '''Canadian Heritage''' ({{lang-fr|'''Patrimoine canadien'''}}), is the [[Ministry (government department)|department]] of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Government of Canada]] with responsibility for policies and programs regarding the [[Art in Canada|arts]], [[Culture of Canada|culture]], [[media in Canada|media]], [[Communications in Canada|communications networks]], [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official languages]], [[Women's rights in Canada|status of women]], [[sport in Canada|sports]], and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multiculturalism]].

The Department oversees Royal visits of the [[Queen of Canada]] and members of the royal family to Canada. It was formerly a part of the Department of Communications, until that department's technical side was merged into the Department of Industry in 1996, forming the Department of Canadian Heritage from its non-technical side. In late 2008, the multiculturalism component of this department was transferred to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.

The department's headquarters are in the Jules Léger Building (South) (Édifice Jules Léger (Sud)) in [[Terrasses de la Chaudière]], [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/cntct/index-eng.cfm Contact Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504081228/http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/cntct/index-eng.cfm |date=2011-05-04 }}."

The '''East Turkestan People's Revolutionary Party''' ({{lang-uy|Shärqiy Turkistan Khälq Inqilawi Partiyisi}}; {{zh|东突厥斯坦人民革命党}}) was a [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] [[communist party]] and armed [[separatist]] group in [[Xinjiang]]. It was founded in 1969 or earlier&lt;ref name="Millward"&gt;James Millward, ''Violent Separatism in Xinjiang: A Critical Assessment, Policy Studies'', East-West Center Washington, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; during [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Cultural Revolution]], and was the largest armed separatist group in the [[Xinjiang conflict]] before its dissolution in 1989.&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;David D. Wang, ''East Turkestan Movement in Xinjiang'', Journal of Chinese Political Science, Springer Netherlands, June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1946: The establishment of the People's Revolutionary Party|url=http://www.xjkunlun.cn/dswx/jjds/2010/2030886.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ETPRP's goal was to initiate a second ''[[Revolution of the Three Districts]]'' to establish an [[East Turkestan independence movement|independent]] [[Marxist-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] state in the Xinjiang region, with help from the [[Soviet Union]]. Support from the Soviets increased during the [[Sino-Soviet split]] and subsequent [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|border dispute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Han |first= Enze |date=August 31, 2010 |title=External Kin, Ethnic Identity and the Politics of Ethnic Mobilization in the People's Republic of China |type=Doctor of Philosophy |chapter= |publisher=The Faculty of Columbian College of Arts and Sciences of The George Washington University |docket= |oclc= |url=https://www.academia.edu/8852779/External_Kin_Ethnic_Identity_and_the_Politics_of_Ethnic_Mobilization_in_the_Peoples_Republic_of_China_Dissertation_directed_by |pages=113-114|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ETPRP was founded in 1969 or earlier in [[Xinjiang]], [[China]]. It was made up of mainly [[Uyghurs]], but also had a small number of [[Kazakhs in China|Kazakh]] fighters.&lt;ref name="Castet" /&gt; According to Chinese [[historian]] [[Zhang Yuxi (historian)|Zhang Yuxi]], the ETPRP may have been established secretly in 1963.&lt;ref name="Millward" /&gt; Former members of the ETPRP claimed that the party had around 60,000 members and 178 underground branches in 1969; however, this had not been verified by a third-party.&lt;ref name="Castet" /&gt;

After a failed [[insurrection]] in 1969, the ETPRP gradually weakened due to the arrests of most of their armed fighters and many of their members going into exile. The ETPRP blamed the Soviets for their "lack of commitment" to their cause.&lt;ref name="Millward" /&gt; The party disbanded in 1989.

Iran's economy has been hit hard since the US sanctions that came to effect in mid 2018 and as a result nearly half of its imports and exports have halted with an estimate of 600,000 barrels of oil being slashed.

In 546 BC, [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]] was defeated and captured by the [[Persia]]ns, who then adopted [[gold]] as the main metal for their coins.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title = Gold coins – A Brief History |url = http://www.taxfreegold.co.uk/goldcoinsbriefhistory.html |accessdate = February 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Monetary Episodes from History |url = http://www.galmarley.com/framesets/fs_monetary_history_faqs.htm |accessdate = February 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are accounts in the biblical [[Book of Esther]] of dispatches being sent from Susa to provinces as far out as India and the [[Kingdom of Kush]] during the reign of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes the Great]] (485–465 BC). By the time of [[Herodotus]] (c. 475 BC), the [[Royal Road]] of the [[Persian Empire]] ran some 2,857&amp;nbsp;km from the city of [[Susa]] on the Karun (250&amp;nbsp;km east of the Tigris) to the port of Smyrna (modern [[İzmir]] in [[Turkey]]) on the [[Aegean Sea]].

Modern [[agriculture in Iran]] dates back to the 1820s when [[Amir Kabir]] undertook a number of changes to the traditional agricultural system. Such changes included importing modified seeds and signing collaboration contracts with other countries. [[Lazar Polyakov|Polyakov]]'s ''Bank Esteqrazi'' was bought in 1898 by the [[Imperial Russia|Tzarist government of Russia]], and later passed into the hands of the Iranian government by a contract in 1920.&lt;ref name="Reuter"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.parstimes.com/history/banking_history.html |title = History of Banking in Iran |publisher = Parstimes.com |accessdate = November 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank continued its activities under the name of ''Bank Iran'' until 1933 when incorporating the newly founded [[Keshavarzi Bank]].&lt;ref name="Reuter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LOC5" /&gt;

The [[Imperial Bank of Persia]] was established in 1885, with offices in all major cities of Persia.&lt;ref name="Reuter" /&gt; [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] (r. 1925–41) improved the country’s overall infrastructure, implemented educational reform, campaigned against foreign influence, reformed the legal system, and introduced modern industries. During this time, Iran experienced a period of social change, economic development, and relative political stability.&lt;ref name="LOC5" /&gt;

Reza Shah Pahlavi, who abdicated in 1941, was succeeded by his son, [[Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]] (r. 1941–79). No fundamental change occurred in the [[Economic history of Iran#Pahlavi Era (1925–79)|economy of Iran during World War II]] (1939–45) and the years immediately following. However, between 1954 and 1960 a rapid increase in oil revenues and sustained foreign aid led to greater investment and fast-paced economic growth, primarily in the government sector. Subsequently, inflation increased, the value of the national currency (the rial) depreciated, and a foreign-trade deficit developed. Economic policies implemented to combat these problems led to declines in the rates of nominal economic growth and per capita income by 1961.&lt;ref name="LOC5" /&gt;

Prior to 1979, Iran developed rapidly. Traditionally agricultural, by the 1970s, the country had undergone significant industrialization and modernization.&lt;ref name="documentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="documentary2"/&gt; The pace slowed by 1978 as [[flight of capital|capital flight]] reached $30 to $40 billion 1980-US dollars just before the [[Iranian Revolution|revolution]].&lt;ref name="Migration"&gt;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=424 Shirin Hakimzadeh.

Following the nationalizations in 1979 and the outbreak of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], over 80% of the economy came under government control.&lt;ref name="GSO" /&gt; The eight-year war with Iraq claimed at least 300,000 Iranian lives and injured more than 500,000.

A comprehensive law covers labor relations, including hiring of foreign workers. This provides a broad and inclusive definition of the individuals it covers, recognizing written, oral, temporary and indefinite employment contracts. Considered employee-friendly, the labor law makes it difficult to lay off staff. Employing personnel on consecutive six-month contracts (to avoid paying benefits) is illegal, as is dismissing staff without proof of a serious offense. Labor disputes are settled by a special labor council, which usually rules in favor of the employee.&lt;ref name="Labor"/&gt;

Primitive farming methods, overworked and under-fertilized soil, poor seed and water scarcity are the principal obstacles to increased production. About one third of total cultivated land is irrigated. Construction of multipurpose [[List of reservoirs and dams in Iran|dams and reservoirs]] along rivers in the [[Zagros]] and [[Alborz]] mountains have increased the amount of water available for irrigation.

==== Construction and real estate ====
{{Main|Construction in Iran|Water supply and sanitation in Iran}}
Until the early 1950s construction remained in the hands of small domestic companies. Increased income from oil and gas and easy credit triggered a building boom that attracted international construction firms to the country. This growth continued until the mid-1970s when a sharp rise in inflation and a credit squeeze collapsed the boom. The construction industry had revived somewhat by the mid-1980s, although housing shortages and speculation remained serious problems, especially in large urban centers. As of January 2011, the [[banking in Iran|banking sector]], particularly [[Bank Maskan]], had loaned up to 102 trillion rials ($10.2 billion) to applicants of [[Construction in Iran#Mehr Housing Scheme|Mehr housing scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1389/10/23/MainPaper/3870/Page/4/Index.htm $10b Allocated for Mehr Housing].

[[File:Edict Nantes plaque castle.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating Edict of Nantes]]
The '''Edict of Fontainebleau''' (22 October 1685) was an [[edict]] issued by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of [[France]], also known as the '''Revocation of the Edict of Nantes'''. The [[Edict of Nantes]] (1598) had granted the [[Huguenot]]s the right to practice their religion without persecution from the state. Though Protestants had lost their independence in places of refuge under [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] on account of [[Huguenot rebellions|their supposed insubordination]], they continued to live in comparative security and political contentment. From the outset, [[religious toleration]] in France had been a royal, rather than a popular policy.&lt;ref&gt;"The fate of Catholics at the hands of a triumphant Parliament in England suggests that the Protestants in France would have been no better off under more popular institutions," observed R.R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'', rev. ed. 1956:164.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of universal adherence to his religion did not sit well with Louis XIV's vision of perfected [[autocracy]]: "Bending all else to his will, Louis XIV resented the presence of [[heresy|heretics]] among his subjects."{{Attribution needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;Palmer, ''eo. loc.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edict of Nantes==

The [[Edict of Nantes]] had been issued on 13 April 1598 by [[Henry IV of France]]. It had granted the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestants]] of [[France]] (also known as [[Huguenots]]) substantial [[rights]] in the predominantly [[Catholicism|Catholic]] state. Through the [[Edict]], Henry had aimed to promote civil unity.&lt;ref&gt;In 1898 the tricentennial celebrated the Edict as the foundation of the coming Age of Toleration; the 1998 anniversary, by contrast, was commemorated with a book of essays under the evocatively ambivalent title, ''Coexister dans l'intolérance'' (Michel Grandjean and Bernard Roussel, editors, Geneva, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The Edict treated some Protestants with tolerance and opened a path for [[secularism]]. It offered general [[freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] to individuals and many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their [[civil rights]], including the right to work in any field (including for the state), and to bring grievances directly to the king. It marked the end of the [[French Wars of Religion]] which had afflicted France during the second half of the 16th century.

== Revocation of the Edict of Nantes ==
[[File:Fontainebleau - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The palace at Fontainebleau as it now stands]]
By the Edict of Fontainebleau, Louis XIV revoked the [[Edict of Nantes]] and ordered the destruction of [[Huguenot]] [[Religion in France|churches]], as well as the closing of [[Protestant]] [[Education in France|school]]s. This policy made official the persecution already enforced since the ''[[dragonnade]]s'' created in 1681 by the king in order to intimidate Huguenots into [[religious conversion|converting]] to Catholicism. As a result of the officially sanctioned persecution by the ''[[dragoon]]s'' who were [[billet]]ed upon prominent Huguenots, a large number of Protestants — estimates range from 210,000 to 900,000 — left France over the next two decades. They sought [[refugee|asylum]] in [[England]], the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], [[Denmark]], Protestant states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Cape Colony]] in Africa, and [[European colonization of the Americas|North America]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson J. Spielvogel|Spielvogel]], 0''Western Civilization — Volume II: Since 1500'' (5th Edition, 2003) p.410&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 1686, Louis XIV himself claimed that out of a Huguenot population of 800,000 to 900,000, only 1,000 to 1,500 had remained in France.

A strong advocate for persecution of the Protestants was Louis XIV's pious second wife [[Françoise d'Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon|Madame de Maintenon]], who urged Louis to revoke Henry IV's edict.

The revocation of the Edict of Nantes brought France into line with virtually every other European country of the period (with the brief exception of England, Scotland and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]), where only the majority state religion was legally tolerated. The experiment of religious tolerance in Europe was effectively ended for the time being.

== Effects of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes ==

The Edict of Fontainebleau is compared by many historians with the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]], ordering the [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain]]; and with the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] during 1609-1614. The three are similar both as outbursts of religious intolerance ending periods of relative tolerance, and in their social and economic effects. In practice, the revocation caused France to suffer a kind of early [[brain drain]], as it lost a large number of [[skill]]ed [[crafts]]men, including key designers such as [[Daniel Marot]]. Upon leaving France, Huguenots took with them knowledge of important techniques and styles — which had a significant effect on the quality of the [[history of silk|silk]], [[plate glass]], [[silversmithing]], [[watchmaking]], and [[cabinet making]] [[industry|industries]] of those regions to which they relocated. Some rulers, such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg|Frederick Wilhelm]], [[Duke]] of [[Prussia]] and [[Prince-elector|Elector]] of [[Brandenburg]], who issued the [[Edict of Potsdam]] in late October 1685, encouraged the Protestants to seek refuge in their nations.

==End of the Edict of Fontainebleau==

In practice, the stringency of policies outlawing Protestants, opposed by the [[Jansenist]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. O'Brien, "The Jansenist Campaign for Toleration of Protestants in Late Eighteenth-Century France: Sacred or Secular?" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 1985:523ff.&lt;/ref&gt; was relaxed during the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], especially among discreet members of the upper classes. "The fact that a hundred years later, when Protestants were again tolerated, many of them were found to be both commercially prosperous and politically loyal indicates that they fared far better than the [[Penal Laws|Catholic Irish]]", [[R.R. Palmer]] concluded.&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt;

By the end of the 18th century, prominent French philosophers and literary personalities of the day, including [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]], were making persuasive arguments to promote religious tolerance. Efforts by [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Guillaume-Chrétien de Malesherbes]], minister to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and [[Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Etienne]], spokesman for the Protestant community in with members of a provincial appellate court or [[parlement]] of the [[Ancien Régime]], were particularly effective in convincing the king to open French society over the concern expressed by some advisors. Thus, on 7 November 1787, Louis XVI signed the [[Edict of Versailles]], known as the edict of tolerance registered in ''parlement'' two-and-a-half months later, on 29 January 1788. This edict offered relief to the main alternative faiths of [[Calvinist]] [[Huguenots]], [[Lutherans]] and [[Judaism in France|Judaism]] – giving followers the civil and legal recognition, as well as the right to openly form congregations after 102 years of prohibition. Full religious freedom had to wait two more years, with enactment of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]].  The 1787 edict was a pivotal step in eliminating religious strife, and it officially ended religious persecution in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals, ''Edict of Versailles (1787)''], downloaded 29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, once French Revolutionary armies got to other European countries between 1789 and 1815, they followed a consistent policy of [[emancipation|emancipating]] persecuted or discriminated religious communities (Catholic in some countries, Protestant in others, Jews in virtually all).

==The apology==
In October 1985, [[President of France|French President]] [[François Mitterrand]] issued a public apology to the descendants of Huguenots around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discours.vie-publique.fr/notices/857015500.html |title=Allocution de M.

An '''essential medicines policy''' is one that aims at ensuring that people get good quality [[Medication|drugs]] at the lowest possible price, and that doctors prescribe the minimum of required drugs in order to treat the patient's illness. The pioneers in this field were [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Chile]].

== Background ==

A [[rational drug policy]] is one based on drug use in which patients receive medications appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost to them and their community. [[Pharmaceutical companies]] make considerable money by selling drugs under their [[trade name]]s, promoting the [[brand]]ed drugs as against those named generically. Doctors often prescribe branded drugs which are more expensive than [[generic drugs]] which have the same efficacy.

In the 1960s and 1970s Chile attempted to introduce a rational policy, based on a limited number of [[essential drugs]]. The [[Chilean pharmaceutical policy]] failed due to pressure from the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. In the 1970s Sri Lanka demonstrated that a state buying agency linked to a [[national formulary]] was a viable and powerful instrument for reducing drug costs without compromising quality, for saving foreign exchange, for rationalising drug usage and for supplying essential drugs at reasonable prices to the whole community. This was made possible by the  formulation and implementation of an integrated national pharmaceutical policy.

The [[Sri Lanka National Pharmaceuticals Policy|Sri Lanka experience]] became a model for the rest of the world by [[Seneka Bibile|Prof.Seneka Bibile]]

=== Causes of irrational drug use ===

*Irrational prescribing practices of doctors
*Dispensing by pharmacists and drug sellers
*Drug pricing policies and promotional activities of the pharmaceutical industry
*Lack of information, education and communication on rational drug use to providers and consumers
*Lack of effective control and regulatory mechanisms on drug use and
*Lack of political will and leadership to promote rational use.

== Centralised buying agency ==

Under an integrated national pharmaceutical policy, the central buying agency channells all imports and production of pharmaceuticals, calling for worldwide bulk [[Request for tender|tenders]] which are limited to the approved drugs listed in the national formulary. The public and private health sectors must obtain all their requirements from the central buying agency.

In [[Chile]] in 1971, the government of Dr [[Salvador Allende]] organised [[centralised]] bulk procurement and the first international [[Call for bids|tender]] for raw materials was called. However, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] struck back and, in the three months following the call for tender, widely used drugs disappeared from the market, including analgesics and antibiotics. The manufacturers had cut their production. They agreed to replenish the market within one week only if the international tenders were called off. In 1972, the government was forced to succumb and called off the tenders.

In Sri Lanka  the Sri Lanka [[State Pharmaceuticals Corporation of Sri Lanka|State Pharmaceuticals Corporation]] (SPC) was established in 1972 with Bibile as Chairman. Hence the stranglehold of the [[multinational corporation]]s on the drug trade was successfully broken and they were made to compete with each other and with generic drug producers, enabling the country to obtain drugs much cheaper. Branded drugs were replaced by generic drugs in the prescription and sale of medicines.

In 1972 it imported 52 drugs at a third of their previous prices. In 1973, the SPC itself bought the raw material necessary for 14 private processing laboratories established in the island. Some drug prices dropped by half or two-thirds. The SPC bought from an [[India]]n company the raw material necessary for a widely used [[tranquilliser]] at a much lower price than that charged by a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] multinational.jh

== Drug information ==

It is essential that correct information drugs and therapeutics be given to all medical personnel. The promotional material provided by the drugs manufacturers tends to be distorted in favour of their own products and adds to the costs of supplying drugs.

In Sri Lanka, drug information was provided from official sources. ''The Prescriber'', a quarterly publication edited by the NFC, was published by the SPC and distributed to all medical personnel. The extravagant promotional practices of drugs manufacturers were stopped to remove the dangers and costs inherent in process.

The Sri Lankan policy was supported by [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and other [[United Nations]] agencies with enormous benefit to [[Third World]] countries. The [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] Secretariat examined the Sri Lankan experience, concluding that an analysis of the Sri Lankan model could give other developing countries an insight into ways of formulating, developing and implementing integrated national pharmaceutical policies. With Bibile’s assistance, it  published "Case Studies in the Transfer of Technology: Pharmaceutical Policies in Sri Lanka". [https://web.archive.org/web/20041223192702/http://r0.unctad.org/en/pressref/stdissue.htm] This document has proved to be a very valuable guideline for developing countries intending to initiate pharmaceutical reforms. Translated into other languages, it may be found with health planners of almost every Third World country.

The "Guide to Good Prescribing" has been translated into 18 languages and adopted by teaching institutions throughout the world.

The WHO took Sri Lanka's experience to the rest of the World,  with the result that by 2000:

*over 100 countries had national pharmaceuticals policies,
*156 countries had national or provincial [[essential medicines]] lists
*135 countries had national treatment guidelines/formulary manuals
*88 countries had introduced the essential drug concept into medical and pharmacy [[curricula]].

[[Bangladesh]] is a [[least developed country]] which has confirmed and reiterated that it is within the capabilities countries with limited resources to successfully introduce an integrated national pharmaceutical policy.

The Chilean experience showed the power of the pharmaceuticals giants. The successful implementation of pharmaceutical reforms in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh was due to the presence of the vital ingredient of political will with which real progress is possible.

'''Freelanthropy''' was started in 2004 to help [[non-profit organization]]s raise money online.

Freelanthropy was developed to tap the power of "[[pay per click]]" (PPC) search advertising for non-profit organizations. In August 2004 along with its parent company, Freelanthropy was merged with Vendare Media and Freelanthropy launched to the public in early 2005 with its first product, the Charitable Toolbar, powered by [[Yahoo!]] and AskJeeves (now [[Ask.com]]) search services. Dan Sheehy, who had originally conceived the idea and retained social entrepreneur Thorsten Hoins to develop the beta site, purchased Freelanthropy from Vendare in December 2005.

==Current business==
Freelanthropy still offers free customized browser search toolbars to [[non-profit organizations]], but no installed software is required to use the service and Freelanthropy's offerings have expanded to include a consumer search portal that allows users to designate support for any one of more than 1.3 million [[501(c)]] and [[527 group]] organizations (registered US non-profits) in Freelanthropy's database. In 2006 Freelanthropy entered into a new multi-year partnership with Yahoo! who now exclusively powers the search experience for both Freelanthtropy's custom browser toolbars as well as the Freelanthropy.com search portal. Ask.com is no longer involved. Freelanthropy also helps to generate revenue for its non-profit partners through its "Shop &amp; Give" directory which includes hundreds of online merchants. When people access any of these merchants through Freelanthropy's Shop &amp; Give program, money is raised for the designated non-profit organization. All of Freelanthropy's services are completely free for its non-profit partners, their constituents, as well as the general public that support charities through the Freelanthropy.com search portal. Freelanthropy does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). The toolbars that Freelanthropy creates for its nonprofit partners are free of any adware, spyware or "malware," and function purely to reinforce the charities' brand with their supporters, facilitate Yahoo searches, and deliver messages from the charities to their supporters via the toolbar's RSS feature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3712">'''Heinrich Gresbeck''', also known as Henry Gresbeck, was a carpenter who was living in the city of [[Münster]] in 1534 when the [[Münster Rebellion]] began. He wrote the only eyewitness account of events ''within'' the city for the fifteen months duration of the rebellion, and played a key role in the recapture of the city by guiding the siege forces of [[Franz von Waldeck]], Bishop of Münster inside the fortress gates.

For these actions Gresbeck has been described in various texts as a "convert", "traitor", "collaborator", "deserter", "chronicler", and "disgruntled city refugee".

[[File:Nations of the UK.png|thumb|330px|The complex evolution of the states of the British Isles. Those states evolved from the conquests and mergers of earlier states.]]
The ''' formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''' has involved [[personal union|personal]] and [[political union]] across [[Great Britain]] and the wider [[British Isles]]. The [[United Kingdom]] is the most recent of a number of sovereign states that have been established in Great Britain at different periods in history, in different combinations and under a variety of [[polity|polities]]. [[Norman Davies]] has counted sixteen different states over the past 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Norman. ''The Isles: A History''. (London: Macmillan, 1999. {{ISBN|0-333-69283-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the start of the 16th century, the number of states in Great Britain had been reduced to two: the [[Kingdom of England]] (which included Wales and controlled Ireland) and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. The once independent [[Principality of Wales]] fell under the control of English monarchs from the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284. The [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603, the accidental consequence of a royal marriage one hundred years earlier, united the kingdoms in a [[personal union]], though full political union in the form of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] required a [[Treaty of Union]] in 1706 and [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707 (to ratify the Treaty).

The [[Act of Union 1800]] united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which had been gradually brought under English control between 1541 and 1691, to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801. Independence for the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 followed the partition of the island of [[Ireland]] two years previously, with six of the nine counties of the [[province of Ulster]] remaining within the UK, which then changed to the current name in 1927 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

In the 20th century, the rise of [[Welsh nationalism|Welsh]] and [[Scottish nationalism]] and resolution of [[the Troubles]] in Ireland resulted in the establishment of [[devolution|devolved]] parliaments or assemblies for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

{{Main|Conquest of Wales by Edward I}}
Through internal struggles and dynastic marriage alliances, the Welsh became more united until [[Owain Gwynedd]] (1100–1170) became the first Welsh ruler to use the title ''princeps Wallensium'' (prince of the Welsh).&lt;ref name="Wales Hist 128"&gt;{{cite book|last =Davies|first =John|authorlink =John Davies (historian)|title = A History of Wales|publisher = Penguin|year = 1993|location = London|pages = 128| isbn = 0-14-014581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After invading England, land-hungry [[Normans]] started pushing into the relatively weak [[Welsh Marches]], setting up a number of lordships in the eastern part of the country and the border areas. In response, the usually fractious Welsh, who still retained control of the north and west of Wales, started to unite around leaders such as Owain Gwynedd's grandson [[Llywelyn the Great]] (1173–1240), who is known to have described himself as "prince of all North Wales".&lt;ref&gt;p.239, [[Rees Davies|Davies, R. R.]] 1987. ''Conquest, coexistence and change: Wales 1063–1415'' Clarendon Press, University of Wales Press. {{ISBN|0-19-821732-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Llywelyn wrestled concessions out of the [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 and received the [[fealty]] of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdovey, becoming the first [[Prince of Wales]]. His grandson, [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], also secured the recognition of the title ''[[Prince of Wales]]'' from [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] with the [[Treaty of Montgomery]] in 1267. However, a succession of disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn's wife [[Eleanor de Montfort|Eleanor]], daughter of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], culminated in the first invasion by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]. After a military defeat, the [[Treaty of Aberconwy]] in 1277 reasserted Llywelyn's fealty to the King of England.

In 1282, after another rebellion, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] finally made a permanent conquest.  With Llywelyn dead, the King took over his lands and dispossessed various other allied princes of northern and western Wales,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Prestwich]], ''Edward I'' (London: Methuen, 1988, updated edition Yale University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-300-07209-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; and across that area Edward established the [[historic counties of Wales|counties]] of [[Isle of Anglesey|Anglesey]], [[Caernarfonshire]], [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]], [[Merionethshire]], [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]] and [[Carmarthenshire]]. The [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] formally established Edward's rule over Wales two years later although Welsh law continued to be used.  Remaining princes became marcher lords. Edward's son (later [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]), who had been born in Wales, was made [[Prince of Wales]]. The tradition of bestowing the title "Prince of Wales" on the heir of the British Monarch continues to the present day. To help maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of great stone [[castle]]s.

Initially, the Crown had only indirect control over much of Wales because the [[Marcher Lord|Marcher lords]] (ruling over independent lordships in most of the country) were independent from direct Crown control. The exception was the lands of the [[Principality of Wales#1284 to 1542: annexed to the English crown|Principality of Wales]] in the north and west of the country, which was held personally by the King (or the heir to the Crown) but was not incorporated into the Kingdom of England.  However, between the 13th and 16th centuries the Crown gradually acquired most of the Marcher Lordships, usually through inheritance, until almost all of Wales came under Crown control. Nevertheless, the whole of Wales &amp;mdash; that is, the Principality, Marcher Lordships held by the Crown and Marcher Lordships held by others &amp;mdash; remained outside of the legal and constitutional structures of the Kingdom of England.

There was no major uprising except that led by [[Owain Glyndŵr]] a century later, against [[Henry IV of England]]. In 1404 Glyndŵr was crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain, and Scotland; he went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including [[Machynlleth]]. The rebellion was ultimately to founder, however. Glyndŵr went into hiding in 1412, and peace was more or less restored in Wales by 1415.

The power of the Marcher lords was ended in 1535, when the political and administrative union of England and Wales was completed. The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Laws in Wales Act 1535]] annexed Wales to England and extended English law to Wales, abolished the marcher lordships and partitioned their lands into the [[Historic counties of Wales|counties]] of [[Brecknockshire|Brecon]], [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbigh]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouth]], [[Montgomeryshire|Montgomery]], and [[Radnorshire|Radnor]] while adding parts to [[Gloucestershire|Gloucester]], [[Herefordshire|Hereford]], and [[Shropshire|Salop]]. (Monmouthshire was wholly subsumed into the court structure of England and so omitted from the subsequent Laws in Wales Act of 1542, which led to ambiguity about its status as part of England or Wales.) The Act also extended the Law of England to both England and Wales and made English the only permissible language for official purposes. This had the effect of creating an English-speaking ruling class amongst the Welsh, at a time when Welsh was the language of the great majority. Wales was also now represented in Parliament at Westminster.

===English Conquest of Ireland===
{{main|History of Ireland}}
By the 12th century, [[Ireland]] was divided. Power was exercised by the heads of a few regional dynasties vying with each other for supremacy over the whole island. In 1155 Pope [[Adrian IV]] issued the papal bull [[Laudabiliter]] giving the Norman King [[Henry II of England]] lordship over Ireland. The bull granted Henry the right to invade Ireland in order to reform Church practices. When the King of [[Leinster]] [[Diarmait Mac Murchada|Diarmuid MacMorroug]] was forcibly exiled from his kingdom by the new High King, [[Ruaidri mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]], he obtained permission from [[Henry II of England]] to use [[Normans|Norman]] forces to regain his kingdom. The [[Normans]] landed in Ireland in 1169, and within a short time Leinster was reclaimed by Diarmait, who named his son-in-law, [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]], heir to his kingdom. This caused consternation to [[Henry II of England|Henry]], who feared the establishment of a rival Norman state in Ireland.
[[File:www.wesleyjohnston.com-users-ireland-maps-historical-map1300.gif|thumb|200px|right|The extent of Norman control of Ireland in 1300.]]
With the authority of the papal bull Henry landed with a large fleet in 1171 and claimed sovereignty over the island. A peace treaty followed in 1175, with the Irish High King keeping lands outside Leinster, which had passed to Henry on the expected death of both Diarmait and de Clare. When the High King lost his authority Henry awarded his Irish territories to his younger son [[John of England|John]] with the title ''Dominus Hiberniae'' ("Lord of Ireland") in 1185. When John unexpectedly became King of England, the Lordship of Ireland fell directly under the English Crown. The title of Lord of Ireland and King of England fell into personal union. Throughout the 13th century the policy of the English Kings was to weaken the power of the [[Norman Ireland|Norman Lords]] in Ireland.

There was a resurgence of [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] power as rebellious attacks stretched Norman resources. Politics and events in Gaelic Ireland also served to draw the settlers deeper into the orbit of the Irish. When the [[Black Death]] arrived in Ireland in 1348 it hit the English and Norman inhabitants who lived in towns and villages far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the countryside again. The English-controlled area shrunk back to the [[The Pale|Pale]], a fortified area around Dublin.

Outside the Pale, the Hiberno-Norman lords adopted the Irish language and customs. Over the following centuries they sided with the indigenous Irish in political and military conflicts with England and generally stayed Catholic after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The authorities in the Pale grew so worried about the "Gaelicisation" of Ireland that they passed special legislation banning those of English descent from speaking the Irish language, wearing Irish clothes, or inter-marrying with the Irish. Since the government in Dublin had little real authority, however, the Statutes did not have much effect. By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared.

In 1532, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke with [[Pope|Papal]] authority. While the English, the Welsh, and the Scots accepted [[Protestantism]], the Irish remained Catholic. This affected Ireland's relationship with England for the next four hundred years since the English tried to re-conquer and colonise Ireland to prevent Ireland being a base for Catholic forces that were trying to overthrow the Protestant settlement in England.

In 1536, Henry VIII decided to re-conquer Ireland and bring it under Crown control so the island would not become a base for future rebellions or foreign invasions of England. In 1541, he upgraded Ireland from a lordship to a full kingdom. Henry was proclaimed [[King of Ireland]] at a meeting of the Irish Parliament. With the institutions of government in place, the next step was to extend the control of the English Kingdom of Ireland over all of its claimed territory. The re-conquest was completed during the reigns of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and [[James I of England|James I]], after several bloody conflicts. However, the English were not successful in converting the Catholic Irish to the Protestant religion, and the brutal methods used by Crown authority to pacify the country heightened resentment of English rule.

From the mid-16th and into the early 17th century, Crown governments carried out a policy of [[colonisation]] known as [[Plantations of Ireland|Plantations]]. Scottish and English Protestants were sent as colonists to the provinces of [[Munster]], [[Ulster]], and the counties of [[Laois]] and [[Offaly]]. These settlers, who had a British Protestant identity, would form the ruling class of future British administrations in Ireland. A series of [[Penal Laws]] discriminated against all faiths other than the established ([[Anglican]]) [[Church of Ireland]].

===Personal Union: Union of the Crowns===
[[File:Royal Arms of England (1603-1707).svg|thumb|right|The first [[coat of arms]] for [[Great Britain]], as used in the [[Kingdom of England]], from 1603]]
In August 1503 [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]], King of Scots, married [[Margaret Tudor]], the eldest daughter of [[Henry VII of England]]. Almost 100 years later, when [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] was in the last decade of her reign, it was clear to all that [[James VI of Scotland]], the great-grandson of James IV and Margaret Tudor, was the only generally acceptable heir to the English throne. From 1601, Elizabeth I's chief minister [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]] maintained a secret correspondence with James in order to prepare in advance for a smooth succession. Elizabeth died on 24 March 1603, and James was proclaimed king in London later the same day. Despite sharing a monarchy, Scotland and England continued as separate countries with separate parliaments for over one hundred more years.

James had the idealistic ambition of building on the personal union of the crowns of Scotland and England so as to establish a permanent [[Union of the Crowns]] under one monarch, one parliament, and one law. He insisted that English and Scots should "join and coalesce together in a sincere and perfect union, as two twins bred in one belly, to love one another as no more two but one estate". James's ambitions were greeted with very little enthusiasm, as one by one members of parliament rushed to defend the ancient name and realm of England. All sorts of legal objections were raised: all laws would have to be renewed and all treaties renegotiated. For James, whose experience of parliaments was limited to the stage-managed and semi-feudal Scottish variety, the self-assurance — and obduracy — of the English version, which had long experience of upsetting monarchs, was an obvious shock. The Scots were no more enthusiastic than the English because they feared being reduced to the status of Wales or Ireland. In October 1604, James assumed the title "King of Great Britain" by proclamation rather than statute, although [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] told him he could not use the title in "any legal proceeding, instrument or assurance". The two realms continued to maintain separate parliaments. The [[Union of the Crowns]] had begun a process that would lead to the eventual unification of the two kingdoms. However, in the ensuing hundred years, strong religious and political differences continued to divide the kingdoms, and common royalty could not prevent occasions of internecine warfare.

James did not create a [[British Crown]], but he did, in one sense at least, create the British as a distinct group of people. In 1607 large tracts of land in [[Ulster]] fell to the crown. A new Plantation was started, made up of Protestant settlers from Scotland and England. Over the years the settlers, surrounded by the hostile Catholic Irish, gradually cast off their separate English and Scottish roots, becoming British in the process, as a means of emphasising their "otherness" from their [[Gaels|Gaelic]] neighbors. It was the one corner of the British Isles where Britishness became truly meaningful as a political and cultural identity in its own right, as opposed to a gloss on older and deeper national associations.

Ruling over the diverse kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland proved difficult for James and his successor [[Charles I of England|Charles]], particularly when they tried to impose religious uniformity on the Three Kingdoms. There were different religious conditions in each country. [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] had made himself head of the [[Church of England]], which was reformed under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and became [[Anglican]] under Elizabeth I. Protestantism became intimately associated with national identity in England. Roman Catholicism was seen as the national enemy, especially as embodied in France and Spain. However, Catholicism remained the religion of most people in Ireland and became a symbol of native resistance to the Tudor re-conquest of Ireland in the 16th century. Scotland had a national church, the [[Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]], although much of the [[Scottish Highlands|highlands]] remained Catholic. With the support of the [[Episcopal polity|Episcopalians]], James reintroduced bishops into the Church of Scotland against the wishes of the presbyterian party.

In 1625, James was succeeded by his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who in 1633, some years after his [[coronation]] at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]], was crowned in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], [[Edinburgh]], with full Anglican rites. Opposition to his attempts to enforce Anglican practices reached a flashpoint when he tried to introduce a [[Book of Common Prayer]]. Charles's confrontation with the Scots came to a head in 1639, when he tried and failed to coerce Scotland by military means. In some respects, this revolt also represented Scottish resentment at being sidelined within the Stuart monarchy after James I's accession to the throne of England. It led to the [[Bishop's Wars]].

[[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s accession also marked the beginning of an intense schism between King and Parliament. Charles's adherence to the doctrine of the [[Divine Right of Kings]], a doctrine foreign to the English mentality he had inherited from his father, fuelled a vicious battle for supremacy between King and Parliament. Therefore, when Charles approached the Parliament to pay for a campaign against the Scots, they refused, declared themselves to be permanently in session and put forward a long list of civil and religious grievances that Charles would have to remedy before they approved any new legislation. Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Ireland, Charles I's Lord Deputy there, [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth]], had antagonised the native Irish Catholics by repeated initiatives to confiscate their lands and grant them to English colonists. He had also angered them by enforcing new taxes but denying Roman Catholics full rights as subjects. What made this situation explosive was his idea, in 1639, to offer Irish Catholics the reforms they had been looking for in return for them raising and paying for an Irish army to put down the Scottish rebellion. Although the army was to be officered by Protestants, the idea of an Irish Catholic army being used to enforce what was seen by many as tyrannical government horrified both the Scottish and the English Parliament, who in response threatened to invade Ireland.

Alienated by British Protestant domination and frightened by the rhetoric of the English and Scottish Parliaments, a small group of Irish conspirators launched the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], ostensibly in support of the "King's Rights". The rising was marked by widespread assaults on the British Protestant communities in Ireland, sometimes culminating in massacres. Rumours spread in England and Scotland that the killings had the King's sanction and that this was a foretaste of what was in store for them if the King's Irish troops landed in Britain. As a result, the English Parliament refused to pay for a royal army to put down the rebellion in Ireland and instead raised its own armed forces. The King did likewise, rallying those [[Cavalier|Royalists]] (some of them members of Parliament) who believed that loyalty to the legitimate King was the most important political principle.

The [[English Civil War]] broke out in 1642. The Scottish [[Covenanter]]s, as the Presbyterians called themselves, sided with the English Parliament, joined the war in 1643, and played a major role in the English Parliamentary victory. The King's forces were ground down by the efficiency of Parliament's [[New Model Army]] – backed by the financial muscle of the [[City of London]]. In 1646, Charles I surrendered. After failing to come to compromise with Parliament, he was arrested and executed in 1649. In Ireland, the rebel Irish Catholics formed their own government – Confederate Ireland with the intention of helping the Royalists in return for religious toleration and political autonomy. Troops from England and Scotland fought in Ireland, and Irish Confederate troops mounted an expedition to Scotland in 1644, sparking the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scottish Civil War]]. In Scotland, the Royalists had a series of victories in 1644–45 but were crushed with the end of the first English Civil War and the return of the main Covenanter armies to Scotland.

After the end of the second English Civil War, the victorious Parliamentary forces, now commanded by [[Oliver Cromwell]], invaded Ireland and crushed the Royalist-Confederate alliance there in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649. Their alliance with the Scottish Covenanters had also broken down, and the Scots crowned [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as king. Cromwell therefore embarked on a conquest of Scotland in 1650–51. By the end of the wars, the Three Kingdoms were a unitary state called the [[Commonwealth of England|English Commonwealth]], ostensibly a [[republic]] but having many characteristics of a [[martial law|military dictatorship]].

While the Wars of the Three Kingdoms pre-figured many of the changes that would shape modern Britain, in the short term it resolved little. The [[Commonwealth of England|English Commonwealth]] did achieve a compromise (though a relatively unstable one) between a monarchy and a republic. In practise power was exercised by Oliver Cromwell because of his control over the Parliament's military forces, but his legal position was never clarified, even when he became [[Lord Protector]]. While several constitutions were proposed, none were ever accepted. Thus the Commonwealth and [[the Protectorate]] established by the victorious Parliamentarians left little behind it in the way of new forms of government. There were two important legacies from this period: the first was that in executing King Charles I for [[high treason]], no future British monarch could be under any illusion that perceived despotism would be tolerated, and the second was that the excesses of Army rule, particularly that of the Major-Generals, has left an abiding mistrust of military rule in the English speaking world.

Ireland and Scotland were occupied by the New Model Army during the Interregnum. In Ireland, almost all lands belonging to Irish Catholics were confiscated as punishment for the rebellion of 1641; harsh [[Penal Laws]] were also passed against this community. Thousands of Parliamentarian soldiers were settled in Ireland on confiscated lands. The Parliaments of Ireland and Scotland were abolished. In theory, they were represented in the English Parliament, but since this body was never given real powers, this was insignificant. When Cromwell died in 1658, the Commonwealth fell apart without major violence, and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was restored as King of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Under the [[English Restoration]], the political system returned to the constitutional position of before the wars: Scotland and Ireland were returned their Parliaments.

When [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] died his Catholic brother [[James II of England|James]] inherited the throne as James II of England and VII of Scotland. When he had a son, the Parliament of England decided to depose him in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. He was replaced not by his Roman Catholic son, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], but by his Protestant daughter and son-in-law, [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and [[William III of England|William III]], who became joint rulers in 1689. James made one serious attempt to recover his crowns, which ended with defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690.

==Formation of the Union==

===Acts of Union 1707===
{{main|Treaty of Union|Acts of Union 1707}}
[[File:Articles of Union.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A published version of the Articles of Union, 1707]]
Deeper political integration was a key policy of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (1702–14), who succeeded to the throne in 1702 as the last Stuart monarch of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] (she was also the only Stuart monarch of [[Great Britain]]). The Queen appointed Commissioners for the union on the part of Scotland and England respectively, and in 1706 they began negotiations in earnest, with agreement reached on the terms of a [[Treaty of Union]] on 22 July 1706.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/images/historical/1707union.cfm Articles of Union with Scotland 1707] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503023739/http://www.parliament.uk/about/images/historical/1707union.cfm |date=3 May 2008 }} www.parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances of Scotland's acceptance of the Bill are to some degree disputed. Scottish proponents believed that failure to accede to the Bill would result in the imposition of Union under less favourable terms, and the [[Lord Justice Clerk]], James Johnstone later observed that ''"As for giving up the legislative power, we had none to give up... for the true state of the matter was whether Scotland should be subject to an English ministry without the privilege of trade or be subject to an English Parliament with trade."'' Months of fierce debate on both sides of the border were to follow, particularly in Scotland where debate could often dissolve into civil disorder, most notably by the notorious "[[Edinburgh]] Mob". The prospect of a union of the kingdoms was deeply unpopular among the Scottish population at large; however, following the financially disastrous [[Darien Scheme]], the near-bankrupt [[Parliament of Scotland]] did accept the proposals.

In 1707, the Acts of Union received their [[Royal assent]], thereby abolishing the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland and their respective parliaments to create a unified [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] with a single Parliament of Great Britain. Anne formally became the first occupant of the unified British throne, and Scotland sent 45 MPs to the new [[List of Parliaments of Great Britain|parliament at Westminster]]. Perhaps the greatest single benefit to Scotland of the Union was that she could enjoy [[free trade]] with England and her [[English overseas possessions|possessions overseas]]. For England's part, a possible ally for European states hostile to England had been neutralised while simultaneously securing a Protestant succession to the new British throne.

However, certain aspects of the former independent kingdoms remained separate. Examples of Scottish and English institutions that were not merged into the British system include [[Scots Law|Scottish]] and [[English law]], [[Bank of Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Bank of England|English]] banking systems, the [[Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]] and the [[Anglican]] [[Church of England]] and the systems of education and higher learning. These remain separate.

===Acts of Union 1800===
{{Development of the Union Flag}}
{{main|Act of Union 1800}}
After the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], Irish Catholics were barred from voting or attending the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. The new English Protestant ruling class was known as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. Towards the end of the 18th century the entirely Protestant Irish Parliament attained a greater degree of independence from the British Parliament than it had previously held. Under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] no Irish Catholic could sit in the [[Parliament of Ireland]], even though some 90% of Ireland's population was native Irish Catholic when the first of these bans was introduced in 1691. This ban was followed by others in 1703 and 1709 as part of a comprehensive system disadvantaging the Catholic community and to a lesser extent Protestant dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umn.edu/irishlaw/offices.html Laws in Ireland for the Suppression of Popery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103073154/http://www.law.umn.edu/irishlaw/offices.html |date=3 January 2008 }} at University of Minnesota Law School&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798, many members of this dissenter tradition made common cause with Catholics in a rebellion inspired and led by the [[Society of United Irishmen]]. It was staged with the aim of creating a fully independent Ireland as a state with a republican constitution. Despite assistance from France, the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] was put down by British forces.

The legislative union of Great Britain and Ireland was completed by the [[Acts of Union 1800]] passed by each parliament, uniting the two kingdoms into one, called "The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]".&lt;ref&gt;Article I, Treaty of Union 1800&lt;/ref&gt; The twin Acts were passed in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] and the [[Parliament of Ireland]]  with substantial majorities achieved in Ireland in part (according to contemporary documents) through [[bribery]], namely the awarding of [[peerage]]s and [[honour]]s to critics to get their votes.&lt;ref&gt;Alan J. Ward, ''The Irish Constitutional Tradition'' p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the union, there was to be but one [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Article III, Treaty of Union 1800&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland sent four lords spiritual (bishops) and twenty-eight lords temporal to the House of Lords and one hundred members to the House of Commons at Westminster. The lords spiritual were chosen by rotation, and the lords temporal were elected from among the peers of Ireland.

Part of the arrangement as a trade-off for Irish Catholics was to be the granting of [[Catholic Emancipation]], which had been fiercely resisted by the all-Anglican Irish Parliament. However, this was blocked by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], who argued that emancipating Roman Catholics would breach his [[Oath of Office#Coronation Oath|Coronation Oath]]. The Roman Catholic hierarchy had endorsed the Union. However, the decision to block Catholic Emancipation fatally undermined its appeal.

==The "disuniting" of the United Kingdom==

===Irish alienation and independence===

The 19th century saw the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s, during which one million [[Irish people]] died and over a million emigrated. Aspects of the United Kingdom met with popularity in Ireland during the 122-year union. Hundreds of thousands flocked to Dublin for the visits of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1900, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] and [[Queen Alexandra]] in 1903 and 1907, and [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1911. About 210,000 Irishmen fought for the United Kingdom in [[World War I]], at a time when Ireland was the only home nation where conscription was not in force.

The 19th century and early 20th century saw the rise of [[Irish Nationalism]], especially among the Catholic population. From the General Election of 1874 until the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, the majority of MPs elected from Irish constituencies supported [[Home Rule]], sometimes finding themselves holding the balance of power in the House of Commons. Frustrated by lack of political progress, an armed rebellion took place with the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916. Two years later, the more radical, republican party, [[Sinn Féin]], won 73 of the 103 Irish constituencies. Sinn Féin had promised not to sit in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] but rather to set up an Irish Parliament, known as the [[First Dáil]], which declared Irish independence by reaffirming the 1916 declaration, leading to the subsequent [[Irish War of Independence]]. In 1921, [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|a treaty]] was concluded between the British Government and a delegation of Irish leaders. Under the treaty, [[Northern Ireland]] would form a [[home rule]] state within the new [[Irish Free State]] unless it opted out. Northern Ireland had a majority Protestant population and opted out as expected. A [[Boundary Commission (Ireland)|Boundary Commission]] was set up to decide on the border between the two Irish states, though it was subsequently abandoned after it recommended only minor adjustments to the border.

The Irish Free State was initially a [[British Dominions|British dominion]] like Canada and South Africa with [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] as its head of state. Along with the other dominions, it received full legislative autonomy under the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. Renamed Ireland in 1937, it [[Republic of Ireland Act|declared itself a republic in 1949]] and thereby ceased to be regarded as in the British Commonwealth having no constitutional ties to the United Kingdom.

The "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland" continued in name until 1927 when it was renamed the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" by the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]] (although, strictly speaking, the Act only referred to the King's title and the name of Parliament). In 1948 a working party chaired by the [[Norman Craven Brook, 1st Baron Normanbrook|Cabinet Secretary]] recommended that the country's name be changed to the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ulster".&lt;ref&gt;British National Archives, Catalogue Reference:CAB/129/32 (Memorandum by PM Attlee to Cabinet appending Working Party Report): Working party to consider "what consequential action may have to be taken by the United Kingdom Government as a result of [[Ireland (state)|Eire]]'s ceasing to be a member of the Commonwealth"&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Clement Attlee|prime minister]] did not favour the change and it was not made.&lt;ref&gt;British National Archives, Catalogue Reference:CAB/129/32 (Memorandum by PM Attlee to Cabinet appending Working Party Report)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite increasing political independence from each other from 1922, and complete political independence since 1949, the union left the two countries intertwined with each other in many respects. Ireland used the [[Irish Pound]] from 1928 until 2001 when it was replaced by the [[Euro]]. Until it joined the ERM in 1979, the Irish pound was directly linked to the [[Pound Sterling]]. [[Decimalisation]] of both currencies occurred simultaneously on [[Decimal Day]] in 1971. Irish Citizens in the UK have a status almost equivalent to British Citizens. They can vote in all elections and even stand for parliament. British Citizens have similar rights to Irish Citizens in the Republic of Ireland and can vote in all elections apart from presidential elections and referendums. People from Northern Ireland can have a right to Irish citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/en/constitution/index.html#part1 27th Amendment to the Constitution of Ireland; Article 9 (Section 2, 1°) at irishstatutebook.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|1={{quote|Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution, a person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, who does not have, at the time of the birth of that person, at least one parent who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen is not entitled to Irish citizenship or nationality, unless provided for by law. This section shall not apply to persons born before the date of the enactment of this section|27th Amendment to the [[Constitution of Ireland]]; Article 9 (Section 2, 1°)}}}}

Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom. Since 1922 it has sometimes enjoyed self-government, at other times being ruled directly from Westminster, but even while self-governing it has always kept its representation in the United Kingdom Parliament and formed part of the country which since 1927 has included "Northern Ireland" in its name.

===Devolved Assemblies===

====Northern Ireland====

The [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] in its current guise was first elected on 25 June 1998 and first met on 1 July 1998. However, it only existed in "shadow" form until 2 December 1999 when full powers were [[devolution|devolved]] to the Assembly. The Assembly's composition and powers are laid down in the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]]. The Assembly has both legislative powers and responsibility for electing the [[Northern Ireland Executive]].

The Assembly has [[Northern Ireland Assembly#Powers and functions|authority to legislate]] in a field of competences known as "transferred matters". These matters include any competence not explicitly retained by the Parliament at Westminster. Powers reserved by Westminster are divided into "excepted matters", which it retains indefinitely, and "reserved matters", which may be transferred to the competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly at a future date.

====Scotland====

A [[Scottish Parliament]] was convened by the [[Scotland Act 1998]], following a [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|referendum in 1997]], in which the Scottish electorate voted for [[devolution]]. The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999. It has the [[Scottish Parliament#Legislative functions|power to legislate]] in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster. The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws.

====Wales====

The [[National Assembly for Wales]] was created by the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]], which followed a [[Welsh devolution referendum, 1997|referendum]] in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to initiate [[primary legislation]] until limited law-making powers were gained through the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]]. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the [[Welsh devolution referendum, 2011|referendum on 3 March 2011]], making it possible for it to [[Act of the National Assembly for Wales|legislate]] without having to consult the UK [[parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] or the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] in the [[National Assembly for Wales#Devolved areas|20 areas that are devolved]].

===Prospect of Scottish independence===

In 2014, [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|55% of Scottish voters rejected leaving the UK in an independence referendum]]. However, after the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 European Union membership referendum]], in which Scotland voted to remain in the EU while the UK overall voted to leave, there is [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|the prospect of a second Scottish independence referendum]].

The '''Human Dignity Alliance''' ({{lang-ga|Comhaontas Dhínit an Duine}}) is a minor [[List of political parties in the Republic of Ireland|political party]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It was officially founded on 29 June 2018 by Senator [[Rónán Mullen]].&lt;ref name="TheTimes_1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mullen-founds-new-pro-life-dignity-party-n2dxbr0b9|title=Mullen founds new pro-life ‘dignity’ party|last=Coyle|first=Colin|date=1 July 2018|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=3 July 2018|issn=0956-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Rónán Mullen, the party's founder, has served as an independent senator for the National University of Ireland constituency since 2007. In 2014 he contested the European Parliament election unsuccessfully in the Midlands-North-West constituency. Mullen was prominent in campaigns opposing [[Same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland|same-sex marriage]] in 2015 and [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|abortion]] in 2018 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/head-to-head-r%C3%B3n%C3%A1n-mullen-argues-against-same-sex-marriage-1.2221383|title=Head to head: Rónán Mullen argues against same-sex marriage|work=The Irish Times|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/senator-accused-of-further-stigmatising-those-with-mental-health-issues-1.3504880|title=Senator accused of ‘further stigmatising’ those with mental health issues|work=The Irish Times|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[European Christian Political Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.appf.europa.eu/appf/en/transparency.html|title=List of registered European Political Parties|website=www.appf.europa.eu|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
The Human Dignity Alliance was borne out of a political grouping within Leinster House that met annually. The party is registered to contest European and Oireachtas elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/currentissues/Ir290618.pdf|work=[[Iris Oifigiúil]]|date=29 June 2018|title=Issue 52|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mullen predicted the party would be a "slow burner" and see growth over time.&lt;ref name="TheTimes_1" /&gt; Independent TD [[Mattie McGrath]] ruled out joining the Human Dignity Alliance, instead opting for forming his own party alongside fellow independent TD [[Michael Collins (Schull politician)|Michael Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/mattie-mcgrath-not-to-join-human-dignity-alliance-political-party-1.3550255|title=Mattie McGrath not to join Human Dignity Alliance political party|work=The Irish Times|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those missing include Pakistani army personnel, those involved in spying for Pakistan, or those suspected of spying for India. According to the report "persons are arrested and disappeared if they refuse to join or try to leave the forces engaged in the “Jihad” inside Indian-held Kashmir or don’t provide information to the intelligence agencies about the movements of people across the border control line. A significant number of cases point to the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]]’s involvement in these disappearances".&lt;ref name=ALRC/&gt;

[[Brad Adams]], the Asia director at Human Rights Watch has said in 2006 "Although ‘azad’ means ‘free,’ the residents of Azad Kashmir are anything but free. The Pakistani authorities govern Azad Kashmir with strict controls on basic freedoms".&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Brad|title=Pakistan: ‘Free Kashmir’ Far From Free|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/09/20/pakistan-free-kashmir-far-free|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2012-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314000110/http://www.hrw.org/news/2006/09/20/pakistan-free-kashmir-far-free|archive-date=2013-03-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams cited a law where those who opposed Pakistan's position on Kashmir were not allowed to contest regional elections, as an example of "political repression".&lt;ref name="TN"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/645684-hrw-alleges-abuses-in-ajk-tariq-azim-rejects-report|title=HRW alleges abuses in AJK Tariq Azim rejects report|date=22 September 2006|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507063106/https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/645684-hrw-alleges-abuses-in-ajk-tariq-azim-rejects-report|archive-date=7 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also detailed it could not find evidence that Pakistan's security agencies were held accountable for incidents involving torture or mistreatment.&lt;ref name="TN"/&gt;

Adams added that the problems were not "rampant" but they needed to be addressed, and that the severity of [[Human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir|human rights issues in Indian-administered Kashmir]] were "much, much, much greater".&lt;ref name="TN"/&gt; Pakistan's Information Minister [[Tariq Azim Khan]] rejected the contents of the report and said that Azad Kashmir was free of human rights violations.&lt;ref name="TN"/&gt;

In 2011 Afzaal Suleria stated that the ISI kidnapped and killed a doctor which led to demonstrations against the ISI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Choudhry|first=Shabir|title=PAKISTAN: Another Azad Kashmiri becomes the victim of ISI butchery|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/news/forwarded-news/AHRC-FPR-027-2011|publisher=Asian Human Rights Commission|access-date=2012-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327114952/http://www.humanrights.asia/news/forwarded-news/AHRC-FPR-027-2011/|archive-date=2012-03-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While speaking to Dr Shabir Choudhry, Afzaal Suleria, President of the [[United Kashmir People's National Party]]- Azad Kashmir Chapter said: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Another innocent Azad Kashmiri has become a victim of the ISI. We people are constantly harassed and victimised because we oppose the Pakistani occupation of our motherland.”&lt;ref name=Choudhry&gt;{{cite web|last=Choudhry|first=Shabir|title=PAKISTAN: Another Azad Kashmiri becomes the victim of ISI butchery|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/news/forwarded-news/AHRC-FPR-027-2011|publisher=Asian Human Rights Commission|access-date=2012-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327114952/http://www.humanrights.asia/news/forwarded-news/AHRC-FPR-027-2011/|archive-date=2012-03-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Other Kashmir National Party leaders, Abbas Butt, Dr Shabir Choudhry, Asim Mirza, Nawaz Majid, and others have strongly denounced this brutal killing and demanded those responsible must be held accountable for their actions.&lt;ref name=Choudhry/&gt;

==Politics==

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], 
&lt;blockquote&gt;the Pakistani government represses democratic freedoms, muzzles the press and practices routine torture.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tight controls on freedom of expression have been a hallmark of government policy in Azad Kashmir. Pakistan has prevented the creation of independent media in the territory through bureaucratic restrictions and coercion. Under Azad Kashmir’s constitution, which Pakistan enforced in 1974, election candidates are “prescreened” to ensure that only those who support Kashmir’s union with Pakistan can contest elections. Anyone who wants to take part in public life in Azad Kashmir has to sign a pledge of loyalty to Pakistan, while anyone who publicly supports or peacefully works for an independent Kashmir faces persecution.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan: ‘Free Kashmir’ Far From Free|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/09/20/pakistan-free-kashmir-far-free|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=Human Rights Watch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314000110/http://www.hrw.org/news/2006/09/20/pakistan-free-kashmir-far-free|archive-date=14 March 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The electoral law undermines Kashmiris’ basic political rights by barring them from seeking office if they oppose Kashmir’s accession to Pakistan, [..] Those who favor independence invite the ire of Pakistan’s abusive intelligence agencies and military, and they risk being beaten and jailed.”&lt;ref name="HRW Brad"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan: Abuses Feared in Kashmir Elections|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/07/05/pakistan-abuses-feared-kashmir-elections|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24379">[[Iceland]] is generally considered to be one of the leading countries in the world in regard to the human rights enjoyed by its citizens. Human rights are guaranteed by Sections VI and VII of [[Constitution of Iceland|Iceland's Constitution]]. Since 1989, a post of [[Iceland Ombudsman|Ombudsman]] exists. Elections are free and fair, security forces report to civilian authorities, there is no state violence, and human-rights groups are allowed to operate without restriction. Religious freedom is guaranteed, and discrimination based on race, gender, disability, language, or other factors is illegal.

The General Committee of the [[Parliament of Iceland|Icelandic Parliament]], the Althingi, is responsible for the legislative oversight of human rights, and a special ombudsman monitors human rights in the country and reports to the government on violations of human-rights law.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt;

In a 2012 interview, a member of the UN Human Rights Committee singled out two principal human-rights problems in Iceland: “inequality between women and men...especially in the labour market” and the “sexual abuse of children.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Flinterman discusses the main issues of the review of Iceland's 5th periodic report |work=Human Rights Committee - 105 Session- Review of Iceland |author=Centre for Civil and Political Rights (CCPR) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQURumQVyB4 |publisher=Youtube |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human-rights ombudsman==
Iceland's independent human-rights ombudsman is elected by parliament. Individuals can file complaints with the ombudsman about the actions of public officials, and the ombudsman may demand to see government reports and compel officials to give testimony. Although the ombudsman can only issue recommendations, not orders, the government generally acts upon those recommendations.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Iceland |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154429.htm |publisher=United States Department of State |date=April 8, 2011 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Civil liberties==
Iceland's constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the press. Iceland has full Internet freedom, academic freedom, freedom of assembly and association, and freedom of religion. There is also full freedom of movement within the country, freedom to travel abroad, to move out of the country and move back. Iceland accepts refugees; forced exile is illegal.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt;
Iceland's 2008 banking crisis, however, affected certain freedoms, in the view of economists Jon Danielsson and Ragnar Arnason. They noted in a November 2011 article that “Icelandic firms seeking to invest abroad need rarely-granted permission from the Central Bank. Icelandic citizens need a government authorisation for foreign travel, since a Central Bank licence is needed to get tightly rationed foreign currency for travel. Any individual seeking to emigrate from Iceland is at least partially locked in by the capital controls by virtue of not being able to transfer his or her assets abroad, a restriction on emigration not commonly seen in democracies. This disregard of individuals’ civil rights as a result of the capital controls violates Iceland’s legal commitments under the European four freedoms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Danielsson |first1=Jon |last2=Arnason |first2=Ragnar |title=Capital controls are exactly wrong for Iceland |url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/iceland-and-imf-why-capital-controls-are-entirely-wrong |work=Vox |publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research |date=14 November 2011 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights of victims of rape and domestic abuse==
While rape can be punished by up to 16 years in prison, the typical sentence is no more than three years. There have been complaints that in cases of rape the burden of proof is so heavy that it discourages the reporting and prosecution of such crimes. Although the punishment for domestic violence can also be up to 16 years in prison, with the law permitting judges “to increase the sentences of persons who commit violence against persons with whom they had a domestic relationship or other close bond,” there were no domestic violence cases in 2010 in which sentences were increased. Moreover, the number of women seeking medical help and counselling in the wake of domestic incidents significantly exceeds the number actually reporting such incidents, and some observers explain this by pointing to the infrequency of actual convictions and the lenient sentences for those convicted.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt;

Icelandic law defines sexual harassment very broadly, essentially including any activity that is perceived as disrespectful. Those who consider themselves to have been harassed can report incidents to the Complaints Committee on Equal Status. While Icelandic courts have the power to issue restraining orders, critics have complained that such orders did not have the desired effect because they were granted too infrequently and took too long to be issued. Victims of sexual harassment have the right to be represented by lawyers, but most such victims choose not to take legal action.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt;

==Family rights and gender equality==
Icelanders have the right to determine for themselves how many children they will have; they enjoy free access to contraceptives as well as to prenatal, obstetric, and postpartum care. Women are equal to men under the law, but earn less on average. The Centre for Gender Equality (CGE) promotes gender equality and provides counselling and education on the subject to various public and private institutions. Violations of gender equality are adjudicated by the Complaints Committee on Equal Status, whose members are appointed by the minister of social affairs and social security, who also appoints members of the Equal Status Council, which makes recommendations for improving workplace equality.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt;

A CGE pamphlet addressed to foreign women in Iceland explains to them what their rights are as
residents of Iceland, and also contains information about Icelandic law regarding residency, marriage, divorce, custody, social benefits, and domestic abuse. In addition, it provides contact information for organizations that can help women in abusive situations. The pamphlet explains that men and women in Iceland are equal and that violence and threats against women are illegal. It also helpfully addresses a number of practical violations of human rights that foreign women may experience in their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Your Rights: Important information for foreign women in Iceland |publisher=Icelandic Human rights Centre |url=http://www.humanrights.is/human-rights-and-iceland/important-information-for-foreign-women-in-iceland/|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Icelandic Human Rights Centre (IHRC) noted that in 2006, up to 40% of women who seek refuge at the Women’s Shelter in Reykjavik were immigrants. Previously, foreign women who left their spouses within three years after receiving residency permits lost their rights to residency, thus leading to cases in which women stayed in abusive marriages to avoid deportation. Although the Icelandic government professed to be aware of this problem and claimed that in practice it routinely renewed the residency permits of women in such situations, many such women were unaware of this practice. Two recent amendments to the Act on Foreign Nationals address these situations. One of the amendments denies residency permits to immigrant women on the basis of cohabitation with partners known to be abusive; the other amendment encourages women to leave such relationships by offering them the opportunity to apply for another type of residency permits. While the IHRC praises these amendments, it says that not enough has been done to protect and help immigrant women, in particular to help them learn Icelandic and become full members of society.&lt;ref name=IHRC /&gt;

==Disabled persons' rights==
While Icelandic law prohibits discrimination against disabled persons and requires that such
persons “receive preference for government jobs,” advocates for the disabled complain that these laws are not fully enforced and that disabled people represent a majority of Iceland's poor. Icelandic law ensures “access to buildings, information, and communications” to disabled persons; yet while violations are supposed to be punished by up to two years in prison, advocates for the disabled complain that such punishments “rarely, if ever,” take place. The government body mainly responsible for disabled rights is the Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Security.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt;  The IHRC agrees that while the situation of the disabled in Iceland “has improved vastly” in recent years, “disabled persons in Iceland habitually suffer discrimination with respect to, for instance, the right to education, housing and participation in public life.”&lt;ref name=IHRC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Civil Society Report on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) |publisher=The Icelandic Human Rights Centre |url=http://www.ccprcentre.org/doc/HRC/Iceland/NGO%20Information/IHRC_Iceland105.pdf |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT rights==
{{Main|LGBT rights in Iceland}}
During 2010, there were no reports of violence or discrimination in Iceland based on sexual orientation or on HIV/AIDS status.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt; A 2011 report by the IHRC noted that largely as a result of the efforts of the National Organization of Lesbians and Gay Men (now the National Queer Organization), founded in 1978, gay people had spoken out more openly about their orientation and now enjoy widespread acceptance in Iceland. In recent years the NQO and IHRC have concentrated their efforts on transgender rights, and especially on the lack of legislation on transgender issues. The IHRC does note that it has recently been made easier for transgender people to change their names and gender officially. The IHRC further notes that “adoption rights and a legal right to clinical fertilization of lesbians were established in 2006 and a new and universal Act of Marriage, applying equally to hetero-and homosexual couples was passed through Parliament on 11 June 2010.”&lt;ref name=IHRC&gt;{{cite web|title=Icelandic Human Rights Centre|url=http://www.ccprcentre.org/doc/HRC/Iceland/NGO%20Information/IHRC_Iceland105.pdf|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial discrimination and immigrants' rights==
Although Article 65 of the Icelandic Constitution establishes equality of all Icelanders and forbids racial discrimination, and although a number of Icelandic laws also underscore the constitutional guarantee of equality, the IHRC has complained that Icelandic law does not clearly define racial discrimination or provide sufficiently for combating discrimination. The IHRC has also criticized Iceland for its failure to sign or ratify the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.&lt;ref name=IHRC /&gt;

Some immigrants from Eastern Europe have been harassed in Iceland, and in September 2010 the Icelandic media focused on the case of a Cuban father and son who left the country briefly after a series of attacks on their home. In the wake of this episode, other immigrants came out in the media recounting their own experiences with racism.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt; The IHRC has pointed to cases in which immigrants had been refused “access to public spaces” and had endured harassment in violation of Article 180 of the Penal Code No. 19/1940, which forbids denying an individual “service, or access to any public area or place intended for general public use, on account of that person’s colour, race or ethnic origin.” Although no one has ever filed a complaint based on an alleged violation of Article 180, and no one has ever been convicted of violating it, the IHRC has recommended that police officers and service people be given training that explains to them the seriousness of such violations. The IHRC has even called for a “reversal of the burden of proof” in such cases, arguing, in other words, that those accused of acting out of racial or ethnic prejudice should be considered guilty until proven innocent.{{Failed verification|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref name=IHRC /&gt;

==Employees' rights==
Under Icelandic law, workers can form and join labour unions, which are independent of the government and of political parties. About 80 to 85 percent of persons employed in Iceland are members of unions, and 100 percent are covered by collective-bargaining agreements. Employees have the right to strike, although the government has instituted mandatory mediation in cases where strikes have endangered important economic sectors, such as fishing. In March 2010 the Icelandic parliament banned a strike by Icelandair's aircraft mechanics.  While forced labour is illegal, there have been reports of women who have been trafficked to Iceland for sexual exploitation and of men being trafficked to the country to work in construction, manufacturing, and restaurants. Indications are that the men, most of them Eastern European, knowingly and willingly take illegal work in Iceland to earn more than they would earn at home.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt;

The IHRC has noted that there are indeed “indications that Iceland is now a destination country for sex-trafficking,” and suggests that foreign women working in Icelandic strip clubs are examples of such trafficking. “There are stories of women arriving in the country to work in a strip club having their passports and return tickets taken from them and being forced to work off their debt before being able to leave the club,” reports the IHRC, which has noted that it, along with the Icelandic women’s movement, had long been advocating for legislation that would provide for “victim and witness protection” to people involved in human trafficking. Although several bills that would have provided for such protection have been submitted to the Parliament, no such law has yet been passed.&lt;ref name=IHRC /&gt;

It is against the law in Iceland to employ persons under 16 “in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labour,” although children of 14 or 15 “may work part time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous jobs.” The Administration of Occupational Safety and Health (AOSH) enforces these regulations. 

Iceland has no official minimum wage. Instead, minimum wages for specific occupations are negotiated in collective bargaining agreements which may be “industry-wide, sector-wide, or in some cases firm-specific.” The official workweek is 40 hours, including nearly three hours of breaks. Anyone working over eight hours a day must be paid overtime.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt;

==Prisoners' and detainees' rights==
Prison conditions in Iceland are generally up to international standards. There is a separate minimum-security prison for women, but because the number of female prisoners in Iceland is generally so low (at any given time, the average number is four), some male inmates are also housed there, although in different cellblocks. Juvenile offenders are generally held in facilities supervised by the Government Agency for Child Protection. Moreover, at times when the main prison at Litla-Hraun or Reykjavik's pretrial detention facility is overcrowded, pretrial detainees are held at local police precincts. In 2010, owing to [[prison overcrowding]], 276 individuals who had been convicted of crimes were on a waiting list to serve their sentences.

Arbitrary arrest and detention are prohibited in Iceland. When individuals are sentenced to serve less than six months, the Prison and Probation Administration (PPA) has the power to sentence them to community service rather than prison. Prisoners can receive visitors and can complain about prison conditions to the judiciary and to a parliamentary ombudsman. In 2010, there was not a single allegation of inhumane prison conditions.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt;

==Police powers and arrest procedures==
The Icelandic police, who are under civilian authority, “may make arrests under a number of circumstances: when they believe a prosecutable offense has been committed, when they see a need to prevent further offenses or destruction of evidence, when they need to protect a suspect, or when a person refuses to obey police orders to move. Arrest warrants usually are not employed; the criminal code explicitly requires warrants only for arresting individuals who fail to appear at court for a hearing or a trial or at a prison to serve a sentence.” Under Icelandic law, individuals who have been arrested must be told at once what they are being charged with, informed of their rights, and brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest. They have a right to legal counsel, and those who cannot afford to pay for counsel are entitled to an attorney of their choice, paid for by the government, although if found guilty they are obliged to repay the government for the cost of their defence.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt;

==Court system and trial procedures==
The Icelandic judiciary is independent. It is up to the individual judge to decide whether to keep a suspect in custody during a crime investigation or to grant release pending trial. There is no bail system.

The Icelandic constitution guarantees a fair trial. Although trials are usually open to the public, they may be held behind closed doors at the request of the defendant or in cases involving minors. There are no juries, but instead judges or multijudge panels. Defendants have the right to attend their trial, to confront witnesses, and to present evidence. In some cases, prosecutors may introduce evidence that has been obtained illegally. Defendants may appeal verdicts to the Supreme Court.

There is no distinction in Iceland between criminal and civil courts. The judiciary is on two levels, the district courts and the Supreme Court. 

House searches without a prior court order are permitted by immigration law in some cases involving possible immigration fraud.&lt;ref name=USDOSHRR2010 /&gt;

==Human-rights organizations==

===Institute of Human Rights===
The Institute of Human Rights describes itself as “an independent institution, founded by the University of Iceland, the Icelandic Law Society and the Icelandic Judge’s Society, 14th April 1994.” Headquartered in Lögberg on Suðurgata, it produces “research relating to the legal aspects of human rights, see to mediating research results and support teaching in this field. To this end the institute’s board shall, for instance, initiate seminars about human rights issues and support students, lecturers, lawyers, judges and others in studies, and initiate information meetings regarding human rights issues.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Human Rights|publisher=University of Iceland|url=http://english.hi.is/school_of_social_sciences/faculty_of_law/institute_of_human_rights|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Icelandic Human Rights Centre===
The [[Icelandic Human Rights Centre]] (IHRC) describes its aim as being “to promote human rights by collecting information on and raising awareness of human rights issues in Iceland and abroad. The Centre works to make human rights information accessible to the public by organising conferences and seminars on human rights issues and by providing human rights education.” It “also promotes legal reform and research on human rights and has established the only specialised human rights library in Iceland.” Furthermore, it “serves a monitoring role and has, since its inception, commented on dozens of bills of law and public policy and provided information to international monitoring bodies on the state of human rights in Iceland.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.humanrights.is/english/about-us/|publisher=Icelandic Human Rights Centre|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The IHRC notes that it “has assumed the functions of a national human rights institution as set out in the UN Paris principles, though its powers, independence and financing are not established by statute.”&lt;ref name=IHRC /&gt;

It has achieved PCI-HSM certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/popups/pts_device.php?appnum=4-20333|title=PCI Security Standards - PCI-HSM certification for IBM 4768|last=|first=|date=|website=PCI Security Standards Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBM 4768 data sheet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc3/pdf/4768_PCIe_Data_Sheet.pdf|title=IBM 4768 Data Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the coprocessor in detail.

IBM supplies two cryptographic-system implementations:

* The PKCS#11&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/|title=Cryptsoft|website=www.cryptsoft.com|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; implementation creates a high-security solution for application programs developed for this industry-standard API.
* The IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) implementation provides many functions of special interest in the finance industry, extensive support for distributed key management, and a base on which custom processing and cryptographic functions can be added.

Applications may include financial PIN transactions, bank-to-clearing-house transactions, EMV transactions for integrated circuit (chip) based credit cards, and general-purpose cryptographic applications using [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key algorithms]], [[hashing algorithm]]s, and [[public key algorithm]]s.

The operational keys (symmetric or RSA private) are generated in the coprocessor and are then saved either in a keystore file or in application memory, encrypted under the master key of that coprocessor. Any coprocessor with an identical master key can use those keys. Performance benefits include the incorporation of [[Elliptic-curve cryptography|elliptic curve cryptography]] (ECC) and [[Format-preserving encryption|format preserving encryption]] (FPE) in the hardware.

IBM supports the 4768 on certain IBM Z mainframes as Crypto Express6S (CEX6S) - feature code 0893.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/form/anonymous/api/wiki/33d270cb-c060-40f6-99f3-956c3cb452a3/page/885fd4df-c77d-4bb8-a43b-f4f44100b3ac/attachment/7fd7adad-44dd-43c9-90d7-5c97650da544/media/IBM%20z14%20technology%20Pitch.pdf|title=IBM z14 Hardware Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4768 / CEX6S is part of IBM's support for pervasive encryption&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8270590/|title=Enabling pervasive encryption through IBM Z stack innovations - IBM Journals &amp; Magazine|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://briandcolwell.com/2017/07/ibm-z14-enforcing-data-as-the-new-perimeter-enabling-scale-for-the-cloud/.html|title=IBM z14: Enforcing Data As The New Perimeter, Enabling Scale For The Cloud|date=2017-07-17|work=Brian D.

{{main|Intersex medical interventions}}
ISNA stated that newborn intersex genitals should not be operated on, unless there need to be in order to maintain the child's physical health. It was (and to some extent still is) a common belief that a child's genitals needed to conform to average genitals of a male or female, so in the first 24 hours after birth, doctor's could undergo "extensive reconstructive surgery in order to avoid damage to the child's mental health"&lt;ref name="Of Gender and Genitals"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eee.uci.edu/13f/32555/home/01.+Sterling+-+Of+Gender+and+Genitals.pdf |title=Fausto-Sterling, Anne "Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, &amp;#91;Chapter 3, pp. 44-77&amp;#93; |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; (56). On the other hand, the ISNA claimed there is "no evidence that children who grow up with intersex genitals are worse off psychologically than those who are altered"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/concealment |title=What's wrong with the way intersex has traditionally been treated? |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |date=2004-01-22 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is "no evidence that early surgery relieves parental distress"&lt;ref name="isnafarewell" /&gt; They believed it to be inhuman to choose someone's genitals for them. This being said, the ISNA didn't condemn surgery in general, and believed that people with intersex should be allowed to opt for genital reconstruction, if they want to, when they can fully consent for the operations themselves.&lt;ref name="Shifting the Paradigm of Intersex Treatment" /&gt;

The ISNA advocated a move from what a "Concealment-Centered Model" to a '''Patient-Centered Model'''. This push was to move away from a model that teaches both that "intersex is a rare anatomical abnormality" and that there needs to be immediate surgery to normalize the child's abnormal genitals, and moved toward the idea that "intersex is a relatively common anatomical variation from the 'standard' male and female types". The attempt is to treat intersex as something that is natural, as to not ostracize the intersex community and allow people with intersex to be treated with the same ethical principles that doctors show to any other patient.&lt;ref name="Shifting the Paradigm of Intersex Treatment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/compare |title=Shifting the Paradigm of Intersex Treatment |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Patient-Centered Model believes that "psychological distress is a legitimate concern and should be addressed by properly trained professionals". This means that both people with intersex and family members who feel burdened in any way should seek both the help of counselors trained in [[sex and gender]] issues and the supports from a community of peers experiencing the same situation. This allows a network of support to help everyone through any trying times that might arise. The model also states that "care should be more focused on addressing stigma, not solely gender assignment and genital appearance."&lt;ref name="isnafarewell" /&gt; The Model attempts to much more caring toward people with intersex.&lt;ref name="Shifting the Paradigm of Intersex Treatment" /&gt;

Released in August 2006, the '''Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders''' was a document published in ''Pediatrics'' that mapped out a new standard of care for people with intersex.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee PA, Houk CP, Ahmed SF, Hughes IA |title=Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders.

However, the statement still permits surgeries, and both clinicians&lt;ref name="creighton2014"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/19419899.2013.831214| issn = 1941-9899| volume = 5| issue = 1| pages = 34–43| last1 = Creighton| first1 = Sarah M.| last2 = Michala| first2 = Lina| last3 = Mushtaq| first3 = Imran| last4 = Yaron| first4 = Michal| title = Childhood surgery for ambiguous genitalia: glimpses of practice changes or more of the same?| journal = Psychology and Sexuality| accessdate = 2015-07-19| date = January 2, 2014| url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19419899.2013.831214}}&lt;/ref&gt; and civil society organizations&lt;ref name="interact2016un"&gt;{{Cite web| last = interACT| authorlink = Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth | title = Recommendations from interACT: Advocates for Intersex Youth regarding the List of Issues for the United States for the 59th Session of the Committee Against Torture| date = June 2016| url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_ICS_USA_24552_E.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; question implementation.

===First North American demonstration by intersex people===
Members of ISNA held the first ever North American demonstration about intersex issues: a 1996 demonstration by [[Morgan Holmes]], [[Max Beck]] and others as ''Hermaphrodites with Attitude'' outside the Annual Meeting of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/books/chrysalis/beck Hermaphrodites with Attitude Take to the Streets], Intersex Society of North America, October 1996&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgiann Davis]] describes how, when the intersex movement began, "medical professional refused to engage intersex activists", and how rapidly the movement's strategy developed. "By the year 2000, Chase was delivering a plenary address to the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, a group she was once protesting against... It marked the first time an activist's perspective was solicited by organizers of a major medical conference."&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt;

The 1996 demonstration is now commemorated internationally as [[Intersex Awareness Day]].&lt;ref name="Star Online 1"&gt;{{cite web | title = The 14 days of intersex | publisher = [[Star Observer]] | url = http://www.starobserver.com.au/opinion/2011/10/25/the-14-days-of-intersex/64300 | accessdate = 11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification documents===
ISNA, like the 2013 [[International Intersex Forum#Third Forum, Malta, November–December 2013|International Intersex Forum]] believed that "newborns with intersex should be given a gender assignment as boy or girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/patient-centered |title=What does ISNA recommend for children with intersex? |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their reasoning is that they think it would be impossible to know where male ends and intersex begins or where female ends and intersex begins. They want to "make the world a safe place for intersex kids", and they believe that marking them as a third gender would exile them.&lt;ref name="Shifting the Paradigm of Intersex Treatment" /&gt;

===Publications===
{{main|Hermaphrodites with Attitude}}
ISNA published the journal ''[[Hermaphrodites with Attitude]]'', edited by [[Cheryl Chase (activist)|Cheryl Chase]], between 1994 and 2005.&lt;ref name="isnahwa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hermaphrodites with Attitude|url=http://www.isna.org/library/hwa|publisher=Intersex Society of North America|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue appeared in Winter 1994, comprising 6 pages of articles, analysis and case studies, including articles by people with lived experience, activists, doctors and academics. It was distributed to subscribers in five countries and 14 States of the United States.&lt;ref name="hwa1"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Hermaphrodites with Attitude | title = Hermaphrodites with Attitude | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | date = 1994 | url = http://www.isna.org/files/hwa/winter1995.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full archives are available online.

===Language===
In a significant shift from publishing a regular journal titled ''Hermaphrodites with Attitude'' and demonstrating using the same name, the last stated goal of the organization was to eradicate what the organization deemed as "misleading language".&lt;ref name="isnafarewell" /&gt; The ISNA claimed that nomenclature based on [[hermaphroditism]] was stigmatizing&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/hermaphrodite |title=Is a person who is intersex a hermaphrodite? |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; to intersex individuals, as well as potentially panic-inducing to parents of intersex children. The suggested solution put forth by the ISNA was to restructure the system of intersex taxonomy and nomenclature to not include the words 'hermaphrodite', 'hermaphroditism', 'sex reversal', or other similar terms.&lt;ref name="http://www.isna.org/node/979"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/node/979 |title=Getting Rid of "Hermaphroditism" Once and For All |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "standard division of many intersex types into true hermaphroditism, male pseudohermaphroditism, and female pseudohermaphroditism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dreger AD, Chase C, Sousa A, Gruppuso PA, Frader J |title=Changing the nomenclature/taxonomy for intersex: a scientific and clinical rationale |journal=Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=729–33 |date=August 2005  |pmid=16200837 |doi=10.1515/jpem.2005.18.8.729}}&lt;/ref&gt; is described by the ISNA and its advocates as confusing and clinically problematic.&lt;ref name="http://www.isna.org/node/979"/&gt;

The ISNA attempted to dispel what it sees as "harmful language" by providing information on intersex definitions and prevalence. The Intersex Society of North America stated that the term [[hermaphrodite]] is a "mythological term" and a "physiologic impossibility"; true hermaphrodites cannot exist.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While some intersex people seek to reclaim the word "hermaphrodite" with pride to reference themselves (much like the words "dyke" and "queer" have been reclaimed by LBGT people), the ISNA suggested that be avoided. They believed that it will not help the cause of intersex rights and could in fact be counter productive as people would not understand that word is being used as an attempt to empower intersex people, not classify them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===International work===
{{further|Intersex rights in Colombia}}
ISNA made various efforts to spread intersex activism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gayalliance.org/directory/intersex-society-of-north-america-isna.html |title=Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) |publisher=Gay Alliance |accessdate=2014-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310203029/http://www.gayalliance.org/directory/intersex-society-of-north-america-isna.html |archive-date=2015-03-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were a resource for a 1999 [[Intersex rights in Colombia|Colombian court case decision]] on surgical guidelines for intersex children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case 1 Part I (Sentencia SU-337/99)|url=http://www.isna.org/node/166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure and succession==
{{main|Intersex civil society organizations}}
By 2008, even though ISNA felt that they were able to come to a "consensus on improvements to [medical] care" for people born intersex with a large amount of the medical community, they ran into many problems in implementing these ideas.  There was a "concern among many healthcare professionals, parents, and mainstream healthcare system funders that ISNA's views are biased", and many of these people feared that they would be shunned by colleagues if it was found out they were associated with the ISNA. The ISNA gave a statement saying that "at present, the new standard of care exists as little more than ideals on paper, thus falling short of its aim[s]" to fulfill its goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/farewell_message |title=Dear ISNA Friends and Supporters |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISNA decided its best course of action was to "support a new organization with a mission to promote integrated, comprehensive approaches to care that enhance the overall health and well-being of persons [who are intersex] and their families." The ISNA transferred all of its remaining funds, assets, and copyrights to [[Accord Alliance]] and then closed.

The [[Accord Alliance]], which opened in April 2008, is a direct successor to ISNA. Its goal is to "improve the way health care is made available" to people born intersex.&lt;ref name="isnafarewell" /&gt;

Writing in ''Sociology of Diagnosis'', [[Georgiann Davis]] describes [[Organisation Intersex International]] (OII) and ISNA as "activist organisations".&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/books.htm?chapterid=1943090 "DSD is a Perfectly Fine Term": Reasserting Medical Authority through a Shift in Intersex Terminology], [[Georgiann Davis]] (2011),  in PJ McGann, David J. Hutson (ed.) Sociology of Diagnosis (Advances in Medical Sociology, Volume 12), Emerald Group Publishing Limited, pp.155-182.&lt;/ref&gt; OII continues today with affiliates in many countries. Other intersex and DSD activist and advocacy organisations also continue their work around the world. Many of those organizations participate in the [[International Intersex Forum]].

The '''LEADER''' programme (an acronym in French meaning ''Links between actions for the development of the rural economy'') is a [[European Union]] initiative to support rural development projects initiated at the local level in order to revitalise rural areas and create jobs. LEADER I ran from 1991–93, LEADER II from 1994–99, and LEADER+ from 2000-2006. In the current programming period (2014-2020), the LEADER method has been extended to cover not only rural but also coastal ([https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/cms/farnet/ FARNET]) and urban areas under the banner of Community-led Local Development (CLLD).

== Operation and objectives ==
LEADER+ projects are managed by '''local action groups''' (LAGs). Each project must involve a relatively small rural area, with a population of between 10,000 and 100,000. In France, the whole country is eligible with the exception of urban areas with over 50,000 inhabitants. France has 140 local action groups.

LEADER+ has three objectives:
* to encourage experiments in rural development
* to support cooperation between rural territories: several LAGs can share their resources
* to network rural areas, by sharing experiences and expertise in the development of rural areas by creating databases, publications and other modes of information exchange

== Methodology==
From 1991 until 2001 the LEADER methodology was developed with the support of the [[European Commission]]'s [[technical assistance]] contractor, [[AEIDL]]. LEADER developed seven principles of local development. [[File:LEADER's 7 principles.jpg|thumb|The 7 principles of the LEADER local development approach]]

These are:
# '''Area-based:''' taking place in a small, homogeneous socially cohesive territory
# '''Bottom-up:''' local actors design the strategy and choose the actions
# '''Public-private partnership:''' LAGs are balanced groups involving public and private-sector actors, which can mobilise all available skills and resources
# '''Innovation:''' giving LAGs the flexibility to introduce new ideas and methods
# '''Integration:''' between economic, social, cultural and environmental actions, as distinct from a sectoral approach
# '''Networking:''' allowing learning among people, organisations and institutions at local, regional, national and European levels
# '''Co-operation:''' among LEADER groups, for instance to share experiences, allow complementarity or to achieve critical mass

==Funding==

* LEADER I (1991–93) supported 217 LAGS with EU funding of €0.442 billion from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund ([[EAGGF]])&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, ''The Leader approach — A basic guide'', Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 2006, {{ISBN|92-79-02044-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* LEADER II (1994–99) supported 906 LAGs with EU funding of €1.755 billion
* LEADER+ (2000–06) supported 893 LAGs with EU funding of €2.105 billion, and a total budget of €5.05 billion

==Follow-up==
In 2013 the LEADER approach, which had developed in a rural context, was extended to apply to urban and coastal areas under the title of [https://enrd.ec.europa.eu/en/themes/clld Community-Led Local Development (CLLD)].

'''''Landdrost''''' was the title of various officials with local jurisdiction in the [[Netherlands]] and a number of former territories in the [[Dutch Empire]]. The term is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] compound, with ''land'' meaning "region" and ''drost'', from [[Middle Dutch]] ''drossāte (droes-state, bloke-castle, stad-holder)'' which originally referred to a lord's chief retainer (who later became the medieval [[seneschal]] or [[Steward (office)|steward]]), equivalent to:
* an [[England|English]] [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] or steward;
* a [[Low German]] ''Drost(e)'' of [[Northern Germany]] ([[cognate]] with [[New High German|German]] ''[[Truchsess]]''); or 
* [[German_people|German]] ''[[Meier]]'' (from [[Latin_language|Latin]] ''[[Majordomo|majordomus]]'').

==Feudal era==
Originally, a drost in the [[Low Countries]] – where various titles were in use for similar offices – was essentially a [[Steward (office)|steward]] or [[seneschal]] under the local lord, exercising various functions depending on the endlessly varied local [[customary law]], e.g. tax collection, policing, [[public prosecutor|prosecution]], and [[Sentence (law)|carrying out sentence]]s.

In many [[Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle|Lower Rhenish and Westphalian]] and [[Lower Saxon Circle|Lower Saxon]] [[Imperial estate|estates]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] the term Landdrost or Drost(e) described the chief executive official of a military, jurisdictional and/or police ambit, representing his lord-paramount of the territory, therefore often appearing with the affix 'land-'. Among the many territories using the term are the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen]], the [[Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim]], the [[County of Mark]], and the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg]]. 

==South Africa==
The office was also introduced in the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Dutch colony]] established at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

However it only came to more gubernatorial significance in some of the [[Boer]] polities that seceded shortly after the British took over the colony, notably:

*[[Graaff-Reinet]] had only one "national" Landdrost, 6 February 1795 – 22 August 1796: Friedrich Carl David Gerotz (1739–1828)
*The [[Utrecht Republic]] had three consecutive Landdrosts: 
**1852 – 1855: Andreas Theodorus Spies (1800–1889), who was already in office before the settlement declared itself a republic
**1855 – February 1856: J.C. Styen 
**February 1856 – 8 May 1858: Andreas Theodorus Spies (2nd time)

A similar gubernatorial role in other Boer polities was played by officials styled ''Kaptyn'' ('captain', in the original sense of Headman).

In the [[Cape Colony]], an ordinance passed in 1827 abolished the old Dutch "landdrost" and "heemraden" courts, instead substituting British-type [[resident magistrate]]s, who would act only in English. "Landdros" is now used as the [[Afrikaans]] term for a [[Magistrate's Court (South Africa)|magistrate]].

==Netherlands under Napoleonic rule==
*[[Drenthe]] province, after Administrators (16 February 1795 – 8 May 1807), had two Landdrosts: 
**8 May 1807 – 1 January 1810  Petrus Hofstede  (b. 1755 – d. 1839) 
**1 January 1810 – 1811  Jan Adriaan, baron van Zuylen van Nijevelt (b. 1776 – d. 1840); next it had Governors 
*[[Friesland]] (Dutch Frisia), after several Administrators, had one Landdrost: 8 May 1807 – February 1811  Regnerus Livius van Andringa de Kempenaer (b. 1752 – d. 1813), next a [[Prefect]] (1811 – 13 December 1813 January: Gijsbert Verstolk van Soelen), then [[Commissaris-generaal|Commissarissen-generaal]]  
*[[Gelderland]], after Administrators (16 February 1795 – 8 May 1807), had Landdrosts:
**8 May 1807 – 14 November 1807: Gerrit Willem Joseph, baron van Lamswerde (b. 1758 – d. 1837) 
**14 November 1807 – 1 January 1811 Johan Arend de Vos van Steenwijk  (b. 1746 – d. 1813) 
**1810 – February 1811 Verstolk van Soelen; next a Prefect (February 1811 – 1 December 1813  Regnerus Livius van Andringa de Kempenaer (b. 1752 – d. 1813), afterwards Governors

*[[Noord Brabant]] ('North Brabant'), after Administrators (16 February 1795 – 8 May 1807) had one Landdrost, 8 May 1807 – 1810: Paul Emanuel Anthony de la Court (b. 1760 – d. 1848), next a Prefect of [[Bouches-du-Rhin]] department (9 July 1810 – 1814  Nicolas, baron Frémin de Beaumont), then Governors
*[[Holland]] (only 1840 divided in the present two provinces North – and South Holland) as such never had a Landdrost; however, while the Amstel, Delf and Texel départements were only under Commissioners, these temporary fractions did: 
**[[Amstelland]], formed in 1807  from Amsterdam and northern part of département Holland, until it was on 9 July 1810 merged with Utrecht into French département [[Zuyderzee]], had one Landdrost, 1807 – 9 July 1810: Jan van Styrum  (b. 1757 – d. 1829) 
**[[Maasland]], in 1807 a département formed from The Hague and southern parts of département of Holland, had a single Landdrost, May 1807 – November 1807: [[Jacob Abraham de Mist]] (b. 1749 – d. 1823), then Prefects (continuing when on 9 July 1810 renamed French département [[Bouches-de-la-Meuse]]) until it was in 1814 abolished

**8 September 1809 – 16 March 1810  François Ermerins  (b. 1753 – d. 1840); next two Prefects of [[Bouches-de-l'Escaut]] (9 July 1810 – 1814), then Governors 
*Meanwhile [[Staats-Limburg|Dutch Limburg]] (which had had one ''Drossard'' as Chief Justice, 1754 – 1794: Philippe Joseph Dieudonné, graaf van Woestenraedt) was simply annexed to France as one of the 'Belgian' provinces, département [[Meuse-Inférieure]] 'Lower Maas (=Meuse)'

==In 19th century Hanover==
In 1823 the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], then in [[personal union]] with the UK, adopted the term for its administrative subdivisions called Landdrostei[en] (sg.[pl.]), each presided over by a Landdrost, with those terms then translated into English as High-Bailiwick and High-Bailiff.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jakob Heinrich Kaltschmidt, ''A new and complete Dictionary of the English and German Languages with two Sketches of Grammar/Neues vollständiges Wörterbuch der englischen und deutschen Sprache nebst einem kurzen Abrisse der englischen und der deutschen Sprachlehre'', 6th, rev. and enriched ed., Leipsic: Otto Holtze, 1875, p. 283. No ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 1885 the terms were replaced in [[Province of Hanover|Hanover]] by the terms [[Regierungsbezirk]] (governorate) and Regierungspräsident (gubernator).

== Post-World War II Dutch-occupied Germany==
After World War II, the old landdrost title was re-used for two extraordinary jurisdictions within the [[Dutch annexation of German territory after World War II|Dutch Occupation Zone in Germany]]. On 22 March 1949, the Allies agreed to let the Netherlands occupy and annex some German border territories. These included the municipalities of Havert, Hillensberg, Millen, Süsterseel, Tüddern (Dutch: Tudderen), Wehr, parts of Höngen, Gangelt, Schumm, Saeffelen as well as Elten and Hoch-Elten.

The Dutch annexation effectively started on 23 April that year, with the following two jurisdictions declared:
*Landdrost of [[Tudderen]] ([[Tüddern]] in German) (directly subordinated to the Dutch government up to September 1951, then to the Governor of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]] province): 1949 – 1963  Hubert M.J. Dassen 
*two Landdrosten of [[Elten]] (subordinated to the Dutch government up to September 1951, then to the Commissioner of the Queen -i.e. Governor- for [[Gelderland]]) 
**April 1949 – October 1961:  Dr. [[Adriaan Blaauboer]]  (b. 1906 – d. 1961)
**October 1961 – August 1963:  Baron Hans Georg Inundat van Tuyll van Serooskerken (b. 1917 – d. 1988)  

This situation lasted until 11 August 1963, when all territories were returned except for minor frontier adjustments, following German agreement to pay war compensation.

== Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders ==
After the creation of the [[Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders]], now part of the province of [[Flevoland]], the newly claimed area was governed by the landdrost of the [[Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders]] ''(Public Body of the Southern IJsselmeer Polders)'' until it was partitioned into municipalities.

The '''Legion of Frontiersmen''' is a voluntary service formed in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in 1905 by Roger Pocock, a former constable with the [[North-West Mounted Police]] and [[Boer War]] veteran.

Prompted by fears of an impending invasion of Britain and the [[British Empire|Empire]], the organisation was founded to be a field intelligence corps on a romanticised conception of the "[[frontier myth|frontier]]" and imperial idealism. Headquartered in London, branches of the Legion of Frontiersmen were formed throughout the empire to prepare patriots for war and to foster vigilance in peacetime. Despite persistent efforts, the Legion never achieved much official recognition, and is unlikely to ever do so.

Casualties in the [[World War I|First World War]] devastated the Legion of Frontiersmen, and except for a brief resurgence in the interwar period, a series of schisms and sectarianism prevented attempts to reinvigorate the movement. In the late 1930s, the Legion of Frontiersmen in Canada was formally affiliated with the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], but after a schism split within the Canadian Frontiersmen, the RCMP severed formal ties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.utoronto.ca/fisher/collections/findaids/pocock.pdf] Dave Mason, University of Toronto Rare Books. Retrieved 4 March 2007; B. W. Shandro, “The Legion of Frontiersmen of the Commonwealth Canada," [http://www.frontiersmenhistorian.info/canada.htm] Retrieved 4 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Various Legion of Frontiersmen groups still exist throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], but as a whole, it has been unable to define its niche in the post-imperial world.

During the First World War, the Legion of Frontiersmen helped raise and fill the ranks of the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]], the [[19th Alberta Dragoons]], the 49th Battalion - Canadian Expeditionary Force (today's [[Loyal Edmonton Regiment]]), the [[210th Battalion (Frontiersmen), CEF|210th Battalion (Frontiersmen)]], - Canadian Expeditionary Force,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/html/gl-ga/index-eng.asp?letter=L&amp;page=1 |title=Canadian Military History Gateway - Glossary |publisher=Cmhg.gc.ca |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saskd.ca/history.htm |title=The Saskatchewan Dragoons |publisher=Saskd.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/royalfus.htm |title=The Royal Fusiliers in 1914-1918 |publisher=1914-1918.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Newfoundland Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/greatwar/articles/paramilitary.html |title=Paramilitary Groups |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uniforms ==
[[Image:Nd-3-5588b FMen Edmonton 1930.jpg|thumb|right|Edmonton Command, 1930]]
The earliest official description of an authorized uniform for a Canadian unit is noted in ''The Frontiersman'',
(December 1912, page 223) describing Vernon and Okanagan Command’s uniform as follows:
“Shirt Tunic – To be of substantial material, colour navy blue; leather buttons; nickel shoulder chains. Breeches or (Trousers) – Any shade of khaki.
Footwear – Brown leather; any combination that affords cover as high as the calves.
Headdress – Straight brim Stetson, any shade of brown, with leather band and regimental crest and monogram.
Accessories – Brown leather fringed gauntlets; silk blue and white “bird’s-eye” neckerchief; regulation LF holster.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofthequeen.com/Canada-LegionOfFrontiersmen.html |title=Legion of Frontiersmen - Boer War Veteran |publisher=Soldiers of the Queen |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Current dress uniform is generally centred around a cavalry blues theme - complete with shoulder chains. This is either worn with a russett-coloured beret, an SD cap or a colonial-pattern '[[Campaign hat|Lemon Squeezer]]' (Smokey Bear hat). [[Jodhpurs]] and [[riding boots]] are worn by the 'Legion of Horse' when 'mounted'.

The most up to date uniform is that of the Scottish Command in South Wales who sport a (neutral in nature) black utility uniform for parade occasions and MTP (Multi Terrain Pattern) for their standard uniform, both worn with the russet coloured beret that they have become associated with. This newest approach to the appearance of the LoF in the modern age has made sure that their numbers keep increasing along with their reputation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Decorations ==
Different branches of the legion, in different parts of the Commonwealth award medals within their units and occasionally to external branches, commands or units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontiersmen.org.au/downloads/ribbon_chart.pdf |title=Ribbon Chart |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127074404/http://frontiersmen.org.au/downloads/ribbon_chart.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These medals are not part of any government honours system and should not be treated or claimed as any kind of official military decoration. These medals are much like those of the Freemasons,&lt;ref&gt;[Trevor I. Harris(2006) {{ISBN|978-0-9554447-0-8}} {{ISBN|0955444705}}]&lt;/ref&gt; valued only by members.

'''Mission Mercal''' (officially launched on 24 April 2003) is a [[Bolivarian Missions|Bolivarian Mission]] established in [[Venezuela]] under the government of [[Hugo Chávez]].  The Mission involves a state-run company called ''Mercados de Alimentos, C.A.'' (MERCAL), which provides subsidised food and basic goods through a nationwide chain of stores. In 2010 Mercal was reported as having 16,600 outlets, "ranging from street-corner shops to huge warehouse stores," in addition to 6000 [[soup kitchen]]s. Mercal employs 85,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Business Week]]'', March 11, 2010, [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_12/b4171046603604.htm A Food Fight for Hugo Chavez]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mission Mercal stores and cooperatives are mostly located in impoverished areas and sell generic-branded foods at discounts as great as 50%.  While the company is heavily funded by the government, the goal is to become self-sufficient by replacing food imports with products from local farmers, small businesses, and cooperatives (many of whom have received microcredits from Mercal). This [[endogenous]] development is central to Chávez's stated goal of non-capitalistic development from the bottom up.

{{OR section|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Escasez en Venezuela, Mercal.JPG|200px|thumbnail|right|Shoppers waiting in line at a Mercal store.]]
The antecedent operations to Mission Mercal began operations following the economic hardships following the [[Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003|strike/lockout of 2002]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldia.es/2003-01-28/venezuela/venezuela0.htm|title=Chávez asegura que podría empuñar las armas para defender la revolución|date=28 January 2006|publisher=''El País''|accessdate=19 March 2009|quote="Ya estamos desarrollando e instalando un sistema integral pleno, nacional, de distribución de alimentos y de medicinas, para que no haya escasez"|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until that period, Venezuela's food production and distribution systems were primarily managed by large national corporations, a situation homologous to the present reality in Western nations such as the United States or Europe. As most corporations supported the strike/lockout, which was aimed at politically damaging Chávez, most of the food-related corporations joined the protests and ceased their operations. On the 25 April 2003 broadcast of the television show [[Aló Presidente]], Chávez expressed his outrage at Venezuela's lack of [[food sovereignty]] and the resultant vulnerability to the agenda of major food corporations, which was manifest in closed supermarkets, growing malnutrition, and food shortages. “This offensive served us a lot because we learned from the imperialism’s attack, from the Venezuelan oligarchy, and from those who were supporting the aggression against Venezuela and who would liked to have defeated us with hunger. [We learned] that we did not have a gram or a grain of anything, of food reserves.  Before any natural, political or social disaster, Venezuela did not have then food reserves," Chávez stated.
[[File:Súper Mercal de Judibana.JPG|left|200px|thumbnail|Súper Mercal in [[Judibana]].]]
Afterwards, in the depths of the oil shutdowns and general turmoil of 2002, Mission Mercal's reach expanded rapidly. The Armed Forces were integral in providing logistical support in moving, procuring, warehousing, and distributing food. Military bases and supply depots were used as food supply nodes, while military barracks became storage centers. Chávez acknowledged this by stating that "the army of Venezuela took to the street, gave of themselves and made the task easier with their technology, their human resources, their means of transportation and their installations for storing food.”
With initially only three Mercals (markets) and two warehouses, Mission Mercal (following its permanent and official inauguration in 2003) quickly multiplied to the point where 12,500 Mercalitos (mini-Mercals), 13,392 Mercals, hundreds of cooperatives, 31 Supermercals (mega markets), and 102 vast warehouses comprised a sprawling distribution system serving millions of ''barrio'' dwellers.

In 2006 some 11.36 million Venezuelans benefited from Mercal food programs on a regular basis. At least 14,208 Mission Mercal food distribution sites were spread throughout Venezuela, and 4,543 metric tons of food distributed each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2006/05/04/eco_ava_04A703401.shtml|title=Datanálisis: Mercal es el lugar preferido para comprar alimentos|date=4 May 2006|publisher=''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]''|accessdate=19 March 2009|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food and discounts offered ==

Victuals offered by Mission Mercal include everything from meat and dairy (including powdered milk and cheese), to fresh produce, preserved foodstuffs, grains and cereals, fruits, vegetable oils, and mineral salts. These goods are offered in Mercal-affiliated establishments at discounts averaging between 25% to 50%.

==Shortages==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5833">[[File:Favela SP.jpg|thumb|São Paulo favelas. Much of the Moser Gender Planning Framework is focused in improving women's conditions in the Third World.]]The '''Moser Gender Planning Framework''' is a tool for [[gender analysis]] in development planning. It was developed by [[Caroline Moser]]. The goal is to free women from subordination and allow them to achieve equality, equity, and empowerment.&lt;ref name=WBank/&gt;

==Origin==
Moser developed the Framework for a [[Gender and Development]] (GAD) approach to development planning in the 1980s while working at the Development Planning Unit (DPU) of the [[University of London]]. Working with Caren Levy, she expanded it into a methodology for gender policy and planning. Moser and Levy published ''A Theory and Method of Gender Planning – Meeting Women's Practical and Strategic Needs'' as a DPU working paper in 1986.&lt;ref name=March1999/&gt; The framework is based on Moser's concepts of gender roles and gender needs, and her views on the ways policies should approach gender and development planning.&lt;ref name=IFLO/&gt;

==Overview==
The Moser framework follows the Gender and Development approach in emphasizing the importance of gender relations. As with the WID-based [[Harvard Analytical Framework]], it includes collection of quantitative empirical facts. Going further, it investigates the reasons and processes that lead to conventions of access and control. The Moser Framework includes gender roles identification, gender needs assessment, disaggregating control of resources and decision making within the household, planning for balancing the triple role, distinguishing between different aims in interventions and involving women and gender-aware organizations in planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv
 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbvFLBTaZS0C&amp;pg=PA125
 |title=Sex, gender, becoming: post-apartheid reflections
 |first=Karin |last=Van Marle
 |publisher=PULP |year=2006
 |page=126
 |ISBN=0-9585097-5-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The framework acknowledges a political element to gender planning, and assumes that the process will have to deal with conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://en.wsic.ac.cn/baike/1649.htm
 |title=Gender Analysis Framework (3) – Moser's Framework
 |publisher=Chinese Women's Research Network
 |date=2010-12-07
 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The framework rests on three basic concepts: the triple role of women, practical and strategic gender needs and categories of WID/GAD policy approaches. The triple role consists of reproductive, productive and community-managing activities. Practical needs are ones that, if met, help women in current activities. Strategic needs are needs that, if met, transform the balance of power between men and women. Different categories of WID/GAD policy approach, which may or may not be appropriate, include welfare (top-down handouts), equity, anti-poverty, efficiency and empowerment.&lt;ref name=March1999/&gt;

==Tools==
The framework provides six tools. 
*Tool 1 identifies gender roles: what women, men, boys and girls do in various productive, reproductive and community-managing activities. 
*Tool 2 identifies the practical and strategic needs of women. 
*Tool 3 defines an access and control profile for resources and benefits of economic activity. 
*Tool 4 examines the impact that a new policy, project or program will have on the three roles. A change addressing one area may affect others in a positive or negative sense. 
*Tool 5 looks at how welfare, equity, anti-poverty, efficiency or empowerment approaches will address practical or strategic needs. The approaches are not mutually exclusive. 
* Tool 6 looks at way women and gender-aware organisations and individuals can be involved in the process.&lt;ref name=WBank/&gt;

==Limitations==
Although widely used, the framework has been subject to some criticism. The concept of gender roles may tend to obscure the concept of gender relationships. It may give a sense of a stable balance, acceptance of each person's normal activities and rights, when in fact there is ongoing negotiation, conflict and compromise. The framework does not consider evolution of the socioeconomic structure over time. The framework only addresses gender inequality and does not consider other types of inequality such as caste, class or race.&lt;ref name=IFLO/&gt;  

[[Naila Kabeer]] has argued that the triple role concept obscures the distinction between activity and outcome. For example, the outcome of child care could be achieved by the mother at home, by a communal creche or through paid private or state facilities. These are very different in terms of their effect on women.&lt;ref name=March1999/&gt;

The '''Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States''' ('''OECS'''; French: ''Organisation des États de la Caraïbe orientale'', '''OECO''') is an [[Intergovernmental organization|inter-governmental organisation]] dedicated to economic harmonisation and integration, protection of human and legal rights, and the encouragement of [[good governance]] between countries and dependencies in the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the Eastern [[Caribbean]]. It also performs the role of spreading responsibility and liability in the event of natural disaster.

The main organ of the OECS is the Commission, which is based in [[Castries]], the [[capital city]] of [[Saint Lucia]].

== History ==
OECS was created on 18 June 1981, with the [[Treaty of Basseterre]], which was named after [[Basseterre|the capital city]] of [[St. Kitts and Nevis]]. OECS is the successor of the Leewards Islands' political organisation known as the [[West Indies Associated States]] (WISA).

One prominent aspect of OECS economic bloc has been the accelerated pace of trans-national integration among its member states.

All of the members-states of the OECS (except for Martinique) are either full or associate members of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) and were among the second group of countries that joined the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME). Martinique is currently negotiating to become an associate member of the Caribbean Community.

== Membership ==
OECS currently has ten Eastern Caribbean members, which together form a near-continuous [[archipelago]] across the [[Leeward Islands]] and [[Windward Islands]]. [[Anguilla]], the [[British Virgin Islands]] and [[Martinique]] are only associate members of OECS. Diplomatic missions of the OECS do not represent the associate members. For all other purposes, associate members are treated as equals of full members.

Six of the members were formerly [[Colony|colonies]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Three others, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, and [[Montserrat]] remain [[British overseas territories|overseas territories of the UK]] while Martinique, is a part of the French Republic as an overseas [[Overseas department|department]] and [[Overseas region|region of France]]. Eight of the ten members consider [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] to be sovereign ([[Dominica]] is a [[republic]] with a [[President of Dominica|President]]). There is no requirement for the members to have been British colonies; however, the close historical, cultural and economic relationship fostered by almost all of them having been British colonies is as much a factor in the membership of the OECS as their geographical proximity. 

All seven full members are also the founding members of the OECS, having been a part of the organisation since its founding on 18 June 1981. The British Virgin Islands was the first associate member, joining on 22 November 1984 and Anguilla was the second, joining in 1995. Martinique became an associate member on April 12, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;Caribbean 360, April 12, 2016, [http://www.caribbean360.com/news/martinique-joins-oecs Martinique now a member of OECS] &lt;/ref&gt; the first non-British or formerly British territory in the OECS.&lt;ref name="Martinique OECS membership"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/regional/martinique-oecs-membership-described-as-historic/ |title=Martinique OECS membership described as ‘historic’ |publisher=Dominica News Online |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oecsbusinessfocus.com/an-interview-with-dr-didacus-jules-director-general-oecs-part-2/|title=AN INTERVIEW WITH DR.

=== Possible future memberships ===
Although almost all of the current full and associate members are past or present British dependencies, other islands in the region have expressed interest in becoming associate members of the OECS. The first was the [[United States Virgin Islands]], which applied for associate membership in February 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact92/wf930258.txt|format=TXT|title= CIA World Factbook 1992 via the Libraries of the Universities of Missouri-St. Louis|quote=Scroll to "Member of" section|publisher=Umsl.edu|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and requested that US Federal Government allow the territory to participate as such.&lt;ref name="Special Committee approves draft texts on Tokelau, US Virgin Islands"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2002/gacol3066.doc.htm |title=Special Committee Approves Draft Texts On Tokelau, United States Virgin Islands, Guam &amp;#124; Meetings Coverage And Press Releases |publisher=Un.org |date=2002-06-17 |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it was felt by the US government that it was not an appropriate time to make such a request. However, the US Virgin Islands remained interested in the OECS and, as of 2002, stated that it would revisit the issue with the US government at a later date.&lt;ref name="Special Committee approves draft texts on Tokelau, US Virgin Islands"/&gt; In 2001, [[Saba]], an island of the [[Netherlands Antilles]], decided to seek membership in the OECS. Saba's Island Council had passed a motion on May 30, 2001 calling for Saba's membership in the organisation and subsequently on June 7, 2001, the Executive Council of Saba decided in favour of membership. Saba's senator in the Netherlands Antilles parliament was then asked to present a motion requesting the Antillean parliament to support Saba's quest for membership. In addition to the support from the Antillean parliament, Saba also required a dispensation from the government of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] to become an associate member of the OECS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedailyherald.com/news/daily/e18/oecs18.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030121093557/http://thedailyherald.com/news/daily/e18/oecs18.html |date=January 21, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saba's bid for membership was reportedly supported by St. Kitts and Nevis and discussed at the 34th meeting of OECS leaders in Dominica in July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/caribbean/807551-1.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930205000/http://www.allbusiness.com/caribbean/807551-1.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2001, [[Sint Maarten]], another part of the Netherlands Antilles, explored the possibility of joining the OECS. After learning of Saba's intentions to join, St. Maarten suggested exploring ways in which Saba and St. Maarten could support each other in their pursuit of membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montserratreporter.org/fra0901-4.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041220141343/http://www.montserratreporter.org/fra0901-4.htm |date=December 20, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the prospective members have become associate members as yet, but Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Maarten do participate in the meetings of the Council of Tourism Ministers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecs.org/Documents/communiques_meetings/39th_authmeeting_communique.pdf |format=PDF|title=Communiqué 39th Meeting of the OECS Authority|publisher=Oecs.org|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as the Forum of Tourism Ministers of the Eastern Caribbean, along with representatives of [[Saint Martin (France)|Saint-Martin]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecs.org/Press%20Releases/news_ocot%20meeting%20end.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political union with Trinidad and Tobago===
On 13 August 2008 the leaders of Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines announced their intention to pursue a sub-regional political union within CARICOM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grenada PM arrives in Trinidad |publisher=[[Caribbean News Agency]] (CANA) |url=http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/28701/2008-08-13.html |accessdate=2008-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821154839/http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/28701/2008-08-13.html |archivedate=2008-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Manning-as host and 'unifier' Trinidad PM meets OECS leaders to discuss unity initiative Trinidad Express Newspaper - By Rickey Singh | url = http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_opinion?id=161363222 | accessdate=2008-10-24}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As part of the preliminary discussions the Heads of Government for the involved states announced that 2011 would see their states entering into an economic union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trinidad PM meets OECS leaders to discuss unity initiative Trinidad PM meets OECS leaders to discuss unity initiative |publisher=[[Caribbean News Agency]] (CANA) |url=http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/30910/2008-10-23.html |accessdate=2008-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030011851/http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/30910/2008-10-23.html |archivedate=2010-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NationNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationnews.com/life/312418478580604.php |title=Leaders mum on T&amp;T, OECS plan |accessdate=2008-10-30 |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2008-10-30 |work=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]] |pages= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320101726/http://www.nationnews.com/life/312418478580604.php |archivedate=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was however derailed by a change of government in Trinidad and Tobago in 2010.

===Venezuela seeking membership===
In 2008 the heads of the OECS also received a request from [[Venezuela]] to join the grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BBC Caribbean News in Brief - OECS considers Venezuela request | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2008/11/081121_nibnov21pm.shtml|publisher=Bbc.co.uk | accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OECS Director General [[Len Ishmael]] confirmed Venezuela's application was discussed at the 48th Meeting of the OECS Authority held in Montserrat. But she said OECS decision makers within the sub-region were yet to determine whether membership should be granted for Venezuela.

== Organs ==

===Secretariat===
[[Image:sm sec 300x150jpg.jpg|thumb|200px|OECS Secretariat building.]]
The functions of the Organization are set out in the Treaty of Basseterre and are coordinated by the Secretariat under the direction and management of the Director General.

The OECS functions in a rapidly changing international economic environment, characterised by [[globalisation]] and trade liberalisation which are posing serious challenges to the economic and social stability of their small island members.
 
It is the purpose of the Organisation to assist its Members to respond to these multi-faceted challenges by identifying scope for joint or coordinated action towards the economic and social advancement of their countries.
 
The restructuring of the Secretariat was informed by considerations of cost effectiveness in the context of the need to respond to the increasing challenges placed on it, taking into account the limited fiscal capacities of its members. The Secretariat consists of four main Divisions responsible for: External Relations, Functional Cooperation, Corporate Services and Economic Affairs. These four Divisions oversee the work of a number of specialised institutions, work units or projects located in six countries: Antigua/Barbuda, Commonwealth of Dominica, St Lucia, Belgium, Canada, and the United States of America.

In carrying out its mission, the OECS works along with a number of sub-regional and regional agencies and institutions. These include the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB); the Caribbean Community (Caricom) Secretariat; the Caribbean Regional Negotiating Machinery (RNM) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnm.org/ |title=Welcome To OTN |publisher=Crnm.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).

===Director General===
The authority within the OECS Secretariat is led by the Director General. The current Director General of the OECS is Dr. Didacus Jules (Registrar and Chief Executive Officer of the Barbados-based Caribbean Examinations Council), who took his new position on 1 of May 2014. The former Dr. [[Len Ishmael]] demitted the office at the end of December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecs.org/media-center/press-releases/secretariat/817-oecs-authority-selects-dr-didacus-jules-as-new-director-general |title=Authority Selects Dr. Didacus Jules as New Director-General |publisher=OECS |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140611132109/http://www.oecs.org/media-center/press-releases/secretariat/817-oecs-authority-selects-dr-didacus-jules-as-new-director-general |archivedate=2014-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court===
The [[Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court|Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC)]], which was created during the era of WISA, today handles the judicial matters in the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. When a trial surpasses the stage of High Court in an OECS member state, it can then be passed on to the ECSC at the level of Supreme court. Cases appealed from the stage of ECSC Supreme Court will then be referred to the jurisdiction of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. The [[Caribbean Court of Justice|Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ)]] was established in 2003, but constitutional changes need to be put in place before the CCJ becomes the final Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecsupremecourts.org.lc/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813095033/http://www.ecsupremecourts.org.lc/ |date=August 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other agencies===
* [[Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority]]

==Projects==

===Passport===
A common OECS Passport was originally planned for January 1, 2003&lt;ref name="OECS Economic Union"&gt;[http://www.oecs.org/econunion.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its introduction was delayed. At the 38th OECS Authority Meeting in January 2004, the Secretariat was mandated to have the two companies expressing an interest in producing the common passport ([[De La Rue|De La Rue Identity Systems]] and the [[Canadian Banknote Company]]&lt;ref name="Movement towards common OECS passport"&gt;[http://www.oecs.org/Press%20Releases/news_39Authoruty_1stday.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) make presentations at the next  (39th) Authority Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecs.org/Documents/communiques_meetings/38th_authmeeting_Communique.pdf |format=PDF|title=Communiqué – 38th Meeting of the OECS Authority|publisher=Oecs.org|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 39th Meeting the critical issue of the relationship between the OECS passport and the [[CARICOM passport]] was discussed&lt;ref name="Movement towards common OECS passport" /&gt; and at the 40th OECS Authority Meeting in November 2004, the OECS Heads of Government agreed to give CARICOM a further 6&amp;nbsp;months (until May 2005) to introduce a CARICOM Passport. Failure to introduce the CARICOM Passport by that time would have resulted in the OECS moving ahead with its plans to introduce the OECS Passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecs.org/assets/40th_authmeeting_Communique.pdf |format=PDF|title=Communiqué – 40th Meeting of the OECS Authority|publisher=Oecs.org|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the CARICOM Passport was first introduced in January 2005 (by Suriname) then the idea of the OECS Passport was abandoned. Had the passport been introduced however it would not have been issued to [[Economic Citizenship|Economic Citizen]]s within the OECS states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecs.org/Documents/communiques_meetings/35%20authority%20meeting%20communique.pdf |format=PDF|title=Communiqué – 35th Meeting of the OECS Authority|publisher=Oecs.org|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would also be unknown if the islands under British sovereignty would join the scheme (all British passports have the same European design).

===Economic union===
The decision to establish an [[Economic and monetary union|economic union]] was taken by OECS Heads of Government at the 34th meeting of the Authority held in Dominica in July 2001. At the 35th meeting of the Authority in Anguilla in January 2002, the main elements of an economic union implementation project were endorsed. The project was expected to be implemented over a two-year period with seven of the nine OECS member states (i.e. [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Montserrat]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[St. Lucia]] and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]) participating in the economic union initiative. The remaining two member states, [[Anguilla]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]], would not have participated immediately, but would have requested time to consider the issue further.&lt;ref name="OECS Economic Union"/&gt; In 2003, work had been initiated on the central issue of the creation of new Treaty arrangements to replace the Treaty of Basseterre which established the OECS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecs.org/lib_econunion_series.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the elements of the project was the creation of a technical committee for a draft OECS Economic Union Treaty. This technical committee was inaugurated on May 4, 2004 and began designing the draft Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecs.org/Press%20Releases/news_EUcommitte_1stmeeting.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== OECS Economic Treaty ====
The new OECS Economic Union Treaty was finally presented at the 43rd OECS Meeting in St. Kitts on June 21, 2006.&lt;ref name="OECS Unveils New Economic Union Treaty"&gt;[http://oecs.org/Press%20Releases/news_new_treaty_unveiled.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current draft Treaty was commended at the meeting, but the Authority directed the formulation of some additional provisions to allow a role for national parliamentary representatives (both government and opposition) of the Member States in the form of a regional Assembly of Parliamentarians. This body, it was felt, was necessary to act as a legislative filter to the Authority in its law making capacity. The Heads further directed that the Treaty be reviewed by a meeting of members of the Task Force, Attorneys General, the draftsperson for the Treaty and representatives of the OECS Secretariat.

The presentation of the Treaty at the Meeting was followed by the signing of a Declaration of Intent to implement the Treaty by the Heads of Government or their representatives (except that of the British Virgin Islands). It was agreed in the Declaration, that implementation of the Treaty would occur only after a year of public consultation, through a mass national and regional education programme with strong political leadership and direction. According to the Declaration, the Treaty was to be signed, and the Economic Union was to be established by July 1, 2007.&lt;ref name="Communiqué 43rd Meeting of the OECS Authority"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecs.org/Documents/communiques_meetings/43rd_authmeeting_communique.pdf  |format=PDF|title=Communiqué – 43rd Meeting of the OECS Authority|publisher=Oecs.org|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Revised treaty ====
This intended deadline was missed, however, and after the signing of the '''Revised Treaty of Basseterre Establishing the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States Economic Union''' on June 18, 2010,&lt;ref name="Jan For 2011 OECS Economic Union"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100623/business/business92.html |title=Jan for 2011 OECS economic union &amp;#124; Business |publisher=Jamaica Gleaner |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OECS leaders sign new Economic Union treaty"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111124092112/http://www.caribbean360.com/news/28799.rss ]&lt;/ref&gt; the newest target date of January 21, 2011 was met when five of the six independent signatory Member States ratified the Treaty.&lt;ref name="OECS Economic Union goes into effect"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111124091804/http://www.caribbean360.com/news/st_lucia_news/191430.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; These were Antigua and Barbuda (December 30, 2010), St. Vincent and the Grenadines (January 12, 2011), St. Kitts and Nevis (January 20, 2011), Grenada (January 20, 2011) and Dominica (January 21, 2011).&lt;ref name="OECS Economic Union Launch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecs.org/regional-integration/press-releases/745-oecs-member-states-achieve-historic-milestone-ahead-of-52nd-authority-meeting- |title=The Eleventh meeting of the OECS Council of Tourism Ministers focuses on implementing the OECS Common Tourism Policy. |publisher=OECS |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for the Treaty to have entered into force at least four of the independent Member States must have ratified it by January 21, 2011.&lt;ref name="OECS Economic Union ratified"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2011/01/110121_oecsunionjan21.shtml |title=BBCCaribbean.com &amp;#124; OECS Economic Union ratified |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montserrat had received entrustments from the United Kingdom to sign the Treaty&lt;ref name="Jan For 2011 OECS Economic Union" /&gt; but is unlikely to be in a position ratify the Treaty before a new constitution comes into force in the territory.&lt;ref name="Montserrat ratification a Work in Progress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trulycaribbean.net/?p=3370 |title=Montserrat ratifying the OECS Economic Union Treaty a "Work in Progress" |publisher=TrulyCaribbean.Net |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the need of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank to temporarily assume control of two indigenous commercial banks in Anguilla, the Chief Minister of Anguilla, Hubert Hughes, announced on August 12, 2013 that Anguilla will seek to join the OECS Economic Union as soon possible in order to fully participate in the strategy of growth conceived by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (which was crafted within the context of the Economic Union).&lt;ref name="Statement by the Chief Minister of Anguilla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eccb-centralbank.org/PDF/ang_chief_minister.pdf |format=PDF |title=STATEMENT BY THE CHIEF MINISTER OF ANGUILLA THE HONOURABLE HUBERT HUGHES on The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank Assuming Control of the Caribbean Commercial Bank (CCB) and the National Bank of Anguilla Ltd (NBA) |date=12 August 2013 |publisher=Eccb-centralbank.org |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was supported in his position by St. Lucia's Prime Minister, Dr. Kenny Anthony, who also called on Anguilla to join the Economic Union to complement its membership of the Currency Union.&lt;ref name="ECCB assumes control of indigenous banks in Anguilla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themontserratreporter.com/anguillas-indigenous-commercial-banks-taken-over-by-eastern-caribbean-central-bank-eccb/ |title=The ECCB Assumes Control of Indigenous Banks in Anguilla |publisher=The Montserrat Reporter |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Provisions of the Treaty ====
The provisions of the Economic Union Treaty prior to its ratification were expected to include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecs.org/Documents/communiques_meetings/Economic_Summit_Comminque.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070630050407/http://www.oecs.org/Documents/communiques_meetings/Economic_Summit_Comminque.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-30 |format=PDF |title=Special OECS Economic Summit Meeting |publisher=Oecs.org |accessdate=2015-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070630050404/http://www.oecs.org/Documents/economic_union/Paper%20No%2017%20-%20Treaty%20of%20Basseterre%20%20OECS%20EU.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The free circulation of goods and trade in services within the OECS
* Free movement of labour by December 2007
* The free movement of capital (via support of the money and capital market programme of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank)
* A regional Assembly of Parliamentarians
* A common external tariff.

Some of these provisions would already have been covered to some extent by the [[CSME]], but some, such as the Assembly of Parliamentarians, would be unique to the OECS. Although some of the provisions would seem to duplicate efforts by the CSME, the Declaration of Intent&lt;ref name="OECS Unveils New Economic Union Treaty"/&gt; and statements by some OECS leaders,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000022/002221.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213000424/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000022/002221.htm |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/oecs_news/oecs_new_treaty.jsp |title=OECS Leaders sign Declaration of Intent to form Economic Union |publisher=Caricom.org |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2015-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019121240/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/oecs_news/oecs_new_treaty.jsp |archivedate=2015-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledge the CSME and give assurance that the OECS Economic Union would not run counter to [[CARICOM]] integration but that it would become seamlessly integrated into the CSME. To this end, the OECS Heads of Government agreed that steps should be taken to ensure that the OECS Economic Union Treaty would be recognised under the [[Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas]], just as the original [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] had recognised the Treaty of Basseterre. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecs.org/Documents/communiques_meetings/43rd_authmeeting_communique.pdf|format=PDF|title=Communiqué – 43rd Meeting of the OECS Authority|publisher=Oecs.org|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was achieved in 2013 at the Twenty-Fourth Inter-Sessional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM held in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, from 18–19 February 2013. At that conference CARICOM leaders adopted the OECS’ Revised Treaty of Basseterre into CARICOM’s Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, which St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister, Ralph Gonsalves said would effectively give CARICOM member states the opportunity of integrating initially with the OECS and taking a seemingly quicker path to integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.caribjournal.com/2013/02/19/can-haiti-jumpstart-caricom/ |title=Can Haiti Jumpstart CARICOM? |publisher=Caribjournal.com |date=2013-02-19 |accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve this the Conference agreed that the Inter-Governmental Task Force (IGTF) revising the Treaty of Chaguaramas would recognise the provisions of the Treaty establishing the Economic Union of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The IGTF was mandated to refer back to the Conference at its next meeting on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2013/pres35_13.jsp |title=ommuniqué issued at the conclusion of the Twenty-Fourth Inter-Sessional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM),18-19 February 2013,Port-au-Prince, Republic of Haiti |publisher=Caricom |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127064143/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2013/pres35_13.jsp |archivedate=2015-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economic Union Treaty's provisions are now expected to establish a Single Financial and Economic Space within which goods, people and capital move freely; harmonize monetary and fiscal policies Member States are expected continue to adopt a common approach to trade, health, education and environment, as well as to the development of such critical sectors as agriculture, tourism and energy.&lt;ref name="OECS Economic Union Launch" /&gt; The Economic Union Treaty (or Revised Treaty as it is sometimes known) will also create two new organs for governing the OCES;  The Regional Assembly (consisting of members of parliaments/legislatures) and  The Commission (a strengthened Secretariat).&lt;ref name="Economic Union Treaty FAQs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stlucia.gov.lc/docs/FAQs_OECS_Integration.pdf |title=Web Portal of the Government of Saint Lucia |publisher=Stlucia.gov.lc |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320001634/http://www.stlucia.gov.lc/docs/FAQs_OECS_Integration.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The free movement of OECS nationals within the subregion is expected to commence in August 2011 after a commitment towards that goal by the Heads of Government at their meeting in May 2011.&lt;ref name="Free movement across OECS by August"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Free-movement-across-OECS-by-August_9077323 |title=Free movement across OECS by August - News |publisher=JamaicaObserver.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127002259/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Free-movement-across-OECS-by-August_9077323 |archivedate=2015-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central Bank==
The majority of the OECS members-states are participants of the [[Eastern Caribbean Central Bank]] (ECCB) monetary authority. The regional central bank oversees financial and banking integrity for the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States economic bloc of states. Part of the bank's oversight lends to maintaining the financial integrity of the [[East Caribbean dollar|East Caribbean dollar (XCD)]]. Of all OECS member-states, only the [[British Virgin Islands]] and [[Martinique]] do not use the East Caribbean dollar as their de facto native currency.

All other members belong to the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.

==Security==
The OECS sub-region has a military support unit known as the [[Regional Security System]] (RSS). It is made up of the independent countries of the OECS along with [[Barbados]]. The unit is based in the island of Barbados and receives funding and training from various countries including the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the [[People's Republic of China]].

==Pharmaceutical Procurement Service==

The Pharmaceutical Procurement Service, also known as the Eastern Caribbean Drug Service, procures medicines and allied health equipment on behalf of the member States.  It has an 840 item product portfolio based on the regional [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pharmaceutical Procurement Scheme |url=https://www.oecs.org/pps-about |website=Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it is said to generate savings of $5 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=OECS health ministers endorse deeper cooperation with French territories |url=https://www.caribbeannewsnow.com/2018/11/04/oecs-health-ministers-endorse-deeper-cooperation-with-french-territories/ |accessdate=18 November 2018 |publisher=Caribbean News Today |date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flag and logo==
The [[flag]] and [[logo]] of the OECS consists of a complex pattern of concentric design elements on a pale green field, focused on a circle of nine inwardly pointed orange triangles and nine outwardly pointed white triangles. It was adopted June 21, 2006, and first raised on that day at [[Basseterre]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecs.org/Press%20Releases/news_new_flag_raised.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Parti 51''''' is a minor [[political party]] in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]] that was founded in the late 1980s under the leadership of Serge Talon. The party proposed the separation of Quebec from Canada in order to seek admission to the [[United States]] as the [[51st state]] of that union.  The party had no success in winning any seat in 1989 election to the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], and in the spring of 1990, asked the Direction of Elections of Quebec to dissolve the party because it no longer had enough members to form an executive committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pum.umontreal.ca/apqc/89_90/crete/crete.htm |title=L'année politique au Québec 1989-1990: La vie des partis |last=Crête |first=Jean |publisher=Les Presses de l'Université de Montréal |language=French |access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the party was relaunched by a [[Saint-Georges, Quebec|Saint-Georges]]-based lawyer, Hans Mercier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L’avocat beauceron Hans Mercier relance le Parti 51|url=http://www.leclaireurprogres.ca/actualites/politique/2017/1/12/l_avocat-beauceron-hans-mercier-relance-le-parti-51-.html|website=L'Éclaireur Progrès|accessdate=28 October 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 2016, [[Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, Quebec|Saint-Georges]] lawyer Hans Mercier re-launched Parti 51, again calling for the annexation of Quebec. By the time of the [[Quebec general election, 2018|2018 election]], the party had an estimated 1,100 members.&lt;ref name="P512018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guidara |first1=Amin |title=Voter pour un Québec américain - La Presse+ |url=http://mi.lapresse.ca/screens/db879cf9-2ca5-4cae-ac73-a7812b8e3028__7C___0.html |accessdate=16 September 2018 |work=La Presse+ |publisher=La Presse |date=27 August 2018 |language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mercier told [[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]] that the times have changed since the party's previous era, as [[Quebec sovereigntism]] has waned in popularity. Mercier argued that Americans would be welcoming of a new Quebec state, and pointed to a survey taken during the Administration of [[George W. Bush]] that suggested nearly 34% of Quebecers would support joining the United States.&lt;ref name="P512018"/&gt;

The '''Provisional Government of Ireland''' ({{lang-ga|Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann}}) was the [[provisional government]] for the administration of [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]] from 16 January 1922 to 5 December 1922. It was a transitional administration for the period between the ratifying of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]]. Its legitimacy was disputed by the Anti-Treaty delegates to [[Second Dáil|Dáil Éireann]].

==Legal formation==

[[Article 17 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty]] begins:
{{quotation|By way of provisional arrangement for the administration of Southern Ireland during the interval which must elapse between the date hereof and the constitution of a Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State in accordance therewith, steps shall be taken forthwith for summoning a meeting of members of Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland since the passing of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and for constituting a provisional Government, and the British Government shall take the steps necessary to transfer to such provisional Government the powers and machinery requisite for the discharge of its duties, provided that every member of such provisional Government shall have signified in writing his or her acceptance of this instrument}}

On 14 January 1922 a meeting of the members elected to the [[House of Commons of Southern Ireland]] was held at the [[Mansion House, Dublin]]. At the meeting the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was ratified by the Irish side in accordance with the Treaty and a Provisional Government was elected for the purposes of Article 17 of the Treaty. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] was appointed its chairman. The Provisional Government took up office two days later on 16 January 1922 when British administration handed over [[Dublin Castle]] to Collins in person. At this time, Westminster had not formally appointed the new Irish ministers or conferred their government with any powers.

These gaps were addressed through the [[Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922]] of the [[British Parliament]] passed on 31 March 1922. It gave the force of law to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], which was scheduled to the Act.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/12/07/98769331.pdf Text of Anglo Irish Treaty (New York Times)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1922/mar/31/clause-1-provisions-for-giving-the-force Final debate on 31 Mar 1922 -accessed 22 Jan 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"An Act to give the force of Law to certain Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, and to enable effect to be given thereto, and for other purposes incidental thereto or consequential thereon."{{spaced ndash}}preamble to the Act&lt;/ref&gt; Section 1(2) of the Act provided that for the purposes of giving effect to Article 17 of the Treaty:
* the British Government could by [[Orders in Council]] transfer powers to the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland;
* the [[Parliament of Southern Ireland]] would be dissolved within four months from the passing of the Act; and
* elections would be held for "the House of the Parliament" to which the Provisional Government would be responsible.

The Act did not give a name to that Parliament but said that in matters within the jurisdiction of the Provisional Government (i.e. only certain matters concerning [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]]), it would have power to make laws in like manner as the Parliament of the Irish Free State when constituted.

By [[Order in Council]] under the Act, the British Government formally transferred powers to the Provisional Government on 1 April 1922. The relevant Order in Council signed on 1 April was the "Provisional Government (Transfer of Functions) Order, 1922". This Order passed on the full authority of the state within Southern Ireland to the Provisional Government, including, for the time being, all the laws that applied to Southern Ireland when under British rule. The Ministerial appointments became official and were announced in [[Iris Oifigiúil]] No.19 of 4 April 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?docID=254 Taoiseach’s Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==

==Political Background==
Under the [[Irish Republic]]'s [[Dáil Constitution]] adopted in 1919, [[Dáil Éireann]] continued to exist after it had ratified the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. In protest at the ratification, [[Éamon de Valera]] resigned the presidency of the Dáil then sought re-election from among its members (to clarify his mandate), but [[Arthur Griffith]] defeated him in the vote and assumed the presidency.
 
Most of the Dáil Ministers became concurrently Ministers of this Provisional Government.  [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] became [[Chairman of the Provisional Government]] (i.e. prime minister). He also remained [[Minister for Finance]] of Griffith's [[Irish republicanism|republican]] administration.

==Handover of Dublin Castle ==
One of the earliest and most remarkable events in the short life of the Provisional Government was the handover of [[Dublin Castle]] to the Provisional Government. For centuries Dublin Castle was the symbol, as well as the citadel, of British rule in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Times17Jan1922"&gt;''The Times'', 17 January 1922 – ''Dublin Castle Handed Over, Irish Ministers in London Today, The King's Message''.&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of its [[Dublin Castle administration|Castle administration]] to the representatives of the Irish people was greatly welcomed in Dublin. It was regarded as a significant outward and visible sign that British rule was ending.&lt;ref name="Times17Jan1922"/&gt; The handover of Dublin Castle occurred on 16 January 1922.&lt;ref name="Times17Jan1922"/&gt; The following is a summary of the account of what happened provided by ''The Times'':&lt;ref name="Times17Jan1922"/&gt;

{{quotation|All Dublin was agog with anticipation. From early morning a dense crowd collected outside the gloomy gates in Dame Street, though from the outside little can be seen of the Castle, and only a few privileged persons were permitted to enter its grim gates....[At half past 1] members of the Provisional Government went in a body to the Castle, where they were received by Lord FitzAlan, the Lord Lieutenant. Mr. Michael Collins produced a copy of the Treaty, on which the acceptance of its provisions by himself and his colleagues was endorsed. The existence and authority of the Provisional Government were then formally and officially acknowledged, and they were informed that the British Government would be immediately communicated with in order that the necessary steps might be taken for the transfer to the Provisional Government of the powers and machinery requisite for the discharge of its duties. The Lord Lieutenant congratulated ... expressed the earnest hope that under their auspices the ideal of a happy, free, and prosperous Ireland would be attained...The proceedings were held in private, and lasted for 55 minutes, and at the conclusion the heads of the principal administrative departments were presented to the members of the Provisional Government}}

The following officiaI communique was afterwards issued from the Castle:&lt;ref name="Times17Jan1922"/&gt;

{{quotation|In the Council Chamber at Dublin Castle this afternoon His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant received Mr. Michael Collins as the head of the Provisional Government provided for in Article 17 of the Treaty of December 6.  Mr. Collins handed to the Lord Lieutenant a copy of the Treaty, on which the acceptance of its provisions by himself and his colleagues had been endorsed and other members of the Provisional Government were then introduced. The Lord Lieutenant congratulated. Mr. Collins and his colleagues and informed them that they were now duly installed as the Provisional Government and that in conformity with Article 17 of the Treaty, he would at once communicate with the British Government, in order that the necessary steps might be taken for the transfer to the Provisional Government of the powers and machinery requisite for the discharge of its duties. He wished them every success in the task that they had undertaken, and expressed the earnest hope that under their auspices the ideal of a happy, free, and prosperous Ireland would be attained}}

On leaving the Castle the members of the Provisional Government again received a great ovation from a largely augmented crowd. They returned to the Mansion House from where the Chairman of the Provisional Government, Michael Collins issued the following statement (referring to nothing less than a ''surrender'' of the Castle):&lt;ref name="Times17Jan1922"/&gt;

{{quotation|The members of the Provisional Government of Ireland received the surrender of Dublin Castle at 1.45 p.m. today. It is now in the hands of the Irish nation. For the next few days the functions of the existing departments of the institution will be continued without in any way prejudicing future action. Members of the Provisional Government proceed to London immediately to meet the British Cabinet Committee to arrange for the various details of handing over. A statement will be issued by the Provisional Government tomorrow in regard to its intentions and policy. – Michael Collins, Chairman}}

At the end of the day's events, the following telegram was sent from the King to the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]:&lt;ref name="Times17Jan1922"/&gt;

{{quotation| Am gratified to hear from your telegram of successful establishment of the Provisional Government in Ireland. Am confident that you will do all in your power to help its members accomplish the task that lies before them. -George R.}}

==Accountability==
There was never again ''"a meeting of members of the Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland"'' after 14 January 1922 and neither the Treaty nor the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 provided that the Provisional Government was or would be accountable to any such body. On 27 May 1922 Lord Fitzalan, in accordance with the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 formally dissolved the [[Parliament of Southern Ireland]] and by proclamation called ''"a Parliament to be known as and styled the Provisional Parliament"''.&lt;ref name="DCU Website"&gt;Source: Macardle (1999), pg 718 and [http://www.dcu.ie/~foxs/irhist/may_1922.htm DCU Website.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212182946/http://www.dcu.ie/~foxs/irhist/may_1922.htm |date=12 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922, the Provisional Government did become accountable to that Provisional Parliament. Therefore, between its formation on 14 January 1922 and 19 September 1922 (when the Provisional Parliament first met) the Provisional Government was responsible to no parliament at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/History_of_Government/Second_D%C3%A1il.html Second Dáil], Department of the Taoiseach&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the Provisional Government were also members of the Republican [[Dáil]] and that parliament held meetings into June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/en.toc.D.S2.html Dates of sittings, Jan–June 1922]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dáil]] had no legitimacy in British law and under its own laws was the parliament to which another government was accountable – the [[Aireacht]] ([[Irish Republic]] Government).

In November 1922, when refusing a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]] and eight other IRA men who had been sentenced to death by a court-martial established by the Provisional Government, the [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]] considered the existence of a Provisional Government and its authority to act as proposed and execute the nine.
:''Now we have what is called a Provisional Government in Ireland, and although for the time being it is in a transitional state, it has been formally and legally constituted and derives it validity from the treaty between Great Britain and Ireland and the Act of Parliament confirming that Treaty.'',&lt;ref name="Tim24Nov"&gt;[[The Times]], ''The Childers Case. Judge's Reasons For Refusing Writ''. 24 November 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Fitzalan remained in his post undisturbed for months after the Provisional Government was constituted. In the summer of 1922 he frequently held military reviews of departing British soldiers in the [[Phoenix Park]] outside the then [[Áras an Uachtaráin|Viceregal Lodge]].

==Civil War and Northern Ireland situation==
{{main article|Irish Republican Army and the Anglo-Irish Treaty}}
Anti-treatyites, having opposed the Treaty in the Dáil, mostly withdrew from the assembly and, having formed an opposition "republican government" under Éamon de Valera, began a political campaign from March 1922. At the same time the powerful IRA Army Executive divided, and its anti-Treaty members refused to be bound by the Dáil vote that had ratified it. Barracks that were being evacuated by the British army, in line with the Treaty, were sometimes taken over by anti-Treaty forces. The [[Dunmanway killings]] in April emphasised the government's lack of control. In May 1,200 Garda Síochána recruits mutinied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercierpress.ie/Civic_Guard_Mutiny/624/ McCarthy, B. "The Civic Guard Mutiny" 2012, Mercier Press] {{ISBN|9781781170458}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A force led by [[Rory O'Connor (Irish republican)|Rory O'Connor]] occupied four central buildings in Dublin on 14 April. The Provisional Government ignored this challenge to its authority, hoping that the occupiers would realise that they had achieved nothing, and leave. Instead some incidents at the [[Four Courts]] in late June led to the open outbreak of the [[Irish Civil War]] on 28 June.

The Provisional Government covertly supplied arms to the IRA in [[Northern Ireland]] in an attempt to maintain IRA support elsewhere. This undeclared conflict was formally ended by the "Craig-Collins Agreement" of 30 March 1922,&lt;ref&gt;http://sarasmichaelcollinssite.com/mcccagreement.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but Collins continued to supply arms until shortly before his death in August 1922. Provisional Government policy changed between trying to persuade the [[Government of Northern Ireland]] to join a re-united Ireland and trying to overthrow it. A major concern was the welfare of Catholics in Northern Ireland, who were distrustful of the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] that was formed in late 1921 to deal with the IRA there. Collins's support for the IRA was limited to defensive actions from 2 August.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.difp.ie/docs/volume/1/1922/325.htm Volume 1, Documents on Irish Foreign Policy Volume I, 1919 -1922 (Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, 1998); National Archives file NAI DT S1801A&lt;/ref&gt; The Government lifted, then re-imposed and then lifted the "Belfast Boycott", designed to end the sale of Northern Irish goods in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Documents on Irish Foreign Policy Volume I, 1919 -1922 (RIA, Dublin, 1998); [http://difp.ie/browse-volumes/Volume.asp?VolumeID=1&amp;st=ye&amp;yr=1922 1922 documents online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Irish general election, 1922|general election]] on 16 June 1922, held just before the civil war, the [[Second Irish Provisional Government]] took power until the creation of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922.

By mid-1922, Collins in effect laid down his responsibilities as President of the Provisional Government to become Commander-in-Chief of the [[Irish Army|National Army]], a formal structured uniformed army that formed around the pro-Treaty [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. As part of those duties, he travelled to his native [[County Cork]]. En route home on 22 August 1922, at Béal na mBláth (an [[Irish language]] placename that means 'the Mouth of Flowers'), he was killed in an [[ambush]]. He was 31 years old. After Collins' and Griffith's deaths in August 1922, [[W. T. Cosgrave]] became both Chairman of the Provisional Government and President of Dáil Éireann, and the distinction between the two posts became irrelevant.

On 6 December 1922, the Irish Free State came into being, and the Provisional Government became the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]], presided over by a prime minister called the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Joseph|title=Ireland, 1912–1985: Politics and Society|date=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521377412|page=94|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=KiIZ_x8IWQUC&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]] unanimously exercised its right under the Treaty to opt out the Free State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Austen|title=The Belfast Agreement: A Practical Legal Analysis|date=2000|publisher=The Belfast Press|page=68|url=http://austenmorgan.com/Assets/PDFs/Belfast_Agreement.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">The '''Republican Spelling System''' (in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Ejaan Republik'', when written in the current spelling system, or ''edjaan Republik'', when written in this spelling system) was the orthography used by Indonesian from 17 March 1947. This spelling was also called ''Soewandi Spelling'' (in Indonesian: ''edjaan Soewandi'') after the Indonesian Minister of Education at the time.

This spelling replaced the earlier spelling system, the [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System]], which was in force from 1901.

The differences between the Van Ophuijsen Spelling System and this system are:
* The vowel {{IPA|[u]}}, which in the Van Ophuijsen Spelling System was written as ''oe'', became ''u'', for example ''goeroe'' became ''guru''.
* The glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, which was written as ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' in the van Ophuijsen Spelling System, was written as ''k'' in Republican Spelling, for example ''tak'' (formerly ''ta&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''), ''pak'' (formerly ''pa&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''), ''maklum'' (formerly ''ma'lum'') and ''rakyat'' (formerly ''ra'jat'').
* [[Reduplication|reduplicated]] words could be written using the numeral ''2'', for example ''ubur2'', ''ber-main2'' and ''ke-barat2-an''.
* Both the prefix 'di-' and the preposition 'di' were written without a space after the preposition or prefix. Thus, the preposition ''di'' (for example ''dirumah'' and ''disawah'') was not differentiated from the prefix ''di-'' (for example ''dibeli'' and ''dimakan'').

Soewandi Spelling was in force from 1947 until 1972, when it was replaced by the [[Perfected Spelling System]] (also called ''EYD'' or ''Ejaan yang Disempurnakan'') when [[Mashuri Saleh]] became Minister of Education and Culture. On 23 May 1972, Mashuri legalized the usage of the Perfected Spelling System, replacing Soewandi Spelling. This event was marked by changing the road sign at the front of his office from ''Djl Tjilatjap'' to ''Jl. Cilacap''.

'''Rumi Verjee, Baron Verjee''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (born 1957) is a British businessman, philanthropist and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] member of the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/working-peerages-announced |title=Working peerages announced – Press releases |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=1 August 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Uganda]], Rumi moved to the UK as a child before studying at [[Downing College, Cambridge]].

==Early life==
Rumi Verjee was born in Uganda and spent his early childhood in [[Kenya]] before coming to Britain. Many of the Verjee family assets were seized under [[Idi Amin]]'s regime in 1972.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alibhai |first=Yasmin |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/fd23a2ca-ecb0-11e1-81f4-00144feab49a.html |title=Starting over |work=Financial Times |date=24 August 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Haileybury College]], Hertford, and [[Downing College, Cambridge]] where he gained a BA in Law, before being [[called to the Bar]] from [[Middle Temple]].&lt;ref name="asiantimesonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiantimesonline.co.uk/news.html?groupId=7&amp;newsId=1272 |title=A philanthropist's passion for success |publisher=Asiantimesonline.co.uk |date=15 February 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012054730/http://www.asiantimesonline.co.uk/news.html?groupId=7 |archivedate=12 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Aged 27, Verjee approached [[Tom Monaghan]] at a conference in the US, and persuaded him to sell the [[franchising]] rights to [[Domino's Pizza]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="ft" /&gt; Verjee launched the chain in Britain and it now employs over 20,000 people in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominos.uk.com/aboutus.aspx |title=Domino's Pizza :: About us |publisher=Dominos.uk.com |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821041436/http://www.dominos.uk.com/aboutus.aspx |archivedate=21 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1311763/ugandan-born-lord-vejee-uk-tycoon |title=How Ugandan-born Lord Vejee became a UK tycoon |publisher=newvision.co.uk |date=16 January 2018 |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verjee sold his stake in the firm in 1989, and went on to oversee the development of the [[Brompton Hospital]] site. From 1993 until 1997, Verjee, alongside the singer [[Elton John]], co-owned [[Watford F.C.]]&lt;ref name="asiantimesonline"/&gt; In 1995, he bought [[Thomas Goode (tableware)|Thomas Goode]], which holds two royal warrants and has over 160 years experience in iconic glassworks.&lt;ref name="unltd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unltd.org.uk/2013/05/04/rumi-verjee-thomas-goode-co/ |title=Rumi Verjee: Thomas Goode &amp; Co |publisher=Unltd.org.uk |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="theweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/87406/moser-160-years-of-iconic-glassworks |title=Moser: 160 years of iconic glassworks |publisher=theweek.co.uk |date=16 Jan 2018 |accessdate=16 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Verjee established a UK Charity, [[The Rumi Foundation]], in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charity Details|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1115154&amp;subid=0|website=beta.charitycommission.gov.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation supports humanitarian work through education, innovation and knowledge building. Its work is principally focussed in the UK but has also supported projects in India, East Africa and South America.

In keeping with its aims, the Foundation has supported a number of initiatives including:

In 2009, Verjee was awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] for his charitable work.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=59090 |date=13 June 2009 |page=8 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jun/13/queens-birthday-honours-list-dbe-and-cbe |title=Queen's birthday honours list: Order of the British Empire, Dame (DBE) and Commander (CBE)  |work=The Guardian |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[British Olympic Association]] appointed Verjee to its advisory board ahead of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;ref name="unltd" /&gt;

In 2015, it was announced that Verjee had become an adviser to [[MassChallenge]], the world's biggest startup accelerator programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass Challenge|url=http://masschallenge.org/about/advisors|website=Mass Challenge|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

The '''''Schutzstaffel''''' ('''SS'''; also stylized as [[File:Sig runes thin.png|10px]] with [[Armanen runes]]; {{IPA-de|ˈʃʊtsˌʃtafl̩|-|De-Schutzstaffel.ogg}}; literally "Protection Squadron") was a major [[paramilitary]] organization under [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in [[Nazi Germany]], and later throughout [[German-occupied Europe]] during [[World War II]]. It began with a small guard unit known as the ''Saal-Schutz'' ("Hall Security") made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925 [[Heinrich Himmler]] joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (1929–45) it grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of security, surveillance, and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe.

The two main constituent groups were the ''[[Allgemeine SS]]'' (General SS) and [[Waffen-SS]] (Armed SS). The ''Allgemeine SS'' was responsible for enforcing the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]] and general policing, whereas the Waffen-SS consisted of combat units within Nazi Germany's military. A third component of the SS, the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' (SS-TV), ran the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. Additional subdivisions of the SS included the [[Gestapo]] and the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) organizations. They were tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi state, the neutralization of any opposition, policing the German people for their commitment to [[Nazi ideology]], and providing domestic and foreign intelligence.

The SS was the organization most responsible for the genocidal killing of [[Holocaust victims|an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other victims]] in [[the Holocaust]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}} Members of all of its branches committed [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] during World War II (1939–45). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the [[International Military Tribunal]] at Nuremberg to be criminal organizations. [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, was found guilty of crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.

==Origins==

===Forerunner of the SS===
By 1923, the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) led by [[Adolf Hitler]] had created a small volunteer guard unit known as the ''Saal-Schutz'' (Hall Security) to provide security at their meetings in [[Munich]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=228}}{{sfn|Michael|Doerr|2002|p=356}} The same year, Hitler ordered the formation of a small bodyguard unit dedicated to his personal service. He wished it to be separate from the "suspect mass" of the party, including the paramilitary ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' ("Storm Battalion"; SA), which he did not trust.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=14, 16}} The new formation was designated the ''Stabswache'' (Staff Guard).{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=14}} Originally the unit was composed of eight men, commanded by [[Julius Schreck]] and [[Joseph Berchtold]], and was modeled after the [[Erhardt Naval Brigade]], a ''[[Freikorps]]'' of the time. The unit was renamed [[Stoßtrupp-Hitler|''Stoßtrupp'']] (Shock Troops) in May 1923.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=16}}{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=16}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1486, Hitler-Putsch, München, Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[NSDAP]] supporters and stormtroopers in Munich during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], 1923]]

The ''Stoßtrupp'' was abolished after the failed 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempt by the NSDAP to seize power in Munich.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=10}} In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organize a new bodyguard unit, the ''Schutzkommando'' (Protection Command).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=26}} It was tasked with providing personal protection for Hitler at NSDAP functions and events. That same year, the ''Schutzkommando'' was expanded to a national organization and renamed successively the ''Sturmstaffel'' (Storm Squadron), and finally the ''Schutzstaffel'' (Protection Squad; SS).{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=26–29}} Officially, the SS marked its foundation on 9 November 1925 (the second anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch).{{sfn|Koehl|2004|p=34}} The new SS was to provide protection for NSDAP leaders throughout Germany. Hitler's personal SS protection unit was later enlarged to include combat units.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17, 19}}

===Early commanders===
Schreck, a founding member of the SA and a close confidant of Hitler, became the first SS chief in March 1925.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=604}} On 15 April 1926, [[Joseph Berchtold]] succeeded him as chief of the SS. Berchtold changed the title of the office to ''Reichsführer-SS'' (Reich Leader-SS).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=30}} Berchtold was considered more dynamic than his predecessor, but became increasingly frustrated by the authority the SA had over the SS.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=32}} This led to him transferring leadership of the SS to his deputy, [[Erhard Heiden]], on 1 March 1927.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=12}} Under Heiden's leadership, a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=32}}

Between 1925 and 1929, the SS was considered to be a small ''Gruppe'' (battalion) of the SA.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=45–46}} Except in the Munich area, the SS was unable to maintain any momentum in its membership numbers, which declined from 1,000 to 280 as the SA continued its rapid growth.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=32–33}} As Heiden attempted to keep the SS from dissolving, [[Heinrich Himmler]] became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler displayed good organizational abilities compared to Heiden.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=45–46}} The SS established [[List of Gauleiters|a number]] of [[Gau (territory)|''Gau'']]s (regions or provinces). The SS-Gaus consisted of ''SS-Gau Berlin'', ''SS-Gau Berlin Brandenburg'', ''SS-Gau Franken'', ''SS-Gau Niederbayern'', ''SS-Gau Rheinland-Süd'', and ''SS-Gau Sachsen''.{{sfn|Miller|Schulz|2012|pp=1–2}}

===Himmler appointed===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-054-53A, Nürnberg, Reichsparteitag.jpg|thumb|[[Heinrich Himmler]] (with glasses, to the left of [[Adolf Hitler]]) was an early supporter of the NSDAP.]]
With Hitler's approval, Himmler assumed the position of ''Reichsführer-SS'' in January 1929.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=18}}{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=47}} There are differing accounts of the reason for Heiden's dismissal from his position as head of the SS. The party announced that it was for "family reasons."{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=113}} Under Himmler, the SS expanded and gained a larger foothold. He considered the SS an elite, ideologically driven National Socialist organization, a "conflation of [[Teutonic knights]], the [[Jesuits]], and [[Japanese Samurai]]".{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|pp=272–273}} His ultimate aim was to turn the SS into the most powerful organization in Germany and most influential branch of the party.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=45–47, 300–305}} He expanded the SS to 3,000 members in his first year as its leader.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|pp=272–273}}

In 1929, the ''[[SS-Hauptamt]]'' (main SS office) was expanded and reorganized into five main offices dealing with general administration, personnel, finance, security, and race matters. At the same time, the SS-Gaus were expanded into three ''SS-Oberführerbereiche'' areas, namely the ''SS-Oberführerbereich Ost'', ''SS-Oberführerbereich West'', and ''SS-Oberführerbereich Süd''.{{sfn|Miller|Schulz|2012|pp=2–3}} The lower levels of the SS remained largely unchanged. Although officially still considered a sub-organization of the SA and answerable to the ''[[Stabschef]]'' (SA Chief of Staff), it was also during this time that Himmler began to establish the independence of the SS from the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=308–314}} The SS grew in size and power due to its exclusive loyalty to Hitler, as opposed to the SA, which was seen as semi-independent and a threat to Hitler's hegemony over the party, mainly because they demanded a "second revolution" beyond the one that brought the NSDAP to power.{{sfn|Baranowski|2010|pp=196–197}} By the end of 1933, the membership of the SS reached 209,000.{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1991|p=901}} Under Himmler's leadership the SS continued to gather greater power as more and more state and party functions were assigned to its jurisdiction. Over time the SS became answerable only to Hitler, a development typical of the organizational structure of the entire Nazi regime, where legal norms were replaced by actions undertaken under the ''[[Führerprinzip]]'' (leader principle), where Hitler's will was considered to be above the law.{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1991|p=903}}

In the latter half of 1934, Himmler oversaw the creation of ''SS-Junkerschule'' ([[Junker schools]]), institutions where SS officer candidates received leadership training, political and ideological indoctrination, and military instruction. The training stressed ruthlessness and toughness as part of the SS value system, which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men and taught them self-confidence.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=606}} The first schools were established at [[Bad Tölz]] and [[Braunschweig]], with additional schools opening at [[Klagenfurt]] and [[Prague]] during the war.{{sfn|Allen|2002|p=112}}

The SS was regarded as the NSDAP's elite unit.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|pp=146, 147}} In keeping with the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]], in the early days all SS officer candidates had to provide proof of [[Aryan race#Nazism|Aryan ancestry]] back to 1750 and for other ranks to 1800.{{sfn|Stackelberg|2002|p=116}} Once the war started and it became more difficult to confirm ancestry, the regulation was amended to just proving the candidate's grandparents were Aryan, as spelled out in the [[Nuremberg Laws]].{{sfn|Jacobsen|1999|pp=82, 93}} Other requirements were complete obedience to the Führer and a commitment to the German people and nation.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=62–67}} Himmler also tried to institute physical criteria based on appearance and height, but these requirements were only loosely enforced, and over half the SS men did not meet the criteria.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=63–65}} Inducements such as higher salaries and larger homes were provided to members of the SS, since they were expected to produce more children than the average German family as part of their commitment to NSDAP doctrine.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=19}}

[[File:Gruft der Wewelsburg (10573265394).jpg|thumb|The crypt at [[Wewelsburg]] was repurposed by Himmler as a place to memorialize dead SS members.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=115}} Artwork commemorating the Holocaust hangs on the walls. ]]

Commitment to SS ideology was emphasized throughout the recruitment, membership process, and training.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|pp=148–149}} Members of the SS were indoctrinated in the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and were taught that it was necessary to remove from Germany people deemed by that policy as inferior.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=65–66}} [[Esoteric]] rituals and the awarding of regalia and insignia for milestones in the SS man's career suffused SS members even further with Nazi ideology.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|pp=150–151}} Members were expected to renounce their Christian faith, and Christmas was replaced with a [[Christmas in Nazi Germany|solstice celebration]].{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=93}} Church weddings were replaced with SS ''Ehewein'', a pagan ceremony invented by Himmler.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=94}} These pseudo-religious rites and ceremonies often took place near SS-dedicated monuments or in special SS-designated places.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=608}} In 1933, Himmler bought [[Wewelsburg]], a castle in [[Westphalia]]. He initially intended it to be used as an SS training centre, but its role came to include hosting SS dinners and neo-pagan rituals.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=111–113}}

The SS ideology included the application of brutality and terror as a solution to military and political problems.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=21}} The SS stressed total loyalty and obedience to orders unto death. Hitler used this as a powerful tool to further his aims and those of the NSDAP. The SS was entrusted with the commission of atrocities, illegal activities, and war crimes. Himmler once wrote that an SS man "hesitates not for a single instant, but executes unquestioningly&amp;nbsp;..." any ''Führer-Befehl'' (Führer order).{{sfn|Himmler|1936|p=134}} Their official motto was ''"[[Meine Ehre heißt Treue]]"'' (My Honour is Loyalty).{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=60–61}}

As part of its race-centric functions during World War II, the SS oversaw the isolation and displacement of [[Jews]] from the populations of the conquered territories, seizing their assets and deporting them to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and [[Ghettos#Jewish ghettos|ghettos]], where they were used as [[slave labor]] or immediately killed.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1999|pp=82, 93}} Chosen to implement the [[Final Solution]] ordered by Hitler, the SS were the main group responsible for the institutional killing and [[democide]] of more than 20 million people during [[the Holocaust]], including approximately 5.2 million{{sfn|Rummel|1992|pp=12–13}} to 6 million{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}} Jews and 10.5 million [[Slavs]].{{sfn|Rummel|1992|pp=12–13}} A significant number of victims were members of other racial or ethnic groups such as the 258,000 [[Romani people|Romani]].{{sfn|Rummel|1992|pp=12–13}} The SS was involved in killing people viewed as threats to [[Nazi eugenics|race hygiene]] or NSDAP ideology, including the mentally or physically handicapped, homosexuals, and political dissidents. Members of trade unions and those perceived to be affiliated with groups that opposed the regime (religious, political, social, and otherwise), or those whose views were contradictory to the goals of the NSDAP government, were rounded up in large numbers; these included clergy of all faiths, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], [[Communism|Communists]], and [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]] members.{{sfn|Rummel|1992|p=12}} According to the judgments rendered at the [[Nuremberg trials]] as well as many [[war crime]]s investigations and trials conducted since then, the SS was responsible for the majority of Nazi war crimes. In particular, it was the primary organization which carried out the Holocaust.{{sfn|International Military Tribunal|1946}}

==Pre-war Germany==
After Hitler and the NSDAP came to power on 30 January 1933, the SS were considered a state organization and a branch of the government.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}} Law enforcement gradually became the purview of the SS, and many SS organizations became [[de facto]] government agencies.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=157}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-054-16, Reinhard Heydrich.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Reinhard Heydrich]] was Himmler's protégé and a leading SS figure until his assassination in 1942.]]

The SS established a [[police state]] within Nazi Germany, using the secret state police and security forces under Himmler's control to suppress resistance to Hitler.{{sfn|Hein|2015|pp=66–71}} In his role as [[Minister President of Prussia]], [[Hermann Göring]] had in 1933 created a Prussian [[secret police]] force, the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'' or [[Gestapo]], and appointed [[Rudolf Diels]] as its head. Concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, Göring handed over its control to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} Also on that date, in a departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. Himmler named his deputy and protégé [[Reinhard Heydrich]] chief of the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Heydrich also continued as head of the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD; security service).{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=61}}

The Gestapo's transfer to Himmler was a prelude to the [[Night of the Long Knives]], in which most of the SA leadership were arrested and subsequently executed.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1984|pp=13–14}} The SS and Gestapo carried out most of the killings. On 20 July 1934, Hitler detached the SS from the SA, which was no longer an influential force after the purge. The SS became an independent elite corps of the NSDAP, answerable only to Hitler. Himmler's title of ''Reichsführer-SS'' now became his actual rank, equivalent to the rank of [[Generalfeldmarschall|field marshal]] in the army (his previous rank was ''[[Obergruppenführer]]'').{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=313, 316}} As Himmler's position and authority grew, so did his de facto rank.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 17, 26–27, 30, 46–47}}

On 17 June 1936, all police forces throughout Germany were united under the purview of Himmler and the SS.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=157}} Himmler and Heydrich thus became two of the most powerful men in the country's administration.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|p=90}} Police and intelligence forces brought under their administrative control included the SD, Gestapo, ''[[Kriminalpolizei]]'' (Kripo; criminal investigative police), and ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Orpo; regular uniformed police).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|1995|pp=814–815}} In September 1939, the security and police agencies, including the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (SiPo; security police) and SD (but not the Orpo), were consolidated into the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA), headed by Heydrich.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=470}} This further increased the collective authority of the SS.{{sfn|Hein|2015|pp=70–71}}

In September 1939, the authority of the SS expanded further when the senior SS officer in each military district also became its chief of police.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1984|p=61}} Most of these [[SS and police leader]]s held the rank of SS-''[[Gruppenführer]]'' or above, and answered directly to Himmler in all SS matters within their district. Their role was to police the population and oversee the activities of the SS men within their district.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|pp=144, 148, 169, 176–177}} By declaring an emergency, they could bypass the district administrative offices for the SS, SD, SiPo, ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' (SS-TV; concentration camp guards), and Orpo, thereby gaining direct operational control of these groups.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=165}}

During ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (9–10 November 1938), SS security services clandestinely coordinated violence against Jews as the SS, Gestapo, SD, Kripo, SiPo and regular police did what they could to ensure that while Jewish synagogues and community centers were destroyed, Jewish-owned businesses and housing remained intact so that they could later be seized.{{sfn|Read|2005|pp=512–514}} In the end, thousands of Jewish businesses, homes, and graveyards were vandalized and looted, particularly by members of the SA. Some 500 to 1,000 synagogues were destroyed, mostly by arson.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=584}} On 11 November, Heydrich reported a death toll of 36 people, but later assessments put the number of deaths at up to two thousand.{{sfn|Read|2005|p=515}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=590}} On Hitler's orders, around 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps by 16 November.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=591}} It is likely that as many as 2,500 of these people died in the following months.{{sfn|Read|2005|p=515}} It was at this point that the SS state began in earnest its campaign of terror against political and religious opponents, who they imprisoned without trial or judicial oversight for the sake of "security, re-education, or prevention".{{sfn|Hildebrand|1984|pp=61–62}}{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=85}}

===Hitler's personal bodyguards===
{{main article|Adolf Hitler's bodyguard}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H15390, Berlin, Kaserne der LSSAH, Vergatterung.jpg|thumb|Troop inspection in Berlin of ''[[Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler]]'', 1938]]

As the SS grew in size and importance, so too did Hitler's personal protection units.{{sfn|Spielvogel|1992|pp=102–108}} Three main SS groups were assigned to protect Hitler. In 1933, his larger personal bodyguard unit (previously the [[1st SS-Standarte]]) was called to Berlin to replace the Army Chancellery Guard, assigned to protect the [[Chancellor of Germany]].{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=8, 9}} [[Sepp Dietrich]] commanded the new unit, previously known as SS-Stabswache Berlin; the name was changed to ''SS-Sonderkommando Berlin''. In November 1933, the name was changed to ''Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler''. In April 1934, Himmler modified the name to ''[[Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]]'' (LSSAH). The LSSAH guarded Hitler's private residences and offices, providing an outer ring of protection for the Führer and his visitors.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=9, 12, 17–19}} LSSAH men manned sentry posts at the entrances to the old [[Reich Chancellery]] and the new Reich Chancellery.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=157, 160, 165}} The number of LSSAH guards was increased during special events.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=166}} At the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]], Hitler's residence in the [[Obersalzberg]], a large contingent of the LSSAH patrolled an extensive cordoned security zone.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=181–186}}

From 1941, forward, the ''Leibstandarte'' became four distinct entities, the Waffen-SS division (unconnected to Hitler's personal protection but a formation of the Waffen-SS), the Berlin Chancellory Guard, the SS security regiment assigned to the Obersalzberg, and a Munich-based bodyguard unit which protected Hitler when he visited his personal apartment and the [[Brown House, Munich|Brown House]] NSDAP headquarters in Munich.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17–19}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=157, 160, 165, 166, 181–186}} Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=19, 33}}

Two other SS units composed the inner ring of Hitler's personal protection. The ''[[SS-Begleitkommando des Führers]]'' (Escort Command of the Führer), formed in February 1932, served as Hitler's protection escort while he was travelling. This unit consisted of eight men who served around the clock protecting Hitler in shifts.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=32, 48, 57}} Later the ''SS-Begleitkommando'' was expanded and became known as the ''Führerbegleitkommando'' (Führer Escort Command; FBK). It continued under separate command and remained responsible for Hitler's personal protection.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=36–48}} The ''[[Führer Schutzkommando]]'' (Führer Protection Command; FSK) was a protection unit founded by Himmler in March 1933.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=288}} Originally it was charged with protecting Hitler only while he was inside the borders of [[Bavaria]]. In early 1934, they replaced the ''SS-Begleitkommando'' for Hitler's protection throughout Germany.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=32}} The FSK was renamed the ''Reichssicherheitsdienst'' (Reich Security Service; RSD) in August 1935.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=36}} [[Johann Rattenhuber]], chief of the RSD, for the most part took his orders directly from Hitler.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=36}} The current FBK chief acted as his deputy. Wherever Hitler was in residence, members of the RSD and FBK would be present. RSD men patrolled the grounds and FBK men provided close security protection inside. The RSD and FBK worked together for security and personal protection during Hitler's trips and public events, but they operated as two groups and used separate vehicles.{{sfn|Felton|2014|pp=32–33}} By March 1938, both units wore the standard field grey uniform of the SS.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=36, 48}} The RSD uniform had the SD diamond on the lower left sleeve.{{sfn|Felton|2014|p=18}}

===Concentration camps founded===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H26996, KZ Dachau, Verbrennungsofen.jpg|thumb|Former prisoners at [[Dachau concentration camp]] pose at the camp crematorium, May 1945]]
The SS was closely associated with Nazi Germany's concentration camp system. On 26 June 1933, Himmler appointed SS-''[[Oberführer]]'' [[Theodor Eicke]] as [[commandant]] of [[Dachau concentration camp]], one of the first [[Nazi concentration camps]].{{sfn|Padfield|2001|pp=128–129}} It was created to consolidate the many small camps that had been set up by various police agencies and the NSDAP to house political prisoners.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=95}} The organizational structure Eicke instituted at Dachau stood as the model for all later concentration camps.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=85}} After 1934, Eicke was named commander of the ''SS-Totenkopfverbände'' (SS-TV), the SS formation responsible for running the concentration camps under the authority of the SS and Himmler.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=222}} Known as the "Death's Head Units", the SS-TV was first organized as several battalions, each based at one of Germany's major concentration camps. Leadership at the camps was divided into five departments: commander and adjutant, political affairs division, protective custody, administration, and medical personnel.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=63}} By 1935, Himmler secured Hitler's approval and the finances necessary to establish and operate additional camps.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2010|p=22}} Six concentration camps{{efn|[[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]], [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]], and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]].{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=106–108}} }} housing 21,400 inmates (mostly political prisoners) existed at the start of the war in September 1939.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=108}} By the end of the war, hundreds of camps of varying size and function had been created, holding nearly 715,000 people, most of whom were targeted by the regime because of their race.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=366–367}}{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=108–109}} The concentration camp population rose in tandem with the defeats suffered by the Nazi regime; the worse the catastrophe seemed, the greater the fear of subversion, prompting the SS to intensify their repression and terror.{{sfn|Ayçoberry|1999|p=273}}

==SS in World War II==
By the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, the SS had consolidated into its final form, which comprised three main organizations: the ''Allgemeine SS'', ''SS-Totenkopfverbände'', and the [[Waffen-SS]], which was founded in 1934 as the ''[[SS-Verfügungstruppe]]'' (SS-VT) and renamed in 1940.{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=156}} The Waffen-SS evolved into a second German army alongside the [[Wehrmacht]] and operated in tandem with them, especially with the ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (German Army).{{sfn|Stein|2002|pp=285–287}} However, it never obtained total "independence of command", nor was it ever a "serious rival" to the German Army. Members were never able to join the ranks of the German High Command and it was dependent on the army for heavy weaponry and equipment.{{sfn|Stein|2002|pp=18, 287}} Although SS ranks generally had equivalents in the other services, the SS rank system did not copy the terms and ranks used by the Wehrmacht's branches. Instead it used the ranks established by the post-World War I ''Freikorps'' and the SA. This was primarily done to emphasize the SS as being independent from the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Mollo|1991|pp=1–3}}

===Invasion of Poland===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-380-0069-33, Polen, Verhaftung von Juden, Transport.jpg|thumb|left|Polish Jews arrested by the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) and police, September 1939]]

In the September 1939 [[invasion of Poland]], the LSSAH and SS-VT fought as separate mobile infantry regiments.{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=27}} The LSSAH became notorious for torching villages without military justification.{{sfn|Butler|2001|p=45}} Members of the LSSAH committed atrocities in numerous towns, including the murder of 50 Polish Jews in [[Błonie]] and the massacre of 200 civilians, including children, who were machine gunned in [[Złoczew]]. Shootings also took place in [[Bolesławiec]], [[Torzeniec]], [[Goworowo]], [[Mława]], and [[Włocławek]].{{sfn|Rossino|2003|pp=114, 159–161}} Some senior members of the Wehrmacht were not convinced the units were fully prepared for combat. Its units took unnecessary risks and had a higher casualty rate than the army.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=149}} ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Fedor von Bock]] was quite critical; following an April 1940 visit of the ''SS-Totenkopf'' division, he found their battle training was "insufficient".{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=82}} Hitler thought the criticism was typical of the army's "outmoded conception of chivalry."{{sfn|Stone|2011|p=127}} In its defence, the SS insisted that its armed formations had been hampered by having to fight piecemeal and were improperly equipped by the army.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=149}} 

After the invasion, Hitler entrusted the SS with extermination actions codenamed [[Operation Tannenberg]] and [[German AB-Aktion in Poland|AB-Aktion]] to remove potential leaders who could form a resistance to German occupation. The killings were committed by ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (task forces; deployment groups), assisted by local paramilitary groups. Men for the ''Einsatzgruppen'' units were drawn from the SS, the SD, and the police.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=144–145}} Some 65,000 Polish civilians, including [[activist]]s, [[intelligentsia]], scholars, teachers, actors, former officers, and others, were killed by the end of 1939.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=14–15}}{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=109–111}} When the army leadership registered complaints about the brutality being meted out by the ''Einsatzgruppen'', Heydrich informed them that he was acting "in accordance with the special order of the Führer."{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=246}} The first systematic mass shooting of Jews by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' took place on 6 September 1939 during the attack on [[Kraków]].{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=xxxi}}

Satisfied with their performance in Poland, Hitler allowed further expansion of the armed SS formations, but insisted new units remain under the operational control of the army.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|pp=6, 7}} While the ''SS-Leibstandarte'' remained an independent regiment functioning as Hitler's personal bodyguards, the other regiments—''SS-Deutschland'', ''SS-Germania,'' and ''SS-Der Führer''—were combined to form the ''[[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|SS-Verfügungs-Division]]''.{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=32}}{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=149}} A second SS division, the ''SS-Totenkopf'', was formed from SS-TV concentration camp guards, and a third, the [[4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division|''SS-Polizei'']], was created from police volunteers.{{sfn|Stein|2002|pp=33–35}}{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=66}} The SS gained control over its own recruitment, logistics, and supply systems for its armed formations at this time.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=66}} The SS, Gestapo, and SD were in charge of the provisional military administration in Poland until the appointment of [[Hans Frank]] as Governor-General on 26 October 1939.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1984|p=50}}{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=229}}

===Battle of France===
On 10 May 1940, Hitler launched the [[Battle of France]], a major offensive against France and the [[Low Countries]].{{sfn|Hellwinkel|2014|p=9}} The SS supplied two of the 89 divisions employed.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|p=147}} The LSSAH and elements of the SS-VT participated in the ground invasion of the [[Battle of the Netherlands]].{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=61}} Simultaneously, airborne troops were dropped to capture key Dutch airfields, bridges, and railways. In the five-day campaign, the LSSAH linked up with army units and airborne troops after a number of clashes with Dutch defenders.{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=61}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Weill-059-04, Metz, Heinrich Himmler neben Panzer.jpg|thumb|Himmler inspecting [[Sturmgeschütz III]] of the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]] in [[Metz]], France, September 1940]]

SS troops did not take part in the thrust through the [[Ardennes]] and the river [[Meuse]].{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=61}} Instead, the ''SS-Totenkopf'' was summoned from the army reserve to fight in support of ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]]'s [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]] as they advanced toward the [[English Channel]].{{sfn|Butler|2003|p=64}} On 21 May, the British launched an armored counterattack against the flanks of 7th Panzer Division and ''SS-Totenkopf''. The Germans then trapped the British and French troops in a huge pocket at [[Dunkirk]].{{sfn|Manning|1999|p=59}} On 27 May, 4 Company, ''SS-Totenkopf'' perpetrated the [[Le Paradis massacre]], where 97 men of the 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]] were machine gunned after surrendering, with survivors finished off with [[bayonet]]s. Two men survived.{{sfn|Sydnor|1977|p=93}} By 28 May the ''SS-Leibstandarte'' had taken [[Wormhout]], {{convert|10|miles}} from Dunkirk. There, soldiers of the 2nd Battalion were responsible for the [[Wormhoudt massacre]], where 80 British and French soldiers were murdered after they surrendered.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=251}} According to historian Charles Sydnor, the "fanatical recklessness in the assault, suicidal defense against enemy attacks, and savage atrocities committed in the face of frustrated objectives" exhibited by the ''SS-Totenkopf'' division during the invasion were typical of the SS troops as a whole.{{sfn|Sydnor|1977|p=102}}

At the close of the campaign, Hitler expressed his pleasure with the performance of the ''SS-Leibstandarte'', telling them: "Henceforth it will be an honour for you, who bear my name, to lead every German attack."{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=143}} The SS-VT was renamed the Waffen-SS in a speech made by Hitler in July 1940.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=156}} Hitler then authorized the enlistment of "people perceived to be of related stock", as Himmler put it, to expand the ranks.{{sfn|Stein|2002|pp=150, 153}} A number of Danes, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes, and Finns volunteered to fight in the Waffen-SS under the command of German officers.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|pp=213–214}} They were brought together to form the new division ''[[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|SS-Wiking]]''.{{sfn|Stein|2002|pp=150, 153}} In January 1941, the ''SS-Verfügungs'' Division was renamed ''SS-Reich'' Division (Motorized), and was renamed as the ''[[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich]]'' when it was reorganized as a ''[[Panzergrenadier]]'' division in 1942.{{sfn|Mattson|2002|pp=77, 104}}

===Campaign in the Balkans===
In April 1941, the German Army [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]] and [[Battle of Greece|Greece]]. The LSSAH and ''Das Reich'' were attached to separate army [[Panzer corps]]. [[Fritz Klingenberg]], a company commander in the ''Das Reich'', led his men across Yugoslavia to the capital, [[Belgrade]], where a small group in the vanguard accepted the surrender of the city on 13 April. A few days later Yugoslavia surrendered.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=162, 163}}{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=297}} SS police units immediately began taking hostages and carrying out reprisals, a practice that became common. In some cases, they were joined by the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Bessel|2006|pp=110–111}} Similar to Poland, the war policies of the Nazis in the Balkans resulted in brutal occupation and racist mass murder. Serbia became the second country (after [[Estonia]]) declared ''[[Judenfrei]]'' (free of Jews).{{sfn|Bessel|2006|p=110}}

In Greece, the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS encountered resistance from the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) and [[Hellenic Army|Greek Army]].{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=163, 165}} The fighting was intensified by the mountainous terrain, with its heavily defended narrow passes. The LSSAH was at the forefront of the German push.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=163–166}} The BEF evacuated by sea to [[Crete]], but had to flee again in late May when the Germans arrived.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=155}} Like Yugoslavia, the conquest of Greece brought its Jews into danger, as the Nazis immediately took a variety of measures against them.{{sfn|Bessel|2006|p=111}} Initially confined in ghettos, most were transported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in March 1943, where they were killed in the [[gas chamber]]s on arrival. Of Greece's 80,000 Jews, only 20 percent survived the war.{{sfn|Frusetta|2012|p=266}}

==War in the east==
On 22 June 1941, Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Glantz|2001|pp=7–9}} The expanding war and the need to control occupied territories provided the conditions for Himmler to further consolidate the police and military organs of the SS.{{sfn|Bracher|1970|p=409}} Rapid acquisition of vast territories in the East placed considerable strain on the SS police organizations as they struggled to adjust to the changing security challenges.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=64}}

The 1st and 2nd SS Infantry Brigades, which had been formed from surplus concentration camp guards of the SS-TV, and the [[SS Cavalry Brigade]] moved into the Soviet Union behind the advancing armies. At first they fought [[Soviet partisans]], but by the autumn of 1941, they left the anti-partisan role to other units and actively took part in the Holocaust. While assisting the ''Einsatzgruppen'', they formed firing parties that participated in the liquidation of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Windrow|Burn|1992|p=9}}{{sfn|Heer|Naumann|2000|p=136}}

On 31 July 1941, Göring gave Heydrich written authorization to ensure the cooperation of administrative leaders of various government departments to undertake [[genocide]] of the Jews in territories under German control.{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=315}} Heydrich was instrumental in carrying out these exterminations, as the Gestapo was ready to organize deportations in the West and his ''Einsatzgruppen'' were already conducting extensive killing operations in the East.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=164}} On 20 January 1942, Heydrich chaired a meeting, called the [[Wannsee Conference]], to discuss the implementation of the plan.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=696–697}}

During battles in Soviet Union in 1941 and 1942, the Waffen-SS suffered enormous casualties. The LSSAH and ''Das Reich'' lost over half their troops to illness and combat casualties.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=168}} In need of recruits, Himmler began to accept soldiers that did not fit the original SS racial profile.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=171}} In early 1942, ''SS-Leibstandarte'', ''SS-Totenkopf'', and ''SS-Das Reich'' were withdrawn to the West to refit and were converted to ''Panzergrenadier'' divisions.{{sfn|Reynolds|1997|p=9}} The SS-Panzer Corps returned to the Soviet Union in 1943 and participated in the [[Third Battle of Kharkov]] in February and March.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=173}}

===The Holocaust===
[[File:Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942.jpg|link=Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph, 1942|thumb|''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' murder Jews in [[Ivanhorod]], Ukraine, 1942]]

The SS was built on a culture of violence, which was exhibited in its most extreme form by the mass murder of civilians and prisoners of war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|Fritz|2011|pp=69–70, 94–108}} Augmented by personnel from the Kripo, [[Ordnungspolizei|Orpo]] (Order Police), and Waffen-SS,{{sfn|Krausnik|1968|p=77}} the ''Einsatzgruppen'' reached a total strength of 3,000 men. ''Einsatzgruppen'' A, B, and C were attached to [[Army Group North|Army Groups North]], [[Army Group Centre|Centre]], and [[Army Group South|South]]; ''Einsatzgruppe'' D was assigned to the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|11th Army]]. The ''Einsatzgruppe'' for Special Purposes operated in eastern Poland starting in July 1941.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=185}} The historian [[Richard Rhodes]] describes them as being "outside the bounds of morality"; they were "judge, jury and executioner all in one", with the authority to kill anyone at their discretion.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|pp=159–160}} Following Operation Barbarossa, these ''Einsatzgruppen'' units, together with the Waffen-SS and Order Police, engaged in the mass killing of the Jewish population in occupied eastern Poland and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|pp=159–160}}{{sfn|Bessel|2006|pp=118–119}} The greatest extent of ''Einsatzgruppen'' action occurred in 1941 and 1942 in Ukraine and Russia.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=164}} Before the invasion there were five million registered Jews throughout the Soviet Union, with three million of those residing in the territories occupied by the Germans; by the time the war ended, over two million of these had been murdered.{{sfn|Bessel|2006|p=119}}

The extermination activities of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' generally followed a standard procedure, with the ''Einsatzgruppen'' chief contacting the nearest Wehrmacht unit commander to inform him of the impending action; this was done so they could coordinate and control access to the execution grounds.{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1991|p=227}} Initially the victims were shot, but this method proved impracticable for an operation of this scale.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=256–257}} Also, after Himmler observed the shooting of 100 Jews at [[Minsk]] in August 1941, he grew concerned about the impact such actions were having on the mental health of his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found, which led to introduction of [[gas van]]s.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=547}}{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=199}} However, these were not popular with the men, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=243}}

===Anti-partisan operations===
{{further|Bandenbekämpfung}}
In response to the army's difficulties in dealing with Soviet partisans, Hitler decided in July 1942 to transfer anti-partisan operations to the police. This placed the matter under Himmler's purview.{{sfn|Blood|2006|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=625}} As Hitler had ordered on 8 July 1941 that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans, the term "anti-partisan operations" was used as a euphemism for the murder of Jews as well as actual combat against resistance elements.{{sfn|Longerich|2010| p=198}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=626, 629}} In July 1942 Himmler ordered that the term "partisan" should no longer be used; instead resisters to Nazi rule would be described as "bandits".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=627}}

Himmler set the SS and SD to work on developing additional anti-partisan tactics and launched a propaganda campaign.{{sfn|Blood|2006|pp=71–77}} Sometime in June 1943, Himmler issued the ''[[Bandenbekämpfung]]'' (bandit fighting) order, simultaneously announcing the existence of the ''Bandenkampfverbände'' (bandit fighting formations), with SS-''Obergruppenführer'' [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski]] as its chief. Employing troops primarily from the SS police and Waffen-SS, the ''Bandenkampfverbände'' had four principal operational components: propaganda, centralized control and coordination of security operations, training of troops, and battle operations.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=121}} Once the Wehrmacht had secured territorial objectives, the ''Bandenkampfverbände'' first secured communications facilities, roads, railways, and waterways. Thereafter, they secured rural communities and economic installations such as factories and administrative buildings. An additional priority was securing agricultural and forestry resources. The SS oversaw the collection of the harvest, which was deemed critical to strategic operations.{{sfn|Blood|2006|pp=152–154}} Any Jews in the area were rounded up and killed. Communists and people of Asiatic descent were killed presumptively under the assumption that they were Soviet agents.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=628–629}}

===Death camps===
[[File:May 1944 - Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia arrive at Auschwitz-Birkenau.jpg|thumb|left|Jews from [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] arriving at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], 1944]]
After the start of the war, Himmler intensified the activity of the SS within Germany and in Nazi occupied Europe. An increasing numbers of Jews and German citizens deemed politically suspect or social outsiders were arrested.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2010|p=27}} As the Nazi regime became more oppressive, the concentration camp system grew in size and lethal operation, and grew in scope as the economic ambitions of the SS intensified.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2010|pp=26–27}}

Intensification of the killing operations took place in late 1941 when the SS began construction of stationary gassing facilities to replace the use of ''Einsatzgruppen'' for mass killings.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=279–280}} Victims at these new [[extermination camp]]s were killed with the use of carbon monoxide gas from automobile engines.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=283}} During [[Operation Reinhard]], run by officers from the ''Totenkopfverbände'', who were sworn to secrecy, three death camps were built in occupied Poland: [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]] (operational by March 1942), [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]] (operational by May 1942), and [[Treblinka]] (operational by July 1942),{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=283, 287, 290}} with squads of [[Trawniki men]] (Eastern European collaborators) overseeing hundreds of ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' prisoners,{{efn|Not to be confused with ''SS-Sonderkommandos'', ad hoc SS units that used the same name.}} who were forced to work in the gas chambers and crematoria before being murdered themselves.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=141}} On Himmler's orders, by early 1942 the concentration camp at Auschwitz was greatly expanded to include the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide [[Zyklon B]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=295, 299–300}}{{sfn|Wachsmann|2010|p=29}}

For administrative reasons, all concentration camp guards and administrative staff became full members of the Waffen-SS in 1942. The concentration camps were placed under the command of the ''SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt'' ([[SS Main Economic and Administrative Office]]; WVHA) under [[Oswald Pohl]].{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=559}} [[Richard Glücks]] served as the [[Inspector of Concentration Camps]], which in 1942 became office "D" under the WVHA.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=115}} Exploitation and extermination became a balancing act as the military situation deteriorated. The labor needs of the war economy, especially for skilled workers, meant that some Jews escaped the genocide.{{sfn|Gruner|2012|pp=174–175}} On 30 October 1942, due to severe labor shortages, Himmler ordered that large numbers of able-bodied people in the Soviet occupied territories should be taken prisoner and sent to Germany as [[forced labor]].{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=629}}

By 1944, the SS-TV had been organized into three divisions: staff of the concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members in and out of the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|p=265}} This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and [[crimes against humanity]].{{sfn|Stein|2002|pp=258–263}}

==Business empire==
In 1934, Himmler founded the first SS business venture, Nordland-Verlag, a publishing house that released propaganda material and SS training manuals. Thereafter, he purchased [[Allach (porcelain)|Allach Porcelain]], which then began to produce SS memorabilia.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=114}} Because of the labor shortage and a desire for financial gain, the SS started exploiting concentration camp inmates as slave labor.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=119, 120}} Most of the SS businesses lost money until Himmler placed them under the administration of Pohl's ''Verwaltung und Wirtschaftshauptamt Hauptamt'' (Administration and Business office; VuWHA) in 1939.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=115}} Even then, most of the enterprises were poorly run and did not fare well, as SS men were not selected for their business experience, and the workers were starving.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|pp=312–313}} In July 1940 Pohl established the ''[[Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe|Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe GmbH]]'' (German Businesses Ltd; DWB), an umbrella corporation under which he took over administration of all SS business concerns.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=485}} Eventually the SS founded nearly 200 holding companies for their businesses.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=482}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-269, KZ Mauthausen, Häftlinge im Steinbruch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Extermination through labor]]. At [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]], inmates were forced to carry heavy granite blocks out of the quarry on the "Stairs of Death".]]

In May 1941 the VuWHA founded the ''Deutsche Ausrüstungswerke'' GmbH (German Equipment Works; DAW), which was created to integrate the SS business enterprises with the burgeoning concentration camp system.{{sfn|Allen|2002|p=95}} Himmler subsequently established four major new concentration camps in 1941: [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]], [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], and [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]]. Each had at least one factory or quarry nearby where the inmates were forced to work.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=480–481}} Himmler took a particular interest in providing laborers for [[IG Farben]], which was constructing a synthetic rubber factory at [[Monowitz concentration camp|Auschwitz III–Monowitz]].{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=480}} The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=129}} Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=56}} This was typical of the camps, as inmates were underfed and lived under disastrously bad living conditions. Their workload was intentionally made impossibly high, under the policy of [[extermination through labor]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=316}}

In 1942, Himmler consolidated all of the offices for which Pohl was responsible into one, creating the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (''Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt''; WVHA).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=559}} The entire concentration camp system was placed under the authority of the WVHA.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|pp=182–183}} The SS owned Sudetenquell GbmH, a mineral water producer in [[Sudetenland]]. By 1944, the SS had purchased 75 percent of the mineral water producers in Germany and were intending to acquire a monopoly.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=484}} Several concentration camps produced building materials such as stone, bricks, and cement for the SS-owned ''[[Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke]]'' (German Earth And Stone Works; DEST).{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=114–115}} In the occupied Eastern territories, the SS acquired a monopoly in brick production by seizing all 300 extant brickworks.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=484}} The DWB also founded the ''Ost-Deutsche Baustoffwerke'' (East German Building Supply Works; GmbH or ODBS) and ''Deutsche Edelmöbel'' GmbH (German Noble Furniture). These operated in factories the SS had confiscated from Jews and Poles.{{sfn|Allen|2002|p=102}}

The SS owned experimental farms, bakeries, meat packing plants, leather works, clothing and uniform factories, and small arms factories.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=115–116}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=483}} Under the direction of the WVHA, the SS sold camp labor to various factories at a rate of three to six ''[[Reichsmark]]s'' per prisoner per day.{{sfn|Frei|1993|p=128}} The SS confiscated and sold the property of concentration camp inmates, confiscated their investment portfolios and their cash, and profited from their dead bodies by [[August Frank memorandum|selling their hair to make felt]] and melting down their dental work to obtain gold from the fillings.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=116}} The total value of assets looted from the victims of [[Operation Reinhard]] alone (not including Auschwitz) was listed by [[Odilo Globocnik]] as 178,745,960.59 [[Reichsmark]]s. Items seized included 2,909.68 kilograms of gold worth 843,802.75 RM, as well as 18,733.69&amp;nbsp;kg of silver, 1,514&amp;nbsp;kg of platinum, 249,771.50 American dollars, 130 diamond solitaires, 2,511.87 carats of brilliants, 13,458.62 carats of diamonds, and 114&amp;nbsp;kg of pearls.{{sfn|International Military Tribunal|1950}} According to Nazi legislation, Jewish property belonged to the state, but many SS camp commandants and guards stole items such as diamonds or currency for personal gain, or took seized foodstuffs and liquor to sell on the black market.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=67}}

==Military reversals==
On 5 July 1943, the Germans launched the [[Battle of Kursk]], an offensive designed to eliminate the [[Kursk]] salient.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=486}} The Waffen-SS by this time had been expanded to 12 divisions, and most took part in the battle.{{sfn|Bessel|2006|p=143}} Due to stiff Soviet resistance, Hitler halted the attack by the evening of 12 July. On 17 July he called off the operation and ordered a withdrawal.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=488–489}} Thereafter, the Germans were forced onto the defensive as the [[Red Army]] began the liberation of Western Russia.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=68, 70}} The losses incurred by the Waffen-SS and the Wehrmacht during the Battle of Kursk occurred nearly simultaneously with the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Allied assault into Italy]], opening a two-front war for Germany.{{sfn|Fritz|2011|p=350}}

=== Normandy landings ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-263-1580-05, Atlantikwall, Soldaten der Legion "Freies Indien".jpg|thumb|right|[[Indian Legion]] troops of the Waffen-SS guard the [[Atlantic Wall]] in [[Bordeaux]], 21 March 1944.]]

Alarmed by the raids on [[St Nazaire Raid|St Nazaire]] and [[Dieppe Raid|Dieppe]] in 1942, Hitler had ordered the construction of fortifications he called the [[Atlantic Wall]] all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=30}} Concrete gun emplacements were constructed at strategic points along the coast, and wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles were placed on the beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=54–56}} In addition to several static infantry divisions, eleven panzer and ''Panzergrenadier'' divisions were deployed nearby.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=12, 13}}{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=60, 63, 122, 275}} Four of these formations were Waffen-SS divisions.{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=219}} In addition, the ''SS-Das Reich'' was located in [[Southern France]], the LSSAH was in Belgium refitting after fighting in the Soviet Union, and the newly formed panzer division ''[[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend|SS-Hitlerjugend]]'', consisting of 17- and 18-year-old [[Hitler Youth]] members supported by combat veterans and experienced [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s, was stationed west of Paris.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=295}} The creation of the ''SS-Hitlerjugend'' was a sign of Hitler's desperation for more troops, especially ones with unquestioning obedience.{{sfn|Rempel|1989|p=233}}

The [[Normandy landings]] took place beginning 6 June 1944. [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] under ''Generalmajor'' [[Edgar Feuchtinger]], positioned south of [[Caen]], was the only panzer division close to the beaches. The division included 146 tanks and 50 [[assault gun]]s, plus supporting infantry and artillery.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=73}} At 02:00, ''Generalleutnant'' Wilhelm Richter, commander of the [[716th Static Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|716th Static Infantry Division]], ordered 21st Panzer Division into position to counter-attack. However, as the division was part of the armoured reserve, Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from [[OKW]] before he could commit his formation.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=230}} Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09:00, but in the meantime on his own initiative he put together a battle group (including tanks) to fight the British forces east of the [[Orne (river)|Orne]].{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=282}} ''SS-Hitlerjugend'' began to deploy in the afternoon of 6 June, with its units undertaking defensive actions the following day. They also took part in the [[Battle for Caen]] (June–August 1944).{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=297}} On 7–8 and 17 June, members of the ''SS-Hitlerjugend'' shot and killed twenty Canadian prisoners of war in the [[Ardenne Abbey massacre]].{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=73}}

The Allies continued to make progress in the liberation of France, and on 4 August Hitler ordered a counter-offensive ([[Operation Lüttich]]) from [[Vire]] towards [[Avranches]].{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|pp=399–400}} The operation included LSSAH, ''Das Reich'', [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd]], and [[116th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|116th Panzer Divisions]], with support from infantry and elements of the [[17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen|17th SS Panzergrenadier Division ''Götz von Berlichingen'']] under [[SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer|SS-''Oberstgruppenführer'']] [[Paul Hausser]]. These forces were to mount an offensive near [[Mortain]] and drive west through Avranches to the coast. The Allied forces were prepared for this offensive, and an air assault on the combined German units proved devastating.{{sfn|Stein|2002|pp=222–223}} On 21 August, 50,000 German troops, including most of the LSSAH, were encircled by the Allies in the [[Falaise Pocket]].{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=420}} Remnants of the LSSAH which escaped were withdrawn to Germany for refitting.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=197}} [[Liberation of Paris|Paris was liberated]] on 25 August, and the last of the German forces withdrew over the [[Seine]] by the end of August, ending the Normandy campaign.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=1085–1086}}

===Battle for Germany===
Waffen-SS units which had survived the summer campaigns were withdrawn from the front line to refit. Two of them, the [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|9th SS]] and [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Divisions]], did so in the [[Arnhem]] region of Holland in early September 1944. Coincidentally, on 17 September, the Allies launched in the same area [[Operation Market Garden]], a combined airborne and land operation designed to seize control of the lower [[Rhine]].{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=701}} The 9th and 10th Panzers were among the units that repulsed the attack.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|pp=439–442}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J28510, Ardennenoffensive, deutsche Infanterie geht im Wald vor..jpg|thumb|upright|German infantry travel on foot in the Ardennes, December 1944]]

In December 1944, Hitler launched the Ardennes Offensive, also known as the [[Battle of the Bulge]], a significant counterattack against the western Allies through the Ardennes with the aim of reaching [[Antwerp]] while encircling the Allied armies in the area.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=765–766}} The offensive began with an artillery barrage shortly before dawn on 16 December. Spearheading the attack were two panzer armies composed largely of Waffen-SS divisions.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=465}} The battle groups found advancing through the forests and wooded hills of the Ardennes difficult in the winter weather, but they initially made good progress in the northern sector. They soon encountered strong resistance from the US [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd]] and [[99th Infantry Division (United States)|99th Infantry Divisions]]. By 23 December, the weather improved enough for Allied air forces to attack the German forces and their supply columns, causing fuel shortages. In increasingly difficult conditions, the German advance slowed and was stopped.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|pp=767–769}} Hitler's failed offensive cost 700 tanks and most of their remaining mobile forces in the west,{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=769}} as well as most of their irreplaceable reserves of manpower and materiel.{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=232}}

During the battle, SS-''Obersturmbannführer'' [[Joachim Peiper]] left a path of destruction, which included Waffen-SS soldiers under his command murdering American [[POW]]s and unarmed Belgian civilians in the [[Malmedy massacre]].{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=468}} Captured SS soldiers who were part of ''Kampfgruppe Peiper'' were tried during the [[Malmedy massacre trial]] following the war for this massacre and several others in the area. Many of the perpetrators were sentenced to hang, but the sentences were commuted. Peiper was imprisoned for eleven years for his role in the killings.{{sfn|Parker|2012|p=278}}

In the east, the Red Army resumed their offensive on 12 January 1945. German forces were outnumbered twenty to one in aircraft, eleven to one in infantry, and seven to one in tanks on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Kershaw|2011|p=168}} By the end of the month, the Red Army had made bridgeheads across the [[Oder]], the last geographic obstacle before Berlin.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=70}} The western Allies continued to advance as well, but not as rapidly as the Red Army.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=83}} The Panzer Corps conducted a successful defensive operation on 17–24 February at the [[Hron]] River, stalling the Allied advance towards Vienna.{{sfn|Duffy|2002|p=293}} The [[I SS Panzer Corps|1st]] and [[II SS Panzer Corps|2nd SS Panzer Corps]] made their way towards Austria, but were slowed by damaged railways.{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=439}}

Budapest fell on 13 February.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=82}} Hitler ordered Dietrich's [[6th SS Panzer Army]] to move into Hungary to protect the [[Nagykanizsa]] oilfields and refineries, which he deemed the most strategically valuable fuel reserves on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Seaton|1971|p=537}}{{sfn|Duffy|2002|p=293}} ''Frühlingserwachsen'' ([[Operation Spring Awakening]]), the final German offensive in the east, took place in early March. German forces attacked near Lake Balaton, with 6th SS Panzer Army advancing north towards Budapest and 2nd Panzer Army moving east and south.{{sfn|Duffy|2002|p=294}} Dietrich's forces at first made good progress, but as they drew near the Danube, the combination of muddy terrain and strong Soviet resistance brought them to a halt.{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=238}} By 16 March the battle was lost.{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=450}} Enraged by the defeat, Hitler ordered the Waffen-SS units involved to remove their [[cuff title]]s as a mark of disgrace. Dietrich refused to carry out the order.{{sfn|Messenger|2001|pp=167–168}}

By this time, on both the Eastern and Western Front, the activities of the SS were becoming clear to the Allies, as the concentration and extermination camps were being overrun.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=542–548}} Allied troops were filled with disbelief and repugnance at the evidence of Nazi brutality in the camps.{{sfn|Fritz|2004|pp=50–55}}

==SS units and branches==

===Reich Main Security Office===
Heydrich held the title of ''Chef der Sicherheitspolizei und SD'' (Chief of the Security Police and SD) until 27 September 1939, when he became chief of the newly established [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=470}}{{sfn|Headland|1992|p=22}} From that point forward, the RSHA was in charge of SS security services. It had under its command the SD, Kripo, and Gestapo, as well as several offices to handle finance, administration, and supply.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=470}} [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]], who had been chief of operations for the Gestapo, was appointed Gestapo chief at this time.{{sfn|Weale|2010|page=131}} [[Arthur Nebe]] was chief of the Kripo, and the two branches of SD were commanded by a series of SS officers, including [[Otto Ohlendorf]] and [[Walter Schellenberg]]. The SD was considered an elite branch of the SS, and its members were better educated and typically more ambitious than those within the ranks of the ''Allgemeine'' SS.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=21}} Members of the SD were specially trained in criminology, intelligence, and counter-intelligence. They also gained a reputation for ruthlessness and unwavering commitment to Nazi ideology.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=21–22}}

Heydrich was attacked in Prague on 27 May 1942 by a British-trained team of Czech and Slovak soldiers who had been sent by the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] to kill him in [[Operation Anthropoid]]. He died from his injuries a week later.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|pp=494–495}}{{efn|In an act of reprisal, upwards of 10,000 Czechs were arrested; 1,300 were shot, including all male inhabitants from the nearby town of [[Lidice]] (where Heydrich's assassins had supposedly been harbored), and the town was razed.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|pp=495–496}} }} Himmler ran the RSHA personally until 30 January 1943, when Heydrich's positions were taken over by [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]].{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=661}}

===&lt;span id="Special_action_units"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ''SS-Sonderkommandos''===
Beginning in 1938 and throughout World War II, the SS enacted a procedure where offices and units of the SS could form smaller sub-units, known as ''SS-Sonderkommandos'', to carry out special tasks, including large-scale murder operations. The use of ''SS-Sonderkommandos'' was widespread. According to former ''SS [[Sturmbannführer]]'' [[Wilhelm Höttl]], not even the SS leadership knew how many ''SS-Sonderkommandos'' were constantly being formed, disbanded, and reformed for various tasks, especially on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Diner|2006|p=123}}

An ''SS-Sonderkommando'' unit led by ''SS-Sturmbannführer'' [[Herbert Lange]] murdered 1,201 psychiatric patients at the [[Tiegenhof]] psychiatric hospital in the [[Free City of Danzig]],{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=228}} 1,100 patients in [[Owińska]], 2,750 patients at [[Kościan]], and 1,558 patients at [[Działdowo]], as well as hundreds of Poles at [[Fort VII]], where the mobile gas van and gassing bunker were developed.{{sfn|Montague|2012|pp=188–190}}{{sfn|Friedlander|1997|p=138}} In 1941–42, ''SS-Sonderkommando Lange'' set up and managed the first extermination camp, at [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]], where 152,000 Jews were killed using gas vans.{{sfn|Stackelberg|2007|p=220}}

After the [[battle of Stalingrad]] in February 1943, Himmler realised that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of [[Sonderaktion 1005|''Sonderkommando'' 1005]], a special task force under SS-''[[Standartenführer]]'' [[Paul Blobel]]. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves on the Eastern Front to exhume bodies and burn them in an attempt to cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished at the end of the war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|pp=258–260, 262}}

The ''Eichmann Sonderkommando'' was a task force headed by [[Adolf Eichmann]] that arrived in Budapest on 19 March 1944, the same day that [[Operation Margarethe|Axis forces invaded Hungary]]. Their task was to take a direct role in the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. The ''SS-Sonderkommandos'' enlisted the aide of [[antisemitic]] elements from the Hungarian gendarmerie and pro-German administrators from within the Hungarian Interior Ministry.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=195}} Round-ups began on 16 April, and from 14 May, four trains of 3,000 Jews per day left Hungary and travelled to the camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, arriving along a newly built spur line that terminated a few hundred metres from the gas chambers.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=408}}{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=168, 172}} Between 10 and 25 percent of the people on each train were chosen as forced laborers; the rest were killed within hours of arrival.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=408}}{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=173}} Under international pressure, the Hungarian government halted deportations on 6 July 1944, by which time over 437,000 of Hungary's 725,000 Jews had died.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=408}}{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=160, 183}}

===''Einsatzgruppen''===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-A0706-0018-030, Ukraine, ermordete Familie.jpg|thumb|SS killings in [[Zboriv]], 1941. A teenage boy is brought to view his dead family before being shot himself.]]

The ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' had its origins in the ad hoc ''Einsatzkommando'' formed by Heydrich following the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in Austria in March 1938.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=436}} Two units of ''Einsatzgruppen'' were stationed in the [[Sudetenland]] in October 1938. When military action turned out not to be necessary because of the [[Munich Agreement]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=436}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=405, 412}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' also followed Wehrmacht troops and killed potential partisans.{{sfn|Stackelberg|2007|p=161}} Similar groups were used in 1939 for the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupation of Czechoslovakia]].{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=109}}

Hitler felt that the planned extermination of the Jews was too difficult and important to be entrusted to the military.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=102}} In 1941 the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were sent into the Soviet Union to begin large-scale genocide of Jews, [[Romani people]], and communists.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=15–16}} Historian [[Raul Hilberg]] estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and related agencies killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=257}} The largest mass shooting perpetrated by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' was at [[Babi Yar]] outside [[Kiev]], where 33,771 Jews were killed in a single operation on 29–30 September 1941.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=120–123}} In the [[Rumbula massacre]] (November–December 1941), 25,000 victims from the [[Riga ghetto]] were killed.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|pp=210–214}} Another mass shooting early in 1942 claimed the lives of over 10,000 Jews in [[Kharkov]].{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1991|p=228}}

The last ''Einsatzgruppen'' were disbanded in mid-1944 (although some continued to exist on paper until 1945) due to the German retreat on both fronts and the consequent inability to continue extermination activities. Former ''Einsatzgruppen'' members were either assigned duties in the Waffen-SS or concentration camps. Twenty-four ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders were tried for war crimes following the war.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=274}}

===SS Court Main Office===
The [[SS Court Main Office]] (''Hauptamt SS-Gericht'') was an internal legal system for conducting investigations, trials, and punishment of the SS and police. It had more than 600 lawyers on staff in the main offices in Berlin and Munich. Proceedings were conducted at 38 regional SS courts throughout Germany. It was the only authority authorized to try SS personnel, except for SS members who were on active duty in the Wehrmacht (in such cases, the SS member in question was tried by a standard military tribunal). Its creation placed the SS beyond the reach of civilian legal authority. Himmler personally intervened as he saw fit regarding convictions and punishment.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=37, 40, 41}} The historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] describes this court system as one factor in the creation of the Nazi totalitarian police state, as it removed objective legal procedures, rendering citizens defenseless against the "summary justice of the SS terror."{{sfn|Bracher|1970|p=214}}

===SS Cavalry===
Shortly after Hitler seized power in 1933, most horse riding associations were taken over by the SA and SS.{{sfn|Krüger|Wedemeyer-Kolwe|2009|p=34}} Members received combat training to serve in the ''Reiter-SS'' (SS Cavalry Corps).{{sfn|Krüger|Wedemeyer-Kolwe|2009|p=35}} The first SS cavalry regiment, designated ''SS-Totenkopf Reitstandarte 1'', was formed in September 1939. Commanded by then SS-''Standartenführer'' [[Hermann Fegelein]], the unit was assigned to Poland, where they took part in the extermination of Polish intelligentsia.{{sfn|McNab|2013|pp=224–225}}{{sfn|Pieper|2015|p=38}} Additional squadrons were added in May 1940, for a total of fourteen.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=225}}

The unit was split into two regiments in December 1939, with Fegelein in charge of both. By March 1941 their strength was 3,500 men.{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=308}}{{sfn|Pieper|2015|pp=52–53}} In July 1941, they were assigned to the [[Pripyat swamps (punitive operation)|Pripyat swamps punitive operation]], tasked with rounding up and exterminating Jews and partisans.{{sfn|Pieper|2015|pp=81–90}} The two regiments were amalgamated into the [[SS Cavalry Brigade]] on 31 July, twelve days after the operation started.{{sfn|Pieper|2015|pp=81–82}} Fegelein's final report, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, and 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken.{{sfn|Pieper|2015|pp=119–120}}{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=310}} The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.{{sfn|Pieper|2015|p=120}} The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses in November 1941 in the [[Battle of Moscow]], with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons.{{sfn|Pieper|2015|pp=146–147}} Fegelein was appointed as commander of the [[8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer|8th SS Cavalry Division ''Florian Geyer'']] on 20 April 1943. This unit saw service in the Soviet Union in attacks on partisans and civilians.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=182}}{{sfn|Stockert|1997|p=229}} In addition, SS Cavalry regiments served in Croatia and Hungary.{{sfn|McNab|2013|pp=225–230}}

===SS Medical Corps===

{{main article|SS Medical Corps}}

The SS Medical Corps were initially known as the ''Sanitätsstaffel'' (sanitary units). After 1931, the SS formed the headquarters office ''Amt''&amp;nbsp;V as the central office for SS medical units. An SS medical academy was established in Berlin in 1938 to train Waffen-SS physicians.{{sfn|Proctor|1988|p=86}} SS medical personnel did not often provide actual medical care; their primary responsibility was medicalized genocide.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=147}} At Auschwitz, about three-quarters of new arrivals, including almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit were killed within hours of arrival.{{sfn|Levy|2006|pp=235–237}} In their role as ''Desinfektoren'' (disinfectors), SS doctors also made selections among existing prisoners as to their fitness to work, and supervised the killing of those deemed unfit. Inmates in deteriorating health were examined by SS doctors, who decided whether or not they would be able to recover in less than two weeks. Those too ill or injured to recover in that time frame were killed.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=148–149}}

At Auschwitz, the actual delivery of gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor.{{sfn|Piper|1994|p=170}}{{sfn|Lifton|Hackett|1994|p=304}} Many of the SS doctors also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners.{{sfn|Yahil|1990|p=368}} The most infamous SS doctor, [[Josef Mengele]], served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of [[Eduard Wirths]] of the camp's medical corps.{{sfn|Yahil|1990|p=369}} Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned to do so in the hope of finding subjects for his experiments.{{sfn|Levy|2006|pp=248–249}} He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins.{{sfn|Posner|Ware|1986|p=29}} In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune.{{sfn|Posner|Ware|1986|p=27}}{{sfn|Lifton|1985}} After the war, many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|pp=294–296}}

===Other SS units===

====''Ahnenerbe''====
The ''[[Ahnenerbe]]'' (Ancestral Heritage Organization) was founded in 1935 by Himmler, and became part of the SS in 1939.{{sfn|Spielvogel|1992|p=108}} It was an umbrella agency for more than fifty organizations tasked with studying the German racial identity and ancient Germanic traditions and language.{{sfn|Spielvogel|1992|p=108}}{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=132–133}} The agency sponsored archaeological expeditions in Germany, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Tibet, and elsewhere to search for evidence of Aryan roots, influence, and superiority.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=128–131, 139, 142}} Further planned expeditions were postponed indefinitely at the start of the war.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=141}}

====''SS-Frauenkops''====
The ''SS-Frauenkops'' was an auxiliary reporting and clerical unit,{{sfn|Lower|2013|p=108}} which included the ''SS-Helferinnenkorps'' (Women Helper Corps), made up of female volunteers. Members were assigned as administrative staff and supply personnel, and served in command positions and as guards at women's concentration camps.{{sfn|Schwarz|1997|pp=223–244}}{{sfn|Lower|2013|pp=108–109}} Like their male equivalents in the SS, females participated in atrocities against Jews, Poles, and others.{{sfn|Lower|2013|p=109}}

In 1942, Himmler set up the ''Reichsschule für SS Helferinnen'' (Reich school for SS helpers) in [[Oberehnheim]] to train women in communications so that they could free up men for combat roles. Himmler also intended to replace all female civilian employees in his service with ''SS-Helferinnen'' members, as they were selected and trained according to NSDAP ideology.{{sfn|Century|2011}}{{sfn|Rempel|1989|pp=223–224}} The school was closed on 22 November 1944 due to the Allied advance.{{sfn|Mühlenberg|2011|p=27}}

====''SS-Mannschaften''====
The ''SS-Mannschaften'' (Auxiliary-SS) were not considered regular SS members, but were conscripted from other branches of the German military, the NSDAP, SA, and the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' for service in concentration camps and extermination camps.{{sfn|Benz|Distel|Königseder|2005|p=70}}

==Foreign legions and volunteers==
{{see also|Waffen-SS foreign volunteers and conscripts}}

Beginning in 1940, Himmler opened up Waffen-SS recruiting to ethnic Germans that were not German citizens.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=160}} In March 1941, the SS Main Office established the ''Germanische Leitstelle'' (Germanic Guidance Office) to establish Waffen-SS recruiting offices in Nazi-occupied Europe.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|pp=212–213}} The majority of the resulting foreign Waffen-SS units wore a distinctive national collar patch and preceded their SS rank titles with the prefix ''Waffen'' instead of SS. Volunteers from Scandinavian countries filled the ranks of two divisions, the ''SS-Wiking'' and ''[[11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland|SS-Nordland]]''.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|pp=214–219}} Swiss German speakers joined in substantial numbers.{{sfn|Gutmann|2017|loc=Chapter 3}} Belgian Flemings joined Dutchmen to form the ''[[23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland|SS-Nederland]]'' legion,{{sfn|McNab|2013|pp=272–273}} and their Walloon compatriots joined the ''[[Walloon Legion|SS-Wallonien]]''.{{sfn|McNab|2013|pp=321–323}} By the end of 1943 about a quarter of the SS were ethnic Germans from across Europe,{{sfn|Höhne|2001|p=458}} and by June 1944, half the Waffen-SS were foreign nationals.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=306}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-036-05, Amin al Husseini bei bosnischen SS-Freiwilligen.jpg|thumb|[[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] greeting Bosniak SS volunteers before their departure to the Eastern Front, 1943]]

Additional Waffen-SS units were added from the [[Ukrainian collaborationism with the Axis powers|Ukrainians]], [[21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg|Albanians]] from [[Kosovo]], Serbians, Croatians, [[Turkic, Caucasian, Cossack, and Crimean collaborationism with the Axis powers|Turkic, Caucasians, Cossack]], and Tatars. The Ukrainians and Tatars, who had suffered persecution under [[Stalin]], were likely motivated primarily by opposition to the Soviet government rather than ideological agreement with the SS.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|pp=200–204}} The exiled Grand Mufti of Jerusalem [[Amin al-Husseini]] was made an SS-''Gruppenführer'' by Himmler in May 1943.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|p=199}} He subsequently used antisemitism and anti-Serb racism to recruit a Waffen-SS division of [[Bosnian Muslims]], the ''[[13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)|SS-Handschar]]''.{{sfn|Hale|2011|pp=264–266}} The year-long Soviet [[occupation of the Baltic states]] at the beginning of World War II resulted in volunteers for [[Latvia]]n and [[Estonia]]n Waffen-SS units. The [[Estonian Legion]] had 1,280 volunteers under training by the end of 1942.{{sfn|Bishop|2005|p=93}} Approximately 25,000 men served in the Estonian SS division, with thousands more conscripted into Police Front battalions and border guard units.{{sfn|Bishop|2005|pp=93–94}} Most of the Estonians were fighting primarily to regain their independence and as many as 15,000 of them died fighting alongside the Germans.{{sfn|Müller|2012|p=169}} In early 1944, Himmler even contacted Pohl to suggest releasing Muslim prisoners from concentration camps to supplement his SS troops.{{sfn|Motadel|2014|p=242}}

The [[Indian Legion]] was a Wehrmacht unit formed in August 1942 chiefly from disaffected Indian soldiers of the [[British Indian Army]] captured in the [[North African Campaign]]. In August 1944 it was transferred to the auspices of the Waffen-SS as the ''Indische Freiwilligen-Legion der Waffen-SS''.{{sfn|Stein|2002|p=189}} There was also a French volunteer division, ''[[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|SS-Charlemagne]]'', which was formed in 1944 mainly from the remnants of the [[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism]] and French ''Sturmbrigade''.{{sfn|McNab|2013|pp=326–330}}

==Ranks and uniforms==
{{Main article|Uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel}}
{{see also|Runic insignia of the Schutzstaffel}}

The SS established its own symbolism, rituals, customs, ranks and uniforms to set itself apart from other organizations. Before 1929, the SS wore the same brown uniform as the SA, with the addition of a black tie and a black cap with a ''[[Totenkopf]]'' (death's head) skull and bones symbol, moving to an all-black uniform in 1932.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=604}} In 1935, the SS combat formations adopted a service uniform in field grey for everyday wear. The SS also developed its own field uniforms, which included reversible smocks and helmet covers printed with [[camouflage]] patterns.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=88–92}} Uniforms were manufactured in hundreds of licensed factories, with some workers being prisoners of war performing forced labor. Many were produced in concentration camps.{{sfn|Givhan|1997}}

Hitler and the NSDAP understood the power of emblems and insignia to influence public opinion.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=64}} The stylized lightning bolt logo of the SS was chosen in 1932. The logo is a pair of runes from a set of 18 [[Armanen runes]] created by [[Guido von List]] in 1906. It is similar to the ancient [[Sowilō]] rune, which symbolizes the sun, but was renamed as "Sig" (victory) in List's iconography.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=64}} The ''Totenkopf'' symbolized the wearer's willingness to fight unto the death, and also served to frighten the enemy.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=69}}

==SS membership estimates 1925–45==
After 1933 a career in the SS became increasingly attractive to Germany's social elite, who began joining the movement in great numbers, usually motivated by political opportunism. By 1938 about one-third of the SS leadership were members of the [[upper middle class]]. The trend reversed after the first Soviet counter-offensive of 1942.{{sfn|Ziegler|2014|pp=132–134 and note 13}}

{{main article|Austrian SS}}
The term "Austrian SS" is often used to describe that portion of the SS membership from Austria, but it was never a recognized branch of the SS. In contrast to SS members from other countries, who were grouped into either the Germanic-SS or the Foreign Legions of the Waffen-SS, Austrian SS members were regular SS personnel. It was technically under the command of the SS in Germany, but often acted independently concerning Austrian affairs. The Austrian SS was founded in 1930 and by 1934 was acting as a covert force to bring about the ''[[Anschluss]]'' with Germany, which occurred in March 1938. Early Austrian SS leaders were Kaltenbrunner and [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]].{{sfn|Browder|1996|pp=205–206}} Austrian SS members served in every branch of the SS. Political scientist David Art of [[Tufts University]] notes that Austrians constituted 8 percent of the Third Reich's population and 13 percent of the SS; he states that 40 percent of the staff and 75 percent of commanders at death camps were Austrian.{{sfn|Art|2006|p=43}}

After the ''Anschluss'', the Austrian SS was folded into ''[[SS-Oberabschnitt Donau]]''. The third regiment of the ''SS-Verfügungstruppe'' (''Der Führer'') and the fourth ''Totenkopf'' regiment (''Ostmark'') were recruited in Austria shortly thereafter. On Heydrich's orders, mass arrests of potential enemies of the Reich began immediately after the ''Anschluss''.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|pp=120–121}} [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] was the first concentration camp opened in Austria following the ''Anschluss''.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=107}} Before the invasion of the Soviet Union, Mauthausen was the harshest of the camps in the Greater German Reich.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=121}}

The [[Hotel Metropole, Vienna|Hotel Metropole]] was transformed into Gestapo headquarters in Vienna in April 1938. With a staff of 900 (80 percent of whom were recruited from the Austrian police), it was the largest Gestapo office outside Berlin. An estimated 50,000 people were interrogated or tortured there.{{sfn|Anderson|2011}} The Gestapo in Vienna was headed by [[Franz Josef Huber]], who also served as chief of the [[Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna]]. Although its de facto leaders were [[Adolf Eichmann]] and later [[Alois Brunner]], Huber was nevertheless responsible for the mass deportation of Austrian Jews.{{sfn|Mang|2003|pp=1–5}}

==Post-war activity and aftermath==
[[File:Den Lotyšské legie (6).jpg|thumb|[[Latvian Legion Day]], 16 March 2008]]
Following Nazi Germany's collapse, the SS ceased to exist.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|p=580}} Numerous members of the SS, many of them still committed Nazis, remained at large in Germany and across Europe.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=739–741}} On 21 May 1945, the British captured Himmler, who was in disguise and using a false passport. At an internment camp near [[Lüneburg]], he committed suicide by biting down on a cyanide capsule.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=736}} Several other leading members of the SS fled, but some were quickly captured. Kaltenbrunner, chief of the RSHA and the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief upon Himmler's suicide, was captured and arrested in the [[Bavarian Alps]].{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=410}} He was among the 24 defendants put on trial at the [[International Military Tribunal]] in 1945–46.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|pp=803–804}}

Some SS members were subject to summary execution, torture, and beatings at the hands of freed prisoners, displaced persons, or Allied soldiers.{{sfn|MacDonogh|2009|p=3}}{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|pp=565–568}} American soldiers of the 157th Regiment, who entered the concentration camp at Dachau in April 1945 and saw the human deprivation and cruelty committed by the SS, [[Dachau liberation reprisals|shot some of the remaining SS camp guards]].{{sfn|Lowe|2012|pp=83–84}} On 15 April 1945, British troops entered Bergen-Belsen. They placed the SS guards on starvation rations, made them work without breaks, forced them to deal with the remaining corpses, and stabbed them with bayonets or struck them with their rifle butts if they slowed their pace.{{sfn|Lowe|2012|pp=84–87}} Some members of the [[US Army Counter Intelligence Corps]] delivered captured SS camp guards to displaced persons camps, where they knew they would be subject to summary execution.{{sfn|Brzezinski|2005}}

===International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg===
{{main article|Nuremberg trials}}
[[File:Dead ernstkaltenbrunner.jpg|thumb|Ernst Kaltenbrunner after execution by hanging on 16 October 1946]]

The Allies commenced legal proceedings against captured Nazis, establishing the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=741}} The first [[war crimes]] trial of 24 prominent figures such as [[Hermann Göring]], [[Albert Speer]], [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], [[Hans Frank]], and Kaltenbrunner took place beginning in November 1945. They were accused of four counts: conspiracy, waging a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in violation of international law.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=741}} Twelve received the death penalty, including Kaltenbrunner, who was convicted of crimes against humanity and executed on 16 October 1946.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=741–742}} The former commandant at Auschwitz, [[Rudolf Höss]], who testified on behalf of Kaltenbrunner and others, was tried and executed in 1947.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=743}}

Additional SS trials and convictions followed.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=804}} Many defendants attempted to exculpate themselves using the excuse that they were merely following [[superior orders]], which they had to obey unconditionally as part of their sworn oath and duty. The courts did not find this to be a legitimate defense.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=240–241}} A trial of 40 SS officers and guards from Auschwitz took place in Kraków in November 1947. Most were found guilty, and 23 received the death penalty.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=743–744}} In addition to those tried by the Western allies, an estimated 37,000 members of the SS were tried and convicted in Soviet courts. Sentences included hangings and long terms of hard labor.{{sfn|Burleigh|2010|p=549}} [[Piotr Cywiński]], the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, estimates that of the 70,000 members of the SS involved in crimes in concentration camps, only about 1,650 to 1,700 were tried after the war.{{sfn|Bosacki|Uhlig|Wróblewski|2008}} The International Military Tribunal declared the SS a criminal organization in 1946.{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1991|p=906}}

===Escapes===
[[File:WP Eichmann Passport.jpg|thumb|upright|[[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] passport under the name of "Ricardo Klement" that [[Adolf Eichmann]] used to enter Argentina in 1950]]

After the war, many former Nazis fled to South America, especially to Argentina, where they were welcomed by [[Juan Perón]]'s regime.{{sfn|Levy|2006|pp=143–144}} In the 1950s, former Dachau inmate Lothar Hermann discovered that [[Buenos Aires]] resident Ricardo Klement was in fact Adolf Eichmann, who had in 1948 obtained false identification and a landing permit for Argentina through an organization directed by Bishop [[Alois Hudal]], an Austrian cleric with Nazi sympathies then residing in Italy.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=207}} Eichmann was captured in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960 by [[Mossad]], the [[Israel]]i intelligence agency. At his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, he was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Eichmann was quoted as having stated, "I will jump into my grave laughing, because the fact that I have the death of five million Jews [or Reich enemies, as he later claimed to have said] on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction."{{sfn|Arendt|2006|p=46}} [[Franz Stangl]], the commandant of Treblinka, also escaped to South America with the assistance of Hudal's network. He was deported to Germany in 1967 and was sentenced to life in prison in 1970. He died in 1971.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=746–747}}

Mengele, worried that his capture would mean a death sentence, fled Germany on 17 April 1949.{{sfn|Levy|2006|p=263}} Assisted by a network of former SS members, he traveled to [[Genoa]], where he obtained a passport under the alias "Helmut Gregor" from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. He sailed to Argentina in July.{{sfn|Levy|2006|pp=264–265}} Aware that he was still a wanted man, he moved to Paraguay in 1958 and Brazil in 1960. In both instances he was assisted by former [[Luftwaffe]] pilot [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]].{{sfn|Levy|2006|pp=269, 273}} Mengele suffered a stroke while swimming and drowned in 1979.{{sfn|Levy|2006|pp=294–295}}

Thousands of Nazis, including former SS members such as Trawniki guard [[Jakob Reimer]] and Circassian collaborator [[Tscherim Soobzokov]], fled to the United States under the guise of refugees, sometimes using forged documents.{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|pp=2–3, 10–11}} Other SS men, such as Soobzokov, SD officer [[Wilhelm Höttl]], Eichmann aide [[Otto von Bolschwing]], and accused war criminal Theodor Saevecke, were employed by American intelligence agencies against the Soviets. As CIA officer Harry Rositzke noted, "It was a visceral business of using any bastard so long as he was anti-Communist&amp;nbsp;... The eagerness or desire to enlist collaborators means that sure, you didn't look at their credentials too closely."{{sfn|Lichtblau|2014|pp=29–30, 32–37, 67–68}} Similarly, the Soviets used SS personnel after the war; Operation Theo, for instance, disseminated "subversive rumours" in Allied-occupied Germany.{{sfn|Biddiscombe|2000|pp=131–143}}

[[Simon Wiesenthal]] and others have speculated about the existence of a Nazi fugitive network code-named [[ODESSA]] (an acronym for ''Organisation der ehemaligen SS-Angehörigen'', Organization of former SS members) that allegedly helped war criminals find refuge in [[Latin America]].{{sfn|Segev|2010|pp=106–108}} British writer [[Gitta Sereny]], who conducted interviews with SS men, considers the story untrue and attributes the escapes to postwar chaos and Hudal's Vatican-based network. While the existence of ODESSA remains unproven, Sereny notes that "there certainly were various kinds of Nazi aid organizations after the war — it would have been astonishing if there hadn't been."{{sfn|Sereny|1974|p=274}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4867">'''The Six Point Group''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[feminism|feminist]] campaign group founded by [[Margaret Mackworth, 2nd Viscountess Rhondda|Lady Rhondda]] in 1921 to press for changes in the law of the United Kingdom in six areas.

==Aims==
The six original specific aims were: 
# Satisfactory legislation on child assault; 
# Satisfactory legislation for the widowed mother; 
# Satisfactory legislation for the unmarried mother and her child; 
# Equal rights of guardianship for married parents; 
# Equal pay for teachers 
# Equal opportunities for men and women in the civil service.

These later evolved into six general points of equality for women: political, occupational, moral, social, economic and legal. 

==History==
The group was founded by [[Margaret Mackworth, 2nd Viscountess Rhondda|Lady Rhondda]] in 1921 to press for changes in the law of the United Kingdom in six areas. The secretary from 1921 to 1926 was the ex-suffragette Winifred Mayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WmayoW.htm|title=Winifred Mayo|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, it was active in trying to have the [[League of Nations]] pass an Equal Rights Treaty.

The group campaigned on principles of strict equality between men and women. This 'old feminism' or 'equality feminism' was sometimes contrasted to the 'new feminism' or 'welfare feminism' of other women's groups of the period, such as the [[National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship]], which sought protectionist legislation applying only to women.&lt;ref name=DBWO&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Gordon|first2=David|last2=Doughan|title=Dictionary of British Women's Organisations, 1825-1960|date=2001|publisher=Woburn Press|location=London &amp; Portland, Or.|ISBN=0-7130-0223-9|contribution=Six Point Group|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members included former militant suffragists - such as [[Dorothy E. Evans]], [[Monica Whately]] or [[Helen Archdale]] - as well as younger women like [[Winifred Holtby]] or [[Vera Brittain]]. Though the membership was usually under 300, the Six Point Group wielded considerable political influence in the interwar years and during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=DBWO/&gt; It campaigned by traditional constitutional methods. Much of its work was done through its journal, ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]''. It also made deputations to the appropriate government ministers, organised public rallies and wrote letters to major newspapers.

From 1933, along with the [[Open Door Council]], it spearheaded the movement for the right of married women to work. 

It was responsible for establishing the [[Income Tax Reform Council]] and in 1938, the [[Married Women's Association]]. 

During the [[Second World War]], the Six Point Group campaigned on a variety of issues. They protested about the fact that female volunteers in the Civil Defence Services received only two-thirds the men's pay. They objected that the compensation provided for by the Personal Injuries (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1939 was skewed between male / female recipients. They were closely involved in the Equal Compensation Campaign from 1941 to 1943 and subsequently had representatives alongside the Open Door Council and the [[Fawcett Society]] on the committee of the Equal Pay Campaign from 1944 to ensure equal pay in the Civil Service. 

The group continued to have significant political influence in the post war period. It took  part in the protests to have the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act changed to give married women more financial protection. 

From 1967, the group played an active part in the co-ordination of other women's groups on a number of issues. Its secretary in the 1970s was [[Hazel Hunkins Hallinan]].&lt;ref name=DBWO/&gt; From the late 1970s the group declined through its failure to recruit younger women. It went into abeyance in 1980, and was finally dissolved in 1983.

'''''Srbija do Tokija''''', ({{lang-sr-cyrl|Србија до Токија}}), meaning "[[Serbia]] to [[Tokyo]]", is a [[slogan]] and [[catch-phrase]] dating back to the early 1990s. In 1991, [[Serbia]]n (then-[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]) football club [[Red Star Belgrade]] won the [[1990–91 European Cup|European Cup]] and the worldwide title in [[Tokyo]], Japan, winning the [[1991 Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]]. This was the greatest success of any football club ever in [[Yugoslavia]], and was much envied by the other nations at the time of increased ethnic tensions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} The phrase has been used by Serbian football [[Fan (person)|fans]] to taunt fans from rival ethnic groups in the beginning of the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the 1990s.

==Origin of the phrase==
On May 29, 1991, as inter-ethnic relations in Yugoslavia were growing tenser, Red Star defeated [[France|French]] team [[Olympique de Marseille]] to win the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] – the first Yugoslav team to do so. As the winners of the European Cup, Red Star Belgrade earned a place in the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]], which was held at the [[National Stadium (Tokyo)|Tokyo National Stadium]]. Exultant fans coined the phrase to glorify their team's upcoming adventure.

On December 8, Red Star won the Intercontinental Cup, defeating [[Chile]]an team [[Colo-Colo]]. By that time, the tension that had underlain the  European Cup match had ignited into the Yugoslav Wars, with a short-lived [[Slovenian War|war in Slovenia]], and a full-scale [[Croatian War of Independence|war in Croatia]]. In this context, the phrase's associations with Serbian victory made it particularly appealing to nationalists and militarists.

==Occurrences==

[[Graffiti]] containing the message in [[Vojvodina]], [[Central Serbia]], as well as in [[Republika Srpska]] and other parts of [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]].&lt;ref name="hhrf-2005"&gt;[http://www.hhrf.org/hhrf/en/vojvodinareport-mar-2005.htm Anti-Minority Incidents Continue in Vojvodina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201075031/http://www.hhrf.org/hhrf/en/vojvodinareport-mar-2005.htm |date=2008-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="republika-2008"&gt;[http://www.republika.co.rs/420-421/14.html Niš's Graffiti of Hate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="manje_od_nista"&gt;[http://users.skynet.be/orbus/zbornik/manje_od_nista.htm Less than Nothing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201113829/http://users.skynet.be/orbus/zbornik/manje_od_nista.htm |date=2008-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such graffiti was also seen in [[Kosovo]] during the [[Kosovo War]].&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E2DE1138F936A25755C0A96F958260 In Ruined Village, a Mother Lives With Her Son's Blood]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Kosovo village of [[Lozica]], the local Albanian population was claiming that the graffiti "Srbije do Tokija" was written by Serbian military forces during the destruction of the village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goljp.hr/hrpublikacije7.htm Na Kosovu ništa novo]&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], phrase was expanded. "Srbija do Tokija, al' preko Milvokija", meaning "Serbia to Tokyo, but over [[Milwaukee]]", in order to show disagreement with [[United States|USA]]'s role during 1999 bombing. After the bombardment ended, phrase extension was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.rs/Intervju/Srbija-do-Tokija-al-preko-Milvokija.html Srbija do Tokija al preko Milvokija]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kragujevac]] during the night of 5/6 January 2001, unknown attackers have destroyed a shop owned by a Chinese citizen and added a slogan on the building walls &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/pubs/archive/data/200101/10111-003-pubs-beo.htm Srbija do Tokija]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2014}}

Outside of Serbia in ex-Yugoslavia, the slogan is sometimes written on walls, but then it is taken as a derogatory joke and nationalistic provocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24sata.hr/news/clanak/sarvas-na-red-voznje-napisali-srbija-do-tokija/52458/ Sarvaš:Na redu vožnje napisali "Srbija do Tokija"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''standing proxy''' is one that exists until revoked. This is in contrast to a [[Proxy voting|proxy]] that is designated for a temporary or one-time use. A special proxy takes priority over a standing proxy, and the standing proxy is temporarily suspended when the principal or his special proxy are present. As [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) Info notes:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/ds498.37r.d.htm SEC Info - Global Sources Ltd/Bermuda - 6-K - For 5/1/02 - EX-1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20356">The '''tax horsepower''' or taxable horsepower was an early system by which taxation rates for [[automobile]]s were reckoned in some European countries, such as Britain, Belgium, Germany,  France, and Italy; some US states like [[Illinois]] charged [[license plate]] purchase and renewal fees for passenger automobiles based on taxable horsepower. The tax [[horsepower]] rating was computed not from actual engine power but by a simple mathematical formula based on cylinder dimensions. At the beginning of the twentieth century, tax power was reasonably close to real power; as the internal combustion engine developed, real power became larger than nominal taxable power by a factor of ten or more.

==Britain==
The so-called [[horsepower#RAC horsepower (taxable horsepower)|RAC horsepower]] rating was devised in 1910 by the [[RAC plc|RAC]] at the invitation of the British government.&lt;ref name=MilestonesSpring1968&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = Dennis May| title = The Horse-power story| journal = Milestones, the journal of the [[Institute of Advanced Motorists|IAM]]| volume = 23rd year of publication| pages =20–22 |date = Spring 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula is:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{D \times D \times n}{2.5}&lt;/math&gt;

: where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter (or bore) of the cylinder in inches and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of cylinders&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.designchambers.com/wolfhound/wolfhoundRACHP.htm
|title=The RAC HP (horsepower) Rating - Was there any technical basis?
|author=Richard Hodgson
|publisher=wolfhound.org.uk
|accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula was calculated from total piston surface area (i.e., "bore" only). The factor of 2.5 accounts for characteristics that were widely seen in engines at the time, such as a [[mean effective pressure]] in the cylinder of 90psi (6.2 bar) and a maximum [[Mean piston speed|piston speed]] of 1000 feet per minute (5 metres per second).

The system introduced a somewhat [[Progressive tax|progressive]] way of taxing higher-value cars more than low-cost ones but was also introduced to protect the domestic British motor industry from foreign imports, especially the [[Ford Model T]]. [[Henry Ford|Henry Ford's]] mass production methods meant that the Model T was competitively priced with British-built cars despite being a much larger, more durable and more powerful car than any similarly-priced model. In 1912 Ford opened [[Ford Trafford Park Factory|a factory]] to build Model Ts in [[Manchester]], to circumvent the import tariffs that, up to that point, had increased the effective price of foreign cars. Under the RAC's formula the Model T was now a 22 'tax horsepower' car, making it much more expensive to run than its British-built rivals on sale for the same price.

 At first the RAC rating was usually representative of the car's actual (brake) horsepower, but as engine design and technology progressed in the 1920s and 1930s these two figures began to drift apart, with an engine making much more power than its RAC rating (and the car's model name) suggested: by 1924 the Austin Seven's 747cc engine produced 10.5 brake horsepower, 50% more than its official rating. [[File:1912 Wolseley 16-20hp Landaulette 8312296035.jpg|thumb|1912 Wolseley 16-20 see also 1913 [[Vauxhall 30-98]] and many others]]

It was common for the name of a model to include both its RAC tax horsepower and its actual power output, such as the [[Wolseley 14/60]] and the [[Alvis 12/70]] of 1938 - note that the Alvis's engine makes more brake horsepower than the Wolseley but makes less power under the RAC system and thus would be taxed less. By 1948 the Standard Flying Twelve, a typical mid-size saloon, produced 44&amp;nbsp;bhp from a 1.6-litre engine or nearly four times as much horsepower as the RAC system suggested, even though manufacturers were still restricted to making slow-revving engines with narrow bores and long strokes to keep abreast of the tax structure.

To minimise tax ratings British designers developed engines of a given swept volume (capacity) with very long stroke and low piston surface area. Another effect was the multiplicity of models: Sevens, Eights, Nines, Tens, Elevens, Twelves, Fourteens, Sixteens etc. each to fit with a taxation class.&lt;ref name=TT50378&gt;Motor-Car Taxation. Effects of Different Methods on Design. Models for Home Use and Export. ''The Times'', Saturday, Feb 16, 1946; pg. 5; Issue 50378&lt;/ref&gt; Larger more lightly stressed engines may have been equally economical to run and, in less variety, produced much more economically.&lt;ref name=TT50378/&gt;

The system discouraged manufacturers from switching to more fuel-efficient [[Overhead valve engine|overhead valve]] engines as these generally required larger bores, while the established [[Flathead engine|sidevalve]] layout could easily use very narrow bores. Despite OHV engines having significant benefits in economy, refinement and performance the RAC system often made these engines more expensive to run because it placed them in a higher tax class than sidevalve engines of identical power output{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

British cars and cars in other countries applying the same approach to automobile taxation continued to feature long thin cylinders even in the 1950s and 1960s, after taxation had ceased to be based on piston diameters, partly because limited funds meant that investment in new models often involved new bodies while under the hood/bonnet engines lurked from earlier decades with only minor upgrades such as (typically) higher compression ratios as higher octane fuels slowly returned to European service stations.

The emphasis on long strokes, combined with the nature of British roads in the pre-[[Controlled-access highway|motorway]] era, meant that British engines tended to deliver strong low- and mid-range [[torque]] for their size but have low maximum speeds. The long stroke also meant that piston speeds and the load on the [[Crankpin#Big end bearings|big end bearings]] became excessive at higher cruising speeds. Many smaller British cars did not cope well with sustained cruising at 60&amp;nbsp;mph or more, which led to reliability problems when the vehicles were exported to other markets, especially the [[United States of America|United States]]. Cars such as the [[Austin A40 Devon|Austin A40]], the [[Morris Minor]] and the [[Hillman Minx]] all achieved notable sales in the USA in the late 1940s (after the RAC horsepower formula had been withdrawn but when car designs were still influenced by it) until the short service life of the engines when asked to routinely drive long distances at freeway speeds became clear. Other imports, notably the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], which originated in countries with different fiscal horsepower rules and existing high speed road networks, proved more reliable and achieved much greater success.

The distortive effects on engine design were seen to reduce the saleability of British vehicles in export markets.&lt;ref name=TT50378/&gt; While the system had protected the home market from the import of large-engined low-priced (because produced in such high volumes) American vehicles the need for roomy generously proportioned cars for export was now paramount&lt;ref name=TT50378/&gt; and the British government abandoned the tax horsepower system&lt;ref name=MilestonesSpring1968/&gt; with effect from 1 January 1947&lt;ref&gt;Change In Motor Tax On January 1. ''The Times'', Wednesday, Feb 13, 1946&lt;/ref&gt; replacing it at first with a tax on cubic capacity, which was in turn replaced by a flat tax applying from 1 January 1948.&lt;ref&gt;The New Car Tax.  ''The Times'', Wednesday, Jun 18, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

During the early twentieth century, automobiles in the United States were specified with a figure identical to RAC horsepower and computed using the same formula; this was known either as "NACC horsepower" (named for the [[National Automobile Chamber of Commerce]]), "ALAM horsepower" (for NACC's predecessor, the [[Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers]]), or "SAE horsepower" (for the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]]). (This last term should not be confused with later horsepower ratings by the SAE.) This value was sometimes used for taxation and license fee purposes.

==Continental Europe==
Although tax horsepower was computed on a similar basis in several other European countries during the two or three decades before the Second World War, continental cylinder dimensions were already quoted in millimeters, reflecting the [[Metric system|metric measurement]] system. As a result of roundings when converting the formula between the two measurement systems, a British tax horse-power unit ended up being worth 1.014 continental (i.e. French) tax horse-power units.&lt;ref name=MilestonesSpring1968/&gt;

==France==
Before [[World War II]], [[France]] was the leading European producer of powerful [[Luxury vehicle|luxury automobiles]].&lt;ref name="facel-vega.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facel-vega.com/mageng1.shtml|title=Facel Vega Home Page|first=|last=webmaster|date=|website=www.facel-vega.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brands such as [[Bugatti]], [[Delage]], [[Delahaye]], and [[Talbot-Lago]] made vehicles that are highly collectible today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mullinautomotivemuseum.com|title=Mullin Automotive Museum|author=|date=|website=www.mullinautomotivemuseum.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], the government of France decided to end this situation.&lt;ref name="AN102916"&gt;
{{cite news| url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20161029/OEM03/310319967/reliving-the-golden-era-of-french-luxury|title=Reliving the golden era of French luxury|publisher=Automotive News |page= |date=29 October 2016| accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, the [[dirigiste]] approach of the French government uses ''puissance fiscale ("power tax")'' regulations to encourage manufacturers to build cars with small engines and low horsepower (or ''CV''; for "chevaux-vapeur", lit. "steam horses"), and French motorists to buy them.&lt;ref name="facel-vega.com"/&gt;

Subsequent attempts at building powerful luxury cars, the [[Facel|Facel Vega]] in the 1950s and the [[Citroën SM]] in the 1970s, used foreign sourced engines.

French-made vehicles had very small engines relative to vehicle size by international standards. The 1948-1990 [[Citroën 2CV]] model for example was launched with a 375 [[cubic metre#Submultiples|cc]] two-cylinder engine that weighs only {{Convert|100|lb|kg}}, considered a [[Quadricycle]] in some regions. Since many export markets did not have this same constraint, the French automobile industry became less relevant as an export power.

In France, fiscal horsepower survives. It was first redefined in 1956; the formula became more complicated but now it took account of cylinder stroke as well as bore and number of cylinders (which together make [[Engine displacement|Engine Displacement]]) along with [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] to take into account the total volume the engine takes in per minute, rather than one dimension. These new rules meant there was no longer any fiscal advantage in producing engines with narrow cylinders, and as noted above, a number of reasons not to. The French government modified the fiscal horsepower formula again in 1978 and in 1998. Since 1998 the taxable power is calculated from the sum of a [[CO2 emission|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission]] figure (over 45), and the maximum power output of the engine in [[kilowatt]]s (over 40) to the [[Exponentiation|power]] of 1.6.

[[Diesel engine]]s have long been favoured by French fiscal horsepower calculations. First, since 1956, diesel engines have had a .7 coefficient applied to the calculated value, thus lowering the fiscal horsepower. Secondly, diesel powered vehicles generally produce less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than equivalent gasoline powered models, which in turn reduces the calculated fiscal horsepower using the post 1998 formulas. In 2016, [[Paris]] considered banning diesel vehicles because of serious [[smog]] incidents attributed to diesel.&lt;ref name="Quartz"&gt;
{{cite news| url=https://qz.com/851651/paris-madrid-mexico-city-and-athens-are-cutting-pollution-by-banning-diesel-cars/|title=DOWN WITH DIESEL Four of the world’s biggest cities are taking an unprecedented step to battle pollution|author=Max de Haldevang|publisher=Quartz |date=4 December 2016| accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French air quality researcher notes “The decades-long support for diesel by EU governments [is] a self-inflicted public health crisis of historic proportions."   &lt;ref name="Quartz"/&gt;

==Germany==
Tax horse-power (Steuer-PS) was introduced in Germany on 3 June 1906 however in contrast to many regions, i.e. British and French tax horsepower formulae above, it was calculated based on the overall [[engine displacement]] from its implementation.

The German formula applied a higher tax horse-power factor to [[two stroke engine]] cars than to four stroke engined cars based on the fact each cylinder in a two stroke engine fires (has a [[power stroke (engine)|power stroke]]) every revolution where an [[otto cycle]] or 4 stroke cylinder only fires every second revolution .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oswald |first=Werner |title=Deutsche Autos 1920-1945, volume 2 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |language=German |year=2001 |isbn=3-613-02170-6 |page=532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula for tax horsepower was as follows:

: Units of tax horse-power (Steuer-PS) for four-stroke engined cars = 0.30·i·d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s

: Units of tax horse-power (Steuer-PS) for two-stroke engined cars = 0.45·i·d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s

In these formulae:
:::  i = the number of cylinders
:::  d = the diameter (or bore) of each cylinder
:::  s = the stroke length of each cylinder

Incomplete fractions were rounded up to the nearest whole number so a four stroke engined car of 1,000cc would end up designated as a 4PS (or four horsepower) car for car tax purposes.

After April 1928, recognizing the logic of the linear relationship between tax horsepower and engine capacity, the authorities simply set car tax rates according to engine size for passenger cars.   (For commercial vehicles vehicle tax became a function of vehicle weight.)   Attempts to correlate new tax horsepower values with old ones result in small differences due to roundings used in the new formula which are, for most purposes, unimportant.

In 1933 the Hitler government came into power and identified promotion of the auto-industry as key to economic recovery:  new cars purchased after April 1933 were no longer burdened by an annual car tax charge&lt;ref name=Spiegel201967&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46265070.html|title=AUTOMOBILE / ABSATZKRISE ...

Thereafter war and military defeat led to a change in car tax policy and after 1945 tax horse-power returned in West Germany, applying the 1928 formula, as a determinant of annual car tax on new cars purchased in or after 1945. However, the introduction of tax on road fuel in 1951 and progressive increases in fuel tax thereafter reduced the importance of annual car tax so that today far more of the tax on car ownership is collected via fuel taxes than via annual car tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oswald |first=Werner |title=Deutsche Autos 1920-1945, volume 2 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |language=German |year=2001 |isbn=3-613-02170-6 |page=533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switzerland==
The 26 cantons of Switzerland used (and use) a variety of different taxation methods. Originally, all of Switzerland used the tax horsepower, calculated as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{CV/PS}=0.4\times i\times d^2\times S&lt;/math&gt;

: where

: ''i'' is the number of cylinders,
: ''d'' is the diameter (or bore) of the cylinder in cm
: ''S'' is the piston stroke in cm&lt;ref name="AR87"&gt;{{cite book | title = Automobil Revue 1987 | editor-last = Büschi | editor-first = Hans-Ulrich | publisher = Hallwag AG | location = Berne, Switzerland | language = German, French | pages = 96–97 | volume = 82 |date=5 March 1987 | isbn = 3-444-00458-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
or {{math|1.6/&amp;pi; {{=}} 0.51}} times [[engine displacement]] in cc

The limits between the horsepower denominations were drawn at either 0.49, 0.50, or 0.51 in different cantons. Thus, the eight horsepower category would cover cars of about 7.5 - 8.5 CV. In 1973 Berne switched to a taxation system based on vehicle weight, and a few other cantons followed. In 1986 [[Ticino]] switched to a system based on a calculation including engine size and weight.&lt;ref name="AR87"/&gt; Nonetheless, the tax horsepower system remains in effect for seven cantons {{as of|2007|lc=y}}. The plethora of different taxation systems has contributed to there always being an uncommonly wide variety of different cars marketed in Switzerland.

==Spain==
Fiscal horsepower also lives on in Spain, but is defined simply in terms of overall engine capacity. It therefore encourages small engines, but does not influence the ratio of cylinder bore to stroke. The current Spanish definition does, however, add a factor that varies in order to favour four-stroke engines over two-stroke engines.

==Impact on engine design and on auto-industry development==
The fiscal benefits of reduced cylinder diameters (bore) in favor of longer cylinders (stroke) may have been a factor in encouraging the proliferation of relatively small six-cylinder-engined models appearing in Europe in the 1930s, as the market began to open up for faster middle-weight models.&lt;ref name=MilestonesSpring1968/&gt;   The system clearly perpetuated side-valve engines in countries where the taxation system encouraged these engine designs, and delayed the adoption of [[overhead valve engine]]s because the small cylinder diameter reduced the space available for overhead valves and the lengthy combustion chamber in any case reduced their potential for improving combustion efficiency.

Another effect was to make it very expensive to run cars imported from countries where there was no fiscal incentive to minimise cylinder diameters: this may have limited car imports from the USA to Europe during a period when western governments were employing naked [[protectionism|protectionist policies]] in response to economic depression, and thereby encouraged US auto-makers wishing to exploit the European auto-markets to set up their own dedicated subsidiary plants in the larger European markets.

Taxation can modify incentives and tax horsepower is no exception. Large [[engine displacement|capacity]] (displacement) engines are penalized, so engineers working where engine capacity is taxed are encouraged to minimize capacity. This rarely happened in the USA, where license plate fees, even adjusted for horsepower ratings, were comparatively much lower than European car taxes.

==Naming and classification of individual car models==
The tax horsepower rating was often used as the car model name. For example, the [[Morris Eight]] got its name from its horsepower rating of eight; not from the number of cylinders of the engine. British cars of the 1920s and 1930s were frequently named using a combination of tax horsepower and actual horsepower - for example, the [[Talbot 14-45]] had an actual power of 45&amp;nbsp;hp and a tax horsepower of only 14&amp;nbsp;hp. The [[Citroën 2CV]] (French ''deux chevaux vapeur [fiscaux]'', two tax horsepowers) was the car that kept such a name for the longest time.

'''Theodore Doughty Miller''' (September 19, 1835 – March 1, 1897) was a Baptist preacher from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the late 19th century. Before the [[US Civil War]] (1861-1865), he was a part of [[abolitionist]] society in Philadelphia, and after the war he played a leading role in the Baptist Church. In 1881 he was called "the best colored preacher ever located in Philadelphia".&lt;ref name="Cathcart1881"&gt;Cathcart, William, ed. The Baptist Encyclopædia: A Dictionary of the Doctrines, Ordinances, Usages, Confessions of Faith, Sufferings, Labors, and Successes, and of the General History of the Baptist Denomination in All Lands: with Numerous Biographical Sketches of Distinguished American and Foreign Baptists, and a Supplement. Vol. 2. LH Everts, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Theodore Doughty Miller was born September 19, 1835 in New York City. His parents were Henry and Sarah Miller. Henry died when Theodore was an infant and Sarah died when he was about sixteen. He had an older brother who went to California during the gold rush and died in the 1862 sinking of the [[SS Golden Gate]]. As a boy, he went to colored school no. 1 headed by [[John Patterson (educator)|John Patterson]]. In July, 1849 he passed the teacher's examination and became first assistant in the Public High School. As a youth he attended St. Phillips Episcopal Church. He left this church and joined the Church of the Messiah led by [[Alexander Crummell]].&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p260-266&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1849 to 1851 he studied during the evenings and Saturdays at the [[St. Augustine Institute]] and began to study all religious creeds and compare them with the bible. He was baptized into the Baptist church, but did not agree with that church's doctrine of Baptism. In 1851 he moved to [[Trenton, New Jersey]] to become principal of a public school there. Around that time he married Elizabeth P. Wood. He also helped form a young men's association and organized a choir and Sunday school of the local Mt. Zion A. M. E. church. In 1856 he left Trenton to take charge of a public school at [[Newburgh, New York]], where he finally joined the Baptist church along with his wife, both being baptized February 22, 1857 in the [[Hudson River]]. He joined the Shiloh Baptist Church where his position as a church leader was opposed by the white pastor. In spite of this, he was chosen as teacher and then superintendent of the Sunday school and made a trustee and deacon of the church. When his further advancement was opposed by the pastor, he opened his own church where he preached on Sunday afternoons and nights - although he was not licensed to preach by the Church. He attended the [[American Baptist Missionary Society]] Convention at Philadelphia in 1858&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; where he along with [[Leonard Grimes]], [[William Spellman]], and [[Sampson White]] pushed the organization to oppose slavery. They voted to have no fellowship with slave-holding ministries.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Henry H. Black Church beginnings: The long-hidden realities of the first years. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004. p120&lt;/ref&gt; He preached at the convention and he was given a recommendation that he be licensed, either at Shiloh or at the First Baptist Church, a white church which had promised to give him license. Under this pressure, Shiloh granted him a license and he began to preach.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

In 1858, he was called by the Zion Baptist Church of [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and was ordained on January 19, 1859 at the Concord Street Church in Brooklyn. That same year, he moved to [[Albany, New York]] where he preached for five years&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; at the Hamilton Street Baptist Church. In Albany, Miller supported anti-slavery efforts and served as secretary of the Irrepressible Conflict Society for Human Rights organized immediately following the execution of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in December 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, Benjamin. Allies for Freedom. Da Capo Press, 2001. p150-1953&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he studied under [[Elias Lyman Magoon]], a noted preacher in Albany. In 1864, he preached at Oak Street Baptist Church and the Pearl Street Church, both in West Philadelphia, and became pastor at the Pearl Street Branch on August 1, where he finally settled.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; The church was also known as the First Baptist Church and moved to Cherry Street when it overran capacity at the previous location.&lt;ref&gt;Africa, the Colored Population of Philadelphia, The Evening Telegraph (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) March 30, 1867, page 1-2, accessed September 19, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6696219// and https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6696227//&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership in the Baptist Church==
He held many leadership positions in the church, including corresponding secretary of the American Baptist Missionary Convention and recording secretary of the New England Baptist Missionary Convention.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; He gave the opening sermon at the Philadelphia Baptist Association in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons 1887 and Cathcart 1881 have it in 1879, Pegues 1892 has 1876.&lt;/ref&gt; He led the Sunday School at his church. He organized a church in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] and a branch of his church in [[Germantown, Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; He also received a [[Doctor of Divinity]].&lt;ref name="Pegues1892"&gt;Pegues, Albert Witherspoon. Our Baptist Ministers and Schools. Willey &amp; Company, 1892. p345-350, accessed September 19, 2016 at https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=emu.010001059575;view=1up;seq=352&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, Miller was elected moderator of the Philadelphia Baptist Association convention,&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Jr, W. Glenn, ed. The Baptist river: essays on many tributaries of a diverse tradition.
