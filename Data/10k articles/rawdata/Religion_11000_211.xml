      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3268">An '''adjurist''' (from the Latin word "adjure", meaning to swear or to exorcise) is a follower of religious teachings that, per the Catholic Encyclopedia, are defined as "an urgent demand made upon another to do something, or to desist from doing something, which demand is rendered more solemn and more irresistible by coupling with it the name of God or of some sacred person or thing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01142c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Adjuration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
There are few references to adjurists in modern literatures, though obscure mentions of the group can be found in [[theology|theological]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] writings.  

A recent announcement that appeared in a variety of media outlets worldwide on December 29, 2007 hailed the formation of adjuristine-exorcism squads by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=504969 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Pope's exorcist squads will wage war on Satan | date=December 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams were reportedly being dispatched to "tackle the rise of Satanism"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; according to the UK newspaper the Daily Mail.  The report, first made public by 82-year-old Father [[Gabriele Amorth]], the Vatican "exorcist-in-chief," to the online Catholic news service Petrus, was almost immediately dismissed by Vatican officials but the publication of the reports represented an unusual instance where the existence of adjurists was acknowledged.  

Media references to such groups continues to become mainstreams with articles appearing in the Washington Post in February, 2008 highlighted the rise of such activities noting "About 70 priests serve as trained exorcists in Poland, about double the number of five years ago. An estimated 300 exorcists are active in Italy. Foremost among them: the [[Gabriele Amorth]], 82, who performs exorcisms daily in Rome and is dean of Europe's corps of demon-battling priests." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/10/AR2008021002435_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | title=Ritual of Dealing With Demons Undergoes a Revival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular culture, the adjurist concept was used in the straight-to-video film [[The Devil's Tomb]], starring [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] and [[Ron Perlman]].  In the movie, [[Henry Rollins]] plays a priest claiming to be a member of a group performing exorcisms and ingesting evil spirits.

Within [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theosophical Quarterly Magazine - Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Izu_qTvKX8C&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=adjurists|isbn=978-0-7661-5285-4|author1=Blavatsky, Helene Petrovna|date=2003–2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are references to "the Adjurists, Exorcists, Conjurerists, and Intercessors" in relation to [[Nigromancy]], or the practice of the black arts.  Ascribing evil intent to adjurists is common in older texts, though some believe their actions to be misunderstood and actually noble."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2065">'''Askajamuk II''' (died 8th-century) was the ruler of the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarezm]] from 712 to an unknown date. He was the relative and successor of [[Khusrau of Khwarezm|Khusrau]].

He was the son of king [[Azkajwar II]], who is probably identical with the Afrighid ruler Jigan or Chigan, who became a vassal of the [[Abbasids]] in 712. During the same year, an anti-Abbasid rebellion broke out in Khwarazm, which resulted in the death of Azkajwar II. Another Afrighid prince named Khusrau was shortly after put on the throne. However, the Abbasids then invaded Khwarazm and overthrew the latter and made Askajamuk II the new ruler of the kingdom. Askajamuk II was later succeeded by his son [[Sawashfan]].

'''Banishment''' or '''[[exile]]''' can be a form of [[punishment]]. It means to be away from one's home (i.e. [[city]], [[Sovereign state|state]] or [[country]]) while either being explicitly refused permission to return and/or being threatened by [[prison]] or [[Capital punishment|death]] upon return. It is a common theme within the [[Bible]], beginning with [[Adam and Eve]]. Below is a partial list of these exiles as referenced in the [[Bible]].

''(Proclamation to "blot out" "from under heaven" anyone who "turns away from the {{LORD}}".)''

{{italic title}}
In Hinduism and Sikhism, '''''Bhagats''''' ({{lang-pa|ਭਗਤ}}, from [[Sanskrit]] {{lang-hi|भक्त}}) were originally holy men of various sects. Members of a community that gives prominence to the religious teachings of [[Kabir]] are also known as ''Bhagats'', and the Hindu and Sikh religions both have numerous ''Bhagat'' communities in [[Punjab]]. These communities have faith in all the ''Bhagats'' in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], but consider Kabir to be the most important of them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Definition==
''Bhagat'' is a [[Punjabi (language)|Punjabi]] word derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Bhagavata'', which means: a devotee of the Lord (''[[Bhagavan|Bhagvan]]''). Many such [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Sikhism|Sikh]] devotees are followers of the ''[[bhakti]]'' tradition, who adhere to a prayer-led path of [[Self-realization|realization]]. ''Bhagat'' is also a Hindu and [[Jainism|Jain]] surname, most commonly in northern states of India.

==Sikhism==
[[File:Saint Kabir with Namdeva, Raidas and Pipaji. Jaipur, early 19century, National Museum New Delhi (2).jpg|thumb|Four Bhagats of Sikhism: Ravidas, Kabir, Namdev and Pipa.]]
Sikhism's central scriptural book, [[Guru Granth Sahib]], has teachings of 15 ''Bhagats'', along with ''[[Gurbani|bani]]'' of [[Sikh Gurus]], ''Bhats'' and ''Gursikhs''. Because Sikhism believes in one human creed (no one belongs to a higher or a lower social status or caste) and that accounts to adding ''Bani'' of various authors, a total of 36, in Guru Granth Sahib irrespective of many belonging to religions other than Sikhism and even some ''Bhagats'' who were considered as low, untouchables or ''[[Shudras]]'', as per the [[Varna (Hinduism)|Hindu caste system]], based on the caste they were born into. Religious writings of those ''Bhagats'' were collected by [[Guru Arjan]]. Some of them lived before [[Guru Nanak]], but came to have a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] as opposed to a [[God in Hinduism|polytheistic]] doctrine.

Broadly speaking, therefore, a ''Bhagat'' is a holy person or a member of a community whose objectives involve leading humanity towards [[God in Sikhism|God]] and highlighting injustices in the world.

{{Black Hills and Badlands}}
'''Black Elk Peak''' (formerly '''Harney Peak''') is the highest natural point in [[South Dakota]], United States. It lies in the [[Black Elk Wilderness]] area, in southern [[Pennington County, South Dakota|Pennington County]], in the [[Black Hills National Forest]].&lt;ref name="pb"/&gt; The peak lies {{convert|3.7|mi|abbr=on}} west-southwest of [[Mount Rushmore]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mount Rushmore, South Dakota'', 30x60 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|7242|ft|m|0}},&lt;ref name="ngs"/&gt; it has been described by the [[Board on Geographical Names]] as the highest [[Summit (topography)|summit]] in the [[United States]] east of the [[Rocky Mountains]].

Although part of the North American Cordillera (the Rocky Mountains in a broader sense) the Chisos Mountains of the Big Bend of Texas are far east of the continental divide and contain mountains higher than Black Elk peak and range from 14 to 16 (nautical) miles further east at 103°15′29″W.

It is also known as '''''Hiŋháŋ Káǧa''''' (in [[Lakota language|Lakota]]).

The [[U.S. Board on Geographic Names]], which has jurisdiction in federal lands, officially changed the mountain's name from "Harney Peak" to "Black Elk Peak" on August 11, 2016, honoring [[Black Elk]], the noted [[Lakota Sioux]] [[medicine man]] for whom the Wilderness Area is named.&lt;ref name="blackelk"/&gt;

Professional but unofficial measurements in 2016 found the highest natural rock to be at {{convert|7231.32|ft|m}} NAVD88 and the nearby secondary peak slightly lower at {{convert|7229.41|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jerry Penry |url=http://www.penryfamily.com/harneypeak/survey.html | title=Harney Peak's Elevation|accessdate=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Seth|last=Tupper|title=How South Dakota's high point ended up shorter than thought|url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/how-south-dakota-s-high-point-ended-up-shorter-than/article_d028db66-74de-5868-b744-f5ef4828478a.html|work=[[Rapid City Journal]]|date=2016-12-26|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They considered it a sacred site within the Black Hills, which they call ''Pahá Sápa'' and ''Ȟé Sápa''.&lt;ref name="russell" /&gt;

The mountain was named Harney Peak in 1855 by American Lieutenant [[Gouverneur K. Warren]] in honor of US General [[William S. Harney]], his commander in a regional military expedition. In punitive retaliation for other Sioux raids, in September 1855 Harney's forces killed Brulé Sioux warriors, women and children in what Americans called the [[Battle of Blue Water Creek]] in [[Garden County, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name="blackelk"&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/12/breaking-black-elk-peak-soars-above-he-sapa-no-longer-harney-peak-165445 David Rooks, "Breaking: Black Elk Peak Soars Above The He Sapa, No Longer Harney Peak"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812220454/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/12/breaking-black-elk-peak-soars-above-he-sapa-no-longer-harney-peak-165445 |date=2016-08-12 }}, ''Indian Country Today,'' 12 August 2016; accessed 12 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Harney later commanded the United States military in the Black Hills area in the late 1870s.&lt;ref name="gnis"/&gt; 
The Lakota had tried to get the name of the peak changed for 50 years,&lt;ref name="argus"&gt;[http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/columnists/stu-whitney/2016/08/12/harney-peak-black-elk-daugaard-thune-south-dakota-native-american-stu-whitney/88627694/ Stu Whitney, "Whitney: In defense of Black Elk Peak"], ''Argus Leader,'' 12 August 2016; accessed 15 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as Harney had massacred their people.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt;

In 2014 the Sioux renewed their effort to get the name changed, in an effort led by Basil Brave Heart of the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. A [[Korean War]] veteran, he felt that Harney had not honored the military with his action.&lt;ref name="blackelk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="braveheart"&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/15/black-elk-peak-answer-many-prayers-basil-brave-heart-165456 David Rooks, "Black Elk Peak ‘Answer to Many Prayers’: Basil Brave Heart"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040023/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/15/black-elk-peak-answer-many-prayers-basil-brave-heart-165456 |date=2016-08-17 }}, ''Indian Country Today,'' 15 August 2016; accessed 15 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Lakota requested state officials in 2015 to reinstate their original name ''Hinhan Kaga'' for the peak. The Lakota Council of the Pine Ridge Reservation and descendants of [[Black Elk]], a noted medicine man, supported naming it for him, as the national wilderness area around the peak is named for the shaman.&lt;ref name="argus"/&gt;

He became known beyond the Lakota in part through the book ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]'' (1932), written by [[John G. Neihardt]] from long talks with the shaman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Nord |agency=Associated Press |date=May 1, 2015 |title=Activists work for Native American-friendly site names |work=The Elkhart Truth |url=http://www.elkharttruth.com/news/national/2015/05/01/Activists-work-for-Native-American-friendly-site-names.html }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lacey |last=Louwagie |date=July 6, 2015 |title=Despite Objections, 'Harney Peak' Name Stays |work=Courthouse News Service |url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/07/06/despite-objections-harney-peak-name-stays.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; South Dakota Governor [[Dennis Daugaard]] opposed the name change, as did other state officials, and no action was taken in 2015.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==History==
Hinhan Kaga and the Black Hills were protected within the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] established by the United States government in the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] in 1868; it covered most of the territory west of the Missouri River in South Dakota (the area now called [[West River (South Dakota)|West River]]). American settlement was concentrated east of the river, where there was more water for farming.

The first Americans believed to have reached the summit were a party led by General [[George Armstrong Custer]] in 1874, during the [[Custer's 1874 Black Hills Expedition|Black Hills expedition]]. He was looking for gold.&lt;ref name="Connell, Evan S. 1984 281"&gt;{{cite book |author=Connell, Evan S. |title=Son Of The Morning Star |location=San Francisco, California |publisher=North Point Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-86547-160-6 |pages=237–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government took back the Black Hills and another strip of land in a new treaty in 1877. More than a decade later, it broke up the Great Sioux Reservation in 1889 into five smaller reservations, the same year that North Dakota and South Dakota were admitted as states to the Union. The government made some 9 million acres of former Lakota land available for purchase for ranching and homesteading. Most American settlement in West River did not start until the early 20th century. The area attracted many European immigrants as well as migrants from the East.

Black Elk Peak is the site where [[Black Elk]] ([[Lakota Sioux]]) received his "Great Vision" when nine years old. He later became a [[medicine man]] known for his wisdom. Late in life, he returned to the peak accompanied by writer [[John Neihardt]]. Black Elk was sharing much of his life and philosophy with Neihardt through long talks translated by his son. Neihardt tried to express the [[medicine man]]'s wisdom in his book ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]'' (1932).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See chapter 3 and the Author's Postscript of ''Black Elk Speaks,'' Bison Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neihardt recorded Black Elk's words about his vision as follows: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was standing on the highest mountain of them all, and round about beneath me was the whole hoop of the world," he is quoted as saying. "And while I stood there I saw more than I can tell and I understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they must live together like one being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southdakota.com/harney-peak/371 |title=Harney Peak |publisher=SouthDakota.com|accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

American settlers used Black Elk Peak as a [[fire lookout tower]] in 1911, with a wood crate placed at the summit for a seat. In 1920, a 12'x12' wood structure was built, and it was expanded to 16'x16' the following year.  The federal [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] enlisted local men and completed [[Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) South Dakota|construction of a stone fire tower in 1938]], one of numerous projects in the state during the [[Great Depression]]. The Harney Peak [[fire lookout tower|fire tower]] was last staffed in 1967.&lt;ref name="Saum, Bradley D. 2013 34"&gt;{{cite book |author=Saum, Bradley D. |title=Harney Peak Revealed |publisher=Createspace |year=2013 |isbn=9781478316756 |pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A United States post office was operated at Black Elk Peak from 1936 until 1942, and again from 1945 until 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{GNIS|1926751|name=Harney Peak Post Office (historical)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harney Peak post office was reportedly one of the "most elevated post offices in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Federal Writers' Project]]|title=South Dakota place-names, v.1–3|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027015455;view=1up;seq=115|year=1940|publisher=University of South Dakota|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 the South Dakota Board of Geographic Names recommended renaming Harney Peak as ''Hinhan Kaga,'' to remove the name of a commander known for massacring Sioux women and children at the Battle of Blue Water Creek &lt;ref name="sdboard"&gt;{{cite web |author=South Dakota Board of Geographic Names |year=2015 |url=http://www.sdbgn.sd.gov/documents/comments/HarneyPeak/Harney_Peak_Written_Public_Comments_Received_at_Public_Meetings_Part1.pdf |title=Harney Peak Written Public Comments |publisher=South Dakota Board of Geographic Names |accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to honor the original Lakota name for the mountain.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; At the end of the following month, the board reversed the recommendation that the peak be renamed saying that "there was no public consensus on a new name."&lt;ref name="sdboard"/&gt; The Lakota were divided on a preferred name, and Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard and some other Americans opposed any name change.&lt;ref name="blackelk"/&gt;

The recommendation for renaming went to the federal US Board on Geographic Names.&lt;ref name=Pierre&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= In Reversal, SD Board Would Keep Harney Peak Name|url= http://www.kdlt.com/news/local-news/In-Reversal-SD-Board-Would-Keep-Harney-Peak-Name/33835740|publisher= Associated Press|location= Pierre, SD|date= 29 June 2015|access-date= 14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal board acknowledged that the name was of concern to the Lakota, and its spokesman said, "In this case, the board felt that the name was derogatory or offensive, being that it was on a holy site of the Native Americans."&lt;ref name="blackelk"/&gt; In a decision published August 11, 2016, the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] adopted the name "Black Elk Peak."&lt;ref name=Nord&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Nord |title= Feds Rename South Dakota's Highest Peak to Black Elk Peak|url= http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/feds-rename-south-dakotas-highest-peak-black-elk-41315318|publisher= ABC News|date= 11 August 2016|access-date= 11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hiking==
The summit can be reached from [[Sylvan Lake (South Dakota)|Sylvan Lake]], Camp Remington, Highway 244, Palmer Creek Rd., [[Mount Rushmore]], or [[Horse Thief Lake]]. From the [[trailhead]] at Sylvan Lake in [[Custer State Park]], to the summit and back is about {{convert|7|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="trailheads"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gfp.sd.gov/state-parks/directory/custer/trails/harney-trailheads.aspx |title=Harney Area Trailheads |publisher=South Dakota Fish, Game and Parks |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the shortest, least strenuous, and most popular route. No permit is required for use of the first portion of the trail. However, the [[United States Forest Service]] requires hikers to obtain a permit at a self-service kiosk located at the entrance to the Black Elk Wilderness area en route to the summit.&lt;ref name="sp"&gt;{{cite summitpost |id=150511 |name=Harney Peak |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An old stone tower, once used as a [[fire lookout tower]], is located at the summit. The ashes of [[Valentine McGillycuddy]] were interred near the base of the tower and a plaque reads, "Valentine McGillycuddy, Wasicu Wakan." ''Wasicu Wakan'' is [[Lakota language|Lakota]] for "Holy White Man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackhillstravelblog.com/mcgillycuddy-house-at-the-heart-of-city-history/ |title=McGillycuddy House at the heart of city history |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bochasan''' is a small town in [[Gujarat]], western [[India]]. It is known primarily as the origin of [[Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha]] (BAPS), so named because its first formal center was established in Bochasan in 1907 by its guru Shastriji Maharaj.

'''CIEL UK''' (Centre International d'Etudes Liturgiques - UK) is the British branch of [[:fr:Centre international d'études liturgiques|CIEL]], an international [[Roman Catholic]] society that is dedicated to scholarly analysis and pastoral familiarity of the traditional liturgy of the [[Roman Catholic]] Church (commonly referred to as the [[Tridentine Mass]]) within the English-speaking world, in collaboration with CIEL.

Each year CIEL UK organises an annual High Mass and conference in London and publishes English translations of the proceedings of the international CIEL Colloquia.

==2008 Mass and Conference==
The 2008 Mass and Conference took place on Saturday 31 May. High Mass was offered by Fr Ignatius Harrison in the [[London Oratory]] church at 11:00am, followed by the Conference at 2.30pm in St Wilfid's Hall. The theme of this year's conference was "The Liturgical Reforms of Benedict XVI" and a paper was given by distinguished liturgical scholar and deacon Rev Dr Alcuin Reid.

==2007 Mass and Conference==

The 2007 Annual Mass and conference took place at the London Oratory on Saturday 19 May. The Mass was celebrated by the Very Rev. Fr. Ignatius Harrison, Cong. Orat., Provost of the London Oratory. The Mass setting was [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]'s Missa Brevis, sung by the Choir of the London Oratory and directed by Patrick Russill. The theme of the conference given later that day was 'The liturgical devotions to Our Lady'. The speakers were Msgr. Michael Schmitz from the [[Institute of Christ the King]] and Rev. Fr. Jerome Bertram, Cong. Orat. from the [[Oxford Oratory]].

[[Image:Centzon Huitznahuac.jpg|thumb|{{lang|nci|[[Huītzilōpōchtli]]|italic=no}} kills {{lang|nci|Centzonhuītznāhua}}, [[Florentine codex]]]]
In [[Aztec mythology]], the '''{{lang|nci|Centzonhuītznāhua}}''' ({{IPA-nah|sent͡sonwiːtsˈnaːwa}} or, in plural, '''{{lang|nci|Centzon Huītznāuhtin}}''', {{IPA-nah|sent͡sonwiːtsˈnaːwtin|}}) were the gods of the southern [[star]]s. They are the evil elder sons of {{lang|nci|[[Cōātlīcue]]|italic=no}}, and their sister is {{lang|nci|[[Coyolxāuhqui]]|italic=no}}. They and their sister tried to murder their mother upon learning of her pregnancy with {{lang|nci|[[Huītzilōpōchtli]]|italic=no}}; their plan was thwarted when their brother sprang from the womb—fully grown and garbed for battle—and killed them all.

The {{lang|nci|Centzonhuītznāhua}} are known as the "Four Hundred Southerners"; the gods of the northern stars are the {{lang|nci|[[Centzonmīmixcōa]]}}.

The '''Church of Ireland''' ({{lang-ga|Eaglais na hÉireann}}; [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]]: ''Kirk o Airlann''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130225223255/http://www.nisra.gov.uk/archive/census/UlsterScots.pdf 2001 Northern Irish census leaflet, Ulster-Scots] NI Statistics and Research Agency. Retrieved 25 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Christian church]] in Ireland and an autonomous province of the [[Anglican Communion]]. It is organised on an [[all-Ireland]] basis and is the [[Christianity in Ireland|second-largest]] Christian church on the island after the [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland|Roman Catholic Church]]. Like other [[Anglican]] churches, it has retained elements of pre-Reformation practice, notably its [[episcopal polity]], while rejecting the [[Papal primacy|primacy of the Bishop of Rome]]. In theological and liturgical matters, it incorporates many principles of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], particularly those espoused during the [[English Reformation]]. The church self-identifies as being both [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Reformed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ireland.anglican.org/about/ "About Us", Church of Ireland website]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the church, differences exist between those members who are more Catholic-leaning ([[high church]]) and those who are more [[Protestantism|Protestant]]-leaning ([[low church]] or [[evangelical]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://stgeorges.connor.anglican.org/about-the-church-of-ireland/ Church of Ireland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113815/http://stgeorges.connor.anglican.org/about-the-church-of-ireland/ |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For historical and cultural reasons, the Church of Ireland is generally identified as a Protestant church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ireland.anglican.org/index.php?do=information&amp;id=6 Protestant and Catholic], APCK Study Leaflet, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Church of Ireland describes itself as
::that part of the Irish Church which was influenced by the Reformation, and has its origins in the early Celtic Church of St Patrick.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ireland.anglican.org/our-faith/what-we-believe "What we believe"] Church of Ireland official website.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Church of Ireland considers itself [[Catholic (term)|Catholic]] because it is in possession of a continuous tradition of faith and practice, based on scripture and early traditions, enshrined in the Catholic creeds, together with the sacraments and apostolic ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ireland.anglican.org/our-faith/apck/protestant-and-catholic "Protestant and Catholic"] Church of Ireland official website.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Church of Ireland is also [[Protestant]], or Reformed, since it opposes doctrines and ways of worshipping that it considers contrary to scripture and which led to the Reformation.
::The Church of Ireland, as a Reformed and Protestant Church, doth hereby re-affirm its constant witness against all those innovations in doctrine and worship whereby the Primitive faith hath been from time to time defaced or overlaid, and which at the Reformation this Church did disown and reject.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ireland.anglican.org/about/the-constitution "Preamble and Declaration of the Constitution of the Church of Ireland 1870, 1.3"] Church of Ireland official website.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:
When the English Parliament declared that the Holy See had no power over the Church in England, the Church in Ireland also conformed, assuming possession of most church property and so retaining a great repository of religious architecture and other items, though some were later destroyed. The church explains its possession of so many of the ancient church buildings of Ireland by reference to the precedent set by Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] in the 4th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the days of the Emperor Constantine in the 4th century European states saw themselves as having a central role in the government of the Church. This church-state link was vigorously applied when the Normans came to Ireland in the 12th century. Bishops were required to do homage to the king for their lands, just like earls and barons, who were vassals of the crown. It was therefore accepted, both during and after the Reformation, that the Crown should continue to exercise that authority over the church, in which it continued to play a central role. In this way, church property that existed at the time of the Reformation, buildings included, was retained by the Reformed, Established (state) Church of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ireland.anglican.org/our-faith/apck/irish-and-universal Irish and Universal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Ireland, the substantial majority of the population continued to adhere to Roman Catholicism, despite the political and economic advantages of membership in the state church. Despite its numerical minority, however, the Church of Ireland remained the official state church until the [[Irish Church Act 1869]] [[disestablishment|disestablished]] it on 1 January 1871, under [[Queen Victoria]] and her Liberal government led by [[William Ewart Gladstone]].

The Church of Ireland claimed that in breaking with Rome the reformed established church was reverting to a condition that had obtained in the church in Ireland prior to the 12th century – the independent character of [[Celtic Christianity]]. Modern scholarship, however, sees the early Irish church as different to but still a part of Roman Christianity, with the result that the Church of Ireland and the Irish Roman Catholic church can both claim descent from St Patrick.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas O'Loughlin, Journeys on the edges: the Celtic tradition,(London, 2000), Caitlin Corning, The Celtic and Roman traditions: conflict and consensus in the early medieval church (Basingstoke, 2006), Alan Ford, 'Shaping history: James Ussher and the Church of Ireland',  The Church of Ireland and its past: history, interpretation and identity, ed. Mark Empey, Alan Ford and Miriam Moffitt (Dublin, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of legitimacy for the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] were derived from a [[Papal Bull]] of 1155 – ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', although the governing structures in Ireland had never acknowledged any external authority over Ireland. The bull claimed to give King [[Henry II of England]] the right to invade Ireland, ostensibly as a means of reforming the church in Ireland more directly under the control of the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;Austin Lane Poole [https://books.google.com/books?id=PN6MO0_mwaAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=From+Domesday+book+to+Magna+Carta,+1087-1216&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aRVTELbz3m&amp;sig=3jhqLELEm9KkKCdCsiqynvo_cTg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JJkkTNjyO4jy0gSQxqG9BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=adrian&amp;f=false ''From Domesday book to Magna Carta, 1087–1216''] Oxford University Press, 1993, pp303-304 (readable on Google books)&lt;/ref&gt; The authorisation from the Holy See was based upon the putative [[Donation of Constantine]] which claimed to make every Christian island in the western [[Roman Empire]] the property of the Papacy, though as Ireland was never a part of the Roman Empire, it had no real relevance. By the time of the [[English Reformation]], the Donation had been exposed as a forgery, and Henry VIII sought to undo by enforcing laws regarding [[praemunire]] the historic royal homage to the Papacy that was delivered by [[John, King of England]] before him.

The Church of Ireland is the second largest church in Ireland and the third largest in [[Northern Ireland]], after the Roman Catholic and Presbyterian churches.

===16th to 18th centuries===
{{main|Reformation in Ireland}}
[[File:ArmaghCICathedral.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh]]]]
[[File:Ccclose.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin]]]]
The reformed Church of Ireland was founded in 1536 when the Irish Parliament accepted [[Henry_VIII_of_England|Henry VIII]] as its head, rather than the Pope. In 1155, [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]] claimed Ireland as a papal [[fief]] and granted [[Henry_II_of_England|Henry II]] the [[Lordship of Ireland]]; in 1541, Henry assumed the title [[Kingdom of Ireland|King of Ireland]], effectively denying Papal supremacy in Ireland.
The Irish Reformation was initially restricted to [[Dublin]], driven by its bishop, [[George_Browne_(archbishop_of_Dublin)|George Browne]], although when [[Edward VI]] succeeded in 1547, the pace of reform in both England and Ireland intensified. Catholicism was restored by [[Mary_I_of_England|Mary I]]; four bishops had to resign as they were married but the Marian period in Ireland was largely characterised by inertia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walshe |first1=Helen Coburn |title=Enforcing the Elizabethan Settlement: The Vicissitudes of Hugh Brady, Bishop of Meath, 1563-84 |journal=Irish Historical Studies |date=November 1989 |volume=26 |issue=104 |page=358 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30008693}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After [[Elizabeth_I_of_England|Elizabeth]] replaced Mary in 1558, only five Irish bishops accepted the 1560 [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|Elizabethan Settlement]], leaving the new administration with little alternative but to replace the vast majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walshe |first1=Helen Coburn |title=Enforcing the Elizabethan Settlement: The Vicissitudes of Hugh Brady, Bishop of Meath, 1563-84 |journal=Irish Historical Studies |date=November 1989 |volume=26 |issue=104 |page=360 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30008693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doing so was complicated by the lack of Irish-speaking clergy and poverty of the Church compared to its Catholic predecessor, while some of those who remained were of relatively low quality. For example, [[Hugh_Curwen|Hugh Curwen]] backed the reforms of Henry and Edward, returned to Catholicism under Mary who appointed him Roman Catholic [[Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Dublin|Archbishop of Dublin]] in 1555, before switching back to the Protestant faith under Elizabeth; he was later charged with moral delinquency by [[Adam_Loftus_(bishop)|Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Armagh]].

The project to convert the native Irish met with limited success in the 16th century, since &lt;blockquote&gt;'..in order to convert the native Irish, it needed native ministers; but the supply of native ministers was meagre because the native Irish were unconverted.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clarke |first1=Aidan |title=Varieties of Uniformity: The First Century of the Church of Ireland |journal=Studies in Church History |date=1989 |issue=Published online 2016 |page=120 |doi=10.1017/S042420840000861 |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; A gradualist policy was adopted, similar to that used for Catholic areas in Northern England, leading to "church papist" clergy and laity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muldoon |first1=Andrew |title=Recusants, Church-Papists, and "Comfortable" Missionaries: Assessing the Post-Reformation English Catholic Community |journal=The Catholic Historical Review |date=2000 |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=248-250 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25025711}}&lt;/ref&gt; This permitted nominal conformance with the established Church  "whilst continuing to worship...in the traditional, pre-Reformation manner". Officially abandoned in 1603, the practice of 'occasional conformity' persisted in both England and Ireland well into the mid-18th century. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flaningam |first1=John |title=The Occasional Conformity Controversy: Ideology and Party Politics, 1697-1711 |journal=Journal of British Studies |date=1977 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=39-41 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/175691 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:James Ussher by Sir Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[James Ussher]], [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] who played a major role in formulating Church doctrine ]]
The first translation of the New Testament into [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]] was begun by [[Nicholas_Walsh_(bishop)|Nicholas Walsh, Bishop of Ossory]]. This was continued after his death in 1585 by his assistant, John Kearny, and [[Nehemiah Donnellan]], [[Church of Ireland Archdiocese of Tuam|Archbishop of Tuam]], completed by Donnellan's successor [[William Daniel (archbishop)|William Daniel]] and printed in 1602. A translation of the Old Testament was prepared by [[William_Bedell|William Bedel, Bishop of Kilmore]] (1571–1642), but not published until 1685 in a revised version by [[Narcissus Marsh]] (1638–1713), Archbishop of Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Treasures of the Irish Language: Some early examples from Dublin City Public Libraries |url=http://www.dublinheritage.ie/historic_collections/irish_language_treasures.html |year=2006 |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309074657/http://www.dublinheritage.ie/historic_collections/irish_language_treasures.html |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bedell's Irish Old Testament|url=http://www.kingscollections.org/exhibitions/specialcollections/bible/european-bible/bedells-irish-old-testament|publisher=[[King's College London]]|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Bedell also translated the [[Book of Common Prayer]] in 1606, while an Irish version of the revised 1662 prayer book was published in 1712 by John Richardson (1664–1747).

However, the Church continued to be largely confined to the English-speaking minority in [[The Pale]]; Scots settlers in [[Plantation of Ulster|Ulster]] were predominantly Presbyterian, while the Irish-speaking majority retained their loyalty to the [[Holy See]]. Clergy were imported from England or Scotland, including [[James Ussher]], later [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] and primarily responsible for the Irish Articles. Similar to the Church of England's [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] drawn up by [[William_Laud|Archbishop Laud]], these are more detailed, less ambiguous and often explicitly Calvinist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wallace |first1=Raymond Leslie |title=The Articles of the Church of Ireland 1615 |date=1949 |publisher=University of Edinburgh; Unpublished doctoral thesis |pages=1 - 15 passim |url=https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/10183/0074207c.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1634, the Irish Parliament adopted Laud's 39 Articles in 1634 but Ussher ensured they were in addition to the Irish Articles, not a replacement. After the [[Restoration_(England)|Restoration of 1660]], the Thirty-Nine Articles were retained and remained the official doctrine of the Church of Ireland even after disestablishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.ix.vi.x.html Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes.

The policy adopted under [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] claimed the Church of Ireland to be the original and universal church, while the Papacy was an innovation, thus vesting it with the supremacy of [[Apostolic succession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richardson |first1=Joseph |title=Archbishop William King (1650-1729): 'Church Tory and State Whig'? |journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland / Iris an dá chultúr |date=2000 |volume=15 |page=55 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30071442}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Rome naturally disputed this interpretation, advocates included Ussher himself and Charles' former personal chaplain [[John Leslie (bishop of Raphoe)|John Leslie]], a key supporter of Caroline reforms in Scotland who was appointed bishop of [[Diocese_of_Derry_and_Raphoe|Derry &amp; Raphoe]] in 1633.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diamond |first1=Ciaran |title=John Leslie; 1571-1671 |journal=Oxford DNB |date=2009 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/16494|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-16494#odnb-9780198614128-e-16494|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1641-1653 [[Irish Confederate Wars]], nearly two-thirds of Ireland was controlled by the largely Catholic [[Confederate_Ireland|Confederacy]]. In 1644, [[Giovanni Battista Rinuccini]] became [[Papal_diplomacy|Papal Nuncio]] to Ireland; however, the Confederacy also included significant numbers of Royalist members of the Church of Ireland while Irish Catholicism had developed greater tolerance for Protestants and hostility to elaborate ritual. Rinuccini's refusal to compromise with the Church of Ireland and the re-introduction of ceremonies such as [[Foot_washing|foot washing]] divided the Confederacy and contributed to its rapid collapse in the 1649-1652 [[Cromwellian_conquest_of_Ireland|Cromwell's re-conquest of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yates |first1=Nigel |title=Catholic Reformation in Ireland: The Mission of Rinuccini 1645–1649 |url=https://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/catholic-reformation-in-ireland-the-mission-of-rinuccini-1645-1649/ |website=History Ireland |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[Williamite_War_in_Ireland|Williamite War]] in 1691, the Church re-established control; the 1697 Bishop's Banishment Act expelled all Catholic bishops and [[regular clergy]] from Ireland, leaving only the so-called [[secular clergy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simms |first1=J.G |title=The Bishops' Banishment Act of 1697 (9 Will. III, C. 1) |journal=rish Historical Studies |date=1970 |volume=17 |issue=66 |pages=185-186 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30005134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th to 20th centuries===
[[File:Cavan church of ireland.jpg|thumb|right|Church of Ireland Parish in [[Cavan]]]]
[[File:Ardclinis Church of Ireland Carnlough.JPG|thumb|right|Church of Ireland Parish in [[Carnlough]]]]
Following the legal union of Ireland and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] by the [[Act of Union 1800]], the Church of Ireland was also united with the Church of England to form the '''United Church of England and Ireland'''. At the same time, one archbishop and three bishops from Ireland (selected by rotation) were given seats in the [[House of Lords]] at Westminster, joining the two archbishops and twenty-four bishops from the Church of England.

In 1833, the British Government introduced the [[Church Temporalities (Ireland) Act 1833|Irish Church Temporalities Bill]] which proposed the administrative and financial restructuring of the church. The bill sought to reduce the number of both bishoprics and archbishoprics from 22 to 12, to change the structure of the leases of church lands and to apply the revenues saved by these changes for the use of parishes. The bill, not only had implications for the future political trajectory of the Whigs and Tories but also sparked the generation of the [[Oxford Movement]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} which was to have wide repercussions for the Anglican Communion.

As the official established church, the Church of Ireland was mainly funded by [[tithes]] imposed on all Irish subjects of the Crown. Irrespective of the fact that the adherents of the church were never more than a small minority of the populace, the population at large was expected to pay for its upkeep. Following the defeat of Roman Catholic arms in 1691, no armed resistance was to be expected to this discriminatory policy. Nevertheless, peasant resentment of the tithes occasionally boiled over, as in the "[[Tithe War]]" of 1831–36. Eventually, the tithes were ended, replaced with a lower levy called the ''tithe rent charge''. The last remnant of the tithes was not abolished until disestablishment in 1871.

The [[Irish Church Act 1869]] (which took effect on 1 January 1871) finally ended the role of the Church of Ireland as the state church. Disestablishment terminated both state support and parliament's role in its governance, but also took into government ownership much church property. At the establishment of the state church, no compensation had been given to Roman Catholic clergy who suffered loss in the seizure of church property by the state; at its disestablishment, compensation was provided to clergy by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crossdenominationalmission.org.uk/churchinireland.html Cross Denominational Mission "The Irish Church Disestablishment Act 1869 came into effect in 1871 and the Church of Ireland ceased to be the state church. This terminated both state support and parliamentary authority over its governance, and took into public ownership much church property. Compensation was provided to clergy, but many parishes faced great difficulty after the loss of rent-generating land, property and buildings."]&lt;/ref&gt; On both occasions, parishes faced great difficulty in local financing after the loss of rent-generating lands and buildings. With disestablishment, the church's representation in the House of Lords also ceased.

==Governance==
The head of the Church of Ireland is, &lt;i&gt;ex officio&lt;/i&gt;, the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]]. In 1870, immediately prior to its disestablishment, the Church provided for its internal government, led by a General Synod, and with financial and administrative support by a Representative Church Body. Like other Irish churches, the Church of Ireland did not divide when Ireland was [[Partition of Ireland|partitioned]] in the 1920s and it continues to be governed on an all-Ireland basis.

===Structure===
[[File:Dioceses of the Church of Ireland.png|thumb|right|alt=Dioceses of the Church of Ireland|Map of the dioceses of the Church of Ireland &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="color:#AC7136;"&gt;▉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#A0958A;"&gt;▉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#60584F;"&gt;▉&lt;/span&gt; Province of Armagh&lt;br/&gt;

{{see also|List of Anglican dioceses in the United Kingdom and Ireland}}
The polity of the Church of Ireland is [[episcopal church governance]], as in other Anglican churches. The church maintains the traditional structure dating to pre-Reformation times, a system of geographical [[Ecclesiastical parish|parishes]] organised into [[diocese]]s. There were more than 30 of these historically, grouped into four provinces; today, after consolidation over the centuries, there are [[List of Church of Ireland dioceses|12 Church of Ireland dioceses or united dioceses]], each headed by a bishop and belonging to one of two surviving provinces. 

The leader of the [[Province of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|southern province]] is the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]], at present [[Michael Jackson (bishop)|Michael Jackson]]; that of the [[Province of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|northern province]] is the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]], at present [[Richard Clarke (bishop)|Richard Clarke]]. These two archbishops are styled [[Primate of Ireland]] and [[Primate of All Ireland]] respectively, suggesting the ultimate seniority of the latter. Although he has relatively little absolute authority, the Archbishop of Armagh is respected as the church's general leader and spokesman, and is elected in a process different from those for all other bishops.

===General Synod and policy-making===
Doctrine, canon law, church governance, church policy, and liturgical matters are decided by the church's [[General Synod]]. The General Synod comprises two Houses, the House of Bishops and the House of Representatives. The House of Bishops includes the 10 diocesan bishops and two archbishops, forming one order. The House of Representatives is made up of two orders, clergy and [[laity]]. The order of clergy holds one third of the seats while the laity holds two thirds of the seats.&lt;ref&gt;Dublin, Ireland,
 2003:  Constitution of the Church of Ireland, 1.1 The General Synod of the Church of Ireland shall consist of three distinct orders, namely, the bishops, the clergy, and the laity. / 1.2 The General Synod shall consist of two Houses, namely, the House of Bishops and the House of Representatives... / 1.3 The House of Bishops shall consist of all the archbishops and bishops of the Church of Ireland for the time being.{{rp|page=1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, there are 216 clergy members and 432 lay members in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Dublin, Ireland, 2003:  Constitution of the Church of Ireland, 1.4(i) The House of Representatives shall consist of 216 representatives of the clergy and 432 representatives of the laity...{{rp|page=1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membership of the House of Representatives is made up of delegates from the dioceses, with seats allocated to each diocese's clergy and laity in specific numbers; these delegates are elected every three years.&lt;ref&gt;Dublin, Ireland, 2003:  Constitution of the Church of Ireland, 1.4-5{{rp|page=1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Synod meets annually, and special meetings can be called by the leading bishop or one third of any of its orders.&lt;ref&gt;Dublin, Ireland, 2003:  Constitution of the Church of Ireland, 1.14-15 There shall be an ordinary meeting of the General Synod in every year, at such time and place as shall from time to time be prescribed in that behalf by the General Synod....{{rp|page=1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Changes in policy must be passed by a simple majority of both the House of Bishops and the House of Representatives. Changes to doctrine, for example the decision to ordain women as priests, must be passed by a two thirds majority of both Houses.  

The two Houses sit together for general deliberations but separate for some discussions and for voting.  While the House of Representatives always votes publicly, often by orders, the House of Bishops has tended to vote in private, coming to a decision before matters reach the floor of the synod. This practice has been broken only once when, in 1999, the House of Bishops voted unanimously in public to endorse the efforts of the Archbishop of Armagh, the Diocese of Armagh and the Standing Committee of the General Synod in their attempts to resolve [[Drumcree conflict|the crisis at the Church of the Ascension at Drumcree]] near [[Portadown]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ireland.anglican.org/archives/synods/synod99/synodnews/sectrepmot.html Sectarianism Report Motions]. Ireland.anglican.org. Retrieved on 23 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statutes and Constitution====
The Church's internal laws are formulated as bills proposed to the Houses of the General Synod, which when passed become Statutes.  The Church's governing document, the Constitution, is modified, consolidated and published by way of Statute also, the most recent edition, the 13th, being so published in 2003.

====Representative Body====
The Representative Body of the Church of Ireland, often called the "Representative Church Body" (RCB), is the corporate trustee of the church, as established by law, and much of the church's property is vested in it.  The members of the RCB are the bishops plus diocesan delegates and twelve co-opted members, and it meets at least four times a year.  The staff of the Representative Body are analogous to clerical civil servants, and among other duties they oversee property, including church buildings, cemeteries and investments, administer some salaries and pensions, and manage the church library.  While parishes, dioceses, and other parts of the church structure care for their particular properties, this is often subject to RCB rules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/pdf/Resources/ParishResources/SelectVestry/Church-of-Ireland-Overview-28-03-17.pdf Church of Ireland overview (Parish Handbook)]{{rp|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orders of ministry and positions===
The Church of Ireland embraces three orders of ministry: deacons, priests (or presbyters) and bishops. These orders are distinct from positions such as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|rector]], [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] or [[Canon (priest)|canon]].

===Diocesan Governance===
Each diocese or united diocese is led by its Ordinary, one of the ten bishops and two archbishops, and the Ordinary may have one or more Archdeacons to support them, along with a Rural Dean for each group of parishes.  There is a Diocescan Synod for each diocese; there may be separate synods for historic dioceses now in unions.  These synods comprise the bishop along with clergy and lay representatives from the parishes, and subject to the laws of the Church, and the work of the General Synod and its committees and the Representative Church Body and its committees, oversee the operation of the diocese.  Each diocesan synod in turn appoints a Diocesan Council to which it can delegate powers.

===Parochial Governance===
Each parish has a presiding member of the clergy, assisted by two churchwardens and often also two glebewardens, one of each type of warden being appointed by the clerical incumbent, and one by popular vote.  All qualified adult members of the parish comprise the General Vestry, which meets annually, within 20 days each side of Easter, as the Easter Vestry.  There is also a Select Vestry for the parish, or sometimes for each active church in a parish, comprising the presiding cleric and any curate assistants, along with relevant churchwardens and glebewardens and a number of members elected at the Easter Vestry meeting.  The Select Vestry assists in the care and operation of the parish and one or more church buildings.

===Cathedral governance===
Special provisions apply to the management and operation of five key cathedrals, in Dublin, Armagh, Down and Belfast.

===Tribunals===
The Church has disciplinary and appeals tribunals, and diocesan courts, and a Court of the General Synod.

==Present==
===Membership===
The Church of Ireland experienced a major decline in membership during the 20th century, both in Northern Ireland, where around 65% of its members live, and in the Republic of Ireland. The church is still the second-largest in the [[Republic of Ireland]], with around 126,400 members in 2016 (minus 2% compared to the 2011 census results)&lt;ref name="Census 2016 Results"&gt;[http://www.thejournal.ie/census-2016-statistics-3326599-Apr2017/ ''Census 2016 Results''].&lt;/ref&gt; and the third-largest in [[Northern Ireland]], with around 260,000 members.&lt;ref name=2011ks&gt;{{cite web|title=Census 2011: Key Statistics for Northern Ireland|url=http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/key_stats_bulletin_2011.pdf|publisher=nisra.gov.uk|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nisra.gov.uk"&gt;[http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/key_report_2011.pdf 2011 Census, Key Statistics for Northern Ireland, December 2012, p. 19.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cathedrals===
The Church of Ireland has two cathedrals in Dublin: within the line of the walls of the old city is [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]], the seat of the Archbishop of Dublin, and just outside the old walls is [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], which the church designated as the National Cathedral for Ireland in 1870. Cathedrals also exist in the other dioceses. 

===Offices, training of priests and teachers===
The church's central offices are in [[Rathmines]], adjacent to the former [[Church of Ireland College of Education]], and the Church's library is in Churchtown. Teacher training now occurs within the [[Dublin City University]] Institute of Education, overseen by the Church of Ireland Centre, based at the former [[All Hallows College]].  The church operates a seminary, the Church of Ireland Theological Institute, in [[Rathgar]], in the south inner suburbs of Dublin. 

===The Anglican Communion===
[[File:Saul church County Down sign.jpg|thumb|[[Saul, County Down|Saul]] church, a modern replica of an early church with a [[Irish round tower|round tower]], is built on the reputed spot of [[Saint Patrick|St Patrick's]] first church in Ireland.]]
The Churches of the Anglican Communion are linked by affection and common loyalty. They are in full communion with the [[Episcopal see|See]] [[Archdiocese of Canterbury|of Canterbury]] and thus the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in his person, is a unique focus of Anglican unity. He calls the once-a-decade Lambeth Conference, chairs the meeting of Primates, and is President of the Anglican Consultative Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/resources/acis/docs/unity.cfm Anglican Communion Official Website.]&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Church of Ireland, despite having a number of [[High Church]] (often described as [[Anglo-Catholic]]) parishes, is generally on the [[Low Church]] end of the spectrum of world [[Anglicanism]]. Historically, it had little of the difference in organisation between parishes characteristic of other Anglican provinces, although a number of markedly liberal, High Church or [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] parishes have developed in recent decades. It was the second province of the Anglican Communion after the [[Anglican Church of New Zealand]] (1857) to adopt, on its 1871 disestablishment, [[Synod|synodical government]]. It was also one of the first provinces to begin ordaining women to the priesthood (1991).

====Relation with the GAFCON movement====
[[Global Anglican Future Conference|GAFCON]] Ireland was launched on 21 April 2018, in [[Belfast]], with 320 attendees from the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. International speakers included Archbishops [[Peter Jensen (bishop)|Peter Jensen]], retired Archbishop of [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney|Sydney]], and [[Gregory Venables]], Primate of the [[Anglican Church of South America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gafcon.org/news/bringing-the-true-gospel-of-jesus-christ-to-ireland Bringing the true Gospel of Jesus Christ to Ireland, GAFCON Official Website, 26 April 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Ireland was represented at [[Global Anglican Future Conference|GAFCON III]], held on 17-22 June 2018 in [[Jerusalem]], by a six-member delegation, which included two bishops, [[Ferran Glenfield]], of [[Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh|Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]], and [[Harold Miller (bishop)|Harold Miller]], of [[Diocese of Down and Dromore|Down and Dromore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicanink.com/article/gafcon-iii-largest-pan-anglican-gathering-toronto-congress-1963 GAFCON III largest pan-Anglican gathering since Toronto Congress of 1963, Anglican Ink, 20 June 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.downanddromore.org/news/2018/06/Bishop-Harold-reflects-on-his-experience-of-the-recent-GAFCON-conference#.W3i2o-j7QdV Bishop Harold reflects on his experience of the recent GAFCON conference, Diocese of Down and Dromore Official Website, 25 June 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenical relations===
Like many other Anglican churches, the Church of Ireland is a member of many ecumenical bodies, including the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[Conference of European Churches]], [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]], and the [[Irish Council of Churches]]. It is also a member of the [[Porvoo Communion]].

===Flags===
[[File:St Paul's Church, Parish of Diamond Grange - geograph.org.uk - 196892.jpg|thumb|right|Parish Church with [[Union Flag]]]]
In 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Journal of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland 1999|url=https://www.ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/pdf/Synod/Journal1999.pdf|journal=1999|volume=|pages=69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the church voted to prohibit the flying of flags other than [[St Patrick's flag]] and the [[Flag of the Anglican Communion]].&lt;ref&gt;Flags of the World: [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ie-stpat.html#cofi St. Patrick's Flag as flag of Church of Ireland]: "The General Synod of the Church of Ireland recognises that from time to time confusion and controversy have attended the flying of flags on church buildings or within the grounds of church buildings. This Synod therefore resolves that the only flags specifically authorised to be flown on church buildings or within the church grounds of the Church of Ireland are the cross of St Patrick or, alternatively, the flag of the Anglican Communion bearing the emblem of the Compassrose. Such flags are authorised to be flown only on Holy Days and during the Octaves of Christmas, Easter, the Ascension of Our Lord, Pentecost, and on any other such day as may be recognised locally as the Dedication Day of the particular church building. Any other flag flown at any other time is not specifically authorised by this Church...."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Union Flag]] continues to fly on many churches in [[Northern Ireland]].

===Publications===
The church has an official website.  Its journal is [[The Church of Ireland Gazette]], which is editorially independent, but the governing body of which is appointed by the Church.  Many parishes and other internal organizations also produce newsletters or other publications, as well as maintaining websites.

===Core doctrine===
The centre of the Church of Ireland's teaching is the life, death and resurrection of [[Jesus Christ]]. The basic teachings of the church include:
* [[Chalcedonianism|Chalcedonian]] [[Christology]]; Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God in one person. He died and was resurrected from the dead.
* Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe.
* The Old and New Testaments of the Bible ("God's Word written") were written by people "under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit". The Apocrypha are additional books that are to be read, but not to determine doctrine. The [[Biblical apocrypha#King James Version|Apocrypha of the King James version]] of the Bible constitutes the books of the [[Vulgate]] version that are present neither in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Old Testament]] nor the Greek [[New Testament]].
* The "two great and necessary" [[Anglican sacraments|sacraments]] are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] (also called Holy Communion and the Lord's Supper).
* Those [[Anglican sacraments|"commonly called Sacraments that are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel"]] are [[confirmation]], [[ordination]], marriage, [[Confession (religion)|reconciliation of a penitent]] and [[unction]].
* Belief in [[heaven]], [[hell]] and [[second coming|Jesus's return in glory]].

The 16th-century apologist, [[Richard Hooker]], posits that there are three sources of authority in Anglicanism: scripture, tradition and reason. It is not known how widely accepted this idea is within Anglicanism. It is further posited that the three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine; things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicanlistening.org/anglican_listening_61766_ENG_HTM.htm Anglican Listening] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705192528/http://www.anglicanlistening.org/anglican_listening_61766_ENG_HTM.htm |date=5 July 2008 }} Detail on how scripture, tradition and reason work to "uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern doctrinal debates===
==== Ordination of women ====
In recent decades, the church has ordained women to all offices. In 1990 the church began ordaining women to the priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/church-of-ireland-ordains-first-two-women-priests/article_578ce529-8789-5d1b-b069-1db8d76a4b88.html|title=Church of Ireland Ordains First Two Women Priests|website=Tulsa World|access-date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two women ordained were [[Kathleen Margaret Brown]] and [[Irene Templeton]]. In 2013, the church appointed its first woman bishop, [[Pat Storey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/20/anglicans-appoint-first-woman-bishop-rev-pat-storey|title=Anglicans appoint first female bishop in UK and Ireland|last=Staff and agencies|date=20 September 2013|website=the Guardian|access-date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Same-sex unions and LGBT clergy ====
{{See also|Homosexuality and the Anglican Communion}}

The church has been divided over aspects of human sexuality. In 2002, the issue became pertinent as a vicar provided a blessing for a lesbian couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tierney|first1=Ciaran|title=Lesbian couple get church blessing.(News)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92208364.html|website=highbeam.com|publisher=The Mirror|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The denomination announced a period of discernment to allocate time to the perspectives within the discussion. In 2010, a congregation was recognised by the church for receiving an LGBTI award for offering services for LGBTI people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ireland.anglican.org/news/3278|title=Church of Ireland – A Member of the Anglican Communion|last=Synod|first=Central Communications Board of the General|website=ireland.anglican.org|access-date=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical issues===
====Irish language====
The first translation of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] into Irish was published in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was published in 1712.

The Church of Ireland has its own Irish language body, ''Cumann Gaelach na hEaglaise'' ("Irish Guild of the Church" - [http://www.gaeleaglais.ie/ www.gaeleaglais.ie]). This was founded in 1914 to bring together members of the Church of Ireland interested in the [[Irish language]] and Gaelic culture and to promote the Irish language within the Church of Ireland. The guild aims to link its programmes with the Irish language initiatives which have been centred round [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]]. It holds services twice a month in Irish.&lt;ref&gt;Church of Ireland Notes, page 2, Irish Times, 10 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1926 to 1995, the church had its own Irish-language teacher training college, ''[[Coláiste Moibhí]]''. Today, there are a number of interdenominational ''[[Gaelscoileanna]]'' (schools where [[Irish-medium education]] is applied).

The '''Concordat of 1854''' was an international treaty between the president of the [[Guatemala|Republic of Guatemala]] - General Captain [[Rafael Carrera]] - and the [[Holy See]], which was signed in 1852 and ratified by both parties in 1854. Through this, Guatemala gave the education of Guatemalan people to regular orders [[Catholic Church]], committed to respect ecclesiastical property and monasteries, imposed mandatory tithing and allowed the bishops to censor what was published in the country; in return, Guatemala received dispensations for the members of the army, allowed those who had acquired the properties that the Liberals had expropriated the Church in 1829 to keep those properties, perceived taxes generated by the properties of the Church, and had the right to judge certain crimes committed by clergy under Guatemalan law.{{sfn | Aycinena | 1854 | p = 2-16}} The concordat was designed by [[Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol]] and reestablished the relationship between Church and State in Guatemala.  It was in force until the fall of the conservative government of Marshal [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]]

'''Criminon''' is a program for [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitating]] [[prison]]ers using [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s teachings. Criminon International, a [[non-profit]], [[public-benefit corporation]] managing the Criminon program, was spawned from [[Narconon International]] in 2000, and is part of [[Association for Better Living and Education]]'s public outreach programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Form 990 | version = 2000 | date = 2001-11-20 | url= http://www.eri-nonprofit-salaries.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=NPO.Summary&amp;EIN=952769582 | accessdate = 2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminon is promoted by the [[Church of Scientology International]]. Independent experts contend that methods used by the program are not supported by any scientific studies.&lt;ref name="takingchance"&gt;{{cite news | last = Garcia | first = David Alire | title = Taking Chances | publisher = Santa Fe Reporter | date = 2009-06-16 | url = http://sfreporter.com/stories/taking_chances/1323/ | accessdate = 2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawmakersshyaway"&gt;{{cite news | last = Neff | first = Erin | title = Lawmakers shy away from prison project | publisher = Las Vegas SUN, Inc. | date = 2003-02-14 | url = http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2003/feb/14/lawmakers-shy-away-from-prison-project/ | accessdate = 2009-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Second Chance Program|Second Chance]], another prison-based rehabilitation program for inmates, is closely related to Criminon, from which it licenses the techniques and materials used in its program.&lt;ref name="takingchance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lawmakersshyaway" /&gt;

Criminon is said to be a prison-based version of [[Narconon]], as the [[Purification Rundown]] detoxification and training procedures are a part of both programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Prozac Frees Ex-Scientology Leader from Depression | work = The Psychiatric Times | pages = 1 | publisher = CME, Inc. | date = June 1991  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminon's program==
The program has used correspondence materials to treat hundreds of prisoners at the high security [[California State Prison, Corcoran]], beginning in 1990.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;"Scientologists Reach Behind Bars", 29 May 2005, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Criminon is administered by the [[Association for Better Living and Education]] (ABLE), a nonprofit organization that administers Criminon, [[Narconon]], and other "social betterment" programs.&lt;ref name="Ties to church"&gt;Craig Pittman ''[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/16998459.html?dids=16998459:16998459&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Feb+2%2C+1997&amp;author=CRAIG+PITTMAN&amp;pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp; "Classes for defendants have ties to church"]'' [[St. Petersburg Times]] February 2, 1997 pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The program includes courses with questions requiring written answers. The responses are evaluated by volunteers and the materials are donated, so the program is provided free to the state. Included in one pamphlet is an essay in which Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] writes, "There is not one institutional psychiatrist alive who by ordinary criminal law could not be arraigned and convicted of extortion, mayhem, or murder."&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, [http://www.lronhubbard.org.mx/eng/fightrae/page080.htm "Crime and Psychiatry"], 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's 1981 booklet, ''[[The Way to Happiness]]'', is an integral part of the program, setting forth precepts such as "Do not take harmful drugs", "Be faithful to your sexual partner", "Do not tell harmful lies", "Don't do anything illegal", "Do not steal", and "Do not murder".

Criminon is also available under the name Second Chance, which licenses the Criminon materials.

==Controversies==
Some critics question the long-term success of Criminon's program citing a lack of independent, peer-reviewed studies.&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; As Criminon's website notes, the core of the prison program is the booklet ''[[The Way to Happiness]]''.

In 1997, Judge Stephen Rushing, a [[Pinellas County, Florida]], judge, received criticism and raised eyebrows from other judges when he began sentencing defendants to a program called "Impulse Control" that was run by Criminon. Rushing said the people running the course promised they would not try to convert anyone. However the paper noted that many critics have suggested that Criminon was being used as a recruiting tool. Rushing stated that if the program turned out to be nothing but a ploy to promote Scientology, "I owe an apology to the people I put in that program."&lt;ref name="Ties to church" /&gt;

Criminon has also been criticized for promoting Scientology's [[Scientology and psychiatry|hostile view of psychiatry]]. A Criminon instruction manual found at California's Corcoran Prison in 2005 instructs the supervisors who are supposed to be helping the inmates to encourage them to stop taking any psychiatric medication. "Most jails and prisons have a staff psychiatrist that goes in daily and gives dosages of various and sundry mind-altering drugs to the inmates. Most of the time this is a ploy to keep the inmates sedated so that they don't cause trouble", the manual stated. While Criminon claimed that this manual was "outdated", the replacement manual still advised that if inmates seemed angry, it may be because "some of them are on psychiatric drugs and have strange side effects as a result."&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; Professor [[Stephen A. Kent]] said that Scientology's goal "is to destroy psychiatry and replace it with Scientology's own treatments. Criminon is simply one of many Scientology organizations that hope to see this goal realized."&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt;

In 2006, in [[New Mexico]], government funding for the Second Chance program was cut when information on the program and its connections came to light.&lt;ref name="takingchance" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Drug-rehab deal linked to politics, Scientology | url = http://www.krqe.com/Video/expanded.asp?RECORD_KEY(Video)=ID&amp;ID%5BVideo%5D=4835 | format = video | publisher = KRQE News 13 | date = 2006-08-29 | accessdate = 2007-01-16}} Albuquerque, New Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then-[[Nevada]] assembly member [[Sharron Angle]] supported the use of "[[Second Chance Program]]" in 2003.&lt;ref name="lawmakersurged"&gt;{{cite news| last = Vogel | first =Ed   | title = Lawmakers urged to skip trip to view prison program | work = [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] | page = 7B | date = February 14, 2003  |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2003/Feb-14-Fri-2003/news/20691442.html|accessdate=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Angle sponsored legislation aimed at placing this program in women's prisons in Nevada.&lt;ref name="lawmakersurged" /&gt;

[[Image:Schedel'sche Weltchronik-Dog head.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A cynocephalus. From the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493).]]
The characteristic of '''cynocephaly''', or '''cynocephalus''' ({{IPAc-en|s|aɪ|n|oʊ|ˈ|s|ɛ|f|ə|l|i}}), having the [[head]] of a [[dog]]—or of a [[jackal]]—is a widely attested mythical phenomenon existing in many different forms and contexts. The literal meaning of "cynocephaly" is "dog-headed"; however, that this refers to a human body with a dog head is implied. Often, such creatures also have human intelligence. Such cynocephalics are known in mythology and legend from many parts of the world, including ancient Egypt, Greece, and China. Further mentions come from the medieval East and Europe. In modern popular culture cynocephalics are also encountered as characters in books, comics, and graphic novels. Cynocephaly is generally distinguished from [[lycanthropy]] (werewolfism) and dogs that can talk.

==Etymology==
The word ''cynocephaly'' is taken (through Latin) from the Greek word κῠνοκέφᾰλοι ''kynokephaloi'', from ''kyno–'' (combining form of κύων ''kyōn'') meaning "dog" and κεφαλή ''kephalē'' meaning "head".

The same "dog" root is found in the name ''Cynomorpha'' ("dog-shaped") for a sub-group of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Cercopithecidae]], which contains many species of [[macaque]]s and [[baboon]]s.

==Ancient Greece and Egypt==
Cynocephaly was familiar to the [[ancient Greeks]] from representations of the [[Egyptian gods]], [[Duamutef]] (Son of Horus), [[Wepwawet]] (The opener of the ways), and [[Anubis]] (the Egyptian god of the dead). The Greek word ''({{lang-el|κῠνοκέφᾰλοι}})'' "dog-head" also identified a sacred [[Egypt]]ian [[baboon]] with the face of a dog.&lt;ref&gt;The [[binomial name]] for the [[yellow baboon]] is ''Papio cynocephalus'', while ''Cynocephalus'' has also been adopted as the [[genus]] name for an Asian arboreal gliding mammal also known as a [[colugo]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of dog-headed races can also be traced back to Greek antiquity. In the fifth century BC, the Greek physician [[Ctesias]], in his [[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]], wrote a detailed report on the existence of cynocephali in India.&lt;ref&gt;Ctesias, ''Indica'' §§ 37, 40–3&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Greek traveller [[Megasthenes]] claimed to know about dog-headed people in India who lived in the mountains, communicated through barking, wore the skins of wild animals and lived by hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Megasthenes, ''Indica'', vis-a-vis [[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'' 7.2: 14–22; Fragments XXX. B. Solin. 52. 26–30.&lt;/ref&gt;
Herodotus reports claims by [[ancient Libya]]ns that such creatures inhabit the east of their lands, as well as [[headless men]] and various other anomalies.&lt;ref name="herodotus"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+4.191&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 |author=Herodotus |others=translated by A. D. Godley |title=The Histories |at=4.191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best estimate for the place where the battle between the Argonauts and the Cynocephali took place is modern day North [[Serbia]], or South [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="argonauts"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.sigmabooks.gr/maps_en_enArgoEur.html | title= The Expedition of the Argonauts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late Antiquity==
The cynocephali offered such an evocative image of the magic and brutality deemed characteristic of bizarre people of distant places that they kept returning in medieval literature. [[Augustine of Hippo]] mentioned the cynocephali in ''[[The City of God]]'', Book XVI, Chapter 8, in the context of discussing whether such beings were descendants of Adam; he considered the possibility that they might not exist at all, or might not be human (which Augustine defines as being a mortal and rational animal: ''homo, id est animal rationale mortale''), but insisted that if they were human they were indeed descendants of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo]], ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', Book XVI, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval East==
Cynocephali also figure in medieval Christian world-views. A legend that placed [[St. Andrew]] and [[St. Bartholomew]] among the [[Parthia]]ns presented the case of "Abominable", the citizen of the "city of cannibals... whose face was like unto that of a dog." After receiving baptism, however, he was released from his doggish aspect.&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon White, ''Myths of the Dog-man'' (University of Chicago Press) 1991:32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Christopher===
[[Image:Saint christopher cynocephalus.gif|thumb|Cynocephalus [[St. Christopher]]|251x251px]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], certain icons covertly identify [[Saint Christopher]] with the head of a dog. The background to the dog-headed Christopher is laid in the reign of the Emperor [[Diocletian]], when a man named ''Reprebus'', ''Rebrebus'' or ''Reprobus'' (the "reprobate" or "scoundrel") was captured in combat against tribes dwelling to the west of [[Egypt]] in [[Cyrenaica]]. To the unit of soldiers, according to the [[Hagiography|hagiographic narrative]], was assigned the name ''numerus Marmaritarum'' or "Unit of the Marmaritae", which suggests an otherwise-unidentified "Marmaritae" (perhaps the same as the Marmaricae [[Berber people|Berber]] tribe of [[Cyrenaica]]).  He was reported to be of enormous size, with the head of a dog instead of a man, apparently a characteristic of the Marmaritae. This Byzantine depiction of St. Christopher as dog-headed resulted from their misinterpretation of the Latin term Cananeus ([[Canaan]]ite)  to read canineus, that is, "canine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ross, L. |title=Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary |publisher=Westport |date=1996 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German bishop and poet [[Walter of Speyer]] portrayed St. Christopher as a giant of a cynocephalic species in the land of the Chananeans (Canaan in the New Testament) who ate human flesh and barked. Eventually, Christopher met the Christ child, regretted his former behavior, and received baptism. He, too, was rewarded with a human appearance, whereupon he devoted his life to Christian service and became an [[athlete of God]], one of the [[soldier-saint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter of Speyer]], ''Vita et passio sancti Christopher martyris,'' 75.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some rare icons that depict this martyr with the head of a dog. Such images may carry echoes of the Egyptian dog-headed god, [[Anubis]]. Christopher pictured with a dog's head is not generally supported by the Orthodox Church, as the icon was proscribed in the 18th century by Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.orthodoxartsjournal.org/the-icon-of-st-christopher/ Pageau, Jonathan. "Understanding The Dog-Headed Icon of St-Christopher", ''Orthodox Arts Journal'', July 8, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ibn Battuta ===
Ibn Battuta encountered dog-mouthed people on his journey, in an island somewhere between India and [[Sumatra]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Travels in Asia and Africa 1325-1354 by Ibn Battuta|last=Bontekoe|first=Willem|publisher=George Routledge and Sons|year=1929|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=Fifteen days after leaving Sunaridwan we reached the country of the Barahnakar, whose mouths are like those of dogs. This tribe is a rabble, professing neither the religion of the Hindus nor any other. They live in reed huts roofed with grasses on the seashore, and have abundant banana, areca, and betel trees. Their men are shaped like ourselves, except that their mouths are shaped like those of dogs; this is not the case with their womenfolk, however, who are endowed with surpassing beauty. Their men too go unclothed, not even hiding their nakedness, except occasionally for an ornamental pouch of reeds suspended from their waist. The women wear aprons of leaves of trees. With them reside a number of Muslims from Bengal and Sumatra, who occupy a separate quarter. The natives do all their trafficking with the merchants on the shore, and bring them water on elephants, because the water is at some distance from the coast and they will not let the merchants go to draw it for themselves, fearing for their women because they make advances to well-formed men. Elephants are numerous in their land, but no one may dispose of them except the sultan, from whom they are bought in exchange for woven stuffs.|sign=Ibn Battuta|source=}}

==Medieval West==
[[Image:Kievskaya psaltir kinocefal.jpg|thumb|right|Cynocephali illustrated in the [[Kievan psalter]], 1397]]

[[Paul the Deacon]] mentions cynocephali in his ''Historia gentis Langobardorum'': "They pretend that they have in their camps Cynocephali, that is, men with dogs' heads. They spread the rumor among the enemy that these men wage war obstinately, drink human blood and quaff their own gore if they cannot reach the foe."&lt;ref&gt;''simulant se in castris suis habere cynocephalos, id est canini capitis homines. Divulgant apud hostes, hos pertinaciter bella gerere, humanum sanguinem bibere et, si hostem adsequi non possint, proprium potare cruorum''. Paul the Deacon, ''Historia gentis Langobardorum'' Book 1, ch. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; At the court of [[Charlemagne]] the [[Norsemen|Norse]] were given this attribution, implying un-Christian and less-than-human qualities: "I am greatly saddened" said the King of the Franks, in [[Notker the Stammerer|Notker]]'s ''Life'', "that I have not been thought worthy to let my Christian hand sport with these dog-heads."&lt;ref&gt;Notker, ''Life of Charlemagne'', Book II §3.&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth-century Frankish theologian [[Ratramnus]] wrote a letter, the ''Epistola de Cynocephalis'', on whether the Cynocephali should be considered human (he thought that they were).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' 121: 1153–56.&lt;/ref&gt; If human, a Christian's duty would be to preach the Gospels to them. If animals, and thus without souls, such would be pointless. Quoting St. Jerome, [[Thomas of Cantimpré]] corroborated the existence of Cynocephali in his ''Liber de Monstruosis Hominibus Orientis'', xiv, ("Book of Monstrous men of the [[Orient]]"). The thirteenth-century encyclopedist [[Vincent of Beauvais]] acquainted his patron Saint [[Louis IX of France]] with "an animal with the head of the dog but with all other members of human appearance… Though he behaves like a man… and, when peaceful, he is tender like a man, when furious, he becomes cruel and retaliates on humankind".&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, ''Speculum naturale'', 31:126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nowell Codex]], perhaps more commonly known as the manuscript containing the Anglo-Saxon epic [[Beowulf]], also contains references to Cynocephali. One such reference can be found in the part of the manuscript known as The Wonders of the East, in which they are called "healfhundingas" or "half-dogs."  Also, in [[Anglo-Saxon England]], the Old English word ''wulfes heafod'' ("wolf's head") was a technical term for an [[outlaw]], who could be killed as if he were a wolf. The so-called ''[[Leges Edwardi Confessoris]]'', written around 1140, however, offered a somewhat literal interpretation: “[6.2a] For from the day of his outlawry he bears a wolf's head, which is called ''wluesheued'' by the English. [6.2b] And this sentence is the same for all outlaws.”&lt;ref&gt;''lupinum enim caput geret a die utlagacionis sue, quod ab Anglis 'uuluesheued' '' [= Old English ''wulfes heafod'' 'wolf's head'] ''nominatur. Et haec sententia communis est de omnibus utlagis''. ''Leges Edwardi Confessoris'' § 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Cynocephali appear in the [[Old Welsh]] poem ''[[Pa gur|Pa Gur?]]'' as ''cinbin'' (dogheads). Here they are enemies of [[King Arthur]]'s retinue; Arthur's men fight them in the mountains of ''[[Edinburgh|Eidyn]]'' (Edinburgh), and hundreds of them fall at the hand of Arthur's warrior [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]] (later known as Bedivere).&lt;ref name="Green 84-85"&gt;Green, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; The next lines of the poem also mention a fight with a character named Garwlwyd (Rough-Gray); a [[Gwrgi Garwlwyd]] (Man-Dog Rough-Gray) appears in one of the [[Welsh Triads]], where he is described in such a way that scholars have discussed him as a [[werewolf]].&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, p. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and late medieval travel literature===
Medieval travellers [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]] and [[Marco Polo]] both mention cynocephali. Giovanni writes of the armies of [[Ogedei Khan]] who encounter a race of dogheads who live north of the Dalai-Nor (Northern Ocean), or [[Lake Baikal]].&lt;ref&gt;John of Plano Carpini, ''The long and wonderful voyage of Frier Iohn de Plano Carpini'', Chapters 11 and 15&lt;/ref&gt; Polo's ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'' mentions the dog-headed barbarians on the island of Angamanain, or the [[Andaman Islands]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistorylo00hulmuoft|title=Natural history, lore and legend; being some few examples of quaint and by-gone beliefs, gathered in from divers authorities, ancient and mediaeval, of varying degrees of reliability|last=Hulme|first=F.

According to [[Henri Cordier]], the source of all the fables of the dog-headed barbarians, whether European, Arabic, or Chinese, can be found in the [[Alexander Romance]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Cordier's 'Notes and Addenda' in the Sir Henry Yule edition of ''The Travels of Marco Polo, Volume 2''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central and East Asia a common calendar system consists of a twelve year cycle, with each year represented as an animal. The eleventh animal of the twelve year cycle is the dog. Often such animals are depicted as human figures with an animal head. Thus, the cynocephalic depiction of the eleventh zodiac animal is common (possibly with a tail).

Additionally, in the [[China|Chinese]] record ''History of the [[Liang Dynasty]]'' (''[[Book of Liang|Liang Shu]]''), the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] missionary Huisheng (慧生) describes an island of dog-headed men to the east of [[Fusang]], a nation he visited variously identified as [[Japan]] or the [[Americas]]. The ''[[History of Northern Dynasties]]'' of Li Yanshou (李延寿), a [[Tang dynasty]] historian, also mentions the 'dog kingdom'.

==Modern appearances==
The use of dog-headed, human-bodied characters is still very strong in modern literature. In the domain of [[comics]] publishing in North America and in Europe many works feature an "all-cynocephalic" cast or use the heads of dogs and other animals together for social comment or other purposes.
* In the [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning graphic novel ''[[Maus]]'' by [[Art Spiegelman]], [[Jews]] have human bodies and the heads of mice while characters with their roots in the United States have human bodies and the heads of dogs, Germans have the heads of cats, and the French have the heads of frogs.
* The comic book ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' features a villain named Doghead. He is an [[anthropomorphic]] dog who serves [[Blackheart]], the son of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], a demon lord falsely claiming to be The Devil. 
* The hero of ''[[Baudolino]]'', a novel by [[Umberto Eco]], has to face dog-headed people at the end of his journey.
* Dog-headed creatures based on the ancient accounts appear in many modern [[role-playing game]]s, such as ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.
* A fearsome race of dog-faced warriors appear in [[Terry Jones]]' book ''[[Erik the Viking]]''.
* The title character in Scott Adams' cartoon ''Dilbert'' once dated a dog-headed woman, described as "fetching".

==Other dog-headed creatures in legend==

* The Chinese legend of [[Fuxi]] included variations where he had a dog's head, or he and his sister [[Nüwa]] had ugly faces.
* In the United States there are tales of dog-headed creatures, including the [[Michigan Dogman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Beast of Bray Road: Tailing Wisconsin's Werewolf |last=Godfrey |first=Linda S. |year=2003 |publisher=Big Earth Publishing |isbn=1-879483-91-2 |pages=58–61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_Po8ixCCqUC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=michigan+dogman&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QLS3TMvYGMyanAfUmtCRCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=michigan%20dogman&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the wolf-like [[Beast of Bray Road]] of [[Wisconsin]].

The '''Cypress of Keshmar''' is a mythical [[Cupressus|cypress]] tree of legendary beauty and gargantuan dimensions.

It is said to have sprung from a branch brought by [[Zoroaster]] from Paradise and to have stood in today's [[Razavi Khorasan Province]] in northeastern Iran and to have been planted by Zoroaster in honor of the conversion of King [[Vishtaspa]] to [[Zoroastrianism]]. According to the Iranian physicist and historian [[Zakariya Qazvini]], King [[Vishtaspa]] had been a patron of Zoroaster who planted the tree himself. In his cosmology, he further describes how the [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[Al-Mutawakkil]] in 247 AH (861 AD) caused the mighty cypress to be felled, and then transported it across Iran, to be used for beams in his new palace at [[Samarra]]. Before, he wanted the tree to be reconstructed before his eyes. This was done in spite of protests by the Iranians, who offered a very high sum of money to save the tree. Mutawakkil never saw the cypress, because he was murdered by a Turkish soldier (possibly in the employ of his son) on the night when it arrived on the banks of the Tigris.

The '''Erawan Shrine''', formally the '''Thao Maha Phrom Shrine''' ({{lang-th|ศาลท้าวมหาพรหม}}; {{Rtgs|''San Thao Maha Phrom''}}; "Shrine of Lord Brahma the Great"), is a [[shrine]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], that houses a statue of [[Phra Phrom]], the Thai representation of the Hindu god of creation Lord [[Brahma]]. A popular worship attraction, it often features performances by resident [[Thai dance]] troupes, who are hired by worshippers in return for seeing their prayers at the shrine answered.

On 17 August 2015, [[2015 Ratchaprasong bombing|a bomb exploded]] near the shrine, killing 20 and injuring 125 more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/658808/city-bomb-horror |title=Bangkok bomb horror: At least 20 die, 125 hurt in Erawan shrine blast |newspaper=[[Bangkok Post]] |date=18 August 2015 |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The shrine is by the Grand [[Hyatt]] Erawan Hotel, at the [[Ratchaprasong]] intersection of [[Ratchadamri Road]] in [[Pathum Wan]] district. It is near the [[Bangkok Skytrain]]'s Chitlom Station, which has an elevated walkway overlooking the shrine. The area has many shopping malls nearby, including Gaysorn, [[CentralWorld]] and Amarin Plaza.

Five other shrines dedicated to Hindu deities are located in the area as well: Phra Laksami ([[Lakshmi]]), Phra Trimurati ([[Trimurti]]), Phra Khanet ([[Ganesha]]), Phra In ([[Indra]]), and Phra Narai Song Suban ([[Narayana]] on his [[garuda]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tour-bangkok-legacies.com/lakshmi-shrine.html |first=Eric |last=Lim |title=Lakshmi Shrine – guardian angel of Ratchaprasong |work=Tour Bangkok Legacies |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thailandsworld.com/en/bangkok/bangkok-temples/hindu-shrines-at-ratchaprasong-bangkok/index.cfm |title=Thailand's World: Hindu Shrines at Ratchaprasong |work=thailandsworld.com |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifes-indulgences.blogspot.ch/2007/11/hindu-shrines-around-bangkok.html |title=Life's Indulgences |author=Shirls |work=lifes-indulgences.blogspot.ch |date=16 November 2007 |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Erawan Shrine was built in 1956 as part of the government-owned Erawan Hotel to eliminate the bad karma believed caused by laying the foundations on the wrong date.

The hotel's construction was delayed by a series of mishaps, including cost overruns, injuries to laborers, and the loss of a shipload of Italian marble intended for the building. Furthermore, the Ratchaprasong intersection had once been used to put criminals on public display.

An [[astrologer]] advised building the shrine to counter the negative influences. The Brahma statue was designed and built by the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]] and enshrined on 9 November 1956. The hotel's construction thereafter proceeded without further incident.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news |last=McGirk |first=Jan |date=22 March 2006 |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article352759.ece |title=Attack on Thai statue seen as bad omen for beleaguered Thaksin |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=4 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102230511/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article352759.ece |archivedate=2 January 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the hotel was demolished and the site used for the Grand Hyatt Erawan Hotel.&lt;ref name="2Bangkok"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2bangkok.com/2bangkok/buildings/erawan/erawan.shtml |title=A visit to the old Erawan Hotel |work=2Bangkok.com |accessdate=4 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113011749/http://2bangkok.com/2bangkok/buildings/erawan/erawan.shtml |archivedate=13 January 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006 vandalism ===
In the early hours of 21 March 2006, the shrine was vandalised by a [[Thai people|Thai]] man who destroyed the statue with a hammer. The vandal, 27-year-old Thanakorn Pakdeepol, was then beaten to death by angry bystanders. Two street sweepers who worked for the [[Pathum Wan District]] office were arrested and charged{{update-inline|date=March 2018}}&lt;!-- were they convicted? --&gt; with the fatal beating.&lt;ref name = "Revered"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/21/headlines/headlines_20003221.php |title=Much-revered Phra Prom statue destroyed |work=[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]] |date=21 March 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2018}}

Witnesses said Thanakorn stood on the base of the statue with a large hammer in his hands, and smashed the hollow statue of [[Brahma]] to pieces. The deity's four-faced head, torso, six arms and weapons were fragmented. Only part of the lap and base of the statue were left intact. The incident occurred at about 01:00.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

During the autopsy of Thanakorn Pakdeepol, doctors found Arabic characters tattooed on his back and arms, prompting police to investigate if the attack had a religious motive and if the vandal or his family had ties to Muslim extremists.&lt;ref name = "AP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/world/20060322-0253-thailand-shrinedestroyed.html |title=Police probing whether attacker of sacred shrine in Thailand was Muslim extremist |first=Sutin |last=Wannabovorn |newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=22 March 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vandal's father, Sayant Pakdeepol, said his son had received treatment for psychiatric problems and that mental illness was the cause of the attack. Sayant described the fatal beating of his son as an "overreaction". "Doing something like this is not the act of people with good beliefs, of those with real faith in Brahma", Sayyant told ''[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]'' newspaper. "Murder is an immoral act and people with morality would not have done what they did".&lt;ref name = "Dad"&gt;{{cite news |title=Vandal's dad distraught |newspaper=[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]] |page=4A |date=23 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days immediately after the destruction of the Erawan Shrine, then [[List of Prime Ministers of Thailand|Thai Prime Minister]] [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] visited and paid his respects to the broken fragments of the Hindu deity. A white cloth was used to conceal the absence of the statue. Officials later reopened the site to the public, displaying photographs of the statue so worshippers could pay their respects.&lt;ref name="Revered"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Man beaten"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/22/headlines/headlines_20003314.php |title=Man beaten to death after desecrating the Erawan Shrine |first=Monthathip |last=Poo |work=The Nation |date=22 March 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820161638/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/22/headlines/headlines_20003314.php |archivedate=20 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an anti-Thaksin rally on the following day, government critic [[Sondhi Limthongkul]] charged the destruction of the statue was a plot by the admittedly superstitious Thaksin to maintain his political power through [[black magic]]. However, Thanakorn's father rejected the claim, telling ''The Nation'' that Sondhi "is the biggest liar I have ever seen." When asked to comment the accusation, Thaksin simply replied, "That's insane."&lt;ref name="Dad"/&gt;

A new Brahma statue was placed in the shrine on 21 May 2006 at 11:39, the moment the sun was directly above the shrine. Officials with the Religious Affairs Department and the Maha Brahma Foundation said it was made of plaster, mixed with a mixture of gold, bronze and other precious metals, along with fragments of the original statue. Another duplicate statue, made entirely of metal, was cast in the same mold, and is kept in the national museum.&lt;ref name="Restored"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/22/headlines/headlines_30004585.php |title=Erawan Shrine statue restored |first=Chatrarat |last=Kaewmorakot |work=The Nation |date=22 May 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612170340/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/22/headlines/headlines_30004585.php |archivedate=12 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1484">The title '''gonagas''' (or '''konagas'''), bird man, was a [[shaman]] ranking level in Northern [[Scandinavia]] amongst [[noaydde]]s, which possessed special level of spiritual knowledge and visualized themselves to have possession to transform oneself into a bird figure to "fly" over mountains. Because of this spiritual ability, [[Nicolaus Lundius Lappo|Lundius]] states they were treated more respectfully or had a higher position than other peoples. According to the myth they could "spiritual communicate," i.e. travel to trading ports in forehand and see what peoples would come to trade. And in the [[witchcraft]]ing period, the figure could not be burned on the stake because the fire would be smothered in the same way water cannot be ignited.

The word ultimately derives from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word for "[[Monarch|king]]" (Compare to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''Kuningas'' and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''Kunigas'', both from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*Kuningaz''; in archaic contex the Finnish word simply had the meaning of "[[leader]]" or "high-ranked person" instead of monarch).

'''Hannes Olof Gösta Alfvén''' ({{IPA-sv|alˈveːn|lang}}; 30 May 1908 – 2 April 1995) was a Swedish [[electrical engineer]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] physicist and winner of the 1970 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD).  He described the class of MHD waves now known as [[Alfvén wave]]s. He was originally trained as an electrical power engineer and later moved to research and teaching in the fields of plasma physics and electrical engineering.  Alfvén made many contributions to plasma physics, including theories describing the behavior of [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]e, the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, the effect of [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storms]] on the [[Earth's magnetic field]], the terrestrial [[magnetosphere]], and the dynamics of plasmas in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

== Education ==

Alfvén received his PhD from the [[University of Uppsala]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="Who Was Who"&gt;{{cite book|title=Who Was Who in America, 1993-1996, vol. 11|date=1996|publisher=Marquis Who's Who|location=New Providence, N.J.|isbn=0-8379-0225-8|page=4|chapter=Alfvén, Hannes Olof Gosta}}&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis was titled "Investigations of High-frequency Electromagnetic Waves."

== Early years ==

In 1934, Alfvén taught [[physics]] at both the [[University of Uppsala]] and the Nobel Institute for Physics (later renamed the [[Manne Siegbahn]] Institute of Physics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.msl.se/MSL_files/history.htm |accessdate=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. In 1940, he became professor of electromagnetic theory and electrical measurements at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm. In 1945, he acquired the nonappointive position of Chair of Electronics. His title was changed to Chair of Plasma Physics in 1963. From 1954 to 1955, Alfvén was a Fulbright Scholar at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. In 1967, after leaving Sweden and spending time in the [[Soviet Union]], he moved to the United States. Alfvén worked in the departments of [[electrical engineering]] at both the [[University of California, San Diego]] and the [[University of Southern California]].

== Later years ==
In 1991, Alfvén retired as professor of electrical engineering at the [[University of California, San Diego]] and professor of [[plasma physics]] at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm.

Alfvén spent his later adult life alternating between [[California]] and Sweden. He died at the age of 86.

== Research ==
In 1937, Alfvén argued that if [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] pervaded the universe, it could then carry electric currents capable of generating a galactic magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Alfvén, 1937 "Cosmic Radiation as an Intra-galactic Phenomenon", ''Ark. f. mat., astr. o. fys.'' 25B, no. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the Nobel Prize for his works in [[magnetohydrodynamics]], he emphasized that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to understand the phenomena in a certain plasma region, it is necessary to map not only the magnetic but also the electric field and the electric currents. Space is filled with a network of currents which transfer energy and momentum over large or very large distances. The currents often pinch to filamentary or surface currents. The latter are likely to give space, as also interstellar and intergalactic space, a cellular structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Hannes | first = A | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1990ITPS...18....5A&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c32555 | title = Cosmology in the Plasma Universe: An Introductory Exposition | date =1990 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science | issn =  0093-3813 | volume = 18  | pages = 5–10|bibcode = 1990ITPS...18....5P |doi = 10.1109/27.45495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His theoretical work on field-aligned electric currents in the aurora (based on earlier work by [[Kristian Birkeland]]) was confirmed in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of spiral galaxies |authors=Peratt, A. L., Peter, W., &amp; Snell, C. M. |conference=Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields |booktitle=Proceedings of the 140th Symposium of IAU |location=Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany |date=June 19–23, 1989 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |pages=143–150 |bibcode=1990IAUS..140..143P |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1990IAUS..140..143P/0000149.000.html |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; these currents now being known as [[Birkeland current]]s.

Alfvén's work was disputed for many years by the senior scientist in space physics, the British [[mathematician]] and [[Geophysics|geophysicist]] [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Chapman and J. Bartels, ‘’Geomagnetism," Vol. 1 and 2, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfvén's disagreements with Chapman stemmed in large part from trouble with the [[peer review]] system. Alfvén rarely benefited from the acceptance generally afforded senior scientists in [[scientific journal]]s. He once submitted a paper on the theory of [[magnetic storm]]s and [[Auroral light|aurora]]s to the American journal ''[[Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity]]'' only to have his paper rejected on the ground that it did not agree with the theoretical calculations of conventional physics of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hannes Alfvén (1908-1995) |url=http://public.lanl.gov/alp/plasma/people/alfven.html |accessdate=22 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222214748/http://public.lanl.gov/alp/plasma/people/alfven.html |archivedate=22 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was regarded as a person with [[Fringe science|unorthodox opinion]]s in the field by many physicists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = DJ |author2=Hersen M  | pages = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0471520683&amp;id=sw9QeD–bvJgC&amp;pg=PA10 10] | title = Research Fraud in the Behavioral and Biomedical Sciences | date = 1992| isbn = 0471520683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; R. H. Stuewer noting that "... he remained an embittered outsider, winning little respect from other scientists even after he received the Nobel Prize..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = RH | last = Stuewer  | url = http://www.springerlink.com/link.asp?id=qg36424630186274 | title = Book Reviews | date = 2006 | journal = Physics in Perspective | volume =  8 | issue = 1| pages = 104–112|bibcode = 2006PhP.....8..104S |doi = 10.1007/s00016-005-0251-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was often forced to publish his papers in obscure journals. Alfvén recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I describe [plasma phenomena] according to this formalism most referees do not understand what I say and turn down my papers. With the referee system which rules US science today, this means that my papers are rarely accepted by the leading US journals.&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Alfvén, "Memoirs of a Dissident Scientist", ''American Scientist'', Volume 76, No 3, May–June 1988, pp. 249–251. Quoted in Joseph Paul Martino, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdQBSffyTTwC&amp;pg=PA131 Science Funding: Politics and Porkbarrel]'' 1992, Transaction Publishers, {{ISBN|1-56000-033-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alfvén played a central role in the development of:

* [[Plasma physics]]
* [[Charged particle beam]]s
* [[Interplanetary medium]]
* [[Magnetospheric physics]]
* [[Magnetohydrodynamics]]
* [[:Category:Solar phenomena|Solar phenomena]] investigation (such as the [[solar wind]])
* [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurorae science]]

In 1939, Alfvén proposed the theory of [[geomagnetic storm|magnetic storm]]s and auroras and the theory of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma dynamics]] in the [[earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]]. This was the paper rejected by the U.S. journal ''Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity''.

Applications of Alfvén's research in space science include:

* [[Van Allen radiation belt]] theory
* Reduction of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] during [[magnetic storm]]s
* [[Magnetosphere]] (protective plasma covering the earth)
* Formation of [[comet]] tails
* Formation of the [[solar system]]
* [[Astrophysical plasma|Dynamics of plasmas in the galaxy]]
* [[Physical cosmology]]

Alfvén's views followed those of the founder of magnetospheric physics, [[Kristian Birkeland]]. At the end of the nineteenth century, Birkeland proposed (backed by extensive data) that electric currents flowing down along the Earth's magnetic fields into the atmosphere caused the aurora and polar magnetic disturbances.

Areas of technology benefiting from Alfvén's contributions include:

* [[Particle accelerator]]s
* Controlled [[thermonuclear fusion]]
* [[Hypersonic flight]]
* [[Rocket]] propulsion
* [[Atmospheric reentry|Reentry]] braking of [[space vehicle]]s

Contributions to astrophysics:

* Galactic magnetic field (1937)
* Identified nonthermal [[synchrotron radiation]] from astronomical sources (1950)

[[Alfvén wave]]s (low [[frequency]] hydromagnetic [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[oscillator|oscillations]]) are named in his honor. Many of his theories about the solar system were verified as late as the 1980s through external measurements of cometary and planetary magnetospheres. But Alfvén himself noted that astrophysical textbooks poorly represented known plasma phenomena: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;A study of how a number of the most used textbooks in astrophysics treat important concepts such as [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]], [[critical ionization velocity|critical velocity]], [[pinch effect]]s, and circuits is made. It is found that students using these textbooks remain essentially ignorant of even the existence of these concepts, despite the fact that some of them have been well known for half a century (e.g, double layers, Langmuir, 1929; pinch effect, Bennet, 1934).&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Alfvén, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986ITPS...14..779A&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c02197 Double layers and circuits in astrophysics]" (1986) ''IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science'' (ISSN 0093-3813), vol. PS-14, Dec. 1986, p. 779-793.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alfvén reported that of 17 of the most used textbooks on astrophysics, none mention the pinch effect, none mentioned critical ionization velocity, only two mentioned circuits, and three mentioned double layers.

Alfvén believed the problem with the [[Big Bang]] was that astrophysicists tried to extrapolate the origin of the universe from [[mathematical theory|mathematical theories]] developed on the blackboard, rather than starting from known observable phenomena. He also considered the Big Bang to be a [[mythology|myth]] devised to explain creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hannes |last=Alfvén |title=Cosmology—Myth or Science? |journal=J Astrophysics and Astronomy |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=79–98 |year=1984 |doi=10.1007/BF02714974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfvén and colleagues proposed the [[Alfvén–Klein cosmology|Alfvén–Klein model]] as an alternative [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] theory to both the [[Big Bang]] and [[steady state theory]] cosmologies.

== Personal life ==
Alfvén had a good sense of [[humor]], and he participated in a variety of social issues and worldwide disarmament movements. He had a long-standing distrust of [[computer]]s. Alfvén studied the [[history of science]], [[oriental philosophy]], and [[religion]]. On his religious views, Alfven was [[irreligious]] and critical of religion.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuclear power is uniquely unforgiving: as Swedish Nobel physicist Hannes Alfvén said, "No acts of God can be permitted."" Amory Lovins, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/insidenova/author/amory-lovins/ Inside NOVA - Nuclear After Japan: Amory Lovins], ''pbs.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Matter and Spirit in the Universe: Scientific and Religious Preludes to Modern Cosmology|date=2004|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=9781860944697|page=252|author=Helge Kragh|quote=Alfven dismissed in his address religion as a "myth," and passionately criticized the big-bang theory for being dogmatic and violating basic standards of science, to be no less mythical than religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke Swedish, English, German, French, and Russian, and some Spanish and Chinese. He expressed great concern about the difficulties of permanent [[high-level radioactive waste management]]."&lt;ref name="radioactive1979"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abbotts, John|date=October 1979|title=Radioactive waste: A technical solution?|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists| pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfvén was also interested in problems in cosmology and all aspects of auroral physics, and used Schröder's well known book on aurora, ''Das Phänomen des Polarlichts''.&lt;ref&gt;Schröder, Wilfried . 2000. The Aurora in time. (Das Phänomen des Polarlichts). Darmstadt: Reproduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Letters of Alfvén, Treder, and Schröder were published on the occasion of Treder's 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Schröder, Wilfried, and  Hans Jürgen Treder. 1998. ''From Newton to Einstein: A festschrift in honour of the 70th birthday of Hans-Jürgen Treder''. Bremen: Rönnebeck; Arbeitskreis Geschichte der Geophysik in der Deutschen Geophysikalischen Gesellschaft.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schröder, Wilfried, and  Hans Jürgen Treder. 1993. ''The earth and the universe: A festschrift in honour of Hans-Jürgen Treder''. Bremen-Rönnebeck: Science Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationships between Hans-Jürgen Treder, Hannes Alfvén and Wilfried Schröder were discussed in detail by Schröder in his publications.

Alfvén was married for 67 years to his wife Kerstin (1910–1992). They raised five children, one boy and four girls. His son became a physician, while one daughter became a writer and another a lawyer in Sweden. The composer [[Hugo Alfvén]] was Hannes Alfvén's uncle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4076">'''Honouring the Ancient Dead''' (HAD) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] advocacy group working within Britain for the dignified treatment of human remains of British pagan provenance.  It explores the issues of excavation, storage, museum display, disposal, repatriation and reburial.  In particular questioning the idea of who has assumed authority over human remains, its core remit is dialogue and consultation between all relevant bodies when decisions are made about the remains of the ancient dead.   
 
The organization was founded by [[Emma Restall Orr]], during the May 2004 negotiations regarding roads around [[Stonehenge]].

Where British remains are concerned, it is difficult to prove direct ancestry, nor is there coherence of religious belief through time connecting the ancient dead with the living. However, Honouring the Ancient Dead is challenging museums, curators and scientists to consider the British dead in a new light and to treat all remains with respect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/ma/8125 Museums Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The debate over human remains ranges widely with the needs of science, specific cultures, and the bones themselves under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1531&amp;Itemid=47 Current Archaeology - Human remains: retain or return?]&lt;/ref&gt; HAD works successfully in cooperation with museums such as The [[Manchester Museum]] (with whom it ran a conference in 2006), Leicester Museums, the [[Museum of London]] and many others, and has been developing sound relations with the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and [[English Heritage]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
 
Current government guidelines regarding human remains are sympathetic to genealogical descendants, the cultural community of origin, and the Country of Origin. They require some proof of cultural, spiritual and religious significance of the remains.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Claims are unlikely to be successful for any remains over 300 years old, and are unlikely to be considered for remains over 500 years old, except where a very close and continuous geographical, religious, spiritual and cultural link can be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalpropertyadvice.gov.uk/assets/userfiles/index.php?file=000212.pdf Cultural Property Advice]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Indigenous music of North America}}
'''Indigenous music of North America''', which includes '''American Indian music''' or '''Native American music''', is the 
[[music]] that is used, created or performed by [[Indigenous peoples of North America]], including [[Native Americans in the United States]] and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]], [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico]], and other [[North America]]n countries—especially traditional [[tribe (American Indian)|tribal]] music, such as [[Pueblo music]] and [[Inuit music]]. In addition to the traditional music of the Native American groups, there now exist [[pan-Indianism|pan-tribal]] and intertribal [[genre (music)|genres]] as well as distinct Native American [[subgenre]]s of [[popular music]] including: [[rock and roll|rock]], [[blues]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[classical music|classical]], [[film music]], and [[reggae]], as well as unique popular styles like [[chicken scratch]] and [[New Mexico music]].

[[Singing]] and [[percussion]] are the most important aspects of traditional Native American music. Vocalization takes many forms, ranging from solo and choral song to responsorial, unison and multipart singing. Percussion, especially drums and rattles, are common accompaniment to keep the rhythm steady for the singers, who generally use their native language or non-lexical [[vocable]]s (nonsense syllables). Traditional music usually begins with slow and steady beats that grow gradually faster and more emphatic, while various flourishes like drum and rattle [[tremolo]]s, shouts and accented patterns add variety and signal changes in performance for [[singer]]s and [[dancer]]s.&lt;ref name="Overview367-368"&gt;Heth, Charlotte, "Overview" in ''[[The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music]]'', pp. 367–368&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Song texts and sources ===
Native American song texts include both public pieces and secret songs, said to be "ancient and unchanging", which are used for only sacred and ceremonial purposes. There are also public sacred songs, as well as ritual speeches that are sometimes perceived as musical because of their use of rhythm and melody. These ritual speeches often directly describe the events of a ceremony, and the reasons and ramifications of the night.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, pp. 368–370&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vocable]]s, or lexically meaningless syllables, are a common part of many kinds of Native American songs. They frequently mark the beginning and end of phrases, sections or songs themselves. Often songs make frequent use of vocables and other untranslatable elements. Songs that are translatable include historical songs, like the Navajo "[[Shi' naasha']], which celebrates the end of Navajo internment in [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico]] in 1868. Tribal flag songs and national anthems are also a major part of the Native American musical corpus, and are a frequent starter to public ceremonies, especially [[powwow]]s. Native American music also includes a range of [[courtship]] songs, dancing songs and popular American or Canadian tunes like "[[Amazing Grace]], "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]", "[[Jambalaya (song)|Jambalaya]]" and "[[Sugar Time]]". Many songs celebrate harvest, planting season or other important times of year.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, pg. 368-369&lt;/ref&gt;

== Societal role ==

Native American music plays a vital role in history and education, with ceremonies and stories orally passing on ancestral customs to new generations. Native American ceremonial music is traditionally said to originate from deities or spirits, or from particularly respected individuals. Rituals are shaped by every aspect of song, dance and costuming, and each aspect informs about the "makers, wearers and symbols important to the nation, tribe, village, clan, family, or individual".&lt;ref&gt;Overview 367–368&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans perform stories through song, music and dance, and the historical facts thus propagated are an integral part of Native American beliefs. Epic legends and stories about culture heroes are a part of tribal music traditions, and these tales are often an iconic part of local culture.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; They can vary slightly from year to year, with leaders recombining and introducing slight variations. The [[Pueblo]] compose a number of new songs each year in a committee which uses dreams and visions.&lt;ref&gt;Herndon, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

The styles and purposes of music vary greatly between and among each Native American tribe. However, a common concept amongst many indigenous groups is a conflation of music and power. For example, the [[Pima people|Pima]] people feel many of their songs were given in the beginning and sung by the Creator. It was believed that some people then have more of an inclination to musical talent than others because of an individual's peculiar power.&lt;ref&gt;Herndon 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
[[File:SE turtle shackles 1920s OHS.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Southeast women's turtleshell leg rattles, ca. 1920, collection of the [[Oklahoma History Center]]]]
Within various Native American communities, gender plays an important role in music. Men and women play sex-specific roles in many musical activities. Instruments, songs and dances are often peculiar to one or the other sex, and many musical settings are strictly controlled by sex. In modern powwows, women play a vital role as backup singers and dancers.&lt;ref name="Gender"&gt;Heth, "Overview" in the ''Garland Encyclopaedia of World Music'', pp. 370–372&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cherokee]] people, for example, hold dances before [[Stickball (Native American)|stickball]] games. At these pre-game events, men and women perform separate dances and follow separate regulations. Men will dance in a circle around a fire, while women dance in place. Men sing their own songs, while women have their songs sung for them by an [[American Indian elder|elder]]. Whereas the men's songs invoke power, the women's songs draw power away from the opposing stickball team.&lt;ref name="Herndon124"&gt;Herndon, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; In some societies, there are customs where certain ceremonial drums are to be played by men only. For the Southern Plains Indians, it is believed that the first drum was given to a woman by the Great Spirit, who instructed her to share it with all women of native nations. However, there also exist prohibitions against women sitting at the Beg Drum.&lt;ref name="Herndon124"/&gt;

Many tribal music cultures have a relative paucity of traditional women's songs and dances, especially in the Northeast and Southeast regions. The Southeast is, however, home to a prominent women's musical tradition in the use of leg rattles for ceremonial [[stomp dance|stomp]] and friendship dances, and the women's singing during [[Horse and Ball Game]] contests. The West Coast tribes of North America tend to more prominence in women's music, with special women's [[love song]]s, [[medicine song]]s and [[handgame]] songs; the Southwest is particularly diverse in women's musical offerings, with major ceremonial, instrumental and social roles in dances. Women also play a vital ceremonial role in the [[Sun Dance]] of the Great Plains and Great Basin, and sing during social dances. [[Shoshone]] women still sang the songs of the [[Ghost Dance]] into the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gender"/&gt;

== History ==
Music and [[oral history|history]] are tightly interwoven in Native American life. A tribe's history is constantly told and retold through music, which keeps alive an oral narrative of history. These historical narratives vary widely from tribe to tribe and are an integral part of tribal identity. However, their historical authenticity cannot be verified; aside from supposition and some archaeological evidence, the earliest documentation of Native American music came with the arrival of European explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 3 Crawford refers to the "historical knowledge valuable to a Native musician" as falling "more readily into the category of myth than of fact".&lt;/ref&gt; Musical instruments and pictographs depicting music and dance have been dated as far back as the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, Charlotte, "Overview" in ''The Garland Encyclopaedia of World Music'', p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruno Nettl refers to the style of the Great Basin area as the oldest style and common throughout the entire continent before [[Mesoamerica]] but continued in only the Great Basin and in the lullaby, gambling, and tale genres around the continent. A style featuring relaxed vocal technique and the rise may have originated in Mesoamerican Mexico and spread northward, particularly into the California-Yuman and Eastern music areas. According to Nettl, these styles also feature "relative" rhythmic simplicity in drumming and percussion, with isometric material and pentatonic scales in the singing, and motives created from shorter sections into longer ones.&lt;ref name="Nettl56118118"&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

While this process occurred, three Asian styles may have influenced North American music across the Bering Strait, all featuring pulsating vocal technique and possibly evident in recent Paleo-Siberian tribes such as Chuckchee, Yukaghir, Koryak. Also, these may have influenced the Plains-Pueblo, Athabascan, and Inuit-Northwest Coast areas. According to Nettl, the boundary between these southward and the above northward influences are the areas of greatest musical complexity: the Northwest Coast, Pueblo music, and Navajo music. Evidence of influences between the Northwest Coast and Mexico are indicated, for example, by bird-shaped whistles.&lt;ref name="Nettl56118118"/&gt; The Plains-Pueblo area has influenced and continues to influence the surrounding cultures, with contemporary musicians of all tribes learning Plains-Pueblo-influenced pantribal genres such as Peyote songs.&lt;ref name="Nettl56118118"/&gt;

== Music areas ==
{{see also|First Nations music}}
Nettl uses the following music areas which approximately coincide with Wissler, Kroeber, and Driver's [[cultural area]]s: Inuit-Northwest coast, Great Basin, California-Yuman, Plains-Pueblo, Athabascan, and Eastern.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, p.107-116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apachefiddler.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Chasi, a [[Warm Springs Apache]] musician playing the Apache fiddle, 1886, photo by A. Frank Randall&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siarchives&amp;uri=full=3100001~!33821~!0#focus "Portrait of Chasi, Bonito's Son..."] ''National Anthropological Archives.'' (retrieved 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Native Americans of the [[Southwestern United States]] were limited to [[idiophone]]s and [[aerophone]]s as mediums to sound production beginning date in the seventh century. The applicable idiophones included: plank resonators, [[footed drum]]s, [[percussion stone]]s, [[shaken idiophone]]s, [[vessel rattle]]s, and copper and clay [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. The applicable aerophones included [[bullroarer]]s, decomposable [[whistle]]s and [[flute]]s, clay resonator whistles, [[shell trumpet]]s and prehistoric [[reed instrument]]s. The wood flute was of particular significance. 

Arid [[American Southwest]] is home to two broad groupings of closely related cultures, the [[Pueblo]] and [[Athabaskan]]. The Southern Athabaskan [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] and [[Apache]] tribes sing in Plains-style [[Nasalization|nasal vocals]] with unblended monophony, while the Pueblos emphasize a relaxed, low range and highly blended monophonic style. Athabaskan songs are swift and use drums or [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s, as well as an instrument unique to this area, the [[Apache fiddle]], or "Tsii'edo'a'tl" meaning "wood that sings" in the [[Apache language]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Pueblo songs are complex and meticulously detailed, usually with five sections divided into four or more phrases characterized by detailed introductory and cadential formulas. They are much slower in tempo than Athabaskan songs, and use various [[percussion instrument]]s as accompaniment.
[[File:PiuteGamblingSong.ogg|left|thumb|Piute Game Song intended to accompany the action of the game being played.]]
Nettl describes Pueblo music, including [[Hopi]], [[Zuni people|Zuni]], [[Taos Pueblo]], [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]], [[Santo Domingo Pueblo]], and many others, as one of the most complex on the continent, featuring increased length and number of scale tones ([[hexatonic scale|hexatonic]] and [[heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] common), variety of form, melodic contour, and percussive accompaniment, ranges between an octave and a twelfth, with rhythmic complexity equal to the Plains sub-area. He sites the [[Kachina]] dance songs as the most complex songs and Hopi and Zuni material as the most complex of the Pueblo, while [[Tanoan languages|Tanoan]] and [[Keres language|Keresan]] music is simpler and intermediate between the Plains and western Pueblos. The music of the [[Pima people|Pima]] and [[Tohono O'odham]] is intermediary between the Plains-Pueblo and the California-Yuman music areas, with melodic movement of the Yuman, though including the [[Melodic motion|rise]], and the form and rhythm of the Pueblo.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956112114"&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp. 112–114&lt;/ref&gt;

He describes Southern Athabascan music, that of the Apache and Navajo, as the simplest next to the Great Basin style, featuring [[strophic form]], tense vocals using [[pulse (music)|pulsation]] and [[falsetto]], [[tritonic scale|tritonic]] and [[tetratonic scale|tetratonic]] scales in [[triad (music)|triad]] formation, simple rhythms and values of limited duration (usually only two per song), arc-type melodic contours, and large melodic intervals with a predominance of [[major third|major]] and [[minor third|minor thirds]] and [[perfect fourth|perfect fourths]] and [[perfect fifth|fifths]] with [[octave]] leaps not rare. [[Peyote song]]s share characteristics of Apache music and Plains-Pueblo music having been promoted among the Plains by the Apache people.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956112114"/&gt;

He describes the structural characteristics of California-Yuman music, including that of Pomo, Miwak, Luiseno, Catalineno, and Gabrielino, and the Yuman tribes, including, Mohave, Yuman, Havasupai, Maricopa, as using the rise in almost all songs, a relaxed nonpulsating vocal technique (like European classical music), a relatively large amount of isorhythmic material, some isorhythmic tendencies, simple rhythms, pentatonic scales without semitones, an average melodic range of an octave, [[sequence (music)|sequence]], and [[syncopation|syncopated]] figures such as a sixteenth-note, eight-note, sixteenth-note figure. The form of rise used varies throughout the area, usually being rhythmically related to the preceding non-rise section but differing in melodic material or pitch. The rise may be no higher than the highest pitch of the original section, but will contain a much larger number of higher pitches. In California the non-rise is usually one reiterate phrase, the rise being the phrase transposed an octave higher, the Yumans use a non-rise of long repeated sections each consisting of several phrases, the rise being three to five phrases performed only once, and in southern California the previous two and progressive forms are found.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp.109–110&lt;/ref&gt; A distinctively Californian instrument is the [[clapper stick]], a percussion instrument made by splitting an elderberry branch used to accompany singers and dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keeling |first1=Richard |title=Music and Culture Areas of Native California |journal=Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology |date=1992 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=6-7, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Woodlands===
[[File:Cwy turtleshell rattle.jpg|thumb|360px|Men's turtleshell rattle, made by [[Tommy Wildcat]] ([[Cherokee]]-[[Muscogee (Creek)|Muscogee]]-[[Natchez Nation|Natchez]]]]
Inhabiting a wide swath of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands]], according to Nettl, can be distinguished by [[antiphon]]y ([[call and response (music)|call and response]] style singing), which does not occur in other areas. Their territory includes [[Maritime Canada]], [[New England]], [[Mid-Atlantic States|U.S. Mid-Atlantic]], [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] and [[United States Southeast|Southeast]] regions. Songs are rhythmically complex, characterized by frequent metric changes and a close relationship to [[ritual dance]]. Flutes and whistles are solo instruments, and a wide variety of drums, rattles and striking sticks are played. Nettl describes the Eastern music area as the region between the [[Mississippi river]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. The most complex styles are that of the Southeastern Creek, [[Yuchi]], Cherokee, [[Choctaw]], [[Iroquois]] and their language group, with the simpler style being that of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language group including [[Lenape|Delaware]] and [[Penobscot]]. The Algonquian-speaking [[Shawnee]] have a relatively complex style influenced by the nearby southeastern tribes.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956114115"&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp.114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this entire area include short iterative phrases; reverting relationships; shouts before, during, and after singing [[Anhemitonic scale|anhemitonic pentatonic scales]]; simple rhythms and meter and, according to Nettl, antiphonal or responsorial techniques including "rudimentary imitative [[polyphony]]". Melodic movement tends to be gradually descending throughout the area and vocals include a moderate amount of tension and pulsation.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956114115"/&gt;

===Plains===
&lt;!--[[Plains Indian music]] redirects directly here--&gt;
Extending across the [[American Midwest]] into Canada, [[Great Plains|Plains]]-area music is [[Nasalization|nasal]], with high pitches and frequent [[falsetto]]s, with a [[terraced descent]] (a step-by-step descent down an [[octave]]) in an unblended [[monophony]]. [[Strophe]]s use [[incomplete repetition]], meaning that songs are divided into two parts, the second of which is always repeated before returning to the beginning.

Large double-sided skin drums are characteristic of the Plains tribes, and solo [[end-blown flute]]s (flageolet) are also common.

Nettl describes the central [[Plains Indians]], from Canada to Texas: Blackfoot, Crow, Dakota, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and Comanche, as the most typical and simple sub-area of the Plains-Pueblo music area. This area's music is characterized by extreme vocal tension, pulsation, melodic preference for perfect fourths and a range averring a tenth, rhythmic complexity, and increased frequency of [[Musical scale|tetratonic scale]]s. The musics of the Arapaho and Cheyenne intensify these characteristics, while the northern tribes, especially [[Blackfoot music]], feature simpler material, smaller melodic ranges, and fewer scale tones.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Nettl [[Arapaho music]] includes ceremonial and secular songs, such as the ritualistic [[Sun Dance]], performed in the summer when the various bands of the Arapaho people would come together. Arapaho traditional songs consist of two sections exhibiting terraced descent, with a range greater than an octave and scales between four and six tones. Other ceremonial songs were received in visions, or taught as part of a man's initiations into a society for his age group. Secular songs include a number of social dances, such as the triple meter [[round dance]]s and songs to inspire warriors or recent exploits. There are also songs said to be taught by a guardian spirit, which should be sung only when the recipient is near death.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1965, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Basin===
Music of the [[Great Basin]] is simple, discreet and ornate, characterized by short melodies with a range smaller than an [[octave]], moderately-blended [[monophony]], relaxed and open vocals and, most unusually, paired-phrase structure, in which a melodic [[phrase (music theory)|phrase]], repeated twice, is alternated with one to two additional phrases. A song of this type might be diagrammed as follows: AA BB CC AA BB CC, etc.

Nettl describes the music of the sparsely settled Great Basin, including most of desert Utah and Nevada (Paiute, Ute, Shoshoni) and some of southern Oregon (Modoc and Klamath), as "extremely simple," featuring melodic ranges averaging just over a perfect fifth, many tetratonic scales, and short forms. The majority of songs are iterative with each phrase repeated once, though occasional songs with multiple repetitions are found. Many Modoc and Klamath songs contain only one repeated phrase and many of their scales only two to three notes (ditonic or tritonic). This style was carried to the Great Plains by the [[Ghost Dance religion]] which originated among the Paiute, and very frequently features paired-phrase patterns and a relaxed nonpulsating vocal style. Herzog attributes the similarly simple lullabies, song-stories, and gambling songs found all over the continent historically to the music of the Great Basin which was preserved through relative cultural isolation and low population.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, p. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northwest Coast===
Open vocals with [[monophony]] are common in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[British Columbia]], though [[polyphony]] also occurs (this is the only area of North America with native polyphony). Chromatic intervals accompanying long melodies are also characteristic, and rhythms are complex and declamatory, deriving from speech. Instrumentation is more diverse than in the rest of North America, and includes a wide variety of whistles, flutes, horns and percussion instruments.

Nettl describes the music of the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]], [[Tsimshian]], [[Makah people|Makah]], and Quileute as some of the most complex on the continent, with the music of the Salish nations ([[Nlaka'pamux]], [[Nuxalk Nation|Nuxálk]], and [[Sliammon]], and others directly east of the Northwest tribes) as being intermediary between these Northwest Coast tribes and Inuit music. The music of the Salish tribes, and even more so the Northwest coast, intensifies the significant features of Inuit music, see below, however their melodic movement is often pendulum-type ("leaping in broad intervals from one limit of the range to the other"). The Northwest coast music also "is among the most complicated on the continent, especially in regard to rhythmic structure," featuring intricate rhythmic patterns distinct from but related to the vocal melody and rigid percussion. He also reports unrecorded use of incipient polyphony in the form of drones or parallel intervals in addition to antiphonal and responorial forms. Vocals are extremely tense, producing dynamic contrast, ornamentation, and pulsation, and also often using multiple sudden accents in one held tone.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956108108"&gt;Nettl, 1956, p. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arctic===
[[File:Inupiat drummers at Eskimo dance.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Inupiaq]] drummers in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]]]]
{{main|Inuit music}}
The [[Inuit]] of [[Alaska]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Yukon Territory]], [[Nunavut]] and [[Greenland]] are well known for their [[Inuit throat singing|throat-singing]], an unusual method of vocalizing found only in a few cultures worldwide. Throat-singing is used as the basis for a game among the Inuit. Narrow-ranged melodies and declamatory effects are common, as in the Northwest. Repeated notes mark the ends of phrases. [[Box drums]], which are found elsewhere, are common, as is a [[tambourine]]-like [[hand drum]]. Nettl describes "Eskimo" music as some of the simplest on the continent, listing characteristics including recitative-like singing, complex rhythmic organization, relatively small melodic range averaging about a sixth, prominence of major thirds and minor seconds melodically, with undulating melodic movement.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956108108"/&gt;

==Academic study==
Archaeological evidence of Native American music dates as far back as the 7th century. However, the earliest written documentation comes from the arrival of European explorers on the American continent, and the earliest academic research comes from the late 19th century. During that period, early musicologists and folklorists collected and studied Native American music, and propounded theories about indigenous styles. In the early 20th century, more systematic research began led by comparative musicologists like [[Frances Densmore]], [[Natalie Curtis]], [[George Herzog (ethnomusicologist)|George Herzog]] and [[Helen Heffron Roberts]]. Densmore was the most prolific of the era, publishing more than one hundred works on Native American music. Most recently, since the 1950s, Native American music has been a part of ethnomusicological research, studied by [[Bruno Nettl]], [[William Powers (ethnomusicologist)|William Powers]] and [[David P. McAllester|David McAllester]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, Charlotte, "Overview" in ''The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music'', pg. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intertribal music==
[[File:Wake singers oglala.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Wake Singers, band of Oglala Lakota musicians]]
Many music genres span multiple tribes. Pan-tribalism is the syncretic adoption of traditions from foreign communities. Since the rise of the United States and Canada, Native Americans have forged a common identity, and invented pan-Indian music, most famously including [[powwow]]s, [[peyote song]]s, and the [[Ghost Dance]].

The Ghost Dance spread throughout the Plains tribes in the 1890s and many songs are sung today. They are characterized by relaxed vocals and a narrow range. [[Apache Tribe|Apache]]-derived peyote songs, [[prayer]]s in the [[Native American Church]], use a descending melody and monophony. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s and [[water drum]]s are used, in a swift tempo. The [[Sun Dance]] and [[Grass Dance]] of the plains are the roots of intertribal powwows, which feature music with [[terraced descent]] and nasal vocals, both Plains characteristic features.

An example of an intertribal song is the [[AIM Song]], which uses meaningless [[vocables]] to make it accessible to people of all tribes. However, because of its origins from the Lakota and Ojibwe people, it still retains some Northern Plains and Great Lakes characteristics.

[[John Trudell]] ([[Santee Dakota]]) launched a new genre of [[spoken word]] poetry in the 1980s, beginning with ''[[Aka Graffiti Man]]'' (1986). The next decade saw further innovations in Native American popular music, including [[Robbie Robertson]] (of [[The Band]]) releasing a [[soundtrack]] for a [[documentary film|documentary]], ''[[Music for the Native Americans]]'', that saw limited mainstream success, as well as [[Verdell Primeaux]] and [[Johnny Mike]]'s modernized [[peyote song]]s, which they began experimenting with on ''[[Sacred Path: Healing Songs of the Native American Church]]''.

Waila (or chicken scratch music of the [[Tohono O'odham]]) has gained performers like the [[Joaquin Brothers]] fame across Native American communities, while [[hip hop music|hip hop]] crews like [[WithOut Rezervation]] and [[Robby Bee &amp; the Boyz From the Rez]] (''[[Reservation of Education]]'') have a distinctively Native American flourish to hip hop. In the 21st century the leading light of contemporary Native American music has been [[Martha Redbone]] whose award winning albums ''[[Home of the Brave (2002)]]'' and ''[[Skintalk (2005)]]'' have incorporated both traditional song and culture references into a brew of soul, funk, rock and jazz that has reached audiences across Europe and Japan as well as into the urban communities of the US. Meanwhile, young Native musicians such as [[Red Earth (band)|Red Earth]] (see [["Zia Soul" (2003)]] ), [[DJ Abel]], [[Derek Miller]], [[Ethnic DeGeneration]], [[War Water]], and [[DJ Casper|Casper]] are producing outstanding underground music (ranging from hip-hop to funk to reggae to metal) defying stereotypes of Native people (without label support).

[[American Indian opera]] is an intertribal music tradition, created when [[Gertrude Bonnin]], a [[Yankton Dakota]] activist collaborated with a classical composer William Hanson to create the opera, ''Sun Dance'' in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kstrom.net/isk/stories/authors/bonnin.html "Gertrude Bonnin, Zitkala Sha, Yankton Nakota."] ''Native Authors.'' (retrieved 12 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cherokee Nation]] [[mezzo-soprano]] opera singer, [[Barbara McAlister (opera singer)|Barbara McAlister]] has performed in many opera troupes and has sung at New York's [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160811134726/http://www.cnec-edu.org/McAlister_Barbara.php "CAiR- Cherokee Artist in Residency: Barbara McAlister."] ''Cherokee Nation Education Corporation.''

===Native American flute===
[[File:Yuchiflute.png|thumb|350px|A traditional [[Yuchi]] flute.&lt;ref&gt;Speck, Frank G. ''Ethnology of the Yuchi Indians.'' Philadelphia: University Museum, 1909. p. 154. Pl. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Native American flute}}
The Native American flute has achieved some measure of fame for its distinctive sound, used in a variety of [[New-age music|new age]] and [[world music]] recordings. Its music was used in [[courtship]], [[healing]], meditation, and spiritual rituals.

The late 1960s saw a [[roots revival]] centered around the flute, with a new wave of flautists and artisans like [[Doc Tate Nevaquaya]] ([[Comanche]]) and [[Carl Running Deer]]. Notable and award winning Native American flautists include: [[Mary Youngblood]], [[Kevin Locke (musician)|Kevin Locke]], [[Charles Littleleaf]], [[Jay Red Eagle]], [[Robert Tree Cody]], [[Robert Mirabal]], [[Joseph Firecrow]], and [[Jeff Ball (musician)|Jeff Ball]]. [[Tommy Wildcat]] is a contemporary flutist, who makes traditional Cherokee [[river cane]] flutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powersource.com/gallery/wildcat/default.htm Tommy Wildcat.] ''Powersource.'' 1997 (retrieved 28 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Of special importance is [[R. Carlos Nakai]] (''[[Changes (R. Carlos Nakai album)|Changes]]'', 1983), who has achieved Gold record status and mainstream credibility for his mixture of the flute with other contemporary genres.

The Native American flute is the only flute in the world constructed with two air chambers - there is a wall inside the flute between the top (slow) air chamber and the bottom chamber which has the whistle and finger holes. The top chamber also serves as a secondary resonator, which gives the flute its distinctive sound. There is a hole at the bottom of the "slow" air chamber and a (generally) square hole at the top of the playing chamber. A block (or "bird") with a spacer is tied on top of the flute to form a thin, flat airstream for the whistle hole (or "window"). Some more modern flutes use an undercut either in the block or the flute to eliminate the need for a spacer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Flutopedia.com/anatomy.htm ''Anatomy of the Native American Flute'', Clint Goss]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "traditional" Native American flute was constructed using measurements based on the body - the length of the flute would be the distance from armpit to wrist, the length of the top air chamber would be one fist-width, the distance from the whistle to the first hole also a fist-width, the distance between holes would be one thumb-width, and the distance from the last hole to the end would generally be one fist-width. Unlike Western music, traditional American Indian music had no standard pitch reference such as [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]], so flutes were not standardized for pitch.

Historic Native American flutes are generally tuned to a variation of the minor pentatonic scale (such as you would get playing the black keys on a piano), which gives the instrument its distinctive plaintive sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flutopedia.com/scale_PentatonicMinor.htm ''NAF Scale: Pentatonic Minor'', Clint Goss]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently some makers have begun experimenting with different scales, giving players new melodic options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flutopedia.com/scales.htm ''NAF Scales for the Native American Flute'', Clint Goss]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, modern flutes are generally tuned in concert keys (such as A or D) so that they can be easily played with other instruments. The root keys of modern Native American flutes span a range of about three and a half octaves, from C2 to A5.

Native American flutes most commonly have either 5 or 6 holes, but instruments can have anything from no holes to seven (including a thumb hole). Various makers employ different scales and fingerings for their flutes.

Some modern Native American flutes are called "drone" flutes, and are two (or more) flutes built together. Generally, the drone chamber plays a fixed note which the other flute can play against in harmony.

===Drums===
[[File:MIM PHX 2011-04-26 0197 edited.jpg|thumb|Drum and drumsticks at rest]]
Drums are highly influential in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums and how to play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.

Another type of drum called a [[foot drum]] have been found in several southwestern and central-Californian Native American archaeological sites inhabited, or formally inhabited, by the [[Miwok]], [[Maidu]], [[Nahua people|Nahua]], and [[Hopi]] Indian tribes. These drums were often semicircle cross-sectioned hollow logs laid over wood covered 'resonating' pits positioned according to custom in [[kivas]] or dance houses. The foot drums were played by stomping on top of the hollow log with the structure's poles used for steadying.

===Awards===
The dedicated [[Native American Music Awards]], which successfully proposed the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album, was launched in 1998 and continues to be held annually. The Native American Music Awards or N.A.M.A. was the first national awards program for Native American music in North America. The awards were born out of a need for greater recognition for Native American music initiatives and remains the largest professional membership based organization in the world.

From 2001 to 2011, the American [[Grammy Awards]] presented an annual award for [[Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album|Best Native American Music Album]], and the Canadian [[Juno Awards]] present an annual award for [[Juno Award for Aboriginal Recording of the Year|Aboriginal Recording of the Year]]. On April 6, 2011, it was announced that the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album would be merged with the [[Grammy Award for Best Hawaiian Music Album|Best Hawaiian Music Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album|Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album]] categories into a new category, [[Best Regional Roots Music Album]]. This change was part of a massive restructuring of Grammy categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement|title=GRAMMY Awards Category Restructuring|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AQXlzopI?url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement|archivedate=2012-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/explanation-for-category-restructuring|title=Explanation for Category Restructuring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samples==
*[[Media:Bice'waan Song.ogg]] is a recording from the [[Library of Congress]], collected by Alice Cunningham Fletcher and Francis La Flesche and published in 1897. The singer is George Miller, who was probably born in about 1852. It was described as: "The true love-song, called by the Omaha Bethae waan, an old designation and not a descriptive name, is sung generally in the early morning, when the lover is keeping his tryst and watching for the maiden to emerge from the tent and go to the spring. They belong to the secret courtship and are sometimes called Me-the-g'thun wa-an - courting songs. . . . They were sung without drum, bell or rattle, to accent the rhythm, in which these songs is subordinated to tonality and is felt only in the musical phrases. . . . Vibrations for the purpose of giving greater expression were not only affected by the tremolo of the voice, but they were enhanced by waving the hand, or a spray of artemesia before the lips, while the body often swayed gently to the rhythm of the song (Fletcher, 1894, p.&amp;nbsp;156)."
*[[Media:PiuteGamblingSong.ogg|Download recording]] [[Ghost Dance]] and [[gambling]] song from the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] and [[Arapaho]] Native Americans from the Library of Congress' ''Emile Berliner and the Birth of the Recording Industry Collection''; performed by James Mooney (possibly along with Charles Mooney; neither are believed to be [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]) on July 5, 1894

{{Islam in Iran}}
The [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] (637&amp;ndash;651) led to the end of the [[Sasanian Empire]] and the eventual decline of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] religion in [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. However, the achievements of the previous Persian civilizations were not lost, but were to a great extent absorbed by the new Islamic polity. Islam has been the official religion of [[Iran]] since then, except for a short duration after the [[Mongol]] raids and establishment of [[Ilkhanate]]. Iran became an [[Islamic republic]] after the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] of 1979.

Before the Islamic conquest, the Persians had been mainly [[Zoroastrian]]; however, there were also large and thriving [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]] communities, especially in the territories of at that time northwestern, western, and southern Iran, mainly [[Caucasian Albania]], [[Asōristān]], [[Persian Armenia]], and [[Caucasian Iberia]]. Eastern Sassanian Iran, what is now solely composed of Afghanistan and [[Central Asia]], was predominantly [[Buddhist]]. There was a slow but steady movement of the population toward [[Islam]]. When Islam was introduced to Iranians, the nobility and city-dwellers were the first to convert, Islam spread more slowly among the peasantry and the ''[[dehqan]]s'', or landed gentry. By the late 11th century, the majority of Persians had become Muslim, at least nominally.

Islam is the religion of 99.4% of Iranians. Nearly 90% of Iranians are [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] and about 10% are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]. Most Sunnis in Iran are [[Kurds]], [[Lari people (Iran)|Larestani people]] (from [[Larestan]]), [[Turkmens|Turkomen]], and [[Baluch people|Baluch]]s, living in the northwest, northeast, south, and southeast.&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt; Almost all of Iranian Shi'as are [[Twelvers]].

Though Iran is known today as a stronghold of the Shi'a Muslim faith, it did not become so until much later, around the 15th century. The [[Safavid]] dynasty made Shi'a Islam the official state religion in the early sixteenth century and aggressively proselytized on its behalf. It is also believed that by the mid-seventeenth century most people in Iran and the territory of the contemporary neighboring [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]] had become Shi'as,&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8IKR0oqdRkC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=safavid+persia+conversion&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=201#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=The Caspian: politics, energy and security, By Shirin Akiner, pg.158|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an affiliation that has continued. Over the following centuries, with the state-fostered rise of a Persian-based Shi'ite clergy, a synthesis was formed between Persian culture and Shi'ite Islam that marked each indelibly with the tincture of the other.

Muslims invaded Iran in the time of [[Umar]] (637) and conquered it after several great battles. [[Yazdegerd III]] fled from one district to another [[Merv]] in 651.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://p2.www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=106324&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=9106324 | title=Iran | publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 674, Muslims had conquered [[Greater Khorasan]] (which included modern Iranian Khorasan province and modern [[Afghanistan]], [[Transoxania]]).

As [[Bernard Lewis]] has quoted&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html |title=Iran in history |first=Bernard |last=Lewis |publisher=[[Tel Aviv University]] |accessdate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429144545/http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html |archivedate=2007-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"These events have been variously seen in Iran: by some as a blessing, the advent of the true faith, the end of the age of ignorance and heathenism; by others as a humiliating national defeat, the conquest and subjugation of the country by foreign invaders. Both perceptions are of course valid, depending on one's angle of vision."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under [[Umar]] and his immediate successors, the Arab conquerors attempted to maintain their political and cultural cohesion despite the attractions of the civilizations they had conquered. The Arabs were to settle in the garrison towns rather than on scattered estates.  The new non-Muslim subjects, or ''[[dhimmi]]'', were to pay a special tax, the ''[[jizya]]'' or poll tax, which was calculated per individual at varying rates for able bodied men of military age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Iranians were among the very earliest converts to Islam, and their conversion in significant numbers began as soon as the Arab armies reached and overran the Persian plateau. Despite some resistance from elements of the Zoroastrian clergy and other ancient religions, the anti-Islamic policies of later conquerors like the Il-khanids, the impact of the Christian and secular West in modern times, and the attraction of new religious movements like Babism and the Bahai faith (qq.v.), the vast majority of Iranians became and have remained Muslims. Today perhaps 98 percent of ethnic Iranians, including the population of Persia, are at least nominal Muslims. For such a fundamental, pervasive, and enduring cultural transformation, the phenomenon of Iranian conversions to Islam has received remarkably little scholarly attention (for an early and still worthwhile survey of the subject, see Arnold, pp.&amp;nbsp;209–20; for significant recent advances, see Bulliet, 1979a; idem, 1979b).

Recent research has established a general chronological framework for the process of conversion of Iranians to Islam. From a study of the probable dates of individual conversions based on genealogies in biographical dictionaries, Richard Bulliet has suggested that there was gradual and limited conversion of Persians down to the end of the Umayyad period (132/750), followed by a rapid increase in the number of conversions after the ʿAbbasid revolution, so that by the time when regional dynasties had been established in the east (ca. 338/950) 80 percent or more of Iranians had become Muslims. The data on which Bulliet’s study was based limited the validity of this paradigm to generalizations about full, formal conversions in an urban environment. The situation in rural areas and individual regions may have been quite different, but the overall pattern is consistent with what can be deduced from traditional historical sources. Although in some areas, for example, Shiraz at the time of Moqaddasi’s visit in about 375/985 (p.&amp;nbsp;429), there may still have been strong non-Muslim elements, it is reasonable to suppose that the Persian milieu as a whole became predominantly Islamic within the period of time suggested by Bulliet’s research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/conversion-ii|title=CONVERSION ii.

===Islamization of Iran===
{{See also|Islamization of Iran}}

Following the [[Abbasid]] revolution of 749-51, in which Iranian converts played a major role, the Caliphate's center of gravity moved to Mesopotamia and underwent significant Iranian influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Foltz |authorlink=Richard Foltz |title=Religions of Iran: From Prehistory to the Present |publisher=Oneworld publications |location=London |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-78074-308-0 | pages=169–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the Muslim population of Iran rose from approx. 40% in the mid 9th century to close to 100% by the end of 11th century.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt; Islam was readily accepted by [[Zoroastrians]] who were employed in industrial and artisan positions because, according to Zoroastrian dogma, such occupations that involved defiling fire made them impure.&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir [[Thomas Walker Arnold]], pg.170-180&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[dawah|Muslim missionaries]] did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenets to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to [[Thomas Walker Arnold]], for the Persian, he would meet [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Ahriman]] under the names of [[Allah]] and [[Iblis]].&lt;ref name ="Arnold" /&gt; [[Muslim]] leaders in their effort to win converts encouraged attendance at Muslim prayer, and allowed the [[Quran]] to be recited in Persian instead of Arabic so that it would be intelligible to all.&lt;ref name ="Arnold" /&gt; The first complete translation of the [[Qur'an]] into [[Persian language|Persian]] occurred during the reign of [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]] in the 9th century. [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers.&lt;ref name="Tobin"&gt;Tobin 113-115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Hossein, ''Islam and the Plight of Modern Man''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bernard Lewis]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran reemerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as [[Islam-i Ajam]]. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429144545/http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html |archivedate=2007-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Iran and the Islamic culture and civilization===
[[Image:Ghotb2.jpg|thumb|right|Photo taken from medieval manuscript by [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi|Qotbeddin Shirazi]] (1236–1311), a Persian Astronomer. The image depicts an epicyclic planetary model.]]

The [[Islamization of Iran]] was to yield deep transformations within the cultural, scientific, and political structure of Iran's society: The blossoming of [[Persian literature]], [[Iranian philosophy|philosophy]], [[Science and technology in Iran|medicine]] and [[Persian art|art]] became major elements of the newly forming Muslim civilization. Inheriting a heritage of thousands of years of civilization, and being at the "crossroads of the major cultural highways",&lt;ref&gt;Caheb C., Cambridge History of Iran, ''Tribes, Cities and Social Organization'', vol. 4, p305–328&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to Persia emerging as what culminated into the "[[Islamic Golden Age]]". During this period, [[List of Iranian scientists and scholars|hundreds of scholars and scientists]] vastly contributed to technology, science and medicine, later influencing the rise of European science during [[the Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kühnel E., in ''Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesell'', Vol. CVI (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important scholars of almost all of the Islamic sects and schools of thought were Persian or live in Iran including most notable and reliable [[Hadith]] collectors of [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] like [[Shaikh Saduq]], [[Mohammad Ya'qub Kulainy|Shaikh Kulainy]], [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Imam Bukhari]], [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Imam Muslim]] and [[Hakim al-Nishaburi]], the greatest [[Kalam|theologians]] of Shia and Sunni like [[Shaykh Tusi]], [[Al-Ghazali|Imam Ghazali]], [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi|Imam Fakhr al-Razi]] and [[Al-Zamakhshari]], the greatest [[physicians]], [[Islamic astronomy|astronomers]], [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logicians]], [[Islamic mathematics|mathematicians]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysicians]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophers]] and  [[Islamic science|scientists]] like [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī]], the greatest [[Shaykh of Sufism]] like [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]].

[[Ibn Khaldun]] narrates in his [[Muqaddimah]]:&lt;ref&gt;Translated by F. Rosenthal (III, pp. 311-15, 271-4 [Arabic]; R.N. Frye (p.91)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''It is a remarkable fact that, with few exceptions, most Muslim scholars… in the intellectual sciences have been non-Arabs, thus the founders of grammar were [[Sibawaih]] and after him, [[al-Farsi]] and Az-[[Zajjaj]]. All of them were of [[Persian people|Persian]] descent... they invented rules of [[Arabic grammar|(Arabic) grammar]]. Great jurists were Persians. Only the Persians engaged in the task of preserving knowledge and writing systematic scholarly works. Thus the truth of the [[Hadith|statement]] of the prophet ([[Muhammad]]) becomes apparent, "[[q:Persians|If learning were suspended in the highest parts of heaven the Persians would attain it]]"… The intellectual sciences were also the preserve of the Persians, left alone by the [[Arabs]], who did not cultivate them… as was the case with all crafts… This situation continued in the cities as long as the Persians and [[Persian World|Persian countries]], [[Iraq]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]] (modern Central Asia), retained their sedentary culture.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Shu'ubiyya movement===
{{See also|Shu'ubiyya}}
In the 9th and 10th centuries, non-Arab subjects of the [[Ummah]], especially Persians created a movement called [[Shu'ubiyyah]] in response to the privileged status of Arabs. This movement led to resurgence of [[Persia]]n national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Enderwitz, S. "Shu'ubiyya". ''Encyclopedia of Islam''. Vol. IX (1997), pp. 513-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Persians adopted Islam, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as [[Persianization]]. Arabs and Turks also participated in this attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Frye, The Heritage of Persia, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayhanat al- adab, (3rd ed.), vol. 1, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], ''"Seljuq"'', Online Edition, ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9066688 LINK])&lt;/ref&gt;

As the power of the Abbasid caliphs diminished, a series of dynasties rose in various parts of Iran, some with considerable influence and power. Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the [[Tahirids]] in [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (820-72); the [[Saffarids]] in [[Sistan]] (867-903); and the [[Samanids]] (875-1005), originally at [[Bokhara]]. The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Islamic Conquest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/islamic_conquest/islamic_conquest.php|title=History of Iran: Islamic Conquest|author=|date=|website=www.iranchamber.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Persian faction known as the [[Buwayhid dynasty]] (934-1055). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian anyway, the Buwayhid, who were [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[Shia]], were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad.

The [[Samanid dynasty]] was the first fully native dynasty to rule Iran since the Muslim conquest, and led the revival of Persian culture. The first important Persian poet after the arrival of Islam, [[Rudaki]], was born during this era and was praised by Samanid kings. The Samanids also revived many ancient Persian festivals.  Their successor, the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznawids]], who were of non-Iranian Turkic origin, also became instrumental in the revival of Persian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/samanids/samanids.php|title=History of Iran: Samanid Dynasty|author=|date=|website=www.iranchamber.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunni Sultanates===
In 962 a Turkish governor of the Samanids, [[Alptigin]], conquered [[Ghazna]] (in present-day Afghanistan) and established a dynasty, the [[Ghaznavids]], that lasted to 1186.&lt;ref name="Islamic Conquest"/&gt; Later, the [[Seljuks]], who like the Ghaznavids were Turks, slowly conquered Iran over the course of the 11th century. Their leader, [[Tughril Beg]], turned his warriors against the Ghaznavids in Khorasan. He moved south and then west, conquering but not wasting the cities in his path. In 1055 the caliph in Baghdad gave Tughril Beg robes, gifts, and the title King of the East. Under Tughril Beg's successor, [[Malik Shah I|Malik Shah]] (1072&amp;ndash;1092), Iran enjoyed a cultural and scientific renaissance, largely attributed to his brilliant Iranian vizier, [[Nizam al Mulk]]. These leaders established the [[Isfahan Observatory]] where [[Omar Khayyám]] did much of his experimentation for a new calendar, and they built [[Nizamiyya|religious schools]] in all the major towns. They brought [[Abu Hamid Ghazali]], one of the greatest Islamic theologians, and other eminent scholars to the Seljuk capital at Baghdad and encouraged and supported their work.&lt;ref name="Islamic Conquest"/&gt;

A serious internal threat to the Seljuks during their reign came from the [[Hashshashin]]- [[Ismailis]] of the [[Nizari]] sect, with headquarters at [[Alamut]] between [[Rasht]] and [[Tehran]]. They controlled the immediate area for more than 150 years and sporadically sent out adherents to strengthen their rule by murdering important officials. Several of the various theories on the etymology of the word ''[[assassination|assassin]]'' derive from this group.&lt;ref name="Islamic Conquest"/&gt;

Another notable Sunni dynasty were the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]]. [[Timur]] was a [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] leader from the [[Eurasian Steppe]], who conquered and ruled in the tradition of [[Genghis Khan]]. Under the [[Timurid Empire]], the [[Turco-Persian tradition]] which began during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] period would continue. [[Ulugh Beg]], grandson of [[Timur]], built an [[Ulugh Beg Observatory|observatory]] of his own, and a [[Ulugh Beg Madrasa, Samarkand|grand madrassah]] at [[Samarkand]].

===Shi'ism in Iran before Safavids===
[[File:RezaShrine.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Imam Reza]]'' shrine, the holiest religious site in Iran, [[Mashhad]]]]
Although [[Shi'a]]s have lived in Iran since the earliest days of Islam, the writers of [[the Four Books]] of Shi'a [[ahadith]] were Iranians of the pre-Safavid era and there was one Shi'a dynasty in part of Iran during the tenth and eleventh centuries, according to [[Mortaza Motahhari]] the majority of Iranian scholars and masses remained Sunni till the time of the Safavids.&lt;ref name="Motahhari"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/iran/mutual.htm|title=Islam and Iran: A Historical Study of Mutual Services|author=|date=|website=Al-Islam.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterizes the religious history of Iran during this period. There were however some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the Zaydīs of [[Tabaristan]], the [[Buwayhid]], the rule of [[Öljeitü|Sultan Muhammad Khudabandah]] (r. Shawwal 703-Shawwal 716/1304-1316) and the [[Sarbedaran]]. Nevertheless, apart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, original [[Twelvers|Imami Shiism]] as well as [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydī Shiism]] had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, Shia in Iran were nourished from [[Kufa]]h, [[Baghdad]] and later from [[Najaf]] and [[Hillah]].&lt;ref name="Jafarian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mot/iraqishiism/|title=Four Centuries of Influence of Iraqi Shiism on Pre-Safavid Iran|author=|date=|website=Al-Islam.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during the first nine centuries there are four high points in the history of this linkage:
* First, the migration of a number of persons belonging to the tribe of the [[Ash'ari]] from Iraq to the city of Qum towards the end of the first/seventh century, which is the period of establishment of Imamī Shī‘ism in Iran.
* Second, the influence of the Shī‘ī tradition of Baghdad and Najaf on Iran during the fifth/eleventh and sixth/twelfth centuries.
* Third, the influence of the school of Hillah on Iran during the eighth/fourteenth century.
* Fourth, the influence of the Shī‘ism of [[Jabal Amel]] and [[Bahrain]] on Iran during the period of establishment of the Safavid rule.&lt;ref name="Jafarian"/&gt;

===Shi'ism and the Safavids===
{{see also|Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam}}
Due to their history being almost fully intertwined, Iran as well as Azerbaijan are both discussed here. Iran and Azerbaijan were predominantly Sunni until the 16th century. Changes in the religious make-up of nowadays both nations changed drastically from that time and on. In 1500 the Safavid [[Shah Ismail I]] undertook the conquering of Iran and Azerbaijan and commenced a policy of [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|forced conversion of Sunni Muslims]] to [[Shia Islam]]. Many Sunnis were murdered. When [[Shah Ismail I]] conquered [[Iraq]], [[Dagestan]], [[Eastern Anatolia]], and [[Armenia]] he similarly forcefully converted or murdered Sunni Muslims. The oppression and forced conversion of Sunnis would continue, mostly unabated, for the greater part of next two centuries until Iran as well as what is now [[Azerbaijan]] became predominantly Shi’ite countries.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt;

As in the case of the [[Rashidun|early caliphate]], Safavid rule had been based originally on both political and religious legitimacy, with the shah being both king and divine representative. With the later erosion of Safavid central political authority in the mid-17th century, the power of the Shia scholars in civil affairs such as judges, administrators, and court functionaries, began to grow, in a way unprecedented in Shi'ite history. Likewise, the ulama began to take a more active role in agitating against Sufism and other forms of popular religion, which remained strong in Iran, and in enforcing a more scholarly type of [[Shi'a Islam]] among the masses. The development of the [[ta'ziah]]—a passion play commemorating the martyrdom of [[Imam Husayn]] and his family — and [[Ziarat]] of the shrines and tombs of local Shi'ite leaders began during this period, largely at the prompting of the Shi'ite clergy.&lt;ref name="Afary"&gt;[http://p2.www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=106324&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=9106324 Iran] Janet Afary, Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Mortaza Motahhari]], the majority of Iranians turned to Shi'a Islam from the Safavid period onwards. Of course, it cannot be denied that Iran's environment was more favorable to the flourishing of the Shi'a Islam as compared to all other parts of the Muslim world. Shi'a Islam did not penetrate any land to the extent that it gradually could in Iran. With the passage of time, Iranians' readiness to practise Shi'a Islam grew day by day.
It was the Safavids who made Iran the spiritual bastion of Shi’ism against the onslaughts of shi'as' by orthodox Sunni Islam, and the repository of Persian cultural traditions and self-awareness of Iranianhood,&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand R., ''Islamic art and Architecture'', London (1999), p228 – {{ISBN|0-500-20305-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; acting as a bridge to modern Iran. According to Professor Roger Savory:&lt;ref&gt;R.M. Savory, "Rise of a Shi'i State in Iran and New Orientation in Islamic Thought and Culture" in UNESCO: History of Humanity, Volume 5: From the Sixteenth to the Eighteenth Century, London ; New York : Routledge ; Paris. pg 263.[http://www.unesco.org/culture/humanity/html_eng/volume5.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|In Number of ways the Safavids affected the development of the modern Iranian state:  first, they ensured the continuance of various ancient and traditional Persian institutions, and transmitted these in a strengthened, or more 'national', form; second, by imposing Ithna 'Ashari Shi'a Islam on Iran as the official religion of the Safavid state, they enhanced the power of [[Mujtahid#Qualifications of a mujtahid|mujtahids]]. The Safavids thus set in train a struggle for power between the urban and the crown that is to say, between the proponents of secular government and the proponents of a theocratic government;  third, they laid the foundation of alliance between the religious classes ('[[Ulama]]') and the [[bazaar]] which played an important role both in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] of 1905–1906, and again in the [[Islamic Revolution]] of 1979; fourth the policies introduced by Shah Abbas I conduced to a more centralized administrative system.}}

===Contemporary era: Challenges of modernity and rise of Islamism===
{{see also|Islam and modernity|History of Islamism in Iran}}
During the 20th century Iran underwent significant changes such as the 1906 Constitutional Revolution and the secularism of the Pahlavi dynasty.

According to scholar Roy Mottahedeh, one significant change to Islam in Iran during the first half of the 20th century was that the class of [[ulema]] lost its informality that allowed it to include everyone from the highly trained jurist to the "shopkeeper who spent one afternoon a week memorizing and transmitting a few traditions." Laws by Reza Shah that requiring military service and dress in European-style clothes for Iranians, gave talebeh and mullahs exemptions, but only if they passed specific examinations proving their learnedness, thus excluding less educated clerics.

In addition Islamic [[Madrasah]] schools became more like 'professional' schools, leaving broader education to secular government schools and sticking to Islamic learning.  "Ptolemaic astronomy, Aveicennian medicines, and the algebra of Omar Kahayyam" was dispensed with.&lt;ref&gt;Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet : Religion and Politics in Iran'', One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.232-4, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation of Islam==

===Demography===

[[Sunni]] Muslims constitute approximately 10% of the Iranian population. A majority of [[Achomi people (Iran)|Lari people]] (Persians), a part of [[Kurds]], virtually all [[Baloch people|Baluchi]]s and [[Turkmen people|Turkomans]], and a minority of [[Arab]]s and [[Azeris]] are Sunnis, as are small communities of [[Persian people|Persians]] in southern Iran and [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]].

The [[Larestan County|mountainous region of Larestan]] is mostly inhabited by indigenous Sunni Persians who did not convert to Shia Islam during the [[Safavids]] because the mountainous region of Larestan was too isolated. The majority of [[Lari people (Iran)|Lari people]] are Sunni Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0y1jeSqbHLwC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The History of Ancient Iran, Part 3, Volume 7|work=Richard Nelson Frye|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zHxsWspxGIIC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=laristan+sunni+fars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IFieUsa9NMqM7Aa-pYDoBQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=laristan%20sunni%20fars&amp;f=false|title=Islamic Desk Reference|work= E.

The people of Larestan speak the [[Lari language]], which is a [[southwestern Iranian language]] closely related to [[Old Persian]] (pre-Islamic Persian) and [[Luri language|Luri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0y1jeSqbHLwC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The History of Ancient Iran, Part 3, Volume 7|work=Richard Nelson Frye|pages=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shia clergy tend to view missionary work among Sunnis to convert them to Shi'a Islam as a worthwhile religious endeavor.&lt;ref name="country study:Iran,Sunni Muslims"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ir0079)|title=country study:Iran,Sunni Muslims|author=|date=|website=loc.gov|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those towns with mixed populations in the [[Persian Gulf]] region, and [[Sistan and Baluchistan]], tensions between Shi'as and Sunnis existed both before and after the Revolution. Religious tensions have been highest during major Shi'a observances, especially [[Moharram]].&lt;ref name="country study:Iran,Sunni Muslims"/&gt;

===Religious government===
{{see also|Islamic republic}}
Iran's government is unique in following the principle of ''velayat-e faqih'' or guardianship of the jurist, according to which 
government must be run in accordance with traditional Islamic ''[[sharia]]'', and for this to happen a leading Islamic jurist (''[[faqih]]'') must provide political "guardianship" (''wilayat'' or ''velayat'') over the people.
Following the Iranian Revolution, the 1979 [[Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran]] made the "guardian" the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/Government/constitution.html Iranian Government Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819052822/http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/Government/constitution.html |date=2013-08-19 }}, English Text&lt;/ref&gt; The author of ''Velayat-e faqih'' doctrine,  Ayatollah Khomeini, as the first [[Supreme Leader]] of the Islamic Republic.

The [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] mandates that the official religion of Iran is [[Shia Islam]] and the [[Twelvers|Twelver]] [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari school]], though it also mandates that other Islamic schools are to be accorded full respect, and their followers are free to act in accordance with their own jurisprudence in performing their religious rites and recognizes [[Zoroastrian]], [[Jewish]], and [[Christian]] [[Demographics of Iran|Iranians]] as religious minorities. As part of this mandate of allowing other practices, however, the Islamic Republic does not allow Sunni mosques in areas where Sunnis are not the demographic majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/DL17Ak03.html|title=Asia Times|author=|date=|website=www.atimes.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of the Islamic Republic of Iran are officially divided into four categories: Muslims, Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians.  This official division ignores other religious minorities in Iran, notably those of the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] faith. Bahá’ís are a "non-recognized" religious minority without any legal existence. They are classified as "unprotected infidels" by the authorities, and are subject to systematic discrimination on the basis of their beliefs.  Similarly, atheism is officially disallowed; one must declare oneself as a member of one of the four recognized faiths in order to avail oneself of many of the rights of citizenship.&lt;ref name="fdih1"&gt;{{cite web | date = 2003-08-01 | title = Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran | author = International Federation for Human Rights | publisher = fdih.org | accessdate = 2006-10-20 | url = http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious institutions===
Historically, the most important religious institution in Iran has been the mosque. In towns and cities, congregational prayers, as well as prayers and rites associated with religious observances and important phases in Muslim life, took place in mosques. Primarily an urban phenomenon, mosques did not exist in most Iranian villages. In the years preceding the Revolution, Iranian Shias generally attached diminishing significance to institutional religion, and by the 1970s there was little emphasis on mosque attendance, even for the Friday congregational prayers. During the Revolution, however, mosques in large cities played a prominent social role in organizing people
for large demonstrations. Since that time, the mosques have continued to play important political and social roles, in addition to their traditional religious functions.&lt;ref name=loc&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Iran.pdf {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, weekly mosque attendance rate in Iran has been very low compared to other Muslim countries.&lt;ref name="Tezcur"&gt;Gunes Murat Tezcur, Taghi Azadarmaki, and Bahar Mehri, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150301105100/http://www.luc.edu/faculty/gtezcur/files/TezcurCritique.pdf Religious Participation among Muslims: Iranian Exceptionalism]," Middle East Critique 15(3) (Fall 2006): 217-232.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, politicization of Friday prayers under the Islamic Republic has had the paradoxical consequence of discouraging religious people from attending Friday prayers. People who attend prayers tend to have more positive evaluation of the political system than people who do not attend.&lt;ref name="Tezcur"/&gt;{{rp|228–9}}

Another religious institution of major significance has been the hoseiniyeh, or Islamic center. Wealthy patrons financed construction of hoseiniyehs in urban areas to serve as sites for recitals and performances commemorating the martyrdom of Hussein, especially during the month of Moharram. In the  1970s, hoseiniyehs such as the Hoseiniyeh Irshad in Tehran became politicized as prominent clerical and lay preachers helped to lay the groundwork for the Revolution by referring to the symbolic deaths as martyrs of Hussein and the other imams in veiled but obvious criticism of Mohammad Reza Shah’s regime. Institutions providing religious education include madrassas, or seminaries, and maktabs, or primary schools run by the clergy. The madrassas historically were important settings for advanced training in Shia theology and jurisprudence. Each madrassa generally was associated with a noted Shia scholar who had attained the rank of ayatollah. Some older madrassas
functioned like religious universities at which several scholars taught diverse religious and secular subjects. Students, or talabehs, lived on the grounds of the madrassas and received stipends for the duration of their studies, usually a minimum of seven years, during which they prepared for the examinations that qualify a seminary student to be a low-level preacher, or mullah. At the time of the Revolution, there
were slightly more than 11,000 talabehs in Iran, approximately 60 percent of them at the madrassas in Qom. From 1979 to 1982, the number of talabehs in Qom more than tripled from 6,500. There were just under 25,000 talabehs at all levels of study in Qom seminaries in the early 2000s, as well as about 12,000 talabehs at seminaries in other Iranian cities.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

Maktabs started to decline in number and importance in the first decades of the twentieth century, once the government began developing a national public school system. Nevertheless, maktabs continued to exist as private religious schools until the Revolution. Because the overall emphasis of public schools has remained secular subjects, since 1979 maktabs have continued to serve children whose parents want them to have a more religious education.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

Another major religious institution in Iran is the shrine. Pilgrimage to the shrines of imams is a specific Shia custom, undertaken because Shia pilgrims believe that the imams and their relatives have the power to intercede with God on behalf of petitioners. Of the more than 1,100 shrines in Iran, the most important are those for the Eighth Imam, [[Ali al-Ridha]], in [[Mashhad]] and for his sister [[Fatimah bint Musa]] in [[Qom]], and for [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Seyyed Rouhollah Khomeini]] in Tehran. Each of these is a huge complex that includes the mausoleum of the venerated one, tombs of various notables, mosques, madrassas, and libraries. Imam Reza's shrine is considered the holiest. In addition to the usual shrine accoutrements, it comprises hospitals, dispensaries, a museum, and several mosques located in a series of courtyards surrounding the imam’s tomb. The shrine's endowments and gifts are the largest of all religious institutions in the country. Although there are no special times for visiting this or other shrines, it is customary for pilgrimage traffic to be heaviest during Shia holy periods. Visitors represent all socioeconomic levels. Whereas piety is a motivation for many, others come to seek the spiritual grace or general good fortune that a visit to the shrine is believed to ensure. Since the nineteenth century, it has been customary among the bazaar class and members of the lower classes to recognize those who have made a pilgrimage to Mashhad by prefixing their names with the title mashti. Shrine authorities have estimated that at least 4 million pilgrims visit the shrine annually in the early 2000s. There are also important secondary shrines for other relatives of the Eighth Imam in Tehran and Shiraz. In virtually all towns and in many villages, there are numerous lesser shrines, known as imamzadehs, that commemorate descendants of the imams who are reputed to have led saintly lives. In Iraq the shrines at Karbala and An Najaf also are revered by Iranian Shias. Pilgrimages to these shrines and the hundreds of local mamzadehs are undertaken to petition the saints to grant special favors or to help one through a period of troubles. The constant movement of pilgrims from all over Iran has helped bind together a linguistically heterogeneous population. Pilgrims serve as major sources of information about conditions in different parts of the country and thus help to mitigate the
parochialism of the regions.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

The vaqf is a traditional source of financial support for all religious institutions. It is a religious endowment by which land and other income-producing property is given in perpetuity for the maintenance of a shrine, mosque, madrassa, or charitable institution such as a hospital, library, or orphanage. A mutavalli administers a vaqf in accordance with the stipulations in the donor's bequest. In many vaqfs, the position of mutavalli is hereditary. Under the Pahlavis, the government attempted to exercise control over administration of the vaqfs, especially those of the larger shrines. This practice caused conflict with the clergy, who perceived the government's efforts as inimical
to their influence and authority in traditional religious matters. The government’s interference with the administration of vaqfs during the Pahlavi era led to a sharp decline in the number of vaqf bequests. Instead, wealthy and pious Shias chose to give financial contributions directly to the leading ayatollahs in the form of zakat, or obligatory alms. The clergy, in turn, used the funds to administer their madrassas and to institute various educational and charitable programs, which indirectly provided them with more influence in society. The access of the clergy to a steady and independent source of funding was an important factor in their ability to resist state controls, and ultimately helped them direct the opposition to the shah.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

'''Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh Dhanju''' (1875 – 20 February 1921) played an important role in awakening the Sikh masses during [[Gurdwara Reform Movement]] in the early quarter of the 20th century  as also for the liberation of Sikh Gurdwaras from the corrupt Mohants. He is the leading Sikh figure among the list of [[Sikh]] [[martyr]]s who  struggled for and volunteered the liberation of Gurdwara [[Nankana Sahib]] from the clutches of Mahant Narain Das on 20 February 1921. The supreme sacrifices made by  Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh and his  other companions have been acknowledged by the grateful  Sikh nation. From that day onwards, the Sikh nation remembers these brave Sikhs in their daily ardas (prayer). Every year on 21 February at this Shaheedi Asthan, [[Guru Granth Sahib]]'s ''Swaroop'' with Bullet marks is brought to Deewan (assembly hall) from 2pm to 4pm for darshan of the Sikh Sangat.

==Family background and early life==
Bhai Tehal Singh was born on Diwali Night of 1875, Dhanju Kamboj family of village Nizampur, District Amritsar.  His father was Sardar Chanda Singh Dhanju and mother Sardarani Rukman Kaur Dhanju. The family moved to  Chak No  38, Village Nizampur Deva Singh Wala, District Sheikhupur during the colonization of Lower [[Chenab]] Bar in the early years of the 19th century.  Bhai Tehal Singh went to [[British Malaya|Malaya]] in 1902 and for some time he worked as watchman in [[Kualalumpur]] but had to return to [[India]] in 1909 due to some family issue. He again left for Malaya in 1911  but due to death of his father in 1915, he had to come back again in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Encyloppedia of Sikhism,  Vol IV, 1997, p 298, Harbans Singh.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the cause of Sikhism==
Soon after his second return from Malaya, Bhai Tehal Singh took Amrit-pan and jumped into the Sikh Gurdwara Reform Movement. He played a very active role to awaken the migrant Sikh farmers of the Canal Colony, Sheikhupura, and spread the message of Sikh Gurus in numerous villages around Nizampur Deva Singh Wala. He participated in the Political Conference of Dharowal as well as in the Movement started by the Sikh Community to liberate Gurdwara Sacha Sauda Chuharkana and Gurdwara Tarn Taran from the control of Mohants. Bhai Tehal Singh had joined the squad which went to liberate Gurdawara [[Tarn Taran Sahib|Tarn Taran]] from the Mahant control on 26 January 1921 and was badly injured in the brick-bats thrown at the Jatha volunteers by the pujaris.&lt;ref&gt;Kamboj Itihaas, 1972, p 185, H. S. Thind.&lt;/ref&gt; He also volunteered in the morcha launched by Sikhs in connection with Gurdwara Rikab Ganj wall in Delhi.&lt;ref name="Ages 2005, p 303"&gt;The Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, p 303, Kirpal Singh.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libration of Gurdawara Nankana Sahib==
But his most active and memorable contribution is noticeable in the liberation of Gurdawara Nankana Sahib from Mahant Narain Dass. On 24 January, members of the Akali Dal including [[Master Tara Singh]], Harbans Singh Attari,  [[Sunder Singh Lyallpuri|Master Sundar Singh Lyallpuri]], [[Teja Singh Samundari]], Harchand Singh, [[Kartar Singh Jhabbar]], Bhai Dalip Singh Lyallpuri, Jaswant Singh Jhabal, Sardul Singh Kavishar etc. convened a meeting in the "Akali" office, Lyallpur &lt;ref&gt;Office of Akali newspaper edited by [[Sunder Singh Lyallpuri|Master Sundar Singh Lyallpuri]], the founder and Director Akali Dal.&lt;/ref&gt; and decided to hold a ''Panthik Diwan'' on 4, 5 and 6 March 1921 in Nankana to take control of the Gurdawara complex from Mahant Narain Das. The Akali leaders got the news through their detectives that the Mahant had devised a murderous plan to invite the Akali leaders at Gurdawara Nankana Sahib on 5 March and have them all killed. This news incensed the Sikhs greatly. To foil Mahant's foul designs, hot-blooded Sikh leaders including Jathedar Kartar Singh Jhabbar, Bhai Buta Singh Lyallpuri, Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali, Bhai Tehal Singh Nizam Deva Singh wala etc. held a meeting on 17 February 1921 at Gurdawara Sacha Sauda and decided to lead a Shaheedi Jatha to Gurdawara Nankana Sahib on 29 February 1921 and seize its control from the Mahant prior to the ''Panthik Diwan''. The planning  to send Bhai Buta Singh Lyallpuri  directly to  Nankana Sahib on 19 February 1921, while two Jathas would be organized under Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali and Bhai Kartar Singh Jhabbar which would meet and unite into a single Jatha at Chandar kot jhal on 19 February 1921 (evening). From there onwards the unified Jatha would proceed to Nankana Sahib in the pal of night and reach Gurdawara Nankana Sahib early morning (nectral hours) of 20 February and seize control of the Gurdawara.

Enthused and imbued by the spirit to do something for the Sikh Panth, Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh extensively toured numerous villages of Chak No 80, No 38, No 18 and No 10 comprising Nizampur Deva Singh Wala, Mula Singh Wala, Chelewala, Dalla Chand Singh, Thothian, Dhanuwal, Bohoru etc. which were all inhabited by the [[Kamboj]] [[colonist]]s from district [[Amritsar]]. He was able to collect a Jatha (squad) of about 150 Sikh recruits, majority of whom from the Kamboj community of the region. This Jatha was merged with the Jatha of 23 Sikhs brought by Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali.&lt;ref&gt;Kamboj Itihaas, 1972, p 184, H. S. Thind.&lt;/ref&gt; After performing Ardas (Sikh prayer) on 19 February 1921, the combined Jatha set on march towards Gurdawara [[Nankana Sahib]] under overall commandership of Jathedar Lachhman Singh Dharowali.  When the Jatha reached Chandar kot jhal, some among the volunteers decided to stop and wait for the other Jatha from Jathedar Kartar Singh Jhabbar to join as decided in on 17 February meeting. At this very moment, Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh thrust himself forward saying: ''"Dear Khalsa ji,  we don't want to wait for anybody. We have taken our resolve at the prayer (Ardaas) and it is imperative for us to move forward now."''.  The Jatha resumed its journey thence-afterwards following Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh &lt;ref&gt;Kamboj Itihaas, 1972, p 186, H. S. Thind.&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing its onwards march reciting Shabad Gurbani all through the night. On 20 February 1921, early morning when the Jatha had just entered the outer skirts of  Nankana City near Brick-kilns (Bhattha), Chaudhury Pal Singh Layalpuri brought and conveyed message from Bhai Dalip Singh Sangla to Jathedar Lachhman Singh Dharowali urging him to suspend the march. Chaudhury also gripped Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh from behind to stop him. Jathedar Lacchman Singh had great regard for Bhai Dalip Singh Sangla and thus agreed to disband the Jatha but Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh once again thrust himself to pull Chaudhury Pal Singh away from Jathedar Lachhman Singh's body and spoke thus: ''"Khalsa ji, it is time not to stop but to move now. We started from our homes with commitments made under Ardas (prayer) to achieve martyrdom. It is very un-Singh-like to suspend the march and return home.....Today is also very special day for us since it coincides with the birth day of [[Guru Har Rai]] ji who, though possessed army and weapons, yet did not use them in spite of numerous provocations from his enemies......The worst the Mahant could do is kill us, but who is afraid of death?"''. And he further reminded the volunteers to remain peaceful and avoid any provocation and act of retaliation.&lt;ref name="Ages 2005, p 303"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gurdawar Reform Movement and Sikh Awakening, SGPC, 1984, p 159, Teja Singh.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Saka Nankana Sahib, "Bed-Time stories -7", Santok singh Jagdev of Sikh missionary society.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthused by the speech of Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh, the entire Shaheedi Jatha including Jathedar Bhai Lacchamn Singh Dharowali resumed the march following Bhai Tehal Singh. At about 5.00 AM when the Jatha was quite close to the Gurdawara complex, another horseman messenger, Bhai Waryama Singh (Ram Singh?), arrived with letter from the Akali leadership. In vain did he too try to persuade Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh and the Jatha to return. Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh continued to lead the Jatha and walk towards the Gurdwara. Bhai Lachhman Singh and others repeatedly requested him to relent, but determined Bhai Tehal Singh stuck to his Ardas.&lt;ref&gt;Sikh Gurdwaras in History and Role of Jhabbar,  Karnail Singh  See Link {{cite web|url=http://www.sikhstudies.org/Periodicals.asp?TtlCod%3D811 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615202825/http://www.sikhstudies.org/Periodicals.asp?TtlCod=811 |archivedate=15 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jatha soon entered Darshni Deohri of the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib at about 6.00 AM, February 20, 1921. While some of the devotees from death squad took their seats inside the ''Prakash Asthan'', others sat on the platform and the Baran dari. Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali sat on Guru's 'Taabiya'  (Behind [[Guru Granth Sahib]]).

The Mahant had got the news of the Jatha's arrival at Chander kot on the 19th February evening. He had gathered his men at night and briefed them about their duties. After the Jatha had sat down, the Mahant signaled his men to carry out the predetermined plan. They closed the main gate and started firing from roof tops. Twenty-six Singhs became martyrs to those bullets in the courtyard while another sixty or so sitting inside the Darbar Sahib became targets of bullets. When the Mahant's men saw no one moving, they came down with swords and choppers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Any Singh they found breathing was cut to pieces. Thus 86 Jatha Singhs including Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh of Nizam Deva Singh Wala and Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh of Dharowali achieved supreme martyrdom for the glory of the Sikh Panth. Next day, 21 February 1921, Mr King, Commissioner Lahore handed over the keys of the Gurdawara complex to Sardar Harbans Singh.  Thus, the peaceful Sikhs had won a decisive and glorious battle against the corrupt Mahant backed by powerful British Imperialist bureaucracy.

==Statistics on fatalities==
There are different versions on number of fatalities in this [[holocaust]]. Some writers put the death figures at 120, 150 or even 200. The government reports placed the death figures at 126.  Police inspector Bachan Singh had put the number at 156. The report by Nankana Sahib Committee published in ''Shaheedi Jeewan'' however, placed the deaths at 86 and also listed the strength of the Shaheedi Jatha at 200.&lt;ref&gt;Giani Partap Singh, Gurdwara Arthaat Akali Lehir, 1975, p 104.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that, besides Shaheedi Jatha Singhs, many non-participant devotees and others staying within Gurdwara also fell victims to Mahant's barbarism.

It has its roots in the [[Kongo people|Kongo]]-[[Angola]] culture and is still kept alive today in Cuba by folkloric groups.  Practitioners are referred to as ''maniseros''.&lt;ref name="Lopes"&gt;{{cite book |title=Enciclopédia brasileira da diáspora africana |last=Lopes |first=Nei |year=2004 |publisher = Selo Negro |page=62 |isbn=85-87478-21-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''mani'' (or accented ''maní'' in Spanish to indicate stress on the final syllable) is said to mean 'war',&lt;ref name="Ortiz, Fernando 1951" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt; in an indeterminate African language, and is not a reference to 'peanuts', which the word ''maní'' can also refer to in [[Cuban Spanish]].&lt;ref name="Quijano"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shiaimagazine.net/news/7-articles-and-interviews/17-miguel-quijano.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120606114817/http://www.shiaimagazine.net/news/7-articles-and-interviews/17-miguel-quijano.html |archivedate=June 6, 2012 |title=Miguel Quijano |work=Shiai Magazine |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=December 25, 2011 |first=Henry Aurélien |last=Obama}} Detailed interview with a contemporary instructor.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its longer Spanish names, ''juego de maní'',&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt; ('game of ''mani''&lt;nowiki /&gt;' or '&lt;nowiki /&gt;''maní'' game') and ''baile de maní''&lt;ref name="Ortiz, Fernando 1951" /&gt; ('dance of ''mani''&lt;nowiki /&gt;' or '&lt;nowiki /&gt;''maní'' dance') would thus mean 'war game' or 'war dance', respectively, when fully translated from both languages.

An even longer name recorded is ''juego de maní con grasa'' (loosely, '&lt;nowiki /&gt;''maní'' greased game' or 'war game with grease') because of its smooth and slippery qualities.&lt;ref name="Ortiz, Fernando 1951" /&gt;

In English, some modern practitioners call it simply '''mani''', with no accent.&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt;  The descriptive term '''mani stick-fighting''' may also be encountered.&lt;ref name="MAFSAW"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pzDTYdi9RnwC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=Mani+stick+fighting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x-T3TqfzFKixiQL-7sXHDg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mani%20stick%20fighting&amp;f=false | title=The Way of the Warrior: Martial Arts and Fighting Styles from Around the World |publisher=DK Publishing |date=2008 |accessdate=December 25, 2011 |last1=Crudelli |first1=Chris |last2=Ross |first2=Chris}} Note that this source spells it both "stick fighting" and "stick-fighting" on the same page.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Cuban ''juego de maní'' is related to Brazilian ''[[capoeira]]'' in its African roots, as both derive from the [[Kongo people|Kongo]]-[[Angola]] culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=try Oritz or Lopes}} As with other similar dance and martial artforms arising in the 16th century onward among [[Transatlantic slave trade|African slaves]] in [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonies in the Americas]], ''juego de maní'' developed initially as means for the slaves to disguise fighting practice as a form of dance, in their scarce free time from labor. Some of their masters would recognize it as fighting competition and gamble on the outcomes.&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt;  It is thought that sometimes slaves were made to fight to the death for their masters' sport.&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt;

The distinct Cuban ''juego de maní'' form had emerged clearly by the 19th century on Cuban sugar-cane plantations,&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt; by then staffed by free people of mixed [[Afro-Cuban]] ancestry.

Originally, Cuban women also danced ''juego de maní'', and this was outlawed in the 1930s, but was still performed.&lt;ref name="Ortiz, Fernando 1951" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel 2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dancing Wisdom: Embodied Knowledge in Haitian Vodou, Cuban Yoruba, and Bahian Candomblé |last=Daniel |first=Yvonne |year=2005 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=62 |isbn=0-252-07207-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, ''maní'' is  very folkloric, and those who practice it do so mainly as a pastime or for socializing, because it encompasses so much: music, singing, sparring, friendship, etc.

Caricao{{clarify|date=June 2014|reason=No such place. If Curaçao is meant, this is dubious, because it's on the far southern end of the Caribbean.}} has a version, and [[Puerto Rico]] has its own ''maní'' which should not be confused with Cuba's ''juego de maní''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biography of a Runaway Slave |last1=Montejo |first1=Esteban |last2=Barnet |first2=Miguel |last3=Hill |first3=W. Nick |year=1994 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=1-880684-18-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=June 2014}}

== Form, techniques, and music ==

Bouts feature a pair of opponents who follow prescribed dancing and fighting patterns, in a circle.&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt;  In early [[Cuba#Colonial Cuba|colonial Cuba]], ''maní'' involved a solo dancer who danced within a circle of opponents, who tried to strike blows as he executed various jumps and evasive steps.{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=try Oritz or Lopes}} It later became a one-on-one form.

Although not as [[gymnastic]] as [[Capoeira#Capoeira Regional|''capoeira regional'']], it is much more similar to [[Capoeira#Capoeira Angola|''capoeira Angola'']], and to ''l'agya'' (a.k.a. ''damaye'' or ''mayolé'') from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ring of Liberation: Deceptive Discourse in Brazilian Capoeira |last1=Lewis |first1=John Lowell |year=1992 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-47682-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The footwork is similar in theory to the Brazilian ''[[Ginga (capoeira)|ginga]]'', but has a more stomping motion.

The combat system of ''maní'' encompasses techniques such as low kicks,{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=try Oritz or Lopes}} [[Sweep (martial arts)|foot sweeps]],&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt; [[Punch (strike)|punches]],&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt; [[head-butt]]s,&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt; [[elbow strikes]],&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt; and strikes with the forearms, knees, and palms,{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=for forearms, knees, palms; try Oritz or Lopes}} as well as the [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheel]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=try Oritz or Lopes}}  Each fight ends in a sweep, take down or grappling maneuver.{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=try Oritz or Lopes}}

''Maní'' may also use weapons such as a cane staff&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt; (used similarly to those of ''[[calinda]]''-style [[stick-fighting]] in [[Trinidad]] and other Caribbean locales), as well as [[Knife-fighting|knives]],&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt; including the [[machete]] and double machete.{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=try Oritz or Lopes}}  The stick used is about the thickness of a [[sugar cane]]&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt; (whether made of that traditional material or not), and about 16&amp;nbsp;inches (40&amp;nbsp;cm) long.&lt;ref name="MAFSAW" /&gt; The original martial art form of ''juego de maní'' risked particular danger, because the dancer/fighter sometimes wore leather wrist covers, ''muñequeras'', that were adorned with nails and other sorts of metal.{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=try Oritz or Lopes}}

The rhythm of the dance/fight is based on the rhythm that is played by the musicians, and accompanying musicians are expected to synchronize drumming accents with movement accents in the performance. This form was popular in [[Matanzas Province|Matanzas]] and [[Santa Clara Province|Las Villas]] [[Provinces of Cuba|provinces]] and featured circling, competitive male dancing, which influenced non-combative, social dances that were created in Cuba, such as ''[[Cuban rumba#Rumba columbia|rumba Columbia]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=try Oritz or Lopes}}

The music utilized in ''juego de maní'' is that of [[Palo (religion)|Palo Monte]], or simply Palo, an Afro-Cuban religion.  One of the most popular ''maní'' songs is "''Vamos a la guerra si maní''" ('We go to war if [there is] ''maní''&lt;nowiki /&gt;').{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=try Oritz or Lopes}}

==''Maniseros''==
Skilled practitioners are called ''{{lang|es|maniseros}}''.&lt;ref name="Lopes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt;  A grandmaster of the art&lt;ref name="Daniel 1995"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rumba: Dance and Social Change in Contemporary Cuba |last=Daniel |first=Yvonne |year=1995 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-20948-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who still teaches in Cuba is Juan de Dios Ramos Morejón, the founder-director of Cuban folkloric dance company Raices Profundas ('Deep Roots').&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel 1995" /&gt;  De Dios grew up fighting in the streets of Cuba and he has been called a "living encyclopedia" of the art, when he chooses to teach it.&lt;ref name="Daniel 1995" /&gt;  He has been an ambassador of Afro-Cuban music and martial arts for many years, having traveled to teach in places as diverse as [[Germany]], [[Japan]], the [[United States]], and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Daniel 1995" /&gt;  His Puerto Rican New Yorker protegé Miguel Quijano (a current mani teacher and instructional author) notes De Dios as also a ''[[Santería|santero]]'', and a ceremonial singer "versed in Yoruba, Palo, Abakua, and Arara traditions, known throughout Cuba".&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt;

De Dios was in turn a student, with seven others, of the great ''manisero'' Argeliers Leon.&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt;  Quijano writes of the eight graduates of Leon that they "knew the art ... in its entirety", as both a dance form and a martial art,&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt; and were founding members of the Conjunto Folklorico Nacional (Cuba's 'National Folkloric Connection' dance organization),&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel 1995" /&gt; where they taught "a folkloric version", i.e. one oriented to dance performance.&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt;

It is through these folklorical groups that Palo and ''maní'' are kept alive. Although a few masters still exist in Cuba, not many truly understand the fighting aspects of the art over the folkloric dance version.&lt;ref name="Daniel 1995" /&gt;  According to Quijano, who has studied under several of them, the only living master ''maniseros'' are Juan de Dios, Carlos Aldama, and Rogelio Martinez Fure (he also counts Cuban journalist Alberto Pedro, but as a retired practitioner).&lt;ref name="Quijano" /&gt;

'''Julia Maesa''' (7 May before 160 AD - {{circa|224}} AD) was a 3rd century  [[List of Augustae|Augusta]] (empress) of the [[Roman Empire]] and a powerful, prominent and influential figure in the empire's politics during the rule of the [[Severan dynasty]]. Born in [[Homs|Emesa]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]] (modern day [[Homs]]), Maesa was the daughter of the high priest of [[Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Homs)|Emesa's Temple of the Sun]], and the elder sister of future Roman empress [[Julia Domna]].

Through her sister's marriage, she became sister-in law to the emperor [[Septimius Severus]] and later the aunt of emperors [[Caracalla]] and [[Geta (emperor)|Geta]]. She herself married fellow Syrian [[Julius Avitus]], who was of consular rank.{{sfn|Grant|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sCYMAm1k4KwC&amp;pg=PA47 47]}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} She bore him two daughters, [[Julia Soaemias]] and [[Julia Mamaea]],{{sfn|Salisbury|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HF0m3spOebcC&amp;pg=PA183 183]}} who would later became mothers of emperors [[Elagabalus]] and [[Severus Alexander]] respectively.{{sfn|Grant|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sCYMAm1k4KwC&amp;pg=PA47 47]}}

The [[Severan dynasty]] of ancient Rome was dominated by powerful women, one of which was Julia Maesa. Politically able and ruthless, she contended for political power after her sister's suicide.{{sfn|Salisbury|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HF0m3spOebcC&amp;pg=PA183 183]}} She is best known for her plotting and scheming which resulted in the restoration of the Severan dynasty to the Roman throne after the assassination of Caracalla and the usurpation of the Roman throne by [[Macrinus]],{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209 209]}} after which she continued to shape and dominate the politics of the Roman Empire for well over two decades, being the major power behind the Roman throne in the subsequent reigns of Elagabalus and Severus Alexander until her death.{{sfn|Salisbury|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HF0m3spOebcC&amp;pg=PA183 183]}}

Julia Maesa died in Rome at an uncertain date between 223 and 226,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA217 217]}} and was later deified in Syria along with her sister.{{sfn|Lee|2016|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RfBWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 16]}}{{sfn|Grant|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sCYMAm1k4KwC&amp;pg=PA47 47]}}

== Early life and marriage ==
{{double image|right|Perge - Julia Soemias 2.jpg|140|Julia mammea02 pushkin.jpg|130|Maesa's daughters, [[Julia Soaemias]] and [[Julia Mamaea]]}}
Julia Maesa was born in 7 May{{sfn|Lee|2016|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RfBWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 16]}} before around 160AD, the elder daughter of the priest [[Julius Bassianus]] in [[Homs|Emesa]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], modern day [[Homs]].{{sfn|Birley|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 72]}} She had a younger sister, [[Julia Domna]] who would later become Roman empress after her marriage to [[Septimius Severus]] who was by the time of their marriage a senator.{{sfn|Levick|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjkfKsCttrkC&amp;pg=PA23 23]}}

As she was an [[Arab people|Arab]],{{sfn|Shahid|1984|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W4H97SA6pMAC&amp;pg=PA33 33]}}{{sfn|Birley|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA222 222]}} her [[cognomen]], Maesa, is the feminine nomen agentis of the Arabic verb "masa" which signifies walking with a swinging gait.{{sfn|Shahid|1984|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W4H97SA6pMAC&amp;pg=PA41 41]}}{{sfn|Birley|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA222 222]}} This would be an appropriate female name as the verb from which it was derived was used by Arab poets to describe the figures of the women that they write about.{{sfn|Shahid|1984|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W4H97SA6pMAC&amp;pg=PA41 41]}}

She later married a fellow Syrian, [[Julius Avitus]], a consul who also served as provincial governor in the empire.{{sfn|Grant|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sCYMAm1k4KwC&amp;pg=PA47 47]}} She bore him two daughters, her eldest daughter, [[Julia Soaemias]], was born around 180 AD{{sfn|Kean|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XFsYAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA120 120]}} or some time before,{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA56 56]}} and was followed by another daughter, [[Julia Mamaea]] not long after.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}}

=== Appearance ===
Although no written account describing her appearance survives, her sharp and formidable features, which contradict the soft and sensitive ones of her sister,{{sfn|Levick|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjkfKsCttrkC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}} are well displayed on the coins minted during the reign of her grandchildren.{{sfn|Grant|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sCYMAm1k4KwC&amp;pg=PA47 47]}}

== Life in Rome ==
{{double image|right|Septimius Severus Glyptothek Munich 357.jpg|200|Caracalla MAN Napoli Inv6033 n01.jpg|200|Busts of Septimius Severus (left) and Caracalla (right)}}
After her sister's arrival to Rome and the beginning of her tenure as empress consort, Maesa, accompanied by her family, traveled to Rome where they took up residence in the imperial court,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} although her husband, [[Julius Avitus]] who held several important posts did not stay in Rome for long and had to make many travels across the empire, which she did not accompany him on.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA56 56]}}

During their stay in Rome, she and her family amassed extreme wealth and fortune,{{sfn|Lightman|Lightman|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2esYJJUETiYC&amp;pg=PA171 171]}} and rose highly in the Roman government and court of [[Septimius Severus]] and later, his son and successor [[Caracalla]].{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} Her two daughters attained a prominent position in court while their Syrian husbands held important posts as provincial governors and consuls,{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA58 58]}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} with Maesa's own husband along with that of her daughter rising from the [[Equites|Equestrian rank]] to reach Senatorial rank.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA58 58]}}

In 217 AD, after the murder of emperor Caracalla and the usurpation of the throne by [[Macrinus]], Maesa's sister, Domna, now with none of the power or influence she held during the reigns of her husband and her son, suffering from breast cancer, and having lost both of her children, chose to commit suicide by starvation.{{sfn|Salisbury|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HF0m3spOebcC&amp;pg=PA183 183]}}{{sfn|Birley|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192 192]}}

Maesa and her family, who had resided in Rome for the last two decades,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} were spared and ordered by Macrinus to leave Rome and return to their home town of Emesa in Syria,{{sfn|Lightman|Lightman|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2esYJJUETiYC&amp;pg=PA171 171]}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} likely because Macrinus wanted to avoid any action that would seem disloyal to Caracalla's memory to avoid any reprisals from the army.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} Macrinus made the crucial mistake of leaving Maesa's great wealth, amassed over a period of over 20 years intact,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}}{{sfn|Lightman|Lightman|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2esYJJUETiYC&amp;pg=PA171 171]}} a decision which Macrinus would regret not long after.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA56 56]}}

Maesa, who arrived in Emesa sometime between spring 217 and spring 218,{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA58 58]}} vowed revenge,{{sfn|Bunson|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T5tic2VunRoC&amp;pg=PA193 193]}} and Domna's suicide was still far off from ending the influence of the powerful women of the family.{{sfn|Salisbury|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HF0m3spOebcC&amp;pg=PA183 183]}}

== Restoration of the Severan dynasty ==
[[File:Julia Domna Glyptothek Munich 354.jpg|thumb|Roman empress [[Julia Domna]], Maesa's sister, committed suicide after the murder of her son Caracalla]]
Macrinus was in a difficult position after Caracalla's assassination and was struggling to gain legitimacy and maintain loyalty to his rule.{{sfn|Birley|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192 192]}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} This encouraged Maesa, whose location, Emesa, which was close to a military base where many soldiers still held the Severans in high esteem and were loyal to the dynasty,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} aside from their discontent over Macrinus' peace with the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]s,{{sfn|Birley|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192 192]}} made it an excellent choice to launch a coup to restore her family to power.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}}

The first step was to choose a male candidate from within the family to replace the usurper.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} [[Julius Avitus|Maesa's own husband]] has died in Cyprus shortly before 217,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} as well as her [[Sextus Varius Marcellus|eldest daughter's husband]].{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} Julia Soaemias had a 14-year old son, [[Elagabalus|Varius Avitus Bassianus]], who was the hereditary priest of the Emesan sun god,{{sfn|Birley|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192 192]}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} and Maesa had a different future in mind for him.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 207]}} He had began attracting the soldiers of the [[Legio III Gallica]] stationed near Emesa, who would visit the city's temple occasionally to view the extravagant yet amusing religious rituals of Bassianus.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}}

Now even further encouraged by the attention of the soldiers, she proceeded with her plot by trying to challenge the legitimacy of the new emperor Macrinus, and she did so by claiming that the 14 year old, who greatly resembled Caracalla, was indeed the former emperor's bastard son and that Caracalla slept with both her daughters.{{sfn|Lightman|Lightman|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2esYJJUETiYC&amp;pg=PA171 171]}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209 209]}} The claim that Bassianus was the love child of Caracalla and Soaemias, despite almost certainly being untrue,{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}} was not so easily refuted, as aside from the young boy's resemblance to the emperor,{{sfn|Lightman|Lightman|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2esYJJUETiYC&amp;pg=PA171 171]}} Soaemias had been living in the Roman court at the time of Caracalla's reign,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209 209]}} and Maesa seemed not to mind that this claim would be sacrificing the honor and reputation of her daughters as it was, after all, an effective move to further her plan.{{sfn|Halsberghe|1972|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8tIUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA60 60]}}

Julia Maesa began offering to distribute her great wealth and fortune to the loyal soldiers in exchange for their support,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209 209]}} news of which began to spread throughout the army camps.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}} Maesa, her daughter and Bassianus were taken into the army camp at night where the 14 year old boy was immediately acknowledged and hailed as emperor by the soldiers and clad in imperial purple.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}}

Historian [[Cassius Dio]] narrates a slightly different version of events; he mentions a certain [[Gannys]], who is not mentioned as partaking in the plot at any other source, as the main instigator of the revolt.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}} Allegedly a 'youth who has not yet reached manhood', Dio claims he was raised by Maesa and was Soaemias' lover and the protector of her son,{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}} and at a certain night, dressed Bassianus in clothes worn by Caracalla as a child, took him to the army camp and claimed he was the murdered emperor's son without the knowledge of either Soaemias or Maesa.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}}

It is hard to believe that Maesa and Soaemias, with much to gain from the young boy becoming emperor, would be completely unaware of the actions of Gannys.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}} On the other hand, it's also unlikely that Maesa alone orchestrated the young boy's ascension. It's likely that Maesa in her plan had the support of many important figures from the city of Emesa and even some figures in Rome's ruling elite.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}}

=== Reaction of Macrinus ===
[[File:Aureus Macrinus-RIC 0079 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Macrinus]], who usurped the Roman throne in 217 AD]]
With the support of an entire legion, other legionnaires, prompted by discontent over pay, deserted Macrinus and joined Elagabalus' ranks as well. In response to the growing threat, Macrinus sent out a cavalry force under the command of Ulpius Julianus to try and regain control of the rebel soldiers. Rather than capturing the rebel forces, the cavalry instead killed Ulpius and defected to Elagabalus.{{sfn|Gibbon|1961|p=183}}{{sfn|Mennen|2011|p=165}}

Following these events, Macrinus traveled to [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]] to ensure the loyalty of [[Legio II Parthica|Legio II ''Parthica'']] before setting off to march against Emesa.{{sfn|Downey|1961|pp=249–250}} According to Dio, Macrinus appointed his son Diadumenian to the position of [[Imperator]], and promised the soldiers 20,000 Sesterces each, with 4,000 of these to be paid on the spot. Dio further says that Macrinus hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian.{{sfn|Dio|1927|p=417}}{{sfn|Dio|1927|loc=79.34.3}} At the dinner, Macrinus was supposedly presented with the head of Ulpius Julianus who had been killed by his soldiers.{{sfn|Dio|1927|p=417}}{{sfn|Dio|1927|loc=79.34.4}} In response, Macrinus left Apamea and headed south.{{sfn|Downey|1961|pp=249–250}}

Macrinus' and Elagabalus' troops met somewhere near the border of [[Syria Coele (Roman province)|Syria Coele]] and [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Syria Phoenice]]. Despite Macrinus' efforts to quell the rebellion at this engagement, his whole legion defected to Elagabalus forcing Macrinus to retire to [[Antioch]]. Elagabus took to the offensive and marched on Antioch.{{sfn|Downey|1961|pp=249–250}}

==== Battle of Antioch ====
{{main|Battle of Antioch (218)}}
Elagabalus' armies, commanded by the inexperienced but determined [[Gannys]], engaged Macrinus' Praetorian Guard in a narrowly fought [[pitched battle]].{{sfn|Gibbon|1961|p=184}} Gannys commanded at least two full legions and held numerical superiority over the fewer levies that Macrinus had been able to raise. Macrinus had ordered the Praetorian Guard to set aside their scaled armour breastplates and grooved shields in favour of lighter oval shields prior to the battle. This made them lighter and more manoeuvrable and negated any advantage light Parthian lancers had.{{sfn|Dio|1927|p=425}}{{sfn|Dio|1927|loc=79.37.4}} The Praetorian Guards broke through the lines of Gannys' force, which turned to flee. During the retreat, however, Julia Maesa and Soaemias, in a surprising act of heroism joined the fray, leaping from their chariots to rally the retreating forces,{{sfn|Lightman|Lightman|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2esYJJUETiYC&amp;pg=PA172 172]}} while Gannys charged on horseback headlong into the enemy. These actions effectively ended the retreat; the troops resumed the assault with renewed morale, turning the tide of battle.{{sfn|Gibbon|1961|p=184}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2009|pp=78–79}} Fearing defeat, Macrinus fled back to the city of Antioch,{{sfn|Downey|1961|pp=249–250}} attempting escape before being executed in [[Cappadocia]],{{sfn|Crevier|1814|p=237}}{{sfn|Bell|1834|p=229}} while his son [[Diadumenian]] was captured en route in [[Zeugma]], and executed as well.{{sfn|Vagi|2000|p=290}}

Elagablus entered Antioch as its emperor, refraining the soldiers from sacking the city and sending a message to the senate who were forced to accept the young boy as their new emperor.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA14 14]}} Upon ascension he took up the name ''Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus''.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA55 55]}}

== Reign of Elagabalus ==
{{main|Elagabalus}}
[[File:Bust of Elagabalus - Palazzo Nuovo - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|left|Head of Elagabalus]]
Although now declared emperor, his claim was not uncontested, however, as several others laid claim to the Roman Throne. These included Verus the commander of [[Legio III Gallica]] who ironically was the first to proclaim Elagabalus as emperor, and Gellius Maximus the commander of Legio IV Scythica. These rebellions were quashed and their instigators executed.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA14 14]}}

Elagabalus spent the winter of 218-219 in [[Nicomedia]] before he set off to enter [[Rome]].{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA17 17]}} Maesa allegedly urged him to enter the capital draped in Roman clothes, but instead, he had a painting of him made as a priest making offerings to the Emesene deity [[Elagabalus (deity)|El-Gabal]].{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA17 17]}} The painting was hanged right above the statue of [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] in the senate, putting senators in the awkward position of having to make offerings to the Syrian deity whenever they wanted to make offerings to Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/articles/person/heliogabalus/heliogabalus-2/?#Life1 Heliogabalus (2) - Livius]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Maesa and her daughter Soaemias are featured heavily in all literary accounts of his reign, and are credited with much influence over the young emperor.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}} Julia Maesa was honored with the titles of 'Augusta, mater castrorum et senatus' (empress, mother of the camp and the senate) and 'avia Augusti' (grandmother of the emperor).{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}

Soon, the young emperor was no longer popular with the praetorians, who did not approve of his revolting behavior and his odd religious rituals,{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA37 37]}} and considering how their support was crucial for his rule to survive, this was an extremely dangerous development.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA37 37]}} Julia Maesa decided to take measures to prevent things from getting too out of hand.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA37 37]}} She convinced her grandson to adopt his cousin, her grandson [[Severus Alexander|Alexander]], and declare him caesar, with the argument that it would leave more time for Elagabalus to devote himself to religious matters.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA37 37]}} The adoption of the 12 years old Alexander provided a strategic shift for the supporters of Elagablus,{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA37 37]}} as some of the supporters felt it was no longer wise to tie their fate with that of the priest emperor and saw an alternative in his adopted son.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA37 37]}}{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA38 38]}}
[[File:Julia Maesa obversee.png|thumb|left|A coin of Julia Maesa from [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]] struck during Elagabalus' reign]]
Whatsoever, rivalry was soon increasing between the two boys and Elagabalus regretted adopting his more-popular cousin.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA39 39]}} The soldiers began to look more favorably upon Elagabalus' cousin, and the allies and supporters of the dynasty as well as the imperial family itself became divided,{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA39 39]}} with Elagabalus and Soaemias on one side, and Mamaea, Maesa and Alexander on the other.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 214]}}

By the beginning of 222, Alexander and Elagabalus became so estranged with each other that they no longer appeared together in public.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 214]}} An assassination attempt against Alexander by Elagabalus enraged the praetorian guards who demanded an assurance for Alexander's safety from Elagabalus and the dismissal of some certain officials.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 214]}} Elagablus broke his promise, prompting the praetorian guard to slay Elagabalus and his mother, cutting their heads off and throwing aside their bodies.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 214]}} Alexander was now proclaimed emperor.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 214]}}

A traditionally held belief is that while the new emperor was mainly involved in religious matters, Julia Maesa and her daughter were the ones effectively running the state.{{sfn|Icks|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-yecRsy847AC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}} This claim has been treated with caution by contemporary historians such as Barabara Levick, as in ancient Rome, politics and religion were intertwined together and the rule of Elagabalus and the supremacy of his deity broke this relationship.{{sfn|Levick|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjkfKsCttrkC&amp;pg=PA149 149]}} In any case it's certain that Maesa had influence over the young boy, but Elagabalus' disagreements and neglect of advice from Maesa, who can be presented as an advocate of Roman traditionalism, has been reported and it may well be the cause of his downfall.{{sfn|Levick|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjkfKsCttrkC&amp;pg=PA149 149]}}

It is probable that Julia Maesa herself was responsible for the assassination of her daughter and grandson.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215 215]}} This would certainly have been a painful sacrifice for Maesa to make but a necessary one to protect her family's grip on power and preserve the empire's stability.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215 215]}}

== Reign of Severus Alexander ==
{{main|Severus Alexander}}
[[File:Alexander Severus Musei Capitolini MC471.jpg|thumb|Bust of Severus Alexander]]
Alexander ascended the throne at the age of around 15, and he was kept in check by his mother and grandmother who were determined to erase the negative impression of Elagabalus. He was given the name Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexander to emphasize his relationship to Septimius Severus, the founder of the dynasty.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215 215]}}

The epigraphical evidence during Severus Alexander's reign attests that the early years of his reign were dominated by his mother and grandmother, as inscriptions carrying the emperor's name referred to him as ''Juliae Mamaeae Aug(ustae) filio Juliae Maesae Aug(ustae) nepote'' (the son of Julia Mamaea and grandson of Julia Maesa).{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215 215]}}

The changes introduced by Maesa and her daughter included selecting a council of sixteen chosen for their moderation and experience to advise the young emperor, and the two Julias tried to restore a moderate and dignified form of government.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA216 216]}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA217 217]}} The eastern religious practices introduced by the former emperor were eradicated in Rome and his religious edicts were reversed, the sacred stone of [[Elagabalus (deity)|El-Gabal]] was returned to Emesa and the vast temple which had been dedicated to him by Elagabalus was rededicated to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215 215]}}

== Death ==
The most certain date of her death is likely between November 224 and 227.{{sfn|McHugh|2017|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JyIzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT181 181]}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA217 217]}} Her death deprived her daughter, Julia Mamaea, not only of a mother but also of a political mentor and colleague, and Julia Mamaea was now alone in charge of the imperial government.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hL99AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA217 217]}}

=== Deification ===
Like her sister Julia Domna before her was,{{sfn|Levick|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjkfKsCttrkC&amp;pg=PA145 145]}} Julia Maesa was deified.{{sfn|Lee|2016|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RfBWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 16]}} In the ''[[Feriale Duranum]]'', the list of religious observances of the ''Cohors XX Palmyrenorum'', dating to {{circa|227}} AD,{{sfn|McHugh|2017|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JyIzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT181 181]}} Maesa is made a supplication on her birthday which is the 7th of May.{{sfn|Lee|2016|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RfBWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 16]}} Coins commemorating her deification show her borne aloft on the back of a peacock. Unfortunately the coins are undated, but she also appears deified on the ''[[Acta Fratrum Arvalium]]'' of 7 November in 224, which lists the number of gods and goddesses the ''[[Arval Brethren]]'' made sacrifices to on that certain date.{{sfn|McHugh|2017|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JyIzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT181 181]}}

'''Kali Puja''', also known as '''Shyama Puja''' or '''Mahanisha Puja''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diwalifestival.org/regional-names-diwali.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a festival dedicated to the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] goddess [[Kali]], celebrated on the new moon day of the Hindu month [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]] especially in [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]], [[Odisha]], [[Assam]], [[Tripura]] and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name = MK72&gt;McDermott and Kripal p.72&lt;/ref&gt; It coincides with the rest-of-Indian [[Lakshmi Puja]] day of [[Diwali]]. While the [[Bengalis]], [[Odia people|Odias]], [[Assamese people|Assamese]] and [[Maithil]]s adore goddess Kali&lt;ref name = MK72/&gt; on this day the rest of India worships goddess Lakshmi on Diwali. Mahanisha puja is performed by the [[Maithili people]] of [[Mithila (India)|Mithila]] region in India and Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f3LXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=kali+puja+mithila&amp;dq=kali+puja+mithila&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDnfT8p6_XAhUjJcAKHTp2Cm8Q6AEILjAC&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Artisan making an idol of goddess Kali, kumortuli, 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Artisan making an idol of goddess Kali at Kumortuli]]
The festival of Kali Puja is not an ancient one. Kali Puja was practically unknown before the 18th century; however, a late 17th-century devotional text Kalika [[mangalkavya]] –by Balram mentions an annual festival dedicated to Kali.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in Bengal during the 18th century, by King (Raja) Krishnachandra of Navadvipa.&lt;ref name="MK72" /&gt; Kali Puja gained popularity in the 19th century, with Krishanachandra’s grandson Ishvarchandra and the Bengali elite; wealthy landowners began patronizing the  festival on a grand scale.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Durga Puja]], Kali Puja is the biggest festival in Bengal and Assam.&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
Kali Puja (like [[Durga Puja]]) worshippers honour the goddess Kali in their homes in the form of clay [[Murti|sculptures]] and in [[Pandal|''pandal''s]] (temporary shrines or open pavilions). She is worshipped at night with [[Tantra|Tantric]] rites and [[mantra]]s. She is prescribed offerings of red [[hibiscus]] flowers, animal blood in a skull, sweets, rice and lentils, [[Panchamakara|fish and meat]]. It is prescribed that a worshipper should meditate throughout the night until dawn.&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Homes and pandals may also practice rites in the ''[[Brahmanical]]'' (mainstream Hindu-style, non-Tantric) tradition with ritual dressing of Kali in her form as Adya Shakti Kali and no animals are sacrificed. She is offered food and sweets made of rice, lentils and fruits.&lt;ref name = "MCDa"/&gt; However in Tantric tradition, Animals are [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|ritually sacrificed]] on Kali Puja day and offered to the goddess.&lt;ref name = MK72/&gt; A celebration of Kali Puja in [[Kolkata]] , [[Bhubaneswar]] and in [[Guwahati]] is also held in a large [[Shmashana|cremation ground]]&lt;ref name = "f86"&gt;Fuller p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; where she is believed to dwell.

The ''pandal''s also house images of god [[Shiva]] - the consort of Kali, [[Ramakrishna]] and [[Bamakhepa]]- two famous Bengali Kali devotees along with scenes from mythology of Kali and her various forms along with [[Mahavidya]]s, sometimes considered as the "ten Kalis." The Mahavidyas is a group of ten Tantric goddesses headed by Kali.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley p.18&lt;/ref&gt; People visit these ''pandals'' throughout the night. Kali Puja is also the time for magic shows and theatre, fireworks.&lt;ref name = "MCDa"&gt;McDaniel pp. 249-50, 54&lt;/ref&gt; Recent custom has incorporated wine consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Harding p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kalighat Temple in [[Kolkata]], Kalikhetra Temple in [[Bhubaneswar]] and in Kamakhya Temple in [[Guwahati]], Kali is worshipped as [[Lakshmi]] on this day so as to reflect an essence of [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] Haldars on Kali worship. Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped in her three forms, Maha Lakshmi, Maha Kali and Maha Saraswati on this day.The temple is visited by thousands of devotees who offer animal sacrifices to the goddess.&lt;ref name = MK72/&gt;&lt;ref name = "f86"/&gt; Another famous temple dedicated to Kali in Kolkata is [[Dakshineswar Kali Temple]]. The famous Kali devotee Ramakrishna was a priest at this temple. The celebrations have changed little from his time.&lt;ref&gt;See Harding pp. 125-6 for a detailed account of the rituals in Dakshineshwar.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the widely popular annual Kali Puja celebration, also known as the ''Dipanwita Kali Puja'', is celebrated on the new moon day of the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]], Kali is also worshipped in other new moon days too. Two other major Kali Puja observations are ''Ratanti Kali Puja'' and ''Phalaharini Kali Puja''. Ratanti puja is celebrated on [[Magha (month)|Magha]] Krishna Chaturdashi and Phalaharini puja is celebrated on [[Jyeshta]] Amavashya of Bengali calendar. The ''Phalaharini Kali Puja'' is specially important in the life of the saint [[Ramakrishna]] and his wife [[Sarada Devi]], since on this day in 1872, Ramakrishna worshipped Sarada Devi as the goddess [[Shodashi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gambhirananda |first1=Swami |title= Holy Mother Shri Sarada Devi |edition=1st |year= 1955|publisher= Shri Ramakrishna Ashrama, Madras |location= Madras |pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many Bengali and Assamese households, Kali is worshipped daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Banerjee |first1=Suresh Chandra |title= Shaktiranga Bangabhumi |trans-title= Bengal, The Abode of Shaktism|edition=1st |year= 1991|publisher= Ananda Publishers Pvt Ltd |location= Kolkata |language= bn |isbn= 81-7215-022-9|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louis David Riel ''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|i|_|r|i|ˈ|ɛ|l}}; {{IPA-fr|lwi ʁjɛl|lang}}; 22 October 1844 – 16 November 1885) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician, a founder of the province of [[Manitoba]], and a political leader of the [[Métis in Canada|Métis]] people of the [[Canadian Prairies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher =A database of materials held by the University of Saskatchewan Libraries and the University Archives

Riel sought to preserve Métis rights and culture as their homelands in the Northwest came progressively under the Canadian sphere of influence. Over the decades, he has been made a folk hero by Francophones, Catholic nationalists, native rights activists, and the [[New Left]] student movement. Arguably, Riel has received more scholarly attention than any other figure in Canadian history.&lt;ref name=bumstead&gt;J. M. Bumstead, "The 'Mahdi' of Western Canada: Lewis Riel and His Papers," ''The Beaver'' (1987) 67#4 pp 47-54&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a fugitive, he was elected three times to the [[House of Commons of Canada]], although he never assumed his seat. During these years, he was frustrated by having to remain in exile despite his growing belief that he was a divinely chosen leader and prophet, a belief which would later resurface and influence his actions.  Because of this new religious conviction, Catholic leaders who had supported him before increasingly repudiated him. He married in 1881 while in exile in [[Montana]] in the United States; he fathered three children.

In 1884 Riel was called upon by the Métis leaders in Saskatchewan to articulate their  grievances to the Canadian government.  Instead he organized a military resistance that escalated into a military confrontation, the [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885.  Ottawa used the new rail lines to send in thousands of combat soldiers. It ended in his arrest and conviction for [[Treason Act 1351|high treason]].  Despite protests and popular appeals, Prime Minister Macdonald rejected calls for clemency, and Riel was executed by [[hanging]]. Riel was seen as a heroic victim by [[French Canadians]]; his execution had a lasting negative impact on Canada, polarizing the new nation along ethno-religious lines. Although only a few hundred people were directly affected by the Rebellion in Saskatchewan, the long-term result was that the Prairie provinces would be controlled by the Anglophones, not the Francophones. An even more important long-term impact was the bitter alienation Francophones across Canada felt, and anger against the repression by their countrymen.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Bumsted, ''The Peoples of Canada: A Post-Confederation History'' (1992), pp xiii, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Riel's historical reputation has long been polarized between portrayals as a dangerous half-insane religious fanatic and rebel against the Canadian nation, or by contrast a heroic rebel who fought to protect his Francophone people from the unfair encroachments of an Anglophone national government.  He is increasingly celebrated as a proponent of multiculturalism, although that downplays his primary commitment to Métis nationalism and political independence.&lt;ref name=TCE_Riel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=George F.

==Early life==
[[Image:YoungLouisRiel.gif|thumb|upright|Louis Riel, age 14]]
The [[Red River Colony|Red River Settlement]] was a community in [[Rupert's Land]] nominally administered by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC), and largely inhabited by [[First Nations]] tribes and the Métis, an ethnic group of mixed [[Cree]], [[Ojibwa]], [[Saulteaux]], [[French-Canadian]], Scottish, and English descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

 | accessdate = 5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Riel was born there in 1844, near modern [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], to [[Louis Riel, Sr.]] and Julie Lagimodière.

Riel was the eldest of eleven children in a locally well-respected family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sayer's eventual release due to agitations by Louis Sr.'s group effectively ended the monopoly, and the name Riel was therefore well known in the Red River area. His mother was the daughter of [[Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière]] and [[Marie-Anne Gaboury]], one of the earliest [[White people|white]] families to settle in the Red River Settlement in 1812. The Riels were noted for their devout Catholicism and strong family ties.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (1963), pp. 13–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Riel was first educated by Roman Catholic priests at [[Saint Boniface, Manitoba|St. Boniface]]. At age 13 he came to the attention of [[Alexandre-Antonin Taché|Alexandre Taché]], the [[Suffragan Bishop]] of St. Boniface, who was eagerly promoting the priesthood for talented young Métis. In 1858 Taché arranged for Riel to attend the Petit Séminaire of the [[Collège de Montréal]], under the direction of the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|Sulpician order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptions of him at the time indicate that he was a fine scholar of languages, science, and philosophy, but exhibited a frequent and unpredictable moodiness.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (1963), pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Following news of his father's premature death in 1864, Riel lost interest in the priesthood and withdrew from the college in March 1865. For a time, he continued his studies as a day student in the convent of the [[Grey Nuns]], but was soon asked to leave, following breaches of discipline. He remained in Montreal for over a year, living at the home of his aunt, Lucie Riel. Impoverished by the death of his father, Riel took employment as a law clerk in the Montreal office of [[Rodolphe Laflamme]].&lt;ref name=TCE_Riel/&gt; During this time he was involved in a failed romance with a young woman named Marie–Julie Guernon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Compounding this disappointment, Riel found legal work unpleasant and, by early 1866, he had resolved to leave [[Canada East]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (1963), pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his friends said later that he worked odd jobs in [[Chicago]], Illinois, while staying with poet [[Louis-Honoré Fréchette]], and wrote poems himself in the manner of [[Lamartine]], and that he was briefly employed as a clerk in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], before returning to the Red River settlement on 26 July 1868.&lt;ref&gt;for this section, see Stanley, ''Louis Riel'', pp. 13–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red River Rebellion==
{{Main|Red River Rebellion}}
The majority population of the Red River had historically been Métis and First Nation people. Upon his return, Riel found that religious, nationalistic, and racial tensions were exacerbated by an influx of [[English language|Anglophone]] Protestant settlers from Ontario. The political situation was also uncertain, as ongoing negotiations for the transfer of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company to Canada had not addressed the political terms of transfer. Finally, despite warnings to the Macdonald government from Bishop Taché&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The arrival on 20 August 1869 of a survey party headed by Colonel [[John Stoughton Dennis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Riel emerges as a leader===
In late August, Riel denounced the survey in a speech, and on 11 October 1869, the survey's work was disrupted by a group of Métis that included Riel. This group organized itself as the "Métis National Committee" on 16 October, with Riel as secretary and [[John Bruce (Canada)|John Bruce]] as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Nevertheless, the non-bilingual McDougall was appointed the [[lieutenant governor]]-designate, and attempted to enter the settlement on 2 November. McDougall's party was turned back near the Canada–US border, and on the same day, Métis led by Riel seized [[Fort Garry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

On 6 November, Riel invited Anglophones to attend a convention alongside Métis representatives to discuss a course of action, and on 1 December he proposed to this convention a list of rights to be demanded as a condition of union. Much of the settlement came to accept the Métis point of view, but a passionately pro-Canadian minority began organizing in opposition. Loosely constituted as the [[Canadian Party]], this group was led by [[John Christian Schultz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Canadian Rebellion and the execution of Scott===
Despite the apparent progress on the political front, the Canadian party continued to plot against the provisional government. However, they suffered a setback on 17 February, when forty-eight men, including Boulton and [[Thomas Scott (Orangeman)|Thomas Scott]], were arrested near Fort Garry.

Scott was executed by firing squad on 4 March.  Riel's motivations have been the cause of much speculation, but his own justification was that he felt it necessary to demonstrate to the Canadians that the Métis must be taken seriously.  Protestant Canada did take notice, swore revenge, and set up a "[[Canada First]]" movement to mobilize their anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dimitry Anastakis|title=Death in the Peaceable Kingdom: Canadian History since 1867 through Murder, Execution, Assassination, and Suicide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YpsjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|year=2015|publisher=U of Toronto Press|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Dick,  "Nationalism and Visual Media in Canada: The Case of Thomas Scott's Execution," ''Manitoba History'' (2005) 48#1 pp:2-18&lt;/ref&gt;

As a means of exercising Canadian authority in the settlement and dissuading [[Manifest Destiny|American expansionists]], a Canadian [[Wolseley Expedition|military expedition]] under Colonel [[Garnet Wolseley]] was dispatched to the Red River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The arrival of the expedition on 20 August marked the effective end of the Red River Rebellion.

==Intervening years==

===Amnesty question===
It was not until 2 September 1870 that the new lieutenant-governor [[Adams George Archibald]] arrived and set about the establishment of civil government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However the results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness—perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions—that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871. [[Image:LouisRielPortrait2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Louis Riel circa 1875]]The settlement now faced a possible threat, from cross-border [[Fenian raids#Pembina Raid .281871.29|Fenian raids]] coordinated by his former associate [[William Bernard O'Donoghue]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Swan, "and Edward A.

Companies of armed horsemen were raised, including one led by Riel. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, signaling that a rapprochement had been affected. This was not to be—when this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the [[Canada First]] movement whipped up anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec–Ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty. Instead he quietly arranged for Taché to offer Riel a bribe of [[Canadian dollars|$]]1,000 to remain in voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional [[Pound Sterling|£]]600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Gwyn, ''Nation Maker: Sir John A. Macdonald: His Life, Our Times. 1867-1891'' (2011) 2:150-51&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, by late June Riel was back in Manitoba and was soon persuaded to run as a member of parliament for the electoral district of [[Provencher (electoral district)|Provencher]]. However, following the early September defeat of [[George-Étienne Cartier]] in his home riding in Quebec, Riel stood aside so that Cartier—on record as being in favour of amnesty for Riel—might secure a seat in Provencher. Cartier won by acclamation, but Riel's hopes for a swift resolution to the amnesty question were dashed following Cartier's death on 20 May 1873. In the ensuing by-election in October 1873, Riel ran unopposed as an Independent, although he had again fled, a warrant having been issued for his arrest in September. Lépine was not so lucky; he was captured and faced trial.

Riel made his way to Montreal and, fearing arrest or assassination, vacillated as to whether he should attempt to take up his seat in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]—[[Edward Blake]], the [[Premier of Ontario]], had announced a bounty of $5,000 for his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Louis Riel (1844–1885): Biography Louis Riel, Métis leader | url = http://www.museevirtuel.ca/Exhibitions/Batoche/docs/proof_en_riel_bio.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 23 September 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025003758/http://www.museevirtuel.ca/Exhibitions/Batoche/docs/proof_en_riel_bio.pdf | archivedate = 25 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Famously, Riel was the only Member of Parliament who was not present for the great [[Pacific Scandal]] debate of 1873 that led to the resignation of the Macdonald government in November. [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] leader [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] became the interim [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], and a general election was held in January 1874. Although the Liberals under Mackenzie formed the new government, Riel easily retained his seat. Formally, Riel had to sign a register book at least once upon being elected, and he did so under disguise in late January. He was nevertheless stricken from the rolls following a motion supported by Schultz, who had become the member for the electoral district of [[Lisgar (electoral district)|Lisgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Undeterred, Riel prevailed again in the resulting by-election, and although again expelled, his symbolic point had been made and public opinion in Quebec was strongly tipped in his favour.

===Exile and mental illness===
During this period, Riel had been staying with priests of the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate|Oblate order]] in [[Plattsburgh (town), New York|Plattsburgh]], [[New York (state)|New York]], who introduced him to Father Fabien Martin ''[[Dit name|dit]]'' Barnabé in the nearby village of [[Keeseville, New York|Keeseville]]. It was here that he received news of Lépine's fate: following his trial for the murder of Scott, which had begun on 13 October 1874, Lépine was found guilty and sentenced to death. This sparked outrage in the sympathetic Quebec press, and calls for amnesty for both Lépine and Riel were renewed. This presented a severe political difficulty for Mackenzie, who was hopelessly caught between the demands of Quebec and Ontario. However, a solution was forthcoming when, acting on his own initiative, the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]] commuted Lépine's sentence in January 1875. This opened the door for Mackenzie to secure from parliament an amnesty for Riel, on the condition that he remain in exile for five years.&lt;ref name=TCE_Riel/&gt;

During his time of exile, he was primarily concerned with religious rather than political matters. Spurred on by a sympathetic Roman Catholic priest in Quebec, he was increasingly influenced by his belief that he was a divinely chosen leader of the Métis. Modern biographers have speculated that he may have suffered from the [[Psychology|psychological]] condition [[Narcissism|megalomania]].&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite web

But after Riel disrupted a religious service, Lee arranged to have him committed in an asylum in [[Longue Pointe]] on 6 March 1876 under the assumed name "Louis R. David".&lt;ref name=TCE_Riel/&gt; Fearing discovery, his doctors soon transferred him to the Beauport Asylum near [[Quebec City]] under the name "Louis Larochelle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Montana and family life===
[[Image:Jean-LouisAngeliqueRiel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jean-Louis and Marie-Angélique Riel, children of Louis Riel]]
In the fall of 1878, Riel returned to St. Paul, and briefly visited his friends and family. This was a time of rapid change for the Métis of the Red River—the [[American Bison|buffalo]] on which they depended were becoming increasingly scarce, the influx of settlers was ever-increasing, and much land was sold to unscrupulous land speculators. Like other Red River Métis who had left Manitoba, Riel headed further west to start a new life. Travelling to the [[Montana Territory]], he became a trader and interpreter in the area surrounding [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]]. Observing rampant alcoholism and its detrimental impact on the Native American and Métis people, he engaged in an unsuccessful attempt to curtail the [[whisky]] trade. In 1881, he married Marguerite Monet ''[[Dit name|dit]]'' Bellehumeur (1861–1886),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Riel soon became involved in the politics of Montana, and in 1882, actively campaigned on behalf of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He brought a suit against a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] for rigging a vote, but was then himself accused of fraudulently inducing [[British subject]]s to take part in the election.

==The North-West Rebellion==
{{Main|North-West Rebellion}}

===Grievances in the Saskatchewan territory===
Following the Red River Rebellion, Métis travelled west and settled in the [[Saskatchewan Valley]], especially along the south branch of the river in the country surrounding the Saint-Laurent mission (near modern [[St. Laurent de Grandin, Saskatchewan]]). But by the 1880s, it had become clear that westward migration was no panacea for the troubles of the Métis and the plains Indians. The rapid collapse of the buffalo herd was causing near starvation among the [[Plains Cree]] and [[Blackfoot]] [[First Nations]]. This was exacerbated by a reduction in government assistance in 1883, and by a general failure of Ottawa to live up to its treaty obligations. The Métis were likewise obliged to give up the hunt and take up agriculture—but this transition was accompanied by complex issues surrounding land claims similar to those that had previously arisen in Manitoba. Moreover, settlers from Europe and the eastern provinces were also moving into the Saskatchewan territories, and they too had complaints related to the administration of the territories. Virtually all parties therefore had grievances, and by 1884 English settlers, [[Anglo-Métis]] and Métis communities were holding meetings and petitioning a largely unresponsive government for redress. In the electoral district of [[Lorne (N.W.T. electoral district)|Lorne]], a meeting of the south branch Métis was held in the village of [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]] on 24 March, and thirty representatives voted to ask Riel to return and represent their cause. On 6 May a joint "Settler's Union" meeting was attended by both the Métis and English-speaking representatives from [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]], including [[Honoré Jackson|William Henry Jackson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Riel was easily swayed to support their cause—which was perhaps not surprising in view of Riel's continuing conviction that he was the divinely selected leader of the Métis and the prophet of a new form of Christianity. Riel also intended to use the new position of influence to pursue his own land claims in Manitoba. The party departed 4 June, and arrived back at Batoche on 5 July. Upon his arrival Métis and English settlers alike formed an initially favourable impression of Riel following a series of speeches in which he advocated moderation and a reasoned approach.

===Break with the church===
Historian Donald Creighton has argued that Riel had become a changed man:
:In the 15 years since he had left Red River, his megalomania had grown greater than ever. His ungovernable rages, delusions of grandeur, messianic claims, and dictatorial impulses had all become more extreme; but these violent excesses were not the only symptoms of his curious mental and moral decline. He had lost his shrewd appreciation of realities. His sense of direction was confused in his purposes were equivocal. He showed, at intervals, a cynical selfishness and the ruthless cupidity.... although in public he professed that his sole aim was the redress of the Métis grievances, and private he was quite ready to promise that if the government made him a satisfactory personal payment of a few thousand dollars he would induce his credulous followers to accept almost any settlement the federal authorities desired, and would quietly leave Canada forever.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Creighton, ''Canada's First Century: 1867-1967'' (1970) p 54&lt;/ref&gt;

While Riel awaited news from Ottawa he considered returning to Montana, but had by February resolved to stay. Without a productive course of action, Riel began to engage in obsessive prayer, and was experiencing a significant relapse of his mental agitations. This led to a deterioration in his relationship with the Catholic hierarchy, as he publicly espoused an increasingly [[Christian heresy|heretical]] doctrine. On 11 February 1885, a response to the petition was received. The government proposed to take a census of the North-West Territories, and to form a commission to investigate grievances. This angered a faction of the Métis who saw it as a mere delaying tactic; they favoured taking up arms at once. Riel became the leader of this faction, but he lost the support of almost all Anglophones and [[Anglo-Métis]], the Catholic Church, and the great majority of Indians.  He also lost the support of the Métis faction supporting local leader [[Charles Nolin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |first=Diane P. |last=Payment

}}&lt;/ref&gt; became increasingly supportive of this course of action. In the church at Saint-Laurent on 15 March, Riel disrupted a sermon to argue for this position, following which he was barred from receiving the sacraments. He took more and more about his "divine revelations". But disenchanted with the status quo, and swayed by Riel's charisma and eloquent rhetoric, hundreds of Métis remained loyal to Riel, despite his proclamations that Bishop [[Ignace Bourget]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At his trial, Riel denied allegations that his religious beliefs were as irrational as was being (and continue to be) alleged.  He explained as follows:

"I wish to leave Rome aside, inasmuch as it is the cause of division between Catholics and Protestants. I did not wish to force my views...If I could have any influence in the new world it would be to help in that way, even if it takes 200 years to become practical...so my children's children can shake hands with the Protestants of the new world in a friendly manner.

===Open rebellion===
On 18 March it became known that the [[North-West Mounted Police]] garrison at Battleford was being reinforced. Although only 100 men had been sent in response to warnings from father [[Alexis André]] and NWMP superintendent [[Leif Newry Fitzroy Crozier|L.N.F. Crozier]], a rumour soon began to circulate that 500 heavily armed troops were advancing on the territory. Métis patience was exhausted, and Riel's followers seized arms, took hostages, and cut the telegraph lines between Batoche and Battleford. The [[Provisional Government of Saskatchewan]] was declared at Batoche on 19 March, with Riel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Louis Riel: A Brief Chronology | url = http://www.lackenbauer.ca/Hist103/Louis%20Riel%20-%20chronology%20outline%20for%20103.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 24 September 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025003758/http://www.lackenbauer.ca/Hist103/Louis%20Riel%20-%20chronology%20outline%20for%20103.pdf | archivedate = 25 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the political and spiritual leader and with Dumont assuming responsibility for military affairs.

The situation was becoming critical, and on 23 March Dewdney sent a telegraph to Macdonald indicating that military intervention might be necessary. Scouting near Duck Lake on 26 March, a force led by [[Gabriel Dumont (Métis leader)|Gabriel Dumont]] unexpectedly chanced upon a party from Fort Carlton. In the ensuing [[Battle of Duck Lake]], the police were routed, and the Natives also rose up once the news became known. The die was cast for a violent outcome, and the [[North-West Rebellion]] was begun in earnest.

[[Image:Louis Riel prison.jpg|thumb|left|Louis Riel imprisoned in Middleton's camp at Batoche, 16 May 1885]]
Riel had counted on the Canadian government being unable to effectively respond to another uprising in the distant [[North-West Territories]], thereby forcing them to accept political negotiation. This was essentially the same strategy that had worked to such great effect during the 1870 rebellion. In that instance, the first troops did not arrive until three months after Riel seized control. However, Riel had completely overlooked the significance of the  [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. Despite some uncompleted gaps, the first Canadian regular and militia units, under the command of [[Major-General]] [[Frederick Dobson Middleton]], arrived in Duck Lake less than two weeks after Riel had made his demands.

Knowing that he could not defeat the Canadians in direct confrontation, Dumont had hoped to force the Canadians to negotiate by engaging in a long-drawn out campaign of [[guerrilla warfare]]; Dumont realised a modest success along these lines at the [[Battle of Fish Creek]] on 24 April 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Trial for treason==
{{Main|Trial of Louis Riel}}
Several individuals closely tied to the government requested that the trial be held in Winnipeg in July 1885. Some historians contend that the trial was moved to Regina because of concerns with the possibility of an ethnically mixed and sympathetic jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Basson|first=Lauren L.|title=White enough to be American?|year=2008|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0-8078-5837-4|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Flanagan (political scientist)|Tom Flanagan]] states that an amendment of the [[North-West Territories Act]] (which dropped the provision that trials with crimes punishable by death should be tried in Manitoba) meant that the trial could be convened within the North-West Territories and did not have to be held in Winnipeg. [[Image:RielAtTrial.jpg|thumb|300px|Louis Riel testifies at his trial]]

Prime Minister Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] ordered the trial to be convened in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], where Riel was tried before a jury of six English and Scottish Protestants, all from the area surrounding the city. The trial began on 28 July 1885, and lasted five days.&lt;ref name="martyr"/&gt;  Riel delivered two long speeches during his trial, defending his own actions and affirming the rights of the Métis people. He rejected his lawyer's attempt to argue that he was [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]], asserting,

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The jury found him guilty but recommended mercy; nonetheless, Judge [[Hugh Richardson (magistrate)|Hugh Richardson]] sentenced him to death, with the date of his execution initially set for 18 September 1885.&lt;ref name="trial"/&gt; "We tried Riel for treason," one juror later said, "And he was hanged for the murder of Scott." &lt;ref&gt;George F.G. Stanley, ''Louis Riel: Patriot or Rebel?'' (1979) p 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
Boulton writes in his memoirs that, as the date of his execution approached, Riel regretted his opposition to the defence of insanity and vainly attempted to provide evidence that he was not sane. Requests for a retrial and an appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain were denied.  Sir John A. Macdonald, who was instrumental in upholding Riel's sentence, is famously quoted as saying:

Before his execution, Riel was reconciled with the Catholic Church, and assigned Father André as his spiritual advisor. He was also given writing materials so that he could employ his time in prison to write a book. &lt;!--I do not believe that was the intent – even his mail was read --&gt; Louis Riel was [[hanging|hanged]] for treason on 16 November 1885 at the North-West Mounted Police barracks in Regina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:LouisRielTombstone.jpg|right|thumb|Riel's tombstone at the St. Boniface Cathedral in Winnipeg.]]
Boulton writes of Riel's final moments,

::... Père André, after explaining to Riel that the end was at hand, asked him if he was at peace with men. Riel answered ''"Yes."'' The next question was, ''"Do you forgive all your enemies?"'' ''"Yes."'' Riel then asked him if he might speak. Father André advised him not to do so. He then received the kiss of peace from both the priests, and Father André exclaimed in French, "{{lang|fr|Alors, allez au ciel!}}" meaning "so, to heaven!"

::&amp;nbsp;... [Riel's] last words were to say good-bye to Dr. Jukes and thank him for his kindness, and just before the white cap was pulled over his face he said, "{{lang|fr|Remerciez Madame Forget.}}" meaning "thank Ms. Forget".

::The cap was pulled down, and while he was praying the trap was pulled. Death was not instantaneous. Louis Riel's pulse ceased four minutes after the trap-door fell and during that time the rope around his neck slowly strangled and choked him to death. The body was to have been interred inside the gallows' enclosure, and the grave was commenced, but an order came from the Lieutenant-Governor to hand the body over to Sheriff Chapleau which was accordingly done that night.&lt;ref&gt;Boulton (1886), Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the execution, Riel's body was returned to his mother's home in [[St. Vital, Manitoba|St. Vital]], where it lay in state. On 12 December 1886, his remains were laid in the churchyard of the [[Saint-Boniface Cathedral]] following the celebration of a [[requiem mass]].

The trial and execution of Riel caused a bitter and prolonged reaction which convulsed Canadian politics for decades. The execution was both supported and opposed by the provinces.  For example, Ontario (conservative) strongly supported Riel's execution, but Quebec was vehemently opposed to it.  Francophones were upset Riel was hung because they thought his execution was a symbol of English dominance.   The Orange Irish Protestant element in Ontario had demanded the execution as the punishment for Riel's treason and his execution of Thomas Scott in 1870. With their revenge satisfied, the Orange turned their attention to other matters (especially the [[Jesuit Estates Act|Jesuit Estates]] proposal). In Quebec there was no forgetting, and the politician [[Honoré Mercier]] rose to power by mobilizing the opposition in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roderick Stewart|title=Wilfrid Laurier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plolT8d2TWYC&amp;pg=PA156|year=2002|publisher=Dundurn|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Writings of Louis Riel.jpg|thumb|Collected writings of Riel]]
Riel remains controversial.  J. M. Bumsted in 2000 said that for Manitoba historian James Jackson, the murder of Scott – "perhaps the result of Riel's incipient madness – was the great blemish on Riel's achievement, depriving him of his proper role as the father of Manitoba."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. M. Bumsted|title=Thomas Scott's Body: And Other Essays on Early Manitoba History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dGPa9ywV9ZIC&amp;pg=PA17|year=2000|publisher=Univ. of Manitoba Press|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
The Saskatchewan Métis' requested land grants were all provided by the government by the end of 1887, and the government resurveyed the Métis river lots in accordance with their wishes. The Métis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel's worst fears were realised—following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the [[Manitoba Schools Question]]. The Métis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in the shadow of [[Indian reserve]]s (as they did not themselves have treaty status). Saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905.

Riel's execution and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec, and led to a fundamental alteration in the Canadian political order.&lt;ref&gt;Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians: 1760-1967'' (1968) 1:416-23&lt;/ref&gt; In Quebec, [[Honoré Mercier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; exploited the discontent to reconstitute the [[Parti National]]. This party, which promoted [[Quebec nationalism]], won a majority in the [[1886 Quebec election]] by winning a number of seats formerly controlled by the [[Conservative Party of Quebec (historical)|Quebec Conservative Party]]. The [[Canadian federal election, 1887|federal election of 1887]] likewise saw significant gains by the federal Liberals, again at the expense of the Conservatives. This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1896|federal election of 1896]], which in turn set the stage for the domination of Canadian federal politics by the Liberal party in the 20th century.

==Revoking Riel's conviction==
That Riel's name still has resonance in Canadian politics was evidenced on 16 November 1994, when [[Suzanne Tremblay]], a [[Bloc Québécois]] member of parliament, introduced [[Private Member's Bill|private members' bill]] C-228, "An Act to revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Historiography===
Historians have debated the Riel case so often and so passionately that he is the most written-about person in all of Canadian history.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Owram, ed., ''Canadian History: A Reader's Guide: vol. 2, Confederation to the Present'' (1994) p 18&lt;/ref&gt;   Interpretations have varied dramatically over time. The first amateur English language histories hailed the triumph of civilization, represented by English-speaking Protestants, over savagery represented by the half-breed Métis who were Catholic and spoke French. Riel was portrayed as an insane traitor and an obstacle to the expansion of Canada to the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=R. Douglas Francis|author2=Richard Jones|author3=Donald B. Smith|title=Journeys: A History of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GbbZRIOKclsC&amp;pg=PA306|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|pages=306–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. N. Sprague, ''Canada and the Métis, 1869-1885'' (1988) p 1&lt;/ref&gt;   By the mid-20th century academic historians had  dropped the theme of savagery versus civilization, deemphasized the Métis, and focused on Riel, presenting his execution as a major cause of the bitter division in Canada along  ethnocultural and geographical lines of religion and language. [[W. L. Morton]] says of the execution:
:[It] gave rise to a bitter and prolonged reaction which convulsed the course of national politics for the next decade. In Ontario it had been demanded and applauded by the Orange element as the punishment of treason and a vindication of loyalty. In Quebec Riel was defended, despite his apostasy and megalomania, as the symbol, indeed as a hero of his race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Lewis Morton|title=The Kingdom of Canada: A General History from Earliest Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MABVPAAACAAJ|year=1963|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton argued that Riel's demands were unrealistic:
:[They] did touch on some real grievances,  such as the need for increased representation of the people in the Council of the Territories, but they did not present a program of practical substance which the government might have granted without betrayal of its responsibilities....the Canadian government can hardly be blamed for refusing to continue its private negotiations with him, or for sending in the troops to suppress rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Morton|title=The Kingdom of Canada|year=1963|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic bishops had originally supported the Métis, but reversed themselves when they realized that Riel was leading a heretical movement. They made sure that he was not honored as a martyr.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Perin, ''Rome in Canada: The Vatican and Canadian Affairs in the Late Victorian Age'' (1990) p 259&lt;/ref&gt;  However the bishops lost their influence during the [[Quiet Revolution]], and activists in Québec found in Riel the perfect hero, with the image now of a freedom fighter who stood up for his people against an oppressive government in the face of widespread racist bigotry. His insanity was ignored and he was made a folk hero by the Francophones, the Catholic nationalists, the native rights movement, and the [[New Left]] student movement. Activists who espoused violence embraced his image; in the 1960s, the Quebec terrorist group, the [[Front de libération du Québec]] adopted the name "Louis Riel" for one of its [[terrorist cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Saywell, ed., ''Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs: 1971'' (1973) p 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Across Canada there emerged a new interpretation of reality in his rebellion, holding that the Métis had major unresolved grievances; that the government was indeed unresponsive; that Riel resorted to violence only as a last resort; and he was given a questionable trial, then executed by a vengeful government.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Flanagan, ''Riel and the Rebellion: 1885 Reconsidered'' (2000) p. x&lt;/ref&gt;  John Foster said in 1985 that:
:the interpretive drift of the last half-century...has witnessed increasingly shrill though frequently uncritical condemnations of Canadian government culpability and equally uncritical identification with the "victimization" of the "innocent" Métis.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Foster,  "Review of Riel and the Rebellion 1885 Reconsidered By Thomas Flanagan." ''Great Plains Quarterly'' (1985) 5#4 pp. 259-60 [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/greatplainsquarterly/1835/ online].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a leading specialist [[Tom Flanagan (political scientist)|Thomas Flanagan]] reversed his views after editing Riel's writings:
:As I sifted the evidence this became less and less convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; that the government was on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; that Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Flanagan, ''Riel and the Rebellion: 1885 Reconsidered'' (2nd ed. U of Toronto Press, 2000). p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the insanity, historians have noted that many religious leaders the past have exhibited behavior that looks exactly like insanity. Flanigan emphasizes that Riel exemplified the tradition of religious mystics involved in politics, especially those with a sense that the world was about to be totally transformed by their religious vision. In his case it meant his delivering the Métis from colonial domination. More broadly, Flanagan argues that Riel was devoutly religious and rejected equalitarianism (which he equated with secularism), concluding he was "a millenarian theocrat, sympathetic to the 'ancien régime' and opposed to the French Revolution, democracy, individualism, and secular society."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Flanagan, "Louis Riel: Icon of the Left," ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada'' (1986), Vol 1, pp 219-228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Mossmann, "The Charismatic Pattern: Canada's Riel Rebellion of 1885 as a Millenarian Protest Movement," ''Prairie Forum'' (1985) 10#2 pp 307-325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Métis scholars have noted that Riel is a more important figure to non-Métis than to Métis; he is the only Métis figure most non-Métis are aware of. Political scientists such as [[Thomas Flanagan (political scientist)|Thomas Flanagan]] have pointed out certain parallels between Riel's following during the North-West Rebellion and [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] cults.

It was unveiled in 1970 and stood in the grounds of the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba]] for 23 years. After much outcry (especially from the Métis community) that the statue was an undignified misrepresentation, the statue was removed and placed at the [[Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface]]. It was replaced in 1994 with a statue designed by [[Miguel Joyal]] depicting Riel as a dignified statesman. The unveiling ceremony was on 16 May 1996, in Winnipeg.&lt;ref name="proceeedings"/&gt;

In numerous communities across Canada, Riel is commemorated in the names of streets, schools, neighbourhoods, and other buildings. Examples in Winnipeg include the landmark [[Esplanade Riel]] pedestrian bridge linking Old Saint-Boniface with Winnipeg, the [[Louis Riel School Division]], Louis Riel Avenue in Old Saint-Boniface, and Riel Avenue in [[St. Vital, Winnipeg|St. Vital]]'s [[Minnetonka, Winnipeg|Minnetonka]] neighbourhood (which is sometimes called Riel).

In the spring of 2008, the [[Government of Saskatchewan]] Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake that "the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Arts, literature and popular culture===
In 1925, the French writer [[Maurice Constantin-Weyer]] who lived 10 years in [[Manitoba]] published in French a fictionalized biography of Louis Riel titled ''La Bourrasque''. An English translation/adaptation was published in 1930 : ''A Martyr's Folly'' (Toronto, The Macmillan Company), and a new version in 1954, ''The Half-Breed'' (New York, The Macaulay Compagny).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec |url=http://services.banq.qc.ca/sdx/dalfan/document.xsp?app=ca.bnquebec.sdx.dalfan&amp;db=DALFAN&amp;id=0392&amp;qid=sdx_q0&amp;n=115&amp;q= |title=Dictionnaire des auteurs de langue française en Amérique du Nord – Affichage de la notice du document |publisher=Services.banq.qc.ca |date=|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940 film ''[[North West Mounted Police]]'' Riel is portrayed by ''[[Francis McDonald]]''.
 
An opera about Riel entitled ''[[Louis Riel (opera)|Louis Riel]]'' was commissioned for [[Canadian Centennial|Canada's centennial]] celebrations in 1967. It was an opera in three acts, written by [[Harry Somers]], with an English and French [[libretto]] by [[Mavor Moore]] and [[Jacques Languirand]]. The [[Canadian Opera Company]] produced and performed the first run of the opera in September and October 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

From the late 1960s until the early 1990s, the city of [[Saskatoon]] hosted "Louis Riel Day", a summer celebration that included a relay race that combined running, backpack carrying, [[canoeing]], hill climbing, and [[horseback riding]] along the [[South Saskatchewan River]] in the city's downtown core. Traditionally, the event also included a [[cabbage roll]] eating contest and [[tug-of-war]] competition, as well as live musical performances. Although not affiliated with the Saskatoon Exhibition, for years Louis Riel Day was scheduled for the day before the start of the fair, and as such came to be considered the Exhibition's unofficial kick-off (the scheduling of the two events was separated in later years). The event was discontinued when major sponsors pulled out.

[[Billy Childish]] wrote a song entitled "Louis Riel", which was performed by [[Thee Headcoats]]. Texas musician [[Doug Sahm]] wrote a song entitled "Louis Riel," which appeared on the album ''S.D.Q. '98''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gourds.org/sahm2.html |title=Discography |publisher=Gourds.org |date= |accessdate=10 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016005503/http://www.gourds.org/sahm2.html# |archive-date=16 October 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the song, Sahm likens the lore surrounding Riel to David Crockett's legend in his home state, spinning an abridged tale of Riel's life as a revolutionary: "...but you gotta respect him for what he thought was right... And all around Regina they talk about him still – why did they have to kill Louis Riel?"&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r536633|pure_url=yes}} Album review] by [[Eugene Chadbourne]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seattle-based Indie rock band [[Grand Archives]] also wrote a song entitled "Louis Riel" that appears on their 2008 [[The Grand Archives|self-titled album]].

A track entitled ''Snowin' Today: A Lament for Louis Riel'' appears on the 2009 album ''Live: Two Nights In March'' by Saskatchewan singer/guitarist Little Miss Higgins; a studio version features on her 2010 release ''Across The Plains''.

On 22 October 2003, the Canadian news channel [[CBC Newsworld]] and its French-language equivalent, [[Réseau de l'information]], staged a simulated retrial of Riel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Also on the basis of a public poll, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC's]] ''[[The Greatest Canadian|Greatest Canadian]]'' project ranked Riel as the 11th "Greatest Canadian".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

An episode of the TV-series ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)|How the West Was Won]]'' from 1979 was named ''L'Affaire Riel'', featuring Louis Riel while in exile in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the West Was Won, Affaire Riel, L|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0606121/|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Canadian sketch comedy troupe [[Royal Canadian Air Farce]] featured Riel in its send-up of the CBC documentary series ''Canada: A People's History.'' Significant parallels were drawn between Riel's actions and those of modern-day Québécois separatists, and the comedian who portrayed Riel was made up to look like then-Premier [[Lucien Bouchard]].

In [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', part of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', '''Malebolge''' ({{IPAc-en|m|æ|l|ˈ|b|oʊ|l|dʒ}}) is the eighth circle of [[Hell]]. Roughly translated from [[Italian language|Italian]], Malebolge means "evil ditches". Malebolge is a large, funnel-shaped cavern, itself divided into ten concentric circular trenches or ditches. Each trench is called a ''bolgia'' (Italian for "pouch" or "ditch"). Long causeway bridges run from the outer circumference of Malebolge to its center, pictured as spokes on a wheel. At the center of Malebolge is the ninth and final circle of hell.  

==Overview==
In Dante’s version of hell, categories of [[sin]] are punished in different circles, with the depth of the circle (and placement within that circle) symbolic of the amount of punishment to be inflicted. Sinners placed in the upper circles of hell are given relatively minor punishments, while sinners in the depths of hell endure far greater torments. As the eighth of nine circles, Malebolge is one of the worst places in hell to be. In it, sinners guilty of "simple" fraud are punished (that is, fraud that is committed without particularly malicious intent, whereas Malicious or "compound" fraud—fraud which goes against bond of love, blood, honor, or the bond of hospitality—would be punished in the ninth circle). Sinners of this category include counterfeiters, hypocrites, grafters, seducers, sorcerers and [[simony|simonists]].

Dante and his guide, [[Virgil]], make their way into Malebolge by riding on the back of the monster [[Geryon]], the personification of fraud, who possesses the face of an honest man 'good of cheer,' but the tail of a scorpion, who flies them down through the yawning chasm that separates the eighth circle from the seventh circle, where the violent are punished. Dante and Virgil plan on crossing Malebolge by way of the system of bridges, but find their path disturbed by many broken ledges and collapsed bridges that were destroyed during the [[Harrowing of Hell]]. They must then cross some of the bolgias on foot and even rely on [[demon]]s to guide them. Eventually, they make it to the inner ledge where after a brief look at the [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], the babbling [[Nimrod]] to the hostile [[Aloadae|Ephialtes]] and heavily chained [[Hecatonchires|Briareus]], Virgil convinces the giant [[Antaeus]] to lower them down to the ninth circle's frozen lake, [[Cocytus]].

== The Malebranche ==

[[File:Gustave Dore Inferno Canto 21.jpg|200 px|thumb|The Malebranche threaten Virgil and Dante in the fifth Bolgia, portrayed by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

{{Main|Malebranche (Divine Comedy)}}

Thirteen demons known as the [[Malebranche (Divine Comedy)|Malebranche]], "Evil Claws", guard the fifth bolgia of the Malebolge. Their leader is [[Malacoda]] ("evil tail"), while the others are [[Scarmiglione]] ("ruffle-haired"), Barbariccia ("curly beard"), [[Alichino (devil)|Alichino]] (derived from Arlecchino, the harlequin), [[Calcabrina]] ("one who walks on the frost"), Cagnazzo ("bad dog"), Libicocco (a possible mix of ''[[libeccio]]'' and ''[[sirocco]]''), Draghignazzo (maybe from ''drago'', "dragon", and ''sghignazzo'', "guffaw"), Ciriatto (possibly "little pork"), Graffiacane ("scratch dog"), Farfarello (possibly "goblin") and Rubicante (possibly "red" or "rabid"). One of the thirteen was thus not named. They try to trick Virgil and Dante by telling them of a path which does not really exist.

==The Ten Bolgias==

The ten ditches of the Malebolge, in descending order, are listed thus:

'''Bolgia One:''' Panderers and Seducers are punished here. They are forced to march, single file around the circumference of their circle, constantly lashed by horned demons.

'''Bolgia Two:''' Sinners guilty of excessive flattery are punished in this bolgia, immersed forever in a river of human excrement, similar to what their flatteries were. 

'''Bolgia Three:''' Simoniacs (sinners guilty of selling church offices for personal gain) are punished here. They are turned upside down in large baptismal fonts cut into the rock, with their feet set ablaze by oily fires. The heat of the flames burns according to the guilt of the sinner.

'''Bolgia Four:''' Astrologers, seers, sorcerers and others who attempted to pervert [[God]]’s laws to divine the future are punished here. Their heads have been twisted around to face backwards, and thus they are forced to walk backwards around the circumference of their circle for all eternity.

'''Bolgia Five:''' Grafters (speculators, extortionists, blackmailers and unscrupulous businessmen: sinners who used their positions in life to gain personal wealth or other advantages for themselves) are punished by being thrown into a river of boiling pitch and [[tar]]. In addition, should any of the grafters try to escape the pitch, a horde of demons ("Malebranche", meaning "evil claws") armed with grappling hooks and barbs stands guard over them, ready to tear them to pieces. 

'''Bolgia Six:''' Hypocrites are punished in this circle. They are forced to wear heavy lead robes as they walk around the circumference of their circle. The robes are golden and resemble a monk’s cowl but are lined with heavy lead, symbolically representing hypocrisy. Also, [[Caiaphas]], the [[Pharisee]] who insisted on the execution of [[Jesus]], is crucified in this circle, staked to the ground so that the ranks of the lead-weighted hypocrites march across him.

'''Bolgia Seven:''' This bolgia houses the souls of thieves. The bolgia is also filled with [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]], [[dragon]]s and other vengeful reptiles that torture the thieves endlessly. The bites of some of the snakes cause the thieves to spontaneously combust, only to regenerate their bodies for further torment in a few moments. They are pursued by the monstrous fiery [[Cacus]]. Other thieves are denied human forms and appear as reptiles themselves, and can only assume their true shape if they steal a human shape from another sinner; this involves a very painful transformation for both [[soul]]s involved. 

'''Bolgia Eight:''' In this trench, the souls of Deceivers who gave false or corrupted advice to others for personal benefit are punished. They are constantly ablaze, appearing as nothing so much as living, speaking tongues of flame.

'''Bolgia Nine:''' Sinners who, in life, promoted scandals, schism, and discord are punished here; particularly those who caused schism within the church or within politics. They are forced to walk around the circumference of the circle bearing horrible, disfiguring wounds inflicted on them by a great demon with a sword. The nature of the wound mirrors the sins of the particular soul; while some only have gashes, or fingers and toes cut off, others are decapitated, cut in half (as schismatics), or are completely disemboweled. Among those who are tormented here is [[Bertran de Born]], who carries around his severed head like a lantern. 

'''Bolgia Ten:''' Falsifiers, those who attempted to alter things through lies or [[alchemy]], or those who tried to pass off false things as real things, such as counterfeiters of coins, are punished here. This bolgia has four subdivisions where specific classes of falsifiers (alchemists, impostors, counterfeiters, and liars) endure different degrees of punishment based on horrible, consumptive diseases such as [[rash|rashes]], [[dropsy]], [[leprosy]] and [[tuberculosis|consumption]].

The lower edge of Malebolge is guarded by a ring of titans and earth giants, many of whom are chained in place as punishment for their rebellion against God. Beyond and below the giants lies Cocytus, hell's final depth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15371">[[Image:Metropolitan of Moscow Makariy Nevskiy.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Macarius II]], [[Metropolitan of Moscow]]. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] a white [[klobuk]] is distinctive of a metropolitan.]]

In [[Christian]] churches with [[episcopal polity]], the rank of '''metropolitan bishop''', or simply '''metropolitan''', pertains to the [[diocesan bishop]] or [[archbishop]] of a [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]].

Originally, the term referred to the bishop of the chief city of a historical [[Roman province]], whose authority in relation to the other bishops of the province was recognized by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (AD 325).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.vii.vi.v.html First Council of Nicaea, canon IV]&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop of the provincial capital, the metropolitan, enjoyed certain rights over other bishops in the province, later called [[suffragan bishop]]s.&lt;ref name="ODCC self"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Metropolitan |editor-last1=Cross |editor-first1=F. L. |editor-last2=Livingstone |editor-first2=E. A. |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-192-80290-3 |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192802903.001.0001/acref-9780192802903-e-4518?rskey=rD3E8o&amp;result=4514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is applied in a similar sense to the bishop of the chief [[episcopal see]] (the "metropolitan see") of an [[ecclesiastical province]]. The head of such a metropolitan see has the rank of [[archbishop]] and is therefore called the '''metropolitan archbishop''' of the ecclesiastical province. Metropolitan (arch)bishops preside over [[synod]]s of the bishops of their ecclesiastical province, and are granted special [[Privilege (canon law)|privilege]]s by [[canon law]] and tradition.

In some churches, such as the [[Church of Greece]], a metropolis is a rank granted to all episcopal sees. Their bishops are all called metropolitans, the title of archbishop being reserved for the [[primate (bishop)|primate]].

[[File:Archbishop Daniel Dinardo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cardinal [[Daniel DiNardo]] is the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston|Metropolitan Archbishop of Galveston-Houston]]. In the Catholic Church, the [[pallium]] is unique to a metropolitan bishop.]]

=== Latin Church ===
In the [[Latin Church]], an [[ecclesiastical province]], composed of several neighbouring dioceses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 431]&lt;/ref&gt; is headed by a metropolitan, the [[archbishop]] of the diocese designated by the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 435]&lt;/ref&gt; The other bishops are known as [[suffragan bishop]]s.

The metropolitan's powers over dioceses other than his own are normally limited to

# supervising observance of faith and ecclesiastical discipline and notifying the [[Supreme Pontiff]] of any abuses;
# carrying out, for reasons approved beforehand by the [[Holy See]], a canonical inspection that the suffragan bishop has neglected to perform;
# appointing a [[diocesan administrator]] if the college of consultors fails to elect an at least 35-year-old priest within eight days after the vacancy of the see becomes known;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 436 §1–2]&lt;/ref&gt; and
# serving as the default [[ecclesiastical court]] for [[appeal]]s from decisions of the tribunals of the suffragan bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Canon 1438 no. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The metropolitan also has the liturgical privilege of celebrating sacred functions throughout the province, as if he were a bishop in his own diocese, provided only that, if he celebrates in a cathedral church, the diocesan bishop has been informed beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 436 §3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The metropolitan is obliged to request the [[pallium]], a symbol of the power that, in communion with the Church of Rome, he possesses over his ecclesiastical province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 437]&lt;/ref&gt; This holds even if he had the pallium in another metropolitan see.
[[File:External Ornaments of a Metropolitan Archbishop.svg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of a Catholic Metropolitan Archbishop]]
It is the responsibility of the metropolitan, with the consent of the majority of the suffragan bishops, to call a provincial council, decide where to convene it, and determine the agenda. It is his prerogative to preside over the provincial council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 442]&lt;/ref&gt; No provincial council can be called if the metropolitan see is vacant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 440 §2]&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[Latin Rite]] metropolitans are [[archbishop]]s; however, some archbishops are not metropolitans, as there are a few instances where an [[archdiocese]] has no suffragans or is itself suffragan to another archdiocese. [[Titular bishop|Titular archbishops]] (i.e. ordained bishops who are given an honorary title to a now-defunct archdiocese; e.g. many Vatican officials and [[papal nuncio]]s and [[apostolic delegate]]s are titular archbishops) are never metropolitans.

As of April 2006, 508 archdioceses were headed by metropolitan archbishops, 27 archbishops lead an extant archdiocese, but were not metropolitans, and there were 89 titular archbishops. See also [[Catholic Church hierarchy]] for the distinctions.

=== Eastern Catholic ===
[[File:Lubomyr Husar.jpg|thumb|Lubomyr Husar, Major Archbishop emeritus of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]]]]

====Within Patriarchal or Major Archiepiscopal Churches====
In those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] that are headed by a [[patriarch]], metropolitans in charge of ecclesiastical provinces hold a position similar to that of metropolitans in the [[Latin Church]]. Among the differences is that Eastern Catholic metropolitans within the territory of the patriarchate are to be ordained and enthroned by the patriarch, who may also ordain and enthrone metropolitans of sees outside that territory that are part of his Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/la/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1.html#TITULUS_IV Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 86]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a metropolitan has the right to ordain and enthrone the bishops of his province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/la/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1.html#TITULUS_IV Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 133]&lt;/ref&gt; The metropolitan is to be commemorated in the [[liturgy|liturgies]] celebrated within his province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/la/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1.html#TITULUS_IV Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 135]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[major archbishop]] is defined as the metropolitan of a certain see who heads an autonomous Eastern Church not of patriarchal rank. The canon law of such a Church differs only slightly from that regarding a patriarchal Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/la/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1.html#TITULUS_V Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 151–154]&lt;/ref&gt; Within major archiepiscopal churches, there may be ecclesiastical provinces headed by metropolitan bishops.

====As Heads of their own Particular Churches====
There are also autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches consisting of a single province and headed by a metropolitan. Metropolitans of this kind are to obtain the [[pallium]] from the Pope as a sign of his metropolitan authority and of his Church's [[full communion]] with the Pope, and only after his investment with it can he convoke the Council of Hierarchs and ordain the bishops of his autonomous Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/la/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1.html#TITULUS_VI Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 156]&lt;/ref&gt; In his autonomous Church it is for him to ordain and enthrone bishops&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/la/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1.html#TITULUS_VI Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 159]&lt;/ref&gt; and his name is to be mentioned immediately after that of the Pope in the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/la/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1.html#TITULUS_VI Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 161]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Orthodox==
[[File:Mitropolit Vladimir Petersburg.jpg|thumb|270px|Metropolitan Vladimir of [[Saint Petersburg]] wearing the light blue [[mandyas]] of a [[Russian Orthodox]] metropolitan.]]
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, the title of metropolitan is used variously, in terms of rank and jurisdiction.

In terms of rank, in some Eastern Orthodox Churches metropolitans are ranked above archbishops in [[Order of precedence|precedence]], while in others that order is reversed. Primates of [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] Eastern Orthodox Churches below [[patriarch]]al rank are generally designated as archbishops. In the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]es, archbishops are ranked above metropolitans in [[Order of precedence|precedence]]. The reverse is true for some Slavic Orthodox Churches ([[Russian Orthodox]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox]]) and also for [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], where metropolitans rank above archbishops and the title can be used for important regional or historical [[Episcopal see|sees]].

In terms of jurisdiction, there are two basic types of metropolitans in Eastern Orthodox Church: real metropolitans, with actual jurisdiction over their [[ecclesiastical province]]s, and honorary metropolitans who are in fact just diocesan bishops with honorary title of metropolitan and no jurisdiction outside their own diocese.

Some Eastern Orthodox Churches have functioning metropolitans on the middle (regional) level of church administration. In [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] there are six regional metropolitans who are the chairmen of their respective synods of bishops, and have special duties and privileges. For example, [[Metropolis of Oltenia|Metropolitan of Oltenia]] has regional jurisdiction over four dioceses.

On the other hand, in some Eastern Orthodox Churches title of metropolitan is only honorary, with no special or additional jurisdiction. In [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], honorary title of metropolitan is given to diocesan bishops of some important historical sees (Article 14 of the Constitution of Serbian Orthodox Church).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.rs/eng/church|title=Constitution of the Serbian Orthodox Church|publisher=Serbian Orthodox Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, diocesan bishop of the [[Eparchy of Montenegro and the Littoral]] is given the honorary title of metropolitan, but without any jurisdiction over other diocesan bishops in [[Montenegro]]. Diocesan bishop of the [[Eparchy of Dabar-Bosnia]] is also given the honorary title of metropolitan, but without any jurisdiction over other diocesan bishops in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

Non-canonical Eastern Orthodox Churches generally use metropolitan title according to local traditions of usage in Churches from which they were split (see: [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpc.org.mk/English/mpc-today.asp |title=	
MOC today |publisher=Macedonian Orthodox Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oriental Orthodox==

===Malankara Churches===
[[File:His Holiness Baselios Mar Thoma Paulose II.jpg|thumb|right|His Holiness [[Baselios Mar Thoma Paulose II]], [[Catholicos of the East]] &amp; [[Malankara Metropolitan]]]]
Metropolitan is a title used by all oriental orthodox churches in Malankara.
[[Malankara Metropolitan]] was a legal title given to the head of the Malankara Syrian Church, aka Puthencoor (New Traditionalists) Syrian Christians, by the Government of [[Travancore]] and [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]] in South India. This title was awarded by a proclamation from the King of Travancore &amp; the King of Cochin to the legal head of the Malankara Syrian Church. The Supreme Court of India had authenticated the usage of this title by the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] in its verdict in the Malankara Church case.

[[Baselios Mar Thoma Paulose II]] was enthroned as Catholicos of the East and [[Malankara Metropolitan]] on 1 November 2010 at Parumala, Kerala. Under his see, the dioceses are further headed by  Diocesan Metropolitans.

In the [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]] which is based in India, the Metropolitan also known as the [[Mar Thoma (disambiguation)|Mar Thoma]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; is the primate and supreme head of the church who is entitled to special privileges and remains the ultimate authority over the synod.

==Anglican==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In the [[Anglican Communion]], a metropolitan is generally the head of an [[ecclesiastical province]] (or cluster of [[dioceses]]). In the few Anglican churches with multiple provinces headed by metropolitans (namely the [[Church of England]], the [[Church of Ireland]], the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], the [[Anglican Church of Australia]], and the [[Church of Nigeria]]), a metropolitan ranks immediately under the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] or senior metropolitan of the national church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anglican.ca/help/faq/ac-provinces/&lt;/ref&gt; Most metropolitans, but not all, are styled [[archbishop]]. In England, Ireland, and Australia, each province has a "metropolitical see" whose diocesan bishop is ''ex officio'' metropolitan (such as the Archbishops of Canterbury and Sydney), while in Canada metropolitans are elected by the provincial houses of bishops from among the sitting diocesans. Prior to 1970, however, the metropolitan of the [[Province of Rupert's Land]] was always the bishop of the [[Anglican Diocese of Rupert's Land|eponymous diocese]], centred on Winnipeg. (Since then, only one Bishop of Rupert's Land, [[Walter H. Jones (bishop)|Walter Jones]], has been elected metropolitan).

Although in his work always gives prominence to women (usually lesbians), rejects the label of ''lesbian novels'' since her books are not exclusive of LGTBI people. In the words of the author:

{{quote|I think that no author or author writes LGBT novel itself. They write romance novel, fantasy novel, intimate novel, science fiction novel whose plot reflects a homosexual character. I do not know what kind of world we live in that makes this type of books have a distinctive, as if they could only focus on a general public. What anger. As if it were a problem, a barrier, a badge. How squeaky.

In [[Jainism]] cosmology, the '''Nigoda''' is a realm existing in which the lowest forms of life reside in endless numbers, and without any hope of release by self-effort. [[Jain scriptures]] describe nigodas which are sub-microscopic creatures living in large clusters and having a very short life and are said to pervade each and every part of universe, even in tissues of plants and flesh of animals.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=109}} The Nigoda exists in contrast to the Supreme Abode, also located at the [[Siddhashila]] (top of the universe) where liberated souls exist in omnisciencent and eternal bliss. According to Jain tradition, it is said that when a human being rises to this state after death and achieves liberation (Moksha), another from the Nigoda is given the potential of self-effort and hope.

==Charactersitics==
The life in ''Nigoda'' is that of a sub-microscopic organism possessing only one sense, i.e., of touch.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=109}}

In [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], '''Ocnus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|k|n|ə|s}} or '''Bianor''' {{IPAc-en|b|aɪ|ˈ|eɪ|n|ə|r}} was a son of [[Manto (daughter of Tiresias)|Manto]] and [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus]], king of [[Alba Longa]]. He founded modern [[Mantua]] in honor of his mother.&lt;ref name=Abril&gt;{{cite book|last=Abril Cultural|title=Editora Victor CivitaDicionário de Mitologia Greco-Romana|year=1973|publisher=Editora Victor Civita|pages=134|language=pt |oclc=45781956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, he was the son or brother of [[Auletes]] and founded [[Felsina]] (modern [[Bologna]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]] X, 198&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Perusia]] or [[Cesena]].&lt;ref&gt;Serv. ad Virg. Ed. ix. 60, Aen. x. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocnus is thus a character or allegorical deity which personifies hesitation, frustration, delay and the wasting of time, thus symbolising the vicissitudes of human life consumed in unsuccessful efforts.&lt;ref name=Abril/&gt; He was condemned to spend eternity in the netherworld, weaving a rope of straw. As depicted in the picture by [[Polygnotos]], standing behind him is his donkey which eats the rope as fast as it is made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.washington.edu/fox/lib/ocnus1.jpg The picture by Polygnotos], University of Washington website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olapa''', [[goddess]] of the [[moon]], is married to Enkai ([[Ngai]]), [[God]] of the [[sun]] in [[Maasai mythology]]. 
== Mythology ==

The two fought one day, and Olapa, being a short tempered woman, inflicted Enkai with a wound. To hide his shame, he took to shining very brightly, so that no one could look straight at him. In revenge, Enkai hit Olapa back and struck out one of her eyes. This can be seen today, when the moon is full.
== Name ==

The word for moon and [[month]] (''olapa'') carries the masculine gender form 'ol' in the prefix.

'''''On Passions''''' ({{lang-el|Περὶ παθῶν}}; ''Peri pathōn''), also translated as '''''On Emotions''''' or '''''On Affections''''', is a work by the Greek [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Chrysippus]] dating from the 3rd-century BCE. The book has not survived intact, but around seventy fragments from the work survive in a polemic written against it in the 2nd-century CE by the philosopher-physician [[Galen]]. In addition [[Cicero]] summarises substantial portions of the work in his 1st-century BCE work ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]''. ''On Passions'' consisted of four books; of which the first three discussed the Stoic theory of emotions and the fourth book discussed therapy and had a separate title—''Therapeutics''. Most surviving quotations come from Books 1 and 4, although Galen also provides an account of Book 2 drawn from the 1st-century BCE Stoic philosopher [[Posidonius]]. Little or nothing is known about Book 3.

The Stoics believed that the mind was rational, and that emotions involve judgements. The [[Stoic passions]] are emotions such as fear, anger, and desire which cause suffering. In his ''On Passions'', Chrysippus explained how the passions arise from the mistaken opinions of what is good and bad. They are excessive and disobedient to reason, which Chrysippus compared to a runner who is out-of-control. A person in the grip of passion has rejected reason, and therapy is a medical art needed to treat the mind. The treatment outlined by Chrysippus was mostly preventative, demonstrating by theory that the passions are neither natural or necessary, and showing through practice that the mind can be trained to reject them. 

==Background==
[[File:Portrait of Chrysippus.jpg|thumb|Bust of Chrysippus, Uffizi Gallery, Florence]]
{{See also|Stoic passions}}
Stoicism is a school of philosophy which began in the 3rd-century BCE. The first head (''[[scholarch]]'') of the school, [[Zeno of Citium]], began teaching around 300 BCE, and laid down most of the fundamental doctrines of the school. His successors as head of the school were [[Cleanthes of Assos]] and then [[Chrysippus of Soli]]. The Stoics grounded their ethics in the belief that the world was rational, ordered, and structured.&lt;ref name="inwood683"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only by living according to nature (human nature and cosmic nature) can humans flourish.&lt;ref name="inwood686"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=686}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since nature is rational, only a life lived according to reason, i.e. according to virtue (''[[arete|aretē]]''), will allow for a life that is smooth, consistent and happy.&lt;ref name="inwood686"/&gt; Failure to reason correctly brings about the occurrence of ''pathē''—a word translated as passions, emotions, or affections.&lt;ref name="annas103"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tielman16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''pathos'' was a wide-ranging term indicating an infliction one suffers.&lt;ref name="annas103"/&gt; The Stoics used the word to discuss generic emotions such as anger, fear and joy.&lt;ref name="annas103"/&gt; The word passion is often used as a translation of ''pathos'' so as not to suggest that the Stoics wanted to be rid of all feeling.&lt;ref name="tielman15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Stoics were often talking straightforwardly about common emotions.&lt;ref name="annas104"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics beginning with Zeno arranged the passions under four headings: distress (''lupē''), pleasure (''hēdonē''), fear (''phobos'') and desire (''epithumia'').&lt;ref name="sorabji29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these (distress and pleasure) refer to passions currently present, and two of these (fear and desire) refer to passions directed at the future.&lt;ref name="sorabji29"/&gt; Under these four headings can be found specific emotions such as anger, longing, envy, grief, and pride.&lt;ref name="inwood700"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers from the time of [[Plato]] had allowed for irrational impulses in the soul, but the Stoics saw the soul as a unified rational whole with a central ruling centre (''hegemonikon'').&lt;ref name="annas115"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Stoics were the first philosophers to identify all emotions with judgements.&lt;ref name="sorabji20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A passion is a mistaken opinion.&lt;ref name="inwood699"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=699}}&lt;/ref&gt; A passion has a passive aspect in that it brings suffering, but it also has an active aspect which the Stoics saw as an impulse (''hormē''),&lt;ref name="tielman15"/&gt; one which is excessive and disobedient to reason.&lt;ref name="annas105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wise person who is free from the passions (''[[apatheia]]'') instead experiences good emotions (''eupatheia'') which are clear-headed feelings.&lt;ref name="inwood705"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was against this background that Chrysippus wrote his therapeutic work ''On Passions''. Cleanthes had maintained that to quell a passion such as fear, all one had to do was demonstrate that the emotion had nothing to do with what is bad.&lt;ref name="inwood713"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=713}}&lt;/ref&gt; However as a form of therapy this was inadequate, and Chrysippus set himself the task of writing a treatise on the theory and therapy of emotions.&lt;ref name="inwood713"/&gt;

==Sources==
The principal source for the ''On Passions'' is the polemical commentary by [[Galen]] in his ''On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato'' which contains most of the surviving quotations.&lt;ref name="tielman1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other main source is Cicero's ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'' Book IV which contains a discussion of the Stoic passions which is derived from Chrysippus.&lt;ref name="tielman1"/&gt; A small amount of supplementary information is provided by writers such as [[Diogenes Laërtius]], [[Stobaeus]], [[Calcidius]], and [[Origen]].&lt;ref name="tielman1"/&gt;

===Galen===
Galen quotes Chrysippus' ''On Passions'' around seventy times in his ''On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato'', thus preserving up to twenty percent of the text.&lt;ref name="tielman2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen wrote ''On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato'' to examine the main doctrines of [[Hippocrates]] and Plato and to demonstrate their truth and agreement (as Galen saw it).&lt;ref name="tielman21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato had divided the soul into three parts representing reason, anger, and appetite.&lt;ref name="tielman26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Chrysippus was the main representative of the Stoic view that the soul was unitary, Galen devotes most of the fourth and fifth books of his nine-volume treatise attacking the ''On Passions'' of Chrysippus.&lt;ref name="tielman30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galen maintains that most philosophers including [[Pythagoras]], [[Aristotle]] and even many Stoics agreed with Plato's division of the soul,&lt;ref name="tielman39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if some of them understood the division in terms of powers rather than as parts.&lt;ref name="tielman26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal is to show that Chrysippus represents a deviant position.&lt;ref name="tielman39"/&gt; He claims that Zeno and Cleanthes were really on Plato's side,&lt;ref name="sorabji101"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the evidence he presents is very meagre.&lt;ref name="tielman58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accepts he has little evidence for Zeno,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|pp=85-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only evidence he provides for Cleanthes is a brief versified dialogue between anger and reason which he thinks shows that Cleanthes accepted an irrational part of the soul.&lt;ref name="tielman56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his polemic, Galen draws heavily on the Stoic philosopher [[Posidonius]] (1st-century BCE) who wrote his own ''On Passions'' as a commentary on Chrysippus. Galen claims Posidonius accepted an irrational part of the soul,&lt;ref name="annas118"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Posidonius may have held a more Stoic position than Galen admits to.&lt;ref name="annas119"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen selects and quotes passages out of context,&lt;ref name="tielman57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he often shows incomprehension in his understanding of Chrysippus.&lt;ref name="annas119"/&gt;

===Cicero===
Cicero uses Chrysippus' ''On Passions'' as a major source for the fourth book of his ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes|Tusculan Disputations]]''.&lt;ref name="tielman288"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some passages in his third book are also drawn from the same source.&lt;ref name="tielman288"/&gt; Cicero may well have used an epitome made by a later Stoic rather than the full text.&lt;ref name="tielman288"/&gt; He provides extra details not mentioned by Galen, and is comparatively unbiased.&lt;ref name="tielman288"/&gt; However, there are no direct quotations from Chrysippus in Cicero's account; he mixes in material drawn from other philosophy schools; and he intersperses his own comments.&lt;ref name="tielman291"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cicero complains that Chrysippus devotes most of his efforts on theory and not therapy, but Cicero has a narrow definition of therapy: a strategy for helping someone in the sudden grip of emotion.&lt;ref name="tielman319"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero is nevertheless a useful source for the practical side of Chrysippus' therapy, and its focus on prevention.&lt;ref name="tielman319"/&gt; Galen neglects this aspect because his aim is to attack the theory.&lt;ref name="tielman318"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Although ''On Passions'' is one of the best attested works by Chrysippus, large sections of the work are lost.&lt;ref name="tielman2"/&gt; Galen appears to have only read, and made direct use of, Books 1 and 4.&lt;ref name="tielman123"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tielman140"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derives his account of Book 2 entirely from the commentary of Posidonius, and he is silent about Book 3.&lt;ref name="tielman55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tielman123"/&gt; The epitome used by Cicero may itself have been a summary of Books 1 and 4.&lt;ref name="tielman302"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that most of the surviving quotations are from Books 1 and 4 and our knowledge of Book 3 is non-existent.

Galen refers to the first three books as the theoretical books (''logika'').&lt;ref name="tielman90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Book 4 was known separately as the ''Therapeutics'' ({{lang-el|θεραπευτικόν}})—a title which apparently goes back to Chrysippus, and it had some status as a stand-alone text.&lt;ref name="tielman90"/&gt; In Book 1 Chrysippus discusses the definitions of passion which had been laid down by Zeno, and analyses its various types.&lt;ref name="tielman91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Book 2 he examines the difficulties raised by everyday experience.&lt;ref name="tielman91"/&gt; Book 4 treats the therapy of the passions, although it too contains theory, summarising some of the material from Book 1.&lt;ref name="tielman91"/&gt; Theory itself plays an important role in Stoic therapy.&lt;ref name="tielman92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book 1===
In Book 1 Chrysippus begins with the definitions of passion which had been laid down by Zeno.&lt;ref name="tielman96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno had written his own work ''On Passions'' which had examined emotions based on common opinions held about them.&lt;ref name="tielman99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno defined passion as "an irrational and unnatural motion of the soul" and "an excessive impulse".&lt;ref name="tielman97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus stresses that "irrational" here means "disobedient to reason and having turned away from reason."&lt;ref name="tielman97"/&gt; Acting emotionally is not being overcome by a lower non-rational part of the soul.&lt;ref name="annas116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus compares an excessive impulse to a runner whose legs have such impetus that the runner cannot immediately will them to a halt:&lt;ref name="tielman102"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|In walking according to impulse the movement of the legs is not excessive, but is in a sense coextensive with the impulse so that it can come to a standstill when he [the walker] wishes, or change direction. But in the case of those who are running according to impulse, this sort of thing is no longer the case. The movement of the legs exceeds the impulse, so that they are carried away and do not obediently change their pace the moment they set out to do so. I think something similar happens also in impulses because of an excess beyond the rational measure, so that when someone exercises the impulse that person is not obedient to reason; and whereas the excess in running is termed contrary to the impulse, the excess in impulse is termed contrary to reason.|Chrysippus, quoted by Galen.&lt;ref name="annas115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inwood702"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=702}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An excessive emotion is like a runner who is out-of-control because of external causes.&lt;ref name="annas116"/&gt; In the case of out-of-control mind the external causes are external appearances,&lt;ref name="annas116"/&gt; which when impressed upon a weakened mind result in a corresponding passion.&lt;ref name="tielman106"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeno, again borrowing from common usage, had added a third definition of passion as a "fluttering of the soul".&lt;ref name="tielman104"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Stoics all bodily processes have a material, corporeal cause,&lt;ref name="tielman103"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; which for Chrysippus as well as Zeno meant physical movements in the soul.&lt;ref name="tielman104"/&gt;

Having dealt with Zeno's three definitions of passion, Chrysippus passes on to the four generic passions as defined by Zeno.&lt;ref name="tielman114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno had defined distress as the opinion that one is in the presence of evil.&lt;ref name="tielman115"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of the distress is affected by the soul's resilience and the scale of the experience.&lt;ref name="tielman119"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus adds that the opinion needs to be fresh to explain why distress can fade with time.&lt;ref name="tielman115"/&gt; Chrysippus defines distress as a shrinking before what is thought to be a thing to avoid, and pleasure as a swelling at what is thought to be a thing to choose.&lt;ref name="tielman121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book 2===
In Book 2 Chrysippus moves beyond Zeno's definitions to discuss various problems concerning passions.&lt;ref name="tielman123"/&gt; For Chrysippus emotions are judgements: a judgement that something good or bad is at hand and that it is appropriate to act accordingly.&lt;ref name="sorabji93"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a passion consists of two propositions: (1) this is something good/bad and (2) it is right that one should be affected by it.&lt;ref name="inwood714"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=714}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of distress, people believe that (1) something bad has befallen them, and (2) that one should shrink before it, producing not only the inner pain but the outward signs of distress such as weeping.&lt;ref name="tielman124"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the distress diminishes which indicates a weakening of the second proposition, however the first proposition may remain in place.&lt;ref name="tielman125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one may stop mourning the death of a loved-one while still believing their death to be an evil.&lt;ref name="tielman125"/&gt; Chrysippus understands this in terms of abatement of inflammation, in much the same way a fever abates.&lt;ref name="tielman131"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics saw passions as a type of illness, so the medical analogy is deliberate.&lt;ref name="tielman132"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysippus acknowledges that some emotional responses are not easily reasoned out.&lt;ref name="tielman125"/&gt; For example it is possible that both judgements may be present but that the manifestations of distress do not ensue.&lt;ref name="tielman125"/&gt; Chrysippus explains this as being due to other causal factors acting which we may be unaware of or whose origin may be unclear.&lt;ref name="tielman126"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; This might include underlying characteristics of the mind, or the extent to which other errors have become entrenched in the mind.&lt;ref name="graver149"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|2002|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysippus also discusses the origin of evil, and why children, even those brought up virtuously, become corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|pp=132-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus relates this to his principle of [[oikeiôsis]].&lt;ref name="tielman138"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are born in a natural state which should lead to goodness and virtue.&lt;ref name="tielman138"/&gt; However, the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain become associated from an early age with the supreme good.&lt;ref name="tielman134"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar process occurs with wealth and fame.&lt;ref name="tielman135"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus physical factors such as pleasure and pain, as well as societal pressures, hamper our natural development.&lt;ref name="tielman138"/&gt; The Stoics equated evil with the passions,&lt;ref name="tielman132"/&gt; and corruption arises in regards to good and evil because of "the persuasiveness of appearances and conversation."&lt;ref name="tielman137"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book 4: ''Therapeutics''===
Chrysippus states near the beginning of Book 4 that just as there is an art called medicine concerned with the diseased body, so there is an equivalent art associated with the diseased mind.&lt;ref name="tielman144"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not just an analogy: a passion is a real illnesss brought on from the mind's deviation from its natural state.&lt;ref name="inwood712"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=712}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soul's condition depends on physiological processes in the body.&lt;ref name="tielman147"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus directly relates this to medical ideas concerning ''[[pneuma]]'' as the 'breath' that makes up the soul,&lt;ref name="tielman148"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a passion involves a disturbance in the balance of the [[classical element]]s which make up the body and between physical principles such as hot and cold.&lt;ref name="tielman155"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this material relationship between body and soul, Chrysippus emphasizes the need for bodily health, and advocates a plain, simple diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|pp=163-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysippus discusses the passions by quoting Greek literature. Thus in his examination of anger he makes use of Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'':&lt;ref name="annas117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Quote|I understand what evils I am about to do,&lt;br/&gt;
But anger (''[[thymos]]'') is stronger than my sound considerations|''Medea'' 1078–9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here Chrysippus explains Medea's anger in terms of ''[[akrasia]]'': a word meaning weak-will&lt;ref name="inwood699"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=699}}&lt;/ref&gt; or incontinence.&lt;ref name="tielman172"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Akrasia'' is not an irrational force within the soul,&lt;ref name="inwood699"/&gt; instead it is the mind identifying with a bad reason against one's better judgement.&lt;ref name="annas117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sorabji313"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; During emotional conflict reason oscillates between rival judgements.&lt;ref name="sorabji313"/&gt; Wrong reason will reside simultaneously in the mind with right reason.&lt;ref name="tielman172"/&gt; In Medea's case she chooses the option rooted in anger, which is thus wrong reason.&lt;ref name="tielman172"/&gt; Chrysippus once again explains this loss of control in terms of "runners who go counter to their impulse in running and [hence] in persons angered counter to their own reason."&lt;ref name="tielman173"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone in the midst of an emotional crisis rejects right reason and cannot be easily helped. Chrysippus gives many examples of anger and other emotions such as people biting keys and kicking a door when it fails to open, or taking out anger on inanimate objects such as balls of wool.&lt;ref name="annas117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tielman179"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a person will appear changed to those people around them (i.e. people still in possession of right reason) and they can not be treated as the person they normally are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|pp=173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly someone in the throes of love will reject good counsel whatever the price may be.&lt;ref name="tielman176"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may recognise right reason, yet they will reject it.&lt;ref name="tielman176"/&gt; The passions obscure, they cause a mental clouding, a madness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|pp=180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They put an end to deliberation, leaving just one option as irresistible.&lt;ref name="tielman181"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only recovery from this mental clouding permits deliberation and the return of right reason.&lt;ref name="tielman183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus describes two forms of treatment: (1) treating passions which have arisen, and (2) preventing passions from arising.&lt;ref name="inwood712"/&gt; Chrysippus stresses that the therapy of the first type has only limited value, to be used as temporary measure.&lt;ref name="tielman319"/&gt; 

{{Quote|For even in the case of distress, not every form is soothed by the same method: one remedy should be applied for grief, a different remedy for pity or envy. ... To be sure, all emotions of that sort could be washed away by that form of consolation which teaches that the circumstances which give rise to gladness or desire are not goods, and those which give rise to fear or distress are not evils. But the specific and more reliable cure is when you teach that the emotions are wrong in and of themselves and have nothing either natural or necessary about them.|''Tusculan Disputations'', iv. 59–60&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|2002|pp=60-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus his therapy is preventative.&lt;ref name="tielman319"/&gt; Since a passion is a temporary outbreak reflecting the diseased nature of the mind, therapy itself must be directed at the underlying disease.&lt;ref name="tielman319"/&gt; Chrysippus advocates the practice of 'dwelling in advance'—that is trying to foresee the numerous difficulties that life offers.&lt;ref name="tielman314"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus gives two reasons for the impact of unexpected events: (1) that we have no time to assess the magnitude of the event, and (2) that we feel guilty for not having anticipated it:&lt;ref name="tielman313"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Chrysippus is of the same view, I know: what is unforeseen strikes us with greater force. But there is more to it than that. It is true that a sudden assault of the enemy creates rather more confusion than an expected one, and that a sudden storm at sea strikes more fear into those on shipboard than if they had seen it coming, and there are many similar cases. But if you were to study such events carefully and scientifically, what you would find, quite simply, is that when things happen suddenly, they invariably seem more serious than they otherwise would. There are two reasons for this. First, there is not enough time to gauge the seriousness of what is happening. Second, we sometimes think that if we had foreseen what was to happen, we might have been able to prevent it, and then our distress is keener because compounded with guilt.|''Tusculan Disputations'', iii. 52&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|2002|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus the primary cause of distress is unforeseen events,&lt;ref name="tielman314"/&gt; and we need the ability to respond rationally instead of straight away assenting to appearances.&lt;ref name="annas117"/&gt; Chrysippean therapy focuses on contemplation; training and improving the mind; strengthening the soul.&lt;ref name="tielman319"/&gt; The theory teaches us that the passions are misguided judgements, and thus are voluntary.&lt;ref name="tielman320"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the task of therapy to teach that these judgements have a wrong valuation, mistaking indifferent things for good or evil.&lt;ref name="tielman320"/&gt;

==Cicero's ''Tusculan Disputations''==
[[File:Cicero - Tusculanae Disputationes illuminated manuscript.jpg|thumb|''Tusculan Disputations'', 15th-century illuminated manuscript]]
Cicero made use of ''On Passions'', probably in epitome form, for his ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes|Tusculan Disputations]]''.&lt;ref name="tielman288"/&gt; Most of his testimony can be found in the fourth book of the ''Tusculans'', especially the coherent section at §11–33 and a rather muddled section at §58–81. A few extra passages can be found in Cicero's third book.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}

===Book IV===
Apart from the introduction (§1–10) and the conclusion (§82–4), ''Tusculan Disputations'' Book 4 can be divided into three parts, two of which are derived from Chrysippus' ''On Passions''. The other part is a critique of the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] theory of moderate emotions at §34–57.&lt;ref name="tielman293"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Stoic, this central section is drawn from some other source.&lt;ref name="tielman305"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====§11–33====
This first section closely parallels Galen's account of Books 1 and 4 of ''On Passions''. Cicero begins (§11) with Zeno's first two definitions of emotion, and moves on to an overview of the four generic passions as well as the three good-feelings attributable to the Stoic Sage (§14).&lt;ref name="tielman298"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lists (§15) four physical effects of the four passions not found in Galen's account.&lt;ref name="tielman298"/&gt; He follows this (§16–21) with a lengthy catalogue of the emotions arranged under the headings of the four main passions—a list which is again missing from Galen.&lt;ref name="tielman300"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then (§22) highlights the concept of ''akrasia'' (Latin: ''intemperamentia'') as the source of the passions.&lt;ref name="tielman300"/&gt;

Cicero then (§23–32) moves on to material which is drawn from the ''Therapeutics''.&lt;ref name="tielman301"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins (§23) with a statement about how disturbances of the mind are like those of the body, and how the soul is disturbed by conflicting opinions. Cicero provides (§25–26) definitions and examples of the various passions. He explains (§27–28) the analogy between body and soul, and between disease and health. He describes (§31) the limitations of the analogy (a healthy soul cannot become diseased like a healthy body can); and explains (§32) how the clever are less prone to sickness.&lt;ref name="tielman301"/&gt;

====§58–81====
In this section Cicero returns to the subject of therapy. However, although much of the material is sourced from Chrysippus, Cicero interweaves some Peripatetic ideas; adds his own remarks; and sources his own quotations from the Latin poets.&lt;ref name="tielman305"/&gt;

After an introduction (§58), Cicero explains (§59–62) the Chrysippean position that one should direct treatment at the passion itself rather than the external cause.&lt;ref name="tielman305"/&gt; He then (§64–65) discusses passions caused by (supposedly) bad and good things respectively.&lt;ref name="tielman306"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero add his own digression on the opinions offered by different philosophers.&lt;ref name="tielman306"/&gt; He then (§68–76) moves on to the theme of erotic love.&lt;ref name="tielman306"/&gt; Many of these ideas come from Chrysippus, but Cicero uses examples drawn from Latin poetry instead of the Greek poets.&lt;ref name="tielman306"/&gt; The therapeutic ideas (§74–5) about introducing distractions or substituting a new lover for an old one are presumably part of Cicero's "Peripatetic" cures.&lt;ref name="tielman307"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next subject (§77–81) treats anger, again drawing his ideas from Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|pp=307-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book III===
Cicero's ''Tusculan Disputations'' Book 3 is focused on the alleviation of distress rather than the passions generally.&lt;ref name="tielman309"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero draws on many Stoic themes, some of which may be derived from Chrysippus. This includes a medical analogy (§1), and passions as forms of madness (§7–13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|pp=310-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a few passages can be directly attributed to ''On Passions''. Of particular value is §52 which contains the doctrine of dwelling in advance which is directly attributed to Chrysippus.&lt;ref name="tielman313"/&gt; This can be supplemented with §29 which contains a Euripides' quote probably used by Chrysippus on the same theme.&lt;ref name="tielman314"/&gt; Other Chrysippean passages include a derivation of the word distress (''lupē'') at §61,&lt;ref name="tielman315"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his therapy concerning mourning at §76 and §79.&lt;ref name="tielman317"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Chrysippus became a preeminent authority for the Stoic school, eclipsing his predecessors.&lt;ref name="tielman55"/&gt; Writers as doctrinally far-apart as [[Philodemus]] and [[Origen]] quote from his ''On Passions''.&lt;ref name="tielman140"/&gt; Galen himself states that the Stoics of his day followed Chrysippus.&lt;ref name="tielman55"/&gt;

===Posidonius===
[[Posidonius]] wrote his own ''On Passions'' expanding on the treatise of Chrysippus. Almost everything which is known about the work is drawn from Galen's remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|2002|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen claims Posidonius allowed for an irrational part of the soul.&lt;ref name="annas118"/&gt; It is possible Posidonius did hold this position although it would have been at variance with mainstream Stoic thought, not just that of Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|2002|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero, who had personally known Posidonius, shows no awareness of a disagreement between Posidonius and Chrysippus.&lt;ref name="tielman295"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the difficulties Posidonius wanted to explain were: how impulses become excessive; why different people vary in their emotional reactions; why emotions fade through time, yet judgements can remain intact; and why the manifestations of distress can be so unpredictable.&lt;ref name="sorabji98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases the disagreement which Galen reports between Posidonius and Chrysippus may in fact have been attempts by Posidonius to refine and corroborate the Stoic position of Chrysippus.&lt;ref name="tielman139"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tieleman|2003|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Posidonius wanted to explain variations in emotional reactions: why do some people react inappropriately in the face of an emotion and others do not?&lt;ref name="sorabji58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posidonius may have argued that human minds are predisposed to various emotional movements without necessarily being irrational.&lt;ref name="annas119"/&gt;

===Seneca===
The influence of Chrysippus on [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] is clearest in his long essay ''[[De Ira|On Anger]]'' ({{lang-la|De Ira}}). Seneca distinguishes three stages of anger as part of a chronological sequence.&lt;ref name="sorabji61"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage is shock, an initial agitation or movement which is involuntary.&lt;ref name="sorabji66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second stage the mind assents to appearance of injustice, and that it is thus appropriate to respond with vindictiveness. In the third stage the emotion is released.&lt;ref name="sorabji61"/&gt; Reason, which was still present in the second stage is now let go and the mind turns away from it.&lt;ref name="sorabji62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first stage is involuntary and the third stage lacks reason, therapy has to be directed at the second stage—only here can one recognise the nature of the shock and side with reason.&lt;ref name="sorabji69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epictetus===
[[Epictetus]] tells his students to train themselves in their use of appearances through a series of exercises.&lt;ref name="sorabji215"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes questioning whether a grand or beautiful passer-by involves something good, or whether a bereaved or hungry person has encountered something bad.&lt;ref name="sorabji330"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epictetus makes a sharp distinction between things in our power (''eph' hēmin'') and not in our power.&lt;ref name="sorabji214"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anything in our power is defined narrowly as our will or volition (''prohairesis'').&lt;ref name="sorabji215"/&gt; This includes our judgements and desires, but nothing external such as our bodies.&lt;ref name="sorabji215"/&gt; The influence of Chrysippus is obvious in a ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourse]]'' (ii. 18) on the correct use of impressions, where he explains how diseases grow in the mind in a manner very similar to a Chrysippean passage quoted by Cicero (''Tusc. Disp.'' iv. 24):&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|2002|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|It is in this way, of course, that moral infirmities grow up in the mind, as philosophers explain. For once you've come to feel a desire for money, if reason is brought to bear in such a way as to make us become aware of the evil, the desire will be suppressed and our ruling centre will be restored to its original authority; but if you apply no remedy, it won't return to its original state, but when it comes to be aroused again by the corresponding impression, it will become inflamed by desire more rapidly than before. And if this happens repeatedly, a callus will finally be formed, and the infirmity will cause the avarice to become entrenched.|Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii. 18. 8–9}}

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} Some older English translations of the ''Tusculan Disputations'' use a different numbering scheme for the sections. In these old texts the relevant parts of book IV, §11–33 and §58–81, are sections 6–14 and 27–37. For Book III, §29 and §52 are at sections 14 and 22. The other three passages §61, §76, §79 are at 25, 31, and 33.

'''Our Lady of Walsingham''' is a title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] venerated by [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Anglican]]s associated with the [[Marian apparition]]s to [[Richeldis de Faverches]], a pious [[English people|English]] noblewoman,  in 1061 in the village of [[Walsingham]] in [[Norfolk]], [[England]]. Lady Richeldis had a building structure named "The Holy House" built in Walsingham which later became a shrine and place of pilgrimage.

In passing on his guardianship of the Holy House, Richeldis's son Geoffrey left instructions for the building of a [[Walsingham Priory|priory in Walsingham]]. The priory passed into the care of the [[Canons Regular]] sometime between 1146 and 1174.

[[Pope Pius XII]] granted a [[canonical coronation]] to the Roman Catholic image via the [[Apostolic Nunciature to Great Britain|papal nuncio]], Bishop [[Gerald O'Hara]], on 15 August 1954 with a gold crown funded by her female devotees, now venerated in the [[Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Walsingham|Basilica of Our Lady of Walsingham]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walsingham.org.uk/home&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marian apparition==
[[File:All Saints Episcopal Church, Jensen Beach, Florida 010.jpg|thumb|A stained glass window featuring Our Lady of Walsingham. All Saints Episcopal Church, [[Jensen Beach, Florida]]]]
According to the reputed [[Marian apparition]] to Lady [[Richeldis]], the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] fetched her [[soul]] from [[England]] to [[Nazareth]] during a [[religious ecstasy]] to show the house where the [[Holy Family]] once lived and was then tasked to build an imitation of the home in which the [[Annunciation]] of [[Archangel Gabriel]] occurred. The building structure came to be known as the "Holy House", and later became both a [[shrine]] and the focus of pilgrimage to Walsingham. The wooden image was carved in [[Oberammergau]], [[Germany]], and was once associated with the [[Virgin of Mercy]] under the venerated Marian title of [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Our Lady of Ransom]], sometimes locally worded as "Our Lady of the Dowry". The popularity of the Marian cult gradually localized the place of devotion as "Our Lady of Walsingham".

==Holy House and pilgrimages==
The historian J. C. Dickinson argues that the chapel was founded in the time of Edward the Confessor, about 1053, the earliest deeds naming Richeldis, the mother of Geoffrey of Favraches, as the founder. Dickinson claims that in 1169, Geoffrey granted "to God and St Mary and to Edwy his clerk the chapel of our Lady" which his mother had founded at Walsingham with the intention that Edwy should found a priory. These gifts were, shortly afterwards, confirmed to the Austin Canons of Walsingham by Robert de Brucurt and Roger, earl of Clare.&lt;ref name="Norfolk Vol p 394-401"&gt;''A History of the County of Norfolk Vol. 2'', William Page VCH pp. 394-401.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, historian Bill Flint (2015) has refuted the foundation date established by Dickinson, arguing that the 1161 Norfolk Roll refers to the foundation of the priory only and not the shrine. Flint supports the earlier date of 1061 given in the Pynson Ballad and claims that in this year, Queen [[Edith the Fair]], Lady of the Manor, was the likely Walsingham visionary. By the time of its destruction in 1538 during the reign of Henry VIII, the shrine had become one of the greatest religious centres in England and Europe, together with [[Glastonbury]] and [[Canterbury]]. It had been a place of pilgrimage during medieval times, when due to wars and political upheaval, travel to [[Rome]] and [[Santiago de Compostela]] was tedious and difficult.&lt;ref name=RC&gt;{{cite web  | title = Welcome message on the ''Roman Catholic Shrine'' website  | url = http://www.walsingham.org.uk/romancatholic/  | accessdate = 2008-04-24  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080417212441/http://www.walsingham.org.uk/romancatholic/  | archivedate = 17 April 2008  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, royal patronage helped the shrine to grow both in wealth and popularity, receiving regal visits from the following kings and queen: 
* [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]]
* [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]
* [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]]
* [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]
* [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]]
* [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]]
* [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]
* [[Queen Catherine of Aragon]]&lt;ref name=clayton&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15543a.htm Clayton, Joseph. "Walsingham Priory." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 24 Sept. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Visiting in 1513, [[Desiderius Erasmus]] wrote the following:

{{Quote| "When you look in you would say it is the abode of saints, so brilliantly does it shine with gems, gold and silver ... Our Lady stands in the dark at the right side of the altar ... a little image, remarkable neither for its size, material or workmanship."&lt;ref name=southwark/&gt;}}

It was also a place of pilgrimage for [[Queen Catherine of Aragon]] who was a regular pilgrim. Likewise, [[Anne Boleyn]] also publicly announced an intention of making a pilgrimage but it never occurred. Its wealth and prestige did not, however, prevent its being a disorderly house. The visitation of Bishop Nicke in 1514 revealed that the prior was leading a scandalous life and that, among many other things, he treated the canons with insolence and brutality; the canons themselves frequented taverns and were quarrelsome. The prior, William Lowth, was removed and by 1526 some decent order had been restored.

==Destruction==
[[File:Walsinghamseal.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ancient seal of the Medieval priory, with the [[Annunciation]] text surrounding "''Ave Maria Gratia Plena Dominus Tecum''" in which the present image from [[Oberammergau]] was carved]]
The suppression of the monasteries was part of the [[English Reformation]]. On the pretext of discovering any irregularities in their life, [[Thomas Cromwell]] organised a series of visitations, the results of which led to the suppression of smaller foundations (which did not include Walsingham) in 1536. Six years earlier the prior, Richard Vowell, had signed their acceptance of the king's supremacy, but it did not save them. Cromwell's actions were politically motivated but the canons, who had a number of houses in Norfolk, were not noted for their piety or good order.&lt;ref&gt;David Knowles ''Religious Orders in England'' vol 3 p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; The prior was evidently compliant but not all of the community felt likewise. In 1537, two lay choristers organised "the most serious plot hatched anywhere south of the Trent",&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Elton, ''Policy and Police'' (Cambridge 1972) p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; intended to resist what they feared, rightly as it turned out, would happen to their foundation. Eleven men were executed as a result. The sub-prior, Nicholas Milcham, was charged with conspiring to rebel against the suppression of the lesser monasteries, and on flimsy evidence was convicted of high treason and hanged outside the priory walls.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt;

The suppression of the Walsingham priory came late in 1538, under the supervision of Sir Roger Townshend, a local landowner. Walsingham was famous and its fall symbolic.

John Hussey wrote to Lord Lisle in 1538: "July 18th: This day our late Lady of Walsingham was brought to Lambhithe (Lambeth) where was both my Lord Chancellor and my Lord Privy Seal, with many virtuous prelates, but there was offered neither oblation nor candle : what shall become of her is not determined."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/24th-july-1948/8/our-lady-of-walsingham "Our Lady of Walsingham"], ''The Tablet'', 24 July 1948, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Two chroniclers, Hall and Speed, suggest that the actual burning did not take place until September.

The buildings were looted and largely destroyed, but the memory of it was less easy to eradicate. Sir Roger wrote to Cromwell in 1564 that a woman of nearby Wells (now called Wells-Next-The-Sea) had declared that a miracle had been done by the statue after it had been carried away to London. He had the woman put in the stocks on market day to be abused by the village folk but concluded "I cannot perceyve but the seyd image is not yett out of the sum of ther heddes."&lt;ref name="Norfolk Vol p 394-401"/&gt;

The site of the priory with the churchyard and gardens was granted by the Crown to Thomas Sydney. All that remained of it was the gatehouse, the chancel arch and a few outbuildings. The Elizabethan ballad, "A Lament for Walsingham", expresses something of what the Norfolk people felt at the loss of their shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham.&lt;ref name=clayton/&gt;

==Pontifical approbations==
* [[Pope Leo XIII]] issued a Papal decree from [[Rome]] blessing the Marian image for public veneration on 6 February 1897.
* [[Pope Pius XII]] granted a [[canonical coronation]] to the Roman Catholic image via the [[Apostolic Nunciature to Great Britain|Papal Nuncio]], Bishop [[Gerald O'Hara]], on 15 August 1954 with a gold crown funded by her female devotees, now venerated in the [[Slipper Chapel]].
* [[Pope John Paul II]] venerated the image for [[Pentecost]] at the [[Wembley Stadium]] on 29 May 1982 during an open-air [[Holy Mass]].
* [[Pope Francis]] raised her sanctuary to the status of a [[minor basilica]] on 27 December 2015 through an apostolic decree from the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope designates Walsingham shrine as a minor basilica |url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2015/12/31/pope-designates-walsingham-shrine-as-a-minor-basilica/ |publisher=[[Catholic Herald]] |date=31 December 2015 |accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern revival==
After nearly four hundred years the 20th century saw the restoration of pilgrimage to Walsingham as a regular feature of [[Christian]] life in the British Isles and beyond. There are both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] shrines in Walsingham.

===Slipper Chapel===
In 1340, the [[Slipper Chapel]] was built at Houghton St Giles, a mile outside Walsingham. This was the final "station" chapel on the way to Walsingham. It was here that pilgrims would remove their shoes to walk the final "Holy Mile" to the shrine barefoot.&lt;ref name=southwark&gt;[http://www.rcsouthwark.co.uk/walsingham_history.html "Brief History of the Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham", Archdiocese of Southwark]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, Charlotte Pearson Boyd purchased the 14th-century Slipper Chapel, which had seen centuries of secular use, and set about its restoration.&lt;ref name=Nottingham&gt;[http://catholic-community.org.uk/theSite/2012/06/17/our-lady-of-walsingham/ "Our Lady of Walsingham", The Catholic Community of the University of Nottingham]&lt;/ref&gt; The statue of the Mother and Child was carved at [[Oberammergau]] and based on the design of the original statue - a design found on the medieval seal of Walsingham Priory.&lt;ref name=southwark/&gt;

In 1897, [[Pope Leo XIII]] re-established the restored 14th-century Slipper Chapel as a Roman Catholic shrine, now the centre of the [[National Shrine]] of Our Lady of Walsingham.&lt;ref name=shrine&gt;{{cite web  | title = The Roman Catholic National Shrine of our Lady, Walsingham, England  | url = http://www.walsingham.org.uk/romancatholic/  | accessdate = 2012-10-21  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080417212441/http://www.walsingham.org.uk/romancatholic/  | archivedate = 17 April 2008  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy House had been rebuilt at the Church of the Annunciation at [[King's Lynn]] (Walsingham was part of this Roman Catholic parish in 1897).

===Anglican shrine===
{{Main|Anglican Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham}}
The Anglican Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham was created in 1938. In 1921, Fr [[Hope Patten]] was appointed Vicar of Walsingham. He set up a statue of Our Lady of Walsingham, based on the image depicted on the seal of the medieval priory, in the Parish Church of St Mary. As the number of pilgrims to the site increased, a new chapel was dedicated in 1931 and the statue was moved to it. The chapel was extended in 1938 to form the current Anglican shrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story So Far|url=http://www.walsinghamanglican.org.uk/the_shrine/the_story_so_far.htm|website=walsinghamanglican.org.uk|publisher=The Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham|accessdate=16 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727222021/http://www.walsinghamanglican.org.uk/the_shrine/the_story_so_far.htm|archivedate=27 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodox chapel===
There is an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] presence at Walsingham. The Eastern Orthodox Church have the use of a small chapel on a landing in the Holy House as well as the former Victorian [[Walsingham railway station|railway station]] building nearby which has become the Orthodox Church of St Seraphim, complete with a small onion dome on the roof.

==Veneration==
[[File:Scapular of Our Lady of Walsingham.jpg|thumb|The [[Scapular of Our Lady of Walsingham]], sitting on a [[bye-altar]] at the National Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham in the [[Anglican Catholic Church]]]]
There is frequently an ecumenical dimension to pilgrimages to Walsingham, with many pilgrims arriving at the Slipper Chapel and then walking to the Holy House at the Anglican shrine. [[Student Cross]] is the longest continuous walking pilgrimage in Britain to Walsingham which takes place over Holy Week and Easter.

In the United States the National Shrine to Our Lady of Walsingham for the Episcopal Church is located in [[Grace Church, Sheboygan]], [[Wisconsin]], and for the Catholic Church at Saint Bede's Church, [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]. Our Lady of Walsingham is remembered by Roman Catholics on 24 September and by Anglicans on 15 October. The [[Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham|personal ordinariate]] established for former Anglicans in England and Wales is named for of Our Lady of Walsingham. The [[cathedral]] of the [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter]] in Houston, Texas, is named for Our Lady of Walsingham. A [[Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate|Western Rite]] [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America|Antiochian Orthodox]] parish named for Our Lady of Walsingham is in [[Mesquite, Texas]].

In addition, some people are invested into the [[Scapular of Our Lady of Walsingham]] while the [[Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham]] is named in her honor.

{{Status of religious freedom |persecution}}

[[Traditional African religions]] have faced [[Religious persecution|persecution]] from the proponents of different ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.za/books?id=YrIjNMu5_vsC&amp;q=Africans+were+equal+partners#v=snippet&amp;q=Africans%20were%20equal%20partners&amp;f=false Anne C.

(2013), Page 268, https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1133603564:"Later, during the nineteenth century, Christian missionaries became active in Africa and Oceania. Attempts by Christian missionaries to convert nonbelievers to Christianity took two main forms: forced conversions and proselytizing."&lt;/ref&gt; The atrocities include killings, waging war, destroying of sacred places, and other atrocious actions.&lt;ref&gt;

Over the next centuries, the rest of the Maghreb would succumb to Jihadist armies...The notion of religion conversion, whether by force or peaceful means, is foreign to indigenous African beliefs...Islam, however, did not become a religion of the masses by peaceful means. Forced conversion was an indispensable element of proselytization."&lt;/ref&gt;

==By Muslims==
{{See also|Persecution by Muslims|Religious persecution#Persecution of Serers}}

After the establishment of Islam, its rapid expansion and [[Muslim conquests|conquests]] displaced traditional African religions either by conversion or [[Muslim conquest of North Africa|conquest]]. Traditional African religions have influenced Islam in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Black God: The Afroasiatic Roots of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Religions, Julian Baldick&lt;/ref&gt; and Islam is considered as having more commonality with traditional African religions,&lt;ref&gt;"African traditional religion in the modern world", p. 125, by Douglas E. Thomas&lt;/ref&gt; but conflict has occurred, especially due to Islam's [[Tawhid|monotheistic stance]] and the rise of Muslim reformers such as [[Askia]].

In the Senegambia region, the [[Serer people]] who held [[Serer religion|"a strong connection to their ancient religious past"]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Molefi Kete Asante|Asante, Molefi Kete]], Mazama, Ama, ''Encyclopedia of African Religion'', SAGE Publications (2008), p. 846, {{ISBN|9781506317861}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uMv0CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT846#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cheikh Anta Diop|Diop, Cheikh Anta]], ''The origin of civilization : Myth or reality'', (edited and translated by Mercer Cook)  Laurence Hill Books (1974), p. 191-9, {{ISBN|978-1-55652-072-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the  [[Religious persecution#Persecution of Serers|targets of Islamic jihads and persecution from the 11th to the 19th-century]] resulting in the [[Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune]].

Traditional African religions are tolerant of other gods, which allows general co-existence for multiple religions. This has been regarded by some authors to be another reason behind the rise of other religions in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Molefi Kete Asante, "Encyclopedia of African Religion", Volume 1, 287:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is this awareness of the limitation of human knowledge of God that explains, in part, the amazingly tolerant nature of African traditional religion and the absence of excommunications and persecution of heretics in the religious history of Africa ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Most followers of traditional religions accommodated Islam during the start of its spread in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;"The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to African Religions", 325, by Elias Kifon Bongmba&lt;/ref&gt; but in West Africa, it was not until the coming of colonialism that Islam gained mass appeal, transforming even groups with historical animosity towards Islamic domination into Muslim communities.

In many instances, conflicting groups chose to align with Muslim armies against other African communities.&lt;ref&gt;Warfare in African History (New Approaches to African History)  Richard J. Reid, Kindle Edition, location 617&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Relationship===
The relationship of Islam and traditional African religions was far from hostile but more defined by accommodation and co-existence.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The tradition of ''[[jihad]]'' remained a minor theme.&lt;ref&gt;''Muslim Societies in African History (New Approaches to African History)'', David Robinson, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Songhai Empire]], the ruler [[Sonni Baru]] held or [[Syncretism|syncretised]] aspects of the African traditional religions and was challenged by Askia because he was not seen as a faithful Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.za/books?id=GX1fNzyNO5AC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22Sunni+Baru%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aBLHUoyYF5GM7AbS14G4Cw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sunni%20Baru%22&amp;f=false Towards an Understanding of the African Experience from Historical] By Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam&lt;/ref&gt; Askia would later wage wars against those who were politically non-aligned Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;"The West African Empire of Songhai in 10 Easy Lessons: Introduction to Black History", p. 17, by Robin Walker, Siaf Millar&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Dunama Dabbalemi]] of the [[Sayfawa dynasty]] converted to Islam, he waged ''[[Jihad]]'', or holy war, against the proponents of the [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] religion, seeking to destroy its presence.&lt;ref&gt;"Three Continents, One History: Birmingham, the Transatlantic Slave Trade and the Caribbean", p. 18, by Clive Harris&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Swahili coast, Muslims were not interested in preaching, colonization, or jihad. It was not until the 18th century that Islam spread into the interior. [[Molefi Asante]] notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The religion of Islam made each Muslim merchant or traveler an embryonic missionary and the appeal of the religion with its similarities to the African religions was far more powerful than the Christian appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Asante, Genocide in Africa 1991 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asante.net/articles/37/afrocentricity/|title=Genocide in Sudan (1991)|date= May 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By Christians==
{{expand section|date=January 2014}}
{{See also|Colonialism|History of colonialism|History of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance}}

The early Christians of [[Niger Delta]] who were against the customs and traditions of the indigenous tribes carried out atrocities such as destroying their shrines and killing the sacred [[iguana]].&lt;ref&gt;"Visions &amp; Revisions: Selected Discourses on Literary Criticism", p. 176, by Emeka Nwabueze&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scramble for Africa|European colonization of Africa]] is noted to have paved the way of [[Christian missionaries]] into Africa. In some cases, the leaders of traditional African religions were persecuted by the missionaries and regarded as the "devil's agents". [[Ali Mazrui]] has discussed similar issues in the book ''The African Condition''.&lt;ref&gt;"Education for Renaissance in Africa- Large Format" by Raphael J.Njoroge, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; A further example of persecution by missionaries is how many of the earliest [[Christian missionaries]] to the [[Shona people]], of modern day [[Zimbabwe]], desecrated shrines located in Matonjeni, harassed [[Shona people|Shona]] priests and decried [[Mwari]], the Shona God, as being a fake and inept God. This persecution continued until the [[Shona people|Shona]] were completely prevented from worshipping their God, [[Mwari]], at Matonjeni.&lt;ref&gt;"African Traditional Religion Encounters Christianity: The Resilience of a Demonized Religion" by John Chitakure, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite attempts at tolerance and [[Interfaith dialogue|Interreligious Dialogue]], in many Christian churches there was a belief that "everything African seems to be pagan", and some argue this view remains today in certain evangelical Pentecostal religious positions. The historical view that Africans had to become "civilized" by slavery, colonialism and Christian missionary activity likely contributed to the intolerance of traditional religions during the colonial period. These views culminated in some colonials rejecting that traditional African faiths were proper religions.&lt;ref&gt;"African Religion in the Dialogue Debate: From Intolerance to Coexistence" By Laurenti Magesa, p. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern times==
On 2001, an [[Oro Festival]] in [[Sagamu]] was violated by the Muslim [[Hausa-Fulani]] inhabitants, causing a temporary breakdown between the groups.&lt;ref name="WestAfrican"&gt;"West African Militancy and Violence", by James Gow, Funmi Olonisakin, Ernst Dijxhoorn, p. 31-32, url = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jdkcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT67]&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of the [[Bwiti]] religion have faced persecution by Christian missionaries and French colonial authorities, as well as some members of the present [[Gabon]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=La religion bouiti, Volumes 1 à 2 |first=Stanislaw |last=Swiderski |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCJ71rRnzhgC&amp;pg=PA161 |quote=The persecutions of the Bwiti, organized by the Catholic Church and the colonial government, or even by certain members of the present government, have reinforced the "racial" and religious consciousness of the Bwiti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Razhden''' ({{lang-ka|რაჟდენი|tr}}, also transliterated as '''Ražden''' or '''Rajden'''; died {{circa|457}}) was a 5th-century [[Persian people|Persian]] nobleman in the service of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] king [[Vakhtang I of Iberia]] and a convert to [[Christianity]] who was executed by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] military in [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]]. He was canonized by the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] as '''St. Razhden the Protomartyr''' (რაჟდენ პირველმოწამე, ''razhden pirvelmotsame''), with his [[feast day]] marked on [[August 16 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|August 16]] ([[Old Style|O.S.]] August 3).&lt;ref name="Machitadze"&gt;Machitadze, Archpriest Zakaria (2006), [http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/7304.htm "St. Razhden, Protomartyr of the Georgian Church (†457)"], in [http://www.pravoslavie.ru/enarticles/070306192614 ''The Lives of the Georgian Saints''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614125437/http://www.pravoslavie.ru/enarticles/070306192614 |date=2008-06-14 }}. ''pravoslavie.ru''. Retrieved on 2011-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest mention of Razhden is found in the ''History of King Vakhtang Gorgasali'', part of the medieval [[The Georgian Chronicles|Georgian historical compendium]], composed in the 8th or 11th century and traditionally attributed to [[Juansheriani|Juansher Juansheriani]].&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), ''Studies in Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts'', p. 226. Peeters Publishers, {{ISBN|90-429-1318-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The source relates Razhden's death as a martyr during the war of Sassanids against Vakhtang I.&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;[[Robert W. Thomson|Thomson, Robert W.]] (1996), ''Rewriting Caucasian History'', pp. 217, 220. [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-826373-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Razhden was a guardian or tutor (მამამძუძუ, ''mamamdzudzu'') of [[Balendukht]], a daughter of the king of the Persians, whom he accompanied to Iberia on the occasion of her marriage with Vakhtang. Razhden converted to Christianity and entered Vakhtang’s service, proving himself an able soldier. He was eventually taken captive by the Persians and tortured to death for refusing to reject Christianity. Vakhtang later built the church of [[Nikozi]] at the site of Razhden's burial and installed a bishop there. According to the "History of King Vakhtang Gorgasali", Vakhtang also built a church in St. Razhden's honor in the suburb of [[Ujarma]].&lt;ref name="Thomson"/&gt;

==Hagiography==
[[File:Nikozi Cathedral (Photo. A. Muhranoff, 2011).jpg|thumb|left|The church of Nikozi]]
In the 1720s, the brief medieval narrative of Juansher was transformed into [[hagiography]] by the [[Catholicos of Georgia|Georgian catholicos]] [[Besarion Orbelishvili]], who refurbished the story with further details. According to Besarion, the captive Razhden was pressured by the king of the Persians himself into denouncing his Christian faith. Briefly freed, through the mediation of Georgian nobles, to bid a farewell to his family, Razhden voluntarily returned to captivity and was handed over to a Persian commander in [[Tsromi]], in [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]], where he was eventually [[crucifixion|crucified]], along with five criminals, and shot with arrows. Besarion also authored a [[canon (hymnography)|canon]] to St. Razhden, while another Georgian catholicos of the 18th century, [[Anton I of Georgia|Anton I]], included a rewritten passion of Razhden in his collection of Georgian martyrdoms in the 1760s.&lt;ref name="qim"&gt;{{ka icon}} Khoperia, Lela (2010).

Accessed December 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources on Razhden were compiled by [[Mikhail Sabinin]] into his account of the saint's life, embedded in the "Paradise of Georgia" (საქართველოს სამოთხე, ''sakartvelos samotkhe'') published in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1882.&lt;ref name="qim"/&gt; Razhden's passion was translated into [[Latin language|Latin]] and published, in 1914, by [[Paul Peeters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} Peeters, Paul (1914), "Mensis augusti die III. Passio et certamen sancti megalomartyris Razden, qui tempore magni regis Vakhtang a Persis passus est in Hiberiae pago Dsromi". ''Analecta bollandiana'' '''33''': 305-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18242">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Religion in ''Futurama''}}
The [[animation|animated]] [[science fiction]] television program ''[[Futurama]]'' makes a number of satirical and humorous references to [[religion]], including inventing several fictional religions which are explored in certain episodes of the series.

== Fictional religions ==

=== Robotology ===
The episode "[[Hell Is Other Robots]]" centers around [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]]'s becoming addicted to high-voltage electricity, then discovering the religion of '''Robotology''' to help him break the habit. Sermons are conducted at the Temple of Robotology by the [[Reverend Lionel Preacherbot|Reverend Preacherbot]], a character whose mannerisms draw heavily on [[black church]] preacher stereotypes.&lt;ref name="gospel02" /&gt;  ''Robotology'' is a play on the name [[Scientology]],&lt;ref name="gospel01"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinsky |first=Mark |title=The Gospel According to the Simpsons |year=2001 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |isbn=0-664-22419-9 |pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and series creator [[Matt Groening]] has said that he received a call from the Church of Scientology concerned about the use of a similar name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people=Groening, Matt|year=2003|title=[[Futurama]] season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Hell Is Other Robots]]"| medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=I did get a call from a Scientologist who had somehow gotten hold of the script.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Resistor symbol America.svg|thumb|right|200px|The symbol of Robotology is based on the [[electronic symbol]] for a [[resistor]] used in electrical [[circuit diagram]]s.&lt;ref name="cohen01"&gt;{{cite video| people=Cohen, David X. |year=2003|title=[[Futurama]] season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Hell Is Other Robots]]"| medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=Their symbol is a resistor, also, for anyone who knows electronics.}} which is shown here.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Robotology has a [[holy text]], ''The Good Book 3.0'' which is stored on a 3.5" [[floppy disk]]. Two symbols of the religion are shown in the episode.  The first is a zig-zag line with a circle at either end, based on the [[electronic symbol]] used for [[resistor]]s on [[circuit diagram]]s.&lt;ref name="cohen01" /&gt; &lt;!-- So… what’s the other symbol? --&gt;

Robots who accept Robotology are expected to abstain from behavior such as [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[pornography]], [[theft|stealing]], abusing electricity, and drinking [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. Consuming alcohol is usually necessary to power a robot's fuel cells, but this episode establishes that [[mineral oil]] is an acceptable substitute.  Sinners are punished by condemnation to '''Robot Hell''', located under an abandoned amusement park in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].  The punishments in Robot Hell are similar to the levels and rationale portrayed in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', specifically the [[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]].&lt;ref name="gospel02" /&gt;

Robot Hell is controlled by the [[Robot Devil]]. He is bound by the Fairness in Hell Act of 2275, allowing anyone who can defeat him in a [[fiddle]] contest with a solid gold fiddle to win their freedom, as well the golden fiddle itself, a reference to the song "[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]".&lt;ref name="gospel02" /&gt; Should the individual lose the fiddle contest, they will only receive a smaller, silver fiddle and the Robot Devil may kill them at his discretion.

In "[[Ghost in the Machines]]", Bender's ghost is sent to an equivalent robot Heaven monitored by a Robot God whose streamlined design is reminiscent of EVE in the [[Pixar]] animated film ''[[WALL-E]]''. This God appears to be distinct from the more ambiguous, universal 'God' character that appeared in "[[Godfellas]]" and "[[Bender's Big Score]]", who may or may not have been representative of the Gods of all religions, and/or a machine. Notably, the Robot God does not deny being God and treats Bender's ghost as his subject.

=== Robot Judaism ===
The episode "[[Future Stock]]" introduces Robot Judaism in a scene where [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] and [[Dr. Zoidberg]], seeking free food, sneak into a "Bot Mitzvah" celebration (a spoof of the [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]).  As a joke about [[Kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]]' proscriptions against shellfish, Zoidberg was not allowed in (despite having Jewish stereotype qualities) inasmuch as he was an anthropomorphic lobster.  At the Bot Mitzvah, Fry asks a Jewish robot if they don't believe in Robot Jesus, to which the robot replies, "We believe he was built, and that he was a very well-programmed robot, but he wasn't our Messiah".  A banner written in [[Hebrew]] reads "Today you are a robot" (with two misspellings),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/futuramavol3.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823143014/http://dvdverdict.com/reviews/futuramavol3.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 August 2004 |title=Futurama: Volume Three |author=Ryan, David |accessdate=28 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; referencing the traditional Jewish belief that a boy becomes a man on his Bar Mitzvah. In the episode "[[The Bots and the Bees]]" Bender's son, Ben, has a Bot Mitzvah celebration of his own where he becomes a man after being born only a few days prior. This scene reinforces the quick rate at which robots mature in the Futurama world as well as alludes to the practice of robot circumcision.

References to a holiday called 'Robanukah' appear in several episodes, as well, though it is heavily implied that Bender makes up this holiday to avoid work. In the Futurama Holiday Spectacular, the Robanukah story involves a pair of fembots who must wrestle in petroleum oil for six and a half weeks. When the oil, which was predicted to last only four and a half weeks, lasts for 500 million years, Bender declares it a Robanukah miracle.

=== The First Amalgamated Church ===
[[Image:Futurama - First Amalgamated Church.jpg|thumb|right|The logo of the First Amalgamated Church, featuring the symbols of the contemporary religions [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], and [[Buddhism]].]]
The First Amalgamated Church is a [[syncretism|syncretic]] denomination of several mainstream religions extant in the 21st-century, and is referenced in several episodes. The church and one of its priests, [[Father Changstein el-Gamal]], are introduced in the episode "[[Godfellas]]". Father Changstein el-Gamal reappears in "[[The Sting (Futurama)|The Sting]]" at Fry's funeral service, and in ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'' at Lars' and Leela's wedding.  The religion appears to be a mix of [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] and even [[agnosticism]].

===Other religions===
Other religions are depicted or mentioned in passing in other episodes. In the episode "[[Hell Is Other Robots]]", [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] complains about Bender's devotion to Robotology, saying, "If only he had joined a mainstream religion, like [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprahism]] or [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]]".

In the season 2 episode "[[I Second That Emotion (Futurama)|I Second That Emotion]]", Fry, Leela, and Bender are shown around the sewer mutants' village. Fry notices a large gold-plated [[ICBM]] on the altar of the cathedral and exclaims "Wow! You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?" to which one of the mutants responds "Yeah, but nobody is that observant. It's mostly a Christmas and Easter thing." The altar and the bomb are a reference to the film ''[[Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]'',  in which the religion worship of the subterranean is focused on a nuclear bomb.

The season 4 episode "[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]", presents the situation of a television show becoming elevated to the status of a religion in the form of the "Church of Trek", where devotees of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' worship the characters and attend services dressed as officers and aliens from the show (in 23rd or 24th century).

In the second ''Futurama'' straight-to-DVD film, ''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]'', Fry becomes the pope of a new religion which worships the interdimensional planet-sized tentacle monster named Yivo, who brainwashed the inhabitants of Earth by attaching his tentacles to their brains, before taking them onto him, which resembled [[heaven]].

In the third film ''[[Bender's Game]]'', Professor Farnsworth invokes the name of "the all-powerful Atheismo".

In the season 7 episode "[[Free Will Hunting]]", when Bender walks throughout Chapek 9 looking to discover his never-programmed free-will unit, he happens upon a religious monastery led by a monk named Ab-bot; the abbot takes him in and converts him into his religion called "Order of the Binary Singularity" believing in the promise "Creatrix" or Mom will give them free-will units.

== References to existing religions ==
Aside from inventing religions, the writers of ''Futurama'' also make references to established faiths.

In the episode "[[When Aliens Attack]]", Earth is invaded by Omicronians demanding to see the season finale of ''Single Female Lawyer'', a television show which was accidentally knocked off the air 1,000 years earlier by [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]]. [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] explains that the show no longer exists because most video tapes from that era were destroyed during the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]] in the year 2443.&lt;ref name="Drawn To TV"&gt;{{cite book|last=Booker| first=M. Keith|title=Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy|pages=115–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Keeler]], the writer of the episode, considered this joke one of the most [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] lines in the show, because it suggested that the Second Coming had been and gone and life for the unsaved on Earth had carried on much as before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people=Keeler, Ken |year=2003|title=[[Futurama]] season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "[[When Aliens Attack]]"| medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox |quote=...what I like to think is the most sacrilegious joke ever put in the series about the Second Coming of Jesus already having happened and apparently life going on as usual afterwards.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jesus]] is referenced several times throughout the show, the most notable being on "[[A Tale of Two Santas]]", where all of the crew dress up as Santa and Zoidberg dresses up as "his friend Jesus" to attempt to stay Bender's execution. When the real Robot Santa appears and attacks the crew and the people attempting to execute Bender, the executioner exclaims "Get him, Jesus!" before diving behind an object, and in reference to Benjamin Franklin's famous remark, Zoidberg replies, "I help those who help themselves."

On several occasions, Professor Farnsworth uses the phrase "Sweet Zombie Jesus!" as an expression of shock or dismay. These exclamations are usually cut for [[television syndication|syndication]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pulliam |first=June |title=Sweet Zombie Jesus! This Theological Study of The Undead Won’t Have You Using Any Names in Vain |url=http://www.lsu.edu/necrofile/gospel24.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524000645/http://www.lsu.edu/necrofile/gospel24.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 May 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the DVD of Futurama episode "[[The Deep South (Futurama)|The Deep South]]," a cut scene shows Farnsworth muttering in his sleep about the Zombie Jesus returning at tea-time, when Farnsworth has no food to supply it.

Another undead figure, Chanukah Zombie, first mentioned in the episode "[[A Tale of Two Santas]]", makes an appearance in ''[[Bender's Big Score]]''. He teams up with [[Robot Santa]] and [[Kwanzaa Bot]] to fight alien scam artists who have seized possession of planet Earth. His weapons are themed around Jewish symbols and artifacts, including explosive [[dreidel]]s and a [[TIE fighter]] (a reference to ''[[Star Wars]]''; Star Wars actor [[Mark Hamill]] supplies Chanukah Zombie's voice) adorned with [[Star of David|Stars of David]] and a [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]].

[[Catholicism]] is shown to still exist in some form in the 31st century, as the show makes several references to the "Space Pope": in the opening titles of "[[Hell is Other Robots]]" (stating that the show has been "Condemned by the Space Pope"); in "[[A Bicyclops Built for Two]]", with Bender's [[rhetorical question]] "Is the Space Pope [[reptile|reptilian]]?"; and in "[[I Dated a Robot]]", in an endorsement at the end of an educational film ("Brought to you by the Space Pope").  In the last of these, a graphic displays a picture of the Space Pope as a reptilian alien in Papal [[vestment]]s, encircled by the words ''Crocodylus pontifex''. Additionally, in the episode "[[Put Your Head on My Shoulders]]", Fry and [[Amy Wong]] have a lighthearted conversation about their parents' expectations of them; Fry remarks, "What am I, the [[Pope]]?" to which Amy replies, "Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, 'Straighten your Pope hat,' and 'Put on your good vestments!'" In the [[Futurama (season 6)|sixth season]] episode, [[The Duh-Vinci Code]], the cast travels to [[Rome]] (announced as Future-Roma), where the Space Pope directs the ship's landing at the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. A few episodes later, in "[[The Silence of the Clamps]]," the Space Pope is shown conducting the wedding of the Donbot's older daughter.

Conversely, [[Satanism]] is also shown to still exist in some form in the 31st century.  In the episode "[[A Taste of Freedom]]," Zoidberg's lawyer, Old Man Waterfall, requests a Satanic funeral [[rite]] before dying, and Professor Farnsworth, in "[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]", when he is presumably creating the box containing the parallel universe, appeals to Satan for help, mentioning that Satan owes him.

It is implied that some form of [[Neopaganism]] may still exist in the future, based on references to a [[lesbian]] [[coven]] across the street from Planet Express in "[[Future Stock]]".

In "[[The Lesser of Two Evils]]," one of the Miss Universe pageant contestants is an energy being identified, with little fanfare, as "Miss [[Heaven]]," suggesting that by the 31st century, Heaven is an accessible part of the universe rather than a divine afterlife attainable only after death. However, another possibility is that Miss Heaven is simply from a conventional planet that has been ''named'' "Heaven."

Also, [[Hermes Conrad]], who is [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]], claims to be a [[rastafari]]an.

== Godfellas ==
The episode "[[Godfellas]]" explores several religious themes in a more earnest and thought-provoking way than any other episode, and without explicitly referencing or parodying any particular religion. Bender is accidentally cast adrift in space and unwittingly becomes a god figure to a race of tiny people (Shrimpkins) living on an asteroid that impacts his body. Bender attempts to answer their prayers, but ends up harming the Shrimpkins. Meanwhile, the Shrimpkins who have migrated to Bender's backside, out of his sight, grow frustrated that their prayers go entirely unanswered. Eventually the two factions of Shrimpkins wipe one another out in a miniature [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].

After Bender's unsuccessful attempt at [[godhood]], he encounters a god-like entity in space. Bender first wonders if the entity is God, because of its awesome power or a computer because it thinks in binary. The entity responds "Possible, I do feel compassion towards all living things" and "Possible, I am user-friendly" respectively, adding "My good chum" to the end both times. Bender eventually theorizes that the entity may have, in fact, been the remains of a satellite that collided with God, to which the entity replies "Probable". The conversation between them touches on the ideas of [[predestination]], prayer, and the nature of salvation, in what Mark Pinsky referred to as a theological turn to the episode which may cause the viewer to need "to be reminded that this is a cartoon and not a divinity school class".&lt;ref name="gospel02"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinsky |first=Mark |title=The Gospel According to the Simpsons. Bigger and possibly even Better! edition |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-664-23265-8 |pages=229–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the conversation, Bender's questions still have not been fully answered, and he is left wanting more from the voice than it has given him.&lt;ref name="gospel02"/&gt; The character/entity returned, albeit briefly, in the first of the direct-to-DVD installments, ''[[Bender's Big Score]]''.

The episode also sees Fry turning to religion to help locate Bender. Seeking guidance, he visits the First Amalgamated Church. When this fails to help him, Fry visits the "Monks of Dschubba" to use the radio telescope of a sect of monks who are attempting to find God in the universe. This subplot takes religion much more lightly, referring to the monks as a "crazy sect" and suggesting that prayer is usually unreliable.

The episode also makes reference to ''[[The Nine Billion Names of God]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]].&lt;ref name="cook01"&gt;Cook, Lucius (26 April 2004).  [http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Reviews/04Cook_Futurama.html Hey Sexy Mama, Wanna Kill All Humans?: Looking Backwards at Futurama, The Greatest SF Show You've Never Seen]. ''[[Locus Online]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Toons That Teach'', a text used by youth groups to teach teenagers about spirituality, recommends the episode "Godfellas" in a lesson teaching about "Faith, God's Will, [and] Image of God".&lt;ref name="toons01"&gt;{{cite book |last=Case |first=Steve |title=Toons That Teach: 75 Cartoon Moments To Get Teenagers Talking |year=2005 |isbn=0-310-25992-4 |pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and history==
In 1748, [[Baba Deep Singh]] was appointed the leader of the Shaheedan Misl and the [[Mahant]] of the [[Takht Sri Damdama Sahib]]. In 1757, [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] invaded [[India]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of India |last= Hoernle |first=August Friedrich Rudolf |authorlink=Rudolf Hoernlé |author2=Herbert Alick Stark  |year=1906 |publisher=Orissa Mission Press |location= |isbn= |page=113 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-dGAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=Ahmad+Shah+Abdali+fourth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZSrJS_6MHIjWNt3BzI0J&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDwQ6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ahmad%20Shah%20Abdali%20fourth&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sent an army to the [[Harmindar Sahib]] to block [[Sikhs]] from entering the [[Gurdwara]].

His successor, Suddha Singh, later led the misl into a skirmish against the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] government of Jalandhar City The first two leaders of the misl were considered [[Shahid|Shaheeds]], or  [[martyr]]s, by their contemporaries so the misl became known as, Shaheedan, or the followers of the martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Calcutta review, Volume 77 |authorlink= |publisher=University of Calcutta, University of Calcutta.

The [[Nihang]] order of [[Sikhs]] maintains the traditions of this [[misl]].&lt;ref name="McLeod 2005 186"/&gt;

Present day roots can be traced to the descendants of Sirdar Bahadur General Gulab Singh of the Shaheedan Misl and Sikh Army.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13084">[[Image:Luca Giordano 017.jpg|thumb|right|''Temperantia'', by [[Luca Giordano]]]]

'''Temperance''' is  defined as [[moderation]] or voluntary self-restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Green | first=Joel | title=Dictionary of scripture and ethics | publisher=Baker Academic | location=Grand Rapids, Mich | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-8010-3406-0 | page=769}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically described in terms of what an individual voluntarily refrains from doing.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer 2012"/&gt; This includes restraint from retaliation in the form of non-violence and forgiveness, restraint from arrogance in the form of humility and modesty, restraint from excesses such as splurging now in the form of prudence, and restraint from excessive anger or craving for something in the form of calmness and self-control.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer 2012"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schwarzer | first=Ralf | title=Personality, human development, and culture : international perspectives on psychological science | publisher=Psychology | location=Hove | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-415-65080-9 | pages=127–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperance has been described as a [[virtue]] by religious thinkers, philosophers, and more recently, psychologists, particularly in the [[positive psychology]] movement. In classical iconography, the virtue is often depicted as a woman holding two vessels transferring water from one to another.  It was one of the [[cardinal virtue]]s in western thought found in [[Greek philosophy]] and Christianity, as well as eastern traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. 

Temperance is one of the six virtues in the [[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|positive psychology]] classification, included with [[wisdom]], [[courage]], [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]], [[justice]], and [[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|transcendence]].&lt;ref name="gcc"&gt;{{cite book | last=Peterson | first=Christopher | title=Character strengths and virtues a handbook and classification | publisher=American Psychological Association Oxford University Press | location=Washington, DC New York | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-19-516701-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally characterized as the control over excess, and expressed through characteristics such as [[chastity]], [[modesty]], [[humility]], [[self control|self-regulation]], [[forgiveness]] and [[mercy]]; each of these involves restraining an excess of some [[impulse (psychology)|impulse]], such as [[sexual desire]], [[vanity]], or [[anger]].

The term "temperance" can also refer to the abstention from alcohol ([[teetotalism]]), especially with reference to the [[temperance movement]].

== History ==
===Greek civilization===

The Greek definition of temperance translates to "moderation in action, thought, or feeling; restraint". Temperance is a major Athenian virtue, as advocated by [[Plato]]; self-restraint (sôphrosune) is one of his four core virtues of the ideal city, and echoed by [[Aristotle]]. According to Aristotle, "temperance is a mean with regard to pleasures".&lt;ref name="rmn2013"/&gt; In "[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]", one of Plato's early dialogues, the one who possessed 'sophrosune' is defined in four ways: (1) one who has quietness, (2) one who has modesty, (3) one who does his own business, and (4) one who knows himself. Plato quickly dismisses the three first definitions and argues against (4) that if 'sophrosune' would have been only the property of knowing what one knows or not, then it would be useless without knowledge about other matters.

==Religions==
[[File:Eglise de Commana2012 469.JPG|thumb|Representation of temperance (painted wood sculpture, dated 1683, which covers the shrine of the baptismal church Breton [[Commana]] in France). Temperance foot tips over a jug of wine, and presents a pitcher of water]]

Themes of temperance can be seen across cultures and time, as illustrated here.

===Buddhism===
Temperance is an essential part of the [[Eightfold Path]]. The third and fifth of the [[five precepts]] (pañca-sila) reflect values of temperance: "misconduct concerning sense pleasures" and drunkenness are to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, P. (1990). ''An introduction to Buddhism: Teaching, history and practices.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
In the Judeo-Christian tradition, temperance is prolific. The [[Old Testament]] emphasizes temperance as a core virtue, as evidenced in both Solomon's [[Book of Proverbs]] and in the [[Ten Commandments]], with its admonitions against adultery and covetousness. The [[New Testament]] does so as well, with [[forgiveness]] being central to [[theology]] and self-control being one of the [[Fruits of the Spirit]].&lt;ref name=rmn2013/&gt; With regard to Christian theology, the word temperance is used by the [[King James Version]] in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:23 for the Greek word ἐγκρατεία (enkrateia), which means self-control or discipline (''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', 1466). [[Thomas Aquinas]] promoted Plato's original virtues in addition to several others.

Within the Christian church Temperance is a virtue akin to self-control. It is applied to all areas of life. It can especially be viewed in practice among sects like the [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonites]], and [[Conservative Mennonites]]. In the Christian religion, temperance is a virtue that moderates attraction and desire for pleasure and "provides balance in the use of created goods". St. Thomas calls it a "disposition of the mind which binds the passions".&lt;ref name=rmn2013&gt;Niemiec, R. M. (2013). VIA character strengths: Research and practice (The first 10 years). In H. H. Knoop &amp; A. Delle Fave (Eds.), Well-being and cultures: Perspectives on positive psychology (pp. 11-30). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Temperance is believed to combat the sin of [[gluttony]].{{cn|date=November 2016}} Temperance is commonly broken down into four main strengths: forgiveness, humility, prudence, and self-regulation.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

===Hinduism===
The concept of ''dama'' ({{lang-sa|दम|link=no}}) in Hinduism is equivalent to temperance. It is sometimes written as ''damah'' (Sanskrit: दमः).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=self-control Sanskrit translations for Self-Control] English-Sanskrit Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskritdocuments.org/dict/dictall_unic.html Sanskrit Words]; See dama and damah&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''dama'', and Sanskrit derivative words based on it, connote the concepts of self-control and self-restraint. [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], in verse 5.2.3, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (damah), compassion and love for all sentient life ([[compassion|daya]]), and charity ([[Dāna|daana]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n843/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad], Translator: S Madhavananda, page 816, For discussion: pages 814-821; Quote - "तदेतत्त्रयँ शिक्षेद् दमं दानं दयामिति", translation: Learn three cardinal virtues - temperance, charity and [[compassion]] for all life."&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism literature dedicated to [[yoga]], self-restraint is expounded with the concept of ''[[yamas]]'' ({{lang-sa|यम|link=no}}).&lt;ref name=jlh&gt;James Lochtefeld, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, see article on Yama, page 777&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''ṣaṭsampad'', self-restraint (''dama'') is one of the six cardinal virtues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/31.html#dama Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, France], this reference is in french; see explanation under the term dama: contrôle de ses passions&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of virtues that constitute a moral life evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' (moral) life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' (forgiveness), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (free from anger). In later verses this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' (Non-violence), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B. (2006). BHAGAVAD GĪTĀ AS DUTY AND VIRTUE ETHICS. Journal of Religious Ethics, 34(3), 373-395.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohapatra &amp; Mohapatra, Hinduism: Analytical Study, {{ISBN|978-8170993889}}; see pages 37-40&lt;/ref&gt; This trend of evolving concepts continue in classical Sanskrit literature, ''Dama'' with ''[[Ahimsa]]'' and few other virtues present in the evolving list of virtues necessary for a moral life (''dharma'').&lt;ref&gt;Comparative Religion, Kedar Nath Tiwari, {{ISBN|81-208-0294-2}}; see page 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, G. (1983). Puranic notes: reflections on the myth of sukesin. South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies, 6(2), 46-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five types of self-restraints are considered essential for a moral and ethical life in Hindu philosophy: one must refrain from any violence that causes injury to others, refrain from starting or propagating deceit and falsehood, refrain from theft of other's property, refrain from sexually cheating on one's partner, and refrain from avarice.&lt;ref name=jlh/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhws&gt;Heim, M. (2005), Differentiations in Hindu ethics, in William Schweiker (Editor), The Blackwell companion to religious ethics, {{ISBN|0-631-21634-0}}, Chapter 35, pp 341-354&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of self-restraint includes one's action, the words one speaks or writes, and in one's thoughts. The necessity for temperance is explained as preventing bad ''karma'' which sooner or later haunts and returns to the unrestrained.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, G. H. (1926), The Basis of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, 37(1), pp 19-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hindrey, Roderick (1978), Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, Motilal Banarsidass Publications, {{ISBN|81-208-0866-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theological need for self-restraint is also explained as reigning in the damaging effect of one's action on others, as hurting another is hurting oneself because all life is one.&lt;ref name=mhws/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sturgess, Stephen (2013), The Yoga Book: A Practical Guide to Self-realization, Watkins Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-84293-034-2}}, see Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jainism ===
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}
Temperance in [[Jainism]] is deeply imbibed in its five major vows which are:
*[[Ahimsa]] ([[nonviolence]])
*[[Satya]] ([[truth]])
*[[Brahmacharya]] ([[chastity]] or [[celibacy]]), 
*[[Asteya]] (non-stealing)
*[[Aparigraha]] (non-possessiveness). 

In Jainism, the vow of Ahimsa is not just restricted to not resorting to physical violence, but it also encompasses in itself abstinence from violence in any and all form either by thought, speech or action.

On [[Samvatsari]], the last day of [[Paryushan]]—the most prominent festival of Jainism—the Jains greet their friends and relatives on this last day with ''[[Micchami Dukkadam|Micchāmi Dukkaḍaṃ]]'', seeking their forgiveness.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The phrase is also used by [[Jainism|Jains]] throughout the year when a person makes a mistake, or recollects making one in everyday life, or when asking for forgiveness in advance for inadvertent ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Śramana Bhagavān Mahāvira: pt. 1. Sthavirāvali|author= M.R.P. Vijaya|author2=K.C. Jani |publisher=Śri Jaina Siddhanta Society |year=1951|isbn= |page=120 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary organizations==
{{Globalize|date=March 2018}}
Values of temperance are still advocated by more modern sources such as the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], [[William Bennett]], and [[Ben Franklin]].&lt;ref name="Peterson 2004"&gt;Peterson &amp; Seligman 2004, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification''. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy has contributed a number of lessons to the study of traits, particularly in its study of injunctions and its listing and organizing of virtues.

'''Thaipusam''' or '''Thaipoosam''' ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=தைப்பூசம்|trans=Taippūcam}}) is a festival celebrated by the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] community on the full moon in the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil month]] of ''Thai'' (January/February).  It is mainly observed in countries where there is a significant presence of Tamil community such as [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmalaysia.info/msiaknow/festivals/thaipusam/ |title=Malaysia : AllMalaysia.info has all you want to know about Malaysia |publisher=Allmalaysia.info |date= |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mauritius]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism-mauritius.mu/discover/festivals.html|title=Festivals, Cultural Events and Public Holidays in Mauritius|publisher=Mauritius Tourism Authority|date=|accessdate=28 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120005942/http://www.tourism-mauritius.mu/discover/festivals.html|archivedate=20 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitsingapore.com/festivals-events-singapore/cultural-festivals/thaipusam/ Thaipusam in Singapore].&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Africa]], [[Canada]] and other places where ethnic [[Hindu]] [[Tamil people|Tamils]] reside as a part of the local [[Non-Resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indian diaspora]] population such as [[Réunion]], [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Jamaica]] and the other parts of the [[Caribbean]].

It is a national holiday in many countries like [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Fiji]]. In [[Singapore]], it was a national holiday once but it was removed from [[Singapore]]  holidays. 

Note: In [[Fiji]], Thaipusam is not officially declared as a national holiday, while in certain states of [[Malaysia]] and in the nations of [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Mauritius]] it is a government and a bank holiday.

The word ''Thaipusam'' is a combination of the name of the month, ''Thai'', and the name of a star, ''Pusam''. This particular star is at its highest point during the festival. The festival commemorates the occasion when [[Parvati]] gave [[Murugan]] a [[Vel]] "spear" so he could vanquish the evil demon [[Soorapadman]]. It is commonly believed that Thaipusam marks Murugan's birthday; Some other sources suggest that Vaikhasi Vishakam, which falls in the Vaikhasi month (May/June), is Murugan's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://murugan.org/research/duraiswamy-vaikasi-visakam.htm |title=Vaikasi Visakam and Lord Murukan LALALALA|publisher=Murugan.org |date= |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
This festival was, according to one tradition, said to have been supposedly created during one of the battles between the [[Asuras]] (or to be more specific Soorapadman) and the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]. At one point, the latter were defeated several times by the former. The Devas were unable to resist the onslaught of the Asura forces. In despair, they approached Shiva and entreated to give them an able leader under whose heroic leadership they might obtain victory over the Asuras. They surrendered themselves completely and prayed to Shiva. Shiva granted their request by creating the mighty warrior, Skanda, out of his own power or Achintya Shakti. He at once assumed leadership of the celestial forces, inspired them and defeated the Asura forces and to recognise that day the people created the festival, Thaipusam.

According to Skanda Puranam, the legend of Murugan, and Thirupugal which are divine verses on Murugan, adhere to Shaivam principles. Murugan is the embodiment of Shiva's light and wisdom and devotees pray to him to overcome the obstacles they face, as He is the divine vanquisher of evil. The motive of Thaipusam festival is to pray to God to receive his grace so that bad traits are destroyed.&lt;ref name="Significance of Thaipusam"&gt;[http://omtamil.com/home/significance-of-thaipusam Significance of Thaipusam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213214046/http://omtamil.com/home/significance-of-thaipusam/ |date=13 February 2013 }}, OmTamil published 15 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}

==Kavadi Attam==
The ''[[Kavadi Attam]]'' ("Burden Dance", also written as ''cavadee'') is the ceremonial sacrifice and offering performed by devotees during the worship of [[Murugan]].&lt;ref name="Divinity and Diversity"&gt;Kent, Alexandra. ''Divinity and Diversity: A Hindu Revitalization Movement in Malaysia''. [[University of Hawaii Press]], 2005. ({{ISBN|8791114896}})&lt;/ref&gt; It is often performed during the festival of Thaipusam and emphasizes debt bondage. The ''Kavadi'' itself is a physical burden through which the devotees implore for help from Murugan.&lt;ref name="Portals By Lynne Hume"&gt;Hume, Lynne. ''Portals''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Devotees prepare for the celebration by cleansing themselves through prayer and fasting for 48 days before Thaipusam. ''Kavadi''-bearers have to perform elaborate ceremonies at the time of assuming the ''kavadi'' and at the time of offering it to Murugan. The ''kavadi''-bearer observes celibacy and consumes only certain types of foods known as [[Sattva|Satvik]] food, once a day, while continuously thinking of God. On the day of the festival, devotees shave their heads and undertake a pilgrimage along a set route, while engaging in various acts of devotion, notably carrying various types of ''kavadi'' (burdens).

At its simplest, this may entail carrying a pot of milk, but [[mortification of the flesh]] by piercing the skin, tongue or cheeks with ''vel'' skewers is also common. The simplest ''kavadi'' is a semicircular decorated canopy supported by a wooden rod that is carried on the shoulders to the temple. In addition, some have a small spear through their tongue, or a spear through the cheeks.".&lt;ref name="Palani Thai Pusam"&gt;[http://palani.org/taippucam.htm Palani Thai Pusam], accessed 5 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

A similar practice is performed by the [[Nagarathar]] community in [[Pazhani]], India. This is known as the [[Nagarathar Kavadi]].
