The '''1st Life Grenadier Regiment''' ({{lang-sv|Första livgrenadjärregementet}}), designation '''I 4''', was a [[Swedish Army]] [[infantry]] [[regiment]] that traced its origins back to the 16th century. It was merged into a new regiment in 1927. The regiment's soldiers were recruited from the province of [[Östergötland]].

== History ==
{{seealso|Life Grenadier Regiment (Sweden)#History}}
The regiment has its origins in [[fänika|fänikor]] (companies) raised in [[Östergötland]] in the 16th century. These units later formed [[Östergötland Infantry Regiment]] and [[Östergötland Cavalry Regiment]] which merged in 1791 and formed [[Life Grenadier Regiment (Sweden)|Life Grenadier Regiment]]. This regiment was split in 1816 creating 1st Life Grenadier Regiment and [[2nd Life Grenadier Regiment (Sweden)|2nd Life Grenadier Regiment]].

The regiment was [[Swedish allotment system|allotted]] in 1685. The regiment was given the designation I 4 (4th Infantry Regiment) in a [[general order]] in 1816. 1st Life Grenadier Regiment was then merged with 2nd Life Grenadier Regiment in 1928 to reform the old Life Grenadier Regiment.

The '''Arctic policy of Russia''' is the domestic and [[foreign policy]] of the [[Russian Federation]] with respect to  [[Extreme North (Russia)|the Russian region]] of the [[Arctic]].  The Russian region of the Arctic is defined in the "Russian Arctic Policy" as all Russian possessions located north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. (About one-fifth of Russia's landmass is north of the Arctic Circle.)  Russia is one of five countries bordering the [[Arctic Ocean]]. In 2011, out of 4 million inhabitants of the Arctic, roughly 2 million lived in arctic Russia, making it the largest arctic country by population. However, in recent years Russia's Arctic population has been declining.&lt;ref name=Population&gt;{{cite web | url= http://int.rgo.ru/arctic/arctic-overview/socio-demographic-situation-in-the-arctic/ | title= Socio-demographic situation in the Arctic |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main goals of Russia in its Arctic policy are to utilize its natural resources, protect its [[ecosystems]], use the seas as a transportation system in Russia's interests, and ensure that it remains a zone of peace and cooperation.&lt;ref name=Russian_policy&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.arcticprogress.com/2010/11/russias-arctic-policy/ | title= Russia’s Arctic Policy To 2020 And Beyond |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia currently maintains a military presence in the Arctic and has plans to improve it, as well as strengthen the [[Border Guard Service of Russia|Border Guard/Coast Guard]] presence there. Using the Arctic for economic gain has been done by Russia for centuries for shipping and fishing.  Russia has plans to exploit the large offshore resource deposits in the Arctic. The [[Northern Sea Route]] is of particular importance to Russia for transportation, and the Russian [[Security Council of Russia|Security Council]] is considering projects for its development. The Security Council also stated a need for increasing investment in Arctic infrastructure.&lt;ref name="ITAR-TASS_August_Conference"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c32/199500.html | title=RF ready to contribute to preserving unique Arctic nature - Medvedev| publisher = ITAR-TASS News Agency| date = August 6, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia conducts extensive research in the Arctic region, notably the [[manned drifting ice station]]s and the [[Arktika 2007]] expedition, which was the first to reach the seabed at the [[North Pole]]. The research is partly aimed to back up Russia's territorial claims, in particular those related to Russia's extended [[continental shelf]] in the Arctic Ocean.

==History==
On October 1, 1987, USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev, delivered the Murmansk Initiative stating six goals of the Soviet Union's Arctic foreign policy: establish a nuclear-free zone in Northern Europe; reduce military activity in the Baltic, Northern, Norwegian and Greenland Seas; cooperate on resource development; form an international conference on Arctic scientific research coordination; cooperate in environmental protection and management; and open the Northern Sea Route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/how-gorbachev-shaped-future-arctic-policy-25-years-ago|title=Arctic - How Gorbachev shaped future Arctic policy 25 years ago|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian [[Ministry of Economic Development (Russia)|Ministry of Economic Development]] has identified eight Arctic Support Zones on which funds and projects will be focused, with the aim of fostering the economic potential of the [[Northern Sea Route]] while ensuring that the Russian presence will not be limited to [[resource extraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Technology and government's hand vital for Russian Arctic development|url=http://www.intellinews.com/technology-and-government-s-hand-vital-for-russian-arctic-development-119002/?source=russia|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=bne IntelliNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development wants 210 billion rubles for Arctic regions|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/eye-on-the-arctic/2017/03/07/russias-ministry-of-economic-development-wants-210-billion-rubles-for-arctic-regions/|website=Eye on the Arctic|accessdate=6 April 2017|date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight zones are [[Kolsky District|Kola]], [[Arkhangelsk]], [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug|Nenets]], [[Vorkuta]], [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug|Yamal-Nenets]], [[Taimyr-Turukhan]], [[North Yakutia]] and [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About 40 Arctic projects may be in Russia's Yamal backbone zone — governor|url=http://tass.com/economy/933033|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=TASS|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the North Yakutia area, the project includes reconstruction of the [[Tiksi]] sea port and the port of [[Zelenomysky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=5 billion for development of Tiksi infrastructure|url=https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/industry-and-energy/2017/01/5-billion-development-tiksi-infrastructure|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=The Independent Barents Observer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Arkhangelsk zone, this will include the construction of the {{ill|Belkomur Railway|ru|Белкомур}}.&lt;ref name="nefte"&gt;{{cite news|title=В Минэкономразвития рассмотрели проекты 3 пилотных опорных зон развития арктической зоны РФ|url=http://neftegaz.ru/news/view/152108-V-Minekonomrazvitiya-rassmotreli-proekty-3-pilotnyh-opornyh-zon-razvitiya-arkticheskoy-zony-RF|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=Neftegaz|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration==
{{See also|Arctic exploration}}
The first recorded voyage to the Russian Arctic was by the [[Novgorod]]ian Uleb in 1032, in which he discovered the [[Kara Sea]]. From the 11th to the 16th centuries, Russian coastal dwellers of the [[White Sea]], or [[pomors]], gradually explored other parts of the Arctic coastline, going as far as the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Yenisei River|Yenisey]] rivers, establishing trading posts in [[Mangazeya]]. Continuing the search of [[fur]]s and [[walrus]] and [[mammoth]] [[ivory]], the [[Siberian Cossacks]] under [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] reached the [[Kolyma River]] by 1644. Ivan Moskvitin discovered the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in 1639 and [[Fedot Alekseyev Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] discovered the [[Bering Strait]] in 1648,&lt;ref name=exploration&gt;{{cite web |author = Leonid Sverdlov| url= http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/HistoryCulture/russianexplor.html |title= Russian Naval Officers and Geographic Exploration in Northern Russia (18th through 20th centuries)| publisher = Arctic Voice| date = November 27, 1996 |accessdate=2011-07-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110711223804/http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/HistoryCulture/russianexplor.html| archivedate= 11 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with  Dezhnyov establishing a permanent Russian settlement near the present day [[Anadyr (town)|Anadyr]].

After [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] took the throne, Russia began to develop a [[Russian Navy|navy]] and use it to continue its Arctic exploration. [[Vitus Bering]] explored [[Kamchatka]] in 1728,&lt;ref name=exploration /&gt; while Bering's aides [[Ivan Fyodorov (navigator)|Ivan Fyodorov]] and [[Mikhail Gvozdev]] discovered [[Alaska]] in 1732. The [[Great Northern Expedition]], which lasted from 1733 to 1743, was one of the largest exploration enterprises in history, organized and led by [[Vitus Bering]], [[Aleksei Chirikov]] and a number of other major explorers. A party of the expedition personally led by Bering and Chirikov discovered southern [[Alaska]], the [[Aleutian Islands]] and the [[Commander Islands]],&lt;ref name=northern_expedition1&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.pame.is/amsa/on-focus/53-the-great-northern-expedition |title= The Great Northern Expedition | publisher = Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment Working Group |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the parties led by [[Stepan Malygin]], [[Dmitry Ovtsyn]], [[Fyodor Minin]], [[Semyon Chelyuskin]], [[Vasily Pronchischev]], [[Khariton Laptev]] and [[Dmitry Laptev]] mapped most of the Arctic coastline of Russia (from the White Sea in Europe to the mouth of Kolyma River in Asia).&lt;ref name=northern_expedition2&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_russian1819.html |title= Russian Northern Expeditions (18th-19th centuries)| publisher = Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project |accessdate=2011-07-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718235225/http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_russian1819.html| archivedate= 18 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition resulted in 62 large maps and charts of the Arctic region.&lt;ref name=northern_expedition1 /&gt;

==Territorial claims==

Modern Russian territorial claims to the Arctic officially date back to April 15, 1926, when the Soviet Union claimed land between 32°04'35"E and 168°49'30"W. However, this claim specifically only applied to [[Russian Arctic islands|islands]] and lands within this region.&lt;ref name=Soviet_claim&gt;{{cite web |author = Leonid Timtchenko| url= http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic50-1-29.pdf |title= The Russian Arctic Sectoral Concept: Past And Present| date = June 17, 1996 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first maritime boundary between Russia and Norway, from the [[Varangerfjord]], was signed in 1957. However, tensions resurfaced after both countries made continental shelf claims in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=1957_treaty_norway&gt;{{cite web | author = Thilo Neumann | url= http://www.asil.org/files/2010/insights/insights_101109.pdf | title=Norway and Russia Agree on Maritime Boundary in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean| publisher = The American Society of International Law| date = November 9, 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Informal talks began in the 1970s about determining a boundary in the Barents Sea to settle differing claims,&lt;ref name=1957_treaty_norway /&gt; as Russia wanted the boundary to be a line running straight north from the mainland, {{convert|67,000|mi2}} more than what it had. On September 15, 2010, Foreign Ministers [[Jonas Gahr Støre]] and [[Sergei Lavrov]], of Norway and Russia respectively, signed a treaty that effectively divided the disputed territory in half between the two countries, and also agreed to co-manage resources in that region where they overlap national sectors.&lt;ref name="russia-norway-deal"&gt;{{cite news | author = Walter Gibbs| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/world/europe/28norway.html |title= Russia and Norway Reach Accord on Barents Sea| publisher = ''The New York Times''| date = April 27, 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110727042857/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/world/europe/28norway.html| archivedate= 27 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="russia-norway-deal2"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.eu-norway.org/news1/Treaty-on-maritime-delimitation-and-cooperation-in-the-Barents-Sea-and-the-Arctic-Ocean-signed-today/ |title= Treaty on maritime delimitation and cooperation in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean signed today| publisher = The Norwegian Mission to the EU| date = September 15, 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=globemail_arctic&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Byers | url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/its-time-to-resolve-our-arctic-differences/article1551694/print/ |title= It's time to resolve our Arctic differences |publisher = ''The Globe and Mail''| date = April 30, 2010| accessdate=2011-08-09 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two countries had already been co-managing [[fishery|fisheries]] in the Barents since the 1978 [[Grey Zone Agreement]], which has been renewed annually since it was signed.&lt;ref name=1957_treaty_norway /&gt;&lt;ref name=globemail_arctic /&gt;

On March 12, 1997, Russia ratified the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), which allowed countries to make claims to extended [[continental shelf|continental shelves]].&lt;ref name=UNCLOS&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/status2010.pdf | publisher = United Nations |title= Status of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with UNCLOS, Russia submitted a claim to an extended [[Continental shelf of Russia|continental shelf]] beyond its 200-mile (320&amp;nbsp;km) exclusive economic zone on December 20, 2001, to the [[UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] (CLCS). Russia claimed that two underwater mountain chains - the [[Lomonosov Ridge|Lomonosov]] and [[Mendeleev Ridge|Mendeleev]] ridges - within the Russian sector of the Arctic were extensions of the [[Eurasia]]n continent and thus part of the Russian continental shelf. The UN CLCS neither validated nor invalidated the claim but requested Russia to submit additional data to substantiate its claim.&lt;ref name="2001-claim"&gt;{{cite web |author = Marc Benitah| url= http://www.asil.org/insights071108.cfm |title= Russia's Claim in the Arctic and the Vexing Issue of Ridges in UNCLOS| publisher = American Society of International Law| date = November 8, 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia will submit additional data to the CLCS in 2012.&lt;ref name="next-claim-2012"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.barentsobserver.com/russian-shelf-claim-to-un-in-2012.4940700.html |title= Russian shelf claim to UN in 2012| publisher = ''Barents Observer''| date = July 6, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, a Russian expedition named [[Arktika 2007]], led by [[Artur Chilingarov]], planted a Russian flag on the seabed at the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref name=pole_flag&gt;{{cite news | author = William J.

CNN News.&lt;/ref&gt; He also confirmed that Arctic territory issues "can be tackled solely on the basis of international law, the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|International Convention on the Law of the Sea]] and in the framework of the mechanisms that have in accordance with it been created for determining the borders of states which have a continental shelf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Sergey | last=Lavrov | title=Transcript of Remarks and Replies to Media Questions by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov Following His Participation in the 14th Session of the ASEAN Regional Forum on Security, Manila, Philippines, August 2, 2007 | url=http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/432751A496F921E9C325732C004BE119 | publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia]] | date=2007-08-03 | accessdate=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview Sergey Lavrov said: "I was amazed by my Canadian counterpart’s statement that we are planting flags around.

Foreign Ministers and other officials representing Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States met in [[Ilulissat|Ilulissat, Greenland]] in May 2008, at the [[Arctic Ocean Conference]] and announced the [[Ilulissat Declaration]].  Among other things the declaration stated that any demarcation issues in the Arctic should be resolved on a bilateral basis between contesting parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |title=Conference in Ilulissat, Greenland: Landmark political declaration on the future of the Arctic |url=http://www.um.dk/en/servicemenu/News/ConferenceInIlulissatGreenlandLandmarkPoliticalDeclarationOnTheFutureOfTheArctic.htm |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2008-06-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615022625/http://www.um.dk/en/servicemenu/News/ConferenceInIlulissatGreenlandLandmarkPoliticalDeclarationOnTheFutureOfTheArctic.htm |archivedate=2008-06-15 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.um.dk/NR/rdonlyres/BE00B850-D278-4489-A6BE-6AE230415546/0/ArcticOceanConference.pdf |title=The Ilulissat Declaration |date=2008-05-28 |publisher=um.dk |accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Russia has conducted research in the Arctic for decades. The country is the only one that uses [[North Pole drift ice station|drift stations]]- research facilities seasonally deployed on [[drift ice]]- and also has other research stations in its Arctic zone. The first drift station, [[North Pole-1]], was established on May 21, 1937 by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=drift_stations&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_drifting.html |title= North Pole Drifting Stations (1930s-1980s) |publisher = Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project | accessdate=2011-07-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720113545/http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_drifting.html| archivedate= 20 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russian research has focused on the Arctic seabed, marine life, meteorology, exploration, and natural resources, among other topics. Recent research has also been focusing on studying the Lomonosov Ridge to collect evidence that could strengthen Russian territorial claims to the seabed in that region within the Russian sector of the Arctic.&lt;ref name=drift_stations /&gt;&lt;ref name=research1&gt;{{cite web | url= http://blogs.nature.com/news/2010/09/russia_to_boost_arctic_researc.html |title= Russia to boost Arctic research |date = September 23, 2010| accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the summer of 2015, Russia built an extremely large military base on the island of [[Alexandra Land]], expanding on an already established airbase called [[Nagurskoye]], on the [[80th parallel north|80th parallel]]. The new complex is made of multiple inter-connected buildings and can house a company of 150 soldiers for up to 18 months without the need of re-supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/10/21/world/russia-asserts-arctic-clout-opens-large-military-complex-80th-parallel/#.VihEhpVRHs1|title=Russia asserts Arctic clout, opens large military complex on 80th parallel|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Arctic ice.jpg|280px|thumb|alt=Photograph of ice in the Arctic Ocean. |Reduction in Arctic ice due to climate change may open up more economic opportunities in the Arctic.]]
Russia's economic interests in the Arctic are based on two things - natural resources and maritime transport.&lt;ref name=geopolitics_economy&gt;{{cite web | author = Katarzyna Zysk| url= http://www.geopoliticsnorth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=71&amp;limitstart=4 |title= Russia, Norway and the High North - past, present, future - Russian Arctic Strategy |publisher = Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies| date = September 2008 | accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Northern Sea Route]], in use for centuries and officially defined by Russian legislation, is an Arctic [[shipping]] lane that stretches from the Barents Sea to the Bering Strait through Arctic waters. Travel along Northern Sea Route takes only one-third the distance needed to go through the [[Suez Canal]], without as high a risk of [[pirates]].&lt;ref name=Northern_Route_development&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.barentsobserver.com/future-bases-for-the-northern-sea-route-pointed-out.4863371-16149.html | title=Future bases for the Northern Sea Route pointed out| publisher = ''Barents Observer''| date = December 17, 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The route is currently open for up to eight weeks a year, and studies are predicting that [[climate change]] will lead to further reduction in Arctic ice, which can lead to greater use of the route.&lt;ref name=marine_transport1&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.arctic.ru/economy-infrastructure/maritime-transport |title= Sea Routes and Marine Transport |publisher = Friends of the Arctic| accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marine_transport2&gt;{{cite web | url= http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/northern-sea-route-and-the-northwest-passage-compared-with-currently-used-shipping-routes |title= Northern Sea Routes and the Northwest Passage compared with currently used shipping routes |publisher = United Nations Environment Programme| accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when "open" this route is not totally ice free and requires Russian icebreaker and navigational support to ensure safety of passage.

The [[Yamal Peninsula]], home to Russia's biggest natural gas reserves, was connected to the rest of Russia by [[Gazprom]] through the creation of the [[Obskaya–Bovanenkovo Line]], which opened in 2010. This was part of Gazprom's [[Yamal project]] to develop natural gas resources in the Yamal Peninsula.&lt;ref name=Arctic_railway&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.barentsobserver.com/arctic-railway-launched.4892021.html | title=Arctic railway launched| publisher = ''Barents Observer''| date = March 3, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian Railways]] plans to connect [[Indiga (village)|Indiga]], which is being considered as a prime location for the construction of a [[deepwater port]], and [[Amderma]], site of the [[Amderma Airport]], to its railway system by 2030.&lt;ref name=Northern_Route_development /&gt; Prime Minister Putin also announced that a year-round port would be constructed on the [[Yamal Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=port_yamal&gt;{{cite web | author = Jeff Davis| url= http://www.canada.com/news/Russia+launches+Arctic+expedition+beefs+military+presence/5060448/story.html |title= Russia launches Arctic expedition, beefs up military presence |publisher = Postmedia News| date = July 6, 2011| accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But so far, Russia’s concentration on production of oil and gas on the Yamal Peninsula met with huge challenges.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Staun, Jørgen. [http://www.fak.dk/publikationer/Documents/Russias%20Strategy%20in%20the%20Arctic.pdf “Russia’s Strategy in the Arctic.]” Institute for Strategy, The Royal Danish Defence College. Copenhagen. March 2015. Web. 11 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In attempting to extract gas and oil in the Arctic region, Gazprom encounter harsh climate and the long lines of communication. So Gazprom requires large investments with high risk and a long investment horizon and is dependent on the energy prices continuing to be high so that the extraction is profitable. International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that the majority of the Arctic fields are not profitable if the world market price of oil is below 120 dollars per barrel. At the time of this writing (May 11, 2017), the price of Brent oil has fallen to around 50 dollars per barrel. Meanwhile, since Russian law only allows for the state energy companies Gazprom (mainly gas) and Rosneft (mainly oil) to extract oil and gas from the continental shelf – but since these two firms do not have at their own disposal the necessary technological expertise – they have entered into partnerships with a number of foreign firms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Russian Government is also attempting to increase foreign investment in its Arctic resources. In August 2011 [[Rosneft]], a Russian government-operated oil company, signed a deal with [[ExxonMobil]] in which Rosneft received some of Exxon's global oil assets in exchange for the joint development of Russian Arctic resources by both companies.&lt;ref name="Exxon-Rosneft"&gt;{{cite news | author = Andrew Kramer |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/business/global/exxon-and-rosneft-partner-in-russian-oil-deal.html | title= Exxon Reaches Arctic Oil Deal With Russians |date = August 30, 2011| accessdate=2011-09-05 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement includes a $3.2 billion [[hydrocarbon exploration]] of the Kara and Black seas (although the Black Sea is not in the Arctic),&lt;ref name=Exxon_joint_exploration&gt;{{cite news | author = Melodie Warner |url= https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110830-709465.html | title= Exxon Mobil, Rosneft To Jointly Develop Hydrocarbon Resources Globally  |publisher = ''The Wall St. Journal''| date = August 30, 2011| accessdate=2011-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the joint development of ice-resistant drilling platforms and other Arctic technologies.&lt;ref name="Guardian-deal-research"&gt;{{cite web|author=Roger Howard |url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/business-views/163674-how-arctic-oil-could-break-new-ground.html |title=How Arctic oil could break new ground |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=September 4, 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802035336/http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/business-views/163674-how-arctic-oil-could-break-new-ground.html |archivedate=August 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This deal followed a failed attempt at a similar cooperation between Rosneft and [[BP]] in May.&lt;ref name="Exxon-Rosneft" /&gt; [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] is currently in talks with Rosneft about jointly developing Arctic resources.&lt;ref name=Kara_mapping_Rosneft&gt;{{cite web | author = Atle Staalesen |url= http://www.barentsobserver.com/rosneft-prepares-for-kara-sea-mapping.4955742-16178.html | title= Rosneft prepares for Kara Sea mapping |publisher = ''Barents Observer''| date = September 5, 2011| accessdate=2011-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CNN International''' ('''CNNI''', on-air branding simply as '''CNN'''), is an international [[pay television]] channel that is operated by [[CNN]]. CNN International carries news-related programming programming worldwide; it cooperates with parent network [[CNN]]'s national and international news bureaus. Unlike its sister channel, [[CNN]], a US-only subscription service which is mostly broadcast from CNN studios in [[New York City]] and [[Atlanta]], CNN International is carried on a variety of TV platforms across the world, and mostly broadcast from studios outside the US, in [[London]], [[Mumbai]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Abu Dhabi]]. In some countries, it is available as a [[free-to-air]] network. The current managing director of CNN International is Tony Maddox.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/cnn-international-documentary-bahrain-arab-spring-repression Why didn't CNN's international arm air its own documentary on Bahrain's Arab Spring repression?] CNNi's president, Tony Maddox&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early years===
[[Image:CNN-International-Logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from 1985 to 1995.]]
CNN International, in large part a result of [[Ted Turner]]'s globalization ideals, began broadcasting on September 1, 1985, at first primarily broadcasting to American business travelers in hotels. The first studio for CNNI was at CNN's original studio building known as Techwood, home at that time to all of Turner Broadcasting System's channels. Today, it is home to the Turner Studios complex that houses the entertainment channels. Other early studios in Atlanta were tucked away in various corners of the [[CNN Center]], and the newsroom lacked even a [[digital clock]]. The vast majority of the network's programming originally consisted of simulcasts of the two domestic CNN channels ([[CNN|CNN/US]] and [[HLN (TV channel)|Headline News]]). In 1990, however, the amount of news programming produced by CNNI especially for international viewers increased significantly. A new newsroom and studio complex was built in 1994, as CNN decided to compete against [[BBC World Service Television]]'s news programming. CNNI emerged as an internationally oriented news channel, with staff members of various national backgrounds, even though some accusations of a pro-U.S. editorial bias persist. CNN International was awarded the [[Liberty Medal]] on July 4, 1997. Ted Turner, in accepting the medal on behalf of the network, said: "My idea was, we're just going to give people the facts... We didn't have to show liberty and democracy as good, and show socialism or totalitarianism as bad. If we just showed them both the way they were ... clearly everybody's going to choose liberty and democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/libertymedal/recipient_1997.html|title=CNN International - National Constitution Center|website=National Constitution Center – constitutioncenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New international era (1995–2006)===
[[Image:CNN International.png|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from February 1, 1995, to December 31, 2005.]]
In 1995, creative director Morgan Almeida defined a progressive rebranding strategy, to target CNNI's diverse global market, making the on-air look less overtly American and with a cleaner, simpler "international" aesthetic going forward. The word "International" in the channel's logo was replaced with a globe, and the new branding featured numerous international locations filmed in time-lapse, channel idents created in CGI with Velvet Design in Munich, and a news brand designed with The Attik in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/news/cnni/idents.html|title=CNN International &amp;#124; Idents|publisher=TVARK|date=|accessdate=2016-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054454/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/news/cnni/idents.html#|archive-date=March 4, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006–2009 revamp===
[[Image:CNN-globe-logo.png|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from January 1, 2006, to September 21, 2009.]]
The network undertook another major rebranding effort in 2006 overseen by Mark Wright and London agency Kemistry. The ticker was replaced by a flipper, on-screen graphics were more unified and from October 2007 until August 2008, new studios were progressively rolled out. However, on January 1, 2009, CNN International adopted the "lower-thirds" that CNN/US had introduced a month earlier which were inspired by the clean modern design of the CNNI rebrand efforts.

In the U.S., CNNI North America was distributed overnight and on weekends over the [[CNNfn]] financial channel, until that channel's demise in December 2004. It is now available as a standalone, full-time channel, usually as part of high-tier packages of subscription providers including [[Time Warner Cable]], [[AT&amp;T U-Verse]], [[Verizon FiOS]] and [[Cox Communications]].

===Going beyond borders (2009–2013)===
Throughout January until September 2009, CNN International adapted more programs that became geared towards a primetime European audience with a few titled after CNN International personalities, most notably the interview program Amanpour. On September 21, 2009, the channel launched a new tagline "Go Beyond Borders", along with a new logo, and consolidated its general newscasts (''World News'', ''CNN Today'', ''World News Asia'', ''World News Europe'' and ''Your World Today'') into a single newscast entitled ''World Report''.

The slogan "Go Beyond Borders" emphasizes the international perspective that gives the information in this string and the plurality of the audiences. With this tagline, CNN also refers to the various platforms to disseminate their contents. The new image was created by the creativity and marketing department, and agency CNN Tooth &amp; Nail. An important element of the rebrand was a new evening program that adds the broadcast of programs ''Amanpour'' and ''World One''. The makeover of CNN International has subject to a lot of criticism on both the new prime time lineup and the redesigned graphics.

On January 11, 2009, in a bid to compete directly with [[Al Jazeera]]'s then English-language international channel, the network launched a new production center: CNN [[Abu Dhabi]], based in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Then, CNN International adapted half-hour shows in its schedule with a new evening prime program for [[Middle East]] viewers, ''Prism''.

In 2010, CNN International launched new programs for its evening lineup in order to improve its schedule. In 2011, programs from CNN U.S. were added to the CNN International schedule, including the talk program ''[[Piers Morgan Live]]'' which was later cancelled and replaced with [[CNN Tonight]] hosted by Don Lemon.
[[Image:CNN International 2009.svg|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from 2009 to 2014.]]

===This is CNN (2013–present)===
"This is CNN" represents CNN International's rebrand with new sets and output in full 16:9 high definition. The "This is CNN" slogan is also used on its sister network [[CNN/U.S.]]

==Regional and online versions==
There are six variants of CNN International:
* [[CNN International Asia Pacific]], based in [[Hong Kong SAR]],
* [[CNN International Europe/Middle East/Africa]], based in London, [[United Kingdom]]
* [[CNN International Latin America]], based in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.
* [[CNN International Middle East]], based in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]]
* CNN International North America, based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.
* [[CNN International South Asia]], based in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]

The schedules of the different regional versions no longer differ significantly from each other, but there are still minor variations such as weather updates and show airtimes - notably ''Amanpour'', which also airs at 22.00 HK time in Asia in lieu of the first half-hour of International Desk, and 23.00 CET in Europe in addition to its original airtime.

CNN has reported that its broadcast agreement in mainland China includes an arrangement that its signal must pass through a Chinese-controlled satellite. With this method of transmission, Chinese authorities have been able to black out CNNI segments at will. CNN has also said that its broadcasts are not widely available in mainland China, but rather only in certain diplomatic compounds, hotels, and apartment blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vause|first=John|title=San Francisco Torch Relay Broadcast|publisher=CNN|date=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, CNN International was made available online in the United States for [[TV Everywhere|CNN/U.S subscribers on participating television providers]] through the CNNgo service.&lt;ref name="tvnewser-cnngo"&gt;{{cite web|title=CNN International Now Available on CNNgo|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/cnn-international-now-available-on-cnngo/266213|website=TVNewser|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulcasts between CNNI and CNN/US==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
Although dramatically scaled down since its early days, CNNI currently (as of mid 2017) draws from the feed of the main CNN channel for all editions of ''[[The Lead with Jake Tapper]]'', ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'', the first hour of Monday through Thursday editions of ''[[CNN Tonight]]'', the first hour of weekday editions of ''[[New Day (TV series)|New Day]]'', ''[[Smerconish]]'', the Sunday edition of ''[[Inside Politics]]'', ''[[State of the Union (TV series)|State of the Union]]'', ''[[Fareed Zakaria GPS]]'', ''[[Reliable Sources]]'' and some ''[[CNN Special Investigations Unit]]'' documentaries.  The ticker and timepiece of CNN/US are replaced by those of CNNI, although CNN/US's red logo on a white field is retained in the on-screen graphic (rather than replaced by CNNI's white logo on a red field), signifying CNN/US as the originating source.

CNNI also simulcasts CNN/U.S. newscasts whenever major events happen in the United States or around the world. Examples include the [[death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|death and funeral of Ronald Reagan]], the crash of [[Colgan Air Flight 3407|Continental Airlines Flight 3407]] in the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] suburb of [[Clarence Center, New York|Clarence Center]], the Hudson River plane landing, the attempted Christmas Day bombing of flight 253 and the death and memorial service of [[Michael Jackson]] as well as scheduled events such as U.S. elections, Presidential inaugurations and the annual [[New Year's Eve Live (CNN program)|New Year's Eve]] ball drop from [[Times Square]].

Likewise, CNN/U.S. occasionally turns to CNNI newscasts, primarily when major international news breaks during overnight hours in the U.S. A notable case was during the [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|death of Pope John Paul II]] and the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London Underground bombings of July 7, 2005]]. CNN/U.S. simulcast CNNI coverage of the death of [[Pakistan]]'s former Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] on the night after her assassination took place. Simulcasts also happened from November 27 to 29, 2008, due to the terror attacks in [[Mumbai, India]], on January 4, 2009, when Israel launched strikes into Gaza, and during the early hours of January 14, 2010, due to the earthquake in Haiti.

From 2005 until early 2008, CNNI's ''[[Your World Today]]'' aired on CNN/U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Home+ |url=http://edition.cnn.com/CNNI/ |title=Breaking News, Latest News and Videos - CNN.com |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the 12–1 p.m. ET timeslot. That program was initially pre-empted by ''Issue #1'', a program dealing in the American economic, financial, and housing sectors as part of the lead-up to the [[2008 U.S. presidential election]], and permanently replaced by another hour of ''[[CNN Newsroom]]'' in September 2008.

During the [[2008 Atlanta tornado outbreak|Atlanta tornado outbreak in March 2008]], CNN/U.S. and CNNI simulcasted coverage after ''Anderson Cooper 360°'' ended. That coverage ended around 12:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. EDT and the channels resumed their normal programming. Furthermore, the next day, with storms impending, CNN/U.S. had to move onto CNNI's U.S. news set and weather center to avoid water from possible flooding during the storms.

On January 17, 2011, CNN/U.S. dropped its early morning rebroadcasts of ''[[In the Arena|ParkerSpitzer]]'' and ''Anderson Cooper 360°'' during the 4–6 a.m. ET time period, and began to simulcast ''World Business Today'' and ''World One'' from CNNI in those slots. Both newscasts are the only programs broadcast entirely in [[4:3]] fullscreen frames on CNN/U.S.' standard-definition and high-definition feeds (the SD feed of CNN/US switched to a [[widescreen]] [[letterbox]] screen format on January 11, 2011). ''World One'' was dropped from CNN/U.S. just a few months later to allow the addition of an extra hour of ''American Morning'' which has been replaced with ''[[Early Start]]''.

As of August 2014, following [[Ferguson unrest|the unrest]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], a permanent simulcast of CNNI's block of ''Newsroom'' with [[Rosemary Church]] and [[Errol Barnett]] was added to the late-night lineup of CNN/U.S., serving as a lead-in to ''Early Start''. In late 2015, [[John Vause]] and anchor [[Isha Sesay]] began to anchor a two-hour block of the simulcast from CNN studios in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="tvnewser-la"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Vause, Isha Sesay To Anchor CNN International Show From Los Angeles|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/john-vause-isha-sesay-to-anchor-cnn-international-show-from-los-angeles/268296|website=TVNewser|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High definition==
'''CNN International HD''' is the [[high definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of the channel broadcasting at 1920x[[1080i]], which was launched in September 2012. Prior to 3 June 2013, only programming from CNN US were available natively in HD, while shows made for CNN International were produced in [[4:3]] [[576i]]. In February 2013, the European SD feed of CNN International began broadcasting in widescreen by downscaling the HD feed, which resulted in all 4:3-native programming being broadcast in [[pillarbox]] until the June 3 switchover, finalising on 17 June of the same year, when the switchover was completed.

In late 2010, the American CNN channel became available in HD to viewers in [[Japan]] under the name '''CNN HD'''. The CNN U.S. domestic version (both SD and HD) is also available on Greater China-based satellite service [[DishHD]] (subsidiary of [[Dish Network]] in U.S.).

On 28 June 2016, CNN International HD was launched for Sky customers in the UK, on channel 506 or 579, making the [[Arirang (TV network)|next news channel]] launch in the 600's, as it is next to the [[God TV|GOD Channel]].

==Online==
CNN debuted its news website CNN.com (initially an experiment known as ''CNN Interactive'') on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of [[blogs]], [[social media]] and [[user-generated content]] have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of [[CNN Pipeline]] in late 2005. In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S. according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.

CNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or "pipes"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up "news alerts" to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running [[Microsoft Windows]]. There was also a browser-based "web client" that did not require installation. In July 2007, the service was discontinued and replaced with a free streaming service.

The now-defunct topical news program ''[[Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics]]'' was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/columnist/mediamix/2005-03-20-media-mix_x.htm|title=It's prime time for blogs on CNN's 'Inside Politics'|date=2005-03-20|publisher=USA Today|last=Johnson|first=Peter|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blog coverage was expanded when ''[[Inside Politics]]'' was folded into ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|The Situation Room]]''. In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and [[CNN iReport]], initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from [[blogging]] to [[citizen journalism]] within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the [[Virginia Tech shootings]] sent-in first hand photos of what was going during the shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=250570b8-2555-4ac0-8fb7-a0431a321e0d&amp;k=80562|title='Citizen journalist' often there first to snap photos|date=2008-04-12|publisher=Regina Leader-Post|last=Cobb|first=Chris|accessdate=2009-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621203445/http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=250570b8-2555-4ac0-8fb7-a0431a321e0d&amp;k=80562#|archive-date=June 21, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to those who receive CNN at home.&lt;ref name="CNNlivestreaming"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/flashLive/live.html |title=CNN.com Live |website=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the [[RealNetworks]] SuperPass subscription outside the U.S. CNN also offers several [[RSS|RSS feeds]] and [[podcast]]s.

On April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel's coverage on the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]]. CNN reported that they took preventative measures after news broke of the impending attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/04/18/cnn.websites/ |title=CNN Web site targeted - CNN.com |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claburn, Thomas: "[http://www.informationweek.com/government/cybersecurity/cnn-faces-cyberattack-over-tibet-coverage/d/d-id/1066964? CNN Faces Cyberattack Over Tibet Coverage]" [[InformationWeek]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The company was honored at the 2008 [[Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award]]s for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP-based live, edit and store-and-forward digital newsgathering system.

On October 24, 2009 CNN launched a new version of the CNN.com website, revamping it adding a new "sign up" option where users may create their own user name, a new "CNN Pulse" (beta) feature along with a new red color theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/relaunch/|title=Welcome to the New CNN.com&amp;nbsp;– Interactive tour |publisher=CNN|accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the news archived on the website has been deleted. CNN also has a channel in the popular video-sharing site [[YouTube]], but its videos can only be viewed in the United States, a source of criticism among YouTube users worldwide.{{Cn|date=May 2018}}

In April 2010, CNN announced via [[Twitter]] its upcoming food [[blog]] called "Eatocracy," in which it will "cover all news related to food&amp;nbsp;– from recalls to health issues to culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brion|first=Raphael|title=Eatocracy: CNN Gets in the Food Blog Business|url=http://eater.com/archives/2010/04/13/eatocracy-cnn-gets-in-the-food-blog-business.php|work=Eater.com|date=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN had an [[internet relay chat]] (IRC) network at chat.cnn.com. CNN placed a live chat with [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] on the network in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/community/netanyahu/Net1getready.html |title=CNN Community |website=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNN also maintains a [[wire service]] known as CNN Wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/intlsyndication/wire.html|title=CNN Syndication Services|website=www.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Image:CNN International.jpg|thumb|right|The CNN International logo on a table viewed inside the CNN Center in Atlanta. These tables have since been removed.]]

=== Accusations of US-centric viewpoint ===
Former CNN Beijing and Tokyo bureau chief [[Rebecca MacKinnon]] described how the news-gathering priorities of CNN International were skewed to "produce stories and reports that would be of interest to CNN USA." Nevertheless, [[Jane Arraf]], a former correspondent who was with the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and later served as a Middle East-based correspondent for [[Al Jazeera English]], noted that when she spoke on international affairs, CNN International would usually give her more airtime than CNN/US. For its own part, former CNN executive [[Eason Jordan]] has defended CNN International's "international" perspective, saying "No matter what CNN International does, as long as CNN's headquarters is in the United States people are going to say, well, it's an American service. But the reality is that it's an international service based in the United States, and we don't make any apologies about that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Spring02/jordan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230185016/http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Spring02/jordan.html |archivedate=December 30, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of anti-Israel bias ===
In 2002, [[Honest Reporting]] spearheaded a campaign to expose CNN for pro-Palestinian bias, citing public remarks in which [[Ted Turner]] equated Palestinian suicide bombing with Israeli military strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jun/18/terrorismandthemedia.israel|title=CNN chief accuses Israel of terror &amp;#124; Media|date=|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|author1=Oliver Burkeman|author2=Peter Beaumont|accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 2014, a misleading headline was posted by CNN. Two Palestinian terrorists had entered a synagogue with knives and a gun, killing four Jewish worshippers and wounding seven. The headline stated instead that two Palestinian were killed by Israeli police, thus equating the perpetrators of the massacre of Jews with the killing of the armed terrorists. The headline failed to mention the four Jews who were murdered in this [[2014 Jerusalem synagogue attack]]. CNN stated that the attack occurred at a mosque, when in fact the synagogue was attacked, compounding the bias.&lt;ref name="JohnsonA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Alan|title=Blaming Israel for Palestinian violence is racist: it denies that Arabs are moral agents|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/11243168/Blaming-Israel-for-Palestinian-violence-is-racist-it-denies-that-Arabs-are-moral-agents.html|accessdate=November 21, 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cnn-apologizes-screen-text-used-750235 CNN apologizes for bias], Hollywoodreporter.com; accessed November 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/2014/dgreenfield/cnn-describes-muslim-terror-attack-on-synagogue-as-attack-on-mosque/ |title=CNN Describes Muslim Terror Attack on Synagogue as Israel Killing Palestinians |publisher=Frontpage Mag |date=2014-11-18 |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of pro-American bias ===
CNN is one of the world's largest news organizations, and its international channel, CNN International is the leading international news channel in terms of viewer reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/about/|title=About Us|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/563911/cnn-tops-european-news-channels-according-ems/|title=CNN tops European news channels according to EMS&amp;nbsp;– Brand Republic News|publisher=Brand Republic |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the BBC and its network of reporters and bureaus, CNN International makes extensive use of affiliated reporters that are local to, and often directly affected by, the events they are reporting. The effect is a more immediate, less detached style of on-the-ground coverage. This has done little to stem criticism, largely from Middle Eastern nations, that CNN International reports news from a pro-American perspective. This is a marked contrast to domestic criticisms that often portray CNN as having a "liberal" or "anti-American" bias.

=== Accusations of anti-China bias ===
A Chinese website, [[anti-cnn]].com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m4.cn |title=四月网_M4.CN_全球视野,中国情怀 |website=M4.cn |date=2015-06-01 |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; has accused CNN and western media in general of biased reporting against China, with the catchphrase "Don't be so CNN" catching on in the Chinese mainstream as jokingly meaning "Don't be so biased". Pictures used by CNN are allegedly edited to have completely different meanings from the original ones. In addition, the channel was accused of largely ignoring pro-China voices during the Olympic Torch Relay debacle in San Francisco.

On July 7, 2010, [[Octavia Nasr]], senior Middle East editor and a CNN journalist for 20 years, was fired after she expressed admiration on her [[Twitter]] account for a militant Muslim cleric and former Hezbollah leader who had recently died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CNN Mideast Affairs editor loses post after tweeting her respect for militant cleric|first=Matea|last=Gold|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-07-07|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/07/cnn-mideast-affairs-editor-loses-post-after-tweeting-her-respect-for-militant-cleric.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of propaganda and censorship ===
In October 2011, [[Amber Lyon]] claimed to the Syrian government news agency SANA that she had been directed by CNN to report selectively, repetitively, and falsely in order to sway public opinion in favor of direct American aggression against [[Iran]] and [[Syria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sana.sy/eng/22/2013/03/30/475112.htm |title=Ex-CNN Reporter: I Received Orders to Manipulate News to Demonize Syria and Iran |accessdate=2012-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402001657/http://sana.sy/eng/22/2013/03/30/475112.htm |archivedate=April 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that this was common practice under CNN. She subsequently repeated this claim, addressing the degraded state of [[journalistic ethics]] in an interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/alex-jones-americas-top-conspiracy-theorist.html |title=An Interview With Alex Jones, America’s Leading (and Proudest) Conspiracy Theorist |website=Nymag.com |date=2013-11-17 |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=YouTube is NOT a reliable source|date=December 2015}} during which she also discussed the Bahraini episode, suggesting paid-for content was also taken from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], and other states, that the [[War on Terrorism]] had also been employed as a pretext to pre-empt substantive [[investigative journalism]] within the U.S., and that following the Bahrain reporting, her investigative department had been terminated and "reorganized", and her severance and [[employee benefits]] used as a threat to intimidate and attempt to purchase her subsequent silence.

Lyon claimed to have met with [[Tony Maddox]], president of CNN International, twice about this issue in 2011 and had claimed that during the second meeting she was threatened and intimated to stop speaking on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Glenn Greenwald |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/cnn-international-documentary-bahrain-arab-spring-repression |title=Why didn't CNN's international arm air its own documentary on Bahrain's Arab Spring repression? &amp;#124; Glenn Greenwald &amp;#124; US news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN issued a detailed response to Lyon's claims about its coverage of Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/05/cnn-internationals-response-to-the-guardian/ | work=CNN | title=CNN International's Response to the Guardian – Update | date=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyon also claimed on the Russian news channel [[RT (TV network)|RT]] that CNN reporters, headed by Maddox, have been instructed to over-cover Iran as a form of propaganda, and that CNN International has been paid by the Bahraini government to produce and air news segments intentionally painting them in a positive light.{{citation needed|reason=YouTube is NOT a reliable source|date=December 2015}}

'''"Canta y sé feliz"'''  ({{IPA-es|ˈkanta i ˈse feˈliθ}}, {{lang|en|"Sing and Be Happy"}}) was the [[Spain|Spanish]] entry to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974]] in [[Brighton]], [[United Kingdom]]. It was sung in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by [[Peret]].

The song is an up-tempo belonging to the [[Catalan rumba]] genre, with both music and lyrics by Pedro Pubill Calaf - Peret himself.

On the night of the final, the song performed in the third position, following [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Olivia Newton-John]] singing "[[Long Live Love (Olivia Newton-John song)|Long Live Love]]" and preceding [[Norway]]'s [[Anne-Karine Strøm]] with "[[The First Day of Love]]", and at the close of the voting had received 10 points, placing 9th in a field of 17.

It was succeeded as [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spanish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975 contest]] by [[Sergio y Estíbaliz]]  with  "[[Tú volverás]]

The '''''Confédération syndicale belge''''' (''Belgian Trade Union Confederation'') was an [[Anarcho-syndicalist]] [[trade union]] movement in [[Belgium]]. The organization was founded in [[Liège]] on 19 April 1908. ''Confédération syndicale belge'' was the last of the various anarcho-syndicalist union movements formed in Belgium in the years prior to the [[First World War]]. The organization had around 10,000 members from [[Antwerp]], [[Kortrijk]], [[Brussels]], [[Verviers]], the [[La Louvière|Centre region]] and [[Liège]]. It was formed by the small revolutionary ''Confédération générale du travail'' (founded on 28 January 1906 in Brussels), the Antwerp diamond workers union (3,000 members), the glass workers union (''Union Verrière'') of [[Lodelinsart]] and others in reaction to the creation of the ''Commission syndicale'', a trade-union confederation directly linked to, and under the orders of the [[Belgian Labour Party]]. In January 1910, the diamond workers union finally joined the ''Commission syndicale'' after a mediation by [[Camille Huysmans]] and [[:nl:Jan Van Zutphen|Jan Van Zutphen]], general secretary of the diamond general trade union of [[Amsterdam]], the ''[[:nl:Algemene Nederlandse Diamantbewerkersbond|Algemene Nederlandse Diamantbewerkersbond]]''. This ended the history of the ''Confédération syndicale belge'', the last attempt to create a trade union independent from the [[Belgian Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Maxime Steinberg, "[http://www.blocml.be/clartedocument/clartedoc07/clartedoc07.php A l'origine du communisme belge: L'extrême-gauche révolutionnaire d'avant 1914]", ''[http://www.cahiers-marxistes.be/cahier/8/cahiers-marxistes-8 Cahiers marxistes (Brussels)]'' n°8, Dec.-Feb. 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fall of Communism in Albania''', the last such event in [[Europe]] outside the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], started in earnest on December 1990 with student demonstrations in the capital, [[Tirana]], although protests had begun earlier that year in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvklan.al/emisioni.php?id=2512# Mysteries of December 1990 (Misteret e Dhjetoret)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211110848/http://tvklan.al/emisioni.php?id=2512 |date=2011-02-11 }}, [[TV Klan]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Committee of the communist [[Party of Labour of Albania]] allowed political pluralism on 11 December and the largest opposition party, the [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democratic Party]], was founded the next day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Albania: From Dictatorship to Democracy|last = Abrahams|first = Fred C.|publisher = NYU Press|year = 2015|isbn = 0814705111|location = New York|pages = 169–221|url = http://www.modern-albania.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albanian Constitutional Assembly election, 1991|March 1991 elections]] left the Party of Labour in power, but a general strike and urban opposition led to the formation of a "stability government" that included non-communists. Albania's former communists were routed in [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1992|elections in March 1992]] amid economic collapse and social unrest, with the Democratic Party winning most seats and its party head, [[Sali Berisha]], becoming president.

==Background==
[[Enver Hoxha]], who ruled the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]] for four decades, died on April 11, 1985.  [[Ramiz Alia]] succeeded Hoxha, and gradually introduced economic reforms and opened diplomatic ties with [[Western Europe]]an countries.&lt;ref name="Lami"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aimpress.org/dyn/trae/archive/data/199912/91216-007-trae-tir.htm |title=Albania: nine years after |last=Lami |first=Remzi |work=AIM Tirana |accessdate=21 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803105204/http://www.aimpress.org/dyn/trae/archive/data/199912/91216-007-trae-tir.htm |archivedate=August 3, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[revolutions of 1989]] many Albanians remained unaware of events due to the dearth of information within the isolated state. Some Albanians did not even know that the [[Berlin Wall]] had fallen in November 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Albania and the European Union: the tumultuous journey towards integration |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=21 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=32Wu8H7t8MwC&amp;pg=PA22 |accessdate= 2011-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1990, the first revolts started in [[Shkodra]], where a few hundred people wanted to demolish [[Joseph Stalin]]'s statue, and from there they spread to a few other cities. Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to [[Albanian passport|travel abroad]]. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world.

[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had adopted new policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1985. After [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], the communist leader of [[Romania]], was executed during the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Alia knew that he might be next if radical changes were not made. He then signed the [[Helsinki Agreement]] which then forced conformity to Western European human rights standards. Alia also organized a meeting with leading intellectuals of the time on ways to reform the Albanian political system. Under Alia, the first pluralist elections took place since the communists took power in Albania in 1944. Alia's party won the election of March 31, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_democracy/election_watch/v002/index.html|title=Project MUSE - Journal of Democracy|author=|date=|website=muse.jhu.edu|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it was clear that the transition to capitalism would not be stopped.  Many leading members of the newly formed [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democratic Party]] wore light trench coats during demonstrations, while [[Sali Berisha]], then still a Party of Labour member, was heard thanking Ramiz Alia when addressing the students protests, and was seen driving around [[Skanderbeg Square]] with a government vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKUaRnSwKkA&amp;feature=related|title=Sali Berisha cun i ri|first=|last=Lenci lorenc|date=17 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbRz4QZWtPY|title=I Panjohuri|first=|last=OLTIONPENGU|date=25 June 2009|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a student demonstration was crushed by the state police in Tirana's Student City dormitories. Ramiz Alia invited a delegation of University of Tirana students to discuss their concerns and come up with a compromise.

The communists managed to retain control of the government in the first round of elections, but fell two months later during a general strike. A committee of "national salvation" took over but also collapsed within six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_democracy/election_watch/v003/index.html#v003.3|title=Project MUSE - Journal of Democracy|author=|date=|website=muse.jhu.edu|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alia resigned as president and was succeeded by Berisha, the first democratically elected leader of Albania since Bishop [[Fan Noli]].

==Post-socialist government==
The change from socialism to capitalism evidently had many challenges. The Democratic Party had to implement the reforms it had promised, but they were either too slow or did not solve the nation's problems, so people were disappointed when their hopes for fast prosperity went unfulfilled. Many Albanians were also frustrated by Sali Berisha's growing authoritarianism, including pressure on the opposition, media and civil society.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, [https://www.hrw.org/report/1996/03/01/human-rights-post-communist-albania Human Rights in Post-communist Albania], March 1, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the general elections of June 1996 the Democratic Party tried to win an absolute majority and manipulated the results.&lt;ref&gt;Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, [http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/albania/13567 Parliamentary Elections 26 May and 2 June: Observations], July 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1997 rebellion in Albania|The government fell in 1997]] after the collapse of a number of large "[[pyramid scheme]]s" (more accurately, [[Ponzi scheme]]s) and widespread [[corruption in Albania|corruption]], which caused disorder and rebellion throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Albania in Crisis: The Predictable Fall of the Shining Star|last = Vaughan-Whitehead|first = Daniel|publisher = Edward Elgar Pub|year = 1999|isbn = 1840640707|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government attempted to suppress the revolt by force but the attempt failed, due to low morale and corruption in the [[military of Albania|armed forces]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the help of international mediation led by OSCE special envoy [[Franz Vranitzky]], the ruling and opposition parties agreed to form a Reconciliation Government and to hold new elections.

[http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/14029 Elections in June 1997] brought the opposition Socialist Party (former communist party) to power, and it ruled under various prime ministers until 2005. The Democratic Party won parliamentary elections in 2005 and 2009, and Albania was governed again by Sali Berisha, this time as prime minister. The Socialist Party won the elections in 2013, and is governed by its party head and Prime Minister [[Edi Rama]].

According to the constitution, approved by referendum on November 22, 1998, promulgated on November 28, 1998, and amended in January 2007, Albania has a democratic system of government with separation of powers and protection of fundamental human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/albania/41888 Constitution of the Republic of Albania].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of communism, the country became more aligned towards the [[Western world|West]] than its, albeit unenthused, relations with [[Russia]] or [[China]]. Albania joined [[NATO]] in 2009 and is aiming to join the [[European Union]] in the [[Accession of Albania to the European Union|future]].

'''French Polynesia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-French Polynesia.ogg|ˈ|f|r|ɛ|n|tʃ|_|p|ɒ|l|ᵻ|ˈ|n|iː|ʒ|ə}}; {{lang-fr|Polynésie française}} {{IPA-fr|pɔlinezi fʁɑ̃sɛːz|}}; {{lang-ty|Pōrīnetia Farāni}}) is an [[overseas collectivity]] of the [[French Republic]] and the only [[overseas country of France]]. It is composed of 118 geographically dispersed islands and [[atoll]]s stretching over an expanse of more than {{convert|2000|km|mi}} in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific Ocean]]. Its total land area is {{convert|4167|km2|sqmi}}.

French Polynesia is divided into five groups of islands: the [[Society Islands]] archipelago, composed of the [[Windward Islands (Society Islands)|Windward Islands]] and the [[Leeward Islands (Society Islands)|Leeward Islands]]; the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Archipelago]]; the [[Gambier Islands]]; the [[Marquesas Islands]]; and the [[Austral Islands]]. Among its 118 islands and atolls, 67 are inhabited. [[Tahiti]], which is located within the Society Islands, is the most populous island, having close to 69% of the population of French Polynesia {{As of|2017|lc=y}}. [[Papeete]], located on Tahiti, is the capital. Although not an integral part of its territory, [[Clipperton Island]] was administered from French Polynesia until 2007.

Following the [[Polynesia#History of the Polynesian people|Great Polynesian Migration]], European explorers visited the islands of French Polynesia on several occasions. Traders and whaling ships also visited. In 1842, the French took over the islands and established a French [[protectorate]] they called ''{{lang|fr|Etablissements des français en Océanie (EFO)}}'' (French Establishments/Settlements in Oceania).

In 1946, the ''{{lang|fr|EFOs}}'' became an [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] under the constitution of the [[French Fourth Republic]], and Polynesians were granted the right to vote through citizenship. In 1957, the ''{{lang|fr|EFOs}}'' were renamed French Polynesia. Since 28 March 2003, French Polynesia has been an overseas collectivity of the French Republic under the constitutional revision of article 74, and later gained, with law 2004-192 of 27 February 2004, an administrative autonomy, two symbolic manifestations of which are the title of the [[President of French Polynesia]] and its additional designation as an overseas country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectivites-locales.gouv.fr/statuts-nouvelle-caledonie-et-polynesie#statut_pol_fcse|title=Les statuts de la Nouvelle-Calédonie et de la Polynésie|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French Polynesia was one of the last places on Earth to be settled by humans. Scientists believe the Great Polynesian Migration happened around 1500 BC as [[Austronesian]] people went on a journey using celestial navigation to find islands in the South Pacific Ocean. The first islands of French Polynesia to be settled were the Marquesas Islands in about 200 BC. The Polynesians later ventured southwest and discovered the Society Islands around AD 300.&lt;ref name=KMLA1797&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/pacific/frpolynpre1797.html|title=History of Polynesia, before 1797|first=Alexander|last=Ganse|accessdate=20 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230062227/http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/pacific/frpolynpre1797.html|archivedate=30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European encounters began in 1521 when Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]], sailing at the service of the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]], sighted [[Puka-Puka]] in the [[Îles Tuamotu-Gambier|Tuāmotu-Gambier Archipelago]]. In 1606 another Spanish expedition under [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] sailed through Polynesia sighting an inhabited island on 10 February&lt;ref&gt;James Burney (1803) ''A Chronological History of the Voyages or Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean'', Vol. 5, London, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; which they called Sagitaria (or Sagittaria), probably the island of [[Rekareka]] to the southeast of Tahiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Geo.

Over a century later, British explorer [[Samuel Wallis]] visited Tahiti in 1767. French explorer [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] also visited Tahiti in 1768, while British explorer [[James Cook]] arrived in 1769.&lt;ref name="KMLA1797"/&gt;  In 1772, the Spanish [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Viceroy of Peru]] Don [[Manuel de Amat y Junient|Manuel de Amat]] ordered a number of expeditions to Tahiti under the command of [[Domingo de Bonechea]] who was the first European to explore all of the main islands beyond Tahiti.&lt;ref name="Paradise Past book (page 43: The De Boenechea Expedition)"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klglH_7KkxsC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=manuel+de+amat+tahiti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D__pDUnHpY&amp;sig=yW9d0c9CQiF4LzLjDaoymBrOgzs&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q8eGUa3nHdPb7AbdqIHABQ&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=manuel%20de%20amat%20tahiti&amp;f=false|title=Paradise Past: The Transformation of the South Pacific, 1520–1920|first=Robert K.|last=Kirk|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short-lived Spanish settlement was created in 1774,&lt;ref name=KMLA1797/&gt; and for a time some maps bore the name ''Isla de Amat'' after Viceroy Amat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Manso Porto |first=Carmen |authorlink= |year=1997 |title=Cartografía histórica de América: catálogo de manuscritos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t3q5d62Q4sAC&amp;pg=PA10 |location=Madrid |publisher=Real Academia de la Historia |language=Spanish |page=10 |isbn=9788489512023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772, Dutchman [[Jakob Roggeveen]] came across [[Bora Bora]] in the Society Islands. [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missions]] began with Spanish priests who stayed in Tahiti for a year. Protestants from the [[London Missionary Society]] settled permanently in Polynesia in 1797.

[[File:Society kingdoms.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Society Island kingdoms.]]

King [[Pomare II|Pōmare II]] of Tahiti was forced to flee to [[Moorea|Mo'orea]] in 1803; he and his subjects were converted to Protestantism in 1812. French Catholic missionaries arrived on Tahiti in 1834; their expulsion in 1836 caused France to send a gunboat in 1838. In 1842, Tahiti and [[Tahuata]] were declared a [[protectorate|French protectorate]], to allow Catholic missionaries to work undisturbed. The capital of [[Papeete|Papeetē]] was founded in 1843. In 1880, France annexed Tahiti, changing the status from that of a protectorate to that of a [[French colonial empires|colony]]. The island groups were not officially united until the establishment of the French protectorate in 1889.&lt;ref name=KMLA1889&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/pacific/frpolyn17971889.html|title=History of French Polynesia, 1797 to 1889|first=Alexander|last=Ganse|accessdate=20 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230062212/http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/pacific/frpolyn17971889.html|archivedate=30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After France declared a protectorate over Tahiti in 1840, the British and French signed the ''{{ill|Jarnac Convention|fr|Convention de Jarnac}}'', in 1847, declaring that the kingdoms of [[Raiatea]], [[Huahine]] and Bora Bora were to remain independent from either powers and that no single chief was to be allowed to reign over the entire archipelago. France eventually broke the agreement, and the islands were annexed and became a colony in 1888 (eight years after the Windward Islands) after many native resistances and conflicts called the Leewards War, lasting until 1897.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;{{cite book |author= Robert D.

In the 1880s, France claimed the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]], which formerly belonged to the [[Pomare Dynasty|Pōmare Dynasty]], without formally annexing it. Having declared a protectorate over Tahuata in 1842, the French regarded the entire Marquesas Islands as French. In 1885, France appointed a governor and established a general council, thus giving it the proper administration for a colony. The islands of [[Rimatara]] and [[Rurutu|Rūrutu]] unsuccessfully lobbied for British protection in 1888, so in 1889 they were annexed by France. Postage stamps were first issued in the colony in 1892. The first official name for the colony was ''Établissements de l'Océanie'' (Establishments in Oceania); in 1903 the general council was changed to an advisory council and the colony's name was changed to ''Établissements Français de l'Océanie'' (French Establishments in Oceania).&lt;ref name=KMLA1918&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/pacific/frpolyn18891918.html|title=History of French Polynesia, 1889 to 1918|first=Alexander|last=Ganse|accessdate=20 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230062217/http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/pacific/frpolyn18891918.html|archivedate=30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the administration of French Polynesia recognised the [[Free French Forces]] and many Polynesians served in World War II. Unknown at the time to the French and Polynesians, the [[Fumimaro Konoe|Konoe]] Cabinet in [[Imperial Japan]] on 16 September 1940 included French Polynesia among the many territories which were to become [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere#Japanese-governed|Japanese possessions]], as part of the "Eastern Pacific Government-General" in [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|the post-war world]].&lt;ref&gt;The Japanese claim to the French Pacific islands, along with many other vast territories, appears in 16 September 1940 "Sphere of survival for the Establishment of a New Order in Greater East Asia by Imperial Japan", published in 1955 by Japan's Foreign Ministry as part of the two-volume "Chronology and major documents of Diplomacy of Japan 1840–1945" – here quoted from "Interview with Tetsuzo Fuwa: Japan's War: History of Expansionism", Japan Press Service, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the course of the war in the Pacific the Japanese were not able to launch an actual invasion of the French islands.

In 1946, Polynesians were granted French citizenship and the islands' status was changed to an overseas territory; the islands' name was changed in 1957 to ''Polynésie Française'' (French Polynesia). In 1962, France's early [[France and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear testing]] ground of [[Algeria]] became independent and the [[Moruroa|Moruroa atoll]] in the Tuamotu Archipelago was selected as the new testing site; tests were conducted underground after 1974.&lt;ref name=KMLA1977&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/pacific/frpolyn193977.html|title=History of Polynesia, 1939 to 1977|first=Alexander|last=Ganse|accessdate=20 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230062222/http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/pacific/frpolyn193977.html|archivedate=30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, French Polynesia was granted partial internal autonomy; in 1984, the autonomy was extended. French Polynesia became a full overseas collectivity of France in 2003.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|fp|French Polynesia}}. Retrieved 25 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1995, France stirred up widespread protests by resuming nuclear testing at [[Fangataufa]] atoll after a three-year moratorium. The last test was on 27 January 1996. On 29 January 1996, France announced that it would accede to the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]], and no longer test nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times |title=France Ending Nuclear Tests That Caused Broad Protests|first=Craig R|last=Whitney|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D71639F933A05752C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|date=30 January 1996|accessdate=20 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French Polynesia was relisted in the UN List of Non-Self Governing Territories in 2013, making it eligible for a UN-backed independence referendum. The relisting was made after its indigenous government was voiced and supported by the Polynesian Leaders Group, Pacific Conference of Churches, Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, Non-Aligned Movement, World Council of Churches, and Melanesian Spearhead Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/10/french-polynesia-last-vestiges-of-frances-empire/2/|title=French Polynesia Battles for Independence|work=[[The Diplomat]]|date=10 October 2012|first=Rachel|last=Reeves|first2=Luke|last2=Hunt|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
{{main|Politics of French Polynesia}}
Under the terms of Article 74 of the [[Constitution of France|French constitution]] and the [[Organic Law]] 2014-192 on the statute of autonomy of French Polynesia, politics of French Polynesia takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] French overseas collectivity, whereby the President of French Polynesia is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Assembly of French Polynesia]] (the territorial assembly).

Political life in French Polynesia has been marked by great instability since the mid-2000s. On 14 September 2007, the pro-independence leader [[Oscar Temaru]], was elected president of French Polynesia for the third time in three years (with 27 of 44 votes cast in the territorial assembly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6994513.stm |title=BBC NEWS, French Polynesia gets new leader |publisher=BBC News  |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced former president [[Gaston Tong Sang]], opposed to independence, who lost a [[no-confidence vote]] in the Assembly of French Polynesia on 31 August after the longtime former president of French Polynesia, [[Gaston Flosse]], hitherto opposed to independence, sided with his long enemy Oscar Temaru to topple the government of Gaston Tong Sang. Oscar Temaru, however, had no stable majority in the Assembly of French Polynesia, and new territorial elections were held in February 2008 to solve the political crisis.

[[File:Assemblée de Polynésie.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Assembly of French Polynesia]].]]
The party of Gaston Tong Sang won the territorial elections, but that did not solve the political crisis: the two minority parties of Oscar Temaru and Gaston Flosse, who together have one more member in the territorial assembly than the political party of Gaston Tong Sang, allied to prevent Gaston Tong Sang from becoming president of French Polynesia. Gaston Flosse was then elected president of French Polynesia by the territorial assembly on 23 February 2008 with the support of the pro-independence party led by Oscar Temaru, while Oscar Temaru was elected speaker of the territorial assembly with the support of the anti-independence party led by Gaston Flosse. Both formed a coalition cabinet. Many observers doubted that the alliance between the anti-independence Gaston Flosse and the pro-independence Oscar Temaru, designed to prevent Gaston Tong Sang from becoming president of French Polynesia, could last very long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfo.fr/article1437.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304152635/http://www.rfo.fr/article1437.html |archivedate=4 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[French municipal elections, 2008|French municipal elections held in March 2008]], several prominent mayors who are member of the Flosse-Temaru coalition lost their offices in key municipalities of French Polynesia, which was interpreted as a disapproval of the way Gaston Tong Sang, whose party French Polynesian voters had placed first in the territorial elections the month before, had been prevented from becoming president of French Polynesia by the last minute alliance between Flosse and Temaru's parties. Eventually, on 15 April 2008 the government of Gaston Flosse was toppled by a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] in the territorial assembly when two members of the Flosse-Temaru coalition left the coalition and sided with Tong Sang's party. Gaston Tong Sang was elected president of French Polynesia as a result of this constructive vote of no confidence, but his majority in the territorial assembly is very narrow. He offered posts in his cabinet to Flosse and Temaru's parties which they both refused. Gaston Tong Sang has called all parties to help end the instability in local politics, a prerequisite to attract foreign investors needed to develop the local economy.

=== Administration ===
[[File:Bora Bora, French Polynesia.jpg|thumb|[[Bora Bora]]]]
Between 1946 and 2003, French Polynesia had the status of an overseas territory (''{{lang|fr|[[territoire d'outre-mer]]}}'', or ''TOM''). In 2003, it became an overseas collectivity (''{{lang|fr|[[collectivité d'outre-mer]]}}'', or COM). Its statutory law of 27 February 2004 gives it the particular designation of ''[[overseas country of France|overseas country inside the Republic]]'' (''{{lang|fr|pays d'outre-mer au sein de la République}}'', or POM), but without legal modification of its status.

=== Relations with mainland France ===
[[File:Haut Commissariat à Papeete.JPG|thumb|High Commission of the [[French Fifth Republic]].]]
Despite a local assembly and government, French Polynesia is not in a [[Associated state|free association]] with France, like the [[Cook Islands]] with [[New Zealand]]. As a French overseas collectivity, the local government has no competence in justice, university education, security and defense. Services in these areas are directly provided and administered by the Government of France, including the [[National Gendarmerie]] (which also polices rural and border areas in European France), and [[French Armed Forces|French military forces]]. The collectivity government retains control over primary and secondary education, health, town planning, and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/10/french-polynesia-last-vestiges-of-frances-empire/|title=French Polynesia Battles for Independence|author1=Rachel Reeves |author2=Luke Hunt |author3=The Diplomat |work=The Diplomat|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest representative of the State in the territory is the [[High Commissioner of the Republic in French Polynesia]] ({{lang-fr|Haut commissaire de la République}}).

French Polynesia also sends three [[Member of Parliament|deputies]] to the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]], one representing the [[Leeward Islands (Society Islands)|Leeward Islands]] [[Administrative divisions of French Polynesia|administrative subdivision]] and the south-western suburbs of Papeete, another one representing Papeete and its north-eastern suburbs, plus the [[Communes of France|commune]] (municipality) of [[Moorea-Maiao|Mo'orea-Mai'ao]], the [[Îles Tuamotu-Gambier|Tuāmotu-Gambier]] administrative division, and the Marquesas Islands administrative division, and the last one representing the rest of Tahiti and the Austral Islands administrative subdivision. French Polynesia also sends two senators to the [[Senate of France|French Senate]].

French Polynesians vote in the French presidential elections and at the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 French presidential election]], in which the pro-independence leader Oscar Temaru openly called to vote for the Socialist candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] while the parties opposed to independence generally supported the center-right candidate [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the [[Voter turnout|turnout]] in French Polynesia was 69.12% in the first round of the election and 74.67% in the second round in favour of Nicolas Sarkozy ahead in both rounds of the election expressing their will to remain in the French Republic. (versus in Metropolitan France in the 2nd round: Nicolas Sarkozy 51.9%; Ségolène Royal 48.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/000/987/987.html| title=POLYNESIE FRANCAISE (987) (résultats officiels) | first=[[Cabinet of France|Government of France]]| last=[[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]]|accessdate=14 September 2007|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:French Polynesia relief map.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|right|Map of French Polynesia.]]
{{main|Geography of French Polynesia}}

The islands of French Polynesia make up a total land area of {{convert|3521|km2|sqmi}},&lt;ref name=area /&gt; scattered over more than {{convert|2000|km|mi}} of ocean. There are 118 islands in French Polynesia (and many more islets or ''motus'' around [[atoll]]s). The highest point is [[Mount Orohena]] on Tahiti.

It is made up of six archipelagos. The largest and most populated island is Tahiti, in the Society Islands.

The archipelagos are :
* [[Marquesas Islands]] – administratively making the Marquesas Islands subdivision (12 high islands and 1 atoll);
* [[Society Islands]] – administratively subdivided into the Windward Islands subdivision (5 high islands) and the Leeward Islands District (5 atolls);
* [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Archipelago]] – administratively part of the Tuamotu-Gambier subdivision (80 atolls, grouping over 3,100 islands or islets);
* [[Gambier Islands]] – administratively part of the Tuamotu-Gambier subdivision (2 atolls in genesis);
* [[Austral Islands]] – administratively part of the Austral Islands subdivision : (5 atolls);
* [[Bass Islands (French Polynesia)|Bass Islands]] – administratively part of the Austral Islands subdivision (2 atolls).

Aside from Tahiti, some other important atolls, islands, and island groups in French Polynesia are: [[Ahe|Ahē]], [[Bora Bora]], [[Hiva Oa|Hiva 'Oa]], [[Huahine]], [[Maiao|Mai'ao]], [[Maupiti]], [[Mehetia|Meheti'a]], [[Mo'orea]], [[Nuku Hiva]], [[Raiatea]], [[Tahaa|Taha'a]], [[Tetiaroa]], [[Tubuai (Austral Islands)|Tupua'i]], and [[Tupai|Tūpai]].

At the 1988 census, the last census which asked questions regarding ethnicity, 66.5% of people were ethnically unmixed [[Polynesia#Cultures of Polynesia|Polynesians]], 7.1% were ethnically Polynesians with light European and/or East Asian mixing, 11.9% were [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] (mostly [[French people|French]]), 9.3% were people of mixed European and Polynesian descent, the so-called Demis (literally meaning "Half"), and 4.7% were [[East Asians]] (mainly [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]]).&lt;ref name=ethnicities /&gt;

Chinese, Demis, and the white populace are essentially concentrated on the island of Tahiti, particularly in the urban area of Papeete, where their share of the population is thus much greater than in French Polynesia overall.&lt;ref name=ethnicities /&gt; Despite a long history of ethnic mixing, ethnic tensions have been growing in recent years, with politicians using a [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] discourse and fanning the flame of nationalism.&lt;ref name=logiques&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conflits.org/index1709.html |title=Logiques " autonomiste " et " indépendantiste " en Polynésie française |publisher=Conflits.org |accessdate=31 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124044158/http://www.conflits.org/index1709.html |archive-date=24 January 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rue89.com/2008/03/01/temaru-flosse-le-rebond-du-nationalisme-tahitien |title=Temaru-Flosse: le rebond du nationalisme tahitien |publisher=Rue89.com |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{main|Music of French Polynesia}}

French Polynesia came to the forefront of the [[world music]] scene in 1992,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} with the release of [[The Tahitian Choir]]'s recordings of unaccompanied vocal Christian music called [[himene tārava]], recorded by French musicologist [[Pascal Nabet-Meyer]]. This form of singing is common in French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, and is distinguished by a unique drop in pitch at the end of the phrases, which is a characteristic formed by several different voices; it is also accompanied by steady grunting of staccato, nonsensical syllables.

=== Religion ===
[[Christianity]] is the main religion of the islands. A majority of 54% belongs to various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, especially the [[Maohi Protestant Church]], which is the largest and accounts for more than 50% of the population.&lt;ref name=tahitipresse&gt;{{cite news |title=126th Maohi Protestant Church Synod to last one week |url=http://en.tahitipresse.pf/2010/07/126th-maohi-protestant-church-synod-to-last-one-week/ |work=[[Tahitipresse]] |publisher= |date=26 July 2010 |accessdate=31 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64LUkdnR5?url=http://en.tahitipresse.pf/2010/07/126th-maohi-protestant-church-synod-to-last-one-week/ |archivedate=31 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It traces its origins to [[Pomare II]], the king of Tahiti, who converted from traditional beliefs to the [[Reformed tradition]] brought to the islands by the [[London Missionary Society]].

Latin rite [[Roman Catholics]] constitute a large minority with 30% of the population, which has its own [[ecclesiastical province]], comprising the Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Papeete]] and its only suffragan, the [[Diocese of Taiohae]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/country/PF.htm GCatholic consulted April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in French Polynesia|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] had 25,841 members {{As of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/french-polynesia/ LDS Newsroom Statistical Information].

Community of Christ. 2016. pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Mareva Arnaud Tchong]] who serves in the church's governing [[Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)|Council of Twelve Apostles]].

== Economy and infrastructure ==
{{main|Economy of French Polynesia}}
[[File:DSC00033 Polynésia Moréa island Haapiti Beach (8076090305).jpg|thumb|right|Tourism is an important source of income for French Polynesia]]
The legal tender of French Polynesia is the [[CFP Franc]] which has a fixed exchange rate with the [[Euro]]. The nominal [[gross domestic product]] (or GDP) of French Polynesia in 2014 was 5.623&amp;nbsp;billion [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] at market local prices, the sixth-largest economy in Oceania after [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Hawaii]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=GDP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=FRENCH%20POLYNESIA#Economic|title=French Polynesia|work=United Nations|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GDP per capita was $20,098 in 2014 (at market exchange rates, not at [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]), lower than in [[Hawaii]], [[Australia]], New Zealand, and [[New Caledonia]], but higher than all the independent insular states of [[Oceania]]. Both per capita and total figures were significantly lower than those recorded before the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref name=GDP /&gt;

French Polynesia has a moderately developed economy, which is dependent on imported goods, tourism, and the financial assistance of mainland France. Tourist facilities are well developed and are available on the major islands. Main agricultural productions are [[coconut]]s ([[copra]]), vegetables and fruits. French Polynesia exports [[noni]] juice, a high quality [[Vanilla production in French Polynesia|vanilla]], and the famous [[Tahitian pearl|black Tahitian pearls]] which accounted for 55% of exports (in value) in 2008.&lt;ref name=FT /&gt;

French Polynesia's seafloor contains rich deposits of [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], [[manganese]], and [[Copper extraction|copper]] that are not exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manheim|first1=F. T.|title=Marine Cobalt Resources|journal=Science|volume=232|issue=4750|year=1986|pages=600–608|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.232.4750.600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, French Polynesia's imports amounted to 2.2&amp;nbsp;billion U.S. dollars and exports amounted to 0.2&amp;nbsp;billion U.S. dollars.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ieom.fr/upload/RA2008_PF.pdf|format=PDF| title=La Polynésie française en 2008| author=[[Institut d'émission d'Outre-Mer]] (IEOM)|accessdate=14 September 2009|language=fr}} {{cbignore}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transportation ===
{{main|Transportation in French Polynesia}}

There are 53 airports in French Polynesia; 46 are paved.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; [[Fa'a'ā International Airport]] is the only international airport in French Polynesia. Each island has its own airport that serves flights to other islands. [[Air Tahiti]] is the main airline that flies around the islands.

=== Communication ===
In 2017, Alcatel Submarine Networks, a unit of [[Nokia]], launched a massive project to connect many of the islands in French Polynesia with underwater fiber optic cable. The project, called NATITUA will improve French Polynesian broadband connectivity by linking Tahiti to 10 islands in the Tuamotu and Marquesas archipelagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lightwaveonline.com/articles/2017/07/natitua-submarine-cable-system-to-bridge-french-polynesian-digital-divide.html|title=NATITUA submarine cable system to bridge French Polynesian digital divide|website=lightwaveonline.com|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, a celebration was held to commemorate the arrival of a submarine cable from [[Papeete]] to the atoll of Hao, extending the network by about 1000 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/363491/submarine-cable-extended-to-french-polynesia-s-hao|title=Submarine cable extended to French Polynesia's Hao|date=2018-08-07|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Fédération nationale des Jaunes de France''''' (in [[English language|English]], the "'''National Federation of the Yellows of France'''") was the first 'yellow' or [[company union]] in France. It was created by [[Pierre Biétry]] in 1902. The [[yellow]] colour was deliberately chosen in opposition to the [[red]] colour associated with [[socialism]].

==Work==
Jones initially researched relationships between business and governments. He published historical monographs on the oil industry&lt;ref name="Jones1981"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=The State and the Emergence of the British Oil Industry|year=1981|publisher=MacMillan Press|isbn=0-333-27595-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international banking.&lt;ref name="JonesJones1986"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=Banking and Empire in Iran|year=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-32322-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1980s, Jones, alongside [[Mark Casson]], was also involved in calling for a more theoretical approach to business history, particularly in the use of [[economic theory]].&lt;ref name="JonesZeitlin2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|author2=Jonathan Zeitlin|title=The Oxford Handbook of Business History|year=2008|publisher=Oxford Handbooks Online|isbn=978-0-19-926368-4|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he wrote historical studies of industries over long time periods, including ''British Multinational Banking 1830-1990'' (Oxford, 1993)&lt;ref name="Jones1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=British Multinational Banking|year=1993|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0-19-820602-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Merchants to Multinationals'' (Oxford, 2000).&lt;ref name="JonesJones2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=Merchants to Multinationals|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-924999-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Merchants to Multinationals'' was awarded the Newcomen-Harvard Prize for the best business history book published in the United States between 1998 and 2000, and the Wadsworth Prize for the best work of business history published in Britain in 2000. After moving to Harvard Business School, Jones published books on the history of global business, including ''Multinationals and Global Capitalism'' (Oxford, 2005).&lt;ref name="Jones2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=Multinationals and Global Capitalism|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-927210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Jones published ''Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry'' (Oxford, 2010).&lt;ref name=Jones2010&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|author2=Bee Wilson|title=Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2010|isbn=978-0199556496}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, and elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/experts/geoffjones |title=Geoff Jones |publisher=Big Think |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones has sought both to explain the growth of the beauty industry and to explore its impact over the last century on homogenizing beauty ideals worldwide. Recently Jones has focused on the history of green business and [[sustainability]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zkYeuVoo1M |title=The Importance of Green Business, AIB Conference, Nagoya, 2011 |via=YouTube |date=15 February 2013 |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has written on the societal responsibilities of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/14-004_2fbc7e4e-09a2-4c52-9b15-910b43fa0d5b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Creating Emerging Markets project, he has also researched the business history of emerging markets, especially Latin America&lt;ref name="JonesLluch2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|author2=Andrea Lluch|title=The Impact of Globalization on Argentina and Chile.

In 2006 he and [[Tarun Khanna]] published a widely cited article in the [[Journal of International Business Studies]], the premier international business journal, on this issue.&lt;ref name="JonesKhanna2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Geoffrey Jones|author2=Tarun Khanna|year= 2006|title=Bringing History (back) to International Business|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|volume=37|issue=4|pages=453–468|doi=10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400198}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently Jones and Khanna have published on the importance of corporate reputation in emerging markets, employing data from the Creating Emerging Markets project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Harvard Business School|title=Overcoming institutional voids to succeed in emerging markets|date=6 March 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWq2eSXgdC0|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones has warned of the risks to the world economy of economic nationalism and [[populism]].&lt;ref name="Brexitisjustthelatestblowtoglobalization"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belsie|first1=Lauren|title=Brexit is just the latest blow to globalization|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2016/0627/Brexit-is-just-the-latest-blow-to-globalization|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Jones suggested the world economy was undergoing a process of de-globalization.&lt;ref name="mintweareinadeglobalization"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Agarwal|first1=Sapna|last2=Raje|first2=Aparna Piramal|title=We are in a deglobalization period: Business historian Geoffrey G.

Later KH-11 satellites have been referred to by outside observers as KH-11B or KH-12, and by the names "Advanced KENNEN", "Improved Crystal" and "Ikon". Official budget documents refer to the latest generation of Electro-Optical satellites as ''Evolved Enhanced CRYSTAL System''.&lt;ref name="FY2013NIP"/&gt; The [[Key Hole]] series was officially discontinued in favor of a random numbering scheme after repeated public references to [[KH-7 Gambit]], [[KH-8 Gambit]]-3, [[KH-9 Hexagon]], and KH-11 satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America's Secret Eyes in Space: The U.S. Keyhole Spy Satellite Program|author=Jeffrey T.

== Program history and logistics==
The Film Read-Out [[Gambit (satellite)|GAMBIT]] (FROG) served as NRO Program A's competitor to NRO Program B's initial electro-optical imagery (EOI) satellite.&lt;ref&gt;National Reconnaissance Office. GAMBIT and HEXAGON Programmatic Declassification Guidance. 23 June 2011. Released by NRO on 7 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; After a precursor EOI study with the codeword Zoster, NRO Program B developed an EOI satellite under the initial codeword Zaman, which was replaced by the codeword Kennen in Nov 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Reconnaissance Office Review and Redaction Guide: Version 1.0 2015 Edition|date=2017-06-20|publisher=NRO|url=http://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/ForAll/101917/F-2017-00008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KENNEN Memo: Birth of a BYEMAN Codeword|date=1971-11-24|publisher=NRO|url=http://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/ForAll/033017/F-2017-00026.pdf|author=Frederick L. Hofmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data is transmitted through a network of [[communications satellite]]s; the [[Satellite Data System]].&lt;ref name="Richelson"/&gt;
The initial ground station for the processing of the electro-optical imaging was a secret National Reconnaissance Office facility in [[Area 58]], located in the continental United States according to the NRO,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRO review and redaction guide (2006 ed.)| url=https://fas.org/irp/nro/declass.pdf |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and more precisely in [[Fort Belvoir]] according to other sources.&lt;ref name="associatepublishers_quasar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quasar (satellite)|url=http://www.associatepublisher.com/e/q/qu/quasar_(satellite).htm|publisher=associatepublisher.com|date=12 March 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, NRO selected [[Boeing]] as the prime contractor for the [[Future Imagery Architecture]] (FIA) program, aimed at replacing the KH-11 satellites by a more cost effective constellation of smaller, and also more capable reconnaissance satellites. After the failure of the FIA in 2005, NRO ordered from Lockheed two additional legacy hardware KH-11s.&lt;ref name="DN20090602"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20090602/C4ISR02/906020302/Spy-sat-rescue|title=Spy-sat rescue: Obama's proposal to prevent a gap in coverage sparks debate, optimism|publisher=Defense News|first=Ben|last=Iannotta|date=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[USA-224]], the first of these two, was launched in early 2011 two years ahead of the initial schedule estimate.&lt;ref name="NRO20110907"&gt;{{cite web| title=10 Who Made a Difference in Space: Bruce Carlson, NRO Director| date=7 September 2011| publisher=Space News / NRO| url=http://www.nro.gov/news/articles/2011/2011-01.pdf| access-date=8 September 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929040832/http://www.nro.gov/news/articles/2011/2011-01.pdf| archive-date=29 September 2011| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 [[2012 National Reconnaissance Office space telescope donation to NASA|NRO offered NASA two space optical systems]] with 2.4 m diameter primary mirrors, similar to the Hubble Space Telescope, yet with steerable secondary mirrors and shorter focal length resulting in a wider field of view.  These could either be spare hardware from the KH-11 program, or optics from the cancelled FIA program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47743440/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/donated-space-telescopes-are-leftover-spy-program-failures |title=Donated space telescopes are leftover spy program failures |publisher=MSNBC |author=Warren Ferster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= NRO donates spare telescopes to NASA|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/nro-donates-spare-telescopes-to-nasa-372916/ |publisher=FlightGlobal |author= Zach Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The satellites were reportedly stored in a clean room facility at [[ITT Exelis]] in Rochester, NY.&lt;ref name="WP20120604"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nasa-gets-military-spy-telescopes-for-astronomy/2012/06/04/gJQAsT6UDV_story.html?hpid=z3|title=NASA gets two military spy telescopes for astronomy|publisher=Washington Post|first=Joel|last=Achenbach|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20120604"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/science/space/repurposed-telescope-may-explore-secrets-of-dark-energy.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Former Spy Telescope May Explore Secrets of Dark Energy|publisher=New York Times|first=Dennis|last=Overbye|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size and mass===
KH-11s are believed to resemble the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in size and shape, as the [[satellite]]s were shipped in similar containers. 
Their length is believed to be 19.5 meters, with a diameter of up to 3 meters.&lt;ref name="Richelson"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite web| author=Mark Wade| date=9 August 2003| url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/kh11.htm| title=KH-11| publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica| accessdate=23 April 2004| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68ZS4Q10o?url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/kh11.htm| archivedate=20 June 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[NASA]] history of the Hubble,&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/book/ The Power to Explore], NASA. In particular, [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/book/chpttwelve.pdf Chapter XII – The Hubble Space Telescope] Chapter 12, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; in discussing the reasons for switching from a 3-meter main mirror to a 2.4-meter design, states: "In addition, changing to a 2.4-meter mirror would lessen fabrication costs by using manufacturing technologies developed for military spy satellites." 

Different versions of the KH-11 vary in mass. Early KH-11s were reported to be comparable in mass to the [[KH-9 Hexagon]]&lt;ref name=NYTimes19850113&gt;{{cite web| first=James|last=Bamford| date=13 January 1985 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/magazine/america-s-supersecret-eyes-in-space.html| title=America's super secret eyes in space| publisher=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;, i.e. about 12,000 kg. Later blocks are believed to have a mass of around 19,600&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="Richelson"/&gt; 

===Propulsion module===

It has been reported that KH-11s are equipped with a [[Hydrazine]] powered propulsion system for orbital adjustments. In order to increase the orbital lifetime of KH-11s, plans existed for refuelling the propulsion module during service visits by the [[Space Shuttle]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes19850113/&gt; It has been speculated that the propulsion module is related to Lockheed's [[Satellite Support Bus]] (SSB), which had been derived from the [[KH-9_Hexagon#Development|Satellite Control Section]] (SCS) developed by Lockheed for KH-9.&lt;ref name=TheSpaceReview20110207&gt;{{cite web| first=Dwayne A.|last=Day| date=7 February 2011 |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1774/2| title=The flight of the Big Bird (part 2)| publisher=The Space Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optical Telescope Assembly===

A [[CIA]] history states that the primary mirror on the first KH-11s measured 2.34 meters, but sizes increased in later versions.&lt;ref name="Richelson"/&gt; NRO led the development of a computer controlled mirror polishing technique, which was subsequently also used for the polishing of the primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope.&lt;ref name=GJTenet20000927&gt;{{cite web| first=George J.|last=Tenet| date=27 September 2000 |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2000/dci_speech_09272000_gala.html| title=DCI Remarks at the NRO 40th Anniversary Gala| publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later satellites had larger mirrors, with a diameter of around 2.9–3.1 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/kh-12.htm|title=KH-12 Improved Crystal|author=Charles P. Vick| publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|date=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jane's Defence Weekly]]'' indicates that the secondary mirror in the [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] [[reflecting telescope]] system could be moved, allowing images to be taken from angles unusual for a satellite. Also, there are indications that the satellite can take images every five seconds.

===Imaging sensors===

KH-11 Block II might have been the first reconnaissance satellite equipped for imaging with a {{nowrap|800 x 800 pixels}} [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/kh-11.htm globalsecurity.org – KH-11 KENNAN], 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Later block satellites may include [[signals intelligence]] capabilities and greater sensitivity in broader [[electromagnetic spectrum|light spectrum]]s (probably into [[infrared]]).&lt;ref name="CBOPublication528"&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. Costs of Verification and Compliance Under Pending Arms Treaties (CBO Publication #528) |year=September 1990 |publisher= CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES | url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/77xx/doc7775/90-CBO-043.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications===

Communication to and data downloads from KH-11 satellites are routed through a constellation of communication relay satellites in higher orbits. The initial communications relay payload is believed to have operated at a frequency of 60 GHz, as radio emission at this frequency is blocked by Earth's atmosphere, and thus not detectable from the ground. Launch of the initial two [[Satellite Data System|Satellite Data System satellites]] occurred in June and August 1976, i.e. ahead of the first launch of a KH-11 satellite in late 1976.&lt;ref name=TheSpaceReview20180267&gt;{{cite web| first=Dwayne A.|last=Day| date=26 February 2018 |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3440/1| title=Shadow dancing: the Satellite Data System| publisher=The Space Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolution and ground sample distance===

A perfect 2.4-meter [[mirror]] observing in the visual (i.e. at a wavelength of 500 nm) has a [[Angular_resolution#Single_telescope|diffraction limited resolution]] of around 0.05 arcsec, which from an orbital altitude of 250 km corresponds to a [[ground sample distance]] of 0.06 m (6 cm, 2.4 inches). [[Astronomical seeing|Operational resolution]] should be worse due to effects of the [[Fried parameter|atmospheric   turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fried|first=D. L.|title=Optical Resolution Through a Randomly Inhomogeneous Medium for Very Long and Very Short Exposures|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|date=October 1966|volume=56|issue=10|pages=1372–1379|doi=10.1364/JOSA.56.001372|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?id=53167|bibcode=1966JOSA...56.1372F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Clifford Stoll]] estimates that such a telescope could resolve up to "a couple inches. Not quite good enough to recognize a face".&lt;ref name="stoll1989"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cuckoo's Egg | publisher=Doubleday | author=Stoll, Clifford | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-307-81942-0 | authorlink=Clifford Stoll | pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When NRO donated  two Optical Telescope Assemblies (OTA) to NASA in January 2011, they were suspected to be KH-11 series "extra hardware", but were later attributed to the [[Future Imaging Architecture]] program. The donated OTAs feature a [[three-mirror anastigmat]] (TMA) optical design, without the tertiary mirror. The f/1.2 primary has a diameter of 2.4 m, and is refocused by the secondary to give an overall f/8 focal ratio, making the optical telescope assembly shorter than that of HST.  With the addition of the tertiary mirror, this will produce a much wider field than Hubble's 2-mirror f/24 Ritchey–Chrétien optical design, making it a potentially ideal observatory for [[Dark Energy]] or other astrophysics surveys. The secondary mirror is mounted on a [[Stewart platform|hexapod]] to increase the side-viewing and ground scanning ability for the originally intended reconnaissance mission.&lt;ref name="WP20120604"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20120604"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dressler20120604"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/assets/pdf/A219029465.PDF|title=The NRO-1 2.4-m Telescope|publisher=The National Academies|first=Alan|last=Dressler|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== KH-11 generations===
Five generations of U.S. electro-optical reconnaissance have been identified:&lt;ref name="sfr20090622"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1400/1|title=Gum in the Keyhole|publisher=The Space Review|first=Dwayne|last=Day|date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf20110120"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/01/live-delta-iv-heavy-launch-nro-l-49/|title=Delta IV Heavy launches on debut West Coast launch with NRO L-49|publisher=nasaspaceflight.com|first=William|last=Graham|accessdate=21 January 2011|date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Block I====
Block I refers to the original KH-11 satellite, of which five were launched between 19 December 1976 and 17 November 1982.

==== Block II====
The three Block II satellites are in the open literature referred to as KH-11B, the alleged ''DRAGON'' codename, or ''Crystal'', and are believed to be capable of taking infrared images in addition to optical observations.&lt;ref name="GS20070424"/&gt; The first or second Block II satellite was lost in a launch failure.&lt;ref name="nsf20110120"/&gt;

==== Block III====
Four Block III satellites, commonly called KH-12 or ''Improved Crystal'' were launched between November 1992 and October 2001. The name "Improved Crystal" refers to the "Improved Metric CRYSTAL System" (IMCS), which adds reference markings for accurate mapping to images obtained by the satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 13: U.S. Satellite Imagery, 1960–1999|date=14 April 1999 |first=Jeffrey T.|last=Richelson|publisher= National Security Archive| url=http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB13/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another improvement was an eightfold increase in the download rate compared to earlier models to facilitate improved real-time access and increased   area coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=KH-11 Recons Modified| date=9 October 1995| publisher=Aviation Week| url=http://intellit.muskingum.edu/alpha_folder/a_folder/aw%26st.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626010638/http://intellit.muskingum.edu/alpha_folder/A_folder/aw%26st.html| archivedate=26 June 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Block IV ====
Three electro-optical satellites launched in October 2005,  January 2011, and August 2013 are attributed to Block IV.

==== Block V ====
A new generation of clandestine communications satellites launched to inclined geosynchronous orbits have let to speculations that these are in support of Block V electro-optical satellites scheduled for launch in late 2018 (NROL-71) and 2020 (NROL-82)

==Derivatives==
The ''[[Misty (satellite)|Misty]]'' satellite is believed to have been derived from the KH-11, but modified to make it [[Stealth technology|invisible to radar]], and hard to detect visually. The first Misty satellite, [[USA-53]], was released by the {{OV|104}} on mission [[STS-36]]. The [[USA-144]] satellite, launched on 22 May 1999 by a [[Titan IV]]B from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] may have been a second Misty satellite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/misty.htm |title=Encyclopedia Astronautica – Misty |publisher=Astronautix.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129035529/http://astronautix.com/craft/misty.htm |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or an [[Enhanced Imaging System]] spacecraft. The satellites are sometimes identified as KH-12s.

==Compromise==
[[File:Janeskh11leakedphoto.jpg|right|thumb| KH-11 image of the [[Black Sea Shipyard|construction]] of a Kiev-class aircraft carrier, as published by Jane's in 1984.]]

In 1978, a young CIA employee named [[William Kampiles]] was accused of selling a KH-11 System Technical Manual describing design and operation to the Soviets. Kampiles was convicted of espionage and initially sentenced to 40 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.02/spy_pr.html | title=I Spy | publisher=Wired | author=Patrick Radden Keefe |date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this term was reduced, and after serving 18 years, Kampiles was released in 1996.&lt;ref name="jonathonpollard_kampiles"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Kampiles Case | work = JonathanPollard.org | url = http://www.jonathanpollard.org/kampiles.htm | accessdate =30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bop_kampiles"&gt;{{cite web | title = Record of William Peter Kampiles | work = Inmate Locator | publisher = Federal Bureau of Prisons | url = http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=william&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=Kampiles&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=M&amp;Age=&amp;x=36&amp;y=17 | accessdate =30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 [[Samuel Loring Morison]], an intelligence analyst at the Naval Intelligence Support Center, forwarded three classified images taken by KH-11 to the publication ''[[Jane's Fighting Ships]]''. In 1985, Morison was convicted in Federal Court on two counts of espionage and two counts of theft of government property, and was sentenced to two years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/08/weekinreview/the-nation-two-years-for-morison.html Michael Wright and Caroline Rand Herron, "Two Years for Morison," 8 December 1985].

==KH-11 missions==
[[File:KH-11 Keyhole constellation, September 2013.png|thumb|All KH-11 Keyhole satellites on orbit, orbital constellation status of September 2013]]

Nine KH-11 satellites were launched between 1976 and 1990 aboard [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]]-3D and -34D rockets, with one launch failure. For the following five satellite launches between 1992 and 2005, a [[Titan IV]] launch vehicle was used. The two most recent launches in 2011 and 2013 were carried out by [[Delta IV#Delta IV Heavy|Delta IV Heavy]] rockets. The KH-11 replaced the [[KH-9]] film return satellite, among others, the last of which was lost in a liftoff explosion in 1986.

KH-11 satellites are in either of two standard planes in [[Sun-synchronous orbit]]s. As shadows help to discern ground features, satellites in a standard plane east of a noon/midnight orbit observe the ground at local afternoon hours, while satellites in a western plane observe the ground at local morning hours.&lt;ref name="GS20070425"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/kh-12.htm| title=IMPROVED – ADVANCED CRYSTAL / IKON / 'KH-12'|first=Charles P.|last=Vick|publisher=globalsecurity.org|date=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="satobs20090713"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://satobs.org/seesat_ref/misc/KH-11_lifetime.pdf| title=KH-11 Lifetime|first=Ted|last=Molczan|publisher=satobs.org|date=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SatTrackCam1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sattrackcam.blogspot.nl/2013/09/the-orbit-of-usa-245-and-current-kh-11.html| title=The orbit of USA 245 and the current KH-11 constellation |first=Marco |last=Langbroek|publisher=SatTrackCam Leiden|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically launches have therefore been timed to occur either about two hours before or one hour after local noon (or midnight), respectively.&lt;ref name="nsf20110120"/&gt; The orbits are such that ground-tracks repeat after a certain number of days, currently each four days for the primary satellites in the East and West orbital plane.&lt;ref name="SatTrackCam2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sattrackcam.blogspot.nl/2013/09/on-usa-245-and-usa-129-and-future-of.html| title=On USA 245 and USA 129, and the future of the Keyhole constellation: an afterthought to my previous post |first=Marco |last=Langbroek|publisher=SatTrackCam Leiden|date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constellation consists of two primary and two secondary satellites (one primary and one secondary per plane). The orbital planes of the two primary satellites in the East and West plane are separated by 48 to 50 degrees. The orbital plane of the secondary satellite in the East plane is located 20 degrees to the east of the primary satellite, while the orbital plane of the secondary satellite in the West plane is located 10 degrees to the west of the primary satellite.&lt;ref name="SatTrackCam2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SatTrackCam3"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sattrackcam.blogspot.nl/2013/09/past-and-future-of-kh-11-keyholeevolved.html| title=Past and future of the KH-11 Keyhole/Evolved Enhanced CRYSTAL constellation (part 3)  |first=Marco |last=Langbroek|publisher=SatTrackCam Leiden|date=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KH12 USA129 satellite.jpg|thumb|280px|right|A bright pass of USA-129, a Block III satellite]]

KH-11 satellites require periodic reboosts to counter [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]], or to adjust their ground track to surveillance requirements. Based on data collected by amateur observers, the following orbital characteristics of OPS 5705 were calculated by amateur skywatcher [[Ted Molczan]].&lt;ref name="MSNBC201008"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/spp/military/program/imint/tm120402.html|title=Examples of other 'fake space' claims by governments?|publisher=fas.org|first=Ted|last=Molczan|date=4 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 2010, amateur astrophotographer [[Ralf Vandebergh]] took some pictures of a KH-11 (USA-129) satellite from the ground. The pictures, despite being taken with a 10-inch aperture telescope from a range of 336 kilometers, show major details such as dishes and solar panels, as well as some elements whose function is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/2013/09/26/view-keyhole-satellite/|title=Never Before Seen View of a Keyhole Satellites?|work=Space Safety Magazine |date=2013-09-26|accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==
Estimated unit costs, including launch and in 1990 dollars, range from US$1.25 to 1.75 billion (inflation adjusted US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.25|1990|r=2}}}} to {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.75|1990|r=2}}}} billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref name="CBOPublication528"/&gt;

According to Senator [[Kit Bond]] initial budget estimates for each of the two legacy KH-11 satellites ordered from Lockheed in 2005 were higher than for the latest [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class aircraft carrier]] (CVN-77)&lt;ref name="DN20090602"/&gt; with its projected procurement cost of US$6.35 billion as of May 2005.&lt;ref name="NHC20050525"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/navycvn21.htm |title=Navy CVN-21 Aircraft Carrier Program: Background and Issues for Congress |publisher=Naval Historical Center |first=Ronald |last=O'Rourke |date=25 May 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201055019/http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/navycvn21.htm |archivedate= 1 December 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, after the launch of USA-224, DNRO [[Bruce A. Carlson|Bruce Carlson]] announced that the procurement cost for the satellite had been US$2 billion under the initial budget estimate, which would put it at about US$4.4 billion (inflation adjusted US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4.4|2011|r=2}}}} billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref name="NRO20110907"/&gt;

In April 2014, the NRO assigned a "(...) worth more than $5 billion (...)" to the final two legacy KH-11 satellites.&lt;ref name="NROPR201402"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nro.gov/news/press/2014/02-14.pdf|title=Dr. Darrell Zimbelman Receives 2014 Charyk Award, Release # 02-14|publisher=National Reconnaissance Office|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lausanne–Echallens–Bercher Railway''' ({{lang-fr|Chemin de fer Lausanne-Échallens-Bercher}}, LEB) is a [[metre gauge]] railway in the [[canton of Vaud]] in [[Switzerland]]. The line connects the city of [[Lausanne]] with [[Bercher]] via [[Echallens]], and is {{convert|23.67|km|abbr=on}} long.

== History ==
[[File:LEB Company Logo - La ligne verte.svg|thumb|left|Old logo.]]

After an initial test train ran between [[Lausanne-Chauderon station]] and Prilly-Chasseur on 3 October 1873, the first section of line came into service from Lausanne to Cheseaux on 4 November. The line through to Échallens opened in June 1874. Under a legally separate entity, the route to Bercher was completed and opened on 28 November 1889.

At the Lausanne end of the line, developments came later. Chauderon station was moved underground and the original station [[demolition|razed]] in 1995. Trains continued to terminate at Chauderon until 2000, when an extension to [[Lausanne-Flon station]] opened, permitting interchange with the [[Lausanne Métro]].

== Future ==
Together, the railway company, the canton, and the city of Lausanne have plans to upgrade the line to permit more frequent trains. Building of a new [[double track]] tunnel between [[Lausanne-Chauderon station|Chauderon]] and Montétan stations is expected to take place by 2022, permitting up to 8 trains to run per hour in each direction on the urban section as far as Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne.&lt;ref name="LausanneLEB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lausanne.ch/lausanne-en-bref/lausanne-demain/mobilite/autres-projets/leb.html|title=le LEB - Site officiel de la Ville de Lausanne|publisher=City of Lausanne|accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laško Brewery''' ({{lang-sl|Pivovarna Laško}}) is the largest [[brewery]] in  [[Slovenia]]. It is named after the  town of [[Laško]], where it is located.

[[File:Lasko, slovenia.jpg|thumb|Laško truck near the entrance of town]]
The brewery was founded in 1825 by [[Franz Geyer]], a [[gingerbread]] baker and [[mead]] producer. After [[World War II]] ended in 1945, Laško was the fifth-largest in [[Yugoslavia]], and by 1991 it was the largest among 28 Yugoslav breweries. It lost much of the Yugoslav market in 1991 after Slovenia declared independence and the resulting [[Ten-Day War]], although sales rebounded during the 1990s. 

In 2016 Laško and Union were formally merged into ''Pivovarna Laško Union'' under the Owner Heineken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sloveniatimes.com/lasko-and-union-formally-merged "Laško and Union formally merged"], retrieved 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Day''' is a [[holiday]] in [[Cameroon]] celebrated on 20 May. On the 20th  of May 1972, in a national [[Cameroonian constitutional referendum, 1972|referendum]] Cameroonians voted for a unitary state as opposed to the existing federal state.  The [[United Nations Trust Territory]] known as [[French Cameroun]] achieved independence from France on 1 January 1960, and British [[Southern Cameroons]] changed status from a Trusteeship under British administration to a [[federation|federated]] state within Cameroon on 1 October 1961. The government chose 20 May as Cameroon's National Day to commemorate President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]'s abolishment of the federal system of government in favor  of a [[unitary state|unitary country]] in 1972.

Even though it is considered a holiday, children all over the country go to schools and celebrate [[National Day]] usually by singing, carrying out parades or marches all around the different parts of their various cities.
Speeches are made by the [[Head of State]] and other important personalities.
The day is presided over by the head of state in Yaounde the capital of Cameroon. In the regional headquarters, it is presided by the governor who represents the government. The divisional officers preside over the day in their various divisions.

'''Portuguese art''' includes many different styles from many different eras.

==Sculptures==
Portuguese sculptures can be best analysed by studying the many [[tomb]]s of the 12th and 13th Centuries that are found throughout [[Portugal]]. In the late 1700s, the [[Colonal Brazil|colony of Brazil]] was the main influence in Portuguese [[sculpture]]. This can be seen by the increase in [[Baroque sculpture|Baroque]] wooden sculptures during this time. [[Joaquim Machado de Castro]], a famous Portuguese artist who lived around this time, is responsible for a lot of these works.&lt;ref name="portugal-live"&gt;[http://www.portugal-live.net/UK/essential/culture-arts.html Portugal-Live.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
[[File:GraoVasco.jpg|thumbnail|The Last Supper, [[Grão Vasco]]]]
The Classical and Romantic styles of [[painting]], brought to Portugal from [[Italy]] and [[France]], had an influence on Portuguese artist [[Machado de Castro]] in the late 18th century and [[António Soares dos Reis]] in the 19th century. A school for amateur painters, led by [[Nuno Gonçalves]], was popular in the 15th century. As a result, [[Flemish]] artists added to the native style by decorating palaces and convents using their own techniques. The result gave Portugal a rich heritage of [[religious art]]. The Romantic Period in the 19th century sparked a rebirth of national art. This was followed by an era of naturalist realism, which in turn was followed by experimentation the 20th century.&lt;ref name="portugal-live" /&gt;

==Contemporary artists==
Many Portuguese contemporary artists have made their mark on the world stage. [[Maria Helena Vieira de Silva]] was a famous Portuguese abstract painter and [[Carlos Botelho (painter)|Carlos Botelho]] was known for his street scenes of [[Lisbon]]. [[Paula Rego]] is known for her "storytelling" in painting. She became famous for her works "Dog Woman" (1990’s), and "Abortion", a reaction to the referendum in Portugal which made [[abortion]] a crime (late 1990s). Her art has been shown in museums such as [[Tate Modern]] in London and Casa das Histórias Paula Rego, in [[Cascais]] (dedicated solely to her art).&lt;ref name="portugal-live" /&gt;

==Azulejos==
The Portuguese glazed tiles ([[azulejo]]s) are one of Portugal's best decorative arts. Many 16th and 17th century buildings are lined with tiles, and the rooms and halls of palaces and mansions have tilted panels following a colour motif. Some prime examples of this style of art are the [[Pátio da Carranca]] (courtyard of Carranca) of the [[Paço de Sintra]] (Palace of Sintra), the [[Igreja de São Roque (Lisbon)|São Roque]] church in Lisbon and the [[Quinta da Bacalhoa]] at [[Vila Fresca de Azeitão]] near [[Setúbal]].&lt;ref name="portugal-live" /&gt;

At first, it was owned by Italian businessmen, then a Greek businessman and finally by Albanian media mogul Aleksander Frangaj. The channel launched in 1997/8 in Albania and used to be available via analogue in central Albania and later on satellite in Europe on the Albanian TV package [[DigitAlb]].

Traditionally, the channel broadcast a variety of programming but its core focus remained news programming and soap operas from Italy. In 2002, it was ranked fourth with 11.3% audience share. TeleNorba was the only affiliated channel to [[TV Klan]] which had the right to broadcast Njerez te humbur (Missing people) but did not hold the rights to broadcast the program live. Indeed, the program debuted on TNSH.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvklan.blogspot.com/2009/04/njerez-te-humbur.html TV Klan Blog&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 2010, after some successful take overs from imminent bankruptcy, the channel was rebranded to [[ABC News (Albania)|ABC News]].

== History ==
Due to the success of Italian media worldwide and their reach in Albania, the broadcaster decided to launch a new channel called Telenorba which would broadcast Italian programming to Albanian audiences. The ownership was made up of Italian and Albanian businessmen and a private company. Afterwards, it rebranded to "TeleNorba Shqiptare or TNSH" while programmes started to be subtitled in the [[Albanian language]]. Colpo Grosso, a late night adult show became a huge success together with soap operas from Latin America. The channel gained popularity and was able to expand its range of programing to include many Albanian programs and a high-profile news bulletin. At midnight, TNSH used to simulcast the Italian version of the channel.

== Satellite broadcasting ==
Despite having been one of the youngest channels created by the TeleNorba company, TeleNorba Shqiptare was the only channel to broadcast by satellite in Europe.

==Logo==
The first logo was a white 'TN' symbol taken from the original Telenorba channel in Italy. An amber version followed, while later the letters 'SH' denoting "Shqiptare" were added as the colors were changed to transparent blue letters on white background. Finally, the logo was replaced with the transparent logo of the existing Italian channel.

'''''Une Affaire de nègres''''' is a 2006 documentary film.

== Synopsis ==
March 20, 2000, a decree by the President of the Republic of [[Cameroon]] set up an Operational Command Unit to tackle rampant banditry in the [[Douala]] region. The Unit introduced what amounted to round-ups: in one year, 1600 people disappeared or were killed. One year later, nine young men disappeared. The matter was submitted to the [[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]]. The accused were found guilty of "failure to follow orders" and released but legal proceedings have not come to an end. The victims' families have to live between the desire for justice and the pressure for the crimes to be wiped out forever from the collective memory.

'''Užgavėnės''' is a [[Lithuania]]n festival that takes place during the seventh week before [[Easter]] (Ash Wednesday). Its name in [[English language|English]] means ''"the time before [[Lent]]"''. The celebration corresponds to [[Roman Catholic]] holiday traditions in other parts of the world, such as [[Mardi Gras]], [[Shrove Tuesday]], and [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnaval]].

Užgavėnės begins on the night before [[Ash Wednesday]], when an [[effigy]] of winter (usually named [[Marzanna|''Morė'']]) is burnt. A major element of the holiday, meant to symbolize the defeat of winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], is a staged battle between ''Lašininis'' ("porky") personifying winter and ''Kanapinis'' ("[[hemp]]en man") personifying spring. Devils, witches, goats, the [[grim reaper]], [[Romani people|gypsies]], and other joyful and frightening characters appear in costumes during the celebrations. The participants and masqueraders dance and eat the traditional dish of the holiday - [[pancake]]s with a variety of toppings.

In Lithuania's capital [[Vilnius]], the celebration takes place on [[Gediminas Avenue]], as well as at many youth organizations. The festival is a major event at [[Rumšiškės]] open-air ethnographic museum. Participants traditionally dress and act as [[Romani people]] and [[Jews]], wearing masks with grotesque features, beards and visible ear locks and engaging in peddling and stereotypically Jewish speech.&lt;ref&gt;http://forward.com/news/12634/jews-parade-on-the-streets-of-vilna-01253/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/nazi-inspired-anti-semitic-imagery-used-promote-lithuanian-festival-sparks-outrage-2505357&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wanda Quilhot''' (born 1929) is a [[Chileans|Chilean]] [[biologist]], most noted for her work in [[lichenology]]. She was among the first women [[scientist|scientists]] allowed to participate in research in [[Antarctica]] with the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU), conducting research there beginning in 1963. Three lichen species ''[[Menegazzia wandae]]'', ''Pseudocyphellaria wandae'', and ''Strigula wandae'' have been named in her honor. The Latin American Group of Lichenology has created a prize in her name to recognize research excellence in the field of lichenology.

==Early life==
Wanda Quilhot Palma was born in Chile in 1930.{{sfn|Universidad de Valparaiso|2016}} As a child, she wanted to be a nurse, but after a childhood accident left her in a cast and with a [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction device]], forcing her to remain bedfast for five years, she changed her mind. Unable to study during her confinement, by the time she finished her secondary education, Quilhot was twenty-four. At the time, women were not encouraged to pursue university degrees, but her sister an uncle, Octavio Palma, a noted Chilean educator, advocated for her to pursue further education. In 1955, she enrolled in biology courses and worked at the newly created Institute of Zoological Research, under {{ill|Guillermo Mann|es}},{{sfn|Carvajal|2012|p=181}} finishing her degree in 1959.{{sfn|CONICYT|2013}}

==Career==
That same year, Quilhot began teaching as a professor of biology and natural sciences at the [[University of Chile]].{{sfn|CONICYT|2013}} Winning a scholarship to attend the [[University of Paris]] and study [[plant physiology]] and [[algae]] in the Faculty of Sciences. After spending three years, studying, she left without finishing her PhD, because she missed her husband.{{sfn|Carvajal|2012|p=181}} In the summer season of 1963–1964, Quilhot and Nelly Lafuente become some of the first women to conduct research in [[Antarctica]]. Women had long been barred from [[Women in Antarctica|working in Antarctica]] as it was assumed that they lacked the stamina and mental toughness to deal with the inhospitable climate and working conditions.{{sfn|Hament|2001}} In 1952 the [[International Council for Science]] began planning the International Geophysical Year 1957–1958 with the idea of including women scientists and Lafuente and Quilhot were the first two women from Chile to work in Antarctica. Working for the Instituto Antarctico Chileno at the Bernado O’Higgins Station on the northeast edge of the peninsula, Lafuente evaluated bird reproduction, while Quihot, studied the local fauna.{{sfn|Brears|n.d.}} 

Quilhot's research focused on microfauna, and the [[bryophyte]]s and soil-forming microorganisms which were causing degradation of the soil. The research she conducted in Antarctica created a fascination with lichens for Quihot, which became the focus of her work for the next forty years.{{sfn|Carvajal|2012|p=183}} She has studied with groups of international scholars researching various lichen species at diverse altitudinal and latitudinal environments, examining the different effects of [[UVA radiation]] and [[UVB radiation]].{{sfn|Carvajal|2012|p=184}} She has written over 200 articles in scientific journals and three lichen species ''[[Menegazzia wandae]]'', ''Pseudocyphellaria wandae'', and ''Strigula wandae'' have been named in her honor.{{sfn|Universidad de Valparaiso|2016}} She teaches in the Faculty of Medicine in the School of Chemistry and Pharmacy, at the [[Universidad de Valparaíso]].{{sfn|CONICYT|2013}} At the 12th Congress of the Latin American Group of Lichenology {{lang-es|Grupo Latinoamericano de Liquenología}}, held in [[Quito]], Ecuador in 2016, she was awarded the Vainio Prize for her research on lichens and the Wanda Quilhot Palma Prize was established to recognize research excellence in the field of lichenology.{{sfn|Universidad de Valparaiso|2016}}
