'''Abu Muhammad ʿAbdallah 'al-ʿAdil'''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الله}} ''ʿAbd Allāh''; d. October 4, 1227) was an [[Almohad]] Caliph of [[Morocco]], a former governor in [[al-Andalus]] who challenged and secured the murder of his predecessor, [[Abdul-Wahid I, Almohad Caliph|Abd al-Wahid I]]. His 1224 coup ushered in a period of instability that lasted well beyond his own death in 1227. He is often regarded as one of the most disastrous of Almohad caliphs.  His coup divided the Almohads and set in motion the loss of al-Andalus and the eventual collapse of the Almohad state.

==Background==
[[File:Almohad1200.png|thumb|Almohad realm of the 13th century]]
Abu Muhammad Abdallah was a son of [[Almohad]] conqueror [[Yaqub al-Mansur]] and a brother of the famous caliph [[Muhammad al-Nasir]].  Along with his other brothers, Abdallah served as an Almohad governor in [[al-Andalus]].&lt;ref name = kennedy&gt;H. Kennedy (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the premature death of his nephew, the young Caliph [[Yusuf II, Almohad Caliph|Yusuf II al-Mustansir]], without heirs, in January 1224, the Marrakesh palace bureaucrats, led by the [[vizier]] Abu Sa'id Uthman ibn Jami'i and the regional [[Masmuda]] tribal sheikhs, engineered the election of his elderly grand-uncle as the new caliph [[Abdul-Wahid I, Almohad Caliph|Abd al-Wahid I]], and presented it to the remaining Almohad family members as a ''fait accompli''.  Abdallah, then governing in [[Murcia]], and his brothers, Abu al-'Ala Idris (governing in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]]), Abu Musa (in [[Málaga]]) and Abu al-Hassan (in [[Granada]]), who formed a powerful clique in Almohad hierarchy, were upset at the hastiness and the probable unconstitutionality of the Marrakesh proceedings.&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;  Moreover, Abd al-Wahid I, despite his age, had a distinguished record and centralizing tendencies, and was less likely to give the brothers free rein in al-Andalus as the young, neglectful Yusuf II had done.

The [[Almohad dynasty]] had never had a disputed succession. Despite disagreements, they had always loyally lined up behind the elected caliph, so rebellion was no casual matter.  But Abdallah was soon visited in Murcia by the shadowy figure of Abu Zayd ibn Yujjan, a former high bureaucrat in Marrakesh, whose fall had been engineered some years earlier by al-Jami'i, and was  now serving a sentence of exile nearby in [[Chinchilla de Monte-Aragón|Chinchilla]] ([[Province of Albacete|Albacete]]).&lt;ref name = kennedy&gt;H. Kennedy (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Yujjan persuaded Abdallah to contest the election, assuring him of his high connections in the Marrakesh palace and among the Masmuda sheikhs.  In consultation with his brothers, Abdallah soon declared himself as the new Almohad caliph, taking up the caliphal title of "''al-Adil''" ("the Just" or "the Justicer") and immediately seized [[Seville]], and began make preparations to march on Marrakesh and confront Abd al-Wahid I.  But Ibn Yajjan had already pulled on his Moroccan connections. Before the end of the summer, Abu Zakariya, the sheikh of the Hintata tribe, and Yusuf ibn Ali, governor of Tinmal, declared for al-Adil, seized the Marrakesh palace, deposed the caliph and expelled al-Jami'i and his coterie.  The fallen caliph Abd al-Wahid I was murdered by strangulation in September 1224.

==Aftermath==
Abdallah al-Adil's murderous breach of dynastic precedence and constitutional propriety shocked the rest of the Almohads.  But Abdallah and his brothers were dominant in al-Andalus, and had little trouble imposing themselves on the province, replacing those who refused to recognize the usurpation.  In Spain, everyone fell in line, with the notable exception of three of Abdallah's cousins, (the sons of Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Abi Hafs, the powerful governor of [[Ifriqiya]]):  Abu Zayd (governor of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]), Abd Allah (governor of [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]]) and [[Idris II, Almohad Caliph|Abu Dabbus]].&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;   They were promptly deprived of their posts.  The Jaén governor, Abd Allah (nicknamed "al-Bayyasi", the [[Baeza]]n), took a small group of followers and set up camp in the hills of Baeza, calling for open rebellion against al-Adil.

In Morocco, Abdallah al-Adil's coup had barely succeeded.  Many (most?) of the Masmuda tribal sheikhs, unwilling to see the balance in the Almohad coalition swinging into the hands of the Almohads of Spain, invoked their constitutional role, and refused to ratify al-Adil's usurpation, rallying instead around the figure of his nephew [[Yahya, Almohad Caliph|Yahya]], the son of al-Nasir.  With the coup in danger of being reversed, Abdallah al-Adil made the fateful decision to begin shipping the bulk of the Almohad forces in Spain across the [[Straits of Gibraltar|straits]] to Morocco, intending to march on Marrakesh and imposing himself on the sheikhs.

Eager to depart, al-Adil undertook only a half-hearted effort to dislodge al-Bayyasi from the hills of Baeza in the winter of 1224-25. The campaign proved a humiliation – al-Bayyasi's little band of followers managed to fend off the much larger armies that al-Adil sent after them.&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;  Al-Adil quickly acquired a reputation for incompetence and poor military skills, which spread across the water to Morocco, emboldening the recusants and shaking the confidence of his allies.  Determined to seize Marrakesh before it was too late, al-Adil decided to ignore al-Bayyasi and stepped up the transportation of troops.  Al-Bayyasi, in the meantime, struck up an alliance with the hitherto quiet [[Ferdinand III of Castile]]. Bemused at the turn of events, and delighted at the evacuation of Almohad troops, Ferdinand sensed an opportunity and decided to lend al-Bayyasi a large [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] army.

In 1225, al-Bayyasi's band, accompanied by the Castilian army, descended from the Baeza hills. With al-Andalus practically denuded of Almohad troops, they [[Siege of Jaén (1225)|ravaged the lands]] of [[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaén]], the [[vega de Granada]] and by the end of the summer, al-Bayyasi had captured the city of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt; Seeing the vacuity, [[Alfonso IX of Leon]] and [[Sancho II of Portugal]] also took the opportunity to launch their own raids.  [[Cáceres, Spain|Caceres]] held up the Leonese, but the Portuguese raiders, facing no opposition, advanced rapidly and reached the outskirts of [[Seville]] in late 1225.

==Heroes and cowards==
It is reported that the Caliph Al-Adil, his minister Abu Zayd ibn Yajjan and leading Almohad commanders were at that moment in Seville, but they did not have the manpower to challenge the Christian army in the open.&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;  As a result, the Portuguese raiders ravaged the outlying areas with impunity.  At length, the civilian population of Seville, disgusted at the inactivity of the Almohad rulers, decided to take matters into their own hands.  A popular [[levée en masse|levy]] was raised in the city and marched out on their own to meet the Portuguese in the field. It was a massacre.  The Portuguese men-at-arms mowed down the poorly armed townsfolk.  Thousands – in one report as much as 20,000 – were slain before the walls of Seville.&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;

Blame for the Seville massacre – and other disasters – was placed fully on the incompetence and cowardice of Caliph al-Adil and his Almohad lieutenants.  But al-Adil's fortunes soon turned.  Al-Bayyasi had promised three frontier fortresses to Ferdinand III in payment for his services.  But one of the fortresses, [[Capilla, Badajoz|Capilla]], refused to pass over.  The Castilians were forced to lay a long and difficult siege.  The brave defiance of little Capilla, and al-Bayyasi's shipping of provisions to the Castilian besiegers, soon turned opinion against him and back towards the Almohad Caliph.  An uprising in Cordoba followed, al-Bayyasi was killed and his head dispatched to the Caliph in Marrakesh.&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;

But Abdallah al-Adil did not relish this victory for long. On October 4, 1227,&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt; he was drowned in a palace bathtub, and his nephew and rival was elected as the new Almohad Caliph [[Yahya, Almohad Caliph|Yahya 'al-Mutasim']].

'''Aberoh and Atom''' are [[martyr]]s of the [[Christian church]].

These brothers were citizens of [[Gamnudi]] in [[Egypt]]. They fled Gamnudi during a persecution for [[Pelusium]] (then Farama). They were arrested at [[Alexandria]] and tortured. After being dismissed by the prefect, they went next to Baramon, where they were [[decapitation|beheaded]]. Their [[relics]] were returned to Gamnudi. Their [[feast day]] is July 2 in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=6065/ St. Aberoh (Aburom, Arianus)] Retrieved on 15 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}

'''Affection,''' '''attraction''', '''infatuation''', or '''fondness''' is a "[[disposition]] or state of mind or body"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/affection|title=Affection - Define Affection at Dictionary.com|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is often associated with a [[feeling]] or type of [[love]]. It has given rise to a number of branches of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] concerning emotion, disease, influence, and state of being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/LD7Hutcheson.html|title=17th and 18th Century Theories of Emotions &gt; Francis Hutcheson on the Emotions (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|website=Plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Affection" is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of [[love]], amounting to more than goodwill or [[friendship]]. Writers on [[ethics]] generally use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic. Some contrast it with ''[[passion (emotion)|passion]]'' as being free from the distinctively sensual element.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Affection|volume=1|pages=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even a very simple demonstration of affection can have a broad variety of emotional reactions, from embarrassment to disgust to pleasure and annoyance. It also has a different physical effect on the giver and the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Effects of Affection {{!}} Research Matters|url = https://researchmatters.asu.edu/stories/effects-affection-960|website = researchmatters.asu.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restricted definition==
[[File:Smooches (baby and child kiss).jpg|thumb|right|A young girl kisses a baby on the cheek.]]
More specifically, the word has been restricted to [[emotion]]al states, the object of which is a living thing such as a human or animal.  Affection is compared with passion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=94G2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=affection+vs+passion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3o_XQqMrXAhWFXRoKHRb6CnwQuwUIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cuba and the Politics of Passion|first=Damián J.|last=Fernández|date=1 January 2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|accessdate=19 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;, from the Greek "[[pathos]]". As such it appears in the writings of [[France|French]] philosopher [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/descartes1649part2.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Passions of the Soul|author=René Descartes|website=Earlymoderntexts.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netherlands|Dutch]] philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/spinoza-psychological/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Michael|last=LeBuffe|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=19 November 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=19 November 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and most of the writings of early British ethicists. However, on various grounds (e.g., that it does not involve anxiety or excitement and that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element), it is generally and usefully distinguished from passion.{{clarification|date=November 2017}} In this narrower sense, the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental ''affections'' as in some sense a part of moral obligations.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; For a consideration of these and similar problems, which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/sidgwick1874book4.pdf|p=345–349|title=Methods of Ethics|website=Earlymoderntexts.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expression==
{{Further information|Public display of affection}}
Affection can be communicated by looks, words, gestures, or touches. Affectionate behavior may have evolved from parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards.&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Communication]] professor Kory Floyd of the [[University of Arizona]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such affection has been shown to influence brain development in infants.&lt;ref&gt;Infant Observation: International Journal of Infant Observation and Its Applications&lt;/ref&gt; 
Expressions of affection can be unwelcome if they pose implied threats to one's well being. If welcomed, affectionate behavior  may be associated with  various health benefits. It has been proposed that positive sentiments increase the propensity of people to interact and that familiarity gained through affection increases positive sentiments among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techsociety.com/articles/JMF_Lawtonetal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316162825/http://www.techsociety.com/articles/JMF_Lawtonetal.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of affection===
Affection exchange is seen as an adaptive human behavior that contributes to greater physical and mental well-being. The expression of affection mediates emotional, physical, and relational benefits for the individual and significant counterparts. The communication of positive feelings towards others has shown health benefits that include; lower stress hormones, lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure and stronger immune system. [https://asunow.asu.edu/content/study-expressing-love-can-improve-your-health Affection Expression ] Benefits are internally noticed when the emotion is expressed and not merely felt, if affection is not reciprocated through the receiver, effects of the affection are still felt through the giver. 

===Parental relationships===
Affectionate behavior is often regarded as the result of parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards. Positive and negative parental behaviors can be linked to later life health problems. Abuse is a common attribute to poor health in later life, as the lack of affection leads to naturally poorer well-being and mental health. A 2013 study, [http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/lack-of-parental-warmth-abuse-248580 UCLA affection ] showed the effects of early child abuse and the outcome between lack of affection and the strong biological link for how these negative early-life experiences affect physical health.

The '''Allied Quality Assurance Publications (AQAP)''' are standards for quality assurance systems that have been developed by [[NATO]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/stanags/current/4107eed08a8.pdf |title=Stanag 4107 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.difesa.it/SGD-DNA/STAFF/DT/NAVARM/Pagine/AQAP.aspx  |title=Link to current AQAP publications |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the AQAP agreement is to define standards for Quality Assurance of defence products. These standards are an integral part of contracts awarded in the military field involving NATO member countries. AQAP documents are therefore important to contractors and companies wanting to bid for such contracts.

The AQAP system is described in [[STANAG]] 4107 issued by the [[NATO Standardization Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nso.nato.int/nso/ |title=Nato Standardization Office homepage |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently two main types of AQAP documents; Contractual Type which are written as a Technical Specification intended for contractual use; and Guidance Type which provide general guidance.

== List of current AQAP publications ==

* AQAP 160 NATO Integrated Quality Requirements for Software throughout the Life Cycle
* AQAP 169 NATO Guidance on the Use of AQAP 160 Ed.1
* AQAP 2000 NATO Policy on an Integrated Systems Approach to Quality through the Life Cycle

'''Bhavabhuti''' was an 8th-century scholar of [[India]] noted for his plays and poetry, written in [[Sanskrit]]. His plays are considered equivalent to the works of [[Kalidasa]]. Bhavbhuti was born in Padmapura, [[Vidarbha]], in Gondia district, on [[Maharashtra]] and Madhya Pradesh border. 
His real name was ''Srikantha Nilakantha'', and he was the son of Nilakantha and Jatukarni. He received his education at 'Padmapawaya', a place some 42&amp;nbsp;km South-West of [[Gwalior]].
Paramhans Dnyananidhi is known to be his [[guru]]. He composed his historical plays at 'Kalpi', a place on banks of river [[Yamuna]].

He is believed to have been the court poet of king [[Yashovarman]] of [[Kannauj]]. [[Kalhana]], the 12th-century historian, places him in the entourage of the king, who was defeated by [[Lalitaditya Muktapida]], king of Kashmir, in 736 AD.He also wrote Abhinav shakuntalam and displayed in court of King Bhoja of Ujjain but this was without any poetic editing, King Bhoja liked that but people didn't like it much compared to kalidasa's Abhigyan shakuntalam. so Bhavbhuti became very sad and burn whole Abhinav shakuntalam then he prayed and questioned to Devi
Saraswati so she answered that
In your play emotions were missing &amp; you did unnecessary comparison of your creation with Kalidasa's creation. After these valuable inputs 
he became confident and applied
ash of burnt Abhinav Shakuntalam to his body so he became famous by name Bhavbhuti where Bhav means ash &amp; bhuti means body
and wrote other plays and became
famous like Kalidasa. Excerpt from speech of Pandurang Shastri Athavale  written here by Dev Darshan Parikh

==Malatimadhava==
The play is set in the city of Padmavati. The king desires that his minister's daughter Malati marry a youth called Nandana. Malati is in love with Madhava ever since she saw him and drew his portrait. Madhava reciprocates, and draws a portrait of her in turn. Malati suspects her father's motives in falling in with the King's plans for her. A side plot involves the lovers' friends Makaranda and Madayantika. The latter is attacked by a tiger, and Makaranda rescues her, getting wounded in the process. After numerous travails, all ends well, with the two couples uniting. According to the renowned Sanskritist [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel H.H. Ingalls]], the Malatimadhava is a work that combines love and horror with a felicity never again equaled in Sanskrit literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = An Anthology of Sanskrit Court Poetry |author1=Vidyakara | author2=Daniel H.H. Ingalls|publisher=[[Harvard Oriental Series]] Volume 44|page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indebtedness to [[Chanakya|Kautilya]] and [[Arthashastra]]==
According to [[Dasharatha Sharma]], the dramatists [[Kalidasa]] and Bhavabhuti utilized the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' of [[Chanakya|Kautilya]] while composing their famous works. Kalidasa is indebted to Kautilya's ''Arthashastra'' for material in the ''Raghuvamsa''.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Historical Quarterly Vol XXV, part 2&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Bhavabhuti utilizes words and ideas from the ''Arthashastra'' in the ''Malatimadhava'' and the ''Mahaviracharita''. There is indeed a striking resemblance between the methods advocated by  ''Ravana's'' minister, ''Malayavana''  and the policies suggested by Kautilya in the ''Arthashastra''.&lt;ref&gt;'Bhavabhuti's Indebtedness to Kautilya' Journal of the Ganganath Jha Research Institute Vol VIII, part 3, May 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Late Laxmanrao Mankar Guruji named his education society as "Bhavbhuti Education Society" in 1950.
Yashodabai Rahile founded "Bhavbhuti Mandal" (community) in 1996. O.C. Patel published a book "Bhavbhuti ab geeton mein" (Bhavbhuti, now in his songs), he also has published some audio CDs and cassettes to keep the legend's memories alive. State's local TV channel, [[Sayhyadri]] and E TV [[Marathi language|Marathi]] telecasts some documentaries on the life of this great poet. People and some non profit groups have erected a few statues in the region where the poet belongs to.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27784">A '''biosimilar''' (also known as '''follow-on biologic''' or '''subsequent entry biologic''') is a [[biopharmaceutical|biologic medical product]] that is almost an identical copy of an original product that is manufactured by a different company.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, A., Helene D'Iorio and Robert Ford. "What you need to know to succeed: Key trends in Canada's biotech industry " Insights, spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Biosimilars are officially approved versions of original "innovator" products and can be manufactured when the original product's [[chemical patent|patent]] expires.&lt;ref name="biosimilars2012" /&gt; Reference to the innovator product is an integral component of the approval.

Unlike with [[generic drug]]s of the more common [[small molecule|small-molecule]] type, biologics generally exhibit high molecular complexity and may be quite sensitive to changes in manufacturing processes. Despite that heterogeneity, all [[biopharmaceutical]]s, including biosimilars, must maintain consistent quality and clinical performance throughout their lifecycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamanna|first=William C.|last2=Holzmann|first2=Johann|last3=Cohen|first3=Hillel P.|last4=Guo|first4=Xinghua|last5=Schweigler|first5=Monika|last6=Stangler|first6=Thomas|last7=Seidl|first7=Andreas|last8=Schiestl|first8=Martin|date=2018-01-10|title=Maintaining consistent quality and clinical performance of biopharmaceuticals|journal=Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=369–379|doi=10.1080/14712598.2018.1421169|issn=1744-7682|pmid=29285958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Follow-on manufacturers do not have access to the originator's molecular clone and original cell bank, to the exact fermentation and purification process, or to the active drug substance, but they have access to the commercialized innovator product. Overall, it is harder to ascertain [[fungibility]] between generics and innovators among biologics than it is among [[total synthesis|totally synthesized]] and [[semisynthesis|semisynthesized]] drugs. That is why the name "biosimilar" was coined to differentiate them from small-molecule generics. A simple analogy, often used to explain the difference, is to compare wine with soda pop. It is harder to say objectively that two bottles of [[wine]] from two wineries are "sufficiently interchangeable," because of differences in yeast [[strain (biology)|strain]], weather, and year of grape harvest, than it is to say that two bottles of soda pop of the same flavor coming from two bottling plants are "sufficiently interchangeable" because they contain the same flavoring powder.

Drug-related authorities such as the EU's [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA), the US's [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[Health Products and Food Branch]] of [[Health Canada]] hold their own guidance on requirements for demonstration of the similar nature of two biological products in terms of safety and efficacy. According to them, analytical studies demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product, despite minor differences in clinically inactive components, animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity), and a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics). They are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and is intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.

In case of a [[monoclonal antibody]]-containing medicinal product, such as [[Remsima]], extensive physicochemical and biological characterization for it and its reference product Remicade was conducted to demonstrate their highly-similar properties. Therefore, EMA has granted a marketing authorisation for only a few biosimilars since 2006, including a [[monoclonal antibody]], that was recently approved. Meanwhile, on March 6, 2015, the FDA approved the United States's first biosimilar product, the biosimilar of [[filgrastim]] called filgrastim-sndz (trade name Zarxio) by Sandoz.

==Approval processes ==
The European regulatory authorities led with a specially adapted approval procedure to authorize subsequent versions of previously approved biologics, termed "similar biological medicinal products", or biosimilars. This procedure is based on a thorough demonstration of "comparability" of the "similar" product to an existing approved product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/pages/includes/document/open_document.jsp?webContentId=WC500003517|title=EMEA Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products, CHMP/437/04 London, 30 October 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) held that new legislation was required to enable them to approve biosimilars to those biologics originally approved through the PHS Act pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1239&amp;wit_id=3623|title=US Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Testimony of Dr. Lester Crawford, Acting Commissioner, FDA June 23, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional Congressional hearings have been held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-he-hrg.050207.Biosimilar.shtml Hearing: Assessing the Impact of a Safe and Equitable Biosimilar Policy in the United States.

Since 2004 the FDA has held a series of public meetings on biosimilars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/ucm085854.htm|title=FDA page on "Follow-On Protein Products: Regulatory and Scientific Issues Related to Developing"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm221688.htm|title=FDA page on "Approval Pathway for Biosimilar and Interchangeable Biological Products Public Meeting"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA gained the authority to approve biosimilars (including interchangeables that are substitutable with their reference product) as part of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] signed by President Obama on March 23, 2010.

The FDA has previously approved biologic products using comparability, for example, [[Omnitrope]] in May 2006, but this like [[Enoxaparin]] was also to a reference product, [[Genotropin]], originally approved as a [[biologic drug]] under the FD&amp;C Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04P0231/04P-0231-pdn0001.pdf|title=FDA Response to three Citizen Petitions against biosimilars|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2015, [[Zarxio]] obtained the first approval of FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm436648.htm|title=FDA page on "FDA approves first biosimilar product Zarxio"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandoz’s Zarxio is biosimilar to Amgen’s Neupogen (filgrastim), which was originally licensed in 1991. This is the first product to be passed under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act), which was passed as part of the Affordable Healthcare Act. But Zarxio was approved as a biosimilar, not as an interchangeable product, the FDA notes. And under the BPCI Act, only a biologic that has been approved as an “interchangeable” may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The FDA said its approval of Zarxio is based on review of evidence that included structural and functional characterization, animal study data, human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data, clinical immunogenicity data and other clinical safety and effectiveness data that demonstrates [[Zarxio]] is biosimilar to Neupogen.

==Background==
Cloning of human genetic material and development of in vitro biological production systems has allowed the production of virtually any [[recombinant DNA]] based biological substance for eventual development of a drug. [[Monoclonal antibody]] technology combined with recombinant DNA technology has paved the way for tailor-made and targeted medicines. [[gene therapy|Gene-]] and [[cell therapy|cell-based]] therapies are emerging as new approaches.

Recombinant therapeutic [[proteins]] are of a complex nature (composed of a long chain of amino acids, modified amino acids, derivatized by sugar moieties, folded by complex mechanisms). These proteins are made in living cells (bacteria, yeast, animal or human cell lines). The ultimate characteristics of a drug containing a recombinant therapeutic protein are to a large part determined by the process through which they are produced: choice of the cell type, development of the genetically modified cell for production, production process,  purification process, formulation of the therapeutic protein into a drug.

After the expiry of the patent of approved recombinant drugs (e.g., [[insulin]],  human [[growth hormone]], [[interferons]], [[erythropoietin]], monoclonal antibodies and more) any other biotech company can develop and market these [[biologic medical product|biologics]] (thus called biosimilars).
Every biological (or biopharmaceutical products) displays a certain degree of variability, even between different batches of the same product, which is due to the inherent variability of the biological expression system and the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name="pmid25298038"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/early/2014/10/08/blood-2014-06-583617 | author = Martina Weise | title = Biosimilars: the science of extrapolation | journal = Blood |date=October 8, 2014 | pmid = 25298038 | doi=10.1182/blood-2014-06-583617 | volume=124 | issue = 22 | pages=3191–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any kind of reference product has undergone numerous changes in its manufacturing processes, and such changes in the manufacturing process (ranging from a change in the supplier of cell culture media to new purification methods or new manufacturing sites) was substantiated with appropriate data and was approved by the EMA. In contrast, it is mandatory for biosimilars to take a both non-clinical and clinical test that the most sensitive clinical models are asked to show to enable detection of differences between the two products in terms of human [[pharmacokinetics]] (PK) and [[pharmacodynamics]] (PD), efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.

The current concept of development of biosimilar mAbs follows the principle that an extensive state of the art physicochemical, analytical and functional comparison of the molecules is complemented by comparative non-clinical and clinical data that establish equivalent efficacy and safety in a clinical "model" indication that is most sensitive to detect any minor differences (if these exist) between biosimilar and its reference mAb also at the clinical level.

The [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) has recognized this fact, which has resulted in the establishment of the term "biosimilar" in recognition that, whilst biosimilar products are similar to the original product, they are not exactly the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/biosimilar/043704en.pdf  EMEA  guideline on similar biological medicinal products] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630132050/http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/biosimilar/043704en.pdf |date=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Every biological displays a certain degree of variability. However, provided that structure and function(s), pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic effect(s) and/or efficacy can be shown to be comparable for the biosimilar and the reference product, those adverse drug reactions which are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects can also be expected at similar frequencies.

Originally the complexity of biological molecules led to requests for substantial efficacy and safety data for a biosimilar approval. This has been progressively replaced with a greater dependence on assays, from quality through to clinical, that show assay sensitivity sufficient to detect any significant difference in dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=JB|title=Generics, chemisimilars and biosimilars: is clinical testing fit for purpose?|journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol|year=2013|volume=75|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04323.x|pmid=22574725|pmc=3555041}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the safe application of biologics depends on an informed and appropriate use by healthcare professionals and patients. Introduction of biosimilars also requires a specifically designed [[pharmacovigilance]] plan. It is difficult and costly to recreate biologics because the complex proteins are derived from living organisms that are genetically modified. In contrast, small molecule drugs made up of a chemically based compound can be easily replicated and are considerably less expensive to reproduce. In order to be released to the public, biosimilars must be shown to be as close to identical to the parent innovator biologic product based on data compiled through clinical, animal, analytical studies and conformational status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.bioprocessintl.com/manufacturing/biosimilars/higher-order-structure-comparability/|title = Higher-Order Structure Comparability: Case Studies of Biosimilar Monoclonal Antibodies|last = Wang|first = X.|date = June 1, 2014|journal = BioProcess International|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |issue = 6|volume = 12|pages=32–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23286777"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Declerck PJ | title = Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies: a science-based regulatory challenge | journal = Expert Opin Biol Ther | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 153–6 |date=February 2013 | pmid = 23286777 | doi = 10.1517/14712598.2012.758710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, once a drug is released in the market by FDA, it has to be re-evaluated for its safety and efficacy once every six months for the first and second years. Afterward, re-evaluations are conducted yearly, and the result of the assessment should be reported to authorities such as FDA. Biosimilars are required to undergo pharmacovigilance (PVG) regulations as its reference product. Thus biosimilars approved by EMEA (European Medicines Agency) are required to submit a risk management plan (RMP) along with the marketing application and have to provide regular safety update reports after the product is in the market. The RMP includes the safety profile of the drug and proposes the prospective pharmacovigilance studies.

Several PK studies, such as studies conducted by Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), have been conducted under various ranges of conditions; Antibodies from an originator’s product versus antibodies from an biosimilar; combination therapy and monotherapy; various diseases, etc. on the purpose to verify comparability in pharmacokinetics of the biosimilar with the reference medicinal product in a sufficiently sensitive and homogeneous population. Importantly, provided that structure and function(s), pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic effect(s) and/or efficacy can be shown to be comparable for the biosimilar and the reference product, those adverse drug reactions which are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects can also be expected at similar frequencies.

==European approvals of biosimilars==

===BPCI Act===
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) was originally sponsored and introduced on June 26, 2007, by Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] (D-MA).  It was formally passed under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPAC Act), signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. The BPCI Act was an amendment to the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be highly similar (biosimilar) to a [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved biological product. The BPCI Act is similar, conceptually, to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (also referred to as the "Hatch-Waxman Act") which created biological drug approval through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&amp;C Act). The BPCI Act aligns with the FDA's longstanding policy of permitting appropriate reliance on what is already known about a drug, thereby saving time and resources and avoiding unnecessary duplication of human or animal testing. The FDA has released a total of four draft guidelines related to biosimilar or follow-on biologics development. Upon the release of the first three guidance documents the FDA held a public hearing on May 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=MS|last2=Ehrenpreis|first2=ED|last3=Kulkarni|first3=PM|last4=FDA-Related Matters Committee of the American College of|first4=Gastroenterology|title=Biosimilars: the need, the challenge, the future: the FDA perspective.|journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology|date=December 2014|volume=109|issue=12|pages=1856–9|pmid=24957160|url=http://gi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FDA_Biosimilars_December_2014.pdf|doi=10.1038/ajg.2014.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data exclusivity ===
[[Data exclusivity]] is an important piece of the amendment in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for biosimilars. It is the period of time between FDA approval and an abbreviated filing for a biosimilar on the original producer's data. Data exclusivity is designed to preserve innovation and recognize the long, costly, and risky process involved while the innovator waits to gain FDA approval. The time allowed for data exclusivity is critical for the future of biologics. A number of provisions for data exclusivity in recent legislative proposals ranged up to 14 years, however, the passing of the PPAC Act guarantees a 12-year time period from the time of FDA approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/262|title=42 U.S. Code § 262 - Regulation of biological products|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supposed to compensate for perceived shortcomings in patent protection for biologics. Data exclusivity extends from the date of product approval, and this protection period runs concurrently with any remaining patent term protection for the biologic. That is to say, data exclusivity provides additional protection to the innovator when the remaining patent length is shorter than the data exclusivity period at the time of approval (which can occur due to lengthy pre-clinical and clinical research required to obtain FDA approval), or to the extent that the patent term is circumvented by a biosimilar prior to its expiry.

=== Nomenclature ===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the FDA have been working for years on the [[drug nomenclature#Nonproprietary names|nonproprietary naming]] of biosimilars. In August 2015, the FDA published a draft guideline on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Naming and Biological Products {{!}} FDA Voice|url = http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2015/08/naming-and-biological-products|website = blogs.fda.gov|accessdate = 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In brief, the guideline calls for the assignment of a four character alphabetic suffix to the nonproprietary name of the original product to distinguish between innovator drugs and their biosimilars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Federal Register {{!}} Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability|url = https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/08/28/2015-21383/nonproprietary-naming-of-biological-products-draft-guidance-for-industry-availability|website = www.federalregister.gov|accessdate = 2015-08-29|date = 2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO INN system calls this suffix a biologic modifier.&lt;ref name="who_inn_bio"&gt;{{Citation |author=World Health Organization |authorlink=World Health Organization |title=INN and Biologicals |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/services/inn/inn_bio/en/ |accessdate=2016-08-05 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market implications ==
[[File:Biosimilars Patent Cliff.png|thumb|The 2012–2019 [[patent cliff]].&lt;ref name=biosimilars /&gt; Period of market exclusivity up to date of patent expiration for the ten top-selling biologics for 2011. *Enbrel has been granted approval in 2011 for a patent filed in 1995, extending its patent life further 17 years.]]
The legal requirements of approval pathways, together with the costly manufacturing processes, escalates the developing costs for biosimilars that could be between $75–$250 million per molecule.&lt;ref name=biosimilars&gt;{{cite journal | author = Calo-Fernández B, Martínez-Hurtado J | title = Biosimilars: Company Strategies to Capture Value from the Biologics Market | journal = Pharmaceuticals |date=December 2012 | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 1393–1408 | doi = 10.3390/ph5121393 | pmid=24281342 | pmc=3816668}}&lt;/ref&gt; This market entry barrier affects not only the companies willing to produce them but could also delay availability of inexpensive alternatives for public healthcare institutions that subsidize treatment for their patients. Even though the biosimilars market is rising, the price drop for biological drugs at risk of patent expiration will not be as great as for other generic drugs; in fact it has been estimated that the price for biosimilar products will be 65%-85% of their originators.&lt;ref name=biosimilars /&gt; Biosimilars are drawing market's attention since there is an upcoming [[patent cliff]], which will put nearly 36% of the $140 billion market for biologic drugs at risk (as of 2011), this considering only the top 10 selling products.&lt;ref name=biosimilars /&gt;

The global biosimilars market was $1.3 billion in 2013 and is expected to reach $35 billion by 2020 driven by the patent expiration of additional ten blockbuster biologic drugs.&lt;ref name="urlBiosimilars and Follow-on-Biologics Market to Hit $35 Billion Globally by 2020 | Pharmaceutical Technology"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pharmtech.com/biosimilars-and-follow-biologics-market-hit-35-billion-globally-2020 | title = Biosimilars and Follow-on-Biologics Market to Hit $35 Billion Globally by 2020 | work = Pharmaceutical Technology | date = 28 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is open to anyone with an interest in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About us - join |url=http://bsdb.org/about-us/ |publisher=British Society for Developmental Biology |accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The British Society for Developmental Biology was founded in 1948 as the London Embryologists’
Club. In 1964 it was expanded from a club into a scientific society named the Society for Developmental Biology. However in 1964 the [[Society for Developmental Biology|Society for the Study of Growth and Development]] in the United States had also voted to change to the same name, and in 1966 took over sponsorship of the journal [[Developmental Biology]]. In 1969 the smaller British society changed to its current name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Slack |first=Jonathan M. W. |title=A short history of the British Society for Developmental Biology |url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/descarga/paper/10761851 |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |year=2003 |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=79-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
{{further|Waddington Medal}}

The society administers four annual awards and a studentship. The [[Waddington Medal]], dating from 1998, is awarded tor "an outstanding individual who has made major contributions to any aspect of Developmental Biology in the UK".&lt;ref name=Awards&gt;{{cite web |title=Awards |url=http://bsdb.org/category/awards/ |publisher=British Society for Developmental Biology |accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the society added the Cheryll Tickle Medal to be awarded to a mid-career female scientist. It is named for the embryologist [[Cheryll Tickle]], the first winner of the Waddington Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cheryll Tickle Medal |url=http://bsdb.org/awards/the-cheryll-tickle-medal/ |publisher=British Society for Developmental Biology |accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 2016 Abigail Saffron Tucker 
* 2017 Jenny Nichols

The society also has awards for early career scientists. The Beddington Medal is awarded for the "best PhD thesis in developmental biology", the Dennis Summerhill Lecture Award for a junior researcher, and summer studentships for undergraduate studentships.&lt;ref name=Awards /&gt;

Holmes, sparked widespread political debate and public horror.

The lynchings were carried out by a mob of San Jose citizens in St. James Park across from the Santa Clara County Jail, and were broadcast as a 'live' event by a Los Angeles radio station.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell (1992). p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The killings of the suspects were tacitly endorsed by the governor of California.  Scores of reporters, photographers, and newsreel camera operators, along with an estimated 3,000 to 10,000 men, women, and children, were witness to it. When newspapers published photos, identifiable faces were deliberately smudged so that they remained anonymous; the following Monday, local newspapers published 1.2 million copies, twice the normal daily production.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell (1992). p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2007). p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harts Department Store, San Jose, California 1926.jpeg|thumb|Harts Department Store, San Jose, California 1926]]

==Background==
In 1933 Brooke Hart was 22 years old, and the heir to one of San Jose's best-known businesses.  His grandfather, Leopold Hart, was an Alsatian immigrant who bought an mercantile shop known as the Cash Corner store in San Jose in 1866.  After Leopold's son, Alex J. Hart Sr. (known as A.J.) took over the business, it expanded to the landmark status it held in San Jose for four decades - becoming as much a part of the fabric of the city as [[Macy's]] was in New York or [[Neiman Marcus]] was in Dallas.

The Hart store was famous for its attentive customer service, and benefited from the deep loyalty of customers and employees alike.  When the country found itself in the grip of [[The Great Depression]], Hart's held onto its central place in the lives of San Jose's citizens, and continued to buy advertising in local publications.&lt;ref&gt;"Herhold: Remembering old downtown San Jose’s signature department store", ''San Jose Mercury News'', December 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The family was one of the city's most prominent, and their influence was the source of many colorful stories: one such tale recounts that the artist who repainted the ceiling of St. Joseph Cathedral in the 1920s modeled the cherubs in his work on the Hart family's children.

Brooke Hart had worked in his family's [[department store]] during much of his youth and was well-known and liked by the local community. After he graduated from [[Santa Clara University]], his father, A.J., made him a junior vice president&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leonardoricardosanto.blogspot.com/2010/08/alex-hart-he-was-philanthropist.html |title=ALEX HART: "He was a philanthropist, a businessman, a civic and community leader, a social arbiter, a charming host, a gentleman and a friend... |author=Santo, Leonardo Ricardo |date=31 August 2010 |website=Blogspot [blog] |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the store and began grooming him to take over when A.J. retired.

==Disappearance==
Just before 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Thursday, November&amp;nbsp;9, 1933,&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2007). p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooke Hart retrieved his 1933 [[Studebaker]] [[Studebaker President|President roadster]], a graduation present from his parents, from a downtown [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] parking lot behind the family store.  He had agreed to chauffeur his father, A.J., who did not drive, to a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce at the San Jose Country Club.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell (1992). p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Brooke did not turn up to collect his father, A.J. became concerned.  Hours passed and still there was no sign of Brooke.  The family anxiety grew; the eldest Hart child was responsible and punctual.  This disappearance was entirely out of character.

===Ransom demands===
At 9:30 that night, Aleese Hart, the older of Hart's two younger sisters, answered the telephone at the family home and was informed by a "soft-spoken man" that Hart had been kidnapped and that instructions for his return would be provided later.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell (1992). p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; At 10:30, what sounded like the same man called and informed the other sister, Miriam, that her brother would be returned upon payment of {{US$|40000|1933|round=-3}}. Delivery instructions would be provided the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell (1992). pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The San Jose Police, the [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] [[Sheriff]]s office, and the U.S. Division of Investigation (the forerunner of the [[FBI]]) were quickly brought into the case. The phone calls were traced to locations in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;Farrell (1992). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Hart's wallet had already been discovered in San Francisco on the guard rail of a tanker which had been refueling the [[Matson Lines]] passenger liner [[SS Lurline (1932)|SS ''Lurline'']], and it was assumed the wallet had been tossed from a porthole on the liner.&lt;ref name="BDG-19331111" /&gt; ''Lurline'' was stopped and searched in [[Los Angeles]] upon arrival&lt;!--It is not clear from the primary source or the linked article on ''Lurline'' that ''Lurline'' was shuttling between Los Angeles and San Francisco daily. It is more likely that Lurline was plying a San Francisco - Los Angeles - Honolulu route, but there is no definitive answer.--&gt; on November&amp;nbsp;11, but nothing was found.&lt;ref name="BDG-19331111" /&gt; Police then advanced an alternative theory: since Pier 32, from which ''Lurline'' had departed, was close to the sewer outfall, the heavily laden tanker may have dipped below the surface and picked up the wallet from where it had been discharged from the sewer, lifting it from the bay once a sufficient amount of fuel had been offloaded.&lt;ref name="BDG-19331111"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uBsiAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1264%2C940199 |title=Fatal Shooting Marks Dispute Over Kidnapping |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=11 November 1933 |newspaper=Berkeley Daily Gazette |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the passengers detained during the three-hour search was [[Babe Ruth]], traveling to Los Angeles to watch a football game between [[University of Southern California|Southern California]] and [[Leland Stanford Junior University|Stanford]].&lt;ref name="BDG-19331111" /&gt;

A "compromise ransom" telegram from Sacramento arrived on November&amp;nbsp;12, suggesting that {{US$|20000|1933|round=-3}} would be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u99XAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4039%2C2266700 |title=Kidnapers lower ransom demands |agency=AP |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=13 November 1933 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=HT19331113.2.21 |title=Compromise is suggested for ransom |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=United Press |date=13 November 1933 |newspaper=Healdsburg Tribune |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the family was not contacted again until Monday, November&amp;nbsp;13, when a letter, postmarked in Sacramento, arrived in the mail at the family department store.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell (1992). p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; It instructed Hart's father, A.J. Hart, to have a radio installed in the Studebaker (which already had a radio), because the ransom instructions would be broadcast over [[NBC]] radio station [[KNBR|KPO]].&lt;ref&gt;Farrell (1992). p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnapper also instructed A.J. Hart to be ready to drive the Studebaker to deliver the ransom, but A.J. Hart had never learned to drive.

On Tuesday, a second ransom note arrived, this time postmarked in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2007). p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; It instructed A.J. Hart to place the ransom in a black satchel and drive to [[Los Angeles]]. That night, Hart took a call from a man claiming to be his son's kidnapper who instructed him to take the night train to Los Angeles. The authorities staked out the train station and mistakenly arrested a bank teller out for an evening stroll. The next day, a sign was placed in a window of the Hart store stating that A.J. Hart did not drive. A call was received that night again demanding that Hart drive to deliver the ransom. Hart demanded proof that his son was with the caller. The caller stated that Brooke Hart was being held at a safe location. Because a phone tap had been placed on the Hart telephone, the call was traced to a garage in downtown San Jose, but the caller was gone by the time the authorities arrived.

===Arrests and confessions===
Another ransom demand arrived the following day, again ordering A.J. Hart to drive with the ransom. That night, another call was received and the demand that Hart drive was repeated. The sheriff arrested Thomas Harold Thurmond near a pay phone in a parking garage {{convert|150|ft}} from the San Jose Police station at about 8 p.m.&lt;ref name="HT-19331117" /&gt; At 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., Thurmond, after hours of questioning, signed a confession in which he claimed to have bound Brooke Hart's hands with wire and tossed him off the San Mateo Bridge into San Francisco Bay sometime between 7:00 and 7:30 on the night of the kidnapping.&lt;ref name="HT-19331117" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MT-19331117" /&gt; And he identified an accomplice: John Holmes, a recently unemployed salesman who was separated from his wife and two children,.&lt;ref name="MT-19331117" /&gt; Holmes was arrested in his [[Single room occupancy|SRO]] room at the California Hotel near the San Jose Police station at 3:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="HT-19331117" /&gt; According to Thurmond's confession, Holmes approached him with the scheme six weeks prior, after he had separated from his family.&lt;ref name="MT-19331117" /&gt;

At 1 p.m. on November&amp;nbsp;17, Holmes signed a confession admitting that he and Thurmond kidnapped Hart and threw him into [[San Francisco Bay]]. Later, the Santa Clara County District Attorney advised the press that, unless corroborated by independent evidence of the crime, confessions by Thurmond and Holmes in which each blamed the other for the crime were not admissible in a court of law.

According to the men's confessions, when Hart stopped his car near the exit of the parking lot, Thurmond slipped into the passenger seat and, holding a gun on him, forced Hart to drive to what is now [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], about seven miles north of San Jose.&lt;ref name="Adams-207"&gt;Adams (2005). p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; There they abandoned the Studebaker for another waiting car, which had been driven to the rendezvous point by Holmes, and the group of three drove to the [[San Mateo Bridge]].&lt;ref name="Adams-207" /&gt;

On the bridge, the men ordered Hart out of the car, and one of the kidnappers struck him twice on the head from behind with a concrete block until he was unconscious.&lt;ref name="HT-19331117"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=HT19331117.2.19 |title=Hart's body filled with bullets |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=Tribune Service |date=17 November 1933 |newspaper=Healdsburg Tribune |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then bound his arms with baling wire before dumping him into San Francisco Bay.&lt;ref name="HT-19331117" /&gt; The tide was out and there were only a few feet of water at the base of the bridge; the kidnappers then shot Hart, killing him.&lt;ref name="Adams-207" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HT-19331117" /&gt; A few hours later, they placed the first telephone call to the Hart family demanding $40,000 for Hart's return.

Local newspapers reported that Holmes and Thurmond had met with psychiatrists and would attempt to plead [[not guilty by reason of insanity]]. Thurmond claimed he had been "crazy" for more than a year, since his sweetheart married another man,&lt;ref name="MT-19331117" /&gt; and Holmes planned to repudiate his confession, which his attorney claimed had been "forced from him by third-degree methods,"&lt;ref name="MT-19331121" /&gt; including threats to "turn him over to the mob for lynching if he did not confess."&lt;ref name="MT-19331128" /&gt; Upon learning of rumors of a possible insanity plea on the part of Thurmond, law enforcement authorities directed two psychiatrists from [[Agnews Developmental Center|Agnews State Mental Hospital]] in Santa Clara, California to examine the two men to preclude such a defense. Following cursory examinations in their cells at the Santa Clara County jail in San Jose, with a mob outside in the jail courtyard, both men were declared sane.&lt;ref name="MT-19331125"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19331125.2.3 |title=Recovery Body Hart To Cause Trouble Is Fear of Authorities |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=25 November 1933 |agency=UP |newspaper=Madera Tribune |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search for the body===
Police officers from Santa Clara, [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo]], and [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]] Counties began searching the bay around the bridge, hoping to find Hart's body. Trace evidence, including stains on the bridge, "blonde hair on a brick" and other markings convinced authorities the confessors had truthfully described the sequence of events, including dumping Hart.&lt;ref name="MT-19331123" /&gt;

The first physical clues were unearthed on November&amp;nbsp;18.

==Lynching of Thurmond and Holmes==
===Warning signs===
Because of lynch threats, Santa Clara County Sheriff Emig moved Thurmond and Holmes to the Potrero Hill police station in San Francisco for safekeeping soon after their arrest.&lt;ref name="HT-19331117" /&gt; A San Jose newspaper ran a front-page editorial branding Holmes and Thurmond "human devils" and called for "mob violence."&lt;ref name="MT-19331117"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19331117.2.18 |title=Lynching kidnapers threat |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=UP |date=17 November 1933 |newspaper=Madera Tribune |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their return to the San Francisco jail from questioning, cries of "lynch them" were heard from the crowd surrounding that jail.&lt;ref name="HT-19331118" /&gt; On November&amp;nbsp;21, Holmes and Thurmond remained in the jail, and fear of vigilantism led authorities to announce they would be held "indefinitely." Reportedly, "20 influential friends of the socially prominent Hart family" had formed a committee to "insist on immediate and drastic punishment for the prisoners." Prosecutors declined to seek grand jury hearings in the fear that an indictment would incite vigilantes.&lt;ref name="MT-19331121"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19331121.2.16 |title=Fear lynching San Jose kidnapers |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=UP |date=21 November 1933 |newspaper=Madera Tribune |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these fears, the pair were indicted on charges of extortion, using the mails for extortion, and conspiracy, and were returned to the San Jose jail the night of November&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;ref name="MT-19331123"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19331123.2.15 |title=Slayers Return to San Jose Jail—Body Seen Floating |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=UP |date=23 November 1933 |newspaper=Madera Tribune |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November&amp;nbsp;23, [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[James Rolph]] announced to shocked reporters that he would refuse to dispatch the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] to protect Thurmond and Holmes.&lt;ref name="MT-19331123" /&gt;

Upon payment of $10,000 cash—an astonishing sum in 1933—by the father of Jack Holmes, San Francisco attorney [[Vincent Hallinan]] agreed to represent his son. Thurmond was defended by J.

Rolph retorted that he would "pardon the lynchers".

===Overnight lynching 26–27 November===
Authorities "expected trouble if and when the missing body was found."&lt;ref name="MT-19331125" /&gt; After the discovery of Hart's body on Sunday, November&amp;nbsp;26, word went out immediately throughout northern California. All day Sunday and into the evening, radio stations issued inflammatory announcements that a lynching would occur that night in St. James Park in San Jose.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2005). p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; By 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., a mob estimated by the press to range anywhere from 5,000 to 15,000 men, women, and children were jammed into the park, with an estimated 3,000 vehicles left on streets nearby. Governor James Rolph was in regular telephonic communication with Raymond Cato, whom he had appointed to head the California Highway Patrol. Cato was ensconced in the home of a Rolph political ally and neighbor in the mountains west of San Jose with an open phone line to the jail.&lt;ref name="Farrell-215" /&gt; Although the crowd was characterized as "good natured" earlier in the day, periodically there was an ominous chanting of "Eleven o'clock!".&lt;ref name="Brier-19331127"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Chronicle-Covers-A-San-Jose-lynching-that-s-10629127.php |title=Kidnapers Lynched! |author=Brier, Royce |date=27 November 1933 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=1 December 2016 |quote='''Mob Storms Jail, Hangs Slayers in San Jose Square'''—'''Avengers of Hart Defy Tear Gas Bombs to Drag Thurmond and Holmes From Cells to Death'''&lt;br/&gt;{{pad|1.0em}}SAN JOSE, Nov. 26—Lynch law wrote the last grim chapter in the Brooke Hart kidnaping here tonight.&lt;br/&gt;{{pad|1.0em}}Twelve hours after the mutilated body of the son of Alex J.

At approximately 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Rolph canceled a planned trip to the Western Governors' Conference in Boise, Idaho,&lt;ref name="MT-19331127" /&gt; to prevent his chief political rival, Lieutenant Governor [[Frank Merriam]], from calling out the National Guard to stop the lynchings.&lt;ref name="Farrell-215"&gt;Farrell (1992). p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=INUrAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5428%2C4907032 |title=Hanging Gets Gov.

===Immediate aftermath===
Thurmond was buried in an unmarked plot in [[Oak Hill Memorial Park]] on November&amp;nbsp;29, the same cemetery where Brooke Hart had been buried on November&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;ref name="MT-19331129" /&gt;  Holmes was cremated at Oak Hill on November&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref name="MT-19331129"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19331129.2.4 |title=Stories of Youths They Led Lynching Party to Be Probed |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=29 November 1933 |agency=UP |newspaper=Madera Tribune |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', on December 2, after a special meeting of the city council heard testimony in support of leaving the tree as a monument and warning to evildoers, the council approved the cutting down of the cork elm by city workers. Police were required to keep off a crowd of souvenir hunters seeking a twig or branch of the infamous "gallows tree", the bark and lower branches having been hacked and stripped for mementos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=INUrAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2511%2C4907051 |title=Parents hold to innocence of son |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=AP |date=27 November 1933 |newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of the case==
The lynching was unique in American political and criminal justice history because it marked the first time that a lynching was a media event. It was also unique because of the political involvement of a state governor and the eagerness by civic and business leaders and law enforcement to allow the lynching of two men who had not been indicted, arraigned, tried, or sentenced for the crime in a court of law. Many modern historians conclude that the two men were indeed guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Kulczyk (2007). p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Royce Brier]], a staff writer for the ''Chronicle'', would later go on to win the [[1934 Pulitzer Prize]] [[Pulitzer Prize for Reporting|for Reporting]] for his account of the lynching. According to the prize citation, Brier worked for 16 hours along with several assistants mingling with the lynch mob and telephoning running updates from a garage across the street from the jail before composing the story in three hours starting at 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on the morning of November&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norcalmediamuseum.org/?page_id=266 |title=Royce Brier |date=7 May 1934 |publisher=Media Museum of Northern California |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prosecution of lynch mob===
Governor Rolph praised the action, stating that California had sent a message to future kidnappers, and promised to [[pardon]] anyone involved in the lynching.&lt;ref name="MT-19331127" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=HTES19331130.2.47 |title=No arrests Rolph says |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 November 1933 |newspaper=Healdsburg Tribune, Enterprise and Scimitar |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rolph died on June 2, 1934, before any charges had been filed in the case.

Alameda County [[District Attorney]] [[Earl Warren]] was the strongest supporter of prosecution for the lynching. Santa Clara County Assistant District Attorney Herbert Bridges was quoted as saying he was "not sorry [the lynching] happened in San Jose."&lt;ref name="MT-19331128" /&gt; Santa Clara County District Attorney Fred Thomas doubted anyone could be found to bear witness against the leaders of the lynching, characterizing the stories being told by local youths as "boastful" but uncorroborated.&lt;ref name="MT-19331129" /&gt; The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] stated they had found eyewitnesses ready to identify members of the lynch mob by December 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19331212.2.5 |title=Demand trials San Jose mob |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=12 December 1933 |newspaper=Madera Tribune |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but San Jose citizens were outspoken in their opposition to "outsider" interference.&lt;ref name="HT-19331214"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=HT19331214.2.13 |title=Dislike of 'outsiders' expressed |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=United Press |date=14 December 1933 |newspaper=Healdsburg Tribune |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually seven people were arrested for the lynchings, but none were convicted. California did not specifically define lynching as a crime, although crimes committed during the lynching such as rioting, assault, and murder could potentially be prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19331127.2.45 |title=California Has No Anti-lynching Law |author= |date=27 November 1933 |newspaper=Madera Tribune |accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One young man was charged for participating in the lynching after he publicly claimed credit for leading the mob,&lt;ref name="HT-19331214" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19331215.2.5 |title=Lynch leader hearing set |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=UP |date=15 December 1933 |newspaper=Madera Tribune |accessdate=29 November 2016 |quote=Eighteen year-old Anthony Cataldi who boasted he led the mob that lynched Jack Holmes and Thomas Thurmond, kidnap killers of Brooke Hart, was arraigned today on a charge of participating in the hangings and preliminary hearing was set for 2 p. m. next Wednesday. The boy’s arrest was brought about by the American Civil Liberties Union which, as a part of its nationwide campaign against lynchings, interested itself in prosecution of the San Jose hangers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the charges were dropped. The Santa Clara County Grand Jury met the following year, but despite literally thousands of witnesses, scores of reporters, and hundreds of photographs, the grand jury found that no witnesses could identify anyone from the lynching, so no charges were filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1934/01/19/page/12/article/grand-jury-fails-to-indict-san-jose-lynching-suspects#text |title=Grand jury fails to indict San Jose lynching suspects |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=19 January 1934 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |agency=UP |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SBS19340118.1.1 |title=San Jose Jurors Fail to Indict Lynch Suspects |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=18 January 1934 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=San Bernardino Sun |accessdate=30 November 2016 |quote=Resolved that the testimony submitted to this grand jury to date is totally inadequate to justify the bringing of an indictment against any person or persons for participation in the lynching of John M. Holmes and Harold Thurmond, and we have therefore failed to bring an indictment against anyone.

===Public criticism===
In the aftermath of the lynching, Governor Rolph was publicly condemned for advocating "lynch law" by former President [[Herbert Hoover]], then at [[Stanford University]] in [[Palo Alto, California]]. Rolph replied, "If troops had been called out, hundreds of innocent citizens might have been mowed down."&lt;ref name="Logan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/logan-herald-journal-dec-01-1933-p-1/|title=Logan Herald Journal Newspaper Archives, Dec 1, 1933|date=1933-12-01|page=1|work=NewspaperArchive.com|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolph accused Hoover of calling out the U.S. Army against the veterans of [[World War I]] "[[Bonus Army|Bonus Marchers]]" in Washington, D.C. in 1932. The exchange continued.&lt;ref name="Logan" /&gt; President Roosevelt also condemned the lynching.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Civil suits===
Holmes's parents sued Governor Rolph for his role in the lynching of their son,&lt;ref name="MT-19331128"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19331128.2.18 |title=Answer to Kidnaping Racket Says Official Claim Slayer Insane |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=UP |date=28 November 1933 |newspaper=Madera Tribune |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MT-19331129" /&gt; along with [[KCBS (AM)|radio station KQW]] and several other persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=HT19340420.2.12 |title=Action is Brought by Widow and Children Of Brooke Hart Killer |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=20 April 1934 |newspaper=Healdsburg Tribune |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the suit was dropped when the governor died of a heart attack in 1934. Holmes's widow sued Sheriff Emig and several deputies, citing their carelessness and negligence in failing to protect him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=HT19341127.2.22 |title=Holmes widow sues sheriff |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 November 1934 |newspaper=Healdsburg Tribune |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond's family took no action on his behalf and reportedly never again spoke about the matter amongst themselves.

==Family==
Hart had three sisters, Jeanette, Miriam, and Aleese, and a brother, Alexander Joseph Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/mercurynews/obituary.aspx?pid=144816394 |title=Obituary of Alexander Joseph Hart Jr. |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2010 |publisher=Mercury News |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern coverage==
In 1983, Harry Farrell, a columnist for the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', wrote about the lynching in a two-part series.&lt;ref name=Szymanski&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sjsunews.com/spartan_daily/daily_epitaph/afterobits/article_0d957af8-e910-11e4-9f3f-0bf7c8e09330.html |title=Harry Farrell |author=Szymanski, Kyle |date=22 April 2015 |newspaper=Spartan Daily |accessdate=29 November 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mNrNssCg?url=http://www.sjsunews.com/spartan_daily/daily_epitaph/afterobits/article_0d957af8-e910-11e4-9f3f-0bf7c8e09330.html |archivedate=29 November 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he retired, he followed up with a book on the same subject, ''Swift Justice'', published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Swift Justice'' was praised by [[Walter Cronkite]] and won a [[Edgar Award]] in 1993, beating out the expected winner, [[Ann Rule]].&lt;ref name=Szymanski /&gt;

John Murphy criticized Farrell's approach, noting that by accepting the confessions as the baseline truth and hewing to the "conventional" history that led to mob justice, Farrell had invented conversations and created motivations that were impossible to corroborate and glossed over inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2007). pp. 5–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy points out the later phone calls placed to make ransom demands came from payphones physically close together, culminating in the arrest of Thurmond at a payphone only {{convert|150|ft}} from San Jose Police Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2007). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy would go on to write a book, ''Jury Rigging in the Court of Public Opinion'' (published in 2007),&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and write and produce a movie, ''Valley of the Hearts Delight'' regarding the 1933 case.&lt;ref name=MurphyShadows&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sanjose.com/2010/09/08/09_08_2010_shadows_of_doubt/ |title=Shadows of Doubt |author=Murphy, John D. |date=8 September 2010 |website=SanJose.com |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular media==
The lynching inspired local punk band Executioner to write the song "St. James Park".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube |id=zpjM3_VZqQs |title=St. James Park by Executioner San Jose Punk Band}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was not released until 2011, when one of the founders of Executioner, Dave Burks, gathered available recordings from the band's active years of 1982–83.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.punkglobe.com/daveburksinterview0810.html |title=And one more thing ... a conversation with Dave Burks |interviewer=Helwig, Kenny |editor=Gray, Robert |subject=Burks, Dave |date=August 2010 |website=Punk Globe |accessdate=30 November 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827180848/http://www.punkglobe.com/daveburksinterview0810.html |archivedate=27 August 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1933 lynching also inspired two short stories from [[John Steinbeck]]:
* "The Lonesome Vigilante" (1936).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://classic.esquire.com/the-lonesome-vigilante/ |title=The Lonesome Vigilante |author=Steinbeck, John |date=October 1936 |magazine=Esquire |pages=35 |accessdate=29 November 2016}}{{subreq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Facts behind John Steinbeck's 'The Lonesome Vigilante' |author=Delgado, James P. |journal=Steinbeck Quarterly |date=Summer–Fall 1983 |pages=70–79 |volume=16 |number=3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cerro Maravilla murders''', also known as the '''Cerro Maravilla massacre''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticel.com/noticia/100738/artistas-buscan-emular-a-campeche.html ''Artistas buscan emular a Campeche.''] Ely Acevedo Denis. ''Noticel''. February 4, 2011. Retrieved July 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; occurred on July 25, 1978, at [[Cerro Maravilla]], a mountain in [[Puerto Rico]], wherein two young Puerto Rican [[Independence movement in Puerto Rico|pro-independence activists]] were murdered in a [[Puerto Rico Police]] ambush. The event sparked a series of political controversies where, in the end, the police officers were found guilty of murder and several high-ranking local government officials were accused of planning and/or covering up the incident.

Originally declared a police intervention against [[terrorist]]s, the local media quickly questioned the officers' testimonies as well as the only surviving witness for inconsistencies. Although reluctant, [[Carlos Romero Barceló]] ([[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|PNP]]), then [[Governor of Puerto Rico]], ordered the local [[Puerto Rico Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to launch various investigations, and asked the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[US Justice Department]] to aid in the investigations, which concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the officers' part. However, after one of the local opposing political parties{{which|date=January 2018}} launched its own inquiries, new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers' part, as well as the possibility of a local and federal cover-up. Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes.

The incident and subsequent events have become one of the most controversial events in Puerto Rico's political history, frequently called "the worst political cover-up in the history of the island".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdfdocspace.com/download/doc/8150/shining-star.html ''Shining Star''] Pedro Alberto Vera.  2007. Page 77. Retrieved July 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The event is often used by Puerto Rican independence activists as an example of [[political oppression]] against the independence movement. Joy James commented that "the Cerro Maravilla massacre demonstrated the reason why colonialism was banned in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=csjtHiEJ7-MC&amp;pg=PA185 "Century of Colonialism"] ''Warfare in the American Homeland: Policing and Prison in a Penal Democracy: Policing and Prison in a Penal Democracy''.

==The victims==

'''Carlos Enrique Soto Arriví''' was born on December 8, 1959, in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. His parents were [[Pedro Juan Soto]] (one of the most admired Puerto Rican novelists in the 20th century) and Rosa Arriví. He had an older brother (Roberto Alfonso) and a younger brother (Juan Manuel).&lt;ref name="Carlos Soto Arriví"&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/50091579 Carlos Soto Arriví] on [[Find A Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a student he enjoyed [[literature]]. He also wrote stories and went on to win second place in a competition held by the Puerto Rico Department of Education. When his parents went to Europe to finish their doctoral studies, he learned to speak [[French language|French]] in a year. Upon returning from [[Europe]], he enrolled at the Escuela Superior República de Colombia, a [[high school]] in [[Río Piedras]], although in a lower grade, because the school officials did not want to credit his years of overseas study.  Although Soto Arriví was interested in social issues from a very young age, his political activism started when he joined a [[Independence movement in Puerto Rico|pro-independence]] group in [[high school]].&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916768,00.html ''Nation: Death at Cerro Maravilla''] from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' May 14, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arnaldo Darío Rosado.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|Arnaldo Darío Rosado]]
'''Arnaldo Darío Rosado Torres''' was born on November 23, 1953, in [[Old San Juan]]. His parents were Pablo Rosado and Juana Torres Aymat. Rosado finished his high school studies and went to work at a cracker [[factory]]. Dario Rosado was married to Angela Rivera, and had a son called Manuel Lenín Rosado Rivera.&lt;ref name="Carlos Soto Arriví"/&gt;

From a very young age, Rosado identified with the cause of Puerto Rico's independence. He joined the [[socialist]] league with which he participated in several activities. Rosado was an [[autodidact]] and an avid reader of various kinds of [[literature]], especially those related to the political processes of Puerto Rico and [[Latin America]]. He also wrote [[poems]], [[essays]], and had several [[pen-pal]]s throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

==The incident==
[[File:Cerro Maravilla Incident Memorial Stone.JPG|thumb|240px|Cerro Maravilla Incident Memorial Stone, near top of [[Cerro Maravilla]]]]
On the night of July 25, 1978, Carlos Soto Arriví and Arnaldo Darío Rosado, two independence activists of the Armed Revolutionary Movement ({{lang-es|Movimiento Revolucionario Armado|links=no}}), along with undercover police officer [[Alejandro González Malavé]] posing as a fellow group member, took taxi driver Julio Ortiz Molina hostage and ordered him to drive them to Cerro Maravilla where several communication towers were located. Their original plan was to set fire and sabotage the towers to protest the imprisonment of [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party|Puerto Rican nationalists]] convicted of the [[Truman assassination attempt|1950 assassination attempt]] on U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] and the [[U.S. Capitol shooting incident (1954)|1954 shooting]] at the [[United States Capitol]] where five members of Congress were injured.&lt;ref name="Acquitted"&gt;[http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m12.html "Ex-agent Acquitted of Kidnapping in Puerto Rico"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430130413/http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m12.html |date=April 30, 2006 }}, ''The New York Times'', February 22, 1986, retrieved August 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; State police officers were alerted of their plan prior to their arrival and the activists were ambushed and shot.&lt;ref name="Romero"&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n38/RomeroMistake-en.html "Romero: Mistake To Call Police 'Heroes' In Cerro Maravilla"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212080215/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n38/RomeroMistake-en.html |date=February 12, 2008 }} by Laura Rivera Melendez (AP) ''The Puerto Rico Herald'', September 15, 2003, retrieved August 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Romero Hurt"&gt;[http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m10.html "Puerto Rican Governor Seen as Hurt by Officers' Arrest"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430130445/http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m10.html |date=April 30, 2006 }}, ''The New York Times'', October 21, 1984, retrieved August 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Senator Inquiry"&gt;[http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m1.html "Senators Asked to Study Puerto Rico Killing Inquiry"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430130418/http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m1.html |date=April 30, 2006 }}, ''The New York Times'', August 11, 1980, retrieved August 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The undercover agent received a minor bullet wound during the shooting, while the taxi driver was left relatively unharmed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Initial statements===
The morning after the shootings, the officers argued that they acted in [[right of self-defense|self defense]], stating that they ordered the activists to surrender, at which time the activists started shooting at them and they returned fire. Initially, the taxi driver said he was under the dashboard of his cab when the shooting started and could not see who shot first,&lt;ref name="Senator Inquiry"/&gt; although he contradicted his statement a few days later in an interview with the ''[[San Juan Star]]'', a local newspaper, stating that he ducked under the dashboard of the car after the three men (the two activists and the undercover agent) left the car, and that he saw "10 heavily armed men" approaching. When he emerged from the car, he saw the three men alive and two of them were being beaten by the armed men, who were later identified as policemen.&lt;ref name="Romero Hurt"/&gt; Then-Governor of Puerto Rico [[Carlos Romero Barceló]] ([[Partido Nuevo Progresista|PNP]]) praised the officers in a televised address by calling them “heroic”, stating that they acted in self-defense and stopped a terrorist attack.&lt;ref name="Romero Hurt"/&gt;

Two days later, in a follow-up interview by [[WAPA-TV]] news reporter Enrique Cruz, the taxi driver stated that when the first shooting occurred, he heard one of his three passengers shout "I'm an agent! Don't shoot me, I'm an agent!" while the others called for help and shouted "I give up! I give up!".&lt;ref name="WAPA"&gt;{{YouTube|gqqFO0LPOZU|Television interview}} (in Spanish) of Julio Ortiz Molina by [[WAPA-TV]] on July 27, 1978 (YouTube clip)&lt;/ref&gt; He saw "10 heavily armed men" approaching, later identified as police agents,&lt;ref name="Romero Hurt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WAPA"/&gt; when the three passengers exited the car, and the taxi driver was ordered at gunpoint to exit the vehicle.&lt;ref name="WAPA"/&gt; He was extracted by an agent, kicked,&lt;ref name="WAPA"/&gt; and taken away from the scene.&lt;ref name="Romero Hurt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WAPA"/&gt; While being escorted, he saw the two activists directly in front of his vehicle being beaten by the armed men.&lt;ref name="Romero Hurt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WAPA"/&gt;

===The first investigations===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Foto de Carlos Soto Arriví y Arnaldo Darío Rosado.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Carlos Soto Arriví (''left''),18, and Arnaldo Darío Rosado (''right''), 24, the two murdered victims]] --&gt;
Facing public pressure due to the taxi driver's conflicting statements, Governor Romero Barceló ordered two separate investigations by the P.R. Justice Department in addition to the ongoing standard Police investigation, all of which concluded that the officers' actions were free of any wrongdoing, despite various inconsistencies in their stories.&lt;ref name="Romero Hurt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Senator Inquiry"/&gt; P.R. District Attorney Pedro Colton informed reporters on July 29, four days after the incident, that the P.R. Justice Department's investigation revealed "no massacre, no beatings, and no aggressions, except for the shootings that occurred in Cerro Maravilla".&lt;ref name="WAPA"/&gt; Opposing political parties, mainly the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico|Popular Democratic Party]] (PPD), insisted that the investigations were just cover-ups and demanded that a [[Puerto Rico Special Independent Prosecutor|special independent prosecutor]] be assigned to investigate.&lt;ref name="Romero Hurt"/&gt; Two special investigations by the [[US Justice Department|U.S. Justice Department's]] Civil Rights Division and by the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) were performed on separate occasions between 1978 and 1980, which confirmed the conclusions of the P.R. Justice Department that the officers acted in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Acquitted"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;[http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m15.html "Ex-Justice Official Cites 'Coverup' By FBI in '78 Puerto Rico Shootings"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430130457/http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m15.html |date=April 30, 2006 }} by Jim McGee, ''The Washington Post'', May 9, 1992, retrieved August 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===The second investigations===
In the November 1980 [[Elections in Puerto Rico|general elections]], Governor Romero Barceló was re-elected by a margin of 3,503 votes (one of the closest in Puerto Rico history),&lt;ref name="The Endless Elections"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922256-1,00.html |title=The Endless Elections |accessdate=December 15, 2007 |author= |date=December 29, 1980 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his party lost control of the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico|state legislature]] to the main opposition party, the PPD. This loss was attributed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to the surrounding controversy regarding the investigations at the time.&lt;ref name="Acquitted"/&gt; Other news organizations, such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', attributed the loss to Gov. Romero Barcelo's stance on the island's political status.&lt;ref name="The Endless Elections"/&gt; The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident. The Senate, then presided by Miguel Hernández Agosto, spearheaded the investigations by naming former Assistant [[District Attorney]] Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate.&lt;ref name="Acquitted"/&gt;

The second investigations performed between 1981 and 1984 by the legislature, the U.S. Justice Department, and the local press uncovered a plot to assassinate the activists and a possible, though not conclusive, conspiracy to cover-up these actions. During interviews of the Senate Investigations Committee in 1983, officer Miguel Cartagena Flores, a detective in the Intelligence Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department, testified: “When I arrived at the scene I saw 4 police officers aiming their guns at the two activists who were kneeling before them. I turned my eyes away and heard 5 gunshots."&lt;ref name="Kneeling activists"&gt;[http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m4.html "Puerto Ricans Were Kneeling When Killed By Police, Officer Says"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430130439/http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m4.html |date=April 30, 2006 }}, ''The New York Times'', November 30, 1983, retrieved August 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Cartagena, who was offered [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]] for his testimony, added that several hours before the shooting, he and other officers were told by Col. Angel Perez Casillas, commander of the Intelligence Division, that “these [[terrorist]]s should not come down (from the mountain) alive.”&lt;ref name="Kneeling activists"/&gt; His testimony was corroborated by officer Carmelo Cruz who, although he did not witness the fatal shooting, confirmed many details provided by Cartagena when also granted immunity.&lt;ref name="Kneeling activists"/&gt;

Other inquiries obtained similar testimony from witnesses, including the taxi driver who now stated that the activists were “alive and disarmed” when the police removed him from the scene.&lt;ref name="Acquitted"/&gt; The taxi driver stated that there was a short exchange of gunfire, and when he was removed to another place nearby he heard a second volley of gunfire,&lt;ref name="Senator Inquiry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots.&lt;ref name="Senator Inquiry"/&gt; The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex-officer Jesus Quiñones before a Federal [[grand jury]] (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a ''San Juan Star'' interview.&lt;ref name="Senator Inquiry"/&gt;

Subsequently, the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico|legislature]] and local press started questioning the actions of the [[Puerto Rico Police]], the [[Puerto Rico Department of Justice|Puerto Rico Justice Department]], the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]], and the [[FBI]] actions during the first investigation, alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover-up evidence. Letters were sent by various community and political leaders to then [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] chairman Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]], asking for an inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations.&lt;ref name="Senator Inquiry"/&gt; Several letters even accused former [[US Attorney General]] [[Benjamin R. Civiletti]] of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barceló during the investigations. Two leaders from the opposing parties, the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico|Popular Democratic Party]] and the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]], charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two, the Governor, then considered as a lifelong [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], began campaigning to deliver the 41 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[United States presidential nominating convention|convention vote]]s of the island for President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s (D) [[1980 Democratic National Convention|nomination for the presidency]] (ironically, Carter's opponent for the nomination was Senator Kennedy). Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate, the U.S. Justice Department announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end.&lt;ref name="Senator Inquiry"/&gt; A Justice Department internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barceló's and Civiletti's meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially incriminate the officers, including “several unexplained contusions” on a victim's face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story, stating that there was in fact “two bursts of firing”.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;

These and several other accusations brought public and political pressure to the investigating agencies. This led to internal revisions of evidence and procedures from the first investigations both at the local and federal level, though all organizations still adamantly denied any cover-up. These second investigations led to reassignments, demotions and resignations among top officials within the PR Justice Department, including three different P.R. Secretaries of Justice (equivalent to [[State Attorney General]]) accepting and resigning their posts in a span of six months.&lt;ref name="10 perjury"&gt;[http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m7.html "10 From Puerto Rico Police Indicted on Cover-Up of '78 Killings"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629183513/http://home.coqui.net/ciales15/m7.html |date=June 29, 2007 }} by Reginald Stuart, ''The New York Times'', February 7, 1984, Retrieved August 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On November 29, 1983, three prosecutors were relieved of their duties after a report by the state Senate Investigations Committee found they had failed to properly investigate the Cerro Maravilla shootings, citing 101 specific deficiencies in two investigations.&lt;ref name="Kneeling activists"/&gt; This was the third state Attorney General to oversee the investigations since the shootings occurred in 1978.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Aftermath==
The second investigations led to ten officers being indicted and found guilty of perjury, destruction of evidence, and obstruction of justice, four of which were convicted of second-degree murder in 1984.&lt;ref name="Romero"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10 perjury"/&gt; The convicted officers, who were no longer on [[active duty]], and their status with the Puerto Rico Police were:

# Col. Ángel Pérez Casillas (head of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] Intelligence Division during the incident; suspended)
# [[Lieutenant|Lieut.]] Nelson González Pérez (resigned)
# Lieut. Jaime Quíles Hernández (suspended)
# Officer Juan Bruno González (suspended)
# Officer William Colón Berríos (suspended)
# Officer Nazario Mateo Espada (suspended)
# Officer Rafael Moreno Morales (suspended)
# Officer Luis Reverón Martínez (on disability leave)
# Officer Jose Ríos Polanco (suspended)
# Officer Rafael Torres Marrero (on disability leave)

That same year, in [[Elections in Puerto Rico|the general elections]] held in November, Romero Barceló lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and opposing party rival [[Rafael Hernández Colón]] (PPD). It is widely accepted that Romero Barceló lost the elections because of this case, since his public opinion rating had deteriorated substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed, and since his political rivals used his defense of the officers as an indication of a possible conspiracy.&lt;ref name="Acquitted"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Romero Hurt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10 perjury"/&gt;

===Undercover agent murdered===
Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé, the undercover agent who was accompanying the activists, was not indicted for his part in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers, but was removed from the police force due to public pressure. In February 1986, he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver. His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and, therefore, it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping. This, despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage's life. The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint, drove the car, and, when the car approached the mountaintop, refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists. These actions, according to officer Cruz, were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage.&lt;ref name="Acquitted"/&gt; Nevertheless, the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer, a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over, and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated.&lt;ref name="25 años"&gt;[http://www.wrtu.org/secciones/analisis/Cerro%20Maravilla.html "Cerro Maravilla a 25 años: Lo que queda por esclarecer"] (25 Years After Cerro Maravilla: What’s Left to be Clarified) by Yaritza Cardona Mercado, WRTU Radio Universidad 89.7 FM, July 24, 2003, retrieved August 2, 2006 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of April 29, 1986, just two months after his acquittal, Gonzalez was assassinated in front of his mother's house in [[Bayamón]]. He sustained three gunshot wounds and his mother was slightly injured. A few hours later, a group identifying itself as the “Volunteer Organization for the Revolution” called local news agencies claiming responsibility. In their statements they swore to kill, "one by one," all the policemen involved in the deaths in Cerro Maravilla.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez Killed"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/01/us/police-agent-in-puerto-rico-deaths-is-assassinated.html "Police Agent in Puerto Rico Deaths is Assassinated"] ''The New York Times'', May 1, 1986, Retrieved August 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI considered it one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations in the United States at the time, given that it was the same organization that claimed responsibility for an attack on a [[United States Navy|Navy]] bus in Puerto Rico on December 3, 1979, in which two Navy men were killed and 10 people injured, and the attack on a [[U.S. National Guard]] base on January 12, 1981, in which six fighter-jet planes were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez Killed"/&gt; To this day, no one has been identified as a possible suspect in Gonzalez's murder, and the case remains unsolved.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Public apologies===
In 1992, former US Justice Department Civil Rights Division chief Drew S. Days III admitted before the P.R. Senate that the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI acted negligently during the 1978–1980 investigations of the Cerro Maravilla incident, such as rejecting interviews with key witnesses (including the taxi driver),&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; refusing to offer immunity to certain witnesses, and avoiding various standard investigating tasks. Days stated: "I think that certainly an apology is justified with respect to the way the federal government handled its investigation: the FBI, the Justice Department, and my division... it was not done in the professional way that it should have been done."&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; FBI Director William S. Sessions had made similar concessions in a written statement in 1990, stating: “In hindsight, the eyewitness should have been interviewed and a civil rights investigation initiated”.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;

In 2003, 25 years after the incident, former Gov. Romero Barceló admitted in a public radio interview that it was “an error of judgment” and “a premature declaration” to laud the police officers, since at that time he believed they were telling the truth about their self-defense.&lt;ref name="Romero"/&gt; However, he has publicly denied any wrongdoing regarding the alleged cover-up during the first investigations.

==Legacy==
*Since the conclusion of the final investigations, there has been heated debate about the Cerro Maravilla incident in Puerto Rico, with some groups arguing that there are still others responsible for planning and/or ordering the plot to kill the activists as well as the subsequent cover-up, while others have argued that the incident was exaggerated by rival politicians and the media, maintaining that no conspiracy ever took place and that some of the officers incarcerated, though not all, are actually innocent.&lt;ref name="Vocero"&gt;[http://www.pulso.org/Espanol/Archivo/cerro27.htm "What Happened in Cerro Maravilla?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216175151/http://www.pulso.org/Espanol/Archivo/cerro27.htm |date=December 16, 2005 }} {{es icon}} by Maggie Bob and Miguel Rocca, Pulso.org&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every year on July 25, [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party|Puerto Rican Nationalists]] and [[Puerto Rican independence movement|independence activists]] gather atop Cerro Maravilla to honor Carlos Soto and Arnaldo Dario, as well as to defend and celebrate the Puerto Rican independence ideology. It is usually organized by the family of the victims, former members of nationalist groups, and by the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]] (PIP). The mountain has also been christened by them as “El Cerro de los Mártires” (The Mountain of the Martyrs).&lt;ref name="25 años"/&gt;
*The American movie ''[[A Show of Force]]'' is loosely based on the events and theories behind the incident.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

'''Colonization of Antarctica''' refers to having humans including families living permanently on the continent of [[Antarctica]]. Currently, the continent only hosts a temporary transient population of scientists and support staff. Antarctica is the only continent on Earth without indigenous human inhabitants.

At present scientists and staff from 30 countries live on about 70 bases (40 year-round and 30 summer-only), with an approximate population of 4000 in summer and 1000 in winter. There have been at least eleven human births in Antarctica, eight at an [[Esperanza Base|Argentine base]] (including the first one) and three at a [[Base Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva|Chilean base]].

==Past colonization speculation==
An idea common in the 1950s was to have Antarctic cities enclosed under glass domes, which would make colonization of this continent possible. Power and temperature regulation of the domes would come from atomic driven generators outside of these domes. A light source at the top of the central tower had been proposed as an artificial sun during the dark months in Antarctica. This scenario would also include regular trans-Antarctic flights as well as mining towns which were dug into Antarctica's ice caps above the shafts down to mineral bearing mountains; however, there are problems with the idea of having an atomic driven generator giving the power and temperature regulation. The [[atomic reactor]] at [[McMurdo Station]] became a pollution hazard and hence was closed down long ago.&lt;ref&gt;Elzinga, Aant (1993). "Antarctica: The Construction of a Continent by and For Science". In Elisabeth Crawford, Terry Shinn, &amp; Sverker Sörlin (Eds.), ''Denationalizing Science: The Contexts of International Scientific Practice'', pp. 73-106. Dordrecht: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Antarctic Treaty System]], a series of international agreements, presently limit activities on Antarctica.  It would need to be modified or abandoned before large-scale colonization could legally occur, in particular with respect to the [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]].  On the other hand, it is the very impracticability of permanent colonization that has contributed to the failure of any of the territorial claims to receive international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Joyner, Christopher C. (1992). ''Antarctica and the Law of the Sea'', p. 49. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7923-1823-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domed cities==
[[Buckminster Fuller]], the developer of the [[geodesic dome]], had raised the possibility of Antarctic [[domed city|domed cities]] that would allow a controlled climate and buildings erected under the dome.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Robert W. (Aug. 23, 1959). "The Breakthrough of Buckminster Fuller".  ''The New York Times'', pp. SM14, SM15, SM42, SM44.&lt;/ref&gt; His first specific published proposal for a domed city in 1965 discussed the Antarctic as a likely first location for such a project.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Buckminster (Sep. 26, 1965). "[http://www.waltlockley.com/manhattandome/domeappendix.htm The Case for Domed Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025417/http://www.waltlockley.com/manhattandome/domeappendix.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}". ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second base at [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] (operated 1975-2003) resembles a reduced version of this idea; it is only large enough to cover a few scientific buildings.

In 1971, a team led by German architect [[Frei Otto]] made a feasibility study for an [[air-supported structure|air-supported]] city dome two kilometers across that could house 40,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Derek (1998). ''Happold: The Confidence to Build'', p. 63. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|0-419-24070-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors have recently tried to update the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Болонкин, Александр Александрович|Alexander Bolonkin]] and Cathcart, Richard B. (May 2007). [https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0701098 "Inflatable ‘Evergreen’ dome settlements for Earth’s Polar Regions"]. ''Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy'' '''9''' (2), [http://www.springerlink.com/content/7861x07695429514/ 125&amp;ndash;132].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future conditions==
Though the environment of Antarctica is too harsh for permanent human settlement to be worthwhile, conditions may become better in the future. It has been suggested that, as a result of [[long-term effects of global warming]], the beginning of the 22nd century will see parts of West Antarctica experiencing similar climate conditions to those found today in Alaska and Northern Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;''How to survive the coming century'', NewScientist [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126971.700-how-to-survive-the-coming-century.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Even farming and crop growing could be possible in some of the most northerly areas of Antarctica.

==The first person known to be born on the continent of Antarctica==
[[Emilio Palma|Emilio Marcos Palma]] (born January 7, 1978) is an Argentine citizen who is the first person known to be born on the continent of Antarctica. He was born in Fortín Sargento Cabral at the Esperanza Base near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and weighed 3.4&amp;nbsp;kg (7&amp;nbsp;lb 8 oz).

The '''consistent life ethic''', or the '''consistent ethic of life''' is an ideology that opposes [[abortion]], [[capital punishment]], [[assisted suicide]], and [[euthanasia]]. Adherents are opposed, at the very least, to [[Just War|unjust war]], while some adherents also profess [[pacifism]], or opposition to all war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/opinion/sunday/catholics-and-the-power-of-political-communion.html?_r=1 | work=New York Times | title=The Power of Political Communion | date=15 September 2012 | accessdate=18 September 2012 | first1=Molly | last1=Worthen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized in 1983 by the Catholic Cardinal [[Joseph Bernardin]] to express an ideology based on the premise that all [[Sanctity of life|human life is sacred]] and should be protected by law.&lt;ref name="Bernardin, Joseph 1988"&gt;Bernardin, Joseph. ''Consistent ethics of life'' 1988, Sheed and Ward&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The phrase "consistent ethic of life" was used as far back as a 1971 speech delivered by then-Archbishop [[Humberto Medeiros]] of Boston.&lt;ref name=Gregg&gt;{{cite news | last=Gregg | first=Samuel | title=The Consistent—and Not So Seamless—Ethic of Life | website=Catholic World Report | date=13 August 2015 | url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/4098/the_consistentand_not_so_seamlessethic_of_life.aspx | ref=harv | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eileen Egan ===

In 1971, [[Roman Catholic]] [[pacifist]] [[Eileen Egan]] coined the phrase "seamless garment" to describe a holistic reverence for life.&lt;ref name="Dear 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leach&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/soul-seeing/cardinal-bernardin's-gift-fits-all-sizes |last=Leach |first=Michael |title=Cardinal Bernardin's gift fits all sizes |work=National Catholic Reporter |date=6 November 2012 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is a [[Bible]] reference from John 19:23 to the [[seamless robe of Jesus]], which his executioners did not tear apart. The seamless garment philosophy holds that issues such as abortion, capital punishment, militarism, euthanasia, social injustice, and economic injustice all demand a consistent application of moral principles that value the sacredness of human life. "The protection of life", said Egan, "is a seamless garment. You can't protect some life and not others."  Her words were meant to challenge those members of the [[pro-life]] movement who were in favor of capital punishment.

=== Joseph Cardinal Bernardin ===
Cardinal [[Joseph Bernardin]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Chicago]] helped publicize the consistent life ethic idea in 1983.{{sfn|Bernardin|1988|p=v}}{{nonspecific|date=July 2017}}  Initially, Bernardin spoke out against nuclear war and abortion. However, he quickly expanded the scope of his view to include all aspects of human life. In one of the first speeches given on the topic at Fordham University, Bernardin said: "The spectrum of life cuts across the issues of genetics, abortion, capital punishment, modern warfare and the care of the terminally ill."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Overberg, Kenneth R. S.J.:"A Consistent Ethic of Life", Catholic Update, St. Anthony's Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Bernardin said that although each of the issues was distinct, nevertheless the issues were linked since the valuing and defending of (human) life were, he believed, at the center of both issues. Bernardin told an audience in Portland, Oregon: "When human life is considered 'cheap' or easily expendable in one area, eventually nothing is held as sacred and all lives are in jeopardy."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Bernardin drew his stance from New Testament principles, specifically of forgiveness and reconciliation, yet he argued that neither the themes nor the content generated from those themes were specifically Christian.&lt;ref name="Walter, James J 2005"&gt;Walter, James J. and Shannon, Thomas A.: ''Contemporary Issues in Bioethics: A Catholic perspective'', Rowan and Littlefeild Publishers, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; By doing this, Bernardin attempted to create a dialogue with others who were not necessarily aligned with Christianity.

Bernardin and other advocates of this ethic sought to form a consistent policy that would link abortion, capital punishment, economic injustice, euthanasia, and unjust war.&lt;ref name="Bernardin, Joseph 1988" /&gt; Bernardin sought to unify conservative Catholics (who opposed abortion) and liberal Catholics (who opposed capital punishment) in the United States. By relying on fundamental principles, Bernardin also sought to coordinate work on several different spheres of Catholic [[moral theology]]. In addition, Bernardin argued that since the 1950s the church had moved against its own historical, [[casuistry|casuistic]] exceptions to the protection of life. "To summarize the shift succinctly, the presumption against taking human life has been strengthened and the exceptions made ever more restrictive."&lt;ref name="Bernardin, Joseph 1988" /&gt;

=== Other supporters ===
[[File:Hentoff bio.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Consistent Life Ethic has spread from Catholic theology to supporters such as [[Nat Hentoff]]]]
The non-profit organization Consistent Life Network, founded in 1987 as the Seamless Garment Network, promotes adherence to the ethic through education and non-violent action.  Individual endorsers belonging to the Consistent Life Network organization include Father [[Daniel Berrigan]], theologian [[Harvey Cox]], ''Village Voice'' columnist [[Nat Hentoff]], Father [[Theodore Hesburgh]], actress [[Patricia Heaton]], ''[[L'Arche]]'' founder [[Jean Vanier]], death penalty activist Sister [[Helen Prejean]], pro-life activist [[Abby Johnson (activist)|Abby Johnson]], author [[Ken Kesey]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Rowan Williams]] and Nobel Peace Prize laureates [[Mairead Corrigan Maguire]] and [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]].&lt;ref name="endorsers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Consistent Life Individual Endorsers As of January 9, 2017|url=http://www.consistent-life.org/clsigners.pdf|website=Consistent Life Network|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachel MacNair]], for ten years (1994–2004) President of [[Feminists for Life]], a pro-life organization,&lt;ref&gt;MacNair, R.M.

In the US, several groups have promoted the "consistent ethic of life" approach, including the [[USCCB|United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], [[Democrats for Life of America]], and the [[American Solidarity Party]], a [[Christian Democratic]] political organization.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite news| last=Hughes | first=Mariann | title=The search for a third way in U.S. politics | work=Our Sunday Visitor | date=30 October 2016 | url=https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Article/TabId/535/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/20947/The-search-for-a-third-way-in-US-politics.aspx | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Complete Platform | website=American Solidarity Party | url=http://www.solidarity-party.org/complete-platform | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups without a religious orientation that support the ideology include Democrats for Life of America, the Pro-Life Alliance of Gays and Lesbians (PLAGAL), and All Our Lives (a pro-contraception feminist group), all of which are members of the Consistent Life Network. Other secular groups supporting a consistent ethic of life position include Rehumanize International (formerly known as Life Matters Journal)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rehumanizeintl.org/ http://www.rehumanizeintl.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/cover_story/2016/10/the_future_of_the_pro_life_movement.html|title=The New Culture of Life|last=Graham|first=Ruth|date=11 October 2016|work=Slate|access-date=10 April 2017|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Wave Feminists]].&lt;ref name="Halper 2016"&gt;{{cite news | last=Halper | first=Daniel | title=WH Denies Endorsement Will Intimidate FBI Investigators | work=Weekly Standard | date=9 June 2016 | url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/wh-denies-endorsement-will-intimidate-fbi-investigators/article/2002757 | accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About | website=New Wave Feminists | url=https://www.newwavefeminists.com/about | accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent authors who have written in support of the consistent life ethic include [[Frank Pavone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pavone |first=Frank |url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/columns/4378-the-consistent-ethic-of-life-myths-and-realities |title=The Consistent Ethic of Life: Myths and Realities |website=Priests for Life |date=1 January 1999 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Martin (priest, born 1960)|James Martin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/gun-control-pro-life-issue Gun Control is a Pro-Life Issue, America, 17 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dear]],&lt;ref name="Dear 2008"&gt;{{cite web | last=Dear | first=John | title=The Consistent Ethic of Life | website=FatherJohnDear.org | date=15 July 2008 | url=http://www.fatherjohndear.org/articles/the_consistent_ethic.html | archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131019001027/http://www.fatherjohndear.org/articles/the_consistent_ethic.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=19 October 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dear 2005"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dear | first=J. | title=The God of Peace: Toward A Theology of Nonviolence | publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers | year=2005 | isbn=978-1-59752-112-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xE5LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158 | accessdate=9 March 2017 | p=158ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endorsers-web"&gt;{{cite web | title=Consistent Life Network Endorsers | website=Consistent Life Network | url=http://www.consistentlifenetwork.org/endorsers | accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Sider]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sider|first1=Ron|title=Completely Pro-Life|date=1987|publisher=Intervarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1706-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Campolo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campolo|first1=Tony|title=Who is Really Pro-Life?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-campolo/who-is-really-prolife_b_31947.html|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=18 October 2006}} (revised 25 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Jonathan|title=Tony Campolo hits hard on abortion, gay marriage, Israel and more|url=http://religionnews.com/2013/12/17/tony-campolo-hits-hard-hot-button-issues/|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=Religion News Service|date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pally" /&gt; [[Joel Hunter]],&lt;ref name="Pally"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pally|first1=Marcia|title=The New Evangelicals: How Christians are rethinking Abortion and Gay Marriage|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2011/12/28/3399068.htm|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=Australian Broadcasting Commission|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wendell Berry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |last=Berry |first=Wendell |date=22 June 1986 |subject=The consequences of treating a fetus as a human being: Reader survey on abortion |work=Whole Earth Review |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/nvp/consistent/whole-earth.html |access-date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berry |first=Wendell |title=The failure of war}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endorsers-web" /&gt; and [[Shane Claiborne]].&lt;ref name="Pally" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claiborne|first1=Shane|title=A Dialogue on What it Means to be Pro-Life|url=https://www.redletterchristians.org/a-dialogue-on-what-it-means-to-be-pro-life/|website=Red Letter Christians|accessdate=13 January 2017|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Claiborne|first1=Shane|title=The Irresistible Revolution|publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
According to Michael Leach, "If one contends, as we do, that the right of every fetus to be born should be protected by civil law and supported by civil consensus, then our moral, political and economic responsibilities do not stop at the moment of birth."&lt;ref name=Leach /&gt; This viewpoint was emphasized by Pope John Paul II in his 1995 encyclical, ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'' (Gospel of Life).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=John Paul II |url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae.html |title=Evangelium Vitae |location=Vatican City |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book-length document outlined the Pope's emphasis on fostering a [[culture of life]] based on the New Testament and the life of Jesus. Specifically, he emphasized the value and inviolability of human life, from conception until natural death.

=== Abortion ===
{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}

Rather than "thinking of a pregnant women and her fetus as being adversaries battling over exclusive rights, the right of a woman to control her body versus the right of the fetus to live long enough to control hers", a consistent life ethic would view both as valuable and important, and seek to provide both all the support they needed to live and live well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |title=The consequences of treating a fetus as a human being |work=Whole Earth Review |date=22 June 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capital punishment ===
{{See also|Catholic Church and capital punishment}}
Traditionally, arguments for the death penalty focus on the idea that it: 1) deters further violence; 2) enacts just retribution on the criminal, effectively gaining a sense of justice for society and those affected by the crime; 3) seeks to reform other criminals with the threat of such severe punishment and; 4) protects society from those criminals which the government has deemed to be the most heinous.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Bernardin and some other consistent life ethic advocates recognize the right of the state to use capital punishment. However, they reject the necessity of this type of punishment for many reasons, arguing that there are more appropriate and effective ways for the state to defend its people.  Many consistent life ethic advocates call for a total abolition of the death penalty.  The consistent ethic's opposition to capital punishment is rooted in the conviction that an atmosphere of respect for life must pervade a society, and resorting to the death penalty does not support this attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardin, Cardinal Joseph A.: ''The Seamless Garment: Writings on the Consistent Ethic of Life'' Orbis Books, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents argue that the result of the death penalty&amp;nbsp;– removing the criminal from society, enacting justice on the criminal, and bringing about feelings of revenge for those affected and the greater society&amp;nbsp;– do not necessarily have to be accomplished by taking a life.

One out-spoken anti-death penalty activist is Sister [[Helen Prejean]]. Her books ''[[Dead Man Walking (book)|Dead Man Walking]]'' and ''The Death of Innocents: An Eyewitness Account to Wrongful Executions'' are autobiographical accounts of the time she spent ministering to death row inmates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rachel MacNair|MacNair, Rachel M.]], and Zunes, Stephen: ''Consistently Opposing Killing: from abortion to assisted suicide, the death penalty and war'', pages 58–60. Praeger Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable independent Catholic anti-death penalty organization is [[Priests for Life]].

=== Health care ===
Bernardin understood the consistent life ethic as implying a societal responsibility to provide adequate health care for all, especially the poor.{{sfn|Bernardin|1985}}{{sfn|Bernardin|1986}}{{sfn|Bernardin|1986}}

According to Ron Hamel,&lt;blockquote&gt;...a moral vision constituted by the consistent ethic of life sensitizes one to procedures, technological developments, and aspects of the health care system that fail to promote or do not adequately promote human dignity and do not sufficiently enhance human life. ...it is not sufficient to only oppose euthanasia, but one must also be concerned about and address those factors that give rise to euthanasia and find ever better ways to care for the dying and ensure the dying the opportunity to forgo treatment and to live their lives fully while dying.&lt;ref name=Hamel&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.chausa.org/publications/health-progress/article/november-december-2008/twenty-five-years-later-cardinal-bernardin's-consistent-ethic-of-life |last=Hamel |first=Ron |title=Twenty-Five Years Later: Cardinal Bernardin's Consistent Ethic of Life |work=Health Progress |date=November 2008 |p=56-59 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, appeals to the consistent life ethic have been made in support of universal health care.&lt;ref name="LIC-2009"&gt;{{cite journal | title=On health care, a consistent ethic of life | work=The Long Island Catholic | volume=48 | issue=23 | date=30 September 2009 | url=http://www.newspaper.licatholic.org/editorial/health-care-consistent-ethic-life | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Refugees ===
The consistent life ethic has been invoked to include care for immigrants and refugees.&lt;ref name="Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Scribner | first=Todd | title=The Gospel of Life and the Catholic approach to the refugee crisis | website=Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good | date=31 July 2014 | url=http://www.catholicsinalliance.org/refugeecrisis | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIC-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adkins"&gt;{{cite web | last=Adkins | first=Jason | title=Catholic Spirit: Border children and a consistent ethic of life | website=Minnesota Catholic Conference | date=13 August 2014 | url=https://mncatholic.org/catholic-spirit-border-children-consistent-ethic-life/ | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kangas 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kangas | first=Billy | title=Keeping "Pro-Life" Consistent | website=The Orant | date=22 January 2015 | url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/billykangas/2015/01/keeping-pro-life-consistent.html | accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not directly appealing to the consistent life ethic, other Catholics have sought to apply the "pro-life" ethic to the issue of immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Snyder |first=L. |display-authors=etal|title=Catholic Leaders to Congress: Immigration Reform is a Pro-Life Issue |date=20 January 2015 |publisher=Faith in Public Life |url=http://www.faithinpubliclife.org/immigrationlife/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329173750/http://www.faithinpubliclife.org/immigrationlife/ |archive-date=29 March 2016 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen 2014"&gt;{{cite news | last=Allen | first=John L.

== Criticisms ==
One criticism made of the consistent life ethic position is that it inadvertently helped provide "cover" or support for politicians who supported legalized abortion or wanted to minimize this issue, a circumstance that Bernardin himself both recognized and deplored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ronald N.|last=Neff|url=http://www.sobran.com/columns/2005/050816.shtml |title=The "Seamless Garment" Revisited |work=Sobran's |date=16 August 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregg /&gt;
A critic of [[Joseph Bernardin]], [[George Weigel]] rejected the claims that the consistent life ethic had been created to cover up for abortion rights, saying that Bernardin was "a committed pro-lifer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Weigel |first=George |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2011/02/the-end-of-the-bernardin-era |title=The End of the Bernardin Era: The rise, dominance, and decline of a culturally accommodating Catholicism |work=First Things |date=February 2011 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop [[José Horacio Gómez|José Gómez]] of Los Angeles criticized the "seamless garment" approach in 2016 because in his view it results in "a mistaken idea that all issues are morally equivalent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff Reporter | title=Archbishop Gomez: The Root Violence in Our Society Is the Violence Against the Most Vulnerable | work=National Catholic Register | date=4 February 2016 | url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/archbishop-gomez-the-root-violence-in-our-society-is-the-violence-against-t | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eli"&gt;{{cite news | last=Eli | first=Bradley| title=Abp.

== Attack ==
According to [[Save the Children]], at the time of the attack the children were on a bus heading back to school from a picnic when the driver stopped to get refreshment at the market in Dahyan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most of the children were under age 10, according to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A Red Cross – supported hospital in [[Sa'dah|Saada]] received the bodies of 29 children under 15 years of age and 48 wounded individuals, 30 of whom were children.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-arabia-airstrike-yemen-kids-killed-bus-dahyan-market-saada-icrc-says/|title=Saudi coalition airstrike in Yemen kills 50, rebels say|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 40 children were killed in the strike.&lt;ref&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/17/middleeast/us-saudi-yemen-bus-strike-intl/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a resident of Dahyan, the warplanes had been hovering over the area for more than an hour before they attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/dozens-children-killed-and-injured-airstrike-yemen-bus-red-cross-says-61507076|title=At least 29 children killed by Saudi-led air strike on Yemeni school bus|work=Middle East Eye|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another witness said, "Our shops were open and shoppers were walking around as usual.

The bomb that killed the children was a [[MK 82 bomb]] made by [[Lockheed Martin]]. It had been supplied by the [[United States]] to [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=CNN17/&gt;

== Media coverage ==
The attack came to light after videos were posted on [[Twitter]] depicting the remains of the bus and the children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Images of the victims were aired on the [[Almasirah|Al Masirah TV]] network, highlighting dramatic images of blood and debris-covered children lying on hospital stretchers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Saudi Arabian coalition later issued a statement saying that they conducted an airstrike in Saada but were targeting [[Houthi]] missile launchers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The mass funeral of the children was aired on the Al Mariah TV network, with thousands of Yemenis participating.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/14/protests-at-funeral-for-yemeni-children-killed-in-coalition-strike.html|title=Protests at funeral for Yemeni children killed in coalition strike|last=Post|first=The Jakarta|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

=== Domestic ===
The official Saudi Arabian press agency called the strike a "legitimate military action" which targeted those who were responsible for a rebel missile attack on the Saudi Arabian city of [[Jizan]] on Wednesday.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/world/middleeast/yemen-airstrike-school-bus-children.html|title=Saudi Coalition Bombs School Bus in Yemen, Killing Dozens|access-date=10 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claimed that the airstrikes "conformed to international and humanitarian laws"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and that [[Houthis]] were using children as human shields.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Yemeni journalist Nasser Arrabyee reported that there were no Houthis in the vicinity of the strike.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A Houthi spokesman said that the coalition showed "clear disregard for civilian life", as the attack had targeted a crowded public place in the city.&lt;ref name="Reuters 9082018" /&gt; During the mass funeral of the children, many signs were visible protesting against the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On 1 September 2018, the Saudi Arabian-led coalition admitted mistakes, expressing regrets and pledged to hold those responsible for the strikes accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45382561|title='Mistakes' admitted in Yemen bus attack|date=2018-09-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 1957, '''Mary Jane Barker''', an American 4-year-old girl from [[Bellmawr, New Jersey]] (southeast of [[Philadelphia]]), United States went missing along with her playmate's dog. After an extensive search throughout the city, dubbed by the press as "the largest search in [[South Jersey]]", her dead body was discovered by her playmate in the closet of a vacant house near her home on March 3. The dog bounded out of the closet, seemingly unharmed.

Despite the initial suspicion of foul play, the death was ruled an accident; a case of [[starvation]] and exposure as Barker was unable to escape the closet. Investigators concluded that Barker died on February 28, three days after her disappearance. As a result, the mayor ordered closet doors to open more easily. The press surrounding the Barker case also led to the first calls about the [[Boy in the Box (Philadelphia)|Boy in the Box]].

==Birth and siblings==
Mary Jane Barker was born in Bellmawr, New Jersey, U.S., on February 28, 1953, to Mr. and Mrs. Frank Barker. She had two older siblings: Carol Ann, 8 years older; and Frank Jr., 6 years older.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1957/03/04/page/1/article/missing-girl-4-found-dead|work=[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]|title=Missing Girl, 4, Found Dead|date=March 4, 1957|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170423215256/http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1957/03/04/page/1/article/missing-girl-4-found-dead|archivedate=April 23, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Barker disappeared along with a four-month old black [[spaniel]] puppy at 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Monday, February 25, 1957, in Bellmawr.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; She was last seen playing in a nearby yard, going to meet with her friend and neighbor, 6-year-old Maria Freitta, the owner of the dog. Police were notified by 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. She was presumed kidnapped, and the next day footprints were found along a nearby stream bank which  seemed those of a man, child, and dog. The police stated that the small footprints on the mud matched the size of Barker's shoes.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite news|title=Steps In Hunt For Mary Jane|date=March 4, 1957|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iowan/&gt;

===Search===
Her disappearance "touched off an intensive search for a kidnapper or murderer" according to ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. It was called "the largest search in [[South Jersey]]."&lt;ref name=inqmjp/&gt; Hundreds of volunteers and police searched the city.&lt;ref name=iowan&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl Missing May Be Case Of Kidnapping|url=http://dailyiowan.lib.uiowa.edu/DI/1957/di1957-02-28.pdf|work=[[The Daily Iowan]]|date=February 28, 1957|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426202122/http://dailyiowan.lib.uiowa.edu/DI/1957/di1957-02-28.pdf|archivedate=April 26, 2016|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first night more than 200 civilians did a foot-by-foot search. Eventually well over a thousand people were involved. Her fourth birthday came and went with no sign of her.&lt;ref name=inqmjp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%2023/Philadelphia%20PA%20Inquirer/Philadelphia%20PA%20Inquirer%201957/Philadelphia%20PA%20Inquirer%201957%20-%203679.pdf|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=March 4, 1957|title=Missing Girl Found Dead In Closet Of Vacant House Near Her Home|pages=1; 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, February 27, the parents made an appeal on television to anyone who may have kidnapped Barker, asking them to "leave the child in the nearest church." Vern Lovering, a 43-year old floor sander and convicted child molester had been questioned, and said he was near the Barker home. On Thursday, February 28, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) conducted its own search, and the next day again questioned Lovering after police received a phone call demanding $500 ransom. Police made an appeal to the kidnapper not to "act in haste or do harm to the child."&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

The grief of the Barker family was especially acute on February 28 and March 1 since those were the birthdays of Barker and her father, and they were planning to have a joint celebration that week. The police stated that they were working on several leads but had no developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother Certain Mary Jane Barker Has Been Kidnapped|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19570227&amp;id=AW0mAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6326,2154855|work=[[The Gettysburg Times]]|date=March 1, 1957|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170423220151/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19570227&amp;id=AW0mAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6326,2154855|archivedate=April 23, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Saturday, March 2, the FBI was officially called in following the provisions of the [[Federal Kidnapping Act]]. Several nearby dumps were searched to no avail.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

==Discovery of body==
On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, the owner of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built [[ranch house]] next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Maria managed to open a 3&amp;nbsp;ft × 5&amp;nbsp;ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2691586/the_times/|work=[[The Times of Northwest Indiana|The Times]]|date=March 4, 1957|page=1|accessdate=June 26, 2015|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|title=Girl Dies, Puppy Lives|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170423220400/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2691586/the_times/|archivedate=April 23, 2017|deadurl=no}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat partially covering her blonde hair.&lt;ref name=inqmjp/&gt; She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off.&lt;ref name=inqmjp/&gt; Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.&lt;ref name=eagle/&gt;

During previous searches, including a visit by a repairman,&lt;ref name=eagle&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19570304&amp;id=QuQiAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5434,1508482|title=Jersey Girl|date=March 4, 1957|work=[[Reading Eagle]]|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170423220508/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19570304&amp;id=QuQiAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5434,1508482|archivedate=April 23, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; no dog was heard.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2691658/the_times_standard/|work=[[Times-Standard]]|title=Missing Youngster Found Starved To Death In Closet of New Home|date=March 4, 1957|page=21|accessdate=June 26, 2015|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170423220909/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2691658/the_times_standard/|archivedate=April 23, 2017|deadurl=no}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house had been searched three times before, but the bedroom closet where her body was found was not searched.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Rev.

Although the door was unlocked, a thumb screw inside apparently made it difficult for a child to open.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The door had a knob on the outside, but only a small turn latch on the inside.&lt;ref name=starved/&gt;

==Autopsy==
On March 4, the autopsy indicated Barker had nothing in her system since some [[chocolate milk]] the morning of her disappearance,&lt;ref name=inqmjp/&gt;&lt;ref name=starv/&gt; and had not eaten since she vanished. There was no indication of foul play;&lt;ref name=amste&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Amsterdam%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat%20and%20Recorder/Amsterdam%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat%20and%20Recorder%201957%20Mar-Apr%20Grayscale/Amsterdam%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat%20and%20Recorder%201957%20Mar-Apr%20Grayscale%20-%200026.pdf|work=Amsterdam Evening Recorder|title=Closet Yields Body of Child, Missing 5 Days|date=March 4, 1957|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170423222226/http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Amsterdam%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat%20and%20Recorder/Amsterdam%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat%20and%20Recorder%201957%20Mar-Apr%20Grayscale/Amsterdam%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat%20and%20Recorder%201957%20Mar-Apr%20Grayscale%20-%200026.pdf|archivedate=April 23, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; no signs of violence or [[Sexual abuse|sexual molestation]].&lt;ref name=inqmjp/&gt; It was found she must have lived in the closet for three days without food or drink.

[[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]] Coroner Robert J.

On March 7, Mayor Cornelius Devennel ordered all closet doors to be equipped with special knobs that can open easily from both inside and outside.

===Boy in the Box===
The press surrounding the Barker case led to the first calls about the [[Boy in the Box (Philadelphia)|Boy in the Box]].

==Life==
[[File:Mackellar as a "Grace" (1918).jpg|thumb|left|Dorothea Mackellar dressed as one of the Graces for [[Ethel Knight Kelly|Mrs. T.H. Kelly's]] Italian Red Cross Day tableaux at the Palace Theatre, 20 June 1918]]
The third child and only daughter of physician and parliamentarian Sir [[Charles Mackellar]] and his wife Marion MacKellar (née Buckland), the daughter of Thomas Buckland, she was born in the family home ''[[Dunara]]'' at [[Point Piper]], [[Sydney]], Australia in 1885. Her later home was ''Cintra'' at [[Darling Point, New South Wales|Darling Point]] (built in 1882 by [[Lindesay, Darling Point#The Macintosh family in residence|John Mackintosh]] for his son James), and in 1925, she commissioned a summer cottage (in reality a substantial home with colonnaded verandah overlooking Pittwater), "Tarrangaua" at [[Lovett Bay, New South Wales|Lovett Bay]], an isolated location on [[Pittwater]] reachable only by boat (this home is currently the residence of the novelist and author [[Susan Duncan]] and her husband, Bob Story, and features prominently in a number of Susan's books). A woman of independent means, she published poetry and other works between 1908 and 1926 and was active in the Sydney literary scene of the 1930s, being involved with the Sydney Publishers, Editors and Novelists Club, the Bush Book Club of New South Wales and the Sydney P.E.N. Club. In her later years she ceased writing and, suffering poor health, her last eleven years were spent in a nursing home in [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]] where she died in 1968, aged 82. She is buried in [[Waverley Cemetery]], in Sydney's Eastern suburbs in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Mackellar-13 WikiTree: Isobel Marion Dorothea Mackellar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==
Although she was raised in a professional urban family, Mackellar's poetry is usually regarded as quintessential [[bush poet]]ry, inspired by her experience on her brothers' farms near [[Gunnedah, New South Wales|Gunnedah]], in the north-west of [[New South Wales]]. Her best-known poem is ''[[My Country]]'', written at age 19&lt;ref name="adb"/&gt; while homesick in [[England]], and first published in the [[London]] [[The Spectator|''Spectator'']] in 1908 under the title ''Core of My Heart'': the second stanza of this poem is among the best known in [[Australia]]. Four volumes of her collected verse were published: ''The Closed Door'' (published in 1911, contained the first appearance of ''My Country''); ''The Witch Maid, and Other Verses'' (1914); ''Dreamharbour'' (1923); and ''Fancy Dress'' (1926).

In addition to writing poems, Mackellar also wrote novels, one by herself, ''Outlaw's Luck'' (1913), and at least two in collaboration with [[Ruth Bedford]]. These are ''The Little Blue Devil'' (1912) and ''Two's Company'' (1914). According to Dale Spender, little has been written or is yet known about the circumstances behind this collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Spender, Dale (1988) ''Writing a New World: Two Centuries of Australian Women Writers'', London: Pandora p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours ==
In the New Year's Day Honours of 1968, Dorothea Mackellar was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] for her contribution to [[Australian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1108726&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true|title=MACKELLAR, Isobel Marion Dorothea|work=It's an Honour|accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died two weeks later in [[Paddington, New South Wales]] after a fall. She is buried with her father and family in [[Waverley Cemetery]] overlooking the open ocean. Also her poem ''Colour'', her own favourite, was read at the service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waverley.nsw.gov.au/library/localstudies/historical/cm_wlk_1.htm Waverley Cemetery - A Walk Through History No. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308201339/http://www.waverley.nsw.gov.au/library/localstudies/historical/cm_wlk_1.htm |date=2008-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A [[Division of Mackellar|federal electorate]] covering half of Sydney's [[Northern Beaches (Sydney)|Northern Beaches]] is named in her honour as well as a street in the [[Canberra]] suburb of [[Cook, Australian Capital Territory|Cook]]. (The Canberra suburb of [[McKellar, Australian Capital Territory|McKellar]] was not named after her, but is often assumed to have been.)

On [[Australia Day]], 26 January 1983, a memorial to Dorothea Mackellar was unveiled and dedicated in ANZAC Park, Gunnedah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/people/arts/display/21461-dorothea-mackellar Monument Australia]. Retrieved 22 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The centrepiece of the memorial, a statue of Mackellar on horseback by Dennis Adams, was a temporary fibreglass version.  The finished bronze version was installed in September 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorothea.com.au/index.php/about-us/sculpture-artwork/ dorothea mackellar poetry awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227225156/http://www.dorothea.com.au/index.php/about-us/sculpture-artwork/ |date=February 27, 2014 }}. Retrieved 22 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the January unveiling, there was an exhibition of a series of 34 water colour paintings by [[Jean Isherwood]] illustrating the writer's most famous poem, ''My Country''. The watercolours were eventually put on permanent display in the Gunnedah Bicentennial Regional Gallery. Isherwood set about painting a series of oils based on the watercolours which were exhibited at the Artarmon Galleries in Sydney in 1986.

In 1984, Gunnedah resident Mikie Maas created the "Dorothea Mackellar Poetry Awards", which has grown into a nationwide poetry competition for Australian school students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54323">'''Dynamic epistemic logic''' (DEL) is a logical framework dealing with knowledge and information change. Typically, DEL focuses on situations involving multiple [[Intelligent agent|agents]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and studies how their knowledge changes when [[Event (philosophy)|events]] occur. These events can change factual properties of the actual world (they are called ''ontic events''): for example a red card is painted in blue. They can also bring about changes of knowledge without changing factual properties of the world (they are called ''epistemic events''): for example a card is revealed publicly (or privately) to be red. Originally, DEL focused on epistemic events. We only present in this entry some of the basic ideas of the original DEL framework; more details about DEL in general can be found in the references.

Due to the nature of its object of study and its abstract approach, DEL is related and has applications to numerous research areas, such as [[computer science]] ([[artificial intelligence]]), [[philosophy]] ([[formal epistemology]]), [[economics]] ([[game theory]]) and [[cognitive science]]. In computer science, DEL is for example very much related to [[multi-agent systems]], which are systems where multiple intelligent agents interact and exchange information.

As a combination of [[Dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] and [[epistemic logic]], dynamic epistemic logic is a young field of research. It really started in 1989 with Plaza’s logic of public announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Logics of public communications|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-007-9168-7|journal = Synthese|date = 2007-07-26|issn = 0039-7857|pages = 165–179|volume = 158|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s11229-007-9168-7|first = Jan|last = Plaza}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Independently, Gerbrandy and Groeneveld&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reasoning about Information Change|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008222603071|journal = Journal of Logic, Language and Information|date = 1997-04-01|issn = 0925-8531|pages = 147–169|volume = 6|issue = 2|doi = 10.1023/A:1008222603071|first = Jelle|last = Gerbrandy|first2 = Willem|last2 = Groeneveld}}&lt;/ref&gt;  proposed a system dealing moreover with private announcement and that was inspired by the work of Veltman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defaults in update semantics|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00248150|journal = Journal of Philosophical Logic|date = 1996-06-01|issn = 0022-3611|pages = 221–261|volume = 25|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/BF00248150|first = Frank|last = Veltman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another system was proposed by van Ditmarsch whose main inspiration was the [[Cluedo]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Descriptions of Game Actions|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1015590229647|journal = Journal of Logic, Language and Information|date = 2002-06-01|issn = 0925-8531|pages = 349–365|volume = 11|issue = 3|doi = 10.1023/A:1015590229647|first = Hans P. van|last = Ditmarsch}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the most influential and original system was the system proposed by Baltag, Moss and Solecki.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Logics for Epistemic Programs|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B%3ASYNT.0000024912.56773.5e|journal = Synthese|date = 2004-03-01|issn = 0039-7857|pages = 165–224|volume = 139|issue = 2|doi = 10.1023/B:SYNT.0000024912.56773.5e|first = Alexandru|last = Baltag|first2 = Lawrence S.|last2 = Moss}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system can deal with all the types of situations studied in the works above and its underlying methodology is conceptually grounded. We will present in this entry some of its basic ideas.

Formally, DEL extends ordinary [[epistemic logic]] by the inclusion of event models to describe actions, and a product update operator that defines how epistemic models are updated as the consequence of executing actions described through event models. [[Epistemic logic]] will first be recalled. Then, actions and events will enter into the picture and we will introduce the DEL framework.&lt;ref&gt;A distinction is sometimes made between events and actions, an action being a specific type of event performed by an agent.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemic Logic ==

[[Epistemic logic]] is a [[modal logic]] dealing with the notions of knowledge and belief. As a [[logic]], it is concerned with understanding the process of ''reasoning'' about knowledge and belief: which principles relating the notions of knowledge and belief are intuitively plausible? Like epistemology, it stems from the Greek word &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\pi\iota\sigma\tau\eta\mu\eta&lt;/math&gt; or ‘episteme’ meaning knowledge. [[Epistemology]] is nevertheless more concerned with analyzing the very ''nature'' and ''scope'' of knowledge, addressing questions such as “What is the definition of knowledge?” or “How is knowledge acquired?”. In fact, epistemic logic grew out of epistemology in the Middle Ages thanks to the efforts of Burley and Ockham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Epistemic Logic in the later Middle Ages|last = Boh|first = Ivan|publisher = Routledge|year = 1993|isbn = 0415057264|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal work, based on modal logic, that inaugurated contemporary research into epistemic logic dates back only to 1962 and is due to [[Hintikka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Knowledge and Belief, An Introduction to the Logic of the Two Notions|last = Jaako|first = Hintikka|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 1962|isbn = 1904987087|location = Ithaca and London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It then sparked in the 1960s discussions about the principles of knowledge and belief and many axioms for these notions were proposed and discussed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Recent Work in Epistemic Logic|last = Lenzen|first = Wolfgang|date = 1978|journal = Acta Philosophica Fennica|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the interaction axioms &lt;math&gt;K p\rightarrow B p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B p\rightarrow KB p&lt;/math&gt; are often considered to be intuitive principles: if an agent Knows &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; then (s)he also Believes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, or if an agent Believes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, then (s)he Knows that (s)he Believes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. More recently, these kinds of philosophical theories were taken up by researchers in [[economics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Recent results on belief, knowledge and the epistemic foundations of game theory|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090944399901874|journal = Research in Economics|date = 1999-06-01|pages = 149–225|volume = 53|issue = 2|doi = 10.1006/reec.1999.0187|first = Pierpaolo|last = Battigalli|first2 = Giacomo|last2 = Bonanno}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[artificial intelligence]] and [[theoretical computer science]] &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Reasoning about Knowledge|author1=Ronald Fagin |author2=Joseph Halpern |author3=Yoram Moses |author4=Moshe Vardi |publisher = MIT Press|year = 1995|isbn = 9780262562003|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where reasoning about knowledge is a central topic. Due to the new setting in which epistemic logic was used, new perspectives and new features such as [[Computability theory|computability]] issues were then added to the research agenda of epistemic logic.

=== Syntax ===

In the sequel, &lt;math&gt;AGTS=\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set whose elements are called agents and &lt;math&gt;PROP&lt;/math&gt; is a set of propositional letters.

The epistemic language is an extension of the basic multi-modal language of [[modal logic]] with a [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] operator &lt;math&gt;C_{A}&lt;/math&gt; and a [[distributed knowledge]] operator &lt;math&gt;D_{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Formally, the '''epistemic language''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{\textsf{EL}}^{C}&lt;/math&gt; is defined inductively by the following [[Formal grammar|grammar]] in [[BNF grammar|BNF]]:

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{\textsf{EL}}^{C}:\phi~~::=~~ p~\mid~\neg\phi~\mid~(\phi\land\phi)~\mid~
K_j\phi~\mid~ C_{A}\phi ~\mid~  D_{A}\phi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p\in PROP&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j\in {AGTS}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq {AGTS}&lt;/math&gt;. The '''basic epistemic language''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{EL}&lt;/math&gt; is the language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{EL}^{C}&lt;/math&gt; without the common knowledge and distributed knowledge operators. The formula &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; is an abbreviation for &lt;math&gt;\neg p \land p&lt;/math&gt; (for a given &lt;math&gt;p\in PROP&lt;/math&gt;),  &lt;math&gt;\langle K_{j}\rangle\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an abbreviation for &lt;math&gt;\neg K_j\neg\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_{A}\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an abbreviation for &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge\limits_{j\in A} K_j\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C\phi&lt;/math&gt; an abbreviation for &lt;math&gt;C_{AGTS}\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Group notions: general, common and distributed knowledge.'''

In a multi-agent setting there are three important epistemic concepts: general knowledge, distributed knowledge and common knowledge. The notion of common knowledge was first studied by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|Lewis]] in the context of conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Convention, a Philosophical Study|last = Lewis|first = David|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 1969|isbn = 0674170253|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then applied to [[distributed systems]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  and to [[game theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Agreeing to Disagree|jstor = 2958591|journal = The Annals of Statistics|date = 1976-11-01|pages = 1236–1239|volume = 4|issue = 6|first = Robert J.|last = Aumann|doi=10.1214/aos/1176343654}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it allows to express that the rationality of the players, the rules of the game and the set of players are commonly known.

''General knowledge.''

General knowledge of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; means that everybody in the group of agents &lt;math&gt;{AGTS}&lt;/math&gt; knows that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Formally, this corresponds to the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;E\phi:=\underset{j\in {AGTS}}\bigwedge K_j\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

''Common knowledge.''

Common knowledge of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; means that everybody knows &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; but also that everybody knows that everybody knows &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, that everybody knows that everybody knows that everybody knows &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and so on ''ad infinitum''. Formally, this corresponds to the following formula

&lt;math&gt;C\phi:=E\phi\land E E\phi\land E E E\phi\land\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

As we do not allow infinite conjunction the notion of common knowledge will have to be introduced as a primitive in our language.

Before defining the language with this new operator, we are going to give an example introduced by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|Lewis]] that illustrates the difference between the notions of general knowledge and common knowledge. Lewis wanted to know what kind of knowledge is needed so that the statement &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;: “every driver must drive on the right” be a convention among a group of agents. In other words, he wanted to know what kind of knowledge is needed so that everybody feels safe to drive on the right. Suppose there are only two agents &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Then everybody knowing &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (formally &lt;math&gt;E p&lt;/math&gt;) is not enough. Indeed, it might still be possible that the agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; considers possible that the agent &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; does not know &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (formally &lt;math&gt;\neg K_i K_j p&lt;/math&gt;). In that case the agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; will not feel safe to drive on the right because he might consider that the agent &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, not knowing &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, could drive on the left. To avoid this problem, we could then assume that everybody knows that everybody knows that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (formally &lt;math&gt;E E p&lt;/math&gt;). This is again not enough to ensure that everybody feels safe to drive on the right. Indeed, it might still be possible that agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; considers possible that agent &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; considers possible that agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; does not know &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (formally &lt;math&gt;\neg K_i K_j K_i p&lt;/math&gt;). In that case and from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;’s point of view, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; considers possible that &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, not knowing &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, will drive on the left. So from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;’s point of view, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; might drive on the left as well (by the same argument as above). So &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; will not feel safe to drive on the right. Reasoning by induction, Lewis showed that for any &lt;math&gt;k\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E p\land E^1 p\land \ldots \land E^k p&lt;/math&gt; is not enough for the drivers to feel safe to drive on the right. In fact what we need is an infinite conjunction. In other words, we need common knowledge of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;C p&lt;/math&gt;.

''Distributed knowledge.''

Distributed knowledge of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; means that if the agents pulled their knowledge altogether, they would know that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds. In other words, the knowledge of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is ''distributed'' among the agents. The formula &lt;math&gt;D_{A}\phi&lt;/math&gt; reads as ‘it is distributed knowledge among the set of agents &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds’.

=== Semantics ===

Epistemic logic is a [[modal logic]]. So, what we call an '''epistemic model''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}=(W, R_1,\ldots, R_n,I)&lt;/math&gt; is just a [[Kripke model]] as defined in modal logic. The set &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty set whose elements are called ''possible worlds'' and the ''interpretation'' &lt;math&gt;I:W\rightarrow 2^{PROP}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] specifying which propositional facts (such as ‘Ann has the red card’) are true in each of these worlds. The ''accessibility relations'' &lt;math&gt;R_j\subseteq W\times W&lt;/math&gt; are [[binary relation]]s for each agent &lt;math&gt;j\in AGTS&lt;/math&gt;; they are intended to capture the uncertainty of each agent (about the actual world and about the other agents' uncertainty). Intuitively, we have &lt;math&gt;(w,v)\in R_j&lt;/math&gt; when the world &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with agent &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;’s information in world &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; or, in other words, when agent &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; considers that world &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; might correspond to the world &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; (from this standpoint). We abusively write &lt;math&gt;w\in\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;w\in W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_j(w)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of worlds &lt;math&gt;\{v\in W; (w,v)\in R_j\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Intuitively, a '''pointed epistemic model''' &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M},w)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;w\in\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, represents from an external point of view how the actual world &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is perceived by the agents &lt;math&gt;{AGTS}&lt;/math&gt;.

For every epistemic model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, every &lt;math&gt;w\in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;\phi\in\mathcal{L}_{\textsf{EL}}&lt;/math&gt;, we define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M},w\models\phi&lt;/math&gt; inductively by the following [[truth conditions]]:

Despite the fact that the notion of common belief has to be introduced as a primitive in the language, we can notice that the definition of epistemic models does not have to be modified in order to give truth value to the common knowledge and distributed knowledge operators.

'''Card Example:'''

Players &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; (standing for Ann, Bob and Claire) play a card game with three cards: a red one, a green one and a blue one. Each of them has a single card but they do not know the cards of the other players. Ann has the red card, Bob has the green card and Claire has the blue card. This example is depicted in the pointed epistemic model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M},w)
&lt;/math&gt; represented below. In this example, &lt;math&gt;AGTS:=\{A,B,C\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;PROP:=\{{\color{red}{A}},{\color{green}{B}},{\color{blue}{C}},{\color{red}{B}},{\color{green}{C}},{\color{blue}{A}},{\color{red}{C}},{\color{green}{A}},{\color{blue}{B}}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Each world is labelled by the propositional letters which are true in this world and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the actual world. There is an arrow indexed by agent &lt;math&gt;j\in\{A,B,C\}
&lt;/math&gt; from a possible world &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; to a possible world &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;(u,v)\in R_j&lt;/math&gt;. Reflexive arrows are omitted, which means that for all &lt;math&gt;j\in \{A,B,C\}&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;v\in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;(v,v)\in R_j&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:WikiDEL1b.png|frame|Card Example: pointed epistemic model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M},w)&lt;/math&gt;]]
&lt;math&gt;{\color{red}{A}}&lt;/math&gt; stands for : "&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has the red card&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{C}}&lt;/math&gt; stand for: "&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has the blue card&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\color{green}{B}}&lt;/math&gt; stands for: "&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; has the green card&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

and so on...

When accessibility relations are equivalence relations (like in this example) and we have that &lt;math&gt;(w,v)\in R_j&lt;/math&gt;, we say that agent &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; ''cannot distinguish'' world &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; from world &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (or world &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is indistinguishable from world &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; for agent &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;). So, for example, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; cannot distinguish the actual world &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; from the possible world where &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; has the blue card (&lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{B}}&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has the green card (&lt;math&gt;{\color{green}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; still has the red card (&lt;math&gt;{\color{red}{A}}&lt;/math&gt;).

In particular, the following statements hold:

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M},w\models({\color{red}{A}}\land K_A{\color{red}{A}})\land({\color{blue}{C}}\land K_C{\color{blue}{C}})\land ({\color{green}{B}}\land K_B{\color{green}{B}})&lt;/math&gt;

'All the agents know the color of their card'.

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M},w\models K_A({\color{blue}{B}}\vee{\color{green}{B}})\land K_A({\color{blue}{C}}\vee{\color{green}{C}})&lt;/math&gt;

'&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; knows that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; has either the blue or the green card and that &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has either the blue or the green card'.

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M},w\models E({\color{red}{A}}\vee{\color{blue}{A}}\vee{\color{green}{A}})\land C({\color{red}{A}}\vee{\color{blue}{A}}\vee{\color{green}{A}})&lt;/math&gt;

'Everybody knows that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has either the red, green or blue card and this is even common knowledge among all agents'.

=== Knowledge versus Belief ===
We use the same notation &lt;math&gt;K_j&lt;/math&gt; for both knowledge and belief. Hence, depending on the context, &lt;math&gt;K_j\phi&lt;/math&gt; will either read ‘the agent &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; ''K''nows that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds’ or ‘the agent &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; ''B''elieves that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds’. A crucial difference is that, unlike knowledge, beliefs can be ''wrong'': the axiom &lt;math&gt;K_j\phi\rightarrow \phi&lt;/math&gt; holds only for knowledge, but not necessarily for belief. This axiom called axiom T (for Truth) states that if the agent knows a proposition, then this proposition is true. It is often considered to be the hallmark of knowledge and it has not been subjected to any serious attack ever since its introduction in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]] by [[Plato]].

The notion of knowledge might comply to some other constraints (or axioms) such as &lt;math&gt;K_j\phi\rightarrow  K_j K_j\phi&lt;/math&gt;: if agent &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; knows something, she knows that she knows it. These constraints might affect the nature of the accessibility relations &lt;math&gt;R_j&lt;/math&gt; which may then comply to some extra properties. So, we are now going to define some particular classes of epistemic models that all add some extra constraints on the accessibility relations &lt;math&gt;R_j&lt;/math&gt;. These constraints are matched by particular axioms for the knowledge operator &lt;math&gt;K_j&lt;/math&gt;. Below each property, we give the axiom which ''defines''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modal Logic|author1=Patrick Blackburn |author2=Maarten de Rijke |author3=Yde Venema |publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0521527149|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the class of epistemic frames that fulfill this property. (&lt;math&gt;K\phi&lt;/math&gt; stands for &lt;math&gt;K_j\phi&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;j\in AGTS&lt;/math&gt;.)

We discuss the axioms above. Axiom 4 states that if the agent knows a proposition, then she knows that she knows it (this axiom is also known as the “KK-principle”or “KK-thesis”). In epistemology, axiom 4 tends to be accepted by [[internalists]], but not by [[externalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy  » KK Principle (Knowing that One Knows) Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy » Print|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/kk-princ/print/|website = www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axiom 4 is nevertheless widely accepted by computer scientists (but also by many philosophers, including [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], as [[Jaakko Hintikka|Hintikka]] recalls ). A more controversial axiom for the logic of knowledge is axiom 5 for Euclidicity: this axiom states that if the agent does not know a proposition, then she knows that she does not know it. Most philosophers (including Hintikka) have attacked this axiom, since numerous examples from everyday life seem to invalidate it.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;For example, assume that a university professor believes (is certain) that one of her colleague’s seminars is on Thursday (formally &lt;math&gt;B p&lt;/math&gt;). She is actually wrong because it is on Tuesday (&lt;math&gt;\neg p&lt;/math&gt;). Therefore, she does not know that her colleague’s seminar is on Tuesday (&lt;math&gt;\neg K p&lt;/math&gt;). If we assume that axiom is valid then we should conclude that she knows that she does not know that her colleague’s seminar is on Tuesday (&lt;math&gt;K \neg K p&lt;/math&gt;) (and therefore she also believes that she does not know it: &lt;math&gt;B\neg K p&lt;/math&gt;). This is obviously counterintuitive.
&lt;/ref&gt; In general, axiom 5 is invalidated when the agent has mistaken beliefs, which can be due for example to misperceptions, lies or other forms of deception. Axiom B states that it cannot be the case that the agent considers it possible that she knows a false proposition (that is, &lt;math&gt;\neg(\neg\phi\land\neg K\neg K\phi)&lt;/math&gt;). If we assume that axioms T and 4 are valid, then axiom B falls prey to the same attack as the one for axiom 5 since this axiom is derivable. Axiom D states that the agent’s beliefs are consistent. In combination with axiom K (where the knowledge operator is replaced by a belief operator), axiom D is in fact equivalent to a simpler axiom D' which conveys, maybe more explicitly, the fact that the agent’s beliefs cannot be inconsistent: &lt;math&gt;\neg B \bot&lt;/math&gt;. The other intricate axioms .2, .3, .3.2 and .4 have been introduced by epistemic logicians such as Lenzen and Kutchera in the 1970s&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and presented for some of them as key axioms of epistemic logic. They can be characterized in terms of intuitive interaction axioms relating knowledge and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Intricate Axioms as Interaction Axioms|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11225-015-9609-0|journal = Studia Logica|date = 2015-03-18|issn = 0039-3215|pages = 1035–1062|volume = 103|issue = 5|doi = 10.1007/s11225-015-9609-0|first = Guillaume|last = Aucher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Axiomatization ===

The Hilbert [[proof system]] K for the basic [[modal logic]] is defined by the following [[axiom]]s and [[inference rules]]: for all &lt;math&gt;j\in AGTS&lt;/math&gt;,

|+Proof system &lt;math&gt;\textsf{K}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{EL}&lt;/math&gt;

|-
|'''Nec'''
|If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;K_j\phi&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The axioms of an epistemic logic obviously display the way the agents reason. For example, the axiom K together with the rule of inference Nec entail that if I know &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;K\phi&lt;/math&gt;) and I know that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;  (&lt;math&gt;K(\phi\rightarrow \psi))&lt;/math&gt; then I know that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;K\psi&lt;/math&gt;). Stronger constraints can be added. The following  [[proof system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{\textsf{EL}}&lt;/math&gt; are often used in the literature.

We define the set of proof systems &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{L}_{\textsf{EL}}:=\{\textsf{K}, \textsf{KD45},\textsf{S4},\textsf{S4.2},\textsf{S4.3},\textsf{S4.3.2},\textsf{S4.4},\textsf{S5}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Moreover, for all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}\in\mathbb{L}_{\textsf{EL}}&lt;/math&gt;, we define the proof system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}^{\textsf{C}}&lt;/math&gt; by adding the following [[Axiom schema|axiom schemes]] and [[Rule of inference|rules of inference]] to those of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;. For all &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq AGTS&lt;/math&gt;,

The relative strength of the proof systems for knowledge is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\textsf{S4}\subset \textsf{S4.2}\subset \textsf{S4.3}\subset\textsf{S4.3.2}\subset\textsf{S4.4}\subset \textsf{S5}.&lt;/math&gt;

So, all the [[theorem]]s of &lt;math&gt;\textsf{S4.2}&lt;/math&gt; are also theorems of &lt;math&gt;\textsf{S4.3}, \textsf{S4.3.2}, \textsf{S4.4}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textsf{S5}&lt;/math&gt;. Many philosophers claim that in the most general cases, the logic of knowledge is &lt;math&gt;\textsf{S4.2}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\textsf{S4.3}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Epistemologische betrachtungen zu [S4, S5]|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00205012|journal = Erkenntnis|date = 1979-03-01|issn = 0165-0106|pages = 33–56|volume = 14|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/BF00205012|language = de|first = Wolfgang|last = Lenzen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On Logics of Knowledge and Belief|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-005-4062-y|journal = Philosophical Studies|date = 2006-03-01|issn = 0031-8116|pages = 169–199|volume = 128|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11098-005-4062-y|first = Robert|last = Stalnaker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, in computer science and in many of the theories developed in artificial intelligence, the logic of belief (''doxastic'' logic) is taken to be &lt;math&gt;\textsf{KD45}&lt;/math&gt; and the logic of knowledge (''epistemic'' logic) is taken to be &lt;math&gt;\textsf{S5}&lt;/math&gt;, even if &lt;math&gt;\textsf{S5}&lt;/math&gt; is only suitable for situations where the agents do not have mistaken beliefs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textsf{Br}&lt;/math&gt; has been propounded by Floridi as the logic of the notion of 'being informed’ which mainly differs from the logic of knowledge by the absence of introspection for the agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The logic of being informed|url = http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199232383.001.0001/acprof-9780199232383-chapter-10|pages = 224–243|doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199232383.003.0010|first = Luciano|last = Floridi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decidability and Complexity ===

The [[satisfiability problem]] for all the logics introduced is [[Decidable problem|decidable]]. We list below the [[Complexity class|computational complexity]] of the satisfiability problem for each of them. Note that it becomes linear in time if there are only finitely many propositional letters in the language. For &lt;math&gt;n\geq 2&lt;/math&gt;, if we restrict to finite nesting, then the satisfiability problem is [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]] for all the modal logics considered. If we then further restrict the language to having only finitely many primitive propositions, the complexity goes down to linear in time in all cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A guide to completeness and complexity for modal logics of knowledge and belief|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0004370292900494|journal = Artificial Intelligence|pages = 319–379|volume = 54|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/0004-3702(92)90049-4|first = Joseph Y.|last = Halpern|first2 = Yoram|last2 = Moses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The effect of bounding the number of primitive propositions and the depth of nesting on the complexity of modal logic|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000437029500018A|journal = Artificial Intelligence|date = 1995-06-01|pages = 361–372|volume = 75|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0004-3702(95)00018-A|first = Joseph Y.|last = Halpern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adding Dynamics ==

Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) is a logical framework for modeling epistemic situations involving several agents, and changes that occur to these situations as a result of  incoming information or more generally incoming action. The methodology of DEL is such that it splits the task of representing the agents’ beliefs and knowledge into three parts:

# One represents their beliefs about an initial situation thanks to an ''epistemic model'';
# One represents their beliefs about an event taking place in this situation thanks to an ''event model'';
# One represents the way the agents update their beliefs about the situation after (or during) the occurrence of the event thanks to a ''product update''.

Typically, an informative event can be a public announcement to all the agents of a formula &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;: this public announcement and correlative update constitute the dynamic part. However, epistemic events can be much more complex than simple public announcement, including hiding information for some of the agents, cheating, lying, bluffing, ''etc.'' This complexity is dealt with when we introduce the notion of event model. We will first focus on public announcements to get an intuition of the main underlying ideas of DEL.

=== Public Events ===

In this section, we assume that all events are public. We start by giving a concrete example where DEL can be used, to better understand what is going on. This example is called the [[muddy children puzzle]]. Then, we will present a formalization of this puzzle in a logic called [[Public Announcement Logic]] (PAL). The muddy children puzzle is one of the most well known puzzles that played a role in the development of DEL. Other significant puzzles include the [[Sum and Product Puzzle|sum and product puzzle]], the [[Monty Hall problem|Monty Hall dilemma]], the [[Russian cards problem]], the [[two envelopes problem]], [[Moore's paradox]], the [[hangman paradox]], ''etc''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= One Hundred Prisoners and a Light Bulb - Springer |url= https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-16694-0 |doi= 10.1007/978-3-319-16694-0 |first= Hans |last= van Ditmarsch |first2= Barteld |last2= Kooi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muddy Children Example:'''

We have two children, A and B, both dirty. A can see B but not himself, and B can see A but not herself. Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be the proposition stating that A is dirty, and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; be the proposition stating that B is dirty.

# We represent the initial situation by the pointed epistemic model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{N},s)&lt;/math&gt; represented below, where relations between worlds are equivalence relations. States &lt;math&gt;s,t,u,v&lt;/math&gt; intuitively represent possible worlds, a proposition (for example &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) satisfiable at one of these worlds intuitively means that in the corresponding possible world, the intuitive interpretation of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (A is dirty) is true. The links between worlds labelled by agents (A or B) intuitively express a notion of indistinguishability for the agent at stake between two possible worlds. For example, the link between &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; labelled by A intuitively means that A can not distinguish the possible world &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa. Indeed, A cannot see himself, so he cannot distinguish between a world where he is dirty and one where he is not dirty. However, he can distinguish between worlds where B is dirty or not because he can see B. With this intuitive interpretation we are brought to assume that our relations between worlds are equivalence relations.[[File:WikiDEL2b.png|centre|frame|Initial situation: pointed epistemic model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{N},s)&lt;/math&gt;]]
# Now, suppose that their father comes and announces that at least one is dirty (formally, &lt;math&gt;p\vee q&lt;/math&gt;). Then we update the model and this yields the pointed epistemic model represented below. What we actually do is suppressing the worlds where the content of the announcement is not fulfilled. In our case this is the world where &lt;math&gt;\neg p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg q&lt;/math&gt; are true. This suppression is what we call the update. We then get the model depicted below. As a result of the announcement, both A and B do know that at least one of them is dirty. We can read this from the epistemic model.[[File:WikiDEL3b.png|centre|frame|Updated epistemic model after the first announcement &lt;math&gt;p\vee q&lt;/math&gt;]]
# Now suppose there is a second (and final) announcement that says that neither knows they are dirty (an announcement can express facts about the situation as well as epistemic facts about the knowledge held by the agents). We then update similarly the model by suppressing the worlds which do not satisfy the content of the announcement, or equivalently by keeping the worlds which do satisfy the announcement. This update process thus yields the pointed epistemic model represented below. By interpreting this model, we get that A and B both know that they are dirty, which seems to contradict the content of the announcement. However, if we assume that A and B are both perfect reasoners and that this is common knowledge among them, then this inference makes perfect sense.
[[File:WikiDEL4b.png|centre|Updated epistemic model after the second announcement|frame]]

'''Public announcement logic (PAL):'''

We present the syntax and semantic of [[Public Announcement Logic]] (PAL), which combines features of epistemic logic and [[propositional dynamic logic]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dynamic Logic|author1=David Harel |author2=Dexter Kozen |author3=Jerzy Tiuryn |publisher = MIT Press|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0262082891|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

We define the '''language &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal{L}_{PAL}}&lt;/math&gt;''' inductively by the following [[Formal grammar|grammar]] in [[BNF grammar|BNF]]:

&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal{L}_{PAL}}:\phi~~::=~~  p~\mid~\neg\phi~\mid~(\phi\land\phi)~\mid~K_j\phi~\mid~[\phi!]\phi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;j\in AGTS&lt;/math&gt;.

The language '''&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal{L}_{PAL}}&lt;/math&gt;''' is interpreted over epistemic models. The [[truth conditions]] for the connectives of the epistemic language are the same as in epistemic logic (see above). The truth condition for the new dynamic action modality &lt;math&gt;[\psi!]\phi&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:
{|
|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M},w\models [\psi!]\phi&lt;/math&gt;
|iff
|&lt;math&gt; \mbox{if } \mathcal{M},w\models\psi\mbox{ then } \mathcal{M}^\psi,w\models\phi&lt;/math&gt;
|}
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^\psi:=(W^\psi,R_1^\psi,\ldots, R_n^\psi,I^\psi)&lt;/math&gt; with

&lt;math&gt;W^\psi:=\{w\in W; \mathcal{M},w\models\psi\}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;R_j^\psi:=R_j\cap (W^\psi\times W^\psi)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; and

&lt;math&gt;I^\psi(w):=I(w)\textrm{~for~all~} w\in W^{\psi}&lt;/math&gt;.

The formula &lt;math&gt;[\psi!]\phi&lt;/math&gt; intuitively means that after a truthful announcement of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds. A public announcement of a proposition &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; changes the current epistemic model like in the figure below.[[File:WikiDEL5b.png|centre|Eliminate all worlds which currently do not satisfy &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;|frame]]

The proof system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{PAL}&lt;/math&gt; defined below is [[Soundness|sound]] and [[Completeness (logic)|strongly complete]] for &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal{L}_{PAL}}&lt;/math&gt; w.r.t. the class of all pointed epistemic models.

The axioms Red 1 - Red 4 are called ''reduction axioms'' because they allow to reduce any formula of '''&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal{L}_{PAL}}&lt;/math&gt;''' to a provably equivalent formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{EL}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{PAL}&lt;/math&gt;. The formula &lt;math&gt;[q!]K q&lt;/math&gt; is a [[theorem]] provable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{PAL}&lt;/math&gt;. It states that after a public announcement of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, the agent knows that &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; holds.

PAL is [[Decidable problem|decidable]], its [[Model checking|model checking problem]] is solvable in [[polynomial time]] and its [[satisfiability problem]] is [[PSPACE-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Complexity and Succinctness of Public Announcement Logic|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1160633.1160657|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the Fifth International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems|date = 2006-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 1-59593-303-4|pages = 137–143|series = AAMAS '06|doi = 10.1145/1160633.1160657|first = Carsten|last = Lutz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muddy children puzzle formalized with PAL:'''

Here are some of the statements that hold in the muddy children puzzle formalized in PAL.

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N},s\models p\land q&lt;/math&gt;

'In the initial situation, A is dirty and B is dirty'.

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N},s\models(\neg K_Ap\land \neg K_A\neg p)\land (\neg K_B q \land\neg K_B\neg q)&lt;/math&gt;

'In the initial situation, A does not know whether he is dirty and B neither'.

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N},s\models[p\vee q!](K_A(p\vee q)\land K_B(p\vee q))&lt;/math&gt;

'After the public announcement that at least one of the children A and B is dirty, both of then know that at least one of them is dirty'. However:

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N},s\models[p\vee q!]((\neg K_Ap\land \neg K_A\neg p)\land (\neg K_B q \land\neg K_B\neg q))&lt;/math&gt;

'After the public announcement that at least one of the children A and B is dirty, they still do not know that they are dirty'. Moreover:

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N},s\models[p\vee q!][(\neg K_Ap\land \neg K_A\neg p)\land (\neg K_B q \land\neg K_B\neg q)!](K_A p\land K_B q)&lt;/math&gt;

'After the successive public announcements that at least one of the children A and B is dirty and that they still do not know whether they are dirty, A and B then both know that they are dirty'.

In this last statement, we see at work an interesting feature of the update process: a formula is not necessarily true after being announced. That is what we technically call “self-persistence” and this problem arises for epistemic formulas (unlike propositional formulas). One must not confuse the announcement and the update induced by this announcement, which might cancel some of the information encoded in the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Secret of My Success|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-005-3384-9|journal = Synthese|date = 2006-07-01|issn = 0039-7857|pages = 201–232|volume = 151|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s11229-005-3384-9|first = Hans Van|last = Ditmarsch|first2 = Barteld|last2 = Kooi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arbitrary Events ===

In this section, we assume that events are not necessarily public and we focus on items 2 and 3 above, namely on how to represent events and on how to update an epistemic model with such a representation of events by means of a product update.

==== Event Model ====

Epistemic models are used to model how agents perceive the actual world. Their perception can also be described in terms of knowledge and beliefs about the world and about the other agents’ beliefs. The insight of the DEL approach is that one can describe how an event is perceived by the agents in a very similar way. Indeed, the agents’ perception of an event can also be described in terms of knowledge and beliefs. For example, the private announcement of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; that her card is red can also be described in terms of knowledge and beliefs: while &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; tells &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; that her card is red (event &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; ''believes'' that nothing happens (event &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;). This leads to define the notion of event model whose definition is very similar to that of an epistemic model.

A pointed event model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{E},e)&lt;/math&gt; represents how the actual event represented by &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is perceived by the agents. Intuitively, &lt;math&gt;f\in R_j(e)&lt;/math&gt; means that while the possible event represented by &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is occurring, agent &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; considers possible that the possible event represented by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is actually occurring.

An '''event model''' is a tuple &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}=(W^\alpha,R_1^{\alpha},\ldots,R_m^{\alpha},I^{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt; where:

* &lt;math&gt;W^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty set of ''possible events'',
* &lt;math&gt;R_j^{\alpha}\subseteq W^\alpha\times W^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a binary relation called an ''accessibility relation'' on &lt;math&gt;W^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, for each &lt;math&gt;j\in AGTS&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;I^{\alpha}:W^{\alpha}\rightarrow  \mathcal{L}_{\textsf{EL}}&lt;/math&gt; is a function called the ''precondition function'' assigning to each possible event a formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{\textsf{EL}}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;R_j^{\alpha}(e)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set &lt;math&gt;\{f\in W^{\alpha};  (e,f)\in R_j^{\alpha} \}&lt;/math&gt; .We write &lt;math&gt;e\in \mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;e\in W^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{E},e)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''pointed event model''' (&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; often represents the actual event).

'''Card Example:'''

Let us resume the card example and assume that players &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; show their card to each other. As it turns out, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; noticed that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; showed her card to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; but did not notice that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; did so to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Players &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; know this. This event is represented below in the event model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{E},e)&lt;/math&gt;.

The possible event &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the actual event ‘players &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; show their and cards respectively to each other’ (with precondition &lt;math&gt;{\color{red}{A}}\land {\color{green}{B}}&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; stands for the event ‘player &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; shows her green card’ (with precondition &lt;math&gt;{\color{green}{A}}&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; stands for the atomic event ‘player &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; shows her red card’ (with precondition &lt;math&gt;{\color{red}{A}}&lt;/math&gt;). Players &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; show their cards to each other, players &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; know this and consider it possible, while player &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; considers possible that player &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; shows her red card and also considers possible that player &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; shows her green card, since he does not know her card. In fact, that is all that player &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; considers possible because she did not notice that &lt;math&gt;B
&lt;/math&gt; showed her card.

[[File:WikiDEL6b.png|centre|frame|Pointed event model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{E},e)&lt;/math&gt;: Players A and B show their cards to each other in front of player C]]

Another example of event model is given below. This second example corresponds to the event whereby Player &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; shows her red card publicly to everybody. Player &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; shows her red card, players &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; ‘know’ it, players &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; ‘know’ that each of them ‘knows’ it, ''etc.'' In other words, there is ''common knowledge'' among players &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; that player &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; shows her red card.

[[File:WikiDEL7b.png|centre|frame|Pointed event model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{F},e)&lt;/math&gt;]]

==== Product Update ====

The DEL product update is defined below.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Logic of Public Announcements and Common Knowledge and Private Suspicions|author1=Alexandru Baltag |author2=Lawrence S. Moss |author3=Slawomir Solecki |date = 1998|journal = Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK)|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This update yields a new pointed epistemic model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M},w)\otimes (\mathcal{E},e)&lt;/math&gt; representing how the new situation which was previously represented by &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M},w)&lt;/math&gt; is perceived by the agents after the occurrence of the event represented by &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{E},e)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}=(W,R_1,\ldots,R_n,I)&lt;/math&gt; be an epistemic model and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}=(W^{\alpha},R_1^{\alpha},\ldots,R_n^{\alpha},I^{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt; be an event model. The '''product update''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the epistemic model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\otimes\mathcal \mathcal{E}=(W^\otimes,R^\otimes_1,\ldots,R^{\otimes}_n,I^\otimes)&lt;/math&gt; defined as follows: for all &lt;math&gt;v\in W&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;f\in W^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,
{|
|&lt;math&gt;W^\otimes&lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt;\{(v,f)\in W\times W^\alpha; \mathcal{M},v\models I^{\alpha}(f)\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;R_j^\otimes(v,f)&lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt;\{(u,g)\in W^\otimes; u\in R_j(v)\textrm{~and~}g\in R^{\alpha}_j(f)\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;I^\otimes(v,f)&lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt;I(v)&lt;/math&gt;
|}
If &lt;math&gt;w\in W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e\in W^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; are such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M},w\models I^{\alpha}(e)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M},w)\otimes(\mathcal{E},e)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the pointed epistemic model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M}\otimes\mathcal{E},(w,e))&lt;/math&gt;. This definition of the product update is conceptually grounded.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Card Example:'''

As a result of the first event described above (Players &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; show their cards to each other in front of player &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;), the agents update their beliefs. We get the situation represented in the pointed epistemic model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M},w)\otimes(\mathcal{E},e)&lt;/math&gt; below. In this pointed epistemic model, the following statement holds: &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M},w)\otimes(\mathcal{E},e)\models ({\color{green}{B}}\land K_{A} {\color{green}{B}}) \land K_{C}\neg K_{A} {\color{green}{B}}.&lt;/math&gt; It states that player &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; knows that player &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; has the card but player &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; 'believes' that it is not the case.

[[File:WikiDEL8b.png|centre|frame|Updated pointed epistemic model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M},w)\otimes(\mathcal{E},e)&lt;/math&gt;]]The result of the second event is represented below. In this pointed epistemic model, the following statement holds: &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M},w)\otimes(\mathcal{F},e)\models C_{\{B,C\}}({\color{red}{A}}\land{\color{green}{B}}\land{\color{blue}{C}})\land  \neg K_A({\color{green}{B}}\land{\color{blue}{C}})&lt;/math&gt;. It states that there is common knowledge among &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; that they know the true state of the world (namely &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has the red card, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; has the green card and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has the blue card), but &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; does not know it.

[[File:WikiDEL9b.png|centre|frame|Updated pointed epistemic model &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{M},w)\otimes(\mathcal{F},e)&lt;/math&gt;]]

Based on these three components (epistemic model, event model and product update), Baltag, Moss and Solecki defined a general logical language inspired from the logical language of [[propositional dynamic logic]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; to reason about information and knowledge change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Erik Eriksen''' (25 February 1820  - died 1888) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] polar captain. Eriksen was the first to sight and shore [[Kong Karls Land]]. The strait [[Erik Eriksenstretet]]  between [[Kong Karls Land]] and [[Nordaustlandet]], commemorates him.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://placenames.npolar.no/stadnamn/Erik_Eriksenstretet | title = Erik Eriksenstretet (Svalbard) |publisher=[[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksen also contributed to the invention of the grenade [[harpoon]] used in modern whaling. 

==Biography==
Erik Eriksen was born at [[Lyngør]] in [[Aust-Agder]], [[Norway]]. In 1844, he moved to [[Hammerfest]] in [[Finnmark]], Norway. He sailed as a helmsman and from 1846 as skipper in the surrounding fishing grounds. He also married Anna Birgitte Dehle  (1825–1895) with whom he had 10 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polarhistorie.no/personer/Eriksen%2C%20Erik|title= Erik Eriksen 1820 – 1888|publisher= Norsk Polar Historie
|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later designed a whale harpoon which he carved into a wooden model. He subsequently travelled to [[Tønsberg]] to meet with whaling and shipping magnate [[Svend Foyn]] to present him with the model of a proposed grenade harpoon. In July 1868 Erik Eriksen emigrated to the United States leaving his wife and children in Norway. In 1870, Svend Foyn successfully patented and pioneered the modern exploding whaling harpoon and gun. He industrialized production and use of the deck cannons and heavy-caliber harpoons. Erik Eriksen gained neither profits nor the honor for his contribution as Foyn had financed production and development of the harpoon and it was designed while Eriksen was employed by him. However, Svend Foyn did provide financial assistance to Eriksen's family in Hammerfest.

==Early years==
Supilo was born in [[Cavtat]] on 30 November 1870.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cavtatportal.com/frano-supilo.html#.VXENNs9VhBc |title=Frano Supilo |date= |accessdate=2015-06-05 |quote=Frano Supilo, Croatian journalist and politician, was born in Cavtat on November 30, 1870. ... |publisher=[[Cavtat]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ersoy/&gt;&lt;ref name=pot&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Robert William Seton-Watson]] |coauthors= |title=Europe in the Melting-pot |year=1919 |publisher=[[Macmillan and Company]] |page=377 |quote=Frano Supilo was born in 1870 of poor parents at Cavtat (Eagusa Vecchia), on the coast of southern Dalmatia ...Supilo, then, at the age of barely twenty found himself in a subordinate position on the staff of the Crvena Hrvatska ... In 1900 a wealthy group of Croat merchants in Fiume decided to found a paper of their own ... and Supilo was selected as its first editor. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvOPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA377 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed elementary education in [[Dubrovnik]]. He had to drop out of naval high school because of a lack of funds, and instead finished a two-year school of agriculture with [[Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola|Frano Gondola]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Other references say he was expelled from school over his political activity when he protested during a state visit from [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria]] to Dubrovnik in 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled around [[Dalmatia]]n vineyards educating wine-growers on [[peronospora]].&lt;ref name="Perić1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivo Perić|title=Mladi Supilo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=25xpAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Školska knjiga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890 he started work at ''[[Crvena Hrvatska]]'' ('Red Croatia') in [[Dubrovnik]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=pot/&gt; It was a social/political paper based on the ideas of the [[Party of Rights (1861-1929)|Croatian Party of Rights]] and fighting for the unification of [[Dalmatia]] with [[Croatia]].

Supilo played the main role in changing the public opinion, which expressed itself in several elections that brought down the [[Autonomous Party]] (pro-Italian) and [[Serbs|Serbian]] coalition that had gained power in the municipality of Dubrovnik in the 1880s with the support of the [[Habsburg]] court, which followed the policy of ''[[divide et impera]]''. He became one of the leaders of the [[Party of Rights (1861-1929)|Croatian Party of Rights]] in 1895. After the party split, he campaigned against [[Josip Frank]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1900, he worked in Rijeka as the commissioner of the party's Dalmatian.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1900 he became the editor of ''[[Novi list]]'' in [[Rijeka]].&lt;ref name=pot/&gt;

==The Croato-Serb Coalition==
Along with [[Ante Trumbić]] and [[Josip Smodlaka]], he was one of the creators of both the [[Rijeka Resolution]]; and the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]], both in 1905.&lt;ref name=lib&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew P. Fitzpatrick |title=Liberal Imperialism in Europe |year= |publisher= |page=131 |quote=... the Dalmatian Croat Frano Supilo (1870–1917), who also urged political cooperation with anti-dualist Hungarian politicians (leading to the drafting of the so-called Rijeka Resolution in 1905 ...

Protheroe |title=Searching for Security in a New Europe |year= |publisher= |page=25 |quote=A second representative of 'new thought' in October 1914 was the Croat, Frano Supilo. ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DPOJSjsl-cC&amp;pg=PT25 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also responsible for the creation of the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]], as well as for its coming to power. Supilo's River and Zagreb faze have historically and continuously been analysed only when the studies and books have started to appear after the fall of [[SFRJ]] - that is because up until then his work has been continuously treated as a visionary activity towards his hearts agenda, and even back then in Yugoslavia (communistic), a serious dream of the creation of a united country of Croats and Serbs. A good example of the newest appreciation of Supilo's political activity is a series of shorter texts published in the magazine Kolo, 1998., nm. 8. In short notes - Supilo has taken the traditional right wing politics and made a radical turn based on two important entries: ideological and pragmatically - ideological.&lt;ref name="pot" /&gt;

On the major playground, Supilo becomes a supporter of a softer Yugoslavian unitarism (because of which he was often demonised in Croatian circles). Supilo's opinion (which was then shared by a large portion of Croatian and Serbian intelligence) had been that [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] (to which he later added [[Slovenes]] as well) are one three - tribal people - therefore, not three tribes, even less three nations, but one Yugoslavian nation with three names. That, from the modern perspective an unusual idea, was a sign of the late national crystallisation on the Croatian side (in less parts Serbs and Slovenes - not to mention [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and [[Montenegrins]]), as well as the territorial bubbles of Serbs and Croats, together with the fact Croatian and Serbian traditional languages have been exquisitely similar and inter - understandable on the conversational level. Practically, this has meant the creation of the Croato-Serb coalition, a creation by which the Serbs are recognised, de facto, as political people inside of Croatia, for the first time in history.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A much stronger change has been signified by the negotiations between the coalition and Supilo with the Hungarian and Italian politicians from [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]]. Post fester, that move can be considered as brave, innovative and - completely missed. Supilo has tried to convert traditional Croatian enemies into Croatian allies within the fight for universal democratisation of monarchy in which - according to his opinion - all nations would be winners.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; But he has made a mistake in his prognosis: the Italian and Hungarian imperialism was so strongly and deeply rooted into the consciences of the nationalistic elites of those people that only the world wars were able to crumble down those views.&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt;

When it comes to Serbian nationalism, Supilo did not in that period realistically understand the stubbornness and deflections of Serbian territorial agendas on practically the whole Bosnia and Hercegovina and Croatia. On the consequential elections in 1906.,&lt;ref&gt;Vaso Bogdanov, ''O životu i radu Frana Supila'', str. 9., u: ''Politika u Hrvatskoj'', (ur. i uvod, Vaso Bogdanov), Kultura, Zagreb, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; on which the Coalition has won, Supilo was chosen as a representative in the [[Croatian Parliament]]&lt;ref name="proleksis" /&gt; and became the leading person of the Coalition. When the Hungarian parliament in spring 1907. voted the Trainline Pragmati, in which the Hungarian language is voted as the official language on all train lines in Croatia, Supilo translated the Croatian disagreement to the Hungarian parliament and led a difficult campaign against the Hungarian ban [[Pavao Rauch|Pavlo Rauch]], and started to propose essential constitutional questions about the position of Croatia. His radical approach brings him into a conflict with the leadership of the Coalition, which wanted a more careful politic, in order not to lose the ability of returning to power.

Supilo was aiming for Croatia, with its own politics, to step up as the head of South Slaven Austro-Hungarian in the fight for their union - while the Serbian part of the Coalition was for appropriating the Croatian politics which he one of the Kingdom of Serbia, which in reality meant turning Croatia into a Serbian political appending.

His attitude struck a serious reaction in Austrian circles. Even though the deceits against him have subsequently been exposed, Supilo stepped out of the Coalition in order to ease its position; the Coalitions then agreed to a compromised way of solving conflict, which led to the fall of ban Rauch, as well as the fall of the Coalition pact with the unnamed ban Nikola Tomasevic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The coalition has since then, and up until the fall of monarchy and creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croatian and Slovenes (1918), fallen down on the weapon in hand of the most influential Croatian pragmatic politician of the time, unitarisation proponent [[Svetozar Pribićević|Svetozar Pribivecic]], whose primary goal was the wait of the fall of the monarchy and definite union with the Serbs. Supilo condemned the opportunistic politic of the Coalition leadership because he believed it was compromising Croatia and was not aiming for Croatia to be equal with Serbia in its fight for unity. In that he was right - the Pribicevic goal wasn’t for Croatia to be as such in the Yugoslavian country.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

==Unitarisation==
{{Original research section|date=June 2015}}
Ideologically, Supilo became the proponent of a [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[unitarisation]]. He helf that [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] (and later [[Slovenes]]) were a single people with three "tribes". This idea was shared by many of his contemporaries, based on the late national awakening of Croats, Serbs and Slovenes (not to mention [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Bosniaks]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]]), the territorial closeness of Serbs and Croats, and the facts that the two peoples have very similar official languages. In practice, it meant the creation of a coalition that virtually recognized Serbs as a political entity in Croatia for the first time in its history. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

An even stronger turn was the negotiation of the coalition and Supilo with the Hungarian and Italian politicians from [[Austria-Hungary]]. It was a brave and innovative move, but proved unsuccessful. Supilo played on the temporary conflict between the Vienna court and the Italian [[irredentism|irredentists]] and Hungarian imperialists, the traditional Croatian opponents who claimed their rights to some Croatian lands. He wanted to turn them into Croatian allies in the fight for the general democratization of the monarchy, which he believed would profit all peoples. But he estimated wrongly: the Italian and Hungarian imperialism was so deeply entrenched that it fell only after the world wars. As for Serbian nationalism, Supilo did not realize how stubborn were Serbian territorial claims over large parts of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

When the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]] won the elections of 1906, Supilo became a representative in the [[Croatian Parliament|Croatian parliament]] and the leading figure of the Coalition. When the Hungarian parliament in spring 1907 decided that Hungarian would be the official language of the Croatian railroads, Supilo led the Croatian opposition in obstructing actions in the Hungarian parliament. He waged a strong campaign against the [[Ban (title)|ban]] [[Levin Rauch]], who supported the Hungarians. Supilo also initiated the fundamental constitutional issues on the status of Croatia. His radical attitude brought him in conflict with the Coalition leadership, which promoted a more careful policy with a view of another mandate. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Supilo tried to bring Croatian policy to the forefront of the South Slavs of Austria-Hungary in their fight for unification, while the Serbian part of the Coalition and some of its Croatian members wanted to harmonize Croatian policy with the Kingdom of [[Serbia]], which would bring Croatia to a politically inferior position in relation to Serbia. At the time of the "High Treason Trial" (1909), the politically motivated trial against the Serb public officials in the monarchy, initiated by the Viennese court because of the crisis around the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908, Supilo advocated a strong support of Croats to the endangered Serbs to preserve the harmony of Croats and Serbs based on the principles from the Rijeka Resolution and the [[Zadar Resolution]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Heinrich Friedjung]] tried to discredit Supilo by forging documents that said Supilo was working on behalf of Serbia. [[Thomas Masaryk]] proved they were forgeries at a trial in 1909.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Supilo left the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]] in 1910.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=lib/&gt;

==World War I==
After the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], he fled to [[Florence, Italy]] where on 22 November 1914 he formed the [[Yugoslav Committee]] with [[Ante Trumbić]] and [[Ivan Meštrović]] to lobby for independence from [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John R. Lampe]] |coauthors= |title=Yugoslavia as History: Twice There Was a Country |year=2000 |publisher= |page= 103 |quote=Frano Supilo and Ante Trumbic, had agreed by 1913 that if war came they would organize abroad for the destruction of Austro-Hungarian rule. ...

==Death==
While in exile in London he had a [[nervous breakdown]] and was committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]].

The 2002 [[Women's Health Initiative]] (WHI) of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) found disparate results for all cause mortality with HRT, finding it to be lower when HRT was begun earlier, between age 50 to 59, but higher when begun after age 60. In older patients, there was an increased incidence of [[breast cancer]], [[heart attack]]s and [[stroke]], although a reduced incidence of [[colorectal cancer]] and [[bone fracture]].&lt;ref name="JAMA"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/288/3/321 | author = Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative Investigators | title = Risks and Benefits of Estrogen Plus Progestin in Healthy Postmenopausal Women: Principal Results From the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Trial | pmid = 12117397 | journal = [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] | year = 2002 | volume = 288 | pages = 321–333 | doi = 10.1001/jama.288.3.321 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the WHI findings were again found in a larger national study done in the [[United Kingdom]], known as the [[Million Women Study]] (MWS).

==Medical uses==
HRT is used to treat or prevent [[menopausal symptoms]] in [[menopause|postmenopausal]], [[perimenopause|perimenopausal]], and [[oophorectomy|surgically menopausal]] women, including the following:&lt;ref name="pmid26444994"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stuenkel CA, Davis SR, Gompel A, Lumsden MA, Murad MH, Pinkerton JV, Santen RJ | title = Treatment of Symptoms of the Menopause: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline | journal = J.

* [[Hot flash]]es (vasomotor symptoms)
* [[Vulvovaginal atrophy]] (atrophic vaginitis; including [[vaginal dryness]])
* [[Dyspareunia]] (painful sexual intercourse, due to vaginal atrophy and lack of [[vaginal lubrication]])
* Bone loss (decreased [[bone mineral density]], which can eventually lead to [[osteopenia]], [[osteoporosis]], and associated [[bone fracture]]s)
* [[Decreased sexual desire]]
* [[Defeminization]] (e.g., diminished [[gynoid fat distribution|feminine fat distribution]], worsened [[skin]] appearance and accelerated [[skin aging]])&lt;ref name="pmid12762829"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raine-Fenning NJ, Brincat MP, Muscat-Baron Y | title = Skin aging and menopause : implications for treatment | journal = Am J Clin Dermatol | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 371–8 | date = 2003 | pmid = 12762829 | doi = 10.2165/00128071-200304060-00001 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22533363"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zouboulis CC, Makrantonaki E | title = Hormonal therapy of intrinsic aging | journal = Rejuvenation Res | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 302–12 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22533363 | doi = 10.1089/rej.2011.1249 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Additional symptoms such as [[sleep disturbance]]s, [[arthralgia|joint pain]], and possibly others

It is also used for health benefits, such as reduced risk of [[dementia]], [[colorectal cancer]], [[endometrial cancer]], and others. However, this may be counterbalanced by various health risks, like an increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[breast cancer]].

HRT is often given as a short-term relief (often one or two years, usually less than five) from menopausal symptoms (such as hot flashes, [[irregular menstruation]]). Such treatments aren't usually recommended to women who are perimenopausal or for at least 12 months after the last menstrual period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menopause treatments|publisher=NHS|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/menopause/treatment/|accessdate=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger women with [[premature ovarian failure]] or [[oophorectomy|surgical menopause]] may use HRT for many years, until the age that natural menopause would be expected to occur.

===Available forms===
{{See also|Sex-hormonal agent|List of sex-hormonal medications available in the United States}}

There are several different types of [[sex-hormonal agent|hormonal medication]]s which are used in HRT for menopausal symptoms:&lt;ref name="pmid16112947"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhl H | title = Pharmacology of estrogens and progestogens: influence of different routes of administration | journal = Climacteric | volume = 8 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = 3–63 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16112947 | doi = 10.1080/13697130500148875 | url = http://hormonebalance.org/images/documents/Kuhl%2005%20%20Pharm%20Estro%20Progest%20Climacteric_1313155660.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tibolone]] is a unique medication which has the properties of an estrogen, progestogen, and androgen all in one molecule.&lt;ref name="pmid16112947" /&gt;

The medications used in menopausal HRT are available in numerous different [[pharmaceutical formulation|formulation]]s for use by a variety of different [[routes of administration]]:&lt;ref name="pmid16112947" /&gt;

* [[Oral administration]] ([[tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]]s, [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]]s)
* [[Transdermal administration]] ([[transdermal patch|patch]]es, [[transdermal gel|gel]]s, [[cream (pharmacy)|cream]]s)
* [[Vaginal administration]] (tablets, creams, [[suppository|suppositories]], [[vaginal ring|ring]]s)
* [[Intramuscular injection|Intramuscular]] or [[subcutaneous injection]] ([[solution]]s in [[vial]]s or [[ampoule]]s)
* [[Subcutaneous implant]] ([[surgery|surgically-inserted]] pellets placed into [[adipose tissue|fat tissue]])
* Other less common routes like [[sublingual administration|sublingual]], [[buccal administration|buccal]], [[intranasal administration|intranasal]], and [[rectal administration]], as well as [[intrauterine device]]s

HRT for menopause generally provides low dosages of one or more estrogens, and usually also provides a progestogen. In women with intact [[uterus]]es, estrogens are almost always given in combination with progestogens, as long-term unopposed estrogen therapy is associated with a markedly increased risk of [[endometrial hyperplasia]] and [[endometrial cancer]].&lt;ref name="pmid16112947" /&gt; Conversely, in women who have undergone a [[hysterectomy]] or who otherwise do not have a uterus, a progestogen is not necessarily required, and an estrogen can be used alone if preferred. There are many [[combination drug|combined formulation]]s which include both an estrogen and a progestogen. Examples include the [[conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate|combination of CEEs and MPA]] (brand name Prempro), as well as the combination of estradiol with one of various progestins such as norethisterone (in Activelle, Novofem, Cliovelle), MPA (in Indivina), [[levonorgestrel]], [[dienogest]], and [[drospirenone]], among others.

Dosage is often varied cyclically to more closely mimic the ovarian hormone cycle, with estrogens taken daily and progestogens taken for about two weeks every month or two; a method called "cyclic HRT" or "sequentially combined HRT" (abbreviated scHRT). An alternate method, a constant dosage with both types of hormones taken daily, is called "continuous combined HRT" or ccHRT, and is a more recent innovation. [[Vaginal estrogen]] can have more effect on [[atrophic vaginitis]] with fewer systemic effects than estrogens delivered by other routes.&lt;ref name=mayo2011&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR602127 Estrogen (Vaginal Route)] from Mayo Clinic / Thomson Healthcare Inc. Portions of this document last updated: Nov. 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes an androgen, generally testosterone, is added to treat diminished [[libido]]. It may also treat reduced energy and help reduce osteoporosis after menopause.

====Bioidentical hormone therapy====
{{Main article|Bioidentical hormone therapy}}

[[Bioidentical hormone therapy]] (BHT) is the use of hormones that are chemically identical to those produced in a woman's body. Proponents of BHT claim that it can offer advantages over non-bioidentical or conventional hormone therapy (CHT).&lt;ref name="pmid21464264" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17627398" /&gt; There are two different meanings to BHT as a term and therapy, which has resulted in some confusion. While both deal with the use of bioidentical hormones, one meaning concerns the specific use of certain [[compounding|compounded]] hormone preparations, usually in conjunction with [[blood test|blood]] or [[saliva testing]] to determine, and adjust, a woman's hormone levels; whereas the other meaning simply refers to the use of bioidentical hormones in general, but most typically as approved pharmaceutical preparations.&lt;ref name="pmid21464264" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28509626" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28301216" /&gt; The practices associated with the first meaning are not widely accepted in clinical medicine. Compounded BHT, including custom-compounded products like BiEst (20% estradiol and 80% estriol) and TriEst (10% estradiol, 10% estrone, and 80% estriol), has not demonstrated any benefits over CHT, and presents risks of uncertain dosing, potency, and possible contamination.&lt;ref name="pmid21464264" /&gt; In addition, blood or saliva testing is of limited utility due to natural fluctuations in hormone levels, and lack of consensus for ideal dosage in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid15167316" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21464264" /&gt; As such, the evidence and scientific literature do not support the use of compounded BHT, with or without hormone-level testing, over CHT.&lt;ref name="pmid15167316"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boothby LA, Doering PL, Kipersztok S | title = Bioidentical hormone therapy: a review | journal = Menopause | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 356–67 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15167316 | doi = 10.1097/01.GME.0000094356.92081.EF | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17627398"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cirigliano M | title = Bioidentical hormone therapy: a review of the evidence | journal = J Womens Health (Larchmt) | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 600–31 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17627398 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.2006.0311 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19072518"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sites CK | title = Bioidentical hormones for menopausal therapy | journal = Womens Health (Lond) | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–71 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 19072518 | doi = 10.2217/17455057.4.2.163 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25111856"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davis R, Batur P, Thacker HL | title = Risks and effectiveness of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: a case series | journal = J Womens Health (Larchmt) | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 642–8 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25111856 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.2014.4770 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28509626"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = L'Hermite M | title = Custom-compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: why so popular despite potential harm?

Institutions and organizations such as the FDA have taken public stances on compounded BHT. The FDA has stated that compounded BHT is unsupported by medical evidence, and its administration is considered false and misleading by the agency. The FDA has expressed concern that unfounded claims of compounded hormones having advantages over CHT mislead women and health care professionals. The approved pharmaceutical preparations used in conventional therapy have been researched to quantify these risks and benefits, and are produced by manufacturers with stringent purity and potency standards.&lt;ref name="FDA2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2008/ucm116832.htm | title = FDA Takes Action Against Compounded Menopause Hormone Therapy Drugs | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] | date = 2008-01-09 | accessdate = 2009-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounding in the United Kingdom is a regulated activity. The [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) regulates compounding performed under a Manufacturing Specials license and the [[General Pharmaceutical Council]] (GPhC) regulates compounding performed within a pharmacy. All testosterone prescribed in the [[United Kingdom]] is bioidentical and its use is supported by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). Marketing authorization exists for male testosterone products. [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) guideline 1.4.8 states: "consider testosterone supplementation for menopausal women with low sexual desire if HRT alone is not effective". The footnote adds: "at the time of publication (November 2015), testosterone did not have a United Kingdom marketing authorisation for this indication in women. Bio-identical progesterone is used in IVF treatment and for pregnant women who are at risk of premature labour."

==Contraindications==

===Absolute contraindications===
* Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding
* Severe [[liver disease]]
* [[Pregnancy]]

In 2002 the WHI was published. That study looked at the effects of hormonal replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. Both age groups had a slightly higher incidence of [[breast cancer]], and both [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]] were increased in older patients, although not in younger participants. In fact, the use of HRT in the United States has actually dropped greatly since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hormone therapy for brain performance: No effect, whether started early or late|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/07/160720215141.htm|website=www.sciencedaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breast cancer was increased in women treated with estrogen and a progestin, but not with estrogen and progesterone or estrogen alone.&lt;ref name="pmid27898258"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang Z, Hu Y, Zhang J, Xu L, Zeng R, Kang D | title = Estradiol therapy and breast cancer risk in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Gynecol.

These recommendations have not held up with further data analysis, however. Subsequent findings released by the WHI showed that all cause mortality was not dramatically different between the groups receiving CEEs, those receiving estrogen and a progestogen, and those not on HRT at all. Specifically, the [[relative risk]] for all-cause mortality was 1.04 ([[confidence interval]] 0.88–1.22) in the CEEs-alone trial and 1.00 (CI, 0.83–1.19) in the estrogen plus progestogen trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rossouw | first1 = J.

However, neither the WHI nor the MWS differentiated the results for different types of progestogens used. MPA – the type most commonly used in the United States – was the only one examined by the WHI, which in its analysis and conclusions extrapolated the benefits versus risks of MPA to all progestins. This conclusion has since been challenged by several researchers as unjustified and misleading, resulting in unreasonable, unnecessary avoidance by many women of HRT. In fact, primate research indicates that the side effects of MPA may be worse than those of other progestogens, and some human studies indicate that MPA may be responsible for negating the protective cardiac benefits of estrogen that were found for estrogen-only HRT users. Critics including Bethea note that there are now research papers showing significantly better outcomes in brain, breast, and cardiovascular parameters with estradiol plus progesterone instead of MPA and conclude that further studies are needed to know more precisely what the differences in effects are when other progestins are used versus bioidentical progesterone in HRT, so that women aren't needlessly discouraged from seeking HRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bethea CL | title = MPA: Medroxy-Progesterone Acetate Contributes to Much Poor Advice for Women | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 152 | issue = 2 | pages = 343–345 | date = Feb 2011 | doi = 10.1210/en.2010-1376 | pmc=3037166 | pmid=21252179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harman SM, Brinton EA, Cedars M, Lobo R, Manson JE, Merriam GR, Miller VM, Naftolin F, Santoro N | title = KEEPS: The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study | journal = Climacteric | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15804727 | doi=10.1080/13697130500042417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Langer RD | title = On the need to clarify and disseminate contemporary knowledge of hormone therapy initiated near menopause | journal = Climacteric | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–6 | date = August 2010 | doi = 10.3109/13697137.2010.496316 | pmid = 20540591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Studd J | title = Ten reasons to be happy about hormone replacement therapy: a guide for patients | journal = Menopause Int. | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–6 | date = March 2010 | doi = 10.1258/mi.2010.010001 | pmid = 20424287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beneficial potential of HRT was bolstered in a consensus expert opinion published by [[The Endocrine Society]], which stated that when taken during perimenopause or the initial years of menopause, hormonal therapy carries significantly fewer risks than previously published and reduces all cause mortality in most patient scenarios.&lt;ref name="endocrine"/&gt; The AACE released a position statement in 2009 that approved of HRT in the appropriate clinical scenario.

Proprietary mixtures of progestins and CEEs are a commonly prescribed form of HRT. As the most common and longest-prescribed type of estrogen used in HRT, most studies of HRT involve CEEs. More recently developed forms of drug delivery include suppositories, subdermal implants, skin patches and gels. They have more local effect, lower doses, fewer side effects, and result in constant rather than cyclical serum hormone levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fraser IS, Mansour D |title=Delivery systems for hormone replacement therapy |journal=Expert Opin Drug Deliv |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=191–204 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16506947 |doi=10.1517/17425247.3.2.191 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual dysfunction===
{{See also|Testosterone (medication)#Women}}

Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from loss of ovarian follicular activity.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Menopause can be divided into early and late transition periods, also known as perimenopause and postmenopause. Each stage is marked by changes in hormonal patterns, which can induce menopausal symptoms.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; It is possible to induce menopause prematurely by surgically removing the ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy). This is often done as a consequence of ovarian failure, such as ovarian or uterine cancers. The most common side effects of the menopausal transition are: lack of sexual desire or libido, lack of sexual arousal, and vaginal dryness.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; The modification of women’s physiology can lead to changes in her sexual response, the development of sexual dysfunctions, and changes in her levels of sexual desire.&lt;ref name= "sarrel"&gt;Sarrel, P.M. (2000). Effects of hormone replacement therapy on sexual psychophysiology and behavior in postmenopause. Journal of Women’s Health and Gender-Based Medicine, 9, 25-32&lt;/ref&gt;

It is commonly perceived that once women near the end of their reproductive years and enter menopause that this equates to the end of her sexual life.&lt;ref name="eden" /&gt; However, especially since women today are living one third or more of their lives in a postmenopausal state, maintaining, if not improving, their quality of life, of which their sexuality can be a key determinant, is of importance.&lt;ref name= "miller"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Miller M.M. |author2=Franklin K.B.J. | year = 1999 | title = Theoretical basis for the benefit of postmenopausal estrogen substitution | url = | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 34 | issue = 5| pages = 587–604 | doi = 10.1016/S0531-5565(99)00032-7 |pmid=10530785 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study of sexual activities among women aged 40–69 revealed that 75% of women are sexually active at this age; this indicates that the sexual health and satisfaction of menopausal women are an aspect of sexual health and quality of life that is worthy of attention by health care professionals.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt;

A major complaint among postmenopausal women is decreased libido, and many may seek medical consultation for this.&lt;ref name="ziaei"/&gt; Several hormonal changes take place during the menopausal period, including a decrease in estrogen levels and an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone. For most women, the majority of change occurs during the late perimenopausal and postmenopausal stages.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Decrease in other hormones such as the sex hormone-binding globulim (SHBG) and inhibin (A and B) also take place in the postmenopausal period. Testosterone, a hormone more commonly associated with males, is also present in women. It peaks at age 30, but declines with age, so there is little variation across the lifetime and during the menopausal transition.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; However, in surgically induced menopause, instead of the levels of estrogens and testosterone slowly declining over time, they decline very sharply, resulting in more severe symptoms.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt;

In menopausal women, sexual functioning can impact several dimensions of a woman’s life, including her physical, psychological, and mental well-being.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez"&gt;Gonzalez, M., Viagara, G., Caba, F., &amp; Molina, E. (2004). Sexual function, menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The European Menopause Journal, 48, 411-420. {{DOI|10.1016/j.maturitas.2003.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the onset of menopause, sexuality can be a critical issue in determining whether one begins to experience changes in their sexual response cycle.&lt;ref name="nappi"&gt;Nappi, R.E. et al., (2006). Clitoral stimulation in postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction: A pilot randomized study with hormone therapy. European Menopause Journal, 55, 288-295&lt;/ref&gt; Both age — and menopause-related events can affect the integrity of a woman’s biological systems involved in the sexual response cycle, which include hormone environment, neuro-muscular substrates, and vascular supplies.&lt;ref name="nappi" /&gt; Therefore, it can be appropriate to make use of HRT, especially in women with low or declining quality of life due to sexual difficulties.&lt;ref name="ziaei" /&gt;

Current research that has examined the impact of menopause on women’s self-reported sexual satisfaction indicates that 50.3% of women experience some sexual disturbance in one of five domains, and 33.7% experience disturbances in two of the domains.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez" /&gt; Of these were desire, orgasm, lubrication, and arousal disturbances. With regards to arousal, they found a significant negative association between age and arousal, in that as women aged they were more likely to report lower arousal scores. In the desire and orgasm domains, 38% of women reported a disturbances in their desire, and 17% reported a disturbance in their orgasm capabilities; of the 17%, 14% were premenopausal, 15.2% were postmenopausal and taking a form of HRT, and 22% were postmenopausal not on a form of HRT.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez" /&gt; Eight percent of women reported disturbances lubricating during sexual activity; 14.3% in the premenopausal group, 30% in the postmenopausal group not using a HRT, and 11.7% among those postmenopausal women using HRT.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez" /&gt; Lastly, 21% of women reported pain as a disturbance in their sexual satisfaction — the premenopausal group at 14.3%, the postmenopausal women using HRT at 13.3% and the group with the highest rates, similarly to the other results, was the postmenopausal women not taking HRT at 34%.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez" /&gt; This study concluded that there was a significant decline in sexual function related to menopause in the pain and lubrication domains.&lt;ref name= "gonzalez"/&gt;

The maintenance and improvement of quality of life during the menopausal period is at the core of estrogen and progestogen-based HRT.&lt;ref name= "ziaei" /&gt; Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) have been shown to enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties.&lt;ref name= "sarrel" /&gt; ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which deterioration are associated with the onset of menopause. [[Dyspareunia]] (due to vaginal dryness) appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT.&lt;ref name="sarrel" /&gt; It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity.&lt;ref name= "sarrel" /&gt; Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, fantasies, and frequency of coitus and orgasm have also been noted.&lt;ref name="sarrel" /&gt; However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use.&lt;ref name= "sarrel" /&gt; A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone.&lt;ref name= "sarrel" /&gt; Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called tibolone — a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties — suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, and somatic symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed.&lt;ref name= "ziaei" /&gt; However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.&lt;ref name= "ziaei" /&gt;

The goal of HRT is to mitigate discomfort caused by diminished circulating estradiol and progesterone in menopause. In those with premature or surgically induced menopause, a combination HRT is often recommended, as it may also prolong life and may decrease a woman's chances of developing endometrial cancers associated with unopposed estrogen therapy, as well by decreasing the incidence of dementia.&lt;ref name="Maturitas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eden"/&gt; The main hormones involved are estrogens and progestogens. Some recent therapies include the use of androgens as well.&lt;ref name="ziaei"/&gt;

Data from numerous studies have consistently found that HRT leads to improvements in aspects of postmenopausal sexual dysfunction.&lt;ref name="ziaei" /&gt; Sexuality is a critical aspect of quality of life for the large majority of menopausal women; therefore, any features of the menopausal transition that can negatively affect a woman’s sexuality have the ability to significantly alter her quality of life. The most prevalent of female sexual dysfunctions linked to menopause include lack of desire and low libido, both of which can be explained by changes in hormonal physiology.&lt;ref name= "eden"/&gt;

Improvements in sexual pain, [[vaginal lubrication]] and [[orgasm]] are found to be statistically different from those using HRT.&lt;ref name= "eden" /&gt; Estrogens have positive effects of mood, sexual function, target end organs, and cognitive function.

===Venous and arterial coagulation===
[[Image:Great saphenous vein thrombosis 05091312009.jpg|thumb|left|Clot in the greater [[Great saphenous vein|saphenous vein]]; oral HRT is associated with increased risk of venous clot due to increased hepatic synthesis of [[Vitamin K]] dependent clotting factors.]]

Comparisons between orally administered pill and [[transdermal patch]] suggests that when estrogens are taken orally the risks of [[thrombophlebitis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]] are increased, an effect which is not seen with topical administration. Transdermal and transvaginal administration are not subject to [[first pass metabolism]], and so lack the anabolic effects that oral therapy has on hepatic synthesis of [[Vitamin K]] dependent [[clotting factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Olié | first1 = V.

===Cardiovascular effects===
The impact of HRT on cardiovascular morbidity is a subject of much controversy in the medical literature. The reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with HRT, reported in observational studies, has not been subsequently confirmed in randomized clinical trials. The increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the WHI was not statistically significant, and only found in the oldest women, and those who started HRT late after menopause began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stramba-Badiale | first1 = M. | title = Postmenopausal hormone therapy and the risk of cardiovascular disease | doi = 10.2459/JCM.0b013e328324991c | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–309 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19430340 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in risks of [[coronary disease|coronary heart disease]] in the treatment arm of the study varied according to age and years since onset of menopause.

A [[Cochrane review]] came to the result that in women starting HRT less than 10 years after menopause have a lower mortality and lower rate of [[coronary heart disease]] compared to placebo or no treatment, without any strong evidence of an effect on the risk of stroke. Those starting therapy more than 10 years after menopause have little effect on mortality and coronary heart disease, but have an increased risk of stroke. Overall, however, taking the increased risk of [[venous thromboembolism]] into account, it came to the conclusion that has HRT has little if any benefit for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="BoardmanHartley2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boardman|first1=Henry MP|last2=Hartley|first2=Louise|last3=Eisinga|first3=Anne|last4=Main|first4=Caroline|last5=Roqué i Figuls|first5=Marta|last6=Bonfill Cosp|first6=Xavier|last7=Gabriel Sanchez|first7=Rafael|last8=Knight|first8=Beatrice|last9=Boardman|first9=Henry MP|title=Hormone therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women|year=2015|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002229.pub4|journal=Reviews|pmid=25754617|pages=CD002229|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adverse cardiovascular outcomes may only apply to oral dosing with CEEs and progestins in oral systemic therapy, while [[transdermal administration|transdermal]] [[estradiol (medication)|estradiol]] and [[estriol (medication)|estriol]] may not produce the same risks, due to the absence of anabolic effects of hepatic vitamin K dependent clotting factors.&lt;ref name="Scarabin PY, Oger E, Plu-Bureau G 2003 428–32"/&gt;

On a molecular level, HRT at the time of menopause has effects on the [[lipid profile]]. Specifically, [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]] decreases, while [[Low density lipoprotein|LDL]], [[triglyceride]]s and [[lipoprotein a]] increase. Supplemental estrogen improves the lipid profile by reversing each of these effects. Beyond this, it improves cardiac contractility, coronary artery blood flow, metabolism of carbohydrates, and decreases platelet aggregation and plaque formation. At the molecular level HRT may promote [[reverse cholesterol transport]] (RCT) via the induction of [[cholesterol]] [[ABC transporters]].&lt;ref name="pmid20807164"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Darabi | first1 = M. | last2 = Rabbani | first2 = M. | last3 = Ani | first3 = M. | last4 = Zarean | first4 = E. | last5 = Panjehpour | first5 = M. | last6 = Movahedian | first6 = A. | doi = 10.3109/09513590.2010.507826 | title = Increased leukocyte ABCA1 gene expression in post-menopausal women on hormone replacement therapy | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 701–705 | year = 2011 | pmid = 20807164 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endometrial effects===
[[Image:Endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma low mag.jpg|thumb|right|Endometrial tumor on histology. Most commonly, the tumor is ''in situ'' with minimal morbidity; patients still have lower all-cause [[mortality rate|mortality]] than those not on HRT.]]

While combined estrogen–progestogen supplementation has been linked to an increased incidence of endometrial cancer, the specific subtype is usually stage I, or ''in situ'', and has extremely low morbidity and mortality, and studies in American women have shown the tumor to not have propensity for growth into the myometrium or parametrial soft tissues. When seen in the context of all cause mortality, women who take estrogen and develop endometrial cancer have higher survival rates than women who do not take hormonal therapy at all, which was due to the preventive effect of HRT on hip fractures.

Unopposed estrogen can also result in [[endometrial hyperplasia]], a precursor to [[endometrial cancer]]. The extensive use of high-dose estrogens for [[birth control]] in the 1970s is thought to have resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of this type of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Young, Robert |author2=Arlan F., Jr Fuller |author3=Fuller, Arlan F. |author4=Michael V.

===Neurologic effects===
According to a 2007 presentation at an [[American Academy of Neurology]] meeting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18440238 | title=Hormones may ward off dementia in women: Controversial treatment effective when taken soon after menopause| publisher=Associated Press | author=Jeff Donn | date = 2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRT taken soon after menopause may help protect against dementia, but it raises the risk of mental decline in women who do not take HRT until they are older. Dementia risk was 1% in women who started HRT early, and 1.7% in women who didn't, (i.e. women who didn't take HRT seem to have had — on average — a 70% higher [[relative risk]] of dementia than women who began HRT around the time of the beginning of menopause). This suggests that there may be a "critical period" during which time taking HRT may have benefits, but if HRT is initiated after that period, it will not have such benefits and may cause harm. This is consistent with research that HRT improves executive and attention processes in postmenopausal women.&lt;ref name="pmid8909345"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt R, Fazekas F, Reinhart B, Kapeller P, Fazekas G, Offenbacher H, Eber B, Schumacher M, Freidl W | title = Estrogen replacement therapy in older women: a neuropsychological and brain MRI study | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 44 | issue = 11 | pages = 1307–13 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8909345}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also supported by research upon monkeys that were given ovariectomies to imitate the effect of menopause and then estrogen therapies.

For women who previously have had breast cancer, it is recommended to first consider other options for menopausal effects, such as [[bisphosphonate]]s or [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s (SERMs) for osteoporosis, [[cholesterol-lowering agent]]s and [[aspirin]] for cardiovascular disease, and [[vaginal estrogen]] for local symptoms. Observational studies of systemic HRT after breast cancer are generally reassuring. If HRT is necessary after breast cancer, estrogen-only therapy or estrogen therapy with a progestogen may be safer options than combined systemic therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ranzcog.edu.au/doc/management-of-the-menopause-after-breast-cancer.html Management of the menopause after breast cancer] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20160407214503/https://www.ranzcog.edu.au/doc/management-of-the-menopause-after-breast-cancer.html |date=2016-04-07 }}, from The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

===Hip fractures===
Estrogen prevents the activity of [[osteoclasts]], and improves [[bone mineral density]]. Hip fracture is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older females, and usually does not occur in the setting of [[osteoporosis]]. Estrogen is the only medical therapy that has been shown to prevent hip fractures in women that are not osteoporotic, with efficacy superior to [[bisphosphonates]] or [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] supplementation.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Ovarian cancer===
A 2015 meta-analysis found that HRT was associated with an increased risk of [[ovarian cancer]]. The authors concluded that if this association is causal, women using HRT have about one additional case of ovarian cancer per 1,000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collaborative Group on Epidemiological Studies of Ovarian Cancer|title=Menopausal hormone use and ovarian cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of 52 epidemiological studies|journal=The Lancet|volume=385|issue=9980|pages=1835|date=12 February 2015|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61687-1|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61687-1/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The extraction of CEEs from the urine of pregnant [[mares]] led to the marketing in 1942 of Premarin, one of the earlier forms of estrogen to be introduced.&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HumansOrganization2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans|author2=World Health Organization|author3=International Agency for Research on Cancer|title=Combined Estrogen-progestogen Contraceptives and Combined Estrogen-progestogen Menopausal Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGDU5xibtNgC&amp;pg=PA205|year=2007|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-832-1291-1|pages=205–}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time until the mid-1970s, estrogen was administered without a supplemental progestogen. Studies in the 1975 and thereafter demonstrated that in the absence of a progestogen, unopposed estrogen therapy with Premarin resulted in an 8-fold increased risk of [[endometrial cancer]].&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt; After this, sales of Premarin plummeted for a few years.&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt; However, it was shown by the early 1980s that the addition of a progestogen to estrogen therapy could mitigate the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in women with intact uteruses.&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt; This led to the development of combined estrogen–progestogen therapy who had not undergone [[hysterectomy]], most typically with a combination of Premarin and Provera (CEEs and MPA, respectively), and in the birth of the modern concept of what is referred to as "hormone replacement therapy".&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt;

The WHI trials were conducted between 1991 and 2004.&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt; However, the arm of the WHI receiving combined estrogen and progestin therapy was closed prematurely in 2002 by its [[Data Monitoring Committee]] (DMC) due to perceived health risks, although the trial arm was stopped only a full year after the data suggesting increased risk became manifest. In 2004, the arm of the WHI in which post-hysterectomy patients were being treated with estrogen alone was also closed by the DMC.

===Women's Health Initiative===
Clinical medical practice changed based upon two parallel [[Women's Health Initiative]] (WHI) studies of HRT. Prior studies were smaller, and many were of women who electively took hormonal therapy. The WHI studies were the first large, [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind]], placebo-controlled clinical trials of HRT in healthy women.

One portion of the parallel studies followed over 16,000 women for an average of 5.2 years, half of whom took [[placebo]], while the other half took a combination of CEEs and MPA (Prempro).

This WHI estrogen-plus-progestin trial was stopped prematurely in 2002 because preliminary results suggested risks of combined CEEs and progestins exceeded their benefits. The first report on the halted WHI estrogen-plus-progestin study came out in July 2002.&lt;ref name="JAMA"/&gt;

The study reported [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] increases in rates of [[breast cancer]], [[coronary heart disease]], [[stroke]]s and [[pulmonary embolism|pulmonary emboli]]. The study also found statistically significant decreases in rates of [[hip fracture]] and [[colorectal cancer]]. "A year after the study was stopped in 2002, an article was published indicating that estrogen plus progestin also increases the risks of dementia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|vauthors = Mazzucco AE, Santoro E, DeSoto M, Lee JH|url = http://www.center4research.org/hormone-therapy-menopause/|title = Hormone Therapy and Menopause|date = December 2010|website = National Research Center for Women and Families}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the study was that the HRT combination presented risks that outweighed its measured benefits. The results were almost universally reported as risks and problems associated with HRT in general, rather than with Prempro, the specific proprietary combination of CEEs and MPA studied.

After the increased clotting found in the first WHI results was reported in 2002, the number of Prempro prescriptions filled reduced by almost half. Following the WHI results, a large percentage of HRT users opted out of them, which was quickly followed by a sharp drop in breast cancer rates. The decrease in breast cancer rates has continued in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sharp Drop in Rates of Breast Cancer Holds| publisher=New York Times| author=Gina Kolata| date=2007-04-19| url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E6D91E3FF93AA25757C0A9619C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown number of women started taking alternatives to Prempro, such as compounded bioidentical hormones, though researchers have asserted that compounded hormones are not significantly different from conventional hormone therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=For a Low-Dose Hormone, Take Your Pick | publisher=New York Times| author=Roni Caryn Rabin| date = 2007-08-28| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E6D91539F93BA1575BC0A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 | quote = Many women seeking natural remedies have turned to compounding pharmacies, which use bioidentical hormones that are chemically synthesized but with the same molecular structure as hormones produced by a woman's body.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other portion of the parallel studies featured women who were post [[hysterectomy]] so who consequently did not need to take a progestogen when using estrogen. They were given either placebo or CEEs alone. This group did not show the risks demonstrated in the combination hormone study, and the estrogen-only study was not halted in 2002. However, in February 2004 it, too, was halted. While there was a 23% decreased incidence of breast cancer in the estrogen-only study participants, risks of stroke and pulmonary embolism were increased slightly, predominantly in patients who began HRT over the age of 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New WHI Estrogen Analysis Shows Lower Breast Ca Risk| publisher=MedPageToday | author=John Gever| date=2011-04-05| url= http://www.medpagetoday.com/OBGYN/HRT/25734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHI trial was limited by low adherence, high attrition, inadequate power to detect risks for some outcomes, and evaluation of few regimens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The double blinding limited validity of study results due to its effects on patient exclusion criteria. Patients who were experiencing symptoms of the menopausal transition were excluded from the study, meaning that younger women who had only recently experienced menopause were not significantly represented. As a result, while the average age of menopause is age 51, study participants were on average 62 years of age. Demographically, the vast majority were Caucasian, and tended to be slightly overweight and former smokers.

===Wyeth controversy===
{{See also|Medical ghostwriter}}

[[Wyeth]], now a [[subsidiary]] of [[Pfizer]], was a [[pharmaceutical company]] that marketed the HRT products Premarin (CEEs) and Prempro (CEEs + MPA).&lt;ref name="Singer2009"&gt;{{cite news | last = Singer | first = Natasha | date = 4 August 2009 | title = Medical Papers by Ghostwriters Pushed Therapy | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/health/research/05ghost.html | work = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | accessdate = 13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20838656"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fugh-Berman AJ | title = The haunting of medical journals: how ghostwriting sold "HRT" | journal = PLoS Med. | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = e1000335 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20838656 | pmc = 2935455 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000335 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[litigation]] involving Wyeth resulted in the release of 1,500&amp;nbsp;documents that revealed practices concerning its promotion of these medications.&lt;ref name="Singer2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20838656" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MayMay2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steve Kent May|author2=Steve May|title=Case Studies in Organizational Communication: Ethical Perspectives and Practices: Ethical Perspectives and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g7hduew1u1IC&amp;pg=PA197|date=20 January 2012|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-8309-9|pages=197–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents showed that Wyeth commissioned dozens of [[ghostwriting|ghostwritten]] [[literature review|reviews]] and commentaries that were published in [[medical journal]]s in order to promote unproven benefits of its HRT products, downplay their harms and risks, and cast competing therapies in a negative light.&lt;ref name="Singer2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20838656" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MayMay2012" /&gt; Starting in the mid-1990s and continuing for over a decade, Wyeth pursued an aggressive "publication plan" strategy to promote its HRT products through the use of ghostwritten publications.&lt;ref name="MayMay2012" /&gt; It worked mainly with DesignWrite, a medical writing firm.&lt;ref name="MayMay2012" /&gt; Between 1998 and 2005, Wyeth had 26&amp;nbsp;papers promoting its HRT products published in scientific journals.&lt;ref name="Singer2009" /&gt;

These favorable publications emphasized the benefits and downplayed the risks of its HRT products, especially the "misconception" of the association of its products with breast cancer.&lt;ref name="MayMay2012" /&gt; The publications defended unsupported cardiovascular "benefits" of its products, downplayed risks such as breast cancer, and promoted [[off-label]] and unproven uses like prevention of dementia, [[Parkinson's disease]], [[vision problems]], and [[wrinkle]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid20838656" /&gt; In addition, Wyeth emphasized negative messages against the SERM [[raloxifene]] for osteoporosis, instructed writers to stress the fact that "alternative therapies have increased in usage since the WHI even though there is little evidence that they are effective or safe...", called into question the quality and therapeutic equivalence of approved generic CEE products, and made efforts to spread the notion that the unique risks of CEEs and MPA were a class effect of all forms of menopausal HRT: "Overall, these data indicate that the benefit/risk analysis that was reported in the Women's Health Initiative can be generalized to all postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy products."&lt;ref name="pmid20838656" /&gt;

In any case, following the publication of the WHI data in 2002, the stock prices for the pharmaceutical industry plummeted, and huge numbers of women stopped using HRT.&lt;ref name="pmid28801526"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller VM, Harman SM | title = An update on hormone therapy in postmenopausal women: mini-review for the basic scientist | journal = Am.

According to Fugh-Berman (2010), "Today, despite definitive scientific data to the contrary, many gynecologists still believe that the benefits of [HRT] outweigh the risks in asymptomatic women. This non-evidence–based perception may be the result of decades of carefully orchestrated corporate influence on medical literature."&lt;ref name="pmid20838656" /&gt; Indeed, as many as 50% of physicians have expressed skepticism to the results of large trials like the WHI and HERS.&lt;ref name="pmid21949743"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tao M, Teng Y, Shao H, Wu P, Mills EJ | title = Knowledge, perceptions and information about hormone therapy (HT) among menopausal women: a systematic review and meta-synthesis | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = e24661 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21949743 | pmc = 3174976 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0024661 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive perceptions of many physicians of HRT in spite of large trials showing risks that potentially outweigh any benefits may be due to the efforts of pharmaceutical companies like Wyeth.&lt;ref name="MayMay2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fugh-Berman2015" /&gt;

'''Hypothetical types of biochemistry''' are forms of [[biochemistry]] speculated to be scientifically viable but not proven to exist at this time.&lt;ref name="McKay 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chance and Necessity in Biochemistry: Implications for the Search for Extraterrestrial Biomarkers in Earth-like Environments |journal=Astrobiology |date=May 27, 2014 |last=Davila |first=Alfonso F. |last2=McKay |first2=Christopher P. |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=534–540 |doi=10.1089/ast.2014.1150 |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2014.1150 |accessdate=2015-03-29 |bibcode=2014AsBio..14..534D |pmid=24867145 |pmc=4060776}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kinds of [[life|living organisms currently known on Earth]] all use [[carbon]] compounds for basic structural and [[metabolism|metabolic]] functions, [[water]] as a [[solvent]], and [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] to define and control their form.

The possibility of life-forms being based on "alternative" biochemistries is the topic of an ongoing scientific discussion, informed by what is known about extraterrestrial environments and about the chemical behaviour of various elements and compounds. It is also a [[science fiction theme|common subject in science fiction]].

The element [[silicon]] has been much discussed as a hypothetical alternative to carbon. Silicon is in the same group as carbon on the [[periodic table]] and, like carbon, it is [[tetravalent]], although the silicon analogs of [[organic compound]]s are generally less stable. Hypothetical alternatives to water include [[ammonia]], which, like water, is a [[chemical polarity|polar]] molecule, and cosmically abundant; and non-polar [[hydrocarbon]] solvents such as [[methane]] and [[ethane]], which are known to exist in liquid form on the surface of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

==Shadow biosphere==
[[Image:Arecibo message.svg|upright|thumb|The [[Arecibo message]] (1974) sent information into space about basic chemistry of Earth life.]]
{{main|Shadow biosphere}}
A shadow biosphere is a hypothetical [[microbe|microbial]] [[biosphere]] of Earth that uses radically different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] processes than currently known life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = P.

==Alternative-chirality biomolecules==

Perhaps the least unusual alternative biochemistry would be one with differing [[Left-handed protein|chirality]] of its biomolecules. In known Earth-based life, [[amino acid]]s are almost universally of the {{small|L}} form and [[sugar]]s are of the {{small|D}} form. Molecules of opposite chirality have identical chemical properties to their mirrored forms, so life that used {{small|D}} amino acids or {{small|L}} sugars may be possible; molecules of such a chirality, however, would be incompatible with organisms using the opposing chirality molecules. Amino acids whose chirality is opposite to the norm are found on Earth, and these substances are generally thought to result from decay of organisms of normal chirality.  However, physicist [[Paul Davies]] speculates that some of them might be products of "anti-chiral" life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P.C.W. Davies |author2=Charles H. Lineweaver |title=Hypothesis Paper: Finding a Second Sample of Life on Earth|date=2005|journal=Astrobiology|volume= 5|issue= 2|page=159|url= http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~charley/papers/DaviesLineweaverOnline05.pdf |doi= 10.1089/ast.2005.5.154 | bibcode= 2005AsBio...5..154D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is questionable, however, whether such a biochemistry would be truly alien. Although it would certainly be an alternative [[stereochemistry]], molecules that are overwhelmingly found in one [[enantiomer]] throughout the vast majority of organisms can nonetheless often be found in another enantiomer in different (often [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]) organisms such as in comparisons between members of [[Archaea]] and other [[Domain (biology)|domains]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} making it an open topic whether an alternative stereochemistry is truly novel.

==Non-carbon-based biochemistries==
On Earth, all known living things have a carbon-based structure and system. Scientists have speculated about the pros and cons of using [[atom]]s other than carbon to form the molecular structures necessary for life, but no one has proposed a theory employing such atoms to form all the necessary structures. However, as [[Carl Sagan]] argued, it is very difficult to be certain whether a statement that applies to all life on Earth will turn out to apply to all life throughout the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|first2=Jerome|last2=Agel|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| date=2000|isbn= 9780521783033|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan used the term "[[carbon chauvinism]]" for such an assumption.&lt;ref name="Sagan 2000page=46 46"&gt;{{cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| date=2000 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] as conceivable alternatives to carbon;&lt;ref name="Sagan 2000page=46 46"/&gt; but, on the other hand, he noted that carbon does seem more chemically versatile and is more abundant in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| date=2000|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon biochemistry===

[[File:Diatom2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Marine [[diatoms]]—carbon-based organisms that extract silicon from sea water, in the form of its oxide (silica) and incorporate it into their cell walls]]
{{see also|Organosilicon}}
The silicon atom has been much discussed as the basis for an alternative biochemical system, because silicon has many [[chemical property|chemical properties]] similar to those of carbon and is in the same [[group (periodic table)|group of the periodic table]], the [[carbon group]]. Like carbon, silicon can create molecules that are sufficiently large to carry biological information.&lt;ref name="Pace"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Pace|first1 = NR|title = The universal nature of biochemistry|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/805.full.pdf| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume = 98|issue = 3|pages = 805–8|date = 2001 |pmid = 11158550|pmc = 33372|doi = 10.1073/pnas.98.3.805|bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, silicon has several drawbacks as an alternative to carbon. Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt; Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as "monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules".&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt; This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of bio-organic chemistry).

[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable. It has been suggested that silicone-based chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulfuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations.&lt;ref name="world-building"&gt;{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Gillette| title=World-Building|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=0-89879-707-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the varieties of molecules identified in the [[interstellar medium]] {{As of|1998|lc=on}}, 84 are based on carbon while only eight are based on silicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html| title= F.10 Why do we assume that other beings must be based on carbon? Why couldn't organisms be based on other substances?| work=[sci.astro] ET Life (Astronomy Frequently Asked Questions)| accessdate=2006-07-21| first=Joseph| last=Lazio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, of those eight compounds, four also include carbon within them. The [[Abundance of the chemical elements|cosmic abundance]] of carbon to silicon is roughly 10 to 1. This may suggest a greater variety of complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos, providing less of a foundation on which to build silicon-based biologies, at least under the conditions prevalent on the surface of planets. Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets. Reasons for which may be that silicon is less versatile than carbon in forming compounds, that the compounds formed by silicon are unstable, and that it blocks the flow of heat.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, [[biogenic silica]] is used by some Earth life, such as the [[silicate]] skeletal structure of [[diatom]]s. According to the [[Abiogenesis#Clay hypothesis|clay hypothesis]] of [[Graham Cairns-Smith|A. G. Cairns-Smith]], silicate minerals in water played a crucial role in [[abiogenesis]]: they replicated their crystal structures, interacted with carbon compounds, and were the precursors of carbon-based life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Cairns-Smith| first=A.

Although not observed in nature, carbon–silicon bonds have been added to biochemistry by using directed evolution (artificial selection).  A heme containing cytochrome ''c'' protein from ''Rhodothermus marinus'' has been engineered using directed evolution to catalyze the formation of new carbon–silicon bonds between hydrosilanes and diazo compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kan|first=S.

Silicon compounds may possibly be biologically useful under temperatures or pressures different from the surface of a terrestrial planet, either in conjunction with or in a role less directly analogous to carbon. Polysilanols, the silicon compounds corresponding to [[sugar]]s, are soluble in liquid nitrogen, suggesting that they could play a role in very low temperature biochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astrobiology—the nature of life|publisher=WilliamBains.co.uk|author=William Bains |accessdate=2015-03-20|url=http://www.williambains.co.uk/astrobiology/life2.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=William Bains|title=Many Chemistries Could Be Used to Build Living Systems|date=June 2004|journal=[[Astrobiology (journal)|Astrobiology]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=137–167 |doi=10.1089/153110704323175124 |url= http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/153110704323175124 |pmid=15253836 |bibcode=2004AsBio...4..137B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinematic and literary science fiction, at a moment when man-made machines cross from nonliving to living, it is often posited{{by who|date=December 2018}}, this new form would be the first example of non-carbon-based life. Since the advent of the [[microprocessor]] in the late 1960s, these machines are often classed as [[computer]]s (or computer-guided [[robot]]s) and filed under "silicon-based life", even though the silicon backing matrix of these processors is not nearly as fundamental to their operation as carbon is for "wet life".

===Other exotic element-based biochemistries===
{{see also|Organoboron chemistry}}
* [[Boranes]] are dangerously explosive in Earth's atmosphere, but would be more stable in a reducing environment. However, boron's low cosmic abundance makes it less likely as a base for life than carbon.
* Various metals, together with oxygen, can form very complex and thermally stable structures rivaling those of organic compounds;{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} the [[heteropoly acid]]s are one such family. Some metal oxides are also similar to carbon in their ability to form both nanotube structures and diamond-like crystals (such as [[cubic zirconia]]). [[Titanium]], [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], and [[iron]] are all more abundant in the Earth's crust than carbon. Metal-oxide-based life could therefore be a possibility under certain conditions, including those (such as high temperatures) at which carbon-based life would be unlikely. The Cronin group at Glasgow University reported self-assembly of tungsten [[polyoxometalate]]s into cell-like spheres.&lt;ref name='Cronin'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20906-lifelike-cells-are-made-of-metal.html | title = Life-like cells are made of metal | accessdate = 2014-05-25 | date = September 14, 2011 | publisher = New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; By modifying their metal oxide content, the spheres can acquire holes that act as porous membrane, selectively allowing chemicals in and out of the sphere according to size.&lt;ref name='Cronin'/&gt;
* [[Sulfur]] is also able to form long-chain molecules, but suffers from the same high-reactivity problems as phosphorus and silanes. The biological use of sulfur as an alternative to carbon is purely hypothetical, especially because sulfur usually forms only linear chains rather than branched ones. (The biological use of sulfur as an electron acceptor is widespread and can be traced back 3.5&amp;nbsp;billion years on Earth, thus predating the use of molecular oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/5844/1534 Early Archaean Microorganisms Preferred Elemental Sulfur, Not Sulfate] Science AAAS, by Philippot, et al., (14 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sulfur-reducing bacteria]] can utilize elemental sulfur instead of oxygen, reducing sulfur to [[hydrogen sulfide]].)

==Arsenic as an alternative to phosphorus==
{{see also|GFAJ-1}}
[[Arsenic]], which is chemically similar to [[phosphorus]], while poisonous for most [[organism|life forms]] on Earth, is incorporated into the biochemistry of some organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umbbd.ethz.ch/periodic/elements/as.html |title=Biochemical Periodic Table – Arsenic |publisher=UMBBD |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[marine algae]] incorporate arsenic into complex organic molecules such as [[arsenosugar]]s and [[arsenobetaine]]s. [[Fungi]] and [[bacteria]] can produce volatile methylated arsenic compounds.

==Non-water solvents==
[[File:Carl Sagan Viking.JPG|175px|thumb|[[Carl Sagan]] speculated alien life might use ammonia, hydrocarbons or hydrogen fluoride instead of water.]]
In addition to carbon compounds, all currently known terrestrial life also requires water as a solvent. This has led to discussions about whether water is the only liquid capable of filling that role. The idea that an extraterrestrial life-form might be based on a solvent other than water has been taken seriously in recent scientific literature by the biochemist [[Steven Benner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benner |first=Steven A. |last2=Ricardo | first2=Alonso |last3=Carrigan |first3=Matthew A |title=Is there a common chemical model for life in the universe? |date=2004 |journal=[[Current Opinion in Chemical Biology]] |volume=8|pages=676–680 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.10.003 |issue=6 |pmid=15556414}}[http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf Text as pdf from www.sciencedirect.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214063212/http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf |date=2010-12-14 }} (accessed 13 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and by the astrobiological committee chaired by John A.

Carl Sagan once described himself as both a [[carbon chauvinist]] and a water chauvinist;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sagan, Carl|title=Cosmos|date=2002|isbn=0-375-50832-5|publisher=Random House|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; however on another occasion he said he was a carbon chauvinist but "not that much of a water chauvinist".&lt;ref name="conversations"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sagan, Carl |author2=Head, Tom |title=Conversations with Carl Sagan |date=2006 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=1-57806-736-7 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He speculated on hydrocarbons,&lt;ref name="conversations"/&gt;{{rp|11}} [[hydrofluoric acid]],&lt;ref name="Sagan, Carl 2002 128"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sagan, Carl |title=Cosmos|date=2002|isbn=0-375-50832-5|publisher=Random House|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ammonia&lt;ref name="conversations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagan, Carl 2002 128"/&gt;  as possible alternatives to water.

Some of the properties of water that are important for life processes include: 

* A complexity which leads to a large number of permutations of possible reaction paths including acid-base chemistry, H+ cations, OH- anions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals bonding, dipole-dipole and other polar interactions, aqueous solvent cages, and hydrolysis. This complexity offers a large number of pathways for evolution to produce life, many other solvents {{which?|date=November 2018}} have dramatically fewer possible reactions which severely limits evolution.
*Thermodynamic stability, the free energy of formation of liquid water is low enough (−237.24 kJ/mol) that water undergoes few reactions, other solvents are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen
*Water does not combust in oxygen because it is already the combustion product of hydrogen with oxygen. Most alternative solvents are not stable in an oxygen-rich atmosphere so it is highly unlikely those liquids could support aerobic life.
* A large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]]
*high solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide at room temperature supporting the evolution of aerobic aquatic plant and animal life
* A high [[heat capacity]] (leading to higher environmental temperature stability)
* Water is a room temperature liquid leading to a large population of quantum transition states required to overcome reaction barriers. Cryogenic liquids (such as liquid methane) have exponentially lower transition state populations which are needed for life based on chemical reactions. This leads to chemical reaction rates which may be so slow as to preclude the development of any life based on chemical reactions.{{cn|date=November 2018}}
* Spectroscopic transparency allowing solar radiation to penetrate several meters into the liquid (or solid), greatly aiding the evolution of aquatic life
* A large [[heat of vaporization]] leading to stable lakes and oceans
* The ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds
* The solid (ice) has lower density than the liquid, so ice floats on the liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.

Water as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapour or ice. Subsurface liquid water is considered likely or possible on several of the outer moons: [[Enceladus]] (where geysers have been observed), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Earth and Titan are the only worlds currently known to have stable bodies of liquid on their surfaces.

Not all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.&lt;ref name="barosswater"&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&amp;page=70 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, water ice has a high [[albedo]],&lt;ref name="barosswater"/&gt; meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.&lt;ref name="barosswater"/&gt;

There are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid phase temperature range at 1 atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|atm}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.

===Ammonia===
[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life might look.]]
The [[ammonia]] molecule (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.&lt;ref name="asimov"/&gt; The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when [[J.B.S. Haldane]] raised the topic at a symposium about life's origin.&lt;ref name="haldane"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=J.B.S. Haldane|date=1954|title=The Origins of Life|journal=New Biology|volume=16|pages=12–27}} cited in {{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/|title=ammonia-based life|last=Darling|first=David|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095038/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html|archivedate=2012-10-18|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous chemical reactions are possible in an ammonia solution, and liquid ammonia has chemical similarities with water.&lt;ref name="asimov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddammonia"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia can dissolve most organic molecules at least as well as water does and, in addition, it is capable of dissolving many elemental metals. Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is analogous to the water-related [[hydroxyl]] group (-OH).&lt;ref name="ddammonia"/&gt;

Ammonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. When ammonia accepts an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). When it donates an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="barossammonia"/&gt; Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].&lt;ref name="barossammonia"/&gt; Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a [[Acid-base reaction#Solvent system definition|solvent system definition]] of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium.&lt;ref name="ddammonia"/&gt; The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous [[imine]] group (C=NH) could be used instead.&lt;ref name="barossammonia"/&gt;

However, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect. Gerald Feinberg and [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] have questioned whether ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together well enough to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Life Beyond Earth| first=Gerald| last= Feinberg|author2=Robert Shapiro|publisher=Morrow| date=1980|isbn=9780688036423}} cited in {{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/ | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095038/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | archivedate = 2012-10-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia is also flammable in oxygen, and could not exist sustainably in an environment suitable for [[aerobic metabolism]].&lt;ref name="dsmammonia"&gt;{{cite book| title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints| first=Dirk | last= Schulze-Makuch|first2=Louis Neal|last2=Irwin|publisher=Springer| edition=2| date=2008|isbn= 9783540768166|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Layers of titan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Titan's theorized internal structure, subsurface ocean shown blue.]]
A [[biosphere]] based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual in relation to life on Earth. Life on Earth usually exists within the melting point and [[boiling point]] of water at [[normal pressure]], between 0&amp;nbsp;°C (273&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) and 100&amp;nbsp;°C (373&amp;nbsp;K); at normal pressure ammonia's melting and boiling points are between −78&amp;nbsp;°C (195&amp;nbsp;K) and −33&amp;nbsp;°C (240&amp;nbsp;K). Chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at a lower temperature. Therefore, ammonia-based life, if it exists, might metabolize more slowly and evolve more slowly than life on Earth.&lt;ref name="dsmammonia"/&gt; On the other hand, lower temperatures could also enable living systems to use chemical species that would be too unstable at Earth temperatures to be useful.&lt;ref name="asimov"/&gt;

Ammonia could be a liquid at Earth-like temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], ammonia melts at −77&amp;nbsp;°C (196&amp;nbsp;K) and boils at 98&amp;nbsp;°C (371&amp;nbsp;K).&lt;ref name="barossammonia"/&gt;

Ammonia and ammonia–water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based [[habitability zone]]. Such conditions could exist, for example, under the surface of [[Saturn]]'s largest moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/research/planetary/undergraduate/dom/titan/titan.htm|title=Exobiological Implications of a Possible Ammonia-Water Ocean Inside Titan|last=Fortes|first=A. D.|date=1999|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methane and other hydrocarbons===
Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a simple hydrocarbon: that is, a compound of two of the most common elements in the cosmos, hydrogen and carbon. It has a cosmic abundance comparable with ammonia.&lt;ref name="asimov"/&gt; Hydrocarbons could act as a solvent over a wide range of temperatures, but would lack [[chemical polarity|polarity]]. Isaac Asimov, the [[biochemist]] and science fiction writer, suggested in 1981 that poly-[[lipids]] could form a substitute for proteins in a non-polar solvent such as methane.&lt;ref name="asimov"/&gt; Lakes composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons, including methane and [[ethane]], have been detected on the surface of Titan by the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' spacecraft]].

Astrobiologist [[Christopher McKay (planetary scientist)|Chris McKay]] has argued, on thermodynamic grounds, that if life does exist on Titan's surface, using hydrocarbons as a solvent, it is likely also to use the more complex hydrocarbons as an energy source by reacting them with hydrogen, [[redox|reducing]] ethane and [[acetylene]] to methane.&lt;ref name="mckay"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Icarus|volume= 178| issue = 1|pages = 274–276|date= 2005|doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.018| title = Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane on the surface of Titan|author1=McKay, C.

D. |bibcode=2005Icar..178..274M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible evidence for this form of [[life on Titan]] was identified in 2010 by Darrell Strobel of [[Johns Hopkins University]]; a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of Titan compared to the lower layers, arguing for a downward diffusion at a rate of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near Titan's surface. As Strobel noted, his findings were in line with the effects Chris McKay had predicted if [[methanogenic]] life-forms were present.&lt;ref name="methlife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mckay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="strobel"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molecular hydrogen in Titan's atmosphere: Implications of the measured tropospheric and thermospheric mole fractions |author=Strobel, Darrell F. |journal=Icarus |volume=208 |issue=2 |pages=878–886 |date=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.03.003 |url=http://astrobiology.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Icarus-2010-Strobel.pdf |bibcode=2010Icar..208..878S |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824195338/http://astrobiology.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Icarus-2010-Strobel.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan's surface, which were interpreted by Chris McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms reducing acetylene to methane.&lt;ref name="methlife"/&gt; While restating the biological hypothesis, McKay cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are to be considered more likely: the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes (e.g. a non-living surface [[catalyst]] enabling acetylene to react with hydrogen), or flaws in the current models of material flow.&lt;ref name="life?"&gt;{{cite web|title= Have We Discovered Evidence For Life On Titan|author=Mckay, Chris|date=2010|url=http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/tharriso/ast105/making_sense.php.html |work=[[New Mexico State University]]&lt;!---[http://artsci.nmsu.edu/ College of Arts and Sciences], [http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/ Department of Astronomy]---&gt;| accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that even a non-biological catalyst effective at 95 K would in itself be a startling discovery.&lt;ref name="life?"/&gt;

====Azotosome====

A hypothetical [[cell membrane]] termed an ''azotosome'' capable of functioning in liquid [[methane]] in Titan conditions was computer-modeled in a paper published in February 2015. Composed of [[acrylonitrile]], a small molecule containing carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, it is predicted to have stability and flexibility in liquid methane comparable to that of a [[phospholipid bilayer]] (the type of cell membrane possessed by all life on Earth) in liquid water.&lt;ref name=azotosomepaper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=James|last2=Lunine|first2=Jonathan|last3=Clancy|first3=Paulette|title=Membrane alternatives in worlds without oxygen: Creation of an azotosome|journal=Science Advances|date=27 Feb 2015|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1400067|pmid=26601130|pmc=4644080|pages=e1400067|bibcode=2015SciA....1E0067S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=azotosomemodel&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2015-02-life-saturn-moon-titan.html Life 'not as we know it' possible on Saturn's moon Titan]&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of data obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA), completed in 2017, confirmed substantial amounts of acrylonitrile in Titan's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="SP-20170728"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Saturn Moon Titan Has Molecules That Could Help Make Cell Membranes |url=https://www.space.com/37653-saturn-moon-titan-cell-membrane-molecules.html |date=28 July 2017 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA-20170728"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Palmer, Maureen Y. et al. |title=ALMA detection and astrobiological potential of vinyl cyanide on Titan |url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/7/e1700022 |date=28 July 2017 |journal=[[Science Advances]] |volume =3 |number=7 |doi= 10.1126/sciadv.1700022 |accessdate=29 July 2017 |pmc=5533535 |bibcode=2017SciA....3E0022P |pmid=28782019 |page=e1700022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogen fluoride===
[[Hydrogen fluoride]] (HF), like water, is a polar molecule, and due to its polarity it can dissolve many ionic compounds. Its melting point is −84&amp;nbsp;°C and its boiling point is 19.54&amp;nbsp;°C (at [[atmospheric pressure]]); the difference between the two is a little more than 100 K. HF also makes hydrogen bonds with its neighbor molecules, as do water and ammonia. It has been considered as a possible solvent for life by scientists such as Peter Sneath&lt;ref name="sneath"&gt;{{cite book|title=Planets and Life|last=Sneath|first=P.H.A.|date=1970|publisher=Thames and Hudson}} cited in {{cite book|title=Extraterrestrial Encounter|last=Boyce|first=Chris|date=1981|publisher=New English Library|pages=125, 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carl Sagan.&lt;ref name="Sagan, Carl 2002 128"/&gt;

HF is dangerous to the systems of molecules that Earth-life is made of, but certain other organic compounds, such as [[paraffin wax]]es, are stable with it.&lt;ref name="Sagan, Carl 2002 128"/&gt; Like water and ammonia, liquid hydrogen fluoride supports an acid-base chemistry. Using a solvent system definition of acidity and basicity, [[nitric acid]] functions as a base when it is added to liquid HF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Chemistry in Nonaqueous Ionizing solvents: Inorganic Chemistry in Liquid Hydrogen Cyanide and Liquid hydrogen Fluoride| first=Gerhart| last= Jander| first2=Hans| last2= Spandau| first3=C.C.|last3=Addison|publisher=Pergamon Press| location=N.Y.| date=1971|volume=II}} cited in {{cite book| title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization| first=Robert A.| last= Freitas| publisher=Xenology Research Institute| location=Sacramento, CA| date=1979|chapter=8.2.2|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/8.2.2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, hydrogen fluoride is cosmically rare, unlike water, ammonia, and methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization| first=Robert A.| last= Freitas| publisher=Xenology Research Institute| location=Sacramento, CA| date=1979|chapter=8.2.2|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/8.2.2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogen sulfide===
[[Hydrogen sulfide]] is the closest [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|chemical analog to water,]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/solvent.html | title = solvent | accessdate = 2012-10-12 | last = Darling | first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is less polar and a weaker inorganic solvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Ionizing Solvents| first=J.| last= Jander| first2=C.| last2=Lafrenz | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., Verlag Chemie| location=Weinheim/Bergstr.| date=1970|volume=I}} cited in {{cite book| title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization| first=Robert A.| last= Freitas| publisher=Xenology Research Institute| location=Sacramento, CA| date=1979|chapter=8.2.2|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/8.2.2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen sulfide is quite plentiful on Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]], and may be in liquid form a short distance below the surface; astrobiologist [[Dirk Schulze-Makuch]] has suggested it as a possible solvent for life there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/3518/the-chance-for-life-on-io | title = The Chance for Life on Io | accessdate = 2013-05-25 | last = Choi | first = Charles Q.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a planet with hydrogen-sulfide oceans the source of the hydrogen sulfide could come from volcanos, in which case it could be mixed in with a bit of [[hydrogen fluoride]], which could help dissolve minerals. Hydrogen sulfide life might use a mixture of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as their carbon source. They might produce and live off of [[sulfur monoxide]], which is analogous to oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Hydrogen sulfide, like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, suffers from the small temperature range where it is liquid, though that, like that of hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, increases with increasing pressure.

===Silicon dioxide and silicates===
[[Silicon dioxide]], also known as glass, silica, or quartz, is very abundant in the universe and has a large temperature range where it is liquid. However, its melting point is {{convert|1,600|to|1,725|C|F}}, so it would be impossible to make organic compounds in that temperature, because all of them would decompose. Silicates are similar to silicon dioxide and some could have lower boiling points than silica. [[Gerald Feinberg]] and [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] have suggested that molten silicate rock could serve as a liquid medium for organisms with a chemistry based on silicon, oxygen, and other elements such as [[aluminium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David W. Koerner |author2=Simon LeVay |title=Here Be Dragons : The Scientific Quest for Extraterrestrial Life:|date=2000|isbn=9780198033370|publisher=Oxford U.P.|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other solvents or cosolvents===

* More complex compounds: [[sulfuric acid]],&lt;ref name="barosssulfuric"/&gt; [[formamide]],&lt;ref name="Planetary Systems p 74"/&gt; [[methanol]]&lt;ref name="wardsolvents"/&gt;
* Very-low-temperature fluids: [[liquid nitrogen]],&lt;ref name="barosscryo"/&gt; and [[liquid hydrogen|hydrogen]]&lt;ref name="barosscryo"/&gt;
* High-temperature liquids: [[sodium chloride]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/the-methane-habitable-zone/ The methane habitable zone]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfuric acid in liquid form is strongly polar. It remains liquid at higher temperatures than water, its liquid range being 10&amp;nbsp;°C to 337&amp;nbsp;°C at a pressure of 1 atm, although above 300&amp;nbsp;°C it will slowly decompose. Sulfuric acid is known to be abundant in the [[atmosphere of Venus|clouds of Venus]], in the form of [[aerosol]] droplets. In a biochemistry that used sulfuric acid as a solvent, the [[alkene]] group (C=C), with two carbon atoms joined by a double bond, could function analogously to the carbonyl group (C=O) in water-based biochemistry.&lt;ref name="barosssulfuric"/&gt;

A proposal has been made that life on Mars may exist and be using a mixture of water and [[hydrogen peroxide]] as its solvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Possible Biogenic Origin for Hydrogen Peroxide on Mars | journal = International Journal of Astrobiology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 147 | date = 2007-05-22 | first = Joop M. | last = Houtkooper |author2=Dirk Schulze-Makuch | doi = 10.1017/S1473550407003746 | arxiv = physics/0610093 |bibcode = 2007IJAsB...6..147H }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 61.2% (by weight) mix of water and hydrogen peroxide has a freezing point of −56.5&amp;nbsp;°C, and also tends to [[super-cool]] rather than crystallize. It is also [[hygroscopic]], an advantage in a water-scarce environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EPSC2007/00439/EPSC2007-J-00439.pdf|format=PDF| journal=EPSC Abstracts| volume= 2| id= EPSC2007-A-00439| date=2007| publisher=European Planetary Science Congress 2007| title=The H2O2-H2O Hypothesis: Extremophiles Adapted to Conditions on Mars?| first=Joop M.| last= Houtkooper|author2=Dirk Schulze-Makuch| bibcode=2007epsc.conf..558H|  pages=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001109/| title=Europlanet : Life's a bleach| date=2007-08-24| first=Doug| last= Ellison| publisher=Planetary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercritical carbon dioxide has been proposed as a candidate for alternative biochemistry due to its ability to selectively dissolve organic compounds and assist the functioning of enzymes and because "super-Earth"- or "super-Venus"-type planets with dense high-pressure atmospheres may be common.&lt;ref name="Supercritical Carbon Dioxide"/&gt;

==Other speculations==

===Non-green photosynthesizers===
Physicists have noted that, although photosynthesis on Earth generally involves green plants, a variety of other-colored plants could also support photosynthesis, essential for most life on Earth, and that other colors might be preferred in places that receive a different mix of stellar radiation than Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/spectrum_plants.html |title=NASA – NASA Predicts Non-Green Plants on Other Planets |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2008-02-23 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kiang"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Kiang | first = Nancy Y. |author2=Segura, Antígona |author3=Tinetti, Giovanna |author4=Jee, Govind |author5=Blankenship, Robert E. |author6=Cohen, Martin |author7=Siefert, Janet |author8=Crisp, David |author9= Meadows, Victoria S.  | title = Spectral signatures of photosynthesis.

These studies indicate that, although blue photosynthetic plants would be less likely, yellow or red plants are plausible.&lt;ref name = "Kiang"/&gt;

===Variable environments===

Many Earth plants and animals undergo major biochemical changes during their life cycles as a response to changing environmental conditions, for example, by having a [[spore]] or [[hibernation]] state that can be sustained for years or even millennia between more active life stages.&lt;ref name="Christmas in Yellowstone"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/yellowstone/hibernate.html |title=Christmas in Yellowstone |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, it would be biochemically possible to sustain life in environments that are only periodically consistent with life as we know it.

For example, frogs in cold climates can survive for extended periods of time with most of their body water in a frozen state,&lt;ref name="Christmas in Yellowstone"/&gt; whereas desert frogs in Australia can become inactive and dehydrate in dry periods, losing up to 75% of their fluids, yet return to life by rapidly rehydrating in wet periods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1933854 Main and Bentley, Ecology, "Water Relations of Australian Burrowing Frogs and Tree Frogs" (1964)]&lt;/ref&gt; Either type of frog would appear biochemically inactive (i.e. not living) during dormant periods to anyone lacking a sensitive means of detecting low levels of metabolism.

===Dust and plasma-based===

Tsytovich and colleagues proposed that lifelike behaviors could be exhibited by dust particles suspended in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], under conditions that might exist in space.&lt;ref name="dust1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070814150630.htm| date=2007-08-15| publisher=Science Daily| title=Physicists Discover Inorganic Dust With Lifelike Qualities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dust2"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1367-2630/9/8/263| title=From plasma crystals and helical structures towards inorganic living matter| journal= New J.

* The concept of reversed chirality also figured prominently in the plot of [[James Blish]]'s ''Star Trek'' novel ''[[Spock Must Die!]]'', where a transporter experiment gone awry ends up creating a duplicate Spock who turns out to be a perfect mirror-image of the original all the way down to the atomic level.
* The eponymous organism in [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' is described as reproducing via the direct conversion of energy into matter.
* Silicoids: [[John Drury Clark|John Clark]], in the introduction to the 1952 shared-world anthology ''[[The Petrified Planet]]'', outlined the biologies of the planet Uller, with a mixture of siloxane and silicone life, and of Niflheim, where metabolism is based on hydrofluoric acid and carbon tetrafluoride.
* In the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[The Devil in the Dark]]", a highly intelligent silicon-based creature called ''Horta'', made almost entirely of pure rock, with eggs which take the form of silicon nodules scattered throughout the caverns and tunnels of its home planet. Subsequently, in the non-canonical Star Trek book '[[The Romulan Way]]', another Horta is a junior officer in Starfleet.
* In ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', the [[Crystalline Entity]] appeared in two episodes, "[[Datalore]]" and "[[Silicon Avatar]]". This was an enormous spacefaring [[crystal structure|crystal lattice]] that had taken thousands of lives in its quest for energy. It was destroyed before communications could be established.
* In the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation]] episode "Home Soil" the Enterprise investigates the sabotage of a planetary terraforming station and the death of one of its members; these events are finally attributed to a completely non-organic, solar powered, saline thriving sentient life form. 
* In the [[Star Trek: Enterprise]] episode "[[Observer_Effect_(Star_Trek:_Enterprise)|Observer Effect]]" Ensign Sato and Commander Tucker are infected by a silicon-based virus, while being observed by a non-physical life forms called [[List_of_Star_Trek_races#Organian|Organians]] testing humanity if they are intelligent enough to engage in first contact. A reference to [[The Andromeda Strain (film)]] was also made in this episode.
* In the 1994 ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Firewalker (The X-Files)|Firewalker]]", Mulder and Scully investigate a death in a remote research base and discover that a new silicon-based fungus found in the area may be affecting and killing the researchers.
* The [[Orion's Arm Universe Project]], an online collaborative science-fiction project, includes a number of extraterrestrial species with exotic biochemistries, including organisms based on low-temperature [[carbohydrate]] chemistry, organisms that consume and live within [[sulfuric acid]], and organisms composed of structured [[magnetic flux tubes]] within [[Neutron star|neutron stars]] or [[gas giant]] cores.

'''Inspiration Mars Foundation''' is an American [[nonprofit organization]] founded by [[Dennis Tito]] that in 2013 proposed to launch a crewed mission to [[Planetary flyby|flyby]] [[Mars]] in January 2018,&lt;ref name=Borenstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boucher/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sonnenberg/&gt; or 2021 if they missed the first [[Synodic period|synodic opportunity]] in 2018.&lt;ref name=parabolicarc20131120&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2013/11/20/dennis-titos-prepared-remarks-congress-human-mars-mission/ |title=Dennis Tito's Prepared Remarks Before Congress on Human Mars Mission at Parabolic Arc |publisher=Parabolicarc.com |date=2013-11-20 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their website became defunct by late 2015 but it is archived by the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref name=webarchive20151013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inspirationmars.org/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013012955/http://inspirationmars.org/ |archivedate=13 October 2015|title=The Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation's future plans are unclear.

==History==
On 27 February 2013, the Inspiration Mars Foundation held a press conference in the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] to announce their plan to procure space hardware, launch vehicle services, and select a two-person married couple as crew,&lt;ref name=Moskowitzf/&gt; and then attempt to [[fundraising|raise the funding]] necessary to [[space launch|launch]] a mission to Mars in 2018. Dennis Tito said he was going to fund the foundation with $100 million for the first years of operation.&lt;ref name=Belfiore/&gt;

At the 2013 conference, however, Dennis Tito indicated that the plan was impossible without significant investment from NASA and the use of NASA spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24633-ambitious-mars-joyride-cannot-succeed-without-nasa.html?page=1 |title=Ambitious Mars joy-ride cannot succeed without NASA - space - 21 November 2013 |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA, however, was an unwilling partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/11/20/dennis_tito_it_will_take_less_than_1_billion_to_make_mars_mission_happen/|title=Dennis Tito: It will take "less than $1 billion" to make Mars mission happen|first=Lindsay|last=Abrams|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
The total cost of the mission was projected to be between US$1 and US$2 billion.&lt;ref name=usn20130301&gt;
{{cite news |last=Koebler|first=Jason |title=Expert: Dennis Tito's Mars Flyby Has '1-in-3' Chance of Succeeding |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/03/01/expert-dennis-titos-mars-flyby-has-1-in-3-chance-of-succeeding |accessdate=2013-03-07 |newspaper=US News |date=2013-03-01 |quote=''At a news conference in Washington, D.C., Tito said he's tired of waiting for NASA to send humans to Mars, and that he'd help finance the between $1 and $2 billion needed to complete the mission.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tito planned to fund the foundation's cost for the first two years.&lt;ref name=awst20130304/&gt;  Then, the foundation planned to raise funds from industry and individuals.&lt;ref name=awst20130304/&gt;

However, in testimony before congress in November 2013, Tito indicated that he expected private donors to only provide around $300 million, leaving the need for an additional investment of $700 million from the US government. NASA responded that whilst they were willing to share technical and programmatic expertise with Inspiration Mars, they were unable to commit to sharing expenses with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/11/20/dennis_tito_it_will_take_less_than_1_billion_to_make_mars_mission_happen/ |title=Dennis Tito: It will take "less than $1 billion" to make Mars mission happen |publisher=Salon.com |date=2013-11-20 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation's funding model, dependent on an unwilling partner, was broken.

In March 2014, [[SpaceX]] indicated that they had also been contacted by Inspiration Mars, but that accommodating such requirements would require some additional work and that such work was not a part of the current focus of SpaceX.&lt;ref name=tss20140321&gt;
{{cite AV media|people=Gwynne Shotwell |date=2014-03-21 |title=Broadcast 2212: Special Edition, interview with Gwynne Shotwell |medium=audio file |url=http://archived.thespaceshow.com/shows/2212-BWB-2014-03-21.mp3 |accessdate=2014-03-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013556/http://archived.thespaceshow.com/shows/2212-BWB-2014-03-21.mp3 |archivedate=22 March 2014 |format=mp3 |time=11:20–12:10 |publisher=The Space Show |id=2212 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposal==
[[File:Inspiration Mars trajectory.svg|thumb|299px|Approximate Inspiration Mars Trajectory (not to scale)]]
[[File:Artist's Concept of Inspiration Mars Capsule.jpg|thumb|299px|Artist's Concept of Inspiration Mars Capsule and Hab.]]
[[File:Inspiration Mars Periapsis.jpg|thumb|299px|Inspiration Mars Periapsis.]]

The proposal, that was never funded,&lt;ref name=Belfiore/&gt; was based on a [[free return trajectory]] to allow the [[spacecraft]] to use the smallest possible amount of [[rocket propellant|propellant]] to flyby Mars and return to Earth. Leaders of the Foundation stated that the January 2018 launch window offered a rare orbit opportunity to travel to Mars and return to Earth in 501 days.&lt;ref name=awst20130304&gt;{{cite news |last=Morring|first=Frank, Jr. |title=Serious Intent About 2018 Human Mars Mission |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/AW_03_04_2013_p24-553876.xml |accessdate=2013-03-07 |newspaper=Aviation Week and Space Technology |date=2013-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Their backup plan involved a mission that would begin in 2021 but be 88 days longer in duration. They stated it would require both a flyby of Venus and a fly-by of Mars. The flight would take the spacecraft to within 800 kilometres of the surface of Venus, using the planet for a [[gravity assist]] to speed the onward travel to Mars.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24633-ambitious-mars-joyride-cannot-succeed-without-nasa.html |title=Ambitious Mars joy-ride cannot succeed without NASA - space - 21 November 2013 |publisher=New Scientist |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a paper written by Dennis Tito,{{CN|date=October 2018}} "the mission would require no maneuvers except small course corrections after a [[Trans-Mars injection|trans-Martian injection]] burn, [and] would allow no aborts. ... [It will] use [[low Earth orbit]] [[launch vehicle|launch]] and [[List of crewed spacecraft|crewed-spacecraft technology]], outfitted for the long duration of a flight to Mars."

They speculated that when the spacecraft returned to Earth it would reenter the atmosphere at 50&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km per hour (ca 13.9&amp;nbsp;km/s), which was faster than any previous return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nigel Henbest|authorlink1=Nigel Henbest|title=Race to Mars: Who will be first to the Red Planet?|journal=New Scientist|date=13 July 2013|pages=42–45|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929252.100-race-to-mars-who-will-be-first-to-the-red-planet.html?full=true#.VS-3QKO8-D8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student design competition===
During the 16th Annual International Mars Society Convention in 2013, the Mars Society announced the launch of an international engineering competition for student teams to propose design concepts for the architecture of the Inspiration Mars mission. The contest was open to university engineering student teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marssociety.org/home/inspiration-mars/rules |title=Rules |publisher=The Mars Society |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design contest took place on August 9, 2014, and was won by an international team from [[Purdue University]] in US and [[Keio University]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archives.marssociety.org/home/press/announcements/teamkanauwinsinspirationmarsstudentdesigncontest |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=April 2017}}

==Critiques==
A spokesman for NASA stated that "Inspiration Mars's proposed schedule is a significant challenge due to life support systems, space radiation response, habitats and the human psychology of being in a small spacecraft for over 500 days", but that "we remain open to further collaboration as their proposal and plans for a later mission develop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joel|last=Achenbach |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/going-to-mars-billionaire-dennis-tito-plans-manned-mission-with-possible-2017-launch/2013/11/20/b859bc76-51e8-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html |title=Going to Mars: Billionaire Dennis Tito plans manned mission with possible 2017 launch |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, also found the short preparation time-frame wanting, saying that it is "totally implausible" for a mission to be launched in 2018, although the"Plan B" mission might be possible "if the stars align".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/going-to-mars-billionaire-dennis-tito-plans-manned-mission-with-possible-2017-launch/2013/11/20/b859bc76-51e8-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story_1.html |title=Going to Mars: Billionaire Dennis Tito plans manned mission with possible 2017 launch |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2013-06-20 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear whether the Foundation is still in operation as their website is now defunct.&lt;ref name=webarchive20151013/&gt;

First references to the idea of an ''Institute for the Future'' may be found in a 1966 Prospectus by [[Olaf Helmer]] and others.&lt;ref name="ref_IFTFProspectus"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Olaf Helmer|title=Prospectus for an Institute for the Future |url=https://saltworks.stanford.edu/catalog/druid:hn553xs4979 |date=26 May 1966 |publisher=Organising Committee for an Institute for the Future |access-date=19 Feb 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at [[RAND Corporation]], Helmer had already been involved with developing the [[Delphi method]] of [[futures studies]]. He, and others, wished to extend the work further with an emphasis on examining multiple scenarios. This can be seen in the prospectus summary:
*''To explore systematically the possible futures for our [USA] nation and for the international community.''
*''To ascertain which among these possible futures seems desirable, and why.''
*''To seek means by which the probability of their occurrence can be enhanced through appropriate purposeful action.''&lt;ref name="ref_Cornish" /&gt;

=== First years ===
The Institute opened in 1968, in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. The initial group was led by [[Frank Davidson]] and included [[Olaf Helmer]], [[Paul Baran]], [[Arnold Kramish]], and Theodore Gordon.&lt;ref name="ref_Cornish" /&gt;
&lt;!-- NB: 1. [[Theodore Gordon]] article is about a different person 2. George Mandanis was mentioned in earlier version of article, but is not referred to in cites. Add back if that changes. --&gt;

The Institute’s work initially relied on the forecasting methods built upon by Helmer while at RAND. The [[Delphi method]] was used to glean information from multiple anonymous sources. It was augmented by [[Cross Impact Analysis]], which encouraged analysts to consider multiple future scenarios.&lt;ref name="ref_millett"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Should Probabilities Be Used with Scenarios? |author=Stephen M. Millett |url=http://archive.cspo.org/projects/plausibility/files/read_Millett-Should-Probabilities-Be-Used-with-Scenerios.pdf |date=May 2009 |publisher=Journal of Future Studies |isbn= |pages=61–68 |quote=''[Helmer] and his close associate, Selwyn Enzer, developed a computer-based cross-impact model to generate multiple scenarios as alternative futures.'' |access-date=24 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303085919/http://archive.cspo.org/projects/plausibility/files/read_Millett-Should-Probabilities-Be-Used-with-Scenerios.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While precise and powerful, the methods that had been developed in a corporate environment were oriented to providing business and economic analyses. At a 1971 conference on [[mathematical modelling]] Helmer noted the need for similar improvements in societal modelling.&lt;ref name="ref_helmersoc"&gt;{{cite journal  |title= ''The Role of Futures Research in Societal Modelling'' |author=Olaf Helmer |journal=International Seminar on Trends in Mathematical Modelling: Venice, 13–18 December 1971 |editor=Nigel Hawkes  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVHuCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFyYy-rYrLAhUGJpQKHcbKBjUQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false |date=May 2009 |publisher=Springer Science and Business Media |isbn= |pages=9–13 |access-date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts at doing so included a ‘Future State of the Union’ report, formatted according to the traditional US Presidential address to the Nation.&lt;ref name="ref_FSOU"&gt;{{citation |title=''On the Future State of the Union'' |author=Olaf Helmer |journal=Report R-27 |url= |date=1972 |publisher=Institute for the Future |isbn=  |quote=  |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite establishing an excellent reputation for painstaking analysis of future analyses and forecasting methods, various problems meant that the Institute struggled to find its footing at first. In 1970 Helmer took over the leadership from Davidson, and the Institute shifted its Headquarters to [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;ref name="ref_Rescher"&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in 20th Century Philosophy |author=Nicholas Rescher |page=203 |publisher=Ontos Verlag |date=28 Feb 2005 |isbn=3937202781 |access-date=19 Feb 2016 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbK3DklrwEkC&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[Roy Amara]] took over from Helmer, who continued to run the Middletown office until his departure in 1973.&lt;ref name="ref_Cornish" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_Rescher"/&gt; Amara held this position until 1990. During Amara's presidency, the Institute conducted some of the earliest studies of the impact of the [[ARPANET]] on collaborative work and scientific research, and was notable for its research on computer mediated communications, also known as [[groupware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electronic enterprises : looking to the future.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2rIkxJ_eHMC&amp;pg=PA44|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-2051-4|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from the early seventies [[astrophysicist]] and [[computer scientist]] [[Jacques Vallee]], [[sociologist]] Bob Johansen, and technology forecaster [[Paul Saffo]] worked for IFTF.&lt;ref name="Vallee2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Vallee|title=The Heart of the Internet: An Insider's View of the Origin and Promise of the On-Line Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EH46qowjvasC|year=2003|publisher=Jacques Vallee|isbn=978-1-57174-369-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== An increase in corporate focus ===
In 1975 the Corporate Associates Program was started to assist private organisations interpret emerging trends and the long-term consequences.&lt;ref name="ref_cornish2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMbylT5nsD0C&amp;pg=PA241&amp;f=false |title=The Study of the Future: An Introduction to the Art and Science of Understanding and Shaping Tomorrow's World |author=Edward Cornish |page=241 |publisher=Transaction publishers |date=1 January 1977 |quote= |access-date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this program operated until 2001, its role as the Institute's main reporting tool was superseded by the Ten Year Forecast in 1978.&lt;ref name="ref_tyf1978"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucat.iu.edu/iub/6623677 |title=''Catalog entry for Ten year forecast'' |publisher=IUCat |quote=''Publishing history: began in 1978'' |access-date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 the [[sociologist]] Herbert L Smith noted that, by the late 1970s, the idea of an open Union reporting format had given way to the proprietary Ten Year Forecast. Smith interpreted this as a renewed focus on business forecasting as public funds became scarce.&lt;ref name="ref_smith"&gt;{{cite journal |title=''The Social Forecasting Industry'' |journal=Forecasting in the Social and Natural Sciences |editors= Kenneth C. Land, Stephen H. Schneider |author=Herbert L Smith  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=izLrCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=1987 |publisher=D. Riedel Publishing Company  |isbn= |page=43 |quote=  |access-date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear how pertinent Smith's observations were to how the Institute was operating in this period. Sociologists such as Bob Johansen continued to be active in the Institute's projects. Having taken part in early ARPANET development, Institute staff were well aware of the impact that computer networking would have on society and its inclusion in policy making.&lt;ref name="ref_NYT"&gt;{{cite journal |title=''Study Says Technology Could Transform Society'' |author=Robert Rheinhold  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/14/us/study-says-technology-could-transform-society.html |date=14 June 1982 |publisher=New York Times |isbn= |quote= |access-date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 1984 essay, Roy Amara appeared to acknowledge some form of crisis, and a renewed interest in societal forecasting.&lt;ref name="ref_Amara"&gt;{{cite journal |title=''New directions for futures research —setting the stage'' |author=Roy Amara  |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016328784901034 |date=August 1984 |journal=Futures |publisher=Institute for the Future |isbn= |quote=''Futures research is currently in a state of abeyance and may well be approaching a critical crossroad...

=== Evolution of societal forecasting ===
New ways of presenting studies to a less specialised audience were adopted, or developed. As an aid to memory retention, 'Vignetting' presented future scenarios as short stories; to illustrate the point of the scenario, and engage the reader’s attention.&lt;ref name="ref_vignette"&gt;{{cite book |title=Facilitating Learning Organizations: Making Learning Count  |author1=Victoria J. Marsick |author2=Karen E. Watkins  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xu-f2AMbxgC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;&amp;f=false |year=1999 |publisher=Gower publishing |pp=90 |isbn= |quote= |access-date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later initiatives showed an increasing emphasis on narrative engagement, e.g. ‘Artifacts of the future’,&lt;ref name="ref_artifact"&gt;{{cite book |title=''A Generous Community: Being the Church in a New Missionary Age''  |author=C.

[[Ethnography|Ethnographic]] forecasting was adopted as it became recognised that "society" was actually a myriad of sub-cultures, each with its own outlook.
&lt;ref name="ref_AnticAnth"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Essays in Anticipatory Anthropology |journal=Futures  |author=Victoria M. Razak |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=puB3iqOeAggC |volume=32 |year= 2000 | doi = 10.1016/s0016-3287(00)00022-7 |publisher=Institute for the Future |editor=T Stevenson  |pages=717–723 |isbn= |quote= |access-date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="ref_ethnography"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Trusting Strangers: Work Relationships in Four High-Tech Communities |journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society  |authors=J.A.

While older forecasting methods sought the advice of field experts, newer techniques sought the statistical input from all members of society.  Public interaction, provided via the internet and social media, made it possible to engage in  "bottom up forecasting".&lt;ref name="ref_beingandwellbeing"&gt;{{cite book |title=Being and Well-Being: Health and the Working Bodies of Silicon Valley |author=J.A.

This game enlisted the blogs and wikis of over  5,000 people to discuss life 10 years in the future; presenting them with a set of hypothetical, overlapping social threats, and encouraging them to seek collaborative "superstruct" solutions.&lt;ref name="ref_mmorpg"&gt;{{cite journal |title=''MMOs to help futurists solve world problems?'' |author=Daniel Terdiman |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/mmos-to-help-futurists-solve-world-problems/ |date=9 January 2009 |publisher=CNet |isbn= |quote= |access-date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the superstruct was subsequently incorporated into the Institute's ‘Foresight Engine’ tool.&lt;ref name="ref_foresightengine"&gt;{{cite journal |title=''Foresight 2.0 - Definition, overview &amp; evaluation'' |authors=Jörg Schatzmann, René Schäfer, Frederik Eichelbaum |journal=European Journal of Futures Research |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40309-013-0015-4 |date=December 2013 |publisher= |isbn= |quote= |access-date=25 February 2016 |doi=10.1007/s40309-013-0015-4 |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
The Institute maintains research programs on the futures of technology, health, and organizations. It publishes a variety of reports and maps, as well as ''Future Now'', a blog on emerging technologies. It offers three programs to its clients:
* The Ten year forecast is the Institute's signature piece, having operated since 1978.&lt;ref name="ref_tyf1978"/&gt; It tracks today’s latent signals, and forecasts what they might mean for business in ten years' time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BsQudpHXn4C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;f=false |title=''Designing Culture: The Technological Imagination at Work'' |pages=52–53 |author=Anne Balsamo |publisher=Duke University Press |date=19 June 2011 |access-date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schwartz |first1=Ariel |title=Predictions About The Last Decade, From Futurists In 2005|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/3041052/futurist-forum/predictions-about-the-last-decade-from-futurists-in-2005|accessdate=17 September 2015|publisher=Fast Company|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While these programs are cited quite widely, it is for their content, not their purpose. This makes it difficult to describe them without recourse to Primary Sources. --&gt;

In 2014 the Institute moved its Headquarters to 201 Hamilton Avenue, [[Palo Alto, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2014/06/23/shoptalk-mings-still-open-downtown-retail-moves-out |title=''ShopTalk: Ming's still open, downtown Palo Alto retail moves out'' |author=Daryl Savage  |date=23 June 2014 |journal=Palo Alto Online |publisher=Embarcadero Media |quote=''The prestigious think tank Institute for the Future recently moved into 201 Hamilton Ave., at the corner of Emerson Street.'' |access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute's annual publication ''Future Now'' is intended to provide summaries of the Institute's body of research. The inaugural edition was published in February 2017. Its theme ''The New Body Language'' concentrated on the Technology Horizons Program's studies on human and machine symbiosis.

== People ==
{{As of|2016}} the Institute's executive director is Marina Gorbis. Also associated with the institute are [[David Pescovitz]], [[Anthony M. Townsend]], [[Jane McGonigal]], and [[Jamais Cascio]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17521">The '''Los Angeles fetus disposal scandal''' was the 1982 discovery of over 16,000 aborted fetuses being improperly stored at Malvin Weisberg's [[Woodland Hills, California|Woodland Hills]], California, home and the ensuing legal battle regarding their disposal. It was called a "national tragedy" by the then-president [[Ronald Reagan]] and inspired a song by pop singer [[Pat Boone]], with the fetuses finally buried in 1985. No criminal charges were filed against any of the parties involved.&lt;ref name="sac-bee"&gt;{{cite news|last=Raimundo|first=Jeff|title=High court stymies LA burial of fetuses|date=March 19, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg had stored the specimens properly but had not disposed of them due to financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="sac-bee"/&gt;

==Discovery==
Malvin Weisberg had operated Medical Analytic Laboratories in [[Santa Monica]] from 1976 until March 1981.&lt;ref name="secret"&gt;{{cite news|title=Secret Meeting Set in Fetus Discovery Case|last=Blake|first=Gene|date=11 February 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=SD_A13|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meeting on Fetuses|date=18 February 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=D4|}}&lt;/ref&gt; He purchased a 20-foot (6.1 m) [[Intermodal container|storage container]] in 1980, delivering it to his Woodland Hills home and paying for it with a [[Non-sufficient funds|bounced check]] for $1700.&lt;ref name="secret" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fivehundred" /&gt; The container was repossessed on February 3, 1982, by the [[Martin Container Company]], based in the [[Wilmington, Los Angeles|Wilmington]] area of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="fivehundred" /&gt; The company opened the container on the following day, discovering the fetuses, which were stored in [[formaldehyde]].&lt;ref name="fivehundred" /&gt;

The initial press conference, on February 5, 1982, by the [[Los Angeles County Department of Health Services|Los Angeles County Health Department]] said up to 500 fetuses were found.&lt;ref name="fivehundred"&gt;{{cite news|title=500 Fetuses Found in Storage|last=Michaelson|first=Judith|date=6 February 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=B6|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, 1982, the count of fetuses was raised to approximately 2000, with the majority of them being from the storage container and 200–300 from Weisberg's garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials Find 200 to 400 More Fetuses|date=24 February 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=A3|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legality of State Abortion Law Doubted: Discovery of 2,000 Fetuses Raises Issue of Validity of Prohibitions|last=Jacobs|first=Paul|date=26 February 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=B1|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TrlMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OPsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=medical-analytic-laboratories&amp;pg=6593%2C2870422|title=2,000 fetuses linked to out-of-business laboratory|date=25 February 1982|work=[[Lakeland Ledger]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|page=19|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tally of fetuses was estimated at "up to 17,000" in May 1982,&lt;ref name="each" /&gt; and was later finally set at 16,431.&lt;ref name="charges" /&gt; A count of 193 fetuses were evidently over 20 weeks' [[gestation]], with the oldest almost 30 weeks.&lt;ref name="charges" /&gt;

State law required the fetuses to be cremated or buried "within a reasonable time".&lt;ref name="depol" /&gt;

==Source and age of the fetuses==
The fetuses resulted from pregnancies terminated by licensed physicians, clinics and hospitals who contracted Medical Analytic Laboratories for pathology testing and disposal of the fetuses.&lt;ref name="charges" /&gt;&lt;ref name="court" /&gt;

The [[Los Angeles County District Attorney]], [[John Van de Kamp]],&lt;!-- note Wikipedia states Van de Kamp would have only been in office until 1981, though several articles state he was in office through at least the beginning of the 1982 discovery --&gt; said the fetuses would be individually examined and charges would be filed against the doctors if fetuses were over the 20-week [[gestation]] limit allowed by California law at the time.&lt;ref name="charges" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prosecute" /&gt; Officials found 193 fetuses that appeared to be over the 20-week limit.&lt;ref name="charges" /&gt; Van de Kamp wanted to turn the remaining fetuses over to groups who would perform memorial services on them.&lt;ref name="charges" /&gt;

In May 1982, [[California Attorney General]] [[George Deukmejian]] stated the gestation limit of the 1967 California abortion law was considered unenforceable because of conflicts with the 23-week [[Roe v. Wade]] ruling in 1973, but fetuses could be individually examined to determine viability, which was the legal limit.&lt;ref name="charges" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prosecute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deukmejian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abortion Prosecution Possible-Deukmejian: Opinion Clears Way for Van de Kamp to File Charges in Woodland Hills Case|last=Ingram|first=Carl|author2=Jacobs, Paul |date=11 May 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=OC_A1|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late May, Van de Kamp stated every fetus would be examined to determine if the fetus was aborted illegally.&lt;ref name="each"&gt;{{cite news|title=Each Stored Fetus to Be Examined: L.A. District Attorney to Decide Whether to File Charges|last=Jones|first=Jack|date=27 May 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=OC4|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==
In 1982 president [[Ronald Reagan]] wrote a letter advocating for memorial services "for these children", referring to it as "this national tragedy".&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{cite news|title=Court Clears the Way for Disposal of Fetuses|last=Hager|first=Philip|date=19 March 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=SD3|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter came in front of the judge because of a lawsuit filed against Van de Kamp by [[Carol Downer]] of the [[Los Angeles Feminist Women's Health Center]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. John Lynch, the chief deputy county counsel stated it was inappropriate to enjoin Van de Kamp, who was simply a "man in the middle", and that the lawsuit should be filed against pro-choice groups instead.&lt;ref name="release" /&gt; In June 1982, [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] judge [[Dickran Tevrizian]] issued a [[temporary restraining order]]&lt;!-- another source calls it VdK as being 'enjoined' --&gt; against Van de Kamp to prevent the unconstitutional release of the fetuses to groups for burial, but allowed him to legally dispose of the fetuses, called "vague" by John Lynch, the chief deputy county counsel.&lt;ref name="depol"&gt;{{cite news|title=Depoliticizing the Fetuses|date=11 June 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=D6|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{cite news|title=Release of Fetuses for Rites Prohibited: Judge's Injunction Forbids Van de Kamp to Allow Their Use in Religious Services|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|date=23 June 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=B3|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1982, Van de Kamp petitioned the court to allow the burial of all but the 193 late-term fetuses in [[Mass grave|common graves]] at [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]], which offered free burial.&lt;ref name="charges" /&gt;&lt;ref name="permission"&gt;{{cite news|title=Permission Sought for Burial of Fetuses|last=Rohrlich|first=Ted|date=1 October 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=OC_A4|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fetuses were not buried at Valhalla, which later stated it offered the burial plot because "the right-to-life groups came to us, and we said we wouldn't endorse any political viewpoint, but we thought that interring the bodies was a proper thing to do as a service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Valhalla Cemetery Records History of Famous, Forgotten|last=Bloom|first=Stephen|date=2 September 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=V_A6|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1982, [[Los Angeles Superior Court]] judge Eli Chernow ruled the 20-week limit was unconstitutional, also ruling that Van de Kamp could bury the fetuses and [[pro-life]] groups could hold onsite memorial services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Rejects Abortion Bar at 20 Weeks|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|date=22 December 1982|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=A1|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 1983, the district attorney was [[Robert Philibosian]], who stated he preferred a "dignified burial" and would not file charges.&lt;ref name="charges"&gt;{{cite news|title=D.A. Will Not File Charges in Deaths of 16,431 Fetuses|last=Rohrlich|first=Ted|date=20 August 1983|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=1|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prosecute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prosecute"&gt;{{cite news|title=L.A.

In July 1984, the [[California Courts of Appeal]] overturned [[Superior Court of Los Angeles County]] judge Eli Chernow, ruling the fetuses could not be buried as human remains, which was a win for [[pro-choice]] groups and feminists. The case had been appealed by [[Carol Downer]] of the [[Los Angeles Feminist Women's Health Center]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and was denounced by the California Pro-Life Medical Association, the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]]. The appealing parties argued that allowing [[Pro-life movement|pro-life]] groups to bury the remains violated the [[separation of church and state]]. The Court's opinion stated "it is clear from the record that the Catholic League is a religious organization which regards a fetus as a human being and abortion as murder. While this specific belief may well cross sectarian lines... any state action showing a preference for this belief will be strictly scrutinized and must be invalidated". Since fetal remains are normally incinerated without ceremony, there was no reason to do otherwise with these fetuses, stating "We perceive that the intended burial ceremony will enlist the prestige and power of the state. This is constitutionally forbidden." However, religious services could hold concurrent onsite memorial services, which was praised by US president [[Ronald Reagan]] in a letter to the California Pro-Life Medical Association, admiring their decision "to hold a memorial service for these children".&lt;ref name="prosecute" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appeal Court Bars Disputed Plan to Bury 16,000 Fetuses|last=Blake|first=Gene|date=3 July 1984|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=C1|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rehnquist" /&gt; Philibosian announced he would appeal the ruling allowing onsite memorial services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Region|date=10 July 1984|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=SD2|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="issue"&gt;{{cite news|title=County Will Take Fetus Issue to U.S. High Court|last=Hernandez|first=Marita|date=28 September 1984|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=D1|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1984, [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justice [[William Rehnquist]] refused to turn over the state appeals court ruling allowing the religious ceremonies.&lt;ref name="rehnquist"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Region: U.S. Supreme Court...|date=12 October 1984|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=OC2|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was officially upheld by the Supreme Court in March 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L.A.

==Pro-life service==
In May 1985, singer [[Pat Boone]] announced he recorded a song titled "Sixteen Thousand Faces" about the incident, first played at a pro-life memorial service for the fetuses at [[Live Oak Memorial Park]] in [[Monrovia, California|Monrovia]], where a granite tombstone was left with the inscription "For all those deprived of life and human love through abortion". In response, the California [[Abortion Rights Action League]] director said the service and marker "[humanized] fetuses when they deny the humanity of women already born".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boone Song Inspired by Fetus Protest|date=14 May 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=OC17|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fetuses Left Unburied Prompt Song by Pat Boone|last=Jalon|first=Allan|date=14 May 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=V_A6|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was attended by "several hundred anti-abortionists", including Representative [[Bob Dornan]] and the [[Feminists for Life]] group. At the time, the fetuses had not been disposed of.&lt;ref name="hundred"&gt;{{cite news|title=Several Hundred Anti-Abortionists Attend Service for Fetuses|last=Baker|first=Bob|date=20 May 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=C2|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposition==
In August 1985, the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]] ordered the fetuses be turned over to the Guerra-Gutirrez-Alexander Mortuary for burial.&lt;ref name="gga" /&gt; Per the court's order, the mortuary was selected because they did not have a religious affiliation.&lt;ref name="challenges" /&gt; At the time, it was noted by the [[Los Angeles County Department of Health Services]] that the fetuses had been kept in "five pine boxes". The department assured ACLU that there were no identifying marks on canisters containing the fetuses, and ACLU stated they would not object to a secular burial.&lt;ref name="gga"&gt;{{cite news|title=County Orders Burial of Controversial Fetuses|last=McGarry|first=T.W.|date=28 August 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=V_A6|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ACLU would not object, the Feminist Women's Health Center petitioned the Los Angeles Superior Court to block the burial, but the courts refused.&lt;ref name="challenges"&gt;{{cite news|title=Feminist Center Challenges Planned Burial of Fetuses|last=Townsend|first=Dorothy|date=14 September 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=V_A8|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disposition occurred on October 6, 1985, with the fetuses in six pine boxes, which were buried at the [[Odd Fellows Cemetery (Los Angeles, California)|Odd Fellows Cemetery]] in [[Boyle Heights]]. The pro-life group Feminists for Life didn't plan a full memorial service since they held a service in May, but the Americans Committed to Loving the Unwanted held a service. The Feminist Women's Health Center was dismayed over the public burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversial Fetuses to Be Buried Oct. 6: 3-Year Battle Over Interment to End in East L.A. Cemetery|last=Jalon|first=Allan|date=29 September 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=SD25|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 250 individuals attended the service, including [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors|County Supervisor]] [[Michael D. Antonovich]], who read a message from Ronald Reagan but stressed his attendance was in an unofficial capacity. Reagan's message stated "Just as the terrible toll of Gettysburg can be traced to a tragic decision of a divided Supreme Court, so also can these deaths we mourn. Once again a whole category of human beings has been ruled outside the protection of the law by a court ruling which clashed with our deepest moral convictions." Others in attendance were Representative [[Bob Dornan]], state Senate President [[David A. Roberti]], and state Representative [[Joseph Montoya (California)|Joseph Montoya]]. The pro-life group Americans Committed to Loving the Unwanted organized the service, including requesting a three-man Marine Corps [[color guard]], who placed an [[American flag]] on a box and stood at attention throughout the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fetuses Buried-With Hymns, Prayers|last=McGarry|first=TW|date=7 October 1985|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=A3|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1985-10-07/news/0330340020_1_aborted-fetuses-supreme-court-tabernacle-of-faith|title=Aborted Fetuses Get Religious Burial Reagan Sends Message To Ceremony In Los Angeles|last=|first=|date=7 October 1985|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Financial fallout==
Weisberg's Medical Analytical Laboratories received nearly $175,000 in [[Medi-Cal]] payments, with $88,000 coming from pathology tests on aborted fetuses. Of this, half of it ($44,000) was paid federally through the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). By the [[Hyde Amendment]], this money was ineligible for testing on pre-abortion or post-abortion tissue, which meant the state of California would need to pay back federal funds claimed by Weisberg and by any other laboratories, according to HHS inspector Richard P. Kusserow. Kusserow also stated "prior to its closing in April, 1981, [Medical Analytical Laboratories] had routinely submitted questionable billings under the Medi-Cal program, using an erroneous billing code.... the case lacked criminal prosecutive merit due to a lack of proof that the false billings were intentional. Because the laboratory was out of business, and its owner had declared bankruptcy, there were no assets against which to proceed for civil recovery".&lt;ref name="hhs"&gt;{{cite news|title=State May Owe U.S. Millions for Tests on Fetuses|last=Jackson|first=Robert|date=29 May 1983|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=A12|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''''Manes''''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|n|iː|z}} or '''''Di Manes''''' are [[chthonic]] deities sometimes thought to represent souls of deceased loved ones. They were associated with the ''[[Lares]]'', ''[[Lemures]],'' ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genii]]'', and ''[[Di Penates]]'' as deities (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#deus, dea, di, dii|di]]'') that pertained to domestic, local, and personal cult. They belonged broadly to the category of ''[[di inferi]]'', "those who dwell below,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Varro |authorlink=Marcus Terentius Varro |date=1938 |title=De Lingua Latina |url=https://archive.org/details/onlatinlanguage01varruoft |location=London |publisher=W. Heinemann |chapter=6.13 |page=185–7 }}, translated by Kent, Roland G.&lt;/ref&gt; the undifferentiated collective of divine dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Death |date=2010 |editor-last=Gagarin |editor-first=Michael |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome |volume=2 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195170726 |page=366 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Manes were honored during the [[Parentalia]] and [[Feralia]] in February.

The theologian [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], writing about the subject a few centuries after most of the Latin pagan references to such spirits, differentiated Manes from other types of Roman spirits:

{{quotation| [[Apuleius]] "says, indeed, that the souls of men are demons, and that men become ''[[Lares]]'' if they are good, ''[[Lemures]]'' or ''[[Larvae (Roman religion)|Larvae]]'' if they are bad, and ''Manes'' if it is uncertain whether they deserve well or ill... He also states that the blessed are called in Greek εὐδαίμονες [''eudaimones''], because they are good souls, that is to say, good demons, confirming his opinion that the souls of men are demons." |City of God, Book IX, Chapter 11&lt;ref name="Augustine"&gt;{{Citation |author=St. Augustine of Hippo |authorlink=Augustine of Hippo |year=1871 |title=City of God |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45304 |location=Edinburgh |publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark |volume=1 |page=365 |accessdate=2016-09-15 }}, translated by the Rev. Marcus Dods, M.A.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Latin spells of antiquity were often addressed to the Manes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gager |first=John G. |title=Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmhw2eVJnS0C&amp;pg=PA12 |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |isbn=978-0-19-513482-7 |pages=12–13 |accessdate=2010-08-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and inscriptions==
[[File:Stele Licinia Amias Terme 67646.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The abbreviation ''D.M.'' at the top of this 3rd-century Christian tombstone stands for ''Diis Manibus'', "to the Spirits of the Dead"]]
Manes may be derived from "an archaic adjective manus —''good''— which was the opposite of immanis (monstrous)".&lt;ref name="Larousse"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Aldington |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Aldington |last2=Ames |first2=Delano |authorlink2=Delano Ames |year=1968 |title=New Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology |location=Yugoslavia |publisher=[[Hamlyn (publishers)|Hamlyn Publishing Group Ltd]] |page=213 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman tombstones often included the letters ''D.M.'', which stood for ''diis manibus'', "for the ghost-gods" or figuratively translated, "for the Manes", an abbreviation that continued to appear even in Christian inscriptions.

The Manes were offered blood sacrifices. The [[gladiator|gladiatorial games]], originally held at funerals, may have been instituted in the honor of the Manes. According to [[Cicero]], the ''Manes'' could be called forth from the caves near [[Lake Avernus]].&lt;ref name="Larousse" /&gt;

==Lapis manalis==
{{Main|Lapis manalis}}
When a new town was founded, a round hole would be dug  and a stone called a ''lapis manalis'' would be placed in the foundations, representing a gate to the [[Hades|underworld]].&lt;ref name="Larousse" /&gt; Due to similar names,  the ''lapis manalis'' is often confused with the ''lapis manilis'' in commentaries even in antiquity: "The 'flowing stone' … must not be confused with the stone of the same name which, according to [[Festus (historian)|Festus]], was the gateway to the underworld."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Burriss |first=Eli Edward |date=1931 |title=Taboo, Magic, Spirits:  A Study of Primitive Elements in Roman Religion |location=New York City |publisher=Macmillan Company |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tms/tms06.htm#fr_365 |page=365 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyril Bailey writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Of this we have a characteristic example in the ceremony of the ''[[aquaelicium]]'', designed to produce rain after a long drought. In classical times the ceremony consisted in a procession headed by the [[College of Pontiffs|pontifices]], which bore the sacred [[rain-stone]] from its resting-place by the [[Porta Capena]] to the [[Capitolium|Capitol]], where offerings were made to the sky-deity, Iuppiter, but from the analogy of other primitive cults and the sacred title of the stone (''[[lapis manalis]]''), it is practically certain that the original ritual was the purely imitative process of pouring water over the stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bailey |first=Cyril |date=1907 |title=The Religion of Ancient Rome |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18564 |location=London |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co.

'''Manuel Komnenos''' ({{Lang-gr|Μανουήλ Κομνηνός}}, ''Manouēl Komnēnos''; {{circa|1045}} – 17 April 1071) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] aristocrat and military leader, the oldest son of [[John Komnenos (Domestic of the Schools)|John Komnenos]] and brother of emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]]. A relative by marriage of emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]], he was placed in charge of expeditions against [[Seljuq Turks|Turkish]] raids in 1070–1071, until his sudden death by illness in April 1071.

==Life and career==
Manuel was the first-born child of [[John Komnenos (Domestic of the Schools)|John Komnenos]], and his wife [[Anna Dalassene]].{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=61}} The date of his birth is unknown, but he was described as a youth in 1068, so he must have been born around 1045.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=61}} Already as a child, as was customary for children of the Byzantine aristocracy, he was trained in war by his father, who at the time was ''[[domestikos ton scholon]]'' (commander-in-chief) of the Eastern field army.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=61 (note 4)}} By 1068 Manuel held the high court rank of ''[[protoproedros]]''. In that year he married a relative of Emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] ({{reign|1068|1071}}), who on the occasion raised him further to ''[[kouropalates]]'' and appointed him to the military post of ''[[protostrator]]''.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=61–62}} The couple had at least one daughter, most likely named Anna after Manuel's mother.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=63–64}}

As ''protostrator'', Manuel confronted the raids of the [[Seljuq Turks]] into eastern [[Asia Minor]]. In one such skirmish in 1070, he foolhardily pressed ahead to the Turkish camp, and was captured after a bitter struggle. His loss led to the defeat of his army and the capture of his two lieutenants and brothers-in-law, [[Michael Taronites]] and [[Nikephoros Melissenos]].{{sfn|Varzos|1984|pp=62–63}} Brought before the Turkish leader, a certain [[Chrysoskoulos]], Manuel managed to inflame his ambition and raise him in revolt against his nominal sovereign, [[Sultan]] [[Alp Arslan]] ({{reign|1063|1072}}). Indeed, Chrysoskoulos accompanied his captives to the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]], where Romanos IV received them with much honour.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=63}}

In spring 1071, Manuel and Chrysoskoulos went on campaign together against the Seljuqs, but on the way Manuel fell heavily ill with an [[ear infection]] in [[Bithynia]]. His mother hurried to his side at the monastery of Theotokos of Alypos on Mt. Azalas, but arrived barely in time for him to bid her farewell before he died.{{sfn|Varzos|1984|p=63}} According to the late 12th-century ''[[typikon]]'' of the [[Monastery of Christ Philanthropos]], founded by Empress [[Irene Doukaina]], wife of Manuel's younger brother [[Alexios I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1081|1118}}),{{sfn|Kouroupou|Vannier|2005|pp=41ff.}} he died on 17 April (the day of his commemoration).{{sfn|Kouroupou|Vannier|2005|p=60}} In the ''typikon'', he is listed as a ''[[sebastos]]'', but this is an anachronism reflecting later practice.{{sfn|Kouroupou|Vannier|2005|p=60}}

'''NASA Categories of Evidence''' comprise a matrix or scale denoting the sources of evidence provided in the [[Human Research Program]]'s various [[evidence]] reports, and thus potentially their [[probative]] value and [[efficacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/Evidence/ NASA Categories of Evidence]&lt;/ref&gt; Authors in the Program were urged to label their evidence according to whether it was based on [[controlled experiment]]s, [[observation]], or [[expert opinion]].

In Mars 8, 1948, during the Battle of Bokshiq, Ndue Perlleshi, along Shaban Dema and Ndrec Nikolla, fought Montenegrin and Albanian communist forces numbering 600. Perlleshi killed 27 communists, and wounded many others, and both his comrades died. He survived with four wounds and returned to his home until Janko Boric, the local community leader, spotted him and threw a grenade through his window. Perlleshi quickly grabbed it and tossed it back to Boric wounding him. Ndue Perlleshi was killed on August 29, 1949 in Albania by the communist forces of Mehmet Shehu. Ndue Perlleshi is a much honoured hero amongst the Albanians of [[Dukagjin highlands|Dukagjin]] and [[District of Peć|Peja]]-region. He is mentioned in Albanian epic folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trepca.net/2003/0703/030718-tm-nacionalisti-ndue.perlleshi.htm|title=Nacionalisti Ndue Perlleshi (1908-1949) ra dëshmor me ëndrrën e pashuar për Shqiperinë Etnike|website=www.trepca.net|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dilthey1-4.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Wilhelm Dilthey]]]]

There are at least two senses in which the term [[philosophy]] is used: a formal and an informal sense. In the formal sense, philosophy is an academic study of the fields of [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], as well as [[Social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]]. One's "'''philosophy of life'''" is philosophy in the informal sense, as a personal philosophy, whose focus is resolving the [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fetler, ''Philosophy and Philosophy of Religion Charts'', Sun Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  

"Philosophy of life" also refers to a specific conception of philosophizing as a [[way of life]],&lt;ref name="Hadot"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/hadot/ Pierre Hadot (1922-2010)] by Matthew Sharpe in the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the German ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' movement whose main representative is [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott Campbell, Paul W. Bruno (eds.), ''The Science, Politics, and Ontology of Life-Philosophy'', Bloomsbury, 2013, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and several other [[Continental philosophers]] such as [[Henri Bergson]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Chase, Stephen R. L. Clark, Michael McGhee (eds.), ''Philosophy as a Way of Life: Ancients and Moderns – Essays in Honor of Pierre Hadot'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Hadot]].&lt;ref name="Hadot"/&gt;

==The human situation==
{{prose|section|date=April 2013}}

{{Main|Human situation}}
The human situation appears to be a struggle between what ''is'' (existence) and what ''ought'' (essence) to be.
* [[Normative situation]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Alternative lifestyle|Alternatives]], [[Choice]], [[Liberty|Freedom]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|Values]], [[Moral code|Standards]], [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideals]], [[Obligation]], [[Moral responsibility|Responsibility]]
* [[Existential predicament]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Finitude]], [[Social alienation|Alienation]], [[Anxiety]], [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]], [[Ambivalence]], [[Thrownness]]

==Main answers to the existential question==
There are at least three prevailing theories on how to respond to the existential question.

===Denial of essence===
* [[Nihilism]], denial of meaning

===Denial of existence===
* [[Essentialism]]

===Affirmation of life===
* [[Secular humanism]]
* [[Religion]]

==Religion as an attempt to overcome the existential predicament==
There are two basic forms of [[existentialism]]:

===Religious existentialism===
{{Main|Christian existentialism}}

Religious existentialism is best exemplified by [[St. Augustine]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Paul Tillich]], and the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. Religious existentialism holds that there are two levels of reality, essence, which is the ground of [[being]], and existence. Religion is the ultimate concern in this view.

===Atheistic existentialism===
{{Main|Atheistic existentialism}}

Atheistic existentialism is best exemplified by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. It holds that there is one level of reality, existence. In this view, each person constructs his own unique and temporary essence.

'''Perry Ray Robinson''' (12 September 1937 – c. 25 April 1973), was an American civil rights activist from Alabama during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. He had been active in Mississippi and Washington, DC, supporting the [[March on Washington]] and the [[Poor People's Campaign]]. He disappeared while participating in the 1973 
[[American Indian Movement]] resistance in the [[Wounded Knee incident]] on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in [[South Dakota]].

His family never saw him again, and his wife believed he was killed there. She struggled to get Robinson's disappearance investigated. In 2014 the FBI confirmed that Robinson had been killed and buried on the reservation in April 1973; it released redacted documents to the Robinson family under a [[Freedom of Information Act]] suit, including redacted interviews with cooperating witnesses. His remains have not been found. The FBI said it had closed his case.

==Early life==
Ray Robinson was born on 12 September 1937 in [[Bogue Chitto, Alabama|Bogue Chitto]], [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name="Indian Country News #1" /&gt; He attended local segregated schools. Strong and athletic, he became a prize fighter.&lt;ref name="Indian Country News #2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiancountrynews.com/index.php/investigations/ray-robinson/887-a-follower-of-martin-luther-king-jr-might-be-buried-at-wounded-knee |title=A follower of Martin Luther King Jr. might be buried at Wounded Knee. |work=Indian Country News |first=Carson |last=Walker |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
After leaving boxing, Robinson became a civil rights activist and follower of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] He participated in the 1963 [[March on Washington]] and heard King's noted speech, ''[[I Have a Dream]].''&lt;ref name="NewsOne" /&gt; Robinson attended the funerals held for [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|three civil rights workers killed]] in 1964 in [[Mississippi]]. He participated in organizing [[Poor People's Campaign|Resurrection City]], a camp set up in 1968 at the [[Washington Mall]] to draw attention to the plight of poor people of color in the [[United States]].

Robinson was affiliated with [[Bradford Lyttle]], the founder of the [[United States Pacifist Party]]. Lyttle said about Robinson, "He was quite forthcoming and very vigorous and willing to take risks. He put himself out in front of the project. And we decided we would take him on into the South."&lt;ref name="JFAMR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jfamr.org/raymlk.html |title=Slain Activist Had Roots In Civil Rights Movement  |work=JFAMR, first printed in ''Indian Country News'' |first=Carson |last=Walker |date=16 January 2004 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose Sanders (since 2003 known as [[Faya Ora Rose Touré]]),&lt;ref name="jrank"&gt;[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2993/Tour-Faya-Ora-Rose.html "Faya Ora Rose Toure"], JRank&lt;/ref&gt; the first black female judge in the state of [[Alabama]], described Robinson as being called to the civil rights movement. She said in a 2004 telephone interview: "He was a true soldier. He was a true liberator. He really believed all people should be free."&lt;ref name="Indian Country News #2" /&gt;

In the late 1960s Robinson also supported the [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]] (VVAW), organized in 1967. While participating in a 1966 anti-war rally in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]], he met Cheryl Buswell; they later married.&lt;ref name="Michigan Radio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://michiganradio.org/post/detroit-family-inches-toward-answers-mystery-civil-rights-activist-s-disappearance |title=Detroit family inches toward answers in mystery of civil rights activist’s disappearance |work=Michigan Radio |first=Sarah |last=Hulett |date=10 March 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been raised in a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] household, but dropped out of college to become politically active.&lt;ref name="JFAMR" /&gt;

Buswell returned with Robinson to Alabama, where they worked in grassroots movements for education and nutrition. They lived in [[Selma, Alabama]], and had three children together from 1967 to 1972.&lt;ref name="JFAMR" /&gt;

During a 1973 meeting of VVAW, Robinson learned of the [[Wounded Knee Incident|ongoing occupation]] of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota]] by [[American Indian Movement]] activists at the [[Pine Ridge Reservation]] to protest federal government policies.&lt;ref name="Red Cloud Indian School"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redcloudschool.org/reservation |title=OUR STORY, OUR SUCCESS WIČHÓOYAKE NA WÓOKIHI UŊKÍTȞAWAPI KIŊ |work=Red Cloud Indian School |first= |last= |date= |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIM was appealing for supporters. According to his wife, Robinson decided to go to the reservation to support the occupation and work to align the rights movements of both groups of people of color.&lt;ref name="Michigan Radio" /&gt; Four African Americans from Alabama went to Pine Ridge; three returned.

==Disappearance==
Cheryl Robinson never saw her husband again. She filed a missing person's report with the [[FBI]] and in October 1974 traveled to AIM offices in [[Rapid City, South Dakota]] and its headquarters in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], but was not able to learn much more about her husband's fate. Most AIM representatives denied knowing of him being at Wounded Knee. She hired an investigator, Barbara Deming, and was told that her husband had backpacked into Wounded Knee during the night in order to avoid checkpoints. One person said that he was shot after failing to follow an order to report to one of the AIM leaders.&lt;ref name="FrontPage Mag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/2014/dgreenfield/fbi-confirms-black-civil-rights-activist-was-murdered-by-aim-at-wounded-knee/ |title=FBI Confirms Black Civil Rights Activist was Murdered by AIM at Wounded Knee |work=FrontPageMag |first=Daniel |last=Greenfield |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deming and Robinson corresponded for some time.

In 2011, Buffalo-based attorney [[Michael Kuzma]] filed a FOIA request with the FBI for records concerning Robinson's disappearance.  In 2013, Kuzma filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York to gain full access to documents about the case.

Robinson was later declared [[Declared death in absentia|legally dead]]&lt;ref name="Missing Persons of America"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.missingpersonsofamerica.com/2013/07/ray-robinson-whatever-happened-to-civil.html |title=Ray Robinson: Whatever happened to the civil rights activist at Wounded Knee?  |work=Missing Persons of America |first= |last= |date=15 July 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his burial site has not been discovered, and his body has never been recovered.&lt;ref name="The Grio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thegrio.com/2014/02/20/fbi-confirms-activist-ray-robinson-was-killed-in-south-dakota-in-1973/#s:ray-robinson-widow |title=FBI confirms activist Ray Robinson was killed in South Dakota in 1973 |work=The Grio |first=Dirk |last=Lammers |date=20 February 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicting accounts==
[[Dennis Banks]], then a top leader within the [[American Indian Movement]], claimed that he had no knowledge of Ray Robinson. He said that he had never met him and learned of his being at Wounded Knee only through inquiries by his family members. "Over the years, the Robinson name has popped up and I’m not sure even who would have that information or where it was. That’s a complete blank to me."&lt;ref name="NewsOne" /&gt;

But in 2001, [[Darlene Ka-Mook Nichols|Darlene (Ka-Mook) Nichols]], formerly Banks' [[common-law]] wife in the 1970s, interviewed him while trying to learn more about the 1975 murder of AIM activist [[Anna Mae Aquash]]. Banks happened to discuss Robinson, saying that he had been shot by another [[American Indian Movement|AIM]] officer and bled to death because the group was under siege and had no way to treat him adequately. Banks said he saw Robinson's body and ordered a subordinate, Chris Westerman, to "bury him where no one will know."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; He said Westerman was "gone for about five hours" and that Robinson had been buried "over by the creek."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/magazine/who-killed-anna-mae.html?_r=1 |title=Who Killed Anna Mae? |work=NYTimes |first=Erik |last=Konigsberg |date=25 April 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Westerman is the brother of activist, actor and musician [[Floyd Red Crow Westerman|Floyd Westerman]].)&lt;ref name="Indian Country News #3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiancountrynews.com/index.php/investigations/ray-robinson/889-bernie-lafferty-speaks-about-ray-robinsons-killing-inside-wounded-knee-1973 |title=Bernie Lafferty speaks about Ray Robinson's killing inside Wounded Knee 1973 |work=Indian Country News |first= |last= |date=17 July 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another account, Banks claimed that [[Harry Hill (activist)|Harry "Mr. X" David Hill]] shot Robinson.&lt;ref name="Indian Country News" /&gt;  However FBI files show David Hill had already left Wounded Knee in early March and Robinson was allegedly killed in April.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=March 2016}}  According to Paul DeMain, FBI files show Hill was under FBI surveillance at the time of the alleged killing.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=March 2016}}

Over time, other rumors and information surfaced. At a time of high suspicion of outsiders, many in AIM were said to have believed Robinson had been an FBI [[informant]].&lt;ref name="Indianz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianz.com/News/2011/001223.asp |title=Stew Magnuson: The 1973 disappearance of Ray Robinson |work=Indianz |first=Stew |last=Magnuson |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publisher Paul DeMain reported that a former AIM member described Robinson to him as a "loud mouthed nigger, who refused to pick up a gun during a firefight," making him suspect.&lt;ref name="Michigan Radio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OneidaEye"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oneidaeye.com/2013/09/29/perry-ray-robinson-jr-other-aim-victims/ |title=Perry Ray Robinson Jr. &amp; Other AIM Victims |work=Oneida Eye |first= |last= |date=29 September 2013 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 AIM leader [[Carter Camp]] told Robinson's daughters that the [[Guardians of the Oglala Nation]], commonly known on the reservation as GOONs, killed their father. They had previously been established by a reservation leader who was opposed by many activists.&lt;ref name="Indianz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stew Magnunson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stewmagnuson.blogspot.com/2011/04/its-time-for-vigorous-investigation.html |title=It’s Time for a Vigorous Investigation into Ray Robinson’s Mysterious Disappearance |work=Stew Magnunson |first=Stew |last=Magnuson |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activist [[John Trimbach]] criticized this account for distorting the history of the [[Wounded Knee incident]] and failing to provide substantive evidence of the allegations.&lt;ref name="Indianz #2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianz.com/News/2013/009848.asp |title=John Trimbach: Even more distortions of Wounded Knee '73 |work=Indianz |first=John |last=Trimbach |date=27 May 2013 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Robinson's daughter Tamara Kamara, worked with attorney Michael Kuzma in [[Buffalo, New York]] where she lived, to file a [[Freedom of Information]] suit against the FBI and government to force the release of relevant documents. Her mother and remaining family were then living in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].

==FBI documents released in 2014==
On 11 March 2014, the FBI released documents to the Robinson lawyer Michael Kuzma confirming the death of a black civil rights activist during the 1973 AIM occupation of [[Wounded Knee incident|Wounded Knee]].&lt;ref name="Indian Country News #1" /&gt; A memorandum from the [[FBI]] dated 21 May 1973 reported that an Indian woman who had left the village said there were 200 Indians, 11 whites and two blacks in the occupation. Robinson was reported as having been accompanied to the siege by a black woman. She returned to her home town, but he disappeared.&lt;ref name="Commercial Appeal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/widow-civil-rights-activist-wants-him-home# |title=Widow of civil rights activist wants him home |work=Commercial Appeal |first= |last= |date=27 April 2012 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Robinson family lawyer said FBI files included statements that 'Robinson had been tortured and murdered within the AIM occupation perimeter, and then his remains were buried "in the hills."'&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2563427/Civil-rights-activist-disappeared-1973-tortured-murdered-members-American-Indian-Movement-trying-HELP-newly-released-FBI-documents-claim.html#ixzz3B97Cj7BJ |title=Civil rights activist who disappeared in 1973 was 'tortured and murdered by members of American Indian Movement he was trying to HELP,' newly released FBI documents claim |work=Daily Mail |first=Helen |last=Pow |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One witness interviewed by FBI agents said that Robinson had been in Wounded Knee for approximately a week before his death. During this time, the witness said that Robinson had trouble adapting to the harsh conditions and discipline imposed under the siege.&lt;ref name="NYPost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2014/02/19/fbi-confirms-civil-rights-activist-was-killed-in-1973-wounded-knee-protest/ |title=FBI confirms civil rights activist was killed in 1973 Wounded Knee protest |work=NYPost |first= |last= |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions included a shortage of food, constant surveillance, regular shootings as the occupation was "under fire," and the unilateral AIM command.&lt;ref name="Rapid City Journal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/fbi-confirms-activist-was-killed-in-south-dakota-in/article_bc2fcdea-9991-11e3-b052-0019bb2963f4.html |title=FBI confirms activist was killed in South Dakota in 1973 |work=Rapid City Journal |first= |last= |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The witness said Robinson tried to discuss strategies, but no one listened or gave him any serious consideration. After he got into a heated exchange with another activist, he was escorted to a house by a security team.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; There Robinson grabbed a butcher knife from a table and the team gathered around him. The witness said, "The next thing, I heard a loud bang and saw Mr. Robinson’s lower leg spin from the knee and rotate outward as he started to fall forward. His eyes rolled up as he went down."&lt;ref name="NYPost" /&gt; The security team is alleged to have consisted of, among other members, [[Leonard Crow Dog]], [[Carter Camp]], [[Dennis Banks]], [[Frank Blackhorse]], [[Stan Holder]], [[Harry Hill (activist)|Harry David Hill]], and [[Clyde Bellecourt]]. According to Bernie Lafferty, a witness who confirmed Robinson's presence on the reservation during the Wounded Knee incident, during an evening meeting, several AIM members openly discussed the murder of a [[African-American|Black]] man whom they had buried on the hillside. These members included Banks, Camp, [[Russell Means]], Holder and Hill.&lt;ref name="Indian Country News #3" /&gt;

Robinson had adopted a non-violent philosophy in his civil rights work. This position put him at odds with AIM, which conducted armed resistance to the federal government. This likely added to existing suspicions of him as an outsider to the Indian movement. The Pine Ridge Reservation had already been disrupted because of severe internal political conflict over the leadership of Richard Wilson.&lt;ref name="Michigan Radio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-confirms-activist-ray-robinson-was-killed-during-1973-occupation-of-wounded-knee/ |title=FBI confirms black activist was killed during 1973 occupation of Wounded Knee |work=CBS |first= |last= |date=20 February 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later AIM member [[Richard Two Elk]] described Robinson's behavior: "He would eat what little food we had. There was no food so everyone was trying not to eat and this guy was eating freely all the time."&lt;ref name="JFAMR" /&gt; AIM members resented his actions.

Buswell-Robinson learned of some accounts of her husband from Barbara Deming's research. They corresponded in 1974. "He was sitting on somebody’s porch eating oatmeal. An Indian dude came up, ordered him to go see Dennis Banks. Ray said: ‘In a minute – I’m eating my oatmeal – I’ll go when I’ve finished.’ The Indian dude got affronted by Ray's lack of servility. The Indian shot Ray dead," Cheryl Robinson wrote.&lt;ref name="FrontPage Mag" /&gt; Cheryl Buswell-Robinson said of her husband, "Ray did not respond well to that authoritative direction."&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt;

[[Richard Two Elk]] said that Robinson was the aggressor at the time he was shot. "I think it was just a reaction. He jumped up and he had a knife and started moving and someone reacted. It happened in a couple of seconds. I think it was someone's gut level reaction in the middle of a firefight."&lt;ref name="JFAMR" /&gt; Two Elk also said, "One of the things that was quite apparent was the conflict and the clash of the two concepts of social rights-civil rights and Indian rights. Indian rights are in a whole different context. They (blacks) were coming from rights within the system and Indian rights was about sovereignty and independent nations." &lt;ref name="JFAMR" /&gt;

Another account said that Robinson was shot in the knee after the security team entered the bunker. He was dragged outside, beaten and taken to the Wounded Knee Medical Clinic. This was run by [[Madonna Thunder Hawk|Madonna Gilbert Thunderhawk]] and [[Lorelei DeCora Means]], as well as several other volunteer nurses and medics, including non-Indians. Ray was reportedly held in a closet, where he bled to death.&lt;ref name="First Thoughts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.first-thoughts.org/on/American+Indian+Movement/Wounded+Knee/ |title=American Indian Movement &amp; Wounded Knee |work=First Thoughts |first=Dirk |last=Lammers |date= |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In correspondence with AIM members, Camp noted that he left Ray in Eagle Bunker after he had been shot in both legs. Camp said, "I had to make the decision not to bring in Buddy Lamont until late afternoon after I knew he was killed in the early morning. I had to leave Ray's life to fight alone in eagle bunker after he was shot through both legs. I did these things to save other Indian lives."&lt;ref name="Indian Country News" /&gt;

[[American Indian Movement|AIM]] co-founder [[Clyde Bellecourt]], who was at Wounded Knee for 51 days of the siege, said that he had not heard of Robinson during AIM's occupation. He only learned of the activist's name in the fall of 2013 after being approached by his widow Cheryl Buswell-Robinson.&lt;ref name="Michigan Radio" /&gt;

The late [[Vernon Bellecourt]], older brother of Clyde and leader of an AIM chapter, was said to have known of Robinson's murder during the occupation. He reportedly said at one time that AIM had "really managed to keep a tight lid on that one over the years."&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/19/fbi-suspects-native-americans-ray-robinson-civil-rights-activist |title=FBI suspects militant Native Americans killed black civil rights activist in 1973 |work=The Guardian |first=Dirk |last=Lammers |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Robinson is survived by his widow, Cheryl Buswell-Robinson,&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/27/ray-robinson-missing-civil-rights-activist_n_1458484.html |title=Widow Of Civil Rights Activist Ray Robinson Wants Him Home |work=Huffington Post |first=Dirk |last=Lammers |date=27 April 2012 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their three children, daughters Desiree Mark and Tamara Kamara, and son J. Marc Robinson.&lt;ref name="JFAMR" /&gt;

==Representation in other media==
The 2009 [[PBS]] documentary, ''[[We Shall Remain|We Shall Remain: Wounded Knee]],'' covered the [[American Indian Movement]] during and through the Wounded Knee Incident, as part of a history of Native Americans. This episode was criticized at the time in a 6-page letter to PBS management signed by [[Joseph H. Trimbach]], former FBI Special Agent-in-Charge at the time of the events, his son John M. Trimbach, and five Native Americans who had been involved at Wounded Knee; they said AIM violence had not been fully portrayed and noted the allegations about AIM responsibility for Robinson's and others' deaths on the reservation, as well as the 1975 murder of leader [[Annie Mae Aquash]], had been glossed over. (By this time Trimbach father and son had published their own book about AIM.) The PBS Ombudsman discussed their objections and carried their letter on his webpage on May 20, 2009.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/ombudsman/2009/05/burying_some_questions_at_wounded_knee_1.html |title=Burying Some Questions at Wounded Knee |author=Michael Getler |work =PBS Ombudsman |first= |last= |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Barbara Nixon wrote a book about the events of Wounded Knee, entitled ''Mi' Taku'Ye-Oyasin: Letters from Wounded Knee'' (2014). [[Mitakuye Oyasin|Mi' Taku'Ye-Oyasin]] is a phrase in Lakota that means "All My Relations," referring to the concept of interconnectedness among the people.&lt;ref name="Mitakuye Oyasin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitakuyeoyasin.net/about/ |title=Mitakuye Oyasin |work=Mitakuye Oyasin |first= |last= |date= |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included several letters related to Robinson.&lt;ref name="GoogleBooks"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0B-YLDp01HAC&amp;pg=PA596&amp;lpg=PA596&amp;ots=DtzAD-Z2ZW&amp;sig=sibJWspjR_rjDNkaEuMf7posbs0&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=barbara%20nixon%20perry%20ray%20robinson |title=Mi' Taku'Ye-Oyasin: Letters from Wounded Knee |work=Mi' Taku'Ye-Oyasin: Letters from Wounded Knee |first=Barbara |last=Nixon |date=13 April 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Vibroana''' ({{lang-es|Serpentario Viborana}}) is a privately operated [[Herpetarium|serpentarium]], rescue centre and [[environmental education]] facility located near [[Turrialba Volcano]] in the [[Cartago Province]] of [[Costa Rica]].  The centre is dedicated to the rehabilitation of mistreated, injured, orphaned, and/or confiscated snakes, focusing primarily on venomous species.&lt;ref name=population&gt;{{cite web

Visitors are permitted in the centre during certain times each day. The center was created and is run by Minor Camacho, a Costa Rican [[Herpetology|herpatologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jean McNeil|first= Keith Drew|date= 2012|title= The Rough Guide to Costa Rica|url=|location= |publisher= [[Penguin Books]]|page= 149|isbn=1405392010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The educational guide explores the natural history and habitat of poisonous snakes more than their taxonomy.&lt;ref name=population /&gt;

The Viborana centre also doubles as a snake call centre, with the owner and staff going out to homes to remove venomous snakes from places where they might inconvenience people.&lt;ref name=population /&gt;

== History ==
Founded by Minor Camacho Loaiza, a former reptile handler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Blake|first= Beatrice |date= 2009|title= The New Key to Costa Rica|url=|location= |publisher= Ulysses Press|page= 194|isbn=1569756961}}&lt;/ref&gt; trained at the [[University of Costa Rica]] and former chief of the Herpetarium division of the Department of Biochemistry of that University. The centre began as a [[herpetarium]] exhibition for [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. Inspired on research findings that suggested an increase in snake populations around the Pacurare River sugarcane landscapes, the herpetarium redirected its focus towards the study of the dynamics of the Natural History of snakes in the fields of Cartago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Exhibits ==
The centre is devoted to [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] reptiles. Many are collected from local homes, yards, or from areas about to be burned under the controlled burning program to keep summer [[grass fire]]s from threatening the local homes. Most of the reptiles end up being relocated to uninhabited areas. 

Animals at the centre include the ''[[Bothrops lanceolatus]]'' — known as the ''fer-de-lance''; ''[[Bothriechis schlegelii]]'', the eyelash viper; large and small [[Pythonidae|pythons]], [[coral snake]]s, and [[rattlesnake]]s, among others.

'''Stegron the Dinosaur Man''' is a fictional supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Gil Kane]], the character first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #19 (March 1974).
 
==Fictional character biography==
Vincent Stegron was hired by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to work with [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] to study [[DNA]] of dinosaurs from the [[Savage Land]]. Inspired by the experiment that turned Connors into the Lizard, Stegron stole some dinosaur DNA and injected himself with it. In moments Stegron transformed into an orange semi-humanoid ''[[Stegosaurus]]''-like creature. Stegron gained the ability to command real dinosaurs, and he planned to use them in his plans for conquest of the world and converting all of humanity into creatures like himself. Taking several dinosaurs with him from the Savage Land to New York City, he encountered Spider-Man, [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], and [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]]. During the battle that followed, Stegron was beaten by being knocked into a nearby river and seemingly drowning.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #19–20. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Months later, Stegron returned and blackmailed Connors into helping him restore several dinosaur remains from a museum. Connors did what Stegron asked and accidentally turned into the Lizard. The two reptile-men clashed as Spider-Man arrived and later Stegron was sent into hibernation by the extremely cold temperatures the weather was producing.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #165–166. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Months later Stegron, now back in his human form, woke from hibernation and wandered New York. During a battle between the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and Spider-Man, Stegron regained his dinosaur form and powers and joined many of Spider-Man's enemies (including [[Doctor Octopus]], Vulture, [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]], [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Answer (comics)#Answer (Aaron Nicholson)|Answer]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Ringer (comics)|Strikeback]], and [[Leila Davis|Hardshell]]) in an all-out battle to defeat him. Stegron was knocked unconscious and was taken in by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lethal Foes of Spider-Man]]'' #1–4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:StegronMarvel3.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Stegron battling Spider-Man]]
Stegron eventually returned to the Savage Land, where he took over a S.H.I.E.L.D. installation which drew the attention of [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]], Black Widow, and Black Panther. During the battle over the installation, Stegron was forced into an extremely cold environment and again went into hibernation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]]'' #20. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime later, Stegron managed to awaken from his slumber and terrorized [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] (who was illegally drilling in the Savage Land). Soon, Stegron was opposed by Ka-Zar, [[Shanna the She-Devil]], and Spider-Man. During the battle, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and a gigantic bird/ox-like creature known as [[Chtylok]] arrived and helped Stegron fight Roxxon Oil. The heroes joined forces with Stegron when they realized he was trying to protect the Savage Land. Eventually, Stegron managed to scare the Roxxon agents and was left in peace in the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sensational Spider-Man]]'' #13–15. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, Stegron (reverted to his human form) exiled himself to wander the Arctic Circle when he stumbled upon the Rock of Life. Inspired by its de-evolving abilities, he took it with him back to New York where he slowly began to transform back into his dinosaur form. He then sent the Rock to a friend of his, who then put it on display at the Museum of Natural History in hopes that it would devolve the inhabitants of New York City into prehistoric creatures like himself with him as their leader. As a result, various heroes and villains with connections to the animal kingdom such as Spider-Man, [[Puma (comics)|Puma]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], Vulture, Lizard, [[John Jameson (comics)|Man-Wolf]], and [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]] were affected by its power, causing an increase in their savagery. Spider-Man maintained control, and he discovered Stegron's plans at the museum where the two battled. With the help of [[Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Invisible Woman]], Spider-Man managed to stop the Rock's powers from reaching others in New York using a piece of his armor. He then beat Stegron into submission. Stegron was then taken into custody by the authorities as the [[Fantastic Four]] placed the Rock in a secure vault in the Baxter Building.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #23–27. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stegron again returned to the Savage Land, but shortly after his return, Roxxon Oil attacked again, intent on obtaining [[vibranium]]. Stegron was recruited by Ka-Zar and [[Brainchild (comics)|Brainchild]] to help fight the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Comics Presents'' (vol. 2) #6–7. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stegron was later seen in the [[Negative Zone]]'s Prison during the 2008 "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four]]'' #3 (2008). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Somehow, he escaped and returned to the Savage Land. While there he happened upon the starving [[Devil Dinosaur]], who had slumped into a depression after his companion [[Moon-Boy]] was kidnapped by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. Fearing for the survival of the beast (as it was the last of its species), Stegron left the Savage Land without informing Ka-Zar to wage war on S.H.I.E.L.D. Building an army of reanimated dinosaurs, Stegron marched across the US, attacking military base after base, searching for the missing primate. He met little opposition. His only serious challenge coming from attacks by the [[Fifty State Initiative]]. Eventually, due to the help of their new recruit [[Reptil]], Stegron was defeated and taken into custody. Learning the motive behind his attack, they agreed to return Moon Boy to the Savage Land to be reunited with his companion.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers the Initiative: Featuring Reptil''. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stegron later collaborates with [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] in a plan to turn humanity into dinosaurs where they fought Spider-Man and the mutant students from the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. The duo's plans are unraveled by their own infighting, purposely exacerbated by their mutual crush Shark Girl who caused their powers to neutralize each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Elliott Kalan|penciller = Marco Failla|inker = Marco Failla|colorist = Ian Herring|letterer = Clayton Cowles|editor = Katie Kubert|title = Spider-Man and the X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #1|date =  February 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Elliott Kalan|penciller = Marco Failla|inker = Marco Failla|colorist = Ian Herring|letterer = Clayton Cowles|editor = Katie Kubert|title = Spider-Man and the X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = March 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stegron is later revealed as the mastermind behind a monster attack on a church. After [[Eddie Brock]] discovers one of Stegron's dinosaurs and delivers it to [[Liz Allan]], CEO of [[Alchemax]], he heads down the sewers and finds his lair, until he is spotted and captured.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' #151. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Venom then manages to escape with help from Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur, who were investigating the dinosaur attacks. When Venom and Moon Girl return to the hideout, Stegron takes control of Devil Dinosaur and sends him to attack them.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' #152. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Stegron revealed that he had earlier been hired by Alchemax to find a way to have healing factors placed in humans which led to him doing his dinosaur serum experiments on homeless people and wild animals. Before Stegron can dump the dinosaur serum into the water supply, Venom and Moon Girl worked together to free Devil Dinosaur from Stegron's control and defeat Stegron who was placed in Alchemax's custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' #153. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his Dinosaur People creations still resided underground.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' #154. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Stegron has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and durability. Stegron possesses a prehensile tail, which he can use as a weapon or to grasp items, as well as sharp claws and teeth. His skin is very durable and is virtually bulletproof. Stegron also has the mental ability to control or manipulate any dinosaur in an unknown area around him. He has exhibited the power to control or manipulate the reptilian part of the brain in any life form.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

During their ill-fated alliance, Sauron granted Stegron the ability to drain life force from others through physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man and the X-Men'' #1-2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like reptiles, Stegron is vulnerable to cold temperatures.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

==Other versions==
In the ''[[Marvel Adventures]]'' universe, the Avengers encounter Stegron in the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Adventures: The Avengers'' #33. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, a variation of Stegron lives in the [[Battleworld]] domain of Spider-Island. When Vincent Stegron is infected by the [[Spider Queen]]'s Spider Virus, he is inducted into her Brain Trust. This lasts until Agent Venom and his Resistance attacks their base, where Agent Venom gives Vincent Stegron a serum that transforms him into Stegron, as he sides with the Resistance.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Spider-Island]]'' #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Stegron later works with Iron Goblin on a retro-generation ray as the Resistance had to relocate to Avengers Mansion.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Island'' #3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Stegron later breaks into the American Museum of Natural History, where he uses the retro-generation ray on the dinosaur remains, bringing the dinosaurs there back to life.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Island'' #4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After Agent Venom and his symbiote sacrifice their lives to get the Spider Queen to fall into Columbus Circle, Stegron and his fellow dinosaurs eat her. Some days later, Stegron joins the re-assembled Avengers, whose headquarters he assists in repairing. He is present when Dino-Thor swears Spider-Man in as the new Baron of Spider-Island.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gage, Christos]] (w), [[Medina, Paco]] (a). "Part Five: The Grand Finale", ''Spider-Island'' #5 (2015). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
Stegron appears in ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''. He is seen in Spec-Ops #21 where he is on the [[High Evolutionary]]'s side at the time when he was in a power struggle against [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] in the Savage Land.

Stegron appears in issue 6 of "Super Hero Squad" (based on ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]''). He is featured as an archaeologist who is turned into Stegron by an Infinity Fractal.&lt;ref&gt;''Super Hero Squad'' #6. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[biology]]-based interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach ([[holism]] instead of the more traditional [[reductionist|reductionism]]) to biological research.&lt;ref name="Tavassoly 487–500"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tavassoly|first=Iman|last2=Goldfarb|first2=Joseph|last3=Iyengar|first3=Ravi|date=2018-10-04|title=Systems biology primer: the basic methods and approaches|url=http://essays.biochemistry.org/content/early/2018/10/02/EBC20180003|journal=Essays in Biochemistry|volume=62|issue=4|language=en|pages=487–500|doi=10.1042/EBC20180003|issn=0071-1365|pmid=30287586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly from year 2000 onwards, the concept has been used widely in biology in a variety of contexts. The [[Human Genome Project]] is an example of applied [[systems thinking]] in biology which has led to new, collaborative ways of working on problems in the biological field of genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zewail|first1=Ahmed|title=Physical Biology: From Atoms to Medicine|date=2008|publisher=Imperial College Press|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aims of systems biology is to model and discover [[emergent property|emergent properties]], properties of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s and [[organism]]s functioning as a [[system]] whose theoretical description is only possible using techniques of systems biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Perspectives on Organisms - Springer|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35938-5|series = Lecture Notes in Morphogenesis|year = 2014|isbn = 978-3-642-35937-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tavassoly 487–500"/&gt; These typically involve [[metabolic networks]] or [[cell signaling]] networks.&lt;ref name="pmid21570668"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bu Z, Callaway DJ |title=Proteins MOVE!

== Overview ==
Systems biology can be considered from a number of different aspects:

* As a field of study, particularly, the study of the interactions between the components of biological systems, and how these interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system (for example, the [[enzymes]] and [[metabolites]] in a [[metabolic pathway]] or the heart beats).&lt;ref name="snoep05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="21stcentury" /&gt;&lt;ref name="noble06" /&gt;
* As a [[paradigm]], usually defined in antithesis to the so-called [[reductionist]] paradigm ([[biological organisation]]), although fully consistent with the [[scientific method]]. The distinction between the two paradigms is referred to in these quotations:

:"The [[Reductionism|reductionist]] approach has successfully identified most of the components and many of the interactions but, unfortunately, offers no convincing concepts or methods to understand how system properties emerge&amp;nbsp;... the pluralism of causes and effects in biological networks is better addressed by observing, through quantitative measures, multiple components simultaneously and by rigorous data integration with mathematical models." (Sauer ''et al.'')&lt;ref name="sauer07" /&gt;

:"Systems biology&amp;nbsp;... is about putting together rather than taking apart, integration rather than reduction. It requires that we develop ways of thinking about integration that are as rigorous as our reductionist programmes, but different.&amp;nbsp;... It means changing our philosophy, in the full sense of the term." ([[Denis Noble]])&lt;ref name="noble06" /&gt;

*As a series of operational [[protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]]s used for performing research, namely a cycle composed of theory, [[Mathematical model|analytic]] or [[computational model]]ling to propose specific testable hypotheses about a biological system, experimental validation, and then using the newly acquired quantitative description of cells or cell processes to refine the computational model or theory.&lt;ref name="kholodenko05" /&gt; Since the objective is a model of the interactions in a system, the experimental techniques that most suit systems biology are those that are system-wide and attempt to be as complete as possible. Therefore, [[transcriptomics]], [[metabolomics]], [[proteomics]] and [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput techniques]] are used to collect quantitative data for the construction and validation of models.&lt;ref name=Romualdi09 /&gt;
* As the application of [[dynamical systems theory]] to [[molecular biology]]. Indeed, the focus on the dynamics of the studied systems is the main conceptual difference between systems biology and [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref name=Voit01&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voit|first1=Eberhard|title=A First Course in Systems Biology|date=2012|publisher=Garland Science|isbn=9780815344674}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a [[Socio-scientific issues|socioscientific]] phenomenon defined by the strategy of pursuing integration of complex data about the interactions in biological systems from diverse experimental sources using interdisciplinary tools and personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

This variety of viewpoints is illustrative of the fact that systems biology refers to a cluster of peripherally overlapping concepts rather than a single well-delineated field. However, the term has widespread currency and popularity as of 2007, with chairs and institutes of systems biology proliferating worldwide.

== History ==
Systems biology finds its roots in:{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
* the quantitative modeling of [[enzyme kinetics]], a discipline that flourished between 1900 and 1970,
* the mathematical modeling of [[population dynamics]],
* the simulations developed to study [[neurophysiology]],
* [[control theory]] and [[cybernetics]],
* [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetics]].

One of the theorists who can be seen as one of the precursors of systems biology is [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] with his [[general systems theory]].&lt;ref name="vonBertalanffy68" /&gt; One of the first numerical simulations in [[cell biology]] was published in 1952 by the British neurophysiologists and Nobel prize winners [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Fielding Huxley]], who constructed a mathematical model that explained the [[action potential]] propagating along the [[axon]] of a [[neuron]]al cell.&lt;ref name="hodgkin52" /&gt; Their model described a cellular function emerging from the interaction between two different molecular components, a [[Potassium channel|potassium]] and a [[sodium channel]], and can therefore be seen as the beginning of computational systems biology.&lt;ref name="lenovere07" /&gt;  Also in 1952, Alan Turing published [[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]], describing how non-uniformity could arise in an initially homogeneous biological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Turing | first1 = A. M. | authorlink = Alan Turing| title = The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 237 | issue = 641 | pages = 37–72 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | url = http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf| jstor = 92463| year = 1952 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1952RSPTB.237...37T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, [[Denis Noble]] developed the first computer model of the [[heart pacemaker]].&lt;ref name="noble60" /&gt;

The formal study of systems biology, as a distinct discipline, was launched by systems theorist [[Mihajlo Mesarovic]] in 1966 with an international symposium at the [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Institute of Technology]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], titled "Systems Theory and Biology".&lt;ref name="mesarovic68" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science68" /&gt;

The 1960s and 1970s saw the development of several approaches to study complex molecular systems, such as the [[metabolic control analysis]] and the [[biochemical systems theory]]. The successes of [[molecular biology]] throughout the 1980s, coupled with a skepticism toward [[theoretical biology]], that then promised more than it achieved, caused the quantitative modeling of biological processes to become a somewhat minor field.&lt;ref name="hunter12" /&gt;

However, the birth of [[functional genomics]] in the 1990s meant that large quantities of high-quality data became available, while the computing power exploded, making more realistic models possible. In 1992, then 1994, serial articles &lt;ref&gt;B.&amp;nbsp;J. Zeng, "On the holographic model of human body", 1st National Conference of Comparative
Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine and West Medicine, Medicine and Philosophy, April 1992 ("systems medicine and pharmacology" termed).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeng (B.) J., On the concept of system biological engineering, Communication on Transgenic Animals, No. 6, June, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.&amp;nbsp;J. Zeng, "Transgenic animal expression system – transgenic egg plan (goldegg plan)",
''Communication on Transgenic Animal'', Vol.1, No.11, 1994 (on the concept of system genetics and term coined).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.&amp;nbsp;J. Zeng, "From positive to synthetic science", ''Communication on Transgenic Animals'', No. 11, 1995 (on systems medicine).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.&amp;nbsp;J. Zeng, "The structure theory of self-organization systems", ''Communication on Transgenic Animals'',
No.8-10, 1996. Etc.&lt;/ref&gt; on systems medicine, systems genetics, and systems biological engineering by B.&amp;nbsp;J. Zeng was published in China and was giving a lecture on biosystems theory and systems-approach research at the First International Conference on Transgenic Animals, Beijing, 1996. In 1997, the group of [[Masaru Tomita]] published the first quantitative model of the metabolism of a whole (hypothetical) cell.&lt;ref name="tomita97" /&gt;

Around the year 2000, after Institutes of Systems Biology were established in [[Seattle]] and [[Tokyo]], systems biology emerged as a movement in its own right, spurred on by the completion of various [[genome projects]], the large increase in data from the [[omics]] (e.g., [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]]) and the accompanying advances in high-throughput experiments and [[bioinformatics]]. Shortly afterwards, the first departments wholly devoted to systems biology were founded (for example, the Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HMS launches new department to study systems biology | url = https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2003/09/hms-launches-new-department-to-study-systems-biology/ | publisher = Harvard Gazette | date = September 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In 2003, work at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] was begun on CytoSolve, a method to model the whole cell by dynamically integrating multiple molecular pathway models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=3032229 | pmid=21423324 | doi=10.1007/s12195-010-0143-x | volume=4 | issue=1 | title=CytoSolve: A Scalable Computational Method for Dynamic Integration of Multiple Molecular Pathway Models | date=March 2011 | journal=Cell Mol Bioeng | pages=28–45 | last1 = Ayyadurai | first1 = VA | last2 = Dewey | first2 = CF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, various research institutes dedicated to systems biology have been developed. For example, the [[NIGMS]] of [[NIH]] established a project grant that is currently supporting over ten systems biology centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Systems Biology - National Institute of General Medical Sciences | url = http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/SysBio/ | publisher =  | accessdate = 12 December 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019100123/http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/SysBio/ | archivedate = 19 October 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of summer 2006, due to a shortage of people in systems biology&lt;ref name="careers" /&gt; several doctoral training programs in systems biology have been established in many parts of the world. In that same year, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) put forward a grand challenge for systems biology in the 21st century to build a mathematical model of the whole cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gilbert S. |last=Omenn |date=December 2006 |title=Grand Challenges and Great Opportunities in Science, Technology, and Public Policy |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=314 |issue=5806 |pages=1696–1704 |doi=10.1126/science.1135003 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5806/1696.full }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the first whole-cell model of Mycoplasma Genitalium was achieved by the Karr Laboratory at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. The whole-cell model is able to predict viability of M. Genitalium cells in response to genetic mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karr|first1=Jonathan R.|last2=Sanghvi|first2=Jayodita C.|last3=Macklin|first3=Derek N.|last4=Gutschow|first4=Miriam V.|last5=Jacobs|first5=Jared M.|last6=Bolival|first6=Benjamin|last7=Assad-Garcia|first7=Nacyra|last8=Glass|first8=John I.|last9=Covert|first9=Markus W.|title=A Whole-Cell Computational Model Predicts Phenotype from Genotype|journal=Cell|date=July 2012|volume=150|issue=2|pages=389–401|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.044|pmid=22817898|pmc=3413483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important milestone in the development of systems biology has become the international project [[Physiome]].

According to the interpretation of Systems Biology as the ability to obtain, integrate and analyze complex data sets from multiple experimental sources using interdisciplinary tools, some typical technology platforms are:
* [[Phenomics]]
: Organismal variation in [[phenotype]] as it changes during its life span.
* [[Genomics]]
: Organismal [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) sequence, including intra-organisamal cell specific variation. (i.e., [[telomere]] length variation)
* [[Epigenomics]] / [[Epigenetics]]
: Organismal and corresponding cell specific transcriptomic regulating factors not empirically coded in the genomic sequence. (i.e., [[DNA methylation]], [[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]], etc.).
* [[Transcriptomics]]
: Organismal, tissue or whole cell [[gene expression]] measurements by [[DNA microarray]]s or [[serial analysis of gene expression]]
* [[Interferomics]]
: Organismal, tissue, or cell-level transcript correcting factors (i.e., [[RNA interference]])
* [[Proteomics]]
: Organismal, tissue, or cell level measurements of proteins and peptides via [[two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]], [[mass spectrometry]] or multi-dimensional protein identification techniques (advanced [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] systems coupled with [[mass spectrometry]]). Sub disciplines include [[phosphoproteomics]], [[glycoproteomics]] and other methods to detect chemically modified proteins.
* [[Metabolomics]]
: Organismal, tissue, or cell-level measurements of small molecules known as [[metabolites]]
* [[Glycomics]]
: Organismal, tissue, or cell-level measurements of [[carbohydrate]]s

: Organismal, tissue, or cell level measurements of [[lipids]].
In addition to the identification and quantification of the above given molecules further techniques analyze the dynamics and interactions within a cell. This includes:{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
* [[Interactomics]]
: Organismal, tissue, or cell level study of interactions between molecules. Currently, the authoritative molecular discipline in this field of study is [[protein-protein interaction]]s (PPI), although the working definition does not preclude inclusion of other molecular disciplines such as those defined here.

[[Cancer systems biology]] is an example of the systems biology approach, which can be distinguished by the specific object of study ([[tumorigenesis]] and [[Cancer treatment|treatment of cancer]]). It works with the specific data  (patient samples, high-throughput data with particular attention to characterizing [[Cancer genome sequencing|cancer genome]] in patient tumour samples) and tools (immortalized cancer [[cell lines]], [[Animal testing on rodents|mouse models]] of tumorigenesis, [[xenograft]] models, [[high-throughput sequencing]] methods, siRNA-based gene knocking down [[high-throughput screening]]s, computational modeling of the consequences of somatic [[mutations]] and [[genome instability]]).&lt;ref name="barillot13"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barillot | first1 =Emmanuel  | last2 = Calzone | first2 = Laurence | last3 = Hupe | first3 = Philippe | last4 = Vert | first4 =

Significant efforts in computational systems biology of cancer have been made in creating realistic multi-scale ''[[in silico]]'' models of various tumours.&lt;ref name="byrne2010"&gt;

The investigations are frequently combined with large-scale perturbation methods, including gene-based ([[RNAi]], mis-expression of [[wild type]] and mutant genes) and chemical approaches using small molecule libraries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[Robot]]s and automated sensors enable such large-scale experimentation and data acquisition. These technologies are still emerging and many face problems that the larger the quantity of data produced, the lower the quality.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A wide variety of quantitative scientists ([[computational biology|computational biologists]], [[statistician]]s, [[mathematician]]s, [[computer scientist]]s and [[physicist]]s) are working to improve the quality of these approaches and to create, refine, and retest the models to accurately reflect observations.

The systems biology approach often involves the development of [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanistic]] models, such as the reconstruction of [[dynamic system]]s from the quantitative properties of their elementary building blocks.&lt;ref name="dibernardo03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dibernardo05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dynamicmodel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korkut|first1=A|last2=Wang|first2=W|last3=Demir|first3=E|last4=Aksoy|first4=BA|last5=Jing|first5=X|last6=Molinelli|first6=EJ|last7=Babur|first7=Ö|last8=Bemis|first8=DL|last9=Onur Sumer|first9=S|last10=Solit|first10=DB|last11=Pratilas|first11=CA|last12=Sander|first12=C|title=Perturbation biology nominates upstream-downstream drug combinations in RAF inhibitor resistant melanoma cells.|journal=eLife|date=18 August 2015|volume=4|pmid=26284497|doi=10.7554/eLife.04640|pmc=4539601}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a cellular network can be modelled mathematically using methods coming from [[chemical kinetics]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Ankur|last2=Rawlings|first2=James B.|date=2014-4|title=Comparison of Parameter Estimation Methods in Stochastic Chemical Kinetic Models: Examples in Systems Biology|journal=AIChE Journal|volume=60|issue=4|pages=1253–1268|doi=10.1002/aic.14409|issn=0001-1541|pmc=4946376|pmid=27429455}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[control theory]].

Other aspects of computer science, [[informatics]], and statistics are also used in systems biology. These include:
* New forms of computational models, such as the use of [[process calculi]] to model biological processes (notable approaches include stochastic [[π-calculus]], BioAmbients, Beta Binders, BioPEPA, and Brane calculus) and [[constraint programming|constraint]]-based modeling.
* Integration of information from the literature, using techniques of [[information extraction]] and [[text mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ananadou | first1 = Sophia | author1-link = Sophia Ananiadou | last2 = Kell | first2 = Douglas | last3 = Tsujii | first3 = Jun-ichi | title = Text mining and its potential applications in systems biology | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 24 | issue = 12 | pages = 571–579 | date = December 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.10.002 | pmid = 17045684 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Systems theory''' is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of [[system]]s. A system is a cohesive conglomeration of interrelated and interdependent parts that is either [[natural]] or [[man-made]]. Every system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose or nature and expressed in its functioning. In terms of its effects, a system can be more than the sum of its parts if it expresses [[synergy]] or [[emergent behavior]]. Changing one part of the system usually affects other parts and the whole system, with predictable patterns of behavior. For systems that are self-learning and self-adapting, the positive growth and adaptation depend upon how well the system is adjusted with its environment. Some systems function mainly to support other systems by aiding in the maintenance of the other system to prevent failure. The goal of systems theory is systematically discovering a system's dynamics, [[Theory of constraints|constraints]], conditions and elucidating principles (purpose, measure, methods, tools, etc.) that can be discerned and applied to systems at every level of nesting, and in every field for achieving optimized [[equifinality]].&lt;ref&gt;Beven, K. (2006). A manifesto for the equifinality thesis. Journal of hydrology, 320(1), 18-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

General systems theory is about broadly applicable concepts and principles, as opposed to concepts and principles applicable to one domain of knowledge. It distinguishes dynamic or active systems from static or passive systems. Active systems are activity structures or components that interact in behaviours and processes. Passive systems are structures and components that are being processed. E.g. a program is passive when it is a disc file and active when it runs in memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paolo Rocchi|title=Technology + Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2X17MLCjsKgC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2000|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-1-58603-035-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is related to '''systems thinking''' and [[systems engineering]].

== Key concepts ==
* System: An organized entity made up of interrelated and interdependent parts.
* Boundaries: Barriers that define a system and distinguish it from other systems in the environment.
* Homeostasis: The tendency of a system to be resilient towards external factors and maintain its key characteristics.
* Adaptation: The tendency of a self-adapting system to make the internal changes needed to protect itself and keep fulfilling its purpose.
* Reciprocal Transactions: Circular or cyclical interactions that systems engage in such that they influence one another.
* Feedback Loop: The process by which systems self-correct based on reactions from other systems in the environment.
* Throughput: Rate of energy transfer between the system and its environment during the time it is functioning.
* Microsystem: The system closest to the client.
* Mesosystem: Relationships among the systems in an environment.
* Exosystem: A relationship between two systems that has an indirect effect on a third system.
* Macrosystem: A larger system that influences clients, such as policies, administration of entitlement programs, and culture.
* Chronosystem: A system composed of significant life events that can affect adaptation.

== Origin of the term ==
The term "general systems theory" originates from [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Bertalanffy]]'s [[#General systems research and systems inquiry|general systems theory]] (GST). His ideas were adopted by others including [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], [[William Ross Ashby]] and [[Anatol Rapoport]] working in mathematics, psychology, biology, game theory and [[social network analysis]].

Sociological systems thinking started earlier, in the 19th century.  Stichweh states:&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Badie et al. (eds.), ''International Encyclopedia of Political Science''. Sage New York.&lt;/ref&gt; "... Since its beginnings the [[social science]]s were an important part of the establishment of systems theory... the two most influential suggestions were the comprehensive sociological versions of systems theory which were proposed by [[Talcott Parsons]] since the 1950s and by [[Niklas Luhmann]] since the 1970s." References include Parsons' [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Stichweh (2011) "[http://www.fiw.uni-bonn.de/demokratieforschung/personen/stichweh/pdfs/80_stw_systems-theory-international-encyclopedia-of-political-science_2.pdf Systems Theory]", in:y.&lt;/ref&gt; and Luhmann's social systems theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luhmann|first=Niklas|title=Soziale Systeme: Grundriß einer allgemeinen Theorie|date=1984|publisher=Suhrkamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Contemporary ideas from systems theory have grown with diverse areas, exemplified by the work of biologist [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], linguist [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]], ecological systems with [[Howard T. Odum]], [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Fritjof Capra]], [[organizational theory]] and [[management]] with individuals such as [[Peter Senge]], interdisciplinary study with areas like [[Human Resource Development]] from the work of [[Richard A. Swanson]], and insights from educators such as [[Debora Hammond]] and Alfonso Montuori. As a transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary and [[Multiperspectivalism|multiperspectival]] domain, the area brings together principles and concepts from [[ontology]], [[philosophy of science]], [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[biology]] and [[engineering]] as well as [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[psychotherapy]] (within [[family systems therapy]]) and [[economics]] among others. Systems theory thus serves as a bridge for interdisciplinary dialogue between autonomous areas of study as well as within the area of [[systems science]] itself.

In this respect, with the possibility of misinterpretations, von Bertalanffy&lt;ref&gt;Bertalanffy (1950: 142)&lt;/ref&gt; believed a general theory of systems "should be an important regulative device in science", to guard against superficial analogies that "are useless in science and harmful in their practical consequences". Others remain closer to the direct systems concepts developed by the original theorists. For example, [[Prigogine|Ilya Prigogine]], of [[the Center for Complex Quantum Systems]] at the University of Texas, Austin, has studied [[emergence|emergent properties]], suggesting that they offer [[analogy|analogues]] for [[life|living systems]]. The theories of [[autopoiesis]] of [[Francisco Varela]] and [[Humberto Maturana]] represent further developments in this field. Important names in contemporary systems science include [[Russell Ackoff]], [[Ruzena Bajcsy]], [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Anthony Stafford Beer]], [[Peter Checkland]], [[Barbara Grosz]], [[Brian Wilson (systems scientist)|Brian Wilson]], [[Robert L. Flood]], [[Allenna Leonard]], [[Radhika Nagpal]], [[Fritjof Capra]], [[Warren McCulloch]], [[Kathleen Carley]], [[Michael C. Jackson]], [[Katia Sycara]], and [[Edgar Morin]] among others.

With the modern foundations for a general theory of systems following World War I, [[Ervin Laszlo]], in the preface for Bertalanffy's book: ''Perspectives on General System Theory'', points out that the [[translation]] of "general system theory" from German into English has "wrought a certain amount of havoc":&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"&gt;(Laszlo 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It (General System Theory) was criticized as pseudoscience and said to be nothing more than an admonishment to attend to things in a holistic way. Such criticisms would have lost their point had it been recognized that von Bertalanffy's general system theory is a perspective or paradigm, and that such basic conceptual frameworks play a key role in the development of exact scientific theory. .. Allgemeine Systemtheorie is not directly consistent with an interpretation often put on 'general system theory,' to wit, that it is a (scientific) "theory of general systems." To criticize it as such is to shoot at straw men. Von Bertalanffy opened up something much broader and of much greater significance than a single theory (which, as we now know, can always be falsified and has usually an ephemeral existence): he created a new paradigm for the development of theories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isss.org/laszlofw.htm Forward by Ervin Laszlo] to Perspectives on GENERAL SYSTEM THEORY by Ludwig von Bertalanffy&lt;/ref&gt;}} "Theorie" (or "Lehre"), just as "Wissenschaft" (translated Scholarship), "has a much broader meaning in German than the closest English words 'theory' and 'science'".&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"/&gt; These ideas refer to an organized body of knowledge and "any systematically presented set of concepts, whether [[empirically]], [[axiomatically]], or [[philosophical]]ly" represented, while many associate "Lehre" with theory and science in the etymology of general systems, though it also does not translate from the German very well; its "closest equivalent" translates as "teaching", but "sounds dogmatic and off the mark".&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"/&gt;  While the idea of a "general systems theory" might have lost many of its root meanings in the translation, by defining a new way of thinking about science and [[Paradigm|scientific paradigms]], Systems theory became a widespread term used for instance to describe the interdependence of relationships created in [[organization]]s.

A system in this frame of reference can contain regularly interacting or interrelating groups of activities. For example, in noting the influence in organizational psychology as the field evolved from "an individually oriented [[industrial psychology]] to a systems and developmentally oriented [[organizational psychology]]", some theorists recognize that organizations have complex social systems; separating the parts from the whole reduces the overall effectiveness of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;(Schein 1980: 4-11)&lt;/ref&gt; This difference, from conventional models that center on individuals, structures, departments and units, separates in part from the whole, instead of recognizing the interdependence between groups of individuals, structures and processes that enable an organization to function. Laszlo&lt;ref&gt;Laslo (1972: 14-15)&lt;/ref&gt; explains that the new systems view of organized complexity went "one step beyond the Newtonian view of organized simplicity" which reduced the parts from the whole, or understood the whole without relation to the parts. The relationship between organisations and their [[environment (systems)|environments]] can be seen as the foremost source of complexity and interdependence. In most cases, the whole has properties that cannot be known from analysis of the constituent elements in isolation. [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], who argued—along with the founders of the systems society—that "the benefit of humankind" is the purpose of science, has made significant and far-reaching contributions to the area of systems theory. For the Primer Group at ISSS, Bánáthy defines a perspective that iterates this view:&lt;ref&gt;(Banathy 1997: ¶ 22)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2016}}

{{quote|The systems view is a world-view that is based on the discipline of SYSTEM INQUIRY. Central to systems inquiry is the concept of SYSTEM. In the most general sense, system means a configuration of parts connected and joined together by a web of relationships. The Primer Group defines system as a family of relationships among the members acting as a whole. Von Bertalanffy defined system as "elements in standing relationship."}}

Similar ideas are found in learning theories that developed from the same fundamental concepts, emphasising how understanding results from knowing concepts both in part and as a whole. In fact, Bertalanffy's organismic psychology paralleled the learning theory of [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref name="GST"&gt;1968, General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications, New York: George Braziller, revised edition 1976: {{ISBN|0-8076-0453-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider interdisciplinary perspectives critical in breaking away from [[industrial age]] models and thinking, wherein history represents history and math represents math, while the arts and sciences [[Academic specialization|specialization]] remain separate and many treat teaching as [[behaviorist]] conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;(see Steiss 1967; Buckley, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary work of [[Peter Senge]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Senge (2000: 27-49)&lt;/ref&gt; provides detailed discussion of the commonplace critique of educational systems grounded in conventional assumptions about learning, including the problems with fragmented knowledge and lack of holistic learning from the "machine-age thinking" that became a "model of school separated from daily life". In this way some systems theorists attempt to provide alternatives to, and evolved ideation from orthodox theories which have grounds in classical assumptions, including individuals such as [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] in sociology and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] in [[scientific management]].&lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994: 3-8; see also Owens 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The theorists sought holistic methods by developing systems concepts that could integrate with different areas.

Some may view the contradiction of [[reductionism]] in conventional theory (which has as its subject a single part) as simply an example of changing assumptions. The emphasis with systems theory shifts from parts to the organization of parts, recognizing interactions of the parts as not static and constant but dynamic processes. Some questioned the conventional [[closed system]]s with the development of [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] perspectives. The shift originated from [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] and universal authoritative principles and knowledge to relative and general [[concept]]ual and [[perceptual]] knowledge&lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994: 3-8)&lt;/ref&gt; and still remains in the tradition of theorists that sought to provide means to organize human life. In other words, theorists rethought the preceding [[history of ideas]]; they did not lose them. Mechanistic thinking was particularly critiqued, especially the industrial-age mechanistic [[metaphor]] for the mind from [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]]s of [[Newtonian mechanics]] by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers and later psychologists that laid the foundations of modern organizational theory and management by the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994; Flood 1997; Checkland 1999; Laszlo 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of applications==

===System dynamics===
{{Main|System dynamics}}
System dynamics is an approach to understanding the [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] behaviour of [[complex system]]s over time using [[Stock and flow|stocks, flows]], internal [[feedback loop]]s, and time delays.&lt;ref name="sysdyn"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/sysdyn/sd-intro/ MIT System Dynamics in Education Project (SDEP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems biology===
{{Main|Systems biology}}
Systems biology is a movement that draws on several trends in bioscience research. Proponents describe systems biology as a biology-based inter-disciplinary study field that focuses on complex interactions in [[biological system]]s, claiming that it uses a new perspective ([[holism]] instead of [[reductionist|reduction]]). Particularly from the year 2000 onwards, the [[biosciences]] use the term widely and in a variety of contexts. An often stated ambition of systems biology is the modelling and discovery of [[emergent property|emergent properties]] which represents properties of a system whose theoretical description requires the only possible useful techniques to fall under the remit of systems biology. It is thought that [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] may have created the term systems biology in 1928.&lt;ref name="LVB1928"&gt;1928, Kritische Theorie der Formbildung, Borntraeger. In English: Modern Theories of Development: An Introduction to Theoretical Biology, Oxford University Press, New York: Harper, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems ecology===
{{Main|Systems ecology}}
Systems ecology is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[ecology]], a subset of [[Earth system science]], that takes a [[holism|holistic]] approach to the study of ecological systems, especially [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Shugart, Herman H., and Robert V. O'Neill. "Systems Ecology". Dowden, Hutchingon &amp; Ross, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Dyne, George M. "Ecosystems, Systems Ecology, and Systems Ecologists". ORNL- 3975.

Central to the systems ecology approach is the idea that an ecosystem is a [[complex system]] exhibiting [[emergent properties]]. Systems ecology focuses on interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems, and is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions. It uses and extends concepts from [[thermodynamics]] and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems.

===Systems engineering===
{{Main|Systems engineering}}
[[Systems engineering]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] approach and means for enabling the realisation and deployment of successful [[system]]s. It can be viewed as the application of engineering techniques to the engineering of systems, as well as the application of a systems approach to engineering efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomé | first = Bernhard | authorlink = | date = 1993 | title = Systems Engineering: Principles and Practice of Computer-based Systems Engineering | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester| isbn = 0-471-93552-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems engineering integrates other disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and disposal. Systems engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers, with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=INCOSE|author-link=INCOSE |url=http://www.incose.org/practice/whatissystemseng.aspx|title=What is Systems Engineering|accessdate=2006-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Blockley David, Godfrey Patrick ''Doing it Differently: Systems for Rethinking Infrastructure (2nd Edition)'' ICE Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-0-7277-6082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems psychology===
{{Main|Systems psychology}}
Systems psychology is a branch of [[psychology]] that studies [[human behaviour]] and [[experience]] in [[complex system]]s. It received inspiration from systems theory and systems thinking, as well as the basics of theoretical work from [[Roger Barker]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Humberto Maturana]] and others. It makes an approach in [[psychology]] in which groups and individuals receive consideration as [[systems]] in [[homeostasis]]. Systems psychology "includes the domain of [[engineering psychology]], but in addition seems more concerned with societal systems and with the study of motivational, affective, cognitive and group behavior that holds the name engineering psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Lester R. Bittel and Muriel Albers Bittel (1978), ''Encyclopedia of Professional Management'', McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-005478-9}}, p.498.&lt;/ref&gt; In systems psychology, "characteristics of [[organizational behaviour]], for example individual needs, rewards, [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s, and attributes of the people interacting with the [[systems]], considers this process in order to create an effective system".&lt;ref&gt;Michael M.

Whether considering the first systems of written communication with [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[cuneiform]] to [[Maya numerals|Mayan numerals]], or the feats of engineering with the [[Egyptian pyramids]], systems thinking can date back to antiquity. Differentiated from Western [[rationalist]] traditions of philosophy, C. West Churchman often identified with the [[I Ching]] as a systems approach sharing a frame of reference similar to [[pre-Socratic]] philosophy and [[Heraclitus]].&lt;ref&gt;(Hammond 2003: 12-13)&lt;/ref&gt; Von Bertalanffy traced systems concepts to the philosophy of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|G.W. Leibniz]] and [[Nicholas of Cusa]]'s ''[[Coincidentia oppositorum#Coincidentia oppositorum|coincidentia oppositorum]]''. While modern systems can seem considerably more complicated, today's systems may embed themselves in history.

Figures like [[James Prescott Joule|James Joule]] and [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] represent an important step to introduce the ''systems approach'' into the (rationalist) [[Hard Science|hard sciences]] of the 19th century, also known as the [[energy transformation]]. Then, the [[thermodynamics]] of this century, by [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Josiah Gibbs]] and others, established the ''system'' [[reference model]] as a formal scientific object.

The [[Society for General Systems Research]] specifically catalyzed systems theory as an area of study, which developed following the World Wars from the work of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Anatol Rapoport]], [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], [[William Ross Ashby]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[C. West Churchman]] and others in the 1950s, had specifically catalyzed by collaboration in. Cognizant of advances in science that questioned classical assumptions in the organizational sciences, Bertalanffy's idea to develop a theory of systems began as early as the interwar period, publishing "An Outline for General Systems Theory" in the ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'', Vol 1, No. 2, by 1950. Where assumptions in Western science from Greek thought with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' have historically influenced all areas from the hard to social sciences (see [[David Easton]]'s seminal development of the "[[political system]]" as an analytical construct), the original theorists explored the implications of twentieth century advances in terms of systems.

People have studied subjects like [[complexity]], [[self-organization]], [[connectionism]] and [[adaptive systems]] in the 1940s and 1950s. In fields like cybernetics, researchers such as [[Norbert Wiener]], [[William Ross Ashby]], [[John von Neumann]] and [[Heinz von Foerster]], examined complex systems mathematically. [[John von Neumann]] discovered [[cellular automata]] and self-reproducing systems, again with only pencil and paper. [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] and [[Jules Henri Poincaré]] worked on the foundations of [[chaos theory]] without any [[computer]] at all. At the same time [[Howard T. Odum]], known as a radiation ecologist, recognized that the study of general systems required a language that could depict [[energetics]], [[thermodynamics]] and [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] at any system scale. Odum developed a general system, or [[universal language]], based on the circuit language of [[electronics]], to fulfill this role, known as the [[Energy Systems Language]]. Between 1929-1951, [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] at the [[University of Chicago]] had undertaken efforts to encourage innovation and interdisciplinary research in the social sciences, aided by the [[Ford Foundation]] with the interdisciplinary Division of the Social Sciences established in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond 2003: 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scholars had actively engaged in these ideas before ([[Tectology]] by [[Alexander Bogdanov]], published in 1912-1917, is a remarkable example), but in 1937, von Bertalanffy presented the general theory of systems at a conference at the University of Chicago.

The systems view was based on several fundamental ideas. First, all phenomena can be viewed as a web of relationships among elements, or a [[system]]. Second, all systems, whether [[electrical]], [[biological]], or [[social system|social]], have common [[patterns]], [[behaviors]], and [[properties]] that the observer can analyze and use to develop greater insight into the behavior of complex phenomena and to move closer toward a unity of the sciences. System philosophy, methodology and application are complementary to this science.&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"/&gt; By 1956, theorists established the [[Society for General Systems Research]], which they renamed the International Society for Systems Science in 1988. The Cold War affected the research project for systems theory in ways that sorely disappointed many of the seminal theorists. Some began to recognize that theories defined in association with systems theory had deviated from the initial General Systems Theory (GST) view.&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Kenneth Boulding]], an early researcher in systems theory, had concerns over the manipulation of systems concepts. Boulding concluded from the effects of the Cold War that abuses of [[Political power|power]] always prove consequential and that systems theory might address such issues.&lt;ref&gt;(Hammond 2003: 229-233)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the Cold War, a renewed interest in systems theory emerged, combined with efforts to strengthen an [[ethical]]&lt;ref&gt;1968 Ludwig von Bertalanffy publishes General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications&lt;/ref&gt; view on the subject.

==Developments==

===General systems research and systems inquiry===
Many early systems theorists aimed at finding a general systems theory that could explain all systems in all fields of science. The term goes back to [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Bertalanffy]]'s book titled "''General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications''" from 1968.&lt;ref name="GST"/&gt; He developed the "allgemeine Systemlehre" (general systems theory) first via lectures beginning in 1937 and then via publications beginning in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]: ''... aber vom Menschen wissen wir nichts'', (English title: Robots, Men and Minds), translated by Dr. Hans-Joachim Flechtner. page 115. Econ Verlag GmbH (1970), Düsseldorf, Wien. 1st edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Bertalanffy's objective was to bring together under one heading the organismic science he had observed in his work as a biologist. His desire was to use the word ''system'' for those principles that are common to systems in general. In GST, he writes:

{{quote|...there exist models, principles, and laws that apply to generalized systems or their subclasses, irrespective of their particular kind, the nature of their component elements, and the relationships or "forces" between them. It seems legitimate to ask for a theory, not of systems of a more or less special kind, but of universal principles applying to systems in general.|Von Bertalanffy&lt;ref&gt;(GST p.32)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ervin Laszlo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.isss.org/perspectives_on_general_system_theory|title=start [ProjectsISSS]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the preface of von Bertalanffy's book ''Perspectives on General System Theory'':&lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy, Ludwig, (1974) ''Perspectives on General System Theory'' Edited by Edgar Taschdjian. George Braziller, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus when von Bertalanffy spoke of Allgemeine Systemtheorie it was consistent with his view that he was proposing a new perspective, a new way of doing science. It was not directly consistent with an interpretation often put on "general system theory", to wit, that it is a (scientific) "theory of general systems." To criticize it as such is to shoot at straw men. Von Bertalanffy opened up something much broader and of much greater significance than a single theory (which, as we now know, can always be falsified and has usually an ephemeral existence): he created a new paradigm for the development of theories.}}

Ludwig von Bertalanffy outlines systems inquiry into three major domains: Philosophy, Science, and Technology. In his work with the Primer Group, Béla H. Bánáthy generalized the domains into four integratable domains of systemic inquiry:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Domain
!Description
|-
|Philosophy
|the [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and [[axiology]] of systems
|-
|Theory
|a set of interrelated concepts and principles applying to all systems
|-
|Methodology
|the set of models, strategies, methods and tools that instrumentalize systems theory and philosophy
|-
|Application
|the application and interaction of the domains
|}

These operate in a recursive relationship, he explained. Integrating Philosophy and Theory as Knowledge, and Method and Application as action, Systems Inquiry then is knowledgeable action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.isss.org/Main/SystemsInquiry|title=start [ProjectsISSS]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cybernetics===
{{Main|Cybernetics}}

Cybernetics is the study of the [[communication]] and control of regulatory [[feedback]] both in living and lifeless systems (organisms, organizations, machines), and in combinations of those. Its focus is how anything (digital, mechanical or biological) controls its behavior, processes information, reacts to information, and changes or can be changed to better accomplish those three primary tasks.

The terms "systems theory" and "cybernetics" have been widely used as synonyms. Some authors use the term ''cybernetic'' systems to denote a proper subset of the class of general systems, namely those systems that include [[feedback]] loops. However [[Gordon Pask]]'s differences of eternal interacting actor loops (that produce finite products) makes general systems a proper subset of cybernetics. According to Jackson (2000), von Bertalanffy promoted an embryonic form of general system theory (GST) as early as the 1920s and 1930s but it was not until the early 1950s it became more widely known in scientific circles.

Threads of cybernetics began in the late 1800s that led toward the publishing of seminal works (e.g., Wiener's ''Cybernetics'' in 1948 and von Bertalanffy's ''General Systems Theory'' in 1968). Cybernetics arose more from engineering fields and GST from biology. If anything it appears that although the two probably mutually influenced each other, cybernetics had the greater influence. Von Bertalanffy (1969) specifically makes the point of distinguishing between the areas in noting the influence of cybernetics: "Systems theory is frequently identified with cybernetics and control theory. This again is incorrect. Cybernetics as the theory of control mechanisms in technology and nature is founded on the concepts of information and feedback, but as part of a general theory of systems;" then reiterates: "the model is of wide application but should not be identified with 'systems theory' in general", and that "warning is necessary against its incautious expansion to fields for which its concepts are not made." (17-23). Jackson (2000) also claims von Bertalanffy was informed by [[Alexander Bogdanov]]'s three volume ''[[Tectology]]'' that was published in Russia between 1912 and 1917, and was translated into German in 1928. He also states it is clear to Gorelik (1975) that the "conceptual part" of general system theory (GST) had first been put in place by Bogdanov. The similar position is held by [[Richard Mattessich|Mattessich]] (1978) and Capra (1996). Ludwig von Bertalanffy never even mentioned Bogdanov in his works, which Capra (1996) finds "surprising".

Cybernetics, [[catastrophe theory]], [[chaos theory]] and [[Complex systems#Complexity and chaos theory|complexity theory]] have the common goal to explain complex systems that consist of a large number of mutually interacting and interrelated parts in terms of those interactions. Cellular automata (CA), neural networks (NN), artificial intelligence (AI), and [[artificial life]] (ALife) are related fields, but they do not try to describe general (universal) complex (singular) systems. The best context to compare the different "C"-Theories about complex systems is historical, which emphasizes different tools and methodologies, from pure mathematics in the beginning to pure computer science now. Since the beginning of chaos theory when [[Edward Lorenz]] accidentally discovered a [[strange attractor]] with his computer, computers have become an indispensable source of information. One could not imagine the study of complex systems without the use of computers today.

===Complex adaptive systems===
{{Main|Complex adaptive system}}
Complex adaptive systems (CAS) are special cases of [[complex system]]s. They are ''complex'' in that they are diverse and composed of multiple, interconnected elements; they are ''adaptive'' in that they have the capacity to change and learn from experience. In contrast to control systems in which [[negative feedback]] dampens and reverses disequilibria, CAS are often subject to [[positive feedback]], which magnifies and perpetuates changes, converting local irregularities into global features. Another mechanism, [[Dual-phase evolution]] arises when connections between elements repeatedly change, shifting the system between phases of variation and selection that reshape the system. Differently from Beer [[Management cybernetics|Management Cybernetics]], [[Cultural Agency Theory]] (CAT) provides a modelling approach to explore predefined contexts and can be adapted to reflect those contexts.

The term ''complex adaptive system'' was coined at the interdisciplinary [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI), by [[John Henry Holland|John H. Holland]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and others. An alternative conception of complex adaptive (and learning) systems, methodologically at the interface between natural and social science, has been presented by [[Kristo Ivanov]] in terms of [[Kristo Ivanov#Hypersystems|hypersystems]]. This concept intends to offer a theoretical basis for understanding and implementing participation of "users", decisions makers, designers and affected actors, in the development or maintenance of self-learning systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristo Ivanov|Ivanov, K.]] (1993). Hypersystems: A base for specification of computer-supported self-learning social systems. In C. M. Reigeluth, B. H. Banathy, &amp; J. R. Olson (Ed.),'' Comprehensive systems design: A new educational technology'' (pp. 381-407). New York: Springer-Verlag. (NATO ASI Series F: Computer and Systems Sciences, Vol 95.)

'''''The Politics of Nonviolent Action''''' is a three-volume political science book by [[Gene Sharp]], originally published in the United States in 1973. Sharp is one of the most influential theoreticians of [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent action]], and his publications have been influential in struggles around the world. This book contains his foundational analyses of the nature of political power, and of the methods and dynamics of nonviolent action. It represents a "thorough revision and rewriting"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|vi}} of the author's 1968 doctoral thesis at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;Gene Sharp (1968), "The politics of nonviolent action: a study in the control of political power." Doctoral dissertation at [[University of Oxford]]. {{OCLC|46341106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been reviewed in professional journals&lt;ref

The three volumes or "parts" of ''The Politics of Nonviolent Action'' contain a total of 14 chapters, as well as a preface by the author, and an introduction by [[Thomas C. Schelling]]. Each part begins with an introduction by the author.&lt;ref name=tocexplain&gt;Other book information: the same detailed table of contents is published in each volume. Bibliographic notes are placed at the end of each chapter. All three volumes are served by a single 53-page index at the end of volume 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume or "part" addresses the theory of power that implicitly or explicitly underlies [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent action]]; Volume 2 offers a detailed analysis of the ''methods'' of nonviolent action; and the Volume 3 analyzes the ''dynamics'' of nonviolent action.

===Part One: Power and Struggle===
Chapter 1, ''The Nature and Control of Political Power'', explains that, 
although rarely articulated, there are "basically... two views of the nature of power."&lt;ref name=v1ref&gt;Vol. 1 of ''Politics of Nonviolent Action'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} The "monolith theory"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|9}} views people as dependent upon the good will of their governments, whereas [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent action]] is grounded in the converse "pluralistic-dependency theory"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|9}} that views government as "dependent on the people's good will, decisions and support,"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|8}} a view that Sharp argues is "sounder and more accurate."&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|8}} Sharp argues that "political power is not intrinsic to the power-holder,"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|11}} but flows from outside sources that include perceptions of authority, available human resources; skills and knowledge; material resources; and intangible psychological and ideological factors. These sources all depend upon obedience, which arises for "various and multiple"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|19}} reasons that include habit, fear of sanctions, perceived moral obligation, psychological identification with the ruler, zones of indifference, and absence of self-confidence among subjects. Obedience is essentially voluntary, and consent can be withdrawn.

Next, ''Nonviolent Action: An Active Technique of Struggle'' (chapter 2) explains that nonviolent action may be used for a diverse mixture of motives that are religious, ethical, moral, or based on expediency.&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|67}} "Passivity, submission, cowardice [have] nothing to do with the nonviolent technique,"&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|65}} which is correctly understood as "''one'' type of ''active'' response."&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|65}}&lt;ref name=emph&gt;Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonviolence has suffered scholarly neglect.&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|71–4}} Nonviolence may involve both ''acts of omission'' and ''acts of commission'',&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|68}} does not rely solely on persuading the opponent,&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|70}} and "does not depend on the assumption that man is inherently 'good'."&lt;ref name=v1ref/&gt;{{rp|70}} These and other characteristics of nonviolence are explained and illustrates through examples from ancient Rome, colonial United States, Tsarist Russia, Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Latin America, India, Czeschoslavakia, and the Southern United States.

===Part Two: The Methods of Nonviolent Action===

Volume 2 (chapters 3 to 8) contains a detailed listing and description of specific methods of nonviolent action, such as [[boycott]]s, [[Strike action|strikes]], and [[sit-in]]s. Such a listing, Sharp says, "may assist actionists in the selection of methods most appropriate for use in a particular situation... [or] give researchers and persons evaluating the political potentialities of the nonviolent technique a greater grasp of its armory of methods of struggle."&lt;ref name=v2ref&gt;Vol. 2 of ''Politics of Nonviolent Action'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}} Nearly 200 methods are listed in the table of contents, and Sharp groups them into three broad categories, ''protest and persuasion'' (ch. 3), ''noncooperation'' (chs. 4-7), and ''intervention'' (ch. 8), in terms of how they relate to the dynamics of nonviolent action (Vol. 3). These categories "ought not to be regarded as rigid, but simply as generally valid."&lt;ref name=v2ref/&gt;{{rp|114}} The methods are summarized in the adjacent table.

===Part Three: The Dynamics of Nonviolent Action===
The third volume focuses on the dynamics of nonviolent action, which always "involves continuous change in the various influences and forces which operate in that process and are constantly influencing each other. No discussion in static terms... can be valid."&lt;ref name=v3ref&gt;Vol. 3 of Politics of Nonviolent Action (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|450}} It opens with Chapter 9, ''Laying the Groundwork for Nonviolent Action'', with subsections addressing such issues as casting off fear, the social sources of power changes, leadership needs, openness and secrecy, investigation, negotiations, generating "cause-consciousness."&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|473}} It also describes key elements of nonviolent strategy and tactics, pertaining to issues such as initiative, timing, numbers and strength, psychological elements, application of an [[Indirect approach]], the choice of weapons (as described in Vol. 2), and the issuance of an [[ultimatum]].

Chapter 10 describes how the onset of nonviolent action is likely to bring various types of oppression, and reviews examples and approaches for withstanding increasing repression, which is imperative, because "without willingness to face repression... the nonviolent action movement cannot hope to succeed."&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|547}} Chapter 11 describes methods for maintaining the nonviolent group's solidarity, such as "Maintaining rapport"&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|575}} through regular mass meetings. Chapter 11 also extensively analyzes the threats against and needs for ongoing adherence to nonviolent discipline, "in order to bring into operation the changes that will alter relationships and achieve [the] objectives,"&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|573}} even as "the opponent... tries to provoke them to commit violence - with which he could deal more effectively."&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|573}}

Chapter 12 covers "political ''[[jujutsu|jiu-jitsu]]''... one of the special processes by which nonviolent action deals with violent repression."&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|657}} More specifically:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By combining nonviolent discipline with solidarity and persistence in struggle, the nonviolent actionists cause the violence of the opponent's repression to be exposed in the worst possible light. This, in turn, may lead to shifts in opinion and then to shifts in power relationships favorable to the nonviolent group. These shifts result from withdrawal of support for the opponent and the grant of support to the nonviolent actionists.&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|657}} 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This chapter provides numerous historical examples of such political ''jiu-jitsu'', and analyzes such factors as the impact of third party opinion and international indignation, arousing dissent and opposition in the opponent's own camp, and increasing support and participation from the grievance group.

''Three Ways Success May Be Achieved'' (Chapter 13) describes and analyzes ''conversion'', ''accommodation'', and ''nonviolent coercion''. These represent "three broad processes, or mechanisms, by which the complicated forces utilized and produced by nonviolent action influence the opponent and his capacity for action and thereby perhaps bring success to the cause of the grievance group":&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|705–6}} 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ''conversion'' the opponent has been inwardly changed so that he wants to make the changes desired by the nonviolent actionists. In ''accommodation'', the opponent does not agree with the changes... and he could continue the struggle... but... has concluded that it is best to grant some or all of the demands.... In ''nonviolent coercion'' the opponent has not changed his mind on the issues and wants to ''continue'' the struggle, but is ''unable'' to do so; the sources of his power and means of control have been taken away from him without the use of violence . This may have been done by the nonviolent group or by the opposition and noncooperation among his own group (as, [[mutiny]] of his troops), or some combination of these.&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|706}}  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Finally, ''The Redistribution of Power'' (Chapter 14) describes how using the nonviolent technique is likely to affect the nonviolent group, and the distribution of power between the contenders and in the larger society or system. Such effects may include the ending of submissiveness, increases in hope, effects on [[aggression]], [[masculinity]], [[crime]] and [[violence]], increased group unity, and the decentralization of power. "Nonviolent action appears by its very nature to contribute to the diffusion of effective power throughout the society"&lt;ref name=v3ref/&gt;{{rp|802}} due in part to the enhanced self-reliance of those using the technique.

In ''[[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]'', [[Kenneth E. Boulding|Kenneth Boulding]] described the book as "monumental,"&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|140}} writing that "there are some works which bear the unmistakable stamp of the classic.... and this work is a good candidate."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|140}} Sharp, he said, "has been called the "[[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] of nonviolence" and the "[[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] of nonviolent warfare" [and] the comparisons are by no means unjust."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|140}} The book "reveals a large but previously mostly unnoticed segment of human action relationship which would very properly be described as 'nonviolent warfare.'"&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|140–1}} Boulding asserted several parallels with a seminal work in his own field, economics, explaining that
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
this volume... reminds one of &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Adam Smith]]'s&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''. There is a single theme of immense importance to society played in innumerable variations throughout the whole work. There is a wealth of historical illustration and detail. There is a distinct view of society as a whole seen perhaps from a somewhat unfamiliar angle. And there is a wholly honorable passion for human betterment through intellectual clarification.&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|140}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Boulding stated that if a key word for economics is "exchange," then the key word for nonviolent action is "[[Civil disobedience|disobedience]]" - "One might almost call Gene Sharp's book, therefore... the discovery of disobedience, especially of large-scale disobedience.... nonviolent action is concerned with the institutionalization of a threat-defiance system."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|141}} A key to this process, Boulding argues, is the "dynamics of [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]... [the] public denial of the legitimacy of some command,"&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|141}} which Sharp "hints at many times," although Sharp "never quite works [it] out in detail."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|141}}
Boulding described Part II as "in some ways... the meatiest and richest part of the work,"&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|142}} although he noted that Sharp's examples are drawn from "quite restricted range"&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|142}} of human history:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There must be many examples from Chinese history; Latin America is hardly mentioned; and the European middle ages, with its extraordinary phenomenon of the "[[Peace and Truce of God|Truce of God]]," receives hardly a mention. Nevertheless, Sharp's examples are broad and wide and illustrate the universality and significance of this phenomenon, which, simply because it has not had a name, has been grossly neglected by conventional historians.&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|142}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Boulding also reported some ways that Sharp's theoretical analysis seemed to be deficient, "even in terms of what might be called 'classical' or [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhian]] theories of nonviolence."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|142}} The book's analysis
&lt;blockquote&gt;
neglects the importance of "[[Satyagraha]]" or "Truth-grasping," that is, the appeal of nonviolent action to some objective truth, even an objective moral truth, as the basic source of its legitimacy. In this sense nonviolent action is closer to the spirit of science than it is to the spirit of war, in that it is concerned... that truth should prevail no matter who wins. Sharp, perhaps in too great a reaction to the accusations of sentimental [[pacifism]] sometimes brought against nonviolence, has stressed the conflictual aspects of it perhaps to the exclusion of its integrative aspects."&lt;ref name=boulding74/&gt;{{rp|142–3}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[International Organization]]'', Bleicher's 21-page review stated that "What Professor Sharp... has demonstrated is that our understanding of the dependency of governments upon the
continuing [[consent of the governed]] can be translated into the development of nonviolent action as a strategy of change that is effective outside of established institutional arrangements and yet operates without the use of force."&lt;ref name=bleicher75/&gt;{{rp|532}} He wrote that Sharp 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
has exposed the inadequacy of assuming the monolithic character of the nation state in [[international relations]] theory. Recognition of nonviolent action as a tool in the hands of governments and citizens to influence the policies of other nations and of international organizations calls for a fundamental re-evaluation of the critical parameters in the study and conduct of international relations.&lt;ref name=bleicher75/&gt;{{rp|532}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bleicher stated that the "full utilization of this new understanding requires an expansion of the horizons of scholars and policy makers in the international arena, the collection and application of new data in the evaluation of international relations, and the development of new theoretical constructs."&lt;ref name=bleicher75/&gt;{{rp|532}} He warned that if we do not develop a better understanding of phenomenon related to nonviolence, we face the danger that we will be progressively less able to... design policies and institutions that can cope with the future."&lt;ref name=bleicher75/&gt;{{rp|532}}

In ''[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]]'', [[Carl Joachim Friedrich|Carl J. Friedrich]] wrote that Sharp considers his view of power as "much more original than it is,"&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|465}} and that the reviewer [Friedrich] found it "exasperating to try and follow arguments with the drift of which he definitely sympathized, except for their alleged novelty."&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|467}} In particular, Sharp does not
&lt;blockquote&gt;
relate [his view of power] to such classics as [[Charles Merriam]]'s magisterial treatment of power, or even [[Bertrand Russell]]'s journalistic book on the subject. He seems unaware of the reviewer's [Friedrich's] analysis of many years ago, in which the distinction between two views of power, and the dependence of power on the cooperation of those over whom it is wielded, was analytically developed, and its root in the classics was shown.&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|465}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Friedrich also stated that a "fundamental weakness"&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|465}} of Sharp's argument was his understanding of violence "as physical violence,"&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|465}} since "some of the most vicious forms of coercion are psychic."&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|465–6}} Furthermore "According to Sharp, violence by definition excludes demolition and destruction of things, such as machinery, buildings and the like. Hence, according to him, much sabotage is not violent; clearly at this point Sharp deviates markedly from popular usage."&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|466}} Due to the "illusory"&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|466}} nature of the distinction based on physical violence alone, Sharp is often "confused,"&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|466}} although "many thoughtful arguments are offered."&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|466–7}} Friedrich concluded that "the topic of how to avoid violence in political conflicts is an important one, the treatment given here is learned, but not very clear, and the results not conclusive," but that the book was a "timely one" that he hoped it will "lead to further more searching studies."&lt;ref name=friedrich74/&gt;{{rp|467}}

In ''The Western Political Quarterly'', [[Harold L. Nieburg|H. L. Nieburg]] wrote that he "would like to see the work cut down to 125 pages and published in paperback as a token of new life for insurgency politics. But, this... should not deter one from the duty to welcome a monumental, competent, and sometimes exciting, work of scholarship."&lt;ref name=nieburg74/&gt;{{rp|338}}

In ''[[NASW Press Journals#Social Work|Social Work]]'', Harry Specht stated that "Sharp has performed a useful service for students of [[community organizing]] by producing an encyclopedic description of nonviolent action," and that "by shear weight of detail, the reader comes to recognize that nonviolent action has been far more pervasive than many assume."&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|249}} Specht stated that the books flaws included "repetition and excessive detail,"&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|249}} and that the book "seems to imply that nonviolent action is usually undertaken by the oppressed against the state and that it is usually in the cause of positive social change. But... for example, I have just read of two massive nonviolent demonstrations in Boston, one for and the other against integration of the public schools."&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|249}} Specht described an "absence of a clear theoretical framework.... it does not illuminate such central questions as... Why is nonviolent action used in some cases and not in others? Why does it work in some cases and not in others?"&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|249–50}} The book is also "rich with writings on social movements and thin on theorists such as [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Amitai Etzioni]], [[Jerome Skolnick]], and [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] - who have dealt with conflict and violence."&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|249}}  Still, "Sharp's work is an impressive accomplishment that will be welcomed as an important addition to the literature of community organizing."&lt;ref name=specht75/&gt;{{rp|250}}

The article described Sharp's "eureka moment" of insight when he was at Oxford, explaining that "That moment would evolve into Sharp's first big text, 'The Politics of Non-Violence [sic],' which was published in 1973.

After re-reading both the English and the Spanish texts, I was amazed at the quality of the condensation made by Mr. Gonzalez Bernal. This concentrated version... provides the essence of the nonviolent technique. I decided that this English text must be published" (pp. xi-xiii).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Calvinism}}{{Protestantism}}
'''Tullio Vinay''' is a [[Waldensian]] [[pastor]] and [[theologian]], as well as an [[Italy|Italian]]  politician, who was born in [[The Spezia]] on May 13, 1909 and died in [[Rome]] on September 2, 1996. Recognized as a [[Righteous Among the Nations]] and founder of two important church institutions, he is one of the leading figures of [[Protestantism in Italy|Italian Protestantism]] in the 20th century.

== Biography ==
=== Youth and training ===
Tullio Vinay is the son of a teacher, pastor and theologian of the [[Waldensian Evangelical Church]]. He grew up in [[Trieste]] and [[Torre Pellice]] and studied Protestant theology in [[Rome]] at the Waldensian Faculty of Theology and then at [[Edinburgh University]].

=== Start of Career and Second World War ===
From his consecration in 1934 until 1946, he was pastor of the Evangelical Waldensian Church of [[Florence]]. During this period, he launched into multiple anti-fascist activities and managed to save dozens of Jews who hid in a secret apartment within the headquarters of the Waldensian church Via Manzoni.&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4018080 Site of [[Yad Vashem]], article on Tullio Vinay].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, he was recognized [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by the Israeli government, which did not prevent him from being sharply critical of  the [[State of Israel]]'s policies towards [[Palestinians]].

[[File: Agape 5.JPG |thumb|left| View of the Agapè center (in the foreground, the bell tower).]]

=== Foundation of the International Agapè Center ===
In 1946, Tullio Vinay left his pastoral position in Florence, and the following year he founded the [[Ecumenism|Ecumenical]] Church Center at [[Prali]], in [[Piedmont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://agapecentroecumenico.org/en/|title=Agapè, Ecumenical Center |publisher=the official website of the Agape Center|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This name is taken from the [[Koine Greek|biblical Greek]] word ἀγάπη (agapè) which means divine love or unconditional fraternal love.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, after the [[World War II]], the Waldensian Church wanted to contribute actively to the necessary work of reconciliation. In 1947, under the leadership of Pastor Tullio Vinay, some young Italian Protestants began the construction project of the Agapè Center. With the support of the [[World Council of Churches]], they were soon joined by young people from different countries who, just a few years before, were fighting each other in a merciless war: Americans, English, Germans, French, etc. Agapè was a place of meeting, living and working together for young people from different countries but also different religions, including non-believers, in a confrontation where everyone would have to give up their claim of owning the truth, a concept well ahead of its time in 1947.&lt;ref name = Storia&gt;{{cite web|language=it|url=http://www.milanovaldese.it/chi-siamo/storiarecente.php|date=|publisher=the site of the Milan Waldensian Church| title=the recent nostra storia - Chiesa Valdese Milano|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this center was thus summarized by its founder: "Agape is a place where people meet and spend a brief period of living together in search of brotherly love. To the question of when the idea of founding this center was born, Tullio Vinay replied: "When we discovered, with astonishment and surprise, that God loves us". The architect of the building was Leonardo Ricci, a renowned architect and also a friend of Tullio Vinay.

=== Settlement in Sicily ===
In 1961, Pastor Vinay gave life to a new great project, this time in the heart of [[Sicily]], in the city of [[Riesi]], where he founded the "Christian service center"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=it|url=http://www.serviziocristiano.org/ |title=Servizio Cristiano di Riesi (Riesi Christian service)| publisher = serviziocristiano.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to respond to the economic, social and moral misery of the local population and to create an outpost against the [[Mafia]]'s excessive power. Without practicing any form of [[proselytism]], the Riesi Christian Service immediately identified its areas of intervention, education, health and sustainable development of the territory, in accordance with the Protestant and Waldensian vision which believes that each person must be accompanied towards their liberation of any form of slavery, including when it is a cultural one.&lt;ref name = Storia /&gt; Today, the Christian service of Riesi consists of a kindergarten, an elementary school, an accommodation centre, a social and health center (initially a family counseling center) and an agricultural advisory center. Originally, there was also a vocational school. Since 2009, it is recognized as being of cultural interest by the region of [[Sicily]].

As for Agape, the building of the Christian Service Center was designed and built between 1963 and 1966 by architect Leonardo Ricci; named ''Monte degli Ulivi '' ([[Mount of Olives]]), the building is considered to be a remarkable example of the 20th century Italian architecture.

=== Political commitment ===
From 1976 to 1983, Tullio Vinay was a member of the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate of the Italian Republic]], elected as independent on the [[Italian Communist Party]]'s list.

== Posterity ==
Pastor Tullio Vinay is the outstanding figure of Italian Protestantism in the 20th century. He has considerably renewed its Christian proclamation and testimony of charity through the founding of the two institutions of Agape and Riesi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr| url = https://www.museeprotestant.org/notice/histoire-des-vaudois/|title=Histoire des Vaudois | publisher = le Musée virtuel du protestantisme (the Virtual Protestant Museum| accessdate= 2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 Tullio Vinay was the inspiration of the two founders of the ''Mouvement des Chrétiens pour l'Abolition de la Torture'' (Christian Action for the Abolition of Torture movement, a.k.a.

==Overview==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recently published a new estimate on abortions in the world (2017). The new estimates reveal that in the time period of 2010-14 there were 55.7 million abortions worldwide each year. Out of these abortions, approximately 54% were safe, 31% were less safe, and 14% were least safe. That means that 25 million (45%) abortions each year between 2010 and 2014 were unsafe, with 24 million (97%) of these in developing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganatra|first=Bela|last2=Gerdts|first2=Caitlin|last3=Rossier|first3=Clémentine|last4=Johnson|first4=Brooke Ronald|last5=Tunçalp|first5=Özge|last6=Assifi|first6=Anisa|last7=Sedgh|first7=Gilda|last8=Singh|first8=Susheela|last9=Bankole|first9=Akinrinola|date=2017-11-25|title=Global, regional, and subregional classification of abortions by safety, 2010–14: estimates from a Bayesian hierarchical model|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31794-4/fulltext|journal=The Lancet|language=English|volume=390|issue=10110|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31794-4|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

They also concluded abortion is safer in countries where it's legal, but dangerous in countries where it's outlawed and performed clandestinely. The WHO reports that in developed regions, nearly all abortions (92%) are safe, whereas in developing countries, more than half (55%) are unsafe.  According to WHO statistics, the risk rate for unsafe abortion is 1/270; according to other sources, unsafe abortion is responsible for at least 8% of maternal deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nour NM |title=An Introduction to Maternal Mortality |journal=Reviews in Ob Gyn |year=2008 |volume=1 |pages=77–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Worldwide, 48% of all induced abortions are unsafe.

An article pre-printed by the World Health Organization called safe, legal abortion a "[[fundamental right]] of women, irrespective of where they live" and unsafe abortion a "silent [[pandemic]]".&lt;ref name="Pandemic"/&gt; The article states "ending the silent pandemic of unsafe abortion is an urgent [[public health|public-health]] and [[human-rights]] imperative." It also states "access to safe abortion improves [[women’s health]], and vice versa, as documented in [[Romania]] during the regime of President [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]" and "legalisation of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women’s health" citing that in some countries, such as India where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers. WHO’s Global Strategy on Reproductive Health, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2004, noted: "As a preventable cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, unsafe abortion must be dealt with as part of the MDG on improving maternal health and other international development goals and targets."&lt;ref name="who2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/hrpwork/en/index.html |publisher=WHO |title=Preventing unsafe abortion |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), whose research concerns people's sexual and reproductive health and lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/ |title=New findings from the WHO Multicountry Survey on Maternal and Newborn Health |publisher=WHO |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an overall strategy to combat unsafe abortion that comprises four interrelated activities:&lt;ref name="who2" /&gt;
*to collate, synthesize and generate scientifically sound evidence on unsafe abortion prevalence and practices;
*to develop improved technologies and implement interventions to make abortion safer;
*to translate evidence into norms, tools and guidelines;
*and to assist in the development of programmes and policies that reduce unsafe abortion and improve access to safe abortion and highquality postabortion care

A 2007 study published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' found that, although the global rate of abortion declined from 45.6 million in 1995 to 41.6 million in 2003, unsafe procedures still accounted for 48% of all abortions performed in 2003. It also concluded that, while the overall incidence of abortion in both developed and developing countries is approximately equal, unsafe abortion occurs more often in less-developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

According to a new study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' that focused on data from 2010 to 2014, nearly 55 million pregnancies are terminated early and of that 55 million, nearly half, 25.5 million are deemed as unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, A. (2017, September 27). Report finds nearly half of all abortions worldwide are unsafe. Retrieved December 05, 2017, from https://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-finds-nearly-half-of-all-abortions-worldwide-are-unsafe/&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization and the Guttmacher Institute in New York, stresses the need for access to a safe abortion for all women and that unsafe methods must be replaced. Africa, Asia and Latin America account for almost 97 percent of them of unsafe abortions. These regions are often poorer and underdeveloped and lack the access to safe abortion methods. Out of all abortions in these regions only 25% are considered safe. In developed countries these numbers improve drastically. Nearly all abortions in North America (99%) are considered safe. Overall nearly 88% of abortions in developed countries were actually considered safe, with the number of safe abortions in Europe slightly lower.

==Conflating illegal and unsafe abortion==
Unsafe abortions often occur [[abortion law|where abortion is illegal]].&lt;ref name="Rosenthal2007"/&gt; However, the prevalence of unsafe abortion may also be determined by other factors, such as whether it occurs in a [[developing country]] that has a low level of competent medical care.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, S.K.  ''[https://books.google.com/?id=pzanxKlcU74C&amp;pg=PA259 Practice Of Fertility Control: A Comprehensive Manual]'', 7th Edition, page 259 (Elsevier India, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsafe abortions sometimes occur where abortion is legal, and safe abortions sometimes occur where abortion is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Faúndes, Aníbal and Barzelatto, José.  ''[https://books.google.com/?id=U89BF625xcwC&amp;pg=PA21 The Human Drama of Abortion: a Global Search for Consensus]'', page 21 (Vanderbilt University Press 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Legalization is not always followed by elimination of unsafe abortion.&lt;ref name=Blas&gt;Blas, Erik et al.  ''[https://books.google.com/?id=7JxutqCmctUC&amp;pg=PA183 Equity, social determinants and public health programmes]'', pages 182-183 (World Health Organization 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO-unsafe-2007 2"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | year = 2007 | accessdate = March 7, 2011 | format = PDF | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596121_eng.pdf |quote= In several countries, the legalization of abortion has not been followed by elimination of unsafe abortion.|title = Unsafe abortion: Global and regional estimates of the incidence of unsafe abortion and associated mortality in 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Affordable safe services may be unavailable despite legality, and conversely women may be able to afford medically competent services despite illegality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=9ZRendehUUQC&amp;pg=PA12 Safe Abortion: Technical and Policy Guidance for Health Systems], page 15 (World Health Organization 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

When abortion is illegal, that generally contributes to the prevalence of unsafe abortion, but it is not the only contributor.  In addition, a lack of access to safe and effective contraception contributes to unsafe abortion. It has been estimated that the incidence of unsafe abortion could be reduced by as much as 73% without any change in abortion laws if modern family planning and maternal health services were readily available globally.&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt;

Illegality of abortion contributes to [[maternal mortality]], but that contribution is not as great as it once was, due to medical advances including [[penicillin]] and the [[birth control pill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://factcheck.org/article336.html "Abortion Distortions: Senators from both sides make false claims about Roe v. Wade"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726044751/http://factcheck.org/article336.html |date=2011-07-26 }}, FactCheck.org (2005-08-22): "Sen. Boxer claimed that overturning Roe v. Wade would cost the lives of more than 5,000 pregnant women a year. That might have been true before the invention of penicillin and the birth control pill, but it's not true now. The best evidence indicates that the annual deaths from illegal abortions would number in the hundreds, not thousands."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion in the U.S. before 1973 (Roe v. Wade)===
In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled 7–2 that laws prohibiting an abortion violated a woman’s right to privacy. The landmark case, ''Roe v. Wade'', changed abortion in the United States. Prior to Roe v. Wade, early abortion laws really only prohibited the use of toxic chemicals that were used to cause a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="CNN_22 January 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/22/health/roe-wade-abortion-timeline/index.html|title=Before and after Roe v. Wade - CNN|first=By Jacque Wilson,|last=CNN|date=22 January 2013|website=CNN.com|access-date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821 Connecticut passed the first law that regulated abortion, by barring the use of toxic chemicals.&lt;ref name="CNN_22 January 2013"/&gt;

Prior to 1973 the authority to legalize abortion rested with the state governments. Up through the 1960s 44 states had laws that outlawed abortions regardless if the abortion threatened the well-being of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/22/charts-how-roe-v-wade-changed-abortion-rights/|title=CHARTS: How Roe v.

In the 1940s records show that more than 1,000 women died each year from abortions that were labeled as unsafe. Many of these abortions were self-induced. Unsafe abortion practices were such a concern in the United States that nearly every large hospital had some type of “septic abortion ward” that was responsible for dealing with the complications that accompanied an incomplete abortion. Incomplete abortions were the leading cause for OB-GYN services across the United States.&lt;ref name="thinkprogress.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/what-americans-have-forgotten-about-the-era-before-roe-v-wade-19687b9e9b16/|title=What Americans Have Forgotten About The Era Before Roe v.&amp;nbsp;Wade|website=ThinkProgress.org|access-date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, the National Opinion Research Center found that hundreds of women were attempting to self-abort with coat hangers, knitting needles and ballpoint pens, and by swallowing toxic chemicals like bleach and laundry detergent.&lt;ref name="thinkprogress.org"/&gt; However, the number of deaths declined significantly into the 1960s and 1970s. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in 1972, 130,000 women attempted self-induced abortions or obtained illegal abortions, resulting in 39 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/03/lessons-roe-will-past-be-prologue|title=Lessons from Before Roe: Will Past be Prologue?|date=22 September 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidents in the U.S. after 1973===
In 2005, the ''[[Detroit News]]'' reported that a 16-year-old boy beat his pregnant, under-age girlfriend with a bat at her request to abort a fetus. The young couple lived in Michigan, where [[Minors and abortion|parental consent]] is required to receive an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Methods==
Methods of unsafe abortion include:
* Trying to break the [[amniotic sac]] inside the [[womb]] with a sharp object or wire (for example an unbent wire [[clothes hanger]] or [[knitting needle]]). This method can cause infection or injury to internal organs (for example perforating the [[uterus]] or [[intestines]]), resulting in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soubiran|first=Andre|author-link=André Soubiran|title=Diary of a Woman in White|publisher=Avon Books|year=1969|edition=English|pages=98–99}} citing {{Cite book|title=Fatal Abortions|author=Henri Modnor|authorlink=Henri Mondor|year=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uterus softens during pregnancy and is very easy to pierce, so one traditional method was to use a large feather.&lt;ref name=avery-family&gt;{{cite book

* Pumping toxic mixtures, such as [[chili pepper]]s and chemicals like [[alum]], [[Lysol]], [[permanganate]], or [[herbicide|plant poison]] into the body of the woman. This method can cause the woman to go into [[toxic shock]] and die.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Saving Nigerians from risky abortions|author=Andrew Walker|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7328830.stm|date=7 April 2008|access-date=31 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inducing an abortion without medical supervision by self-administering [[abortifacient]] over-the-counter drugs or drugs obtained illegally or by using drugs not indicated for abortion but known to result in miscarriage or uterine contraction. Drugs that cause [[uterine contraction]]s include [[oxytocin]] (synthetic forms are [[Pitocin]] and [[Syntocinon]]), [[prostaglandin]]s, and [[ergot alkaloid]]s. Risks include [[uterine rupture]], [[irregular heartbeat]], a rise in blood pressure ([[hypertension]]), a drop in blood pressure ([[hypotension]]), [[anemia]] requiring [[blood transfusion|transfusion]], cardiovascular problems, [[pulmonary edema]], and death, as well as intense [[bronchospasm]]s in women with [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=uterine&gt;Rastegari E.C., Uretsky S.

==Health risks==
Unsafe abortion is a major cause of injury and death among women worldwide. It is estimated that nearly 25 million unsafe abortions take place annually.&lt;ref&gt;Ganatra B, Gerdts C, Rossier C, Johnson Jr B R, Tuncalp Ö, Assifi A, Sedgh G, Singh S, Bankole A, Popinchalk A, Bearak J, Kang Z, Alkema L.

An unsafe abortion can lead to wide range of health risks that can affect the well-being of women. The major and most life-threatening complications that stem from unsafe abortions are infection, hemorrhaging and injury to internal organs.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs388/en/|title=Preventing unsafe abortion|website=World Health Organization|access-date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abortion symptoms that can lead to additional health risks:
* To provide the necessary treatment, an accurate assessment of an unsafe abortion is critical. Some signs and symptoms that require immediate attention by a licensed health care provider include, but are not limited too: abdominal pain, vaginal infection, abnormal vaginal bleeding, shock (collapse of the circulatory system).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
* It is difficult to diagnose complications that result from an unsafe abortion. A woman with an extra-uterine or ectopic pregnancy may have symptoms similar to those of incomplete abortion. Therefore, it is important for health care providers to refer individuals they are unsure about to a facility where a definitive diagnosis can be made and care can be provided. &lt;ref&gt;Vlassoff et al. Economic impact of unsafe abortion-related morbidity and mortality: evidence and estimation challenges. Brighton, Institute of Development Studies, 2008 (IDS Research Reports 59).&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications and their treatments include:
* Infection: antibiotics prescribed by a health care provider and removing tissue from the affected area.
* Hemorrhage: swift treatment by a health care provider is imperative, as delays can be fatal.
Damage to the genital tract or internal organs: Admission to a health care facility is imperative, any delay can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;L Haddad. Unsafe Abortion: Unnecessary Maternal Mortality. Rev Obstet Gynecol. 2009 Spring; 2(2): 122–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment for abortion complications===
Regardless if an abortion was legal or illegal, health care providers are required by law to provide medical care to patients, as it may be life-saving. In some cases, treatment for abortion complications may be administered only when the woman provides information about the abortion and provides information about any and all persons that were involved.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Human Rights Committee; Committee Against Torture; Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to get a confession from a women seeking emergency medical care as a result of an illegal abortion because it puts women's lives at risk. However, it is a legal requirement for doctors  to report cases of women who have undergone any type of abortion. Any delay in care increases the risks to women’s health and lives. &lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==Illegal abortion==
{{Main article|Illegal abortion}}
An illegal abortion may be called a "back-alley", "backstreet", or "back-yard" abortion.

The wire [[Clothes hanger|coat hanger]] method was a popularly known illegal abortion procedure, although they were not the norm. Mary Calderone, former medical director of [[Planned Parenthood]], said, in a 1960 printing of the ''American Journal of Public Health'':
{{quote|Abortion is no longer a dangerous procedure. This applies not just to therapeutic abortions as performed in hospitals but also to so-called illegal abortions as done by physician. In 1957 there were only 260 deaths in the whole country attributed to abortions of any kind, second, and even more important, the conference [on abortion sponsored by Planned Parenthood] estimated that 90 percent of all illegal abortions are presently being done by physicians. Whatever trouble arises usually arises from [[self-induced abortion]]s, which comprise approximately 8 percent, or with the very small percentage that go to some kind of non-medical abortionist. Abortion, whether therapeutic or illegal, is in the main no longer dangerous, because it is being done well by physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=J. Douglas|title=Abortion, Medicine, and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPg35464NnAC&amp;pg=PT64|date=8 December 2011|publisher=Fideli Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-1-60414-445-1|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Herbalism|Herbal]] abortions (when done illegally) can also be described as an unsafe abortions because they are not induced in a medical facility.

The '''volcano rabbit''' (''Romerolagus diazi''), also known as '''teporingo''' or '''zacatuche''', is a small [[rabbit]] that resides in the mountains of [[Mexico]] &lt;ref&gt; Hoth, J., A. Velázquez F. Romero, L. León, M. Aranda and D. Bell, 1987. The Volcano Rabbit- a Shrinking Distribution and a Threatened Habitat. Oryx. IUCN. 21 (2): 85-91 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232022237_The_volcano_rabbit_-_A_shrinking_distribution_and_a_threatened_habitat &lt;/ref&gt;. It is the world's second-smallest rabbit, second only to the [[pygmy rabbit]]. It has small rounded ears, short legs, and short, thick fur and weighs approximately 390–600 g (0.86–1.3&amp;nbsp;lb). It has a life span of 7 to 9 years. The volcano rabbit lives in groups of 2 to 5 animals in burrows (underground nests) and runways among grass tussocks. The burrows can be as long as 5 m and as deep as 40&amp;nbsp;cm. There are usually 2 to 3 young per litter, born in the burrows. In semi-captivity, however, they don´t make burrows and the young are born in nests made in the grass tussocks &lt;ref&gt; Hoth, J. and H. Granados, 1987. A Preliminary Report on the Breeding of the Volcano Rabbit (Romerolagus diazi) at the Chapultepec Zoo, Mexico City.

Unlike many species of rabbits (and similar to [[pika]]s), the volcano rabbit emits very high-pitched sounds instead of thumping its feet on the ground to warn other rabbits of danger. It is [[crepuscular]] and is highly active during twilight, dawn and all times in between. Populations have been estimated to have approximately 150–200 colonies with a total population of 1,200 individuals over their entire range.&lt;ref name="Velazquez 1994 743"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Velazquez|first=Alejandro|title=Distribution and Population Size of ''Romerolagus diazi'' on El Pelado Volcano, Mexico|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|year= 1994|volume=75|issue=3|page=743|jstor=1382525|doi=10.2307/1382525}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last confirmed sighting of the species at Nevado de Toluca (were no permanent colony has been historically documented) occurred in August 2003 when just a single volcano rabbit was observed. Since 1987, research conducted by Hoth et al., in relation to the distribution of the Volcano Rabbit already found no records of this species in the Nevado de Toluca, including the site where Tikul Álvarez (IPN) collected a specimen in 1975 (Nevado de Toluca, 4 km S, 2 km W Raíces, 3350 masl). &lt;ref&gt; Hoth, J., A.

[[File:Taxidermied romerolagus diazi.JPG|thumb|right|A taxidermied volcano rabbit]]

Volcano rabbits are an [[endangered species]] endemic to Mexico.&lt;ref name=Velazquez&gt;{{cite journal|last=Velazquez|first=Alejandro|author2=Heil |title=Habitat Suitability Study for the Conservation of the Volcano Rabbit (''Romerolagus diazi'')|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|year=1996|volume=33|pages=543–554|doi=10.2307/2404983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the rabbit is native to four volcanoes just south and East of Mexico City, the largest of these volcanic regions is within the Izta-Popo National Park, other areas include the Chichinautzin and Pelado volcanos.&lt;ref&gt; Hoth, J., A.

&lt;ref name="Velazquez 1994 743"/&gt; The range of the volcano rabbit has been fragmented into 16 individual patches by human disturbance. Vegetation within these patches is dominated by native grasslands and include Nearctic and Neotropical varieties. Elevation of these patches is between 2900 and 3660 meters above sea level. &lt;ref name=Velazquez/&gt; The soil consists mostly of Andosol and Lithosol. The local climate is temperate, subhumid, and has a mean annual temperature of 11&amp;nbsp;°C. Annual rainfall averages at about 1000 millimeters. In the patches that are the most heavily populated with volcano rabbits, the plants ''Festuca tolucensus'' and ''Pinus hartwegii'' are most abundant.&lt;ref name=Velazquez/&gt; Volcano rabbits show strong preferences for habitat types that are categorized as open pine forests, open pine woodland, and mixed alder pine forest. Human activity in the area has had a great impact upon the preferred habitat of the volcano rabbit.&lt;ref name=Velazquez/&gt; Humans have fragmented the rabbits' habitat by constructing highways, farming, afforestation (i.e.. planting trees where they don´t belong), and lack of sound fire and grazing practices. Ecological fragmentation has been caused by environmental discontinuity.&lt;ref&gt; Hoth, J., A. Velázquez F. Romero, L. León, M. Aranda and D. Bell, 1987.

=== Habitat management ===
The IUCN/SSC Lagomorph Specialist Group has created an action plan for this rabbit that focuses upon the need to manage the burning and overgrazing of its Zacatón habitats and to enforce laws prohibiting its hunting, capture, and sale.&lt;ref name="Fa"/&gt; Studies about the volcano rabbit's geographical range, role in its habitat, population dynamics, and evolutionary history have been recommended.&lt;ref name="Fa"/&gt; In addition, habitat restoration and the establishment of Zacatón corridors to link core areas of habitat are needed.

== Diet ==
The volcano rabbit feeds primarily on grasses such as ''Festuca amplissima'', ''Muhlenbergia macroura'', ''Stipa ichu'', and ''Eryngium rosei''.&lt;ref name="Martinez"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.5154/r.rchscfa.2010.08.063| title = Composición de la dieta y capacidad nutricional de carga del hábitat del conejo de los volcanes (''Romerolagus diazi'') en México| journal = Revista Chapingo Serie Ciencias Forestales y del Ambiente| issue = 3| pages = 423–434| year = 2012| last1 = MartíNez-García | first1 = J.

A. | last5 = SáNchez-Torres-Esqueda | first5 = T. | last6 = RodríGuez-De Lara | first6 = R. | last7 = HernáNdez-García | first7 = P. A. | volume=XVIII}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rabbits also use these plants as cover to hide from predators. ''M. macroura'' was found to be in 89% of pellets of the volcano rabbits, suggesting that this is the base of their diet, but it does not actually provide the necessary energy and protein needs of the rabbits. Supplementing their diet with 15 other forms of plant life, volcano rabbits can get their required nutrition. Other plant species that also are responsible for supporting the volcano rabbit are the ''Muhlenbergia quadidentata'', the ''Pinus hartwegii'', ''F. tolucensis'', ''P. hartwegeii''.&lt;ref name="Martinez"/&gt; Volcano rabbits also consume leaves, foliage, and flowers indiscriminately under poor conditions, as habitat loss has eliminated much of their food sources.&lt;ref name="Martinez"/&gt; In fact, protein acquisition is the primary limiting factor on the size of the populations of each of the four volcanoes on which the species is located. Studies show that many individuals of the population suffer from serious weight loss and starvation.&lt;ref name="Martinez"/&gt;

Seasonal changes also affect the diet of the volcano rabbit greatly. The grasses it normally consumes are abundant during wet seasons. During the dry season, the volcano rabbit feasts on shrubs and small trees, as well as other woody plants. During the winter plants, these woody plants make up most of their diet, as well as the primary building material for their nests.&lt;ref name="Martinez"/&gt;

== Decline ==
Numerous studies conducted during the 1980s and 1990s agreed that the habitat of the volcano rabbit was shrinking due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic causes.&lt;ref name="Velazquez 1993 62–69"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Velazquez|first=A. |author2=Cervantes, F.A. |author3=Galindo-Leal, C. |title=The Volcano Rabbit ''Romerolagus diazi'', a Peculiar Lagomorph|journal=Lutra|year=1993|volume=36|pages=62–69|url=http://www.ciga.unam.mx/investigadores/zacatuche/PDF/611Articulos%20de%20investigacion%20en%20revistas%20arbitradas/6113Revistas%20Internacionales%20(incluidas%20en%20indices%20diferentes)/6113-3.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that its range has shrunk significantly during the last 18,000 years due to a 5–6&amp;nbsp;°C increase in the prevailing temperature, and its distribution is now divided into 16 patches.&lt;ref name="Velazquez 1993 62–69"/&gt; The fragmentation of the volcano rabbit's distribution has resulted from a long-term warming trend that has driven it to progressively higher altitudes and the relatively recent construction of highways that dissect its habitat.&lt;ref name="Velazquez 1993 62–69"/&gt;

Declines in the ''R. diazi'' population have been occurring due a number of changes in vegetation, climate, and, thus, elevation. The volcano rabbit is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change and other anthropogenic intrusions because of its extremely limited range and specialized diet.&lt;ref name="Velazquez 1993 62–69"/&gt; Patches of vegetation that ''R. diazi'' uses for survival are becoming fragmented, isolated and smaller, rendering the environment more open and therefore less suitable for its survival. Because the volcano rabbit inhabits the area surrounding Mexico City, Mexico's most populous region, it has suffered a very high rate of habitat destruction.&lt;ref name="Velazquez 1993 62–69"/&gt;

The cottontail rabbit, ''[[Sylvilagus]]'', is expanding into the volcano rabbit’s niche, but there is “no evidence that [volcano rabbits'] habitat selection is a response to competitive exclusion."  The volcano rabbit has been severely pressured by human intrusion into its habitat. Anthropogenic disturbance enables other rabbit species to flourish in grasslands, increasing competition with the volcano rabbit.&lt;ref name="Fa"/&gt;

Volcano rabbits have been bred in captivity &lt;ref&gt; Hoth, J. and H. Granados, 1987. A Preliminary Report on the Breeding of the Volcano Rabbit (Romerolagus diazi) at the Chapultepec Zoo, Mexico City. International Zoo Yearbook. 26:261-265. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229843031_A_preliminary_report_on_the_breeding_of_the_Volcano_rabbit_Romerolagus_diazi_at_the_Chapultepec_Zoo_Mexico_City &lt;/ref&gt;, but there is evidence that the species loses a significant amount of genetic diversity when it reproduces in such conditions. A comparative study done on wild and captive volcano rabbits found that the latter lost a substantial amount of DNA loci, and some specimens lost 88% of their genetic variability. There was, however, one locus whose variability was higher than that of the wild population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soto|first=Salomon|author2=Victor Manuel|author3=Contreras Montiel|author4=Jose Luis|author5=Matzumura|author6=Pablo Damian|author7=Vasquez Pelaez|author8=Carlos Gustavo|title=Assessment of the genetic variability in the captive population of Volcano Rabbit (''Romerolagus diazi'')|journal=Veterinaria Mexico|date=April–June 2005|volume=36|issue=2|pages=119–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats and conservation efforts ==
Threats to ''R. diazi'', or the volcano rabbit, include logging, harvesting of grasses, livestock grazing, habitat destruction, urban expansion, highway construction and too frequent forest fires. &lt;ref&gt; Hoth, J., A. Velázquez F. Romero, L. León, M. Aranda and D. Bell, 1987. The Volcano Rabbit- a Shrinking Distribution and a Threatened Habitat. Oryx. IUCN. 21 (2): 85-91 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232022237_The_volcano_rabbit_-_A_shrinking_distribution_and_a_threatened_habitat &lt;/ref&gt; More recent threats include unsound management policies of its habitat in National Parks and outside, mainly by afforestation (planting trees in grasslands where they do not belong).
&lt;ref&gt; Hoth, j. 2015. A ciegas entre reyes tuertos: comentarios a la conservación de suelo y ecosistemas templados en México.” Año Internacional del suelo. 5a Semana de la Diversidad Biológica de CONABIO http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhkCHtJOD5s&amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/ref&gt;
These threats have resulted in a loss of 15–20% of the volcano rabbit’s habitat during the last three generations. They have also resulted in ecological displacement and genetic isolation of ''R. diazi''. Hunting is another threat to the volcano rabbit, despite the fact that ''R. diazi'' is listed under Appendix 1 of [[CITES]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php "Interpretation."]  Appendices I, II and III of CITES. ''Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora''. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is illegal to hunt ''R. diazi'' under Mexican law. However, many are unaware that R. diazi is protected and officials do not adequately enforce its protection. Hunting, livestock grazing, and fires can even harm ''R. diazi'' within national parks that are protected such as Izta-Popo and Zoquiapan National Parks.
In terms of conservation efforts, various captive breeding programs have been established with relative success, but infant mortality in captivity is high.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt; Actions toward conservation should be focused on the enforcement of laws which forbid hunting and trading of the volcano rabbit. Furthermore, efforts must be put toward habitat management, specifically the control of forest fires and livestock overgrazing of grasses. Lastly, it would be beneficial to enact education programs regarding ''R. diazi'' and the various threats that face it. The public should also be educated about the volcano rabbit’s protected status, as many are unaware that it is illegal to hunt ''R. diazi''.

'''Voluntarism''', sometimes referred to as '''voluntary action''', is the principle that individuals are free to choose goals and how to achieve them within the bounds of certain societal and cultural constraints, as opposed to actions that are coerced or [[predetermined]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|chapter=Chapter Four: Talcott Parsons and Robert Merton, Functionalism and Modernization|title=Introduction to Sociological Theory: Theorists, Concepts, and their Applicability to the Twenty-First Century|last=Dillon|first=Michele|publisher=Wiley|orig-year=2009|year=2013|isbn=9781118471906|page=161, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volunteerism==
Volunteer management specialist Susan Ellis differentiates between "voluntarism" and "[[volunteerism]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Voluntarism" (the older term) refers to everything voluntary. In the United States this includes religion. It certainly encompasses the entire "[[voluntary sector]]," but "voluntary" in the "voluntarism" context means not mandated by law (as government is). Many voluntary sector (nonprofit) agencies have a volunteer board because that is a legal requirement, but may not utilize volunteers in direct service in any way. There are subjects within "voluntarism" that have nothing to do with volunteers, such as [[Unrelated Business Income Tax]] legislation, proposal writing, and compensation law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan J. Ellis |title=Volunt/ar/eer/ism: What's the Difference? |url=https://www.energizeinc.com/tips/voluntareerism-whats-difference |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030822/https://www.energizeinc.com/tips/voluntareerism-whats-difference |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Voluntary provision of services to religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history. Such volunteer efforts keep expenses down for non-profit and philanthropic organizations, empower individuals and groups to help others, and make volunteers feel needed.&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;{{cite web |author=Susan Perkins |url=http://www.learningtogive.org/papers/paper67.html |title=Voluntarism |publisher=Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism flourished in the 19th and early 20th centuries and was empowering especially to the women who had been excluded from political participation outside the home. Women’s organizations dealt with social problems created by rapid industrialization and urbanization, and by massive immigration which were not addressed by institutions of the time and had a great influence on American political culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kathryn Kish Sklar |url=http://www.puaf.umd.edu/IPPP/summer98/quckened_conscience.htm |date=1998 |title=The "Quickened Conscience"], |publisher=Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy, [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806053219/http://www.puaf.umd.edu/IPPP/summer98/quckened_conscience.htm |archivedate=August 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism is also used to describe non-coercive methods of recruiting soldiers, from participants in European and American military service to youthful combatants in civil war in Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lermuseum.org/ler/mh/wwii/voluntarism.html |title=Military History: Second World War: Homefront, 1940–45 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213221221/http://www.lermuseum.org/ler/mh/wwii/voluntarism.html |archivedate=December 13, 2007 |access-date=December 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}; {{cite book |author=John O'Sullivan |title=From Voluntarism to Conscription: Congress and Selective Service, 1940–1945 |year=1982}}; {{cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG265/images/webS0228.pdf |format=PDF |title=The End of Conscription in Europe? |author=Christopher Jehn |author2=Zachary Selden |publisher=National Security Division, Congressional Budget Office, United States Congress |date=2002 |accessdate=March 1, 2014 }}; {{cite web |author=Krijn Peters |url=http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/Monographs/No100/Contents.html |title=Re-Examining Voluntarism, Youth Combatants in Sierra Leone: Monograph No 100 |publisher=[http://iss.co.za Institute for Security Studies] |date=April 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615210147/http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/Monographs/No100/Contents.html |archivedate=June 15, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism has been a phrase used in labor relations.  In Britain, it means the state refrains from directly intervening in industrial relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/UNITED%20KINGDOM/VOLUNTARISM-EN.htm |title=United Kingdom, Voluntarism |publisher=Eurofound |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early American labor movement it meant trade unions should focus on "pure and simple" gains in wages and working conditions and not independent labor politics and [[industrial unionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Brian Robertson |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=38781 |title=Voluntarism Against the Open Shop: Labor and Business Strategies in the Battle for American Labor Markets] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |journal=Studies in American Political Development |date=April 1999 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=146–85 |accessdate=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Willful Liberalism: Voluntarism and Individuality in Political Theory and Practice'', [[Johns Hopkins University]] political science professor [[Richard E. Flathman]] argues that liberals must understand more about individuality and self-reliance and self-responsibility and therefore be more open of acceptance of voluntary action and less concerned with ordering political society. He notes, "Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all dispositions constantly form associations," which he describes as "of a thousand other kinds, religious, moral, serious, futile, general or restricted, enormous or diminutive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard E. Flathman |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xvqIeEeVSyIC&amp;dq=voluntarism&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP3,M1 |title=Willful Liberalism: Voluntarism and Individuality in Political Theory and Practice |publisher=[[Cornell University Press#press|Cornell University Press]] |year=1992 |page=76 |isbn=9780801499555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], voluntarism is an important aspect of the [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]], as well as other theories of [[social action]] and [[agency (sociology)|agency]].

[[Voluntaryism|Voluntaryists]], [[free market]] advocates, [[libertarians]] and [[anarchists]] call for voluntary efforts to replace most or all government efforts, using both moral and utilitarian arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David T.

==Examples from American history==

{{Globalise|USA|date=August 2018}}

Voluntary provision of services to the religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history.
* [[William Penn]], who established the Quakers in the late 17th century, preached taking responsibility for others and improving the world.
* [[Cotton Mather]], who lived during the colonial period, encouraged the formation of associations and causes.
* [[Benjamin Franklin]] organized a voluntary militia in Quaker-controlled Pennsylvania, whose pacifist legislature refused to support the American revolutionary war.
* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] noted the unusually large number of voluntary associations in America.
* The [[Underground Railroad]] was a network of volunteers who helped slaves escape from their captors in the South.
* [[Dorothea Dix]], a nurse, recruited and trained other women as nurses during the Civil War.
* [[Clara Barton]] also served as a Civil War nurse and went on to establish the American Red Cross in 1881 for relief of natural disasters, such as earthquakes.
* [[Jane Addams]] opened a settlement house in 1889 to teach volunteers how to help the poor improve their lives.
* In 1995, 93 million Americans volunteered an average of 4.3 hours per week.&lt;ref name="Perkins"/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Zilla'''|ジラ|Jira}}, originally known as '''Godzilla''', is a [[kaiju|film monster]] originating from [[TriStar Pictures]]'s ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1998). It was initially created as a reimagining of [[Toho]]'s [[Godzilla]] but was later re-branded as a separate character. It was designed, by [[Patrick Tatopoulos]], after marine iguanas with a slim theropod appearance as opposed to the bulky erect theropod designs of Toho's Godzilla. TriStar's Godzilla, both the film and character, were negatively received by fans and critics. Planned sequels were cancelled and an [[Godzilla: The Series|animated television series]] serving as a sequel was produced instead.

In 2004, TriStar's Godzilla was featured in Toho's ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' as "Zilla". Afterwards, Toho (the owners of Godzilla) began trademarking new incarnations as "Zilla", with only the iterations from the 1998 film and animated show retaining the Godzilla copyright/trademark. The character has since appeared in other media as "Zilla".

==Overview==
===Name===
[[File:Godzilla 1998 Icons.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Toho's and Sony's trademarks for TriStar's Godzilla and Baby Godzilla.]]
Initially, during production of ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', director [[Ryuhei Kitamura]] asked producer [[Shōgo Tomiyama]] whether or not they were allowed to include TriStar's Godzilla in the film, whereupon Tomiyama checked Toho's contract with [[Sony]] and saw they were allowed to use it, Tomiyama stated: "Kitamura asked me if it was possible for us to use the American Godzilla in Final Wars, so I checked our contract with Sony Pictures and found out we could use it. Since this was the 50th anniversary film, I thought ‘Why not include the American Godzilla?'" This incarnation of TriStar's Godzilla was named "Zilla".&lt;ref name="g94"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2015/05/31/godzilla-unmade-the-history-of-jan-de-bonts-unproduced-tristar-film-part-4-of-4/|title=Godzilla Unmade: The History of Jan De Bont’s Unproduced TriStar Film Part 4 of 4|last=Aiken|first=Keith|work=Scifi Japan|date=May 31, 2015|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was made because they also felt that Emmerich's film had taken the "God" out of "Godzilla" by portraying the character as a mere animal.&lt;ref name="penny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblood.com/godzilla2.html |title=Godzilla Stomps into Los Angeles |last=Schaefer |first=Mark |work=Penny Blood |date=November 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050203181104/http://www.pennyblood.com/godzilla2.html |archivedate=February 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Zilla" was chosen for the character by Tomiyama as a satirical take on [[counterfeit]] Godzilla products that use "Zilla" [[-zilla|as a suffix]].&lt;ref name="counter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsterzero.us/editorials/editorials.php?catID=Nws&amp;subCatID=15&amp;contentID=524 |title=Godzilla vs Zilla |last1=Figurski|first1=Jim|last2=Matsuda|first2=Takashi|publisher=Monster Zero News |date=August 27, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024093918/http://www.monsterzero.us/editorials/editorials.php?catID=Nws&amp;subCatID=15&amp;contentID=524 |archivedate=October 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Zillatrademark.png|thumb|left|130px|Toho's current trademark for future incarnations of TriStar's Godzilla.]]

The "Zilla" name has since been trademarked by Toho&lt;ref name="zillaactive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/zilla-76669021.html|title= Official Documentation showing "ZILLA" to be active, registered, and in effect|publisher=Legal Force|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trademarks.justia.com/766/69/zilla-76669021.html|title=ZILLA - Trademark Details|publisher=Justia Trademarks |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acuteip.com/trademarks/case/76669021|title=Trade Mark Serial No. 76669021|publisher=Acute IP|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this name change has been reflected in subsequent official products featuring the character since 2004, though "Godzilla" continues to be used on products that predate the name change, such as home media re-releases of the 1998 film or ''[[Godzilla: The Series]]''. Matt Frank (co-writer and illustrator of ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Rulers of Earth]]'') further clarified the name change, stating, "Toho makes zero distinction between "Zilla" and "Godzilla 1998" with the exception of title alone. Ever since 2004, Toho's official stance has been that any future incarnations of the character be referred to hereafter as 'Zilla'."&lt;ref name="g94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comments.deviantart.com/1/365062300/3045263732|title=Matt Frank on Zilla|last=Frank|first=Matt|work=Deviant Art|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Aiken (co-editor of SciFi Japan) also clarified that "Zilla is a variation of the 1998 Godzilla" but stressed that only the incarnations from the 1998 film and the animated series retain the Godzilla copyright and trademark.&lt;ref name="kaf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i.imgur.com/rw74Yk0.jpg|title=Keith Aiken Facebook|last=Aiken|first=Keith|work=Facebook|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="g94"/&gt;

[[File:Kurt Carley Godzilla Suit.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Kurt Carley performed the suitmation sequences for the adult Godzilla in the 1998 film.]]
During the production of the 1998 film, special effects artist [[Patrick Tatopoulos]] was contacted by director Roland Emmerich and asked to create a new design for the Godzilla character. According to Tatopoulos, the only specific instructions Emmerich gave him was that it should be able to run incredibly fast.&lt;ref name=Rickett2006/&gt;

Godzilla was originally conceived by special effects director [[Eiji Tsubaraya]], special effects designers Akira Wantanabe and Teizo Toshimitsu and director [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]] as a robust, erect-standing, [[plantigrade]] reptilian sea monster, played by an actor in a rubber-latex full-body suit. Based on the instructions Emmerich gave him, Tatopoulos reimagined it as a lean, [[digitigrade]] bipedal iguana that stood with its back and tail parallel to the ground, rendered via computer animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/jun98/godzilla/art1/pg1.htm |title=Godzilla Lives! - page 1 |publisher=Theasc.com |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monster's distinctive facial features include a prominent [[Prognathism|lantern jaw]], inspired by the fictional tiger [[Shere Khan]] from [[Disney]]'s animated adaptation of ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2013/04/story-notes-trivia-godzilla.php |title=Story Notes for Godzilla |publisher=Blogs.amctv.com |date=April 30, 2013 |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TriStar's Godzilla color scheme was designed to reflect and blend in with the urban environment.&lt;ref name=Rickett2006&gt;{{cite book |title=Designing Movie Creatures and Characters: Behind the Scenes With the Movie Masters |last=Rickitt |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Focal Press |location= |isbn=0-240-80846-0 |pages=74–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, it was planned to use [[motion capture]] to create the movements of the computer-generated monster, but it ended up looking too much like a man in a suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Rickitt| first = Richard| title = Special Effects: The History and Technique| publisher = Billboard Books| year = 2000| isbn = 0-8230-7733-0| page = 174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baby Godzilla scenes utilized a combination of CGI and purpose built costumes donned by actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it2oxGrYa98|title=Godzilla - Behind the Scenes - FX &amp; Baby Godzilla Costumes etc.|work=YouTube|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt Carley portrayed the [[suitmation]] sequences for the adult Godzilla in the 1998 film&lt;ref name="kc"/&gt; while [[Frank Welker]] provided the sound effects for both the adult Godzilla as well as the Baby Godzillas.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;

Upon pending approval for the design, at the time, [[Shōgo Tomiyama]] commented on the new look, saying "It was so different we realized we couldn't make small adjustments. That left the major question of whether to approve it or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/13/entertainment/ca-3197 |title='Godzilla' Returns Home Something of a Stranger - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=July 13, 1998 |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though TriStar's Godzilla was referred to by the film's characters as a "he", Patrick Tatopoulos stated on a DVD audio commentary that the effects crew sculpted female genitalia into the CG model of the creature.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Tatopoulos; Godzilla 1998 Region 1 DVD special features, "Special FX Supervisor Commentary" (Scene 14: "He's pregnant.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Atypical of Toho's giant monster characters, TriStar's Godzilla is not immune to conventional weaponry, and instead relies on its cunning and athleticism to outflank its enemies.

TriStar's Godzilla was featured in the 2004 Toho film ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' as "Zilla";&lt;ref name="penny"/&gt; this name would continue to be used and trademarked for later incarnations. A 3D scan of the [[Trendmasters]] "Ultimate Godzilla" toy was used as reference for Zilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2011/01/07/godzilla-the-series-the-lost-trendmasters-toy-line/ |title=GODZILLA: THE SERIES- The Lost Trendmasters Toy Line |work=SciFi Japan |accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Zilla engages Toho's Godzilla in a battle intended "to show which Godzilla is stronger".&lt;ref name="g94"/&gt; Zilla would fight Godzilla again in a slightly longer battle, and even team up with Godzilla to fight other monsters, in the comic series by [[IDW Publishing]] titled ''Godzilla: Rulers of Earth'' running between 2013-2015.&lt;ref name="Chris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idwpublishing.com/godzilla-rulers-of-earth-interview-with-writer-chris-mowry/ |title=Godzilla: Rulers of Earth Interview with Writer Chris Mowry |work=IDW Publishing |date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
The design and characterization of TriStar's Godzilla was negatively received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuketown.com/movies/reviews/cloverfield |title=Cloverfield: The monster movie Godzilla should have been |publisher=Nuketown |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic Richard Pusateri of ''G-Fan Magazine'' coined the [[acronym]] '''GINO''' ("'''G'''odzilla '''I'''n '''N'''ame '''O'''nly") to distinguish it from Toho's Godzilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/staff-contributors/#RichardPusateri |title=Staff &amp; Contributors « SciFi Japan |publisher=SciFi Japan|date=May 18, 1998 |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some fans referred to it as the "American Godzilla".&lt;ref name="counter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/03/24/dvd-reviews-godzilla-monster-edition-and-godzilla-the-series/|title=DVD Reviews: Godzilla: Monster Edition and Godzilla: The Series|last=Aiken|first=Keith|work=SciFi Japan|date=March 24, 2006|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major points of criticism were centered around the character's radical departure from the traditional Godzilla design, how it was portrayed fleeing from the military, how it did not breathe the traditional atomic heat ray, how it laid eggs, and was killed by missiles during the film's climax, as well as rejecting all the thematic elements, regarding nuclear warfare, of the original.&lt;ref&gt;"It Came from Japan!" Animal Planet documentary, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

These sentiments were echoed by veteran ''Godzilla'' suit actors [[Haruo Nakajima]] and [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]], and by [[Shusuke Kaneko]], director of the '90s ''[[Gamera]]'' films. Nakajima ridiculed the character design, stating: "Its face looks like an iguana and its body and limbs look like a frog".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/05/10/godzilla-is-back-and-bigger-then-ever/|title=Godzilla is back and bigger than ever|last=Getlen|first=Larry|work=New York Post|date=May 10, 2014|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satsuma walked out of the film, saying "it's not Godzilla, it doesn't have his spirit".{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=344}} Kaneko opined "[Americans] seem unable to accept a creature that cannot be put down by their arms",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/news/ie/daily/19980711/19250874.html |title=The US version |publisher=Expressindia.indianexpress.com |date=July 11, 1998 |accessdate=January 22, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015195729/http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/news/ie/daily/19980711/19250874.html |archivedate=October 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later alluded to the character in his film ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'' as a monster that Americans mistook for Godzilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godzillatemple.com/movie25.htm |title=Barry's Temple of Godzilla - Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: All Monsters Attack |publisher=Godzillatemple.com |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animated version of the character was more positively received than its live-action predecessor, due to being closer in line with the spirit of [[Godzilla|Toho's Godzilla]], possessing the ability to breathe atomic fire, battle monsters, and withstand attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cullum |first=Brett |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/godzillaanimated.php|title=DVD Verdict - Godzilla: The Series |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=July 24, 2014 |accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://japancinema.net/2013/06/05/godzilla-the-series-review-2/ |title=Godzilla: The Series – Review |publisher=Japan Cinema |date=June 5, 2013 |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the negative response to both Emmerich's ''Godzilla'' as well as the [[Disney]] remake of ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' released that same year, had caused giant monster movies to fall out of vogue for several years after, with films such as [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[King Kong (2005 film)|''King Kong'' remake]] being postponed until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonic-cinema.com/film_reviews_individual/133/king-kong |title=King Kong::film review |publisher=sonic-cinema.com |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor merchandise sales for the film led to a cancellation of a toy line based on ''Godzilla: The Series'', and resulted in significant financial losses for toy manufacturer Trendmasters.&lt;ref name="Trendmasters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2011/01/07/godzilla-the-series-the-lost-trendmasters-toy-line/|title=Godzilla: The Series - The Lost Trendmasters Toy Line|last=Shyman|first=Jonathan|last2=Aiken|first2=Keith|work=Scifi Japan|date=May 2012|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character has only made two film appearances in ''Godzilla'' (1998) and ''Godzilla: Final Wars'' (2004) and was vaguely referenced in ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'' (2001). A trilogy of films were originally planned, and a treatment by Tab Murphy for ''Godzilla 2'' was written, but the project was abandoned due to the poor reception of the 1998 film and TriStar let their license to Godzilla expire in 2003.&lt;ref name="g94"/&gt;

An animated television series, ''[[Godzilla: The Series]]'', was produced instead and served as a sequel to the 1998 film.&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/03/28/godzilla-the-series/|title=The Ultimate Guide to Godzilla: The Series|last1=Johnson|first1=Bob|last2=Aiken|first2=Keith|work=SciFi Japan|date=March 28, 2006|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran between September 12, 1998 to April 22, 2000 and featured the surviving offspring from the 1998 film as the new Godzilla as well as a reanimated cyborg version of the first Godzilla named "Cyber-Godzilla".&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide"/&gt; For the video games ''[[Godzilla: Save the Earth]]'' and ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]'', developer Simon Strange decided not to include Zilla due to the character's unpopularity among fans.
