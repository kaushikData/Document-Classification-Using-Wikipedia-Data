Many [[soil moisture]] [[measuring instrument|measuring instruments]] are based on the principle of '''Amplitude Domain Reflectometry (ADR)'''. This method measures the [[electrical impedance]]. [[Electromagnetic waves]] traveling along [[Transmission Line|Transmission Lines]] (TL) enter in soil medium whose impedance is different from TL a part of the energy is reflected back to transmitter. The reflected wave interferes with incident wave and produces a standing wave along the TL, this changes the amplitude of wave along the TL. The impedance can be measured from difference in amplitude. The impedance has two components: [[electrical conductivity]] and dielectric constant. The effect of conductivity can be minimized by selecting an appropriate frequency.

'''Andrew Ian McNamara''' (born 19 August 1959) is an [[Australia]]n politician. He was a [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Labor]] member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland]] from 2001 to 2009, representing the district of [[Electoral district of Hervey Bay|Hervey Bay]]. He served as Minister for Sustainability, Climate Change and Innovation from 2007 to 2009, under the premiership of [[Anna Bligh]]. Currently, Mr McNamara was the CEO of the [[Chiropractors' Association of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/chiropractic-fraternity-splits-over-allegations-of-mismanagement-20150708-gi7qxd.html|title=Chiropractic fraternity splits over allegations of mismanagement|last=|first=|date=11 July 2015|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=|access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peak oil==

In February 2005, McNamara came to national prominence as the first mainstream Australian politician to speak out on the issue of [[Peak Oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Running-on-empty/2005/04/01/1112302233942.html|title=Running On Empty|date=2 April 2005|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpublicmedia.com/lectures/360|title=Australian Politician Goes on record about Peak Oil and Gas|date=22 February 2005|publisher=Global Public Media|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309102033/http://www.globalpublicmedia.com/lectures/360|archivedate=9 March 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McNamara was the Chair of the Queensland Government's Oil Vulnerability Taskforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/items/200505/1373249.htm?widebay|title=New task force to tackle oil woes|date=20 May 2005|publisher=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taskforce report, "Queensland's Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices," also known as the [[McNamara Report]] was commissioned in 2005 and is the first of its kind to be commissioned by any government in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalpublicmedia.com/new_queensland_sustainability_minister_on_the_future_with_less_oil|title=New Queensland Sustainability Minister on the future with less oil|date=19 September 2007|publisher=Global Public Media|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011214724/http://globalpublicmedia.com/new_queensland_sustainability_minister_on_the_future_with_less_oil|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNamara is also the Foundation Patron of the Australian Association  for the Study of Peak Oil (ASPO).

==Climate change==
Andrew McNamara was a member of Australia's delegation to the Bali Climate Change Conference in December 2007. McNamara has also established a Climate Change Council with a number of prominent environmentalists and business leaders including [[Tim Flannery]] and [[Ian Lowe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/Id/55615|title=Media Statements|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2007|website=Queensland  Cabinet and Ministerial Directory|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-whaling==
Andrew McNamara has been a strong opponent of [[whaling]], particularly Japanese whaling in Australian waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-02-20/mcnamara-to-send-anti-whaling-message-to-japan/1048192|title=McNamara to send anti-whaling message to Japan|last=|first=|date=20 February 2008|website=ABC News|publisher=ABC|access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hervey Bay==
Andrew McNamara represented the seat of [[Electoral district of Hervey Bay|Hervey Bay]].  [[Hervey Bay]] is one of the fastest growing areas in [[Australia]].  The area's principal industry is tourism, in particular whale watching.

Seeking a fourth term, McNamara was defeated in the 2009 election by former Hervey Bay Mayor [[Ted Sorensen (politician)|Ted Sorensen]].

The '''Australian Integrated Forecast System''' (AIFS) is a [[UNIX]] and [[Linux]] -based processing, display, analysis and communications system for [[Meteorology|meteorological]] data.

It incorporates facilities for the ingest and storage of meteorological and [[Hydrology|hydrological]] observations, which can be displayed, analysed and manipulated on screen. Tools are also provided for alerting, [[chart]] plotting and the preparation and dissemination of [[Weather forecast|forecasts]] and warnings to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://ssu1.bom.gov.au/pub/ims/aifs.html{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIFS is currently running on [[AIX]], [[HP-UX]] and [[Linux]] platforms in [[Australia]], [[Fiji]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].

Development began in 1991 as a replacement for the Automated Regional Operations System (AROS), built on [[NonStop SQL|Tandem NonStop]] architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8904">In [[sedimentary geology]] and fluvial [[geomorphology]], '''avulsion''' is the rapid abandonment of a river channel and the formation of a new river channel. Avulsions occur as a result of channel slopes that are much less steep than the slope that the river could travel if it took a new course.&lt;ref name="SlingerlandSmith"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026&lt;0435:NCFAMR&gt;2.3.CO;2|title=Necessary conditions for a meandering-river avulsion|year=1998|last1=Slingerland|first1=Rudy|last2=Smith|first2=Norman D.|journal=Geology|volume=26|pages=435&amp;ndash;438|url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/26/5/435.abstract|issue=5|bibcode = 1998Geo....26..435S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deltaic and net-depositional settings==

[[Image:Mississippi Delta 1976.jpg|thumb|300px|Plumes of [[sediment]] enter the [[ocean]] from several [[river mouth|mouths]] of the [[Mississippi River]] [[bird's-foot delta]]. This sediment is responsible for building the [[River delta|delta]] and allowing it to advance into the sea. As it extends further offshore, the [[gradient (river)|channel slope]] will decrease and its bed will [[aggradation|aggrade]], promoting an avulsion.]]

Avulsions are common in [[River delta|river deltas]], where [[sediment]] [[deposition (geology)|deposits]] as the river enters the ocean and channel [[gradient]]s are typically very small.&lt;ref&gt;Marshak, Stephen (2001), Earth: Portrait of a Planet, New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, {{ISBN|0-393-97423-5}} pp. 528&amp;ndash;9&lt;/ref&gt; This process is also known as '''delta switching'''.

Deposition from the river results in the formation of an individual [[deltaic lobe]] that pushes out into the sea. An example of a deltaic lobe is the bird's-foot [[River delta|delta]] of the [[Mississippi River]], pictured at right with its [[sediment]] plumes. As the deltaic lobe advances, the [[slope]] of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see [[slope]] or [[gradient]]).  As the slope of the river channel decreases, it becomes unstable for two reasons. First, water under the force of [[gravity]] will tend to flow in the most direct course downslope. If the river could breach its natural [[levees]] (i.e., during a [[flood]]), it would spill out onto a new course with a shorter route to the ocean, thereby obtaining a more stable steeper slope.&lt;ref name="SlingerlandSmith" /&gt; Second, as its slope is reduced, the amount of [[shear stress]] on the bed will decrease, resulting in deposition of more sediment within the channel and thus raising of the channel bed relative to the [[floodplain]]. This will make it easier for the river to breach its levees and cut a new channel that enters the ocean at a steeper slope.

When this avulsion occurs, the new channel carries sediment out to the ocean, building a new deltaic lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Steven M. (1999) Earth System History. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, {{ISBN|0-7167-2882-6}} p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshak, pp. 528&amp;ndash;9&lt;/ref&gt;  The abandoned delta eventually subsides.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

This process is also related to the distributary network of river channels that can be observed within a river delta. When the channel does this, some of its flow can remain in the abandoned channel. When these channel switching events happen repeatedly over time, a mature delta will gain a distributary network.&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook, Don J.''Surface Processes and Landforms Second Edition''Prentice Hall, New Jersey: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Subsidence]] of the delta and/or [[sea-level rise]] can further cause [[Backwater (river)|backwater]] and deposition in the delta. This deposition fills the channels and leaves a geologic record of channel avulsion in [[sedimentary basin]]s. On average, an avulsion will occur every time the bed of a river channel [[aggradation|aggrades]] enough that the river channel is [[wikt:camber|superelevated]] above the floodplain by one channel-depth. In this situation, enough [[hydraulic head]] is available that any breach of the natural levees will result in an avulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=M.|last2=Falk|first2=P.|last3=Paola|first3=C.|title=Experimental study of avulsion frequency and rate of deposition|journal=Geology|date=1995|volume=23|issue=4|pages=365–368|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1995)023&lt;0365:ESOAFA&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode=1995Geo....23..365B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohrig|first1=D.|last2=Heller|first2=P.

==Erosional avulsions==

Rivers can also avulse due to the erosion of a new channel that creates a straighter path through the landscape. This can happen during large floods in situations in which the slope of the new channel is significantly greater than that of the old channel. Where the new channel's slope is about the same as the old channel's slope, a ''partial avulsion'' will occur in which both channels are occupied by flow.&lt;ref name="SlingerlandSmith 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slingerland|first1=Rudy|last2=Smith|first2=Norman D.|title=RIVER AVULSIONS AND THEIR DEPOSITS|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|volume=32|pages=257|year=2004|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.32.101802.120201|bibcode = 2004AREPS..32..257S }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an erosional avulsion is the 2006 avulsion of the [[Suncook River]] in [[New Hampshire]], in which heavy rains caused flow levels to rise. The river level backed up behind an old mill dam, which produced a shallowly-sloping pool that overtopped a sand and gravel quarry, connected with a downstream section of channel, and cut a new shorter channel at 25–50 meters per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perignon|first=M. C.|title=Mechanisms governing avulsions in transient landscapes: Analysis of the May 2006 Suncook River Avulsion in Epsom, New Hampshire|year=2007|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|type = S.B. Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sediment mobilised by this erosional avulsion produced a depositionally-forced meander cutoff further downstream by superelevating the bed around the meander bend to nearly the level of the floodplain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perignon|first=M. C.|title=Sediment wave-induced channel evolution following the 2006 avulsion of the Suncook River in Epsom, New Hampshire|year=2008|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|format = S.B. Thesis|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/45792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meander cutoffs==

An example of a minor avulsion is known as a [[meander cutoff]], where the high-[[sinuosity]] [[meander]] bend is abandoned in favour of the high-slope (i.e Large bending meander has river cut through a straighter course, and the meander has water drain away) This occurs when the ratio between the channel slope and the potential slope after an avulsion is less than about 1/5.&lt;ref name="SlingerlandSmith" /&gt;

==Occurrence==

Avulsion typically occurs during large floods which carry the power necessary to rapidly change the landscape. Dam removal could also lead to avulsion.

Avulsions usually occur as a downstream to upstream process via head cutting erosion. If a bank of a current stream is breached a new trench will be cut into the existing floodplain. It either cuts through floodplain deposits or reoccupies an old channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nanson | first1 = G.C. | last2 = Knighton | first2 = A.D. | year = 1996 | title = Anabranching rivers: Their cause, character, and classification | url = | journal = Earth Surface Processes and Landforms | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 217–39 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9837(199603)21:3&lt;217::AID-ESP611&gt;3.0.CO;2-U | bibcode = 1996ESPL...21..217N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avulsions have been investigated in the deltas or coastal plain channels as a result of obstructions such as log-jams and possible tectonic influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=J.

'''The Museum of Nature and Environment of the Republic of Belarus''' is a [[museum]] in [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]], founded in 1991 at [[Minsk]] on the basis of the nature of [[Belarusian National History and Culture Museum]]. There are more than 40 thousand exhibits inside an exposition area of 350 m². In the 6 thematic rooms (mineralogical, fenalagichny, nature, river, lake, forest) exhibits tell about the natural riches of the evolution of flora and fauna from antiquity to the present day. Carrying out research work to assess the current state of nature, it creates a database (the collection of flora, fauna, mineralogy, paleontology) and promotes environmental knowledge.

In the time leading up to the Boring Billion, Earth experienced multiple widespread [[Glacial period|glaciations]], the origin of [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] life, the introduction of [[oxygen]] into the atmosphere with the evolution of [[cyanobacteria]], addition of UV-blocking [[Ozone layer|ozone]] to the atmosphere, and the oxidizing of [[iron]] in the oceans.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book

== Climatic stability ==
[[File:Timeline showing the Boring Billion.png|thumb|700x700px|Atmospheric oxygen levels over geological time on Earth]]
Recent scientific studies on the Boring Billion have found little [[evidence]] of significant climatic variability during this time period.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A billion years of environmental stability and the emergence of eukaryotes: New data from northern Australia|last = Brasier|first = M.D.|date = 1998|journal = Geology|doi =10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026&lt;0555:abyoes&gt;2.3.co;2 |pmid = |bibcode = 1998Geo....26..555B |volume=26 |issue = 6|page=555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different [[Theory|theories]] have been developed by individual scientists to explain the inferred climatic stability, while others&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; attribute the lack of evidence to an absence of suitable records. There is currently no generally accepted theory in the scientific community on the cause(s) of the climatic stability during the Boring Billion.

=== Tectonic constraints ===
The evolution of Earth’s [[biosphere]], atmosphere and [[hydrosphere]] has long been linked to the [[supercontinent cycle]], through which the Earth’s [[continental crust]] undergoes a periodic cycle of aggregation and dispersal. The period of the Boring Billion is characterized by the evolution of two different supercontinents: [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] and [[Rodinia]]. The supercontinent Columbia [[amalgamation (geology)|amalgamated]] between 2.0 and 1.7 Ga and remained as a quasi-integral continental lid until at least 1.3 Ga. Several breakup attempts were unsuccessful. [[Geology|Geological]] and [[Paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] evidence suggest that Columbia underwent only minor changes to form the supercontinent Rodinia during the period from 1.1 to 0.9 Ga. [[Palaeogeography|Paleogeographic]] reconstructions suggest that the supercontinent assemblage was located in [[equator]]ial and [[Temperate climate|temperate]] climate zones throughout the intervening time frame; there is little or no evidence for continental fragments in [[Polar region|polar]] latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reconstructing pre-Pangean supercontinents|year=2013|journal = Geological Society of America Bulletin|pages = 1735–1751|volume = 125|issue = 11–12|doi = 10.1130/b30950.1|first = D. A. D.|last = Evans|bibcode = 2013GSAB..125.1735E}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of the limited breakup history is the lack of [[passive margin]]s during the time period from 1.8 to 0.8 Ga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Passive margins through earth history|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825208000871|journal = Earth-Science Reviews|date = 2008-12-01|pages = 1–26|volume = 91|issue = 1–4|doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2008.08.001|first = Dwight C.|last = Bradley|bibcode = 2008ESRv...91....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stable configuration provides the primary constraint on the environmental stasis that characterizes the oceans, atmosphere, and biosphere. The breakup of Rodinia at approximately 0.75 Ga is considered the end of Earth’s Boring Billion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It should be noted that numerous reconstructions of Columbia’s paleogeography exist and consensus has yet to be reached. Evaluating the evidence of paleo poles and continent location becomes increasingly more difficult as deposits get older and relevant rock units show increasing levels of deformation and fragmentation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The relative scarcity of passive margins during the Boring Billion, which are created during times of continental breakup, is proposed to support the presence of a stable continental configuration enabling environmental and climate stability during this time period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, it is also stated in the literature that in spite of the amalgamation of the supercontinents Columbia and Rodinia, relatively stable climatological conditions during the Boring Billion are consistent with a balance between [[weathering]] intensity, [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] [[temperature]]s and [[Solar luminosity|solar insolation]] throughout much of this time period.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A mechanism put forward to explain low tectonic variability is related to the temperature of the [[asthenosphere]], which may have been too hot to sustain modern plate tectonics in the early stages of the Earth’s evolution. Instead of vigorous plate recycling at [[Subduction|subduction zones]], plates were linked together for billions of years until the mantle cooled off enough to further sustain plate motions and the subsequent formation of subduction zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 2016-02-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of this component of plate tectonics may have been aided by the thickening of the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] that, once initiated, caused plate subduction to be anomalously strong.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This process occurred around 750 Ma ago, when the crust reached a temperature low enough to initiate and sustain plate tectonics in general and subduction processes in particular.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Cosmic activity ===
The absence of glaciation could be linked to the intensity of [[cosmic ray]] flux, and it is believed that periods of glaciation may be linked to periods with low cosmic ray flux due fluctuations in [[solar wind]] variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Celestial Climate Driver: A Perspective from Four Billion Years of the Carbon Cycle|url = https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/GC/article/view/2691|journal = Geoscience Canada|date = 2005-03-01|issn = 1911-4850|volume = 32|issue = 1|first = Ján|last = Veizer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible cause is the rate of [[star formation]] in the [[Milky Way]]. The reduced rate in star formation may be linked to diminished glaciations from 1 to 2 Ga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Absence of prolonged glaciations ===
The Boring Billion as a time period is unique in a sense that it seems to lack any significant periods of prolonged glaciations that can be observed in regular periodicity in other parts of Earth's geologic history.

Some researchers&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Glacio-epochs and the supercontinent cycle after ∼ 3.0 Ga: Tectonic boundary conditions for glaciation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018207005032|journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date = 2008-02-13|pages = 89–129|volume = 258|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.09.021|first = Nick|last = Eyles}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe, however, that the proposed lack of an [[ozone layer]], as expected during periods of low concentrations of atmospheric oxygen, in combination with lower solar intensity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Palaeoclimates: the first two billion years|url = http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/917|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2006-06-29|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 1868609|pmid = 16754607|pages = 917–929|volume = 361|issue = 1470|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2006.1839|language = en|first = James F.|last = Kasting|first2 = Shuhei|last2 = Ono}}&lt;/ref&gt; during that time period should have precluded the absence of glaciation without an intense [[greenhouse effect]].

Instead, the absence of a glacial record may be a function of data infidelity rather than a real feature of geologic time. Evidence for this are old glacially cut channels, which were found in the Kimberley district of [[Western Australia]] that have been dated to 1.8 Ga.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Subglacial meltwater channels and glaciofluvial deposits in the Kimberley Basin, Western Australia: 1.8 Ga low-latitude glaciation coeval with continental assembly|year=2005|journal = Journal of the Geological Society|pages = 111–124|volume = 162|issue = 1|doi = 10.1144/0016-764903-157|first = G.

== Low oxygen levels ==
Earth's geologic record indicates two events associated with significant increases in oxygen levels on Earth, with one occurring between 2.4 and 2.1 Ga, known as the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] (GOE), and the second occurring an approximate 0.8 Ga.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oxygen fluctuations stalled life on Earth|year=2014|first=Jane|last=Qiu|url = http://www.nature.com/news/oxygen-fluctuations-stalled-life-on-earth-1.15529|journal = Nature|access-date = 2017-02-24|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of time between these two oxygenations is thought to have been characterized by low levels of atmospheric oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Researchers postulate this widespread [[Dead zone (ecology)|anoxia]] was far greater than the anoxic [[Deep sea|deep oceans]] seen today (less than 1% of deep ocean). The cause and extent of the oxidation events and the subsequent billion years in between are subject to active debate. Although it was previously believed that atmospheric oxygen levels increased gradually through this period, new research has suggested that after the GOE – in which O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels spiked over 1,000 fold – oxygen levels dropped significantly and remained low (with minor fluctuations) until the second oxygenation event around 0.8 Ga.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The [[Lomagundi Excursion Event]] is considered to be the most prominent [[Isotopes of carbon|carbon isotope]] event in Earth’s history and can provide evidence for this large increase and subsequent decline in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For this event, a release of 10 to 20 times the current atmospheric oxygen is predicted based on levels found in the carbonate [[δ13C]] record around the time of the GOE.

He also proposed that the ocean was characterized high levels of [[hydrogen sulfide]] during this time, creating a [[euxinic]] environment. His explanation has become known as the [[Canfield ocean|Canfield Ocean]] hypothesis. It is believed that the low and fluctuating oxygen levels that characterized the Boring Billion effectively stalled evolution of complex life for the extent of the Boring Billion. The hypothesis of a predominantly globally euxinic ocean, with low to no oxygen, supports the theory of stalled evolution of complex animals throughout the Boring Billion. Complexity is believed to have evolved at the onset of a second oxygenation event and subsequent oxygenation of the ocean between 600-800 Ba.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Canfield ocean hypothesis ===
{{Main article|Canfield ocean|l1=Canfield Ocean}}

Donald Canfield proposed a hypothesis to explain how life persisted in the ocean despite low levels of oxygen.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is believed that during the Boring Billion, the ocean’s surface contained low levels of oxygen as a byproduct of oxygenic photosynthesis from cyanobacteria. Due to increased oxygen levels in the atmosphere, chemical weathering of the continents oxidized the mineral [[pyrite]] and transported [[sulfate]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) to the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process, the ocean became rich in [[sulfur]], and the ocean became a two layer system, consisting of a surface layer, high in oxygen, and a bottom layer, high in sulfur and low in oxygen. Canfield proposed that at the boundary between the two layers, green sulfur bacteria and purple bacteria served to convert the sulfur to [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). This process of deep sea sulfide creation led to high amounts of pyrite formation during the Boring Billion, and allowed for the chemical events that enabled the evolution of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Johnston ocean hypothesis ===
Like the Canfield Ocean model, the Johnston hypothesis serves as a potential explanation of causal factors for tempered oxygenic production. The model ultimately claims that [[sulfide]] driven anoxic photosynthesis via sulfidic prokaryotes helped sustain a long period of deep ocean anoxia, and more specifically, euxinia. This period ended with the exhaustion of sulfide resources, leading to the coupling of oxygenic production and [[carbon burial]] that is characteristic of today’s oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/106/40/16925.full.pdf?sid=72e2e6e7-5a46-4b2c-aff8-29814e23347f|title = Anoxygenic photosynthesis modulated Proterozoic oxygen and sustained Earth's middle age|last = Johnston|first = D.T.|date = 2009|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0909248106 |pmid = 19805080|pmc = 2753640|access-date =|volume=106|issue = 40|pages=16925–16929|bibcode =2009PNAS..10616925J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first order, Johnson’s take on the Canfield model is to recognize that maintaining the anoxygenic conditions requisite for a billion years would be difficult: as [[organic matter]] sinks, it [[Decomposition|decays]] and consumes oxygen, a process which is exacerbated by anoxygenic photosynthesis. It has been hypothesized that an explanation for this discrepancy could be anoxygenic photosynthesis, a primary production pathway that does not involve oxygen production as a byproduct. In this case, the consumption of oxygen by [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] is not balanced by oxygen generation through primary production. A modern example of such a system is best exemplified in parts of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Oxygen During the Boring Billion.png|left|thumb|350x350px|Research using chromium isotope analysis provides evidence for a decrease in atmospheric oxygen levels during the Boring Billion]]

=== Further evidence ===
Gaps in the evidence from ancient rocks have failed to explain the discrepancy between Earth’s atmospheric and oceanic oxygen levels. By tracing the movement of [[Isotopes of chromium|chromium isotopes]] from land to ocean, a process that is sensitive to atmospheric oxygen levels, the earliest signs of significant chromium oxidation have been found. This suggests levels of atmospheric oxygen to have significantly increased around 800 million years ago. Small amounts of oxygen can convert insoluble chromium, a constituent of the continental crust to a soluble form which is then transported to the ocean and deposited in [[ironstone]]. By studying the chromium isotope composition in ancient ironstones, measuring the ratio of heavier &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr (which is more sensitive to oxidation) to the lighter &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, researchers can determine ancient oxygen levels. This research revealed very low oxygen levels during the Boring Billion, which are below 0.1% of present atmospheric levels.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Rather than iron oxidation involving [[Iron(III) oxide|iron (III)]], pyrite formation (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) involves the uptake of iron (II) during euxinic conditions. A research team from the University of Tasmania, under the geologist Ross Large, measured levels of pyrite in ancient [[seafloor]] rocks to show that after the initial burst of oxygen 2.4–2.1 Ga there was a decline in oxygen levels until the second oxidation event around 800–600 Ma.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web

== Earth's first eukaryotes ==
In comparison to the great increase in diversity during the [[Cambrian explosion]], the evolution of life during the Boring Billion was relatively slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why did evolution stall during the 'boring billion'?|year=2014|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229672-900-why-did-evolution-stall-during-the-boring-billion/|website = New Scientist|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-US|first = Jeff|last = Hecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this period did see the occurrence of several major events in the history of evolution, specifically the development of [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, the evolution of [[multicellularity]] and the [[evolution of sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Several steps were required in the evolution of eukaryotes from a prokaryotic ancestor including a reorganization of DNA within cells and the acquisition of organelles.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The first eukaryotes originated sometime between 2.3 and 1.1 billion years ago, around the beginning of the Boring Billion.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The precise onset of eukaryotic evolution is hard to determine, but evidence for the presence of eukaryotic cells during this period can be found in the [[fossil]] record and molecular fossils.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; After eukaryotic cells evolved, multicellularity appeared.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By 1.8 Ga the first living things on planet Earth that were big enough to see with the naked eye had appeared.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  By the end of the Boring Billion, multicellular algae, fungi, and animals inhabited Earth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Almost all of this life was restricted to Earth's oceans, but near the end of the Boring Billion the first terrestrial life, a proto-lichen, colonized land.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Steps required for eukaryotic evolution ===
There is no agreed upon theory for the evolutionary steps that led to the appearance of the first eukaryotes, including the origin of the nucleus, cytoskeleton, and organelles that distinguish eukaryotes from prokaryotes (See "Hypotheses for the origin of eukaryotes" within the [[Eukaryote]] page). There are several changes that must have occurred as eukaryotic life evolved: an increase in genetic complexity, the development of an advanced [[cytoskeleton]], a loss of the rigid [[Cell wall|bacterial outer wall]], and the acquisition of membrane-bound [[organelle]]s within [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== DNA reorganization ====
Eukaryotic cells are generally much more complex than prokaryotic cells. When eukaryotic life evolved, an increase in genetic material was necessary to enable this complexity. With an increase in the amount of genetic material inside cells as eukaryotes were evolving, the evolution of entirely new structures and mechanisms of gene copying was required, leading to the development of the eukaryotic [[cell cycle]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

[[Histone]]s likely appeared during the Boring Billion to help organize the increasing amount of [[DNA]] in ancestral eukaryotic cells.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; DNA was packed by histones into the first [[chromosome]]s. A system of more rapid eukaryotic [[DNA replication]] in which DNA was replicated from multiple replication origins was developed so that cells containing much more genetic material would still be able to reproduce quickly.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Advanced cytoskeleton ====
The development of an advanced [[cytoskeleton]] was necessary to organize the chromosomes during asexual cell [[Mitosis|replication]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; After the loss of the rigid bacterial outer wall, the advanced cytoskeleton allowed the cells to flow and move.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The loss of the rigid bacterial cell wall, which helped prevent water from entering the cell and diluting the cytoplasm, required ancestral eukaryotes to develop pumping mechanisms to counteract osmosis.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Once the advanced cytoskeleton was in place and cell wall removed, ancestral eukaryotic cells had the ability to flow around and engulf other cells using the process of [[phagocytosis]], which is a more efficient way of obtaining nutrients than the system of external absorption used by prokaryotes.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Acquisition of organelles (first endosymbiosis) ====
The ability to ingest other cells enabled ancestral eukaryotes to build a much more complex cell.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Once the capacity for consuming other cells was in place, early eukaryotes began to acquire internal membrane-bound organelles that included organelles that were once free-living prokaryotes.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Based on [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] and structural evidence, it is generally accepted that [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] were originally derived from a free-living [[Proteobacteria|a-proteobacterium]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The bacterium was engulfed by an ancient cell, likely an [[Archaea]], and entered into the first [[Endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic relationship]] with its new [[Host (biology)|host]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Most models have explained the origin of the [[endosymbiosis]] in terms of the advantage gained by the host cell due to the greater energy production available through aerobic [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] (32 net [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] vs. 2 net for [[Glycolysis cycle|glycolysis]]). However, this hypothesis has several limitations. No known organism exports ATP to its environment, making it unlikely that a bacterium would begin doing so to its host.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An Overview of Endosymbiotic Models for the Origins of Eukaryotes, Their ATP-Producing Organelles (Mitochondria and Hydrogenosomes), and Their Heterotrophic Lifestyle : Biological Chemistry|year=2005|doi=10.1515/BC.2001.187

According to the Hydrogen Hypothesis, the original endosymbiotic event was between a hydrogen-producing bacterium and a hydrogen-consuming [[Archaea|archaeon]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Energy metabolism among eukaryotic anaerobes in light of Proterozoic ocean chemistry|url = http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/363/1504/2717|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2008-08-27|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 2606767|pmid = 18468979|pages = 2717–2729|volume = 363|issue = 1504|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0031|language = en|first = Marek|last = Mentel|first2 = William|last2 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symbiosis would have been advantageous in the anoxic conditions in the deeper reaches of the oceans at that time and would explain the widespread phylogenetic distribution of anaerobic respiration genes among eukaryotes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One other hypothesis is that a sulfur-metabolizing archaea and the ancestor of mitochondria lived in proximity, each feeding on the other's waste products and deriving energy through the recycling of [[sulfur]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Searcy|first=Dennis G.|last2=Hixon|first2=William G.|date=1991-01-01|title=Cytoskeletal origins in sulfur-metabolizing archaebacteria|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0303264791900089|journal=Biosystems|series=Papers presented at the 8th Biennial Conference of the International Society for Evolutionary Protistology|volume=25|issue=1–2|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/0303-2647(91)90008-9|pmid=1906756}}&lt;/ref&gt; When environmental conditions became harsh for one partner, the energy generation and recycling system became internalized and the archaeon and ancestral mitochondria fused to form one organism.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[Chloroplast]]s are also considered endosymbionts and were likely acquired during the Boring Billion in the same manner as mitochondria.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It is generally accepted that chloroplasts are descendants of a free-living oxygen-producing [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

After the first eukaryotes appeared, the diversification and evolution of eukaryotes proceeded slowly.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Environmental conditions, especially the presence of toxic sulfide, lack of oxygen in ocean water, lack of key nutrients and [[trace metal]]s in ocean water, and/or little tectonic activity, contributed to slow eukaryotic evolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low oxygen levels in ocean water during the Boring Billion may have kept eukaryotes in low numbers and prevented the evolution of large energy hungry, fast moving animals that evolved at the end of the Boring Billion,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Low Mid-Proterozoic atmospheric oxygen levels and the delayed rise of animals|url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/635|journal = Science|date = 2014-10-31|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 25359975|pages = 635–638|volume = 346|issue = 6209|doi = 10.1126/science.1258410|language = en|first = Noah J.|last = Planavsky|first2 = Christopher T.|last2 = Reinhard|first3 = Xiangli|last3 = Wang|first4 = Danielle|last4 = Thomson|first5 = Peter|last5 = McGoldrick|first6 = Robert H.|last6 = Rainbird|first7 = Thomas|last7 = Johnson|first8 = Woodward W.|last8 = Fischer|first9 = Timothy W.|last9 = Lyons|bibcode = 2014Sci...346..635P}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it has been argued that even with very little oxygen, animals could have emerged and persevered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oxygen and animal evolution: Did a rise of atmospheric oxygen "trigger" the origin of animals?|journal = BioEssays|date = 2014-12-01|issn = 1521-1878|pages = 1145–1155|volume = 36|issue = 12|doi = 10.1002/bies.201400101|language = en|first = Daniel B.|last = Mills|first2 = Donald E.|last2 = Canfield|pmid=25244426}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that diversification of eukaryotes began well before the onset of global [[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenation]] of the oceans, leading to the conclusion that [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions could not be the only cause of slow eukaryotic evolution.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Despite these environmental constraints, eukaryotes developed multicellularity during the Boring Billion and a major diversification of eukaryotes occurred at the supergroup level between 1.9 and 0.75 Ga.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Key biological innovations such as cell differentiation, [[Evolution of sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]], and eukaryotic [[photosynthesis]] separated eukaryotes into [[animal]]s, [[algae]], and [[Fungus|fungi]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Multicellularity ===
The evolution of cell [[Chemical polarity|polarity]], which allows cells to send a molecular message to one side of the cell but not the other and to interact with nearby cells, allowed the development of organized multicellularity during the Boring Billion.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Qingshania, a small spiral coil that appears in the fossil record 1.7 Ga, is the oldest known fossil multicellular eukaryote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Significance of eukaryotic organisms in the microfossil flora of Changeheng system|last = Yan|first = Y|date = 1993|journal = Acta Micropalaeontologica Sinica|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dàshǔ''''', ''Taisho'', ''Daeseo'', or ''Đại thử'' ({{CJKV|t=大暑|s=大暑|p=dàshǔ|j=大暑|r=taisho|k=대서|rr=daeseo|v=đại thử|l=major heat}}) is the 12th solar term. It begins when the Sun reaches the [[celestial longitude]] of 120° and ends when it reaches the longitude of 135°. It more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 120°.

The '''electrokinematics theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;Pellegrini, B. (1986), "Electric charge motion, induced current, energy balance, and noise", Phys. Rev. B 34: 5921-5924.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="note2"&gt;Pellegrini, B.(1993), "Extension of the electrokinematics theorem to the electromagnetic field and quantum mechanics", Il Nuovo Cimento 15 D: 855–879.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="note3"&gt;Pellegrini, B.(1993), "Elementary application of quaantum-electrokinematics theorem to the electromagnetic field and quantum mechanics", Il Nuovo Cimento 15 D: 881-896.&lt;/ref&gt; connects the velocity and the [[Electric charge|charge]] of [[Charge carrier|carriers]] moving inside an arbitrary volume to the currents, voltages and power on its surface through an arbitrary [[Conservative vector field#Irrotational vector fields|irrotational vector]]. Since it contains, as a particular application, the [[Shockley–Ramo theorem|Ramo-Shockley theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramo, S.(1939), "Currents induced by electron motion", Proc. IRE 27: 584–585.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shockley, W. (1938), Currents to conductors induced by a moving point charge, J. App. Phys. 9: 635-636.&lt;/ref&gt; the electrokinematics theorem is also known as '''Ramo-Shockly-Pellegrini theorem'''.

==Statement==
To introduce the electrokinematics theorem let us first list a few definitions: ''q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the electric charge, position and velocity, respectively, at the time t of the ''j''th charge carrier; &lt;math&gt;A_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E=-\nabla A_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; are the [[electric potential]], [[Electric field|field]], and [[Electric permittivity|permittivity]], respectively, &lt;math&gt;J_{q}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J_{d}=\varepsilon \partial E/ \partial t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J=J_{q}+J_{d}&lt;/math&gt; are the conduction, displacement and, in a 'quasi-electrostatic' assumption, total current density, respectively; &lt;math&gt;F=-\nabla \Phi&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary irrotational vector in an arbitrary volume &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; enclosed by the surface S, with the constraint that &lt;math&gt;\nabla (\varepsilon F)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Now let us integrate over &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; the scalar product of the vector &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by the two members of the above-mentioned current equation. Indeed, by applying the divergence theorem, the vector identity &lt;math&gt;a\cdot\nabla\gamma=\nabla\cdot(\gamma a)-\gamma\nabla\cdot a&lt;/math&gt;, the above-mentioned constraint and the fact that &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot J=0&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the electrokinematics theorem in the first form

:&lt;math&gt;-\int_{S} \Phi J\cdot dS=\int_{\Omega}J_{q}\cdot Fd^{3}r-\int_{S}\varepsilon\frac{\partial A_{0}}{\partial t}F\cdot dS&lt;/math&gt; ,

which, taking into account the corpuscular nature of the current &lt;math&gt;J_{q}=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)} q_{j}\delta(r-r_{j})v_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\delta(r-r_{j})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta function]] and ''N(t)'' is the carrier number in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; at the time ''t'', becomes

:&lt;math&gt;-\int_{S} \Phi J\cdot dS=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)} q_{j}v_{j}\cdot F(r_{j})-\int_{S}\varepsilon\frac{\partial A_{0}}{\partial t}F\cdot dS&lt;/math&gt; .

A component &lt;math&gt;A_{Vk}[r,V_{k}(t)]=V_{k}(t)\psi_{k}(r)&lt;/math&gt; of the total electric potential &lt;math&gt;A_{0}=A_{Vk}+A_{qj}&lt;/math&gt; is due to the voltage &lt;math&gt;V_{k}(t)&lt;/math&gt; applied to the ''k''th electrode on ''S'', on which &lt;math&gt;\psi_{k}(r)=1&lt;/math&gt; (and with the other boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;\psi_{k}(r)=\psi_{k}(\infty)=0&lt;/math&gt; on the other electrodes and for &lt;math&gt;r \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;), and each component &lt;math&gt;A_{qj}[r,r_{j}(t)]&lt;/math&gt; is due to the ''j''th charge carrier ''q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' , being &lt;math&gt;A_{qj}[r,r_{j}(t)]=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_j(t)&lt;/math&gt; over any electrode and for &lt;math&gt;r \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, let the surface ''S'' enclosing the volume &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; consist of a part &lt;math&gt;S_{E}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}S_{k}&lt;/math&gt; covered by ''n'' electrodes and an uncovered part &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt;.

According to the above definitions and boundary conditions, and to the [[superposition theorem]], the second equation can be split into the contributions

:&lt;math&gt;-\int_{S_{E}} \Phi J_{q}\cdot dS=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)} q_{j}v_{j}\cdot F(r_{j})+\sum_{j=1}^{M(t)}\int_{S_{R}}\varepsilon(\Phi\frac{\partial E_{j}}{\partial t}-\frac{\partial A_{qj}}{\partial t}F)\cdot dS&lt;/math&gt; ,

:&lt;math&gt;-\int_{S_{E}} \Phi J_{V}\cdot dS=\sum_{k=1}^n \int_{S_{R}}\varepsilon \Phi \frac{\partial E_{k}}{\partial t} \cdot dS-\sum_{k=1}^n \int_{S}\varepsilon \frac{\partial A_{Vk}}{\partial t} F\cdot dS&lt;/math&gt;,

relative to the carriers and to the electrode voltages, respectively, &lt;math&gt;M(t)&lt;/math&gt; being the total number of carriers in the space, inside and outside &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, at time ''t'', &lt;math&gt;E_{j}=-\nabla A_{qj}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{k}=-\nabla A_{Vk}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The integrals of the above equations account for the displacement current, in particular across &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt;.

==Current and capacitance==

One of the more meaningful application of the above equations is to compute the current

:&lt;math&gt;i_{h}\equiv-\int_{S_{h}}J\cdot dS=i_{qh}+i_{Vh}&lt;/math&gt; ,

through an ''h''th electrode of interest corresponding to the surface &lt;math&gt;S_{h}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_{qh}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i_{Vh}&lt;/math&gt; being the current due to the carriers and to the electrode voltages, to be computed through third and fourth equations, respectively.

===Open devices===

Let us consider as a first example, the case of a surface ''S'' that is not completely covered by electrodes, i.e., &lt;math&gt;S_{R} \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, and let us choose [[Dirichlet boundary conditions]] &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\Phi_{h}=1&lt;/math&gt; on the ''h''th electrode of interest and of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{h}=0&lt;/math&gt; on the other electrodes so that, from the above equations we have

:&lt;math&gt;i_{qh}=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}v_{j}\cdot F_{h}(r_{j})+\sum_{j=1}^{M(t)}\int_{S_{R}}\varepsilon(\Phi_{h}\frac{\partial E_{j}}{\partial t}-\frac{\partial A_{qj}}{\partial t}F_{h})\cdot dS=&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;i_{dh}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}C_{hk}\frac{dV_{k}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;F=F_{h}(r_{j})&lt;/math&gt; is relative to the above-mentioned boundary conditions and &lt;math&gt;C_{hk}&lt;/math&gt; is a capacitive coefficient of the ''h''th electrode given by

:&lt;math&gt;C_{hk}=-(\int_{S_{k}}\varepsilon F_{h}\cdot dS+\int_{S_{R}}\varepsilon(\Phi_{h}\nabla\psi_{k}+\psi_{k}F_{h})\cdot dS)&lt;/math&gt; .

&lt;math&gt;V_{h}&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage difference between the ''h''th electrode and an electrode held to a constant voltage (DC), for instance, directly connected to ground or through a DC voltage source. The above equations hold true for the above Dirichlet conditions for &lt;math&gt;\Phi_h&lt;/math&gt; and for any other choice of boundary conditions on &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt;.

A second case can be that in which &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{h}=0&lt;/math&gt; also on &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; so that such equations reduce to

:&lt;math&gt;i_{qh}=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}v_{j}\cdot F_h(r_{j})-\sum_{j=1}^{M(t)}\int_{S_{R}}\varepsilon\frac{\partial A_{0j}}{\partial t}F_{h}\cdot dS&lt;/math&gt; ,

:&lt;math&gt;C_{hk}=-(\int_{S_{k}}\varepsilon F_{h}\cdot dS+\int_{S_{R}}\varepsilon\Psi_{k}F_{h}\cdot dS)&lt;/math&gt; .

As a third case, exploiting also to the arbitrariness of &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; , we can choose a [[Neumann boundary condition]] of &lt;math&gt;F_{h}&lt;/math&gt; tangent to &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; in any point. Then the equations become

:&lt;math&gt;i_{qh}=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}v_{j}\cdot F_{h}(r_{j})-\sum_{j=1}^{M(t)}\int_{S_{R}}\varepsilon\Phi_{h}\frac{\partial E_{j}}{\partial t}\cdot dS&lt;/math&gt; ,

:&lt;math&gt;C_{hk}=-(\int_{S_{k}}\varepsilon F_{h}\cdot dS+\int_{S_{R}}\varepsilon\nabla\Psi_{h}\cdot dS)&lt;/math&gt; .

In particular, this case is useful when the device is a right parallelepiped, being &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_E&lt;/math&gt; the lateral surface and the bases, respectively.

As a fourth application let us assume &lt;math&gt;\Phi=1&lt;/math&gt; in the whole the volume &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;F=0&lt;/math&gt; in it, so that from the first equation of Section 1 we have

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{h=1}^{n}i_{h}-\int_{S_{R}}\varepsilon(\sum_{j=1}^{M(t)}\frac{\partial E_{j}}{\partial t}+\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\partial E_{k}}{\partial t})\cdot dS=0&lt;/math&gt; ,

which recover the [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff law]] with the inclusion the displacement current across the surface &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; that is not covered by electrodes.

===Enclosed devices===

A fifth case, historically significant, is that of electrodes that completely enclose the volume &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of the device, i.e. &lt;math&gt;S_{R}=0&lt;/math&gt; . Indeed, choosing again the Dirichlet boundary conditions of  &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{h}=1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;S_h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{h}=0&lt;/math&gt; on the other electrodes, from the equations for the open device we get the relationships

:&lt;math&gt;i_{h}=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}v_{j}\cdot F_h(r_{j})+\sum_{k=1}^{n}C_{hk}\frac{dV_h}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; ,

with

:&lt;math&gt;C_{hk}=-\int_{S_k}\varepsilon F_{h}\cdot dS&lt;/math&gt; ,

thus obtaining the Ramo-Shockly theorem as a particular application of the electrokinematics theorem, extended from the vacuum devices to any electrical component and material.

As the above relationships hold true also when &lt;math&gt;F(t)&lt;/math&gt; depends on time, we can have a sixty application if we select as &lt;math&gt;F=F_{V}=-\sum_{k=1}^{n}V_{k}(t)\nabla\psi_{k}(r)&lt;/math&gt; the electric field generated by the electrode voltages when there is no charge in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, as the first equation can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;-\int_{S}\Phi J\cdot dS=\int_{\Omega}J\cdot Fd^{3}r&lt;/math&gt; ,

from which we have

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{h=1}^{n}V_{h}i_{h}=\int_{\Omega}J\cdot F_{V}d^{3}r\equiv W&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the power entering the device &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; across the electrodes (enclosing it). On the other side

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Omega}(E\cdot J_{q}+E\cdot \frac{\varepsilon \partial E}{\partial t})d^{3}r=\int_{\Omega}E\cdot Jd^{3}r\equiv \frac{d\Xi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; ,

gives the increment of the internal energy &lt;math&gt;\Xi&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; in a unit of time, &lt;math&gt;E=F_{V}+E_{q}&lt;/math&gt; being the total electric field of which &lt;math&gt;F_{V}&lt;/math&gt; is due the electrodes and &lt;math&gt;E_{q}=-\nabla \psi_{q}(r,t)&lt;/math&gt; is due to the whole charge density in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\psi_{q}(r,t)=0&lt;/math&gt; over ''S''. Then it is &lt;math&gt;\int_{\Omega}E_{q}\cdot Jd^{3}r=0&lt;/math&gt;, so that, according to such equations, we also verify the energy balance &lt;math&gt;W=d\Xi/dt&lt;/math&gt; by means of the electrokinematics theorem. With the above relationships the balance can be extended also to the open devices by taking into account the displacement current across &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt;.

==Fluctuations==

A meaningful application of the above results is also the computation of the fluctuations of the current &lt;math&gt;i_{h}=i_{qh}&lt;/math&gt; when the electrode voltages is constant, because this is useful for the evaluation of the device [[Noise (electronics)|noise]]. To this end, we can exploit the first equation of section [[#Open devices|Open devices]], because it concerns the more general case of an open device and it can be reduced to a more simply relationship. This happens for frequencies &lt;math&gt;f=\omega/(2\pi)\ll1/(2\pi t_{j})&lt;/math&gt;, (&lt;math&gt;t_{j}&lt;/math&gt; being the transit time of the ''j''th carrier across the device) because the in time integral of the above equation of the [[Fourier transform]] to be performed to compute the [[Spectral density#Power spectral density|power spectral density]] (PSD) of the noise, the time derivatives provides no contribution. Indeed, according to the Fourier transform, this result derives from integrals such as &lt;math&gt; \int_{0}^{t_{j}}exp(-j\omega t)(\partial Q/\partial t)dt\approx Q(t_{j})-Q(0)&lt;/math&gt; , in which &lt;math&gt;Q(t_{j})=Q(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, for the PSD computation we can exploit the relationships

:&lt;math&gt;i_{qh}=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_jv_j\cdot F_h(r_j)=-\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}\frac{d\Phi_{h}[r_{j}(t)]}{dt}=\int_{\Omega}J_{q}\cdot Fd^{3}r&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, as it can be shown,&lt;ref name="note6"&gt;Pellegrini, B. (2013), "&lt;math&gt;1/f^{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; noise in graphene", The European Physical Journal B:373-385.&lt;/ref&gt; this happens also for &lt;math&gt;f\gg 1/(2\pi t_{j})&lt;/math&gt;, for instance when the ''j''th carrier is stored for a long time &lt;math&gt;\tau_{j}&lt;/math&gt; in a trap if the screening length due to the other carriers is small in comparison to ''&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;'' size. All the above considerations hold true for any size of ''&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;'', including nanodevices.
In particular we have a meaningful case when the device is a right parallelepiped or cylinder with &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; as lateral surface and ''u'' as the unit vector along its axis, with the bases &lt;math&gt;S_{E1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{E2}&lt;/math&gt; located at a distance ''L'' as electrodes, and with &lt;math&gt;S_{E1}\rightarrow u\rightarrow S_{E2}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, choosing &lt;math&gt;F_{h}=F=-u/L&lt;/math&gt;, from the above equation we finally obtain the current &lt;math&gt;i=i_{1}=i_{q1}=-i_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;i=\frac{1}{L}\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}v_{ju}=\frac{1}{L}\int_{\Omega}J_{qu}d^{3}r&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;v_{ju}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_{qu}&lt;/math&gt; are the components of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_{q}&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. The above equations in their corpuscular form are particularly suitable for the investigation of transport and noise phenomena from the microscopic point of view, with the application of both the analytical approaches and numerical statistical methods, such as the [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo techniques]]. On the other side, in their collective form of the last terms, they are useful to connect, with a general and new method, the local variations of continuous quantities to the current fluctuation at the device terminals. This will be shown in the next sections.

==Noise==

===Shot noise===
Let us first evaluate the PSD &lt;math&gt;S_S&lt;/math&gt; of the [[shot noise]] of the current &lt;math&gt;i=i_{qh}&lt;/math&gt; for short circuited device terminals, i.e. when the &lt;math&gt;V_{h}&lt;/math&gt;'s are constant, by applying the third member of the first equation of the above Section. To this end, let us exploit the [[Fourier coefficient]]

:&lt;math&gt;D(\omega_{l})\equiv\frac{1}{T^'}\int_{-T^'/2}^{T^'/2}\Delta i(t)\exp(-j\omega_{l}t)dt&lt;/math&gt;

and the relationship

:&lt;math&gt;S_{S}(\omega_{l})\equiv\lim_{\Delta f\to 0}\frac{\left \langle D(\omega_l)D^*(\omega_l)\right \rangle}{\Delta f}=\lim_{T^' \to \infty}(2T^'\left \langle D(\omega_l)D^*(\omega_l)\right \rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega_l=l(2\pi /T^')&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;l=...,-2,-1,1,2,...&lt;/math&gt; in the second term and &lt;math&gt;l=1,2,...&lt;/math&gt; in the third. If we define with &lt;math&gt;t_{bj}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(t_{bj}+t_j)&lt;/math&gt; the beginning and the end of the jth carrier motion inside &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, we have either &lt;math&gt;\Phi_h[r_j(t_{bj})]=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_h[r_j(t_{bj}+t_j)]=0&lt;/math&gt; or vice versa (the case of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_h[r_j(t_{bj})]=\Phi_h[r_j(t_{bj}+t_j)]&lt;/math&gt; give no contribution), so that from the first equations of the above and of this Section, we get

:&lt;math&gt;D(\omega_l)\equiv \frac{q}{T^'}(\Delta N^+-\Delta N^-)&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;N^+ (N^-)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of the carriers (with equal charge ''q'') that start from (arrive on) the electrode of interest during the time interval &lt;math&gt;-T^'/2, T^'/2&lt;/math&gt;. Finally for &lt;math&gt;\tau_c\ll t_{jmin}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; being the correlation time, and for carriers with a motion that is statistically independent and a [[Poisson process]] we have &lt;math&gt;\left\langle\Delta N^+\Delta N^-\right \rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left\langle\Delta N^+\Delta N^+\right\rangle=\left\langle N^+\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle\Delta N^-\Delta N^-\right\rangle=\left\langle N^-\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; so that we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;S_S=2q(I^++I^-)&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;I^+ (I^-)&lt;/math&gt; is the average current due to the carriers leaving (reaching) the electrode. Therefore, we recover and extend the [[Schottky's theorem]]&lt;ref name=note7&gt;Schottky, W. (1918). "Über spontane stromschwankungen in verschiedenen elektrizitätsleitern". Annalen der Physik 57: 541–567.&lt;/ref&gt; on shot noise. For instance for an ideal pn junction, or [[Schottky diode|Schottky barrier diode]], it is &lt;math&gt;I^+=I_0\exp(qv/k_BT)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I^-=I_0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant, ''T'' the absolute temperature, ''v'' the voltage and &lt;math&gt;I=I^+-I^-&lt;/math&gt; the total current. In particular, for &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt; the conductance becomes &lt;math&gt;g=(dI/dv)=qI_0/(k_BT)&lt;/math&gt; and the above equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;S_S=4k_BTg&lt;/math&gt; ,

that is the thermal noise at thermal equilibrium given by the [[Nyquist theorem]].&lt;ref name="note8"&gt;Nyquist,H. (1928). Thermal Agitation of Electric Charge in Conductors. Phys. Rev. 32: 110–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
If the carrier motions are correlated, the above equation has to be changed to the form (for &lt;math&gt;I^+\gg I^-&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;S_S=F_a(2qI)&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; is the so-called [[Fano factor]] that can be both less than 1 (for instance in the case of carrier generation-recombination in nonideal ''pn'' junctions&lt;ref&gt;Maione, I. A. Pellegrini, B., Fiori, G. Macucci, M. , Guidi, L. and Basso, G.(2011). Shot noise suppression in p-n junctions due to carrier generation-recombination. Phys. Rev. B 83, 155309 –155317.&lt;/ref&gt;), and greater than 1 (as in the negative resistance region of resonant-tunneling diode, as a result of the electron-electron interaction being enhanced by the particular shape of the density of states in the well.&lt;ref name=note2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iannaccone, G., Lombardi, G., Macucci, M. and Pellegrini B. (1998), Enhanced shot noise in resonant tunneling: theory and experiment.  Phys. Rev. Lett. 80: 1054-1058.&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Thermal noise===

Once again from the corpuscular point of view, let us evaluate the [[thermal noise]] with the autocorrelation function &lt;math&gt;\left \langle i(t)i(t+\theta)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt; by means of the second term of the second equation of section [[#Fluctuations|Fluctuations]], that for the short circuit condition &lt;math&gt;V_1=V_2=0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., at thermal equilibrium) which implies &lt;math&gt;N(t)=\overline{N}&lt;/math&gt;, becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle i(t)i(t+\theta)\right\rangle=\frac{q^2}{L^2}\sum_{j=1}^{\overline{N}}\left \langle v_{ju}^2(t)\right \rangle_t exp(-\left |\theta\right |/\tau_c)=\frac{q^2\overline{N}k_BT}{L^2m}\exp(-\left |\theta\right |/\tau_c)&lt;/math&gt; ,

where ''m'' is the carrier effective mass and &lt;math&gt;\tau_c\ll\tau_{jmin}&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;\mu=q\tau_c/[m(1+j\omega)]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G=q\mu\overline{N}/L^2&lt;/math&gt; are the carrier mobility and the conductance of the device, from the above equation and the [[Wiener-Khintchine theorem]]&lt;ref name=note12&gt;Wiener, N. (1930), "Generalized Harmonic Analysis", Acta mathematica:118-242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khintchine, A.(1934), "Korrelationstheorie der stationären stochastischen Prozesse", Mathematische Annalen 109: 604–615.&lt;/ref&gt; we recover the result

:&lt;math&gt;S_T=4k_BT\Re\{G(j\omega)\}&lt;/math&gt; ,

obtained by Nyquist from the [[Second law of thermodynamics|second principle of the thermodynamics]], i.e. by means of a macroscopic approach.&lt;ref name="note8" /&gt;

===Generation-recombination (g-r) noise===

A significant example of application of the macroscopic point of view expressed by the third term of the second equation of section [[#Fluctuations|Fluctuations]] is represented by the g-r noise generated by the carrier trapping-detrapping processes in device defects. In the case of constant voltages and drift current density &lt;math&gt;J_{qu}=q\mu n_qE, (E\equiv E_u)&lt;/math&gt;, that is by neglecting the above velocity fluctuations of thermal origin, from the mentioned equation we get

:&lt;math&gt;i=\frac{1}{L}\int_{\Omega}q\mu n_qEd^3r&lt;/math&gt; ,

in which &lt;math&gt;n_q&lt;/math&gt; is the carrier density, and its steady state value is &lt;math&gt;\overline{i}\equiv I=q\mu n_qEA&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; being the device cross-section surface; furthermore, we use the same symbols for both the time averaged and the instantaneous quantities. Let us first evaluate the fluctuations of the current ''i'', that from the above equation are

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta i}{I}=\frac{1}{\Omega}(\frac{1}{n_q}\int_{\Omega}\Delta n_qd^3r+\frac{1}{E}\int_{\Omega}\Delta Ed^3r+\frac{1}{\mu}\int_{\Omega}\Delta \mu d^3r)&lt;/math&gt; ,

where only the fluctuation terms are time dependent. The mobility fluctuations can be due to the motion or to the change of status of defects that we neglect here. Therefore, we ascribe the origin of g-r noise to the trapping-detrapping processes that contribute to &lt;math&gt;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt; through the other two terms via the fluctuation of the electron number &lt;math&gt;\chi=0,1&lt;/math&gt; in the energy level &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_t&lt;/math&gt; of a single trap in the channel or in its neighborhood. Indeed, the charge fluctuation &lt;math&gt;q\Delta\chi&lt;/math&gt; in the trap generates variations of &lt;math&gt;n_q&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. However, the variation &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; does not contribute to &lt;math&gt;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt; because it is odd in the ''u'' direction, so that we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta i}{I}=\frac{1}{\Omega n_q}\int_{\Omega}\Delta n_q d^3r&lt;/math&gt; ,

from which we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta i}{I}=\frac{1}{\Omega n_q}\int_{\delta\Omega}\Delta n_q ad^3r=-\frac{1}{\Omega n_q}\Delta\chi&lt;/math&gt; ,

where the reduction of the integration volume from &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; to the much smaller one &lt;math&gt;\delta\Omega&lt;/math&gt; around the defect is justified by the fact that the effects of &lt;math&gt;\Delta n_q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; fade within a few multiples of a screening length, which can be small (of the order of nanometers&lt;ref name=note7 /&gt; in [[graphene]]&lt;ref name=note12 /&gt;); from [[Gauss's theorem]], we obtain also &lt;math&gt;\int_{\delta\Omega}\Delta n_qd^3r=-\Delta\chi&lt;/math&gt; and the r.h.s. of the equation. In it the variation &lt;math&gt;\Delta\chi&lt;/math&gt; occurs around the average value &lt;math&gt;\overline{\chi}&lt;/math&gt; given by the Fermi-Dirac factor &lt;math&gt;\overline{\chi}\equiv\phi=\{[1+\exp[(\varepsilon_t-\varepsilon_f)/k_B T]\}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_f&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Fermi level]]. The PSD &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt; of the fluctuation &lt;math&gt;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt; due to a single trap then becomes &lt;math&gt;S_t/I^2=[1/(\Omega n_q)]^2S_{\chi}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S_{\chi}=4\phi(1-\phi)\tau/[1+(\omega\tau)^2]&lt;/math&gt; is the Lorentzian PSD of the random telegraph signal &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Machlup, S. (1954), "Noise in semiconductor: spectrum of two parameter random signal", J. Appl. Phys. 25: 341-343.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the trap relaxation time. Therefore, for a density &lt;math&gt;n_t&lt;/math&gt; of equal and uncorrelated defects we have a total PSD &lt;math&gt;S_{gr}&lt;/math&gt; of the g-r noise given by

:&lt;math&gt;S_{gr}=\frac{4I^2n_t\phi(1-\phi)\tau}{\Omega n^2_{q}[1+(\omega\tau)^2]}&lt;/math&gt; .

===Flicker noise===

When the defects are not equal, for any distribution of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; (except a sharply peaked one, as in the above case of g-r noise), and even for a very small number of traps with large &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;,  the total PSD &lt;math&gt;S_f&lt;/math&gt; of ''i'', corresponding to the sum of the PSD &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt; of all the &lt;math&gt;n_t\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (statistically independent) traps of the device, becomes&lt;ref&gt;Pellegrini, B. (2000), "A general model of &lt;math&gt;1/f^\gamma&lt;/math&gt; noise", Microelectronics Reliability 40: 1775-1780.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_f=\frac{n_tB}{\Omega n_q^2}\frac{I^2}{f^\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;0.85&lt;\gamma&lt;1.15&lt;/math&gt; down to the frequency &lt;math&gt;1/2\pi\tau_M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau_M&lt;/math&gt; being the largest &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(\varepsilon_f/k_B T)&lt;/math&gt; a proper coefficient. In particular, for unipolar conducting materials (e.g., for electrons as carriers) it can be &lt;math&gt;n_q\propto exp(\varepsilon_f/k_B T)&lt;/math&gt; and, for trap energy levels &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_t&gt;\varepsilon_f&lt;/math&gt;, from &lt;math&gt;S_{\chi}\propto \phi=exp(\varepsilon_f/k_B T)&lt;/math&gt; we also have &lt;math&gt;B(\varepsilon_f/k_B T)\propto exp(\varepsilon_f/k_B T)&lt;/math&gt;, so that from the above equation we obtain,&lt;ref name="note6" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_f=\frac{\alpha I^2}{N_qf^{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;N_q&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of the carriers and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a parameters that depends on the material, structure and technology of the device.

==Extensions==

===Electromagnetic field===

The shown electrokinetics theorem holds true in the 'quasi electrostatic' condition, that is when the vector potential can be neglected or, in other terms, when the squared maximum size of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than the squared minimum wavelength of the electromagnetic field in the device. However it can be extended to the electromagnetic field in a general form.&lt;ref name="note2" /&gt; In this general case, by means of the displacement current across the surface &lt;math&gt;S_R&lt;/math&gt; it is possible, for instance, to evaluate the electromagnetic field radiation from an antenna. It holds true also when the electric permittivity and the [[magnetic permeability]] depend on the frequency. Moreover, the field &lt;math&gt;F(r,t)=-\nabla\Phi&lt;/math&gt; other than the electric field in 'quasi electrostatic' conditions, can be any other physical irrotational field.

===Quantum mechanics===

Finally, the electrokinetics theorem holds true in the classical mechanics limit, because it requires the simultaneous knowledge of the position and velocity of the carrier, that is, as a result of the [[uncertainty principle]], when its wave function is essentially non null in a volume smaller than that of device. Such a limit can however be overcome computing the current density according to the quantum mechanical expression.&lt;ref name="note2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="note3" /&gt;

The '''[http://www.learningall.com/energy-crisis-in-pakistan/ energy policy of Pakistan]''' is formulated and determined by the federal, provincial, and local institutional entities in [[Pakistan]], which address the issues of energy production, distribution, and consumption of energy, such as gas mileage and petroleum standards.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Today"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=CCI approves National Energy Policy|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2013/08/01/news/national/cci-approves-national-energy-policy/|accessdate=30 August 2013|newspaper=Pakistan Today|date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Energy policy]] requires the proper legislation, international treaties, subsidies and incentives to investment, guidelines for [[energy conservation]], [[Taxation in Pakistan|taxation]] and other public policy techniques.

Several mandates and proposals have been called over the years to overlook the energy conservation, such as ''[[Neon signs]] were banned and the official weekend was extended from one to two days in an attempt to conserve electricity'' ([[Yousaf Raza Gillani|Gillani]], 2010)&lt;ref name=geotv /&gt; and ''reducing the electricity load used by [[Industry of Pakistan|industrial units]] by 25% during peak hours'' ([[Shaukat Aziz|Aziz]], 2007),&lt;ref name="AAJ News Archives"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Shaukat and Jatoi take up energy policy|url=http://www.aaj.tv/2007/05/shaukat-and-jatoi-take-up-energy-policy/|accessdate=30 August 2013|newspaper=AAJ News Archives|date=12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no comprehensive long-term energy strategies were implemented. Since 1999, many legislative provisions were adopted for [[energy conservation]] including the seeking energy from various [[Renewable energy in Pakistan|renewable energy sources]]. There is also an intense criticism about the unequal distribution of energy, the irresponsible usage of energy sources, and the country's new plan which is aimed to raise country's [[energy dependence|dependence]] on imported oil for power generation to 50% by 2030.&lt;ref name="The News International, 2008"&gt;{{cite news|last=Syed Mohibullah Shah |title=Energized yet powerless |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-71398-Energised-yet-powerless |accessdate=30 August 2013 |newspaper=The News International, 2008 |date=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616163600/http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-71398-Energised-yet-powerless |archivedate=16 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; After much public criticism, the long-term energy security policy was announced in 2013 through the introduction of equal cutting edge energy transmission network, minimising financial losses across the energy system and aligning the ministries involved in the energy sector as well as improving the governance of energy sources.&lt;ref name="Dawn News, 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhatti|first=Sohail|title=Ambitious' national energy policy formulated|url=http://dawn.com/news/1031108/ambitious-national-energy-policy-formulated|accessdate=30 August 2013|newspaper=Dawn News, 2013|date=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies and policy implementation recommended by [[Alternative Energy Development Board|AEDB]], [[Ministry of Water and Power (Pakistan)|Water ministry]] (as policy enforcer), the [[National Electric Power Regulatory Authority|NEPRA]] regulates the energy sources network as well as determining the financial prices of the usage of energy. Government-specific energy-efficiency incentive programs also play a significant role in the overall energy policy of Pakistan. As of 2013 Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] has announced a determined and aggressive energy policy to meet the energy challenges and energy management.&lt;ref name="Dawn News, 2013"/&gt;

==History==
In the 1960s, a large civilian energy input and infrastructure was built by the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistan military]], with the financial funds provided by various countries and international monetary sources.&lt;ref name="Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR)"&gt;{{cite web|last=ISPR|title=A Journey from Scratch to Nuclear Power|work=Govt. Pakistan, ISPR|publisher=Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR)|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, much of the energy was produced by the [[Dams in Pakistan|hydroelectric dams]] and [[Thermal power station|thermal]] power stations. In the 1970s, Pakistan's energy consumption expanded to [[nuclear power]] sources with the establishment and commissioning of [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant|first]] nuclear power station in Karachi. In the 1980s, the dependence on nuclear sources further grew and the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military]] continued engineering and building the nuclear power infrastructure.

In 1994, Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] of [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) launched the country's first ever and largest [[energy conservation]] program to produce 13,000[[Megawatt|MW]] and issues 70 Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) and Letters of Intent (LOIs) to Independent Power Producers (IPPs).&lt;ref name="Pakistan Today, August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aziz|first=Sartaj|title=Who is responsible?|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2013/04/23/comment/who-is-responsible-4/|accessdate=30 August 2013|newspaper=Pakistan Today, April 2013|date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 1994 energy policy brought a decisive shift in Pakistan's diverse energy sources.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Today, August 2013"/&gt; In 1994, out of the total installed capacity of 11000[[Megawatt|MW]], ~60% of energy was produced from the [[Dams in Pakistan|hydroelectric]] power sources while nearly ~40% was produced from the thermal and nuclear sources.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Today, August 2013"/&gt; According to the economic statistics provided by economist, [[Sartaj Aziz]], this mix was reversed from 60:40 to 30:70 in favour of thermal capacity based on imported fuel.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Today, August 2013"/&gt; Every year, this ratio went down further to 20:80 in winter months as hydropower generation was reduced due to lower water flows in the rivers.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Today, August 2013"/&gt;

Controversially, the energy policy depended less on renewable energy sources and dependence on imported oil increased that created a permanent fault in country's [[energy conservation]] system. By 1995, only 27 IPPs were able to generate ~6,335[[Megwatt|MW]] of electricity.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Today, August 2013"/&gt; By 1998, the ratio was stabilised by the policies enforced by Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]]. In 2001, the [[military government (disambiguation)|military government]] led by President [[Pervez Musharraf]] and Prime Minister [[Shaukat Aziz]], while contributing to the growth of domestic demand for electricity through large-scale provision of bank loans for the purchase of air-conditioners and home appliances (share of domestic energy consumption had jumped to 46% of the total by 2008), did not add any new capacity to the energy system.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Today, August 2013"/&gt; In 2012 Pakistan's first wind power installation came online at the [[Jhimpir Wind Energy Project (FFCEL)|FFCEL Wind Energy Project]] in Jhimpir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nation.com.pk/business/09-Nov-2012/50mw-wind-power-project-connected-to-national-grid|title=50MW wind power project connected to national grid|author=|date=|website=nation.com.pk|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy overview==

===Energy policy: 2008–10===

In 2005, Prime Minister [[Shaukat Aziz]] announced the long-term [[energy security]] program which was aimed to the development of the power infrastructure from all energy sources.&lt;ref name="The HIndu"&gt;{{cite news|last=Muralidhar Reddy|title=We will oppose domination of Indian Ocean: Shaukat Aziz|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/03/09/stories/2005030913361200.htm|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=The HIndu|date=8 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy relied on [[Privatization in Pakistan|privatising]] the energy sector by international mega energy corporations.&lt;ref name="The News International, 2011"/&gt; Controversially, this program was aimed to raise dependence on imported oil from the [[Arab countries]] for power generation to be increased by 50.1% by 2013.&lt;ref name="The News International, 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Syed Mohibullah Shah|title=Energised, yet powerless|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=71398&amp;Cat=9|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=The News International, 2011|date=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Prime Minister [[Shaukat Aziz|Aziz]] held conversation with the officials of the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] [[Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources of Saudi Arabia|Ministry of Petroleum]] and invited [[Ali Al-Naimi]] to invest in country's energy sector.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News, area studies"&gt;{{cite news|last=APP|title=Saudi investment invited in energy, mining sectors|url=http://dawn.com/news/217936/saudi-investment-invited-in-energy-mining-sectors|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=The Dawn News, areastudies|date=7 November 2006&lt;!-- 00:00:00--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Prime Minister [[Shaukat Aziz|Aziz]] allocated [[Pakistan Rupee|₨.]] 12.5&amp;nbsp;billion for power production-related projects which remained unused. In his last policy statement, Prime Minister [[Shaukat Aziz|Aziz]] further called for banning the [[Neon lighting|Neon lights]], [[Neon sign]]s, and to close the market places by 9&amp;nbsp;pm; such policy enforcement was harshly resisted by the left-wing parties, such as [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], [[Pakistan Communist Party|Communist Party]] and the [[Pakistan Labour Federation|labour unions]].&lt;ref name="Labour Unity Org."&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff |title=Traders agree to close markets at 9&amp;nbsp;pm |url=https://www.labourunity.org/localnews.php?stpt=2331 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131020214656/http://www.labourunity.org/localnews.php?stpt=2331 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 October 2013 |work=Labour Unity Org. |publisher=Labour Unity Org. |accessdate=18 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy Policy: 2010–13===

After the [[Pakistani general election, 2008|general elections]] held in 2008, the mismanagement and weak policies led to an intense repetitive cycle of [[loadshedding]] in the country. Responding to a massive demonstration against the [[loadshedding]] and the growing power shortages in the country, Prime Minister, [[Yousaf Raza Gillani|Yousaf Gilani]] announced the "energy policy" on 22 April 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8637454.stm|title= Pakistan's PM announces energy policy to tackle crisis|date=22 April 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy was announced after the Prime Minister, [[Yousaf Raza Gillani|Gilani]] had held a three-day national energy conference in [[Islamabad]] with energy experts that discussed the causes of the power crisis in [[Pakistan]] and possible steps to relieve it.&lt;ref name="geotv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.geo.tv/4-22-2010/63613.htm|title=Steps taken to tackle energy crisis|date=22 April 2010|publisher=[[Geo TV]]|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an immediate effects, the gaseous [[Neon lighting|Neon light]]s and the [[Neon sign|signs]] were banned and the official weekend was extended from one to two days in an attempt to conserve electricity.&lt;ref name="nyt04262010"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/world/asia/27lahore.html|title=Pakistanis Living on Brink, and Often in the Dark|date=26 April 2010|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=28 April 2010 | first=Sabrina | last=Tavernise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this policy, several attempts were made by [[Yousaf Raza Gillani|Gilani government]] to [[Privatization in Pakistan|privatise]] the energy sector.&lt;ref name="Prime Minister's Inspection Commission"&gt;{{cite web|last1=et. al.|first1=PD|title=Effects of Power Sector Reforms|url=http://pmic.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1706&amp;Itemid=612|publisher=Prime Minister's Inspection Commission|accessdate=3 July 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devised by the Finance Minister [[Abdul Hafeez Shaikh]], the programme failed to resolve electricity shortage, which private energy companies failed to maintain and upgrade despite being part of their contract.&lt;ref name="Prime Minister's Inspection Commission"/&gt; After much criticism and public demonstration in 2012, the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] government decided to [[Nationalization in Pakistan|nationalised]] the energy sector and issued clear directives to regulate the energy corporations to produce the power generations.&lt;ref name="Nationalization and Privatization in Pakistan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amin |first1=Mohd.

===Energy Policy: 2013–18===
[[Musadik Masood Malik]] was appointed Federal Minister, Water and Power of the Pakistan Government in May, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-2-183890-A-caretaker-minister-makes-his-way-into-real-cabinet |title=A caretaker minister makes his way into real cabinet |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date= |accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two months, he was replaced by [[Abid Sher Ali]] who served in the role until the ministry was abolished in September, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/580476/pml-ns-abid-sher-ali-appointed-as-new-state-minister-for-power/|title=PML-N's Abid Sher Ali appointed as new state minister for power|last=|first=|date=22 July 2013|website=The Express Tribune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place a [[Ministry of Energy (Pakistan)|Ministry of Energy]] was created. [[Awais Leghari]] served as the first energy minister of the country until the end of the government's tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fp.brecorder.com/2017/10/20171005223572/|title=Awais Leghari made Minister of Power Division|last=|first=|date=6 October 2017|website=Business Recorder|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 amendment to Pakistan’s Constitution (para. 3), empowered each province to formulate the policy framework for the development of public and private sector power generation. This has led to the formation of dedicated provincial departments and empowered public sector companies specialized in renewables to foster and execute power projects through public, private and public–private partnership modes using indigenous power resources.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Development Bank, Access to Clean Energy Investment Program: Summary Sector Assessment: Energy, p.2 &lt;/ref&gt;

This tenure's energy policy was aimed at aggressively building power generation capacity through early-harvest projects in [[CPEC]]. A total of 10,973 MW of power was added by the government during its tenure, mostly via private sector investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/04/12/10973mw-electricity-added-to-national-grid-by-present-govt-na-told/|title=PML-N govt added 10,973MW electricity to system, NA told|website=Pakistan Today|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of public sector projects conducted by provincial governments in view of the 2010 amendment, KPK government led with the addition of 1,670 MW to the national grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1668360/1-pti-claims-govt-added-1670mw-power-grid/|title=PTI claims govt only added 1,670MW to the power grid - The Express Tribune|date=2018-03-24|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by Sindh and Punjab governments which contributed 935 MW and 580 MW respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/04/23/sindh-contributes-935-mw-wind-energy-in-national-grid-cm/|title=Sindh contributes 935 MW wind energy in national grid: CM|website=Pakistan Today|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energy.punjab.gov.pk/_pages/initiatives.html|title=[Initiatives] Energy Department, Govt. of the Punjab, Pakistan|website=www.energy.punjab.gov.pk|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balochistan government didn't inaugurate any public sector power project during its tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/182491-No-energy-in-Balochistan|title=No energy for Balochistan|last=Baloch|first=Sanaullah|date=29 January 2018|website=The News International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the massive addition of power to the national grid, glaring issues existed in the power sector. There was no viable overhaul done to the electricity transport infrastructure which lead to episodes of plant tripping and extended blackouts during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1408040|title=Parts of Punjab, KP hit by massive power breakdown|date=2018-05-16|work=Dawn|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there was still a wide demand and supply gap during high temperature months which led to periodic, planned load-shedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605085134/http://roshanpakistan.pk/pp/|title=Daily Power Position|date=2018-06-04|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the issue of ''circular debt'' was still attached to the power sector and reached a record high of Rs. 922 billion in March, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1392681|title=Energy sector circular debt touches record Rs922bn|last=Kiani|first=Khaleeq|date=2018-03-02|work=Dawn|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation and consumption==

Due to rising demand and a failing power infrastructure severe electricity shortages have occurred in Pakistan. This has led to widespread [[rolling blackout]]s that have paralysed industry and led to protests and rioting.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt; [[Power outage]]s can last 6–8 hours a day in the cities and many more in the rural areas.&lt;ref name="KT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/international/2010/April/international_April1237.xml&amp;section=international|title=Pakistan turns off lights to end energy crisis|date=22 April 2010|work=[[Khaleej Times]]|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mahnaz Parach of Network for Consumer Protection "Children can't do their homework. Housework doesn't get done, as washing machines and other appliances cannot work. When you go home from work, you have no idea whether there will be electricity at home. Your whole life is disturbed."&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/21/pakistan-energy-shortages-wedding-curfew|title=Pakistan to impose wedding curfew as power shortages cause civil unrest|date=21 April 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 April 2010 | location=London | first=Saeed | last=Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition there is widespread power theft and lack of investment in the existing power grid.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKSGE63L08920100422|title=Crisis talks as power shortages hit Pakistan industry|date=22 April 2010|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to the decision to curtail power supply to Karachi, the "City of Lights", leaders of various political parties in the [[Provincial Assembly of Sindh]] condemned the decision and some of them called it "a conspiracy to create a law and order situation."  Former [[Nazim of Karachi]], [[Naimatullah Khan]] warned that curtailing the power supply of the city could lead to street battles between protesters and law enforcement.&lt;ref name="dawn04232010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/local/karachi/karachi-lights-being-turned-off-to-overcome-energy-crisis-340|title=Karachi lights being turned off to overcome energy crisis|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing energy crisis in Pakistan is taking away 2 percent (or Rs 380&amp;nbsp;billion) of the economy, despite the government has spent Rs 1.1&amp;nbsp;trillion as subsidies on the sector in the last four-year which accounts for 2.5 percent of the total volume of economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-3-111611-Economic-cost-of-energy-crisis-estimated-at-Rs380bn Economic cost of energy crisis estimated at Rs380bn], The News, 1 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

During June 2012, President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] had said that the government realised the enormity of the challenge of energy shortage and was determined to overcome it in the shortest possible time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=52017 Disengagement not an option: President Zardari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602052044/http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=52017 |date=2 June 2012 }}, Geo News, 1 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==International co-operation==
Pakistan is already importing small quantity of electricity from [[Iran]] to supply power to [[Gwadar]] town. Pakistan is also actively considering to import electricity from [[India]] and [[Tajikistan]]. [[World Bank]] offered to finance for conducting the feasibility study to import 1200 MW power from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wrmin.nic.in/writereaddata/Inter-StateWaterDisputes/KWDTReport9718468760.pdf|title= Pakistan all set to import electricity from India |year=2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/adani-mulls-exporting-electricity-to-pakistan/|title= Adani mulls exporting electricity to Pakistan |year=2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan is also exploring to import [[Piped natural gas|PNG]] via pipe line through [[Wagha]] border from India. India would import the required [[LNG]] and re-gasified LNG (RLNG) would be pumped through its pipelines up to the border point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wrmin.nic.in/writereaddata/Inter-StateWaterDisputes/KWDTReport9718468760.pdf|title= India, Pakistan may shake hands on electricity, hydrocarbons|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran–Pakistan gas pipeline]] is pending for a long time to receive PNG from Iran for the needs of both Pakistan and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indiapakistaniran-pipeline-remains-the-most-viable-option/article5754288.ece|title= India-Pakistan-Iran pipeline remains the most viable option |year=2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4194">'''Enhanced coal bed methane recovery''' is a method of producing additional [[coalbed methane]] from a [[source rock]], similar to [[enhanced oil recovery]] applied to [[oil field]]s.  [[Carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) injected into a [[bituminous coal]] bed would occupy pore space and also [[adsorb]] onto the [[carbon]] in the coal at approximately twice
the rate of [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), allowing for potential enhanced gas recovery.&lt;ref name=Wickstrom&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Portals/10/pdf/BurgerReport.pdf |title=Geologic Assessment of the Burger Power Plant and Surrounding Vicinity for Potential Injection of Carbon Dioxide |first=Lawrence H. |last=Wickstrom |author2=Ernie R.

A research project at [[ETH Zurich]] is studying the process of pumping carbon dioxide into unminable coal seams and recovering the methane that is subsequently displaced. 

An extensive experimental investigation about the process of desorbing methane by adsorbing carbon dioxide in real coal samples was performed. The proof of principle and the technical feasibility of the method could be verified with these measurements. These research results indicate that CBM can become an alternative to conventional natural gas. ECBM provides additional to CBM the advantage of long-term CO2 storage in the underground coal seams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubotherm.com/investigation-of-enhanced-coal-bed-methane-ecbm-processes.html ''Investigation of Enhanced Coal Bed Methane (ECBM) Processes - Gravimetric Adsorption Measurements under Realistic Conditions''] &lt;/ref&gt;

However, without other incentives, enhanced coal bed methane recovery is not economical as the commercial value of the released methane does not completely offset the cost of pumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipe.ethz.ch/laboratories/spl/research/adsorption/project03 |title=ETH - SPL - Enhanced coal bed methane recovery |date=2006-08-31 |publisher=[[ETH Zurich]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706232006/http://www.ipe.ethz.ch/laboratories/spl/research/adsorption/project03 |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests''' [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]], in the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] [[Biome]], is located along the southern shore of the [[Black Sea]]. The ecoregion extends along the thin coastal strip from the southeastern corner of [[Bulgaria]] in the west, to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the east, across the northern coast of [[Turkey]], where it wraps around the eastern end of the Black Sea.

==Sub-regions==
The ecoregion is divided into two sub-regions, chiefly based on the amount of precipitation.

The understory of evergreen mesomorphic broadleaf shrubs is characteristic for both sub-regions. Notable species in the understory include various rhododendrons such as Pontic rhododendron (''[[Rhododendron ponticum]]''); Black Sea holly (''[[Ilex colchica]]''), cherry laurel (''[[Laurocerasus officinalis]]''), Caucasus (''[[Buxus colchica]]'') and common box (''[[Buxus sempervirens]]''), Caucasian whortleberry (''[[Vaccinium arctostaphylos]]''), etc. From a European perspective, the majority of these count as [[relict species]] from the [[Tertiary]] period.

===Colchian forests===
The '''Colchic''' or '''Colchian forests''' are found around the southeast corner of the Black Sea in Turkey and Georgia in [[Machakhela National Park]] and area around it. The Colchian forests are mixed, with deciduous [[Alnus glutinosa|Black Alder]] ''(Alnus glutinosa)'', hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]'' and ''[[Carpinus orientalis|C. orientalis]]''), [[Oriental Beech]] (''Fagus orientalis''), and [[Sweet Chestnut]] ''(Castanea sativa)'', together with evergreen [[Nordmann Fir]] (''Abies nordmanniana'', the tallest tree in Europe at 78m), [[Caucasian Spruce]] (''Picea orientalis'') and [[Scots Pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris''). The Colchic region has high rainfall, averaging 1,500-2,500&amp;nbsp;mm annually, with a maximum in excess of 4,000&amp;nbsp;mm, and is home to some of Europe's [[temperate rain forests]].

===Euxinic forests===
The drier '''Euxine''' or '''Euxinic forests''' lie west of the [[Melet River]], and extend across the [[Bosporus]] along the Black Sea coast of European Turkey to Bulgaria. The Euxine forests receive an average of 1,000 to 1,500&amp;nbsp;mm precipitation annually. The Bulgarian part of the ecoregion lies within [[Strandzha Nature Park]], where it borders on and transitions into the [[Balkan mixed forests]] ecoregion.

Rare habitat types include [[dune|coastal sand dunes]] and [[peatland]]s.

Techniques include [[Lumber|timber]] extraction, [[Afforestation|planting]] and [[Reforestation|replanting]] of various [[Tree|species]], cutting roads and pathways through forests, and preventing [[Wildfire|fire]].

==Definition==

The forest is a natural system that can supply different products and services. The working of this system is influenced by the natural environment: climate, topography, soil, etc., and also by human activity. The actions of humans in forests constitute forest management.{{cn|date=May 2016}} In developed societies, this management tends to be elaborate and planned in order to achieve the objectives that are considered desirable.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

Some forests have been and are managed to obtain traditional forest products such as firewood, fiber for paper, and timber, with little thinking for other products and services. Nevertheless, as a result of the progression of environmental awareness, management of forests for multiple use is becoming more common.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Raymond |title=Introduction to Forest Science |date=1982 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; sons |isbn=978-0471064381|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public input and awareness==
There has been increased public awareness of natural resource policy, including forest management.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Public concern regarding forest management may have shifted from the extraction of timber for earning money for the economy, to the preservation of additional forest [[natural resources|resources]], including [[wildlife]] and [[old growth forest]], protecting [[biodiversity]], [[drainage basin|watershed]] management, and [[recreation]]. Increased environmental awareness may contribute to an increased public mistrust of forest management professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shindler |first=Bruce |authorlink= |author2=Lori A. Cramer |date= January 1999 |title=Shifting Public Values for Forest Management: Making Sense of Wicked Problems |journal=Western Journal of Applied Forestry |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=28–34 |issn=0885-6095 |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/eco/eco-watch/wickedpr.html |language= |accessdate=2008-08-25 |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But it can also lead to greater understanding about what professionals do for forests for nature conservation and ecological services. The importance of taking care of the forests for ecological as well as economical sustainable reasons has been shown in the TV show [[Ax Men]].

Many tools like [[GIS]] and [[photogrammetry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/599104.BALENOVIC_ET_AL_-_COMPARISON_OF_CLASSICAL_TERRESTRIALPDF I. Balenovich, A. Seletkovich, et al.

'''1''' (2) ]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1953, the volume of standing trees in the United States have increased by 90% due to sustainable forest management.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.contractorstoday.com/the-value-of-hardwood-floors The Value of Hardwood Floors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife considerations==
The abundance and diversity of birds, mammals, amphibians and other wildlife are affected by strategies and types of forest management.&lt;ref&gt;* Philip Joseph Burton. 2003. ''Towards sustainable management of the boreal forest'' 1039 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management intensity==

Forest management varies in intensity from a leave alone, natural situation to a highly intensive regime with silvicultural interventions. Forest Management is generally increased in intensity to achieve either economic criteria (increased timber yields, [[non-timber forest product]]s, [[ecosystem services]]) or ecological criteria (species recovery, fostering of rare species, carbon sequestration).&lt;ref&gt;Classification of Forest Management Approaches: A New Conceptual Framework and Its Applicability to European Forestry

The '''globe effect''', sometimes called the '''rolling ball effect''' or the '''spinning globe effect''', is an [[optics|optical]] phenomenon that occurs with visual [[optical instrument]]s, in particular [[binoculars]] and [[optical telescope|telescopes]], that are designed to be free of [[distortion (optics)|distortion]]. When these instruments are panned, the moving image appears to roll over a curved, convex surface. In 1949, Horst Koehler at [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss (Jena)]] suggested adding some [[pincushion distortion]] to the optical design to eliminate the globe effect.&lt;ref name="koehler"&gt;H. Koehler, "Grundsaetzliches zum Fernrohrsehen", ''Deutsche Optische Wochenschrift'' '''35''', Vol. 6, p. 41 (1949).&lt;/ref&gt; August Sonnefeld conducted experiments with volunteers, which supported the claim that a supplementary distortion could improve the imaging of visual optical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;A. Sonnefeld, "Ueber die Verzeichnung bei optischen Instrumenten, die in Verbindung mit dem blickenden Auge gebraucht werden", ''Deutsche Optische Wochenschrift'' '''35''', Vol. 13, p. 97 (1949).&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, most binocular manufacturers have followed Zeiss's example and added pincushion distortion to their [[optical design]].

The origin of the globe effect initially remained unclear after its discovery in the first half of the past century.&lt;ref name = "koehler" /&gt; Koehler speculated about an "unnatural [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] generated by the binocular while panning over a three dimensional scenery", thereby ignoring the fact that the globe effect was observable at the night sky as well, where perspective distortions were absent.

Recently, the globe effect has been linked to the peculiar properties of human [[visual perception]],&lt;ref&gt;H. Merlitz, "Distortion of binoculars revisited: Does the sweet spot exist?", ''JOSA A'', Vol. '''27''', Issue 1, pp. 50-57 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; which adds a certain amount of [[barrel distortion]] to the [[visual field]].&lt;ref&gt;A.H.J. Oomes, J.J. Koenderink, A.J. Doorn, H. de Ridder, "What are the uncurved lines in our visual field? A fresh look at
Helmholtz's checkerboard", ''Perception'' '''38''', p. 1284 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of barrel distortion is subject to individual differences, which explains the fact that the perceived intensity of the globe effect varies significantly between different observers.

An alternative approach&lt;ref&gt;Erklärung des Globuseffekts, Walter E. Schön, http://www.juelich-bonn.com/jForum/read.php?9,288850,288850#msg-288850&lt;/ref&gt; for explaining the globe effect comes from the technical journalist  and optics specialist Walter E. Schön. He states that the observed effect is in fact not that of a rolling globe but that of a vertically rotating cylinder. The globe shape of the illusion seen by most observers is only because the field of view through the optical device is circular. This illusion of a rotating cylinder during panning is caused by the horizontal movement of the image being (due to the angular magnification of the device) faster and more uniform (with less parallax) compared to the naked eye and also not corresponding to the felt rotational speed of the observer's head. When the brain tries to integrate these conflicting signals, it creates the perception that the image is moving slower at the left and right edges than in the middle, giving the illusion of a rotating cylinder.

{{lang|de|'''Heiligenschein'''}} ([[German language|German]] for "[[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]" or "[[aureola]]", {{IPA-de|ˈhaɪlɪɡənˌʃaɪn|pron}}) is an [[optical phenomenon]] in which a bright spot appears around the shadow of the viewer's head. In [[photogrammetry]] and [[remote sensing]], it is more commonly known as the '''hotspot'''.

This [[diffuse reflection]] is due to the [[opposition surge]], the reduction in the proportion of shadows viewed at angles close to the [[backscatter]] direction. It may also be created when the surface on which the shadow falls has [[retroreflective]] optical properties. Both dry [[regolith]] and [[dew]]y grass are known to exhibit these characteristics. Nearly spherical dew droplets act as [[lens (optics)|lens]]es to focus the light onto the surface behind them. When this light [[light scattering|scatters]] or reflects off that surface, the same lens re-focuses that light into the direction from which it came. This configuration is sometimes called a [[cat's eye retroreflector]]. Any retroreflective surface is brightest around the [[antisolar point]].

A '''high-frequency approximation''' (or "high energy approximation") for [[scattering]] or other [[wave]] propagation problems, in [[physics]] or [[engineering]], is an approximation whose accuracy increases with the size of features on the scatterer or medium relative to the wavelength of the scattered particles.

[[Classical mechanics]] and [[geometric optics]] are the most common and extreme high frequency approximation, where the wave or field properties of, respectively, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism]] are neglected entirely.

Less extreme approximations include, the [[WKB approximation]], [[physical optics]], the [[geometric theory of diffraction]], the [[uniform theory of diffraction]], and the [[physical theory of diffraction]]. When these are used to approximate [[quantum mechanics]], they are called semiclassical approximations.

The [[Solar System]] and all of the visible stars are in different orbits about the core of the [[Milky Way galaxy]].  Thus, their relative positions change over time, and for the nearer stars this movement can be measured.  As a [[star]] moves toward or away from us, its [[apparent magnitude|apparent brightness]] changes.  [[Sirius]] is currently the brightest star in Earth's night sky, but it has not always been so.  [[Canopus]] has persistently been the brightest star over the ages; other stars appear brighter only during relatively temporary periods, during which they are passing the Solar System at a much closer distance than Canopus.

Working out exactly which stars were or will be the brightest at any given point in the past or future is difficult since it requires precise 3D proper motions of large numbers of stars and precise distances.&lt;ref name=tomkin /&gt; This information only started to become available with the 1997 [[Hipparcos]] data release.&lt;ref name=tomkin /&gt; Jocelyn Tomkin used this data to compile a list of brightest star in Earth's night sky at each period within the last or next 5 million years.&lt;ref name=tomkin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomkin|first=Jocelyn|date=April 1998|title=Once and Future Celestial Kings|journal=Sky and Telescope|volume=95|issue=4|pages=59–63|bibcode=1998S&amp;T....95d..59T}} - based on computations from [[HIPPARCOS]] data.

For example it doesn't include [[Gliese 710]] which in about 1.35 million years time is expected to be close enough to have a magnitude of -2.7.&lt;ref name="Berski2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berski|first=Filip|last2=Dybczyński|first2=Piotr A.|date=2016-11-01|title=Gliese 710 will pass the Sun even closer|url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2016/11/aa29835-16/aa29835-16.html|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|language=en|volume=595|pages=L10|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201629835|issn=0004-6361|bibcode = 2016A&amp;A...595L..10B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ice age''' is a long period of reduction in the temperature of the [[Earth]]'s surface and atmosphere, resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar [[ice sheet]]s and alpine [[glacier]]s. Within a long-term ice age, individual pulses of cold climate are termed "[[glacial period]]s" (or, alternatively, "glacials" or "glaciations", or colloquially "ice ages"), and intermittent warm periods are called "[[interglacial]]s". 

In the terminology of [[glaciology]], ''ice age'' implies the presence of extensive ice sheets in both northern and southern hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Imbrie, J. |author2=Imbrie, K.P |title=Ice ages: solving the mystery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aboTAQAAIAAJ |year=1979 |publisher=Enslow Publishers |isbn=978-0-89490-015-0 |location=Short Hills NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition, we are in an interglacial period—the [[Holocene]]—of the current ice age. 

The current ice age began 2.6 million years ago at the start of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, and the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]], [[Arctic]], and [[Antarctic ice sheet]]s still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gribbin, J.R. |title=Future Weather: Carbon Dioxide, Climate and the Greenhouse Effect |publisher=Penguin |year=1982 |isbn=0-14-022459-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of ice age theory==

In 1742, Pierre Martel (1706–1767), an engineer and geographer living in [[Geneva]], visited the valley of [[Chamonix]] in the [[Alps]] of [[Savoy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rémy F, Testut L |title=Mais comment s'écoule donc un glacier ?

He reported that the inhabitants of that valley attributed the dispersal of [[glacial erratic|erratic boulder]]s to the glaciers, saying that they had once extended much farther.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martel, Pierre |chapter=Appendix: Martel, P.

In 1815 the carpenter and [[chamois]] hunter Jean-Pierre Perraudin (1767–1858) explained erratic boulders in the Val de Bagnes in the Swiss canton of Valais as being due to glaciers previously extending further.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=78–83}}
&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown woodcutter from Meiringen in the Bernese Oberland advocated a similar idea in a discussion with the Swiss-German geologist [[Jean de Charpentier]] (1786–1855) in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable explanations are also known from the Val de Ferret in the Valais and the Seeland in western Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=83, 151}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s [[Goethean science|scientific work]].&lt;ref&gt;Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von: Geologische Probleme und Versuch ihrer Auflösung, Mineralogie und Geologie in Goethes Werke, Weimar 1892, {{ISBN|3-423-05946-X}}, book 73 (WA II,9), p. 253, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Such explanations could also be found in other parts of the world. When the Bavarian naturalist [[Ernst von Bibra]] (1806–1878) visited the Chilean Andes in 1849–1850, the natives attributed fossil [[moraine]]s to the former action of glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, European scholars had begun to wonder what had caused the dispersal of erratic material. From the middle of the 18th century, some discussed ice as a means of transport. The Swedish mining expert Daniel Tilas (1712–1772) was, in 1742, the first person to suggest drifting sea ice in order to explain the presence of erratic boulders in the Scandinavian and Baltic regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1795, the Scottish philosopher and gentleman naturalist, [[James Hutton]] (1726–1797), explained erratic boulders in the Alps by the action of glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=61–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two decades later, in 1818, the Swedish botanist [[Göran Wahlenberg]] (1780–1851) published his theory of a glaciation of the Scandinavian peninsula. He regarded glaciation as a regional phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=88–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[File:AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. Ice sheets expand during an ice age.]]

Only a few years later, the Danish-Norwegian geologist [[Jens Esmark]] (1762–1839) argued a sequence of worldwide ice ages. In a paper published in 1824, Esmark proposed changes in climate as the cause of those glaciations. He attempted to show that they originated from changes in Earth's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=91–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years, Esmark's ideas were discussed and taken over in parts by Swedish, Scottish and German scientists. At the University of Edinburgh [[Robert Jameson]] (1774–1854) seemed to be relatively open to Esmark's ideas, as reviewed by Norwegian professor of glaciology [[Bjørn G. Andersen]] (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bjørn G. |last=Andersen |year=1992 |title=[[Jens Esmark]]—a pioneer in glacial geology |journal=[[Boreas (journal)|Boreas]] |volume=21 |pages=97–102 |doi=10.1111/j.1502-3885.1992.tb00016.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson's remarks about ancient glaciers in Scotland were most probably prompted by Esmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Davies, Gordon L. |title=The Earth in Decay.

Pioneer Scottish Glaciologist |publisher=Scottish Academic Press |location=Edinburgh |year=1990 |isbn=0-7073-0320-6 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, Albrecht Reinhard Bernhardi (1797–1849), a geologist and professor of forestry at an academy in Dreissigacker, since incorporated in the southern [[Thuringia]]n city of [[Meiningen]], adopted Esmark's theory. In a paper published in 1832, Bernhardi speculated about former polar ice caps reaching as far as the temperate zones of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=142–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1829, independently of these debates, the Swiss civil engineer [[Ignaz Venetz]] (1788–1859) explained the dispersal of erratic boulders in the Alps, the nearby Jura Mountains, and the North German Plain as being due to huge glaciers. When he read his paper before the [[Academy of Natural Sciences Switzerland|Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft]], most scientists remained sceptical.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=104–05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Venetz convinced his friend Jean de Charpentier. De Charpentier transformed Venetz's idea into a theory with a glaciation limited to the Alps. His thoughts resembled Wahlenberg's theory. In fact, both men shared the same volcanistic, or in de Charpentier's case rather [[plutonism|plutonistic]] assumptions, about the Earth's history. In 1834, de Charpentier presented his paper before the Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=150–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the German botanist [[Karl Friedrich Schimper]] (1803–1867) was studying mosses which were growing on erratic boulders in the alpine upland of Bavaria. He began to wonder where such masses of stone had come from. During the summer of 1835 he made some excursions to the Bavarian Alps. Schimper came to the conclusion that ice must have been the means of transport for the boulders in the alpine upland. In the winter of 1835 to 1836 he held some lectures in Munich. Schimper then assumed that there must have been global times of obliteration ("Verödungszeiten") with a cold climate and frozen water.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=155–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schimper spent the summer months of 1836 at Devens, near Bex, in the Swiss Alps with his former university friend [[Louis Agassiz]] (1801–1873) and Jean de Charpentier. Schimper, de Charpentier and possibly Venetz convinced Agassiz that there had been a time of glaciation. During the winter of 1836/37, Agassiz and Schimper developed the theory of a sequence of glaciations. They mainly drew upon the preceding works of Venetz, de Charpentier and on their own fieldwork. Agassiz appears to have been already familiar with Bernhardi's paper at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=167–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1837, Schimper coined the term "ice age" (''"Eiszeit"'') for the period of the glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1837 Agassiz presented their synthesis before the annual meeting of the Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft at Neuchâtel. The audience was very critical and some opposed to the new theory because it contradicted the established opinions on climatic history. Most contemporary scientists thought that the Earth had been gradually cooling down since its birth as a molten globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2008|pp=177–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to overcome this rejection, Agassiz embarked on geological fieldwork. He published his book ''Study on Glaciers'' ("Études sur les glaciers") in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Louis |last1=Agassiz |authorlink=Louis Agassiz |first2=Joseph |last2=Bettannier |title=Études sur les glaciers.

Nicolet}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Charpentier was put out by this, as he had also been preparing a book about the glaciation of the Alps. De Charpentier felt that Agassiz should have given him precedence as it was he who had introduced Agassiz to in-depth glacial research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2008|pp=223–4. De Charpentier, Jean: ''Essais sur les glaciers et sur le terrain erratique du bassin du Rhône,'' Lausanne 1841.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides that, Agassiz had, as a result of personal quarrels, omitted any mention of Schimper in his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=181–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All together, it took several decades until the ice age theory was fully accepted by scientists. This happened on an international scale in the second half of the 1870s following the work of [[James Croll]], including the publication of ''Climate and Time, in Their Geological Relations'' in 1875, which provided a credible explanation for the causes of ice ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krüger|2013|pp=458–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence for ice ages==
There are three main types of evidence for ice ages: geological, chemical, and paleontological.

'''Geological''' evidence for ice ages comes in various forms, including rock scouring and scratching, [[glacial moraine]]s, [[drumlin]]s, valley cutting, and the deposition of [[till]] or tillites and [[glacial erratic]]s. Successive glaciations tend to distort and erase the geological evidence, making it difficult to interpret. Furthermore, this evidence was difficult to date exactly; early theories assumed that the glacials were short compared to the long interglacials. The advent of sediment and ice cores revealed the true situation: glacials are long, interglacials short. It took some time for the current theory to be worked out.

The '''chemical''' evidence mainly consists of variations in the ratios of [[isotope]]s in fossils present in sediments and sedimentary rocks and ocean sediment cores. For the most recent glacial periods [[ice core]]s provide climate [[Proxy (climate)|proxies]] from their ice, and atmospheric samples from included bubbles of air. Because water containing heavier isotopes has a higher [[heat of evaporation]], its proportion decreases with colder conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=How are past temperatures determined from an ice core? |journal=Scientific American |date=2004-09-20 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-are-past-temperatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows a temperature record to be constructed. This evidence can be confounded, however, by other factors recorded by isotope ratios.

The '''paleontological''' evidence consists of changes in the geographical distribution of fossils. During a glacial period cold-adapted organisms spread into lower latitudes, and organisms that prefer warmer conditions become extinct or are squeezed into lower latitudes. This evidence is also difficult to interpret because it requires (1) sequences of sediments covering a long period of time, over a wide range of latitudes and which are easily correlated; (2) ancient organisms which survive for several million years without change and whose temperature preferences are easily diagnosed; and (3) the finding of the relevant fossils.

Despite the difficulties, analysis of ice core and ocean sediment cores&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Glacier advance in southern middle-latitudes during the Antarctic Cold Reversal |first1=Aaron E. |last1=Putnam |first2=George H. |last2=Denton |first3=Joerg M. |last3=Schaefer |first4=David J.

These also confirm the linkage between ice ages and continental crust phenomena such as glacial moraines, drumlins, and glacial erratics. Hence the continental crust phenomena are accepted as good evidence of earlier ice ages when they are found in layers created much earlier than the time range for which ice cores and ocean sediment cores are available.

==Major ice ages==
[[File:GlaciationsinEarthExistancelicenced annotated.jpg|thumb|upright=2.75|right|Timeline of glaciations, shown in blue.]]
There have been at least five major ice ages in the Earth's history (the [[Huronian]], [[Cryogenian]], [[Andean-Saharan]], [[Karoo Ice Age]], and the current [[Quaternary glaciation|Quaternary Ice Age]]). Outside these ages, the Earth seems to have been ice free even in high latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lockwood, J.G. |title=The Antarctic Ice-Sheet: Regulator of Global Climates?: Review |journal=The Geographical Journal |volume=145 |issue=3 |pages=469–471 |date=November 1979 |jstor=633219 |doi=10.2307/633219 |last2=van Zinderen-Bakker |first2=E.

Several hundreds of km of the [[Huronian Supergroup]] are exposed 10–100&amp;nbsp;km north of the north shore of Lake Huron extending from near Sault Ste.

Correlative Huronian deposits have been found near [[Marquette, Michigan]], and correlation has been made with Paleoproterozoic glacial deposits from Western Australia. The Huronian ice age was caused by the elimination of atmospheric [[methane]], a [[greenhouse gas]], during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopp|first=Robert|date=14 June 2005|title=The Paleoproterozoic snowball Earth: A climate disaster triggered by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/102/32/11131.full.pdf|journal=PNAS|volume=102|issue=32|pages=11131–6|doi=10.1073/pnas.0504878102|pmid=16061801|pmc=1183582|access-date=8 August 2016|bibcode=2005PNAS..10211131K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next well-documented ice age, and probably the most severe of the last billion years, occurred from 850 to 630 million years ago (the [[Cryogenian]] period) and may have produced a [[Snowball Earth]] in which glacial ice sheets reached the equator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hyde WT, Crowley TJ, Baum SK, Peltier WR |author-link4=William Richard Peltier |title=Neoproterozoic 'snowball Earth' simulations with a coupled climate/ice-sheet model |journal=Nature |volume=405 |issue=6785 |pages=425–9 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10839531 |doi=10.1038/35013005 |url=http://www.meteo.mcgill.ca/~tremblay/Courses/ATOC530/Hyde.et.al.Nature.2000.pdf |format=PDF|bibcode=2000Natur.405..425H }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly being ended by the accumulation of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as {{CO2}} produced by volcanoes.

The [[Andean-Saharan]] occurred from 460 to 420 million years ago, during the [[Late Ordovician]] and the [[Silurian]] period.
[[File:Five Myr Climate Change.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Sediment records showing the fluctuating sequences of glacials and interglacials during the last several million years.]]
The evolution of land plants at the onset of the [[Devonian]] period caused a long term increase in planetary oxygen levels and reduction of {{CO2}} levels, which resulted in the [[Karoo Ice Age]]. It is named after the glacial tills found in the Karoo region of South Africa, where evidence for this ice age was first clearly identified. There were extensive polar [[ice cap]]s at intervals from 360 to 260 million years ago in South Africa during the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian|early Permian]] Periods. Correlatives are known from Argentina, also in the center of the ancient supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]].

The [[Quaternary glaciation|Quaternary Glaciation / Quaternary Ice Age]] started about 2.58 million years ago at the beginning of the [[Quaternary|Quaternary Period]] when the spread of ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere began. Since then, the world has seen cycles of glaciation with ice sheets advancing and retreating on 40,000- and 100,000-year time scales called [[glacial period]]s, glacials or glacial advances, and [[interglacial]] periods, interglacials or glacial retreats. The earth is currently in an interglacial, and the last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago. All that remains of the continental [[ice sheet]]s are the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and [[Antarctic ice sheet]]s and smaller glaciers such as on [[Baffin Island]].

The definition of the [[Quaternary]] as beginning 2.58 Ma is based on the formation of the [[Arctic ice cap]]. The [[Antarctic ice sheet]] began to form earlier, at about 34 Ma, in the mid-[[Cenozoic]] ([[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event|Eocene-Oligocene Boundary]]). The term [[Late Cenozoic Ice Age]] is used to include this early phase.&lt;ref name="UHCL"&gt;University of Houston-Clear Lake - Disasters Class Notes - Chapter 12: Climate Change sce.uhcl.edu/Pitts/disastersclassnotes/chapter_12_Climate_Change.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Ice ages can be further divided by location and time; for example, the names ''Riss'' (180,000–130,000 years [[Before Present|bp]]) and ''[[Würm glaciation|Würm]]'' (70,000–10,000 years bp) refer specifically to glaciation in the [[Alps|Alpine region]]. The maximum extent of the ice is not maintained for the full interval. The scouring action of each glaciation tends to remove most of the evidence of prior ice sheets almost completely, except in regions where the later sheet does not achieve full coverage.

Within the ice ages (or at least within the current one), more temperate and more severe periods occur. The colder periods are called ''glacial periods'', the warmer periods ''interglacials'', such as the [[Eemian|Eemian Stage]].

Glacials are characterized by cooler and drier climates over most of the earth and large land and sea ice masses extending outward from the poles. Mountain glaciers in otherwise unglaciated areas extend to lower elevations due to a lower [[snow line]]. Sea levels drop due to the removal of large volumes of water above sea level in the icecaps. There is evidence that ocean circulation patterns are disrupted by glaciations. Since the earth has significant continental glaciation in the Arctic and Antarctic, we are currently in a glacial minimum of a glaciation. Such a period between glacial maxima is known as an ''interglacial''. The glacials and interglacials also coincided with changes in Earth's orbit called [[Milankovitch cycles]].

The earth has been in an interglacial period known as the [[Holocene]] for around 11,700 years,&lt;ref name="Walker, M. 2009. pp. 3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Walker |first1 = M. |last2 = Johnsen |first2 = S. |last3 = Rasmussen |first3 = S.

==Positive and negative feedback in glacial periods==
Each glacial period is subject to [[positive feedback]] which makes it more severe, and [[negative feedback]] which mitigates and (in all cases so far) eventually ends it.

===Positive feedback processes===
Ice and snow increase Earth's [[albedo]], i.e. they make it reflect more of the sun's energy and absorb less. Hence, when the air temperature decreases, ice and snow fields grow, and this continues until competition with a negative feedback mechanism forces the system to an equilibrium. Also, the reduction in [[Boreal forest|forests]] caused by the ice's expansion increases albedo.

Another theory proposed by Ewing and Donn in 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ewing, M.; Donn, W.L. |title=A Theory of Ice Ages |journal=Science |volume=123 |issue=3207 |pages=1061–6 |date=June 1956 |pmid=17748617 |doi=10.1126/science.123.3207.1061 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/123/3207/1061.long|bibcode = 1956Sci...123.1061E |last2=Donn}}&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesized that an ice-free Arctic Ocean leads to increased snowfall at high latitudes. When low-temperature ice covers the Arctic Ocean there is little evaporation or [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] and the polar regions are quite dry in terms of precipitation, comparable to the amount found in mid-latitude [[desert]]s. This low precipitation allows high-latitude snowfalls to melt during the summer. An ice-free Arctic Ocean absorbs solar radiation during the long summer days, and evaporates more water into the Arctic atmosphere. With higher precipitation, portions of this snow may not melt during the summer and so glacial ice can form at lower altitudes ''and'' more southerly latitudes, reducing the temperatures over land by increased albedo as noted above. Furthermore, under this hypothesis the lack of oceanic pack ice allows increased exchange of waters between the Arctic and the North Atlantic Oceans, warming the Arctic and cooling the North Atlantic. (Current projected consequences of [[global warming]] include a largely ice-free Arctic Ocean within 5–20 years, see [[Arctic shrinkage]].) Additional fresh water flowing into the North Atlantic during a warming cycle may also [[shutdown of thermohaline circulation|reduce]] the [[Thermohaline circulation|global ocean water circulation]]. Such a reduction (by reducing the effects of the [[Gulf Stream]]) would have a cooling effect on northern Europe, which in turn would lead to increased low-latitude snow retention during the summer. It has also been suggested that during an extensive glacial, glaciers may move through the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], extending into the North Atlantic Ocean far enough to block the Gulf Stream.

===Negative feedback processes===
Ice sheets that form during glaciations cause erosion of the land beneath them. After some time, this will reduce land above sea level and thus diminish the amount of space on which ice sheets can form. This mitigates the albedo feedback, as does the lowering in sea level that accompanies the formation of ice sheets.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Another factor is the increased aridity occurring with glacial maxima, which reduces the precipitation available to maintain glaciation. The glacial retreat induced by this or any other process can be amplified by similar [[inverse positive feedback]]s as for glacial advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6KbgtwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Another+factor+is+the+increased+aridity+occurring+with+glacial+maxima,+which+reduces+the+precipitation+available+to+maintain+glaciation.+The+glacial+retreat+induced+by+this+or+any+other+process+can+be+amplified+by+similar+inverse+positive+feedbacks+as+for+glacial+advances.|title=Glacial Geology: Ice Sheets and Landforms|last=Bennett|first=Matthew M.|last2=Glasser|first2=Neil F.|date=2010-03-29|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-51690-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in ''[[Nature Geoscience]]'', human emissions of [[carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]] will defer the next ice age. Researchers used data on Earth's orbit to find the historical warm interglacial period that looks most like the current one and from this have predicted that the next ice age would usually begin within 1,500 years. They go on to say that emissions have been so high that it will not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Black|first=Richard|title=Carbon emissions 'will defer Ice Age'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16439807|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 August 2012|date=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of ice ages==
The causes of ice ages are not fully understood for either the large-scale ice age periods or the smaller ebb and flow of glacial–interglacial periods within an ice age. The consensus is that several factors are important: [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric composition]], such as the concentrations of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]] (the specific levels of the previously mentioned gases are now able to be seen with the new ice core samples from EPICA Dome C in Antarctica over the past 800,000 years); changes in the earth's orbit around the [[Sun]] known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]; the motion of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] resulting in changes in the relative location and amount of continental and oceanic crust on the earth's surface, which affect wind and [[ocean current]]s; variations in [[solar variation|solar output]]; the orbital dynamics of the Earth–Moon system; the impact of relatively large [[meteorite]]s and volcanism including eruptions of [[supervolcano]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luthi|first=Dieter|title=High-resolution carbon dioxide concentration record 650,000–800,000 years before present|journal=Nature|date=2008-03-17|volume=453|pages=379–382|doi=10.1038/nature06949|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7193/full/nature06949.html|pmid=18480821|issue=7193|bibcode = 2008Natur.453..379L|display-authors=et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Some of these factors influence each other. For example, changes in Earth's atmospheric composition (especially the concentrations of greenhouse gases) may alter the climate, while climate change itself can change the atmospheric composition (for example by changing the rate at which [[weathering]] removes {{CO2}}).

[[Maureen Raymo]], [[William Ruddiman]] and others propose that the [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibetan]] and [[Colorado Plateau]]s are immense {{CO2}} "scrubbers" with a capacity to remove enough {{CO2}} from the global atmosphere to be a significant causal factor of the 40 million year [[Cenozoic#Climate|Cenozoic Cooling]] trend. They further claim that approximately half of their uplift (and {{CO2}} "scrubbing" capacity) occurred in the past 10 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruddiman | first1 = W.F. | last2 = Kutzbach | first2 = J.E. | year = 1991 | title = Plateau Uplift and Climate Change | journal = Scientific American | volume = 264 | issue = 3| pages = 66–74 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0391-66 |bibcode = 1991SciAm.264c..66R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raymo, Ruddiman"&gt;

===Changes in Earth's atmosphere===

There is evidence that [[greenhouse gas]] levels fell at the start of ice ages and rose during the retreat of the ice sheets, but it is difficult to establish cause and effect (see the notes above on the role of weathering). Greenhouse gas levels may also have been affected by other factors which have been proposed as causes of ice ages, such as the movement of continents and volcanism.

The [[Snowball Earth]] hypothesis maintains that the severe freezing in the late [[Proterozoic]] was ended by an increase in {{CO2}} levels in the atmosphere, mainly from volcanoes, and some supporters of Snowball Earth argue that it was caused in the first place by a reduction in atmospheric {{CO2}}. The hypothesis also warns of future Snowball Earths.

In 2009, further evidence was provided that changes in solar [[insolation]] provide the initial trigger for the earth to warm after an Ice Age, with secondary factors like increases in greenhouse gases accounting for the magnitude of the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Peter U. |last=Clark |first2=Arthur S. |last2=Dyke |first3=Jeremy D. |last3=Shakun |first4=Anders E. |last4=Carlson |first5=Jorie |last5=Clark |first6=Barbara |last6=Wohlfarth |first7=Jerry X. |last7=Mitrovica |first8=Steven W. |last8=Hostetler |first9=A.

====Human-induced changes====

There is considerable evidence that over the very recent period of the last 100–1000 years, the sharp increases in human activity, especially the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s, has caused the parallel sharp and accelerating increase in atmospheric [[greenhouse gas]]es which trap the sun's heat. The consensus theory of the scientific community is that the resulting [[greenhouse effect]] is a principal cause of the increase in [[global warming]] which has occurred over the same period, and a chief contributor to the accelerated melting of the remaining [[glacier]]s and [[polar ice]]. A 2012 investigation finds that dinosaurs released methane through digestion in a similar amount to humanity's current methane release, which "could have been a key factor" to the very warm climate 150 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies |first=Ella |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/17953792 |title=BBC Nature – Dinosaur gases 'warmed the Earth' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Ruddiman has proposed the [[early anthropocene]] hypothesis, according to which the [[anthropocene]] era, as some people call the most recent period in the earth's history when the activities of the human species first began to have a significant global impact on the earth's climate and ecosystems, did not begin in the 18th century with the advent of the Industrial Era, but dates back to 8,000 years ago, due to intense farming activities of our early agrarian ancestors. It was at that time that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations stopped following the periodic pattern of the [[Milankovitch cycles]]. In his [[overdue-glaciation]] hypothesis Ruddiman states that an incipient glacial would probably have begun several thousand years ago, but the arrival of that scheduled glacial was forestalled by the activities of early farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Anthropogenic Greenhouse Era Began Thousands of Years Ago |url=http://earth.geology.yale.edu/~avf5/teaching/Files_pdf/Ruddiman2003.pdf |author=Ruddiman, William F. |year=2003 |doi=10.1023/B:CLIM.0000004577.17928.fa |journal=Climatic Change |volume=61 |pages=261–293 |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416132256/http://earth.geology.yale.edu/~avf5/teaching/Files_pdf/Ruddiman2003.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting of the [[American Geophysical Union]] (December 17, 2008), scientists detailed evidence in support of the controversial idea that the introduction of large-scale rice agriculture in Asia, coupled with extensive deforestation in Europe began to alter world climate by pumping significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over the last 1,000 years. In turn, a warmer atmosphere heated the oceans making them much less efficient storehouses of carbon dioxide and reinforcing global warming, possibly forestalling the onset of a new glacial age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/547541/ Did Early Climate Impact Divert a New Glacial Age?] Newswise, Retrieved on December 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Position of the continents===
The geological record appears to show that ice ages start when the continents are in [[Continental drift|positions]] which block or reduce the flow of warm water from the equator to the poles and thus allow ice sheets to form. The ice sheets increase Earth's [[albedo|reflectivity]] and thus reduce the absorption of solar radiation. With less radiation absorbed the atmosphere cools; the cooling allows the ice sheets to grow, which further increases reflectivity in a [[positive feedback]] loop. The ice age continues until the reduction in weathering causes an increase in the [[greenhouse effect]].

There are three main contributors from the layout of the continents that obstruct the movement of warm water to the poles:{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* A continent sits on top of a pole, as [[Antarctica]] does today.
* A polar sea is almost land-locked, as the Arctic Ocean is today.
* A supercontinent covers most of the equator, as [[Rodinia]] did during the [[Cryogenian]] period.

Since today's Earth has a continent over the South Pole and an almost land-locked ocean over the North Pole, geologists believe that Earth will continue to experience glacial periods in the geologically near future.

Some scientists believe that the [[Himalayas]] are a major factor in the current ice age, because these mountains have increased Earth's total rainfall and therefore the rate at which carbon dioxide is washed out of the atmosphere, decreasing the greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="Raymo, Ruddiman"/&gt; The Himalayas' formation started about 70 million years ago when the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] collided with the [[Eurasian Plate]], and the Himalayas are still rising by about 5&amp;nbsp;mm per year because the Indo-Australian plate is still moving at 67&amp;nbsp;mm/year. The history of the Himalayas broadly fits the long-term decrease in Earth's average temperature since the [[Eocene|mid-Eocene]], 40 million years ago.

===Fluctuations in ocean currents===
Another important contribution to ancient climate regimes is the variation of '''ocean currents''', which are modified by continent position, sea levels and salinity, as well as other factors. They have the ability to cool (e.g. aiding the creation of Antarctic ice) and the ability to warm (e.g. giving the British Isles a temperate as opposed to a boreal climate). The closing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] about 3 million years ago may have ushered in the present period of strong glaciation over North America by ending the exchange of water between the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1996/apr/weareallpanamani743 |title=We are all Panamanians |author=Svitil, K.A. |date=April 1996 |journal=Discover}}—formation of Isthmus of Panama may have started a series of climatic changes that led to evolution of hominids&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyses suggest that ocean current fluctuations can adequately account for recent glacial oscillations. During the last glacial period the sea-level has fluctuated 20–30&amp;nbsp;m as water was sequestered, primarily in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] ice sheets. When ice collected and the sea level dropped sufficiently, flow through the [[Bering Strait]] (the narrow strait between Siberia and Alaska is about 50&amp;nbsp;m deep today) was reduced, resulting in increased flow from the North Atlantic. This realigned the [[thermohaline circulation]] in the Atlantic, increasing heat transport into the Arctic, which melted the polar ice accumulation and reduced other continental ice sheets. The release of water raised sea levels again, restoring the ingress of colder water from the Pacific with an accompanying shift to northern hemisphere ice accumulation.&lt;ref name=Hu2010&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=Aixue |last2=Meehl |first2=Gerald A. |author2link=Gerald Meehl |last3=Otto-Bliesner |first3=Bette L. |last4=Waelbroeck |first4=Claire |author5=Weiqing Han |last6=Loutre |first6=Marie-France |last7=Lambeck |first7=Kurt |last8=Mitrovica |first8=Jerry X. |last9=Rosenbloom |first9=Nan |title=Influence of Bering Strait flow and North Atlantic circulation on glacial sea-level changes |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=118–121 |year=2010 |doi=10.1038/ngeo729 |bibcode=2010NatGe...3..118H|url=http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/ccr/publications/ngeo729.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uplift of the Tibetan plateau and surrounding mountain areas above the snowline===
[[Matthias Kuhle]]'s geological theory of Ice Age development was suggested by the existence of an ice sheet covering the [[Tibetan Plateau]] during the Ice Ages ([[Last Glacial Maximum]]?). According to Kuhle, the plate-tectonic uplift of Tibet past the snow-line has led to a surface of c. 2,400,000 square kilometres (930,000 sq mi) changing from bare land to ice with a 70% greater [[albedo]]. The reflection of energy into space resulted in a global cooling, triggering the [[Pleistocene]] Ice Age. Because this highland is at a subtropical latitude, with 4 to 5 times the insolation of high-latitude areas, what would be Earth's strongest heating surface has turned into a cooling surface.

Kuhle explains the [[interglacial]] periods by the 100,000-year cycle of radiation changes due to variations in Earth's orbit. This comparatively insignificant warming, when combined with the lowering of the Nordic inland ice areas and Tibet due to the weight of the superimposed ice-load, has led to the repeated complete thawing of the inland ice areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuhle, Matthias |chapter=The Pleistocene Glaciation of [[Tibet]] and the Onset of Ice Ages — An Autocycle Hypothesis |title=Tibet and High-Asia: Results of the Sino-German Joint Expeditions (I) |journal=GeoJournal |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=581–595 |date=December 1988 |jstor=41144345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2c (Quaternary Glaciation — Extent and Chronology, Part III: South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, Antarctica{{cite book |author=Kuhle, M. |chapter=The High Glacial (Last Ice Age and LGM) ice cover in High and Central Asia |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xpIEPH7RW4C&amp;pg=PA175 |editor1=Ehlers, J. |editor2=Gibbard, P.L. |title=Quaternary Glaciations: South America, Asia, Africa, Australasia, Antarctica |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-444-51593-3 |pages=175–199 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xpIEPH7RW4C |series=Development in Quaternary Science: Quaternary Glaciations: Extent and Chronology Vol. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuhle, M. |title=Reconstruction of an approximately complete Quaternary Tibetan inland glaciation between the Mt.

===Variations in Earth's orbit (Milankovitch cycles)===
The [[Milankovitch cycles]] are a set of cyclic variations in characteristics of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Each cycle has a different length, so at some times their effects reinforce each other and at other times they (partially) cancel each other.

[[File:SummerSolstice65N-future.png|thumb|upright=2.25|Past and future of daily average insolation at top of the atmosphere on the day of the summer solstice, at 65 N latitude.]]

There is strong evidence that the Milankovitch cycles affect the occurrence of glacial and interglacial periods within an ice age. The present ice age is the most studied and best understood, particularly the last 400,000 years, since this is the period covered by [[ice core]]s that record atmospheric composition and proxies for temperature and ice volume. Within this period, the match of glacial/interglacial frequencies to the Milanković orbital forcing periods is so close that orbital forcing is generally accepted. The combined effects of the changing distance to the Sun, the precession of the Earth's [[axis of rotation|axis]], and the changing tilt of the Earth's axis redistribute the sunlight received by the Earth. Of particular importance are changes in the tilt of the Earth's axis, which affect the intensity of seasons. For example, the amount of solar influx in July at [[65th parallel north|65 degrees north]] [[latitude]] varies by as much as 22% (from 450 W/m² to 550 W/m²). It is widely believed that ice sheets advance when summers become too cool to melt all of the accumulated snowfall from the previous winter. Some believe that the strength of the orbital forcing is too small to trigger glaciations, but feedback mechanisms like {{CO2}} may explain this mismatch.

While Milankovitch forcing predicts that cyclic changes in the Earth's [[orbital elements]] can be expressed in the glaciation record, additional explanations are necessary to explain which cycles are observed to be most important in the timing of glacial–interglacial periods. In particular, during the last 800,000 years, the dominant period of glacial–interglacial oscillation has been 100,000 years, which corresponds to [[Perturbation (astronomy)|changes]] in Earth's [[orbital eccentricity]] and orbital [[inclination]]. Yet this is by far the weakest of the three frequencies predicted by Milankovitch. During the period 3.0–0.8 million years ago, the dominant pattern of glaciation corresponded to the 41,000-year period of changes in Earth's [[obliquity]] (tilt of the axis). The reasons for dominance of one frequency versus another are poorly understood and an active area of current research, but the answer probably relates to some form of resonance in the Earth's climate system.  Recent work suggests that the 100K year cycle dominates due to increased southern-pole sea-ice increasing total solar reflectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/01/iceages|title=Earth’s orbital variations and sea ice synch glacial periods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciforums.com/threads/ice-age-explanation.158750/|title=Ice-Age Explanation - Sciforums|website=www.sciforums.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "traditional" Milankovitch explanation struggles to explain the dominance of the 100,000-year cycle over the last 8 cycles. [[Richard A. Muller]], [[Gordon J. F. MacDonald]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Muller, R.A.; MacDonald, G.J. |title=Spectrum of 100-kyr glacial cycle: orbital inclination, not eccentricity |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

They proposed that these variations in orbital inclination lead to variations in insolation, as the Earth moves in and out of known dust bands in the solar system. Although this is a different mechanism to the traditional view, the "predicted" periods over the last 400,000 years are nearly the same. The Muller and MacDonald theory, in turn, has been challenged by Jose Antonio Rial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rial, J.A. |title=Pacemaking the ice ages by frequency modulation of Earth's orbital eccentricity |journal=Science |volume=285 |issue=5427 |pages=564–8 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10417382 |url=http://pangea.stanford.edu/Oceans/GES290/Rial1999.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1126/science.285.5427.564 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015123309/http://pangea.stanford.edu/Oceans/GES290/Rial1999.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another worker, [[William Ruddiman]], has suggested a model that explains the 100,000-year cycle by the [[modulating]] effect of eccentricity (weak 100,000-year cycle) on precession (26,000-year cycle) combined with greenhouse gas feedbacks in the 41,000- and 26,000-year cycles. Yet another theory has been advanced by [[Peter Huybers]] who argued that the 41,000-year cycle has always been dominant, but that the Earth has entered a mode of climate behavior where only the second or third cycle triggers an ice age. This would imply that the 100,000-year periodicity is really an illusion created by averaging together cycles lasting 80,000 and 120,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huybers, P.; Wunsch, C. |title=Obliquity pacing of the late Pleistocene glacial terminations |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7032 |pages=491–4 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15791252 |doi=10.1038/nature03401 |bibcode = 2005Natur.434..491H |last2=Wunsch|url=http://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/555/1/ObliquityPacing.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is consistent with a simple empirical multi-state model proposed by [[Didier Paillard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paillard, D. |title=The timing of Pleistocene glaciations from a simple multiple-state climate model |journal=Nature |volume=391 |issue=6665 |pages=378–381 |date=22 January 1998 |doi=10.1038/34891 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v391/n6665/abs/391378a0.html|bibcode = 1998Natur.391..378P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paillard suggests that the late Pleistocene glacial cycles
can be seen as jumps between three quasi-stable climate states. The jumps are induced by the [[orbit]]al forcing, while in the early Pleistocene the 41,000-year glacial cycles resulted from jumps between only two climate states. A dynamical
model explaining this behavior was proposed by Peter Ditlevsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ditlevsen, P.D. |title=Bifurcation structure and noise-assisted transitions in the Pleistocene glacial cycles |journal=Paleoceanography |volume=24 |pages=PA3204 |year=2009 |doi=10.1029/2008PA001673 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008PA001673.shtml |bibcode=2009PalOc..24.3204D |issue=3|arxiv = 0902.1641}} as [http://www.gfy.ku.dk/~pditlev/papers/2008PA001673.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; This is in support of the suggestion that the late [[Pleistocene]] glacial cycles are not due to the weak 100,000-year eccentricity cycle, but a non-linear response to mainly the 41,000-year obliquity cycle.

===Variations in the Sun's energy output===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
There are at least two types of variation in the Sun's energy output
* In the very long term, astrophysicists believe that the Sun's output increases by about 7% every one billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) years.
* Shorter-term variations such as [[sunspot|sunspot cycles]], and longer episodes such as the [[Maunder Minimum]], which occurred during the coldest part of the [[Little Ice Age]].

The long-term increase in the Sun's output cannot be a cause of ice ages.

===Volcanism===
Volcanic eruptions may have contributed to the inception and/or the end of ice age periods. At times during the paleoclimate, carbon dioxide levels were two or three times greater than today. Volcanoes and movements in continental plates contributed to high amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide from volcanoes probably contributed to periods with highest overall temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rieke|first=George|title=Long Term Climate|url=http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/lectures/climate.htm|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suggested explanation of the [[Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]] is that undersea volcanoes released [[methane]] from [[clathrate]]s and thus caused a large and rapid increase in the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/climate/PETM.asp|title=PETM: Global Warming, Naturally {{!}} Weather Underground|website=www.wunderground.com|access-date=2016-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202234346/https://www.wunderground.com/climate/PETM.asp|archivedate=2016-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There appears to be no geological evidence for such eruptions at the right time, but this does not prove they did not happen.

The current ice age, called the [[Quaternary glaciation]], which began 2.6 million years ago and extends into the present,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/earth/water_and_ice/ice_age Ice Ages]". BBC Earth. &lt;/ref&gt; has seen more or less extensive glaciation on 40,000 and later, 100,000 year cycles. The [[interglacial]]s lasted about 10,000–20,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/prehistoric-world/quaternary/ Quaternary Period]". National Geographic.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[last glacial period]] ended about 11,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/earth/earth_timeline/quaternary_ice_age Glaciers advance and retreat]". BBC Earth.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Earth has been in an interglacial period called the [[Holocene]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.britannica.com/science/Holocene-Epoch Holocene Epoch]".  Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glacial stages in North America===
The major glacial stages of the current ice age in North America are the [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinoian]], [[Eemian]] and [[Wisconsin glaciation]]. The use of the Nebraskan, Afton, Kansan, and Yarmouthian stages to subdivide the ice age in North America has been discontinued by Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists. These stages have all been merged into the [[Pre-Illinoian]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Hallberg1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hallberg, G.R. |title=Pre-Wisconsin glacial stratigraphy of the Central Plains region in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |volume=5 |pages=11–15 |year=1986 |doi=10.1016/0277-3791(86)90169-1 |bibcode = 1986QSRv....5...11H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RichmondOther1"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Richmond, G.M. |author2=Fullerton, D.S. |title=Summation of Quaternary glaciations in the United States of America |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |volume=5 |pages=183–196 |year=1986 |doi=10.1016/0277-3791(86)90184-8 |bibcode = 1986QSRv....5..183R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GibbardOthers2007"&gt;Gibbard, P.L., S.

During the most recent North American glaciation, during the latter part of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (26,000 to 13,300 years ago), ice sheets extended to about [[45th parallel north]]. These sheets were {{convert|3 to 4|km}} thick.&lt;ref name="RichmondOther1"/&gt;
[[File:Glacial lakes.jpg|thumb|right|Stages of [[proglacial lake]] development in the region of the current North American [[Great Lakes]].]] 

This Wisconsin glaciation left widespread impacts on the North American landscape. The [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Finger Lakes]] were carved by ice deepening old valleys. Most of the lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin were gouged out by glaciers and later filled with glacial meltwaters. The old [[Teays River]] drainage system was radically altered and largely reshaped into the [[Ohio River]] drainage system. Other rivers were dammed and diverted to new channels, such as [[Niagara Falls]], which formed a dramatic waterfall and gorge, when the waterflow encountered a limestone escarpment. Another similar waterfall, at the present [[Clark Reservation State Park]] near [[Syracuse, New York]], is now dry.

The area from [[Long Island]] to [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]] was formed from glacial [[till]], and the plethora of lakes on the [[Canadian Shield]] in northern Canada can be almost entirely attributed to the action of the ice. As the ice retreated and the rock dust dried, winds carried the material hundreds of miles, forming beds of [[loess]] many dozens of feet thick in the [[Missouri River|Missouri Valley]]. [[Post-glacial rebound]] continues to reshape the Great Lakes and other areas formerly under the weight of the ice sheets.

The [[Driftless Area]], a portion of western and southwestern Wisconsin along with parts of adjacent [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], and [[Illinois]], was not covered by glaciers.

===Last Glacial Period in the semiarid Andes around Aconcagua and Tupungato===
A specially interesting climatic change during glacial times has taken place in the semi-arid Andes. Beside the expected cooling down in comparison with the current climate, a significant precipitation change happened here. So, researches in the presently semiarid subtropic Aconcagua-massif (6,962&amp;nbsp;m) have shown an unexpectedly extensive glacial glaciation of the type "ice stream network".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuhle, M. |title=Spuren hocheiszeitlicher Gletscherbedeckung in der Aconcagua-Gruppe (32–33° S) |journal=Zentralblatt für Geologie und Paläontologie Teil I, Geologie |volume=11/12 |pages=1635–46 |year=1984 |issn=0340-5109}} Verhandlungsblatt des Südamerika-Symposiums 1984 in Bamberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuhle, M. |title=Die Vergletscherung Tibets und die Entstehung von Eiszeiten |journal=Spektrum der Wissenschaft |volume= |issue=9/86 |pages=42–54 |year=1986 |issn=0170-2971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuhle, Matthias |title=Subtropical Mountain- and Highland-Glaciation as Ice Age Triggers and the Waning of the Glacial Periods in the Pleistocene |journal=GeoJournal |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=393–421 |date=June 1987 |jstor=41144132 |doi=10.1007/BF02602717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhle04&gt;{{cite book |author=Kuhle, M. |chapter=The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) glacier cover of the Aconcagua group and adjacent massifs in the Mendoza Andes (South America) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xpIEPH7RW4C&amp;pg=PA75 |editor1=Ehlers, J. |editor2=Gibbard, P.L. |title=Quaternary Glaciations: South America, Asia, Africa, Australasia, Antarctica |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-444-51593-3 |pages=75–81 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2xpIEPH7RW4C |series=Development in Quaternary Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhle11&gt;{{cite book |author=Kuhle, M. |chapter=Ch 53: The High-Glacial (Last Glacial Maximum) Glacier Cover of the Aconcagua Group and Adjacent Massifs in the Mendoza Andes (South America) with a Closer Look at Further Empirical Evidence |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jv4uA1lHezEC&amp;pg=PA735 |editor1=Ehlers, J. |editor2=Gibbard, P.L. |editor3=Hughes, P.D. |title=Quaternary Glaciations – Extent and Chronology: A Closer Look |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-444-53447-7 |pages=735–8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jv4uA1lHezEC |series=Development in Quaternary Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connected valley glaciers exceeding 100&amp;nbsp;km in length, flowed down on the East-side of this section of the Andes at 32–34°S and 69–71°W as far as a height of 2,060&amp;nbsp;m and on the western luff-side still clearly deeper.&lt;ref name=Kuhle11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brüggen, J. |title=Zur Glazialgeologie der chilenischen Anden |journal=Geol.

==Effects of glaciation==
[[File:Scandinavia.TMO2003050.jpg|right|thumb|[[Scandinavia]] exhibits some of the typical effects of ice age glaciation such as [[fjord]]s and lakes.]]
{{See also|Glacial landform}}
Although the last glacial period ended more than 8,000 years ago, its effects can still be felt today. For example, the moving ice carved out the landscape in Canada (See [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]]), Greenland, northern Eurasia and Antarctica. The [[erratic boulder]]s, [[till]], [[drumlin]]s, [[esker]]s, [[fjord]]s, [[kettle lake]]s, [[moraine]]s, [[cirque]]s, [[Glacial horn|horns]], etc., are typical features left behind by the glaciers.

The weight of the ice sheets was so great that they deformed the Earth's crust and mantle. After the ice sheets melted, the ice-covered land [[Post-glacial rebound|rebounded]]. Due to the high [[viscosity]] of the [[Earth's mantle]], the flow of mantle rocks which controls the rebound process is very slow—at a rate of about 1&amp;nbsp;cm/year near the center of rebound area today.

During glaciation, water was taken from the oceans to form the ice at high latitudes, thus global sea level dropped by about 110 meters, exposing the continental shelves and forming land-bridges between land-masses for animals to migrate. During [[deglaciation]], the melted ice-water returned to the oceans, causing sea level to rise. This process can cause sudden shifts in coastlines and hydration systems resulting in newly submerged lands, emerging lands, collapsed [[Proglacial lake|ice dam]]s resulting in [[salinity|salination]] of lakes, new ice dams creating vast areas of freshwater, and a general alteration in regional weather patterns on a large but temporary scale. It can even cause temporary [[reglaciation]]. This type of chaotic pattern of rapidly changing land, ice, saltwater and freshwater has been proposed as the likely model for the [[Baltic states|Baltic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n regions, as well as much of central North America at the end of the last glacial maximum, with the present-day coastlines only being achieved in the last few millennia of prehistory. Also, the effect of elevation on Scandinavia submerged a vast continental plain that had existed under much of what is now the North Sea, connecting the British Isles to Continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Bjørn G. |last2=Borns |first2=Harold W. Jr. |title=The Ice Age World: an introduction to quaternary history and research with emphasis on North America and Northern Europe during the last 2.5 million years |year=1997 |url=http://www.universitetsforlaget.no/boker/realfagogit/biologi_geologi_og_miljoefag/katalog?productId=674197 |publisher=[[Universitetsforlaget]] |location=Oslo |isbn=978-82-00-37683-5 |accessdate=2013-10-14 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redistribution of ice-water on the surface of the Earth and the flow of mantle rocks causes changes in the [[Gravity of Earth|gravitational field]] as well as changes to the distribution of the [[moment of inertia]] of the Earth. These changes to the moment of inertia result in a change in the [[angular velocity]], [[Axis of rotation|axis]], and wobble of the Earth's rotation.

The weight of the redistributed surface mass loaded the [[lithosphere]], caused it to [[Bending|flex]] and also induced [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] within the Earth. The presence of the glaciers generally suppressed the movement of [[Fault (geology)|faults]] below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Johnston, A. |chapter=The effect of large ice sheets on earthquake genesis |editor1=Gregersen, S. |editor2=Basham, P. |title=Earthquakes at North-Atlantic passive margins: Neotectonics and postglacial rebound |publisher=Kluwer |location=Dordrecht |year=1989 |isbn=0-7923-0150-1 |pages=581–599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wu, P.; Hasegawa, H.S. |title=Induced stresses and fault potential in eastern Canada due to a realistic load: a preliminary analysis |journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]] |volume=127 |issue=1 |pages=215–229 |date=October 1996 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.1996.tb01546.x |bibcode = 1996GeoJI.127..215W |last2=Hasegawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turpeinen | first1 = H. | last2 = Hampel | first2 = A. | last3 = Karow | first3 = T. | last4 = Maniatis | first4 = G. | year = 2008 | title = Effect of ice sheet growth and melting on the slip evolution of thrust faults | journal = [[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]] | volume = 269 | pages = 230–241 |bibcode = 2008E&amp;PSL.269..230T |doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2008.02.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[deglaciation]], the faults experience accelerated slip triggering [[earthquake]]s. Earthquakes triggered near the ice margin may in turn accelerate [[ice calving]] and may account for the [[Heinrich events]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hunt, A.G.; Malin, P.E. |title=Possible triggering of Heinrich events by ice-load-induced earthquakes |journal=Nature |volume=393 |issue=6681 |pages=155–8 |date=14 May 1998 |doi=10.1038/30218 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v393/n6681/abs/393155a0.html|bibcode = 1998Natur.393..155H |last2=Malin}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more ice is removed near the ice margin, more [[intraplate earthquake]]s are induced and this positive feedback may explain the fast collapse of ice sheets.

In Europe, glacial erosion and [[isostasy|isostatic]] sinking from weight of ice made the [[Baltic Sea]], which before the Ice Age was all land drained by the [[Eridanos (geology)|Eridanos River]].

'''Innocent passage''' is a concept in the [[law of the sea]] that allows for a vessel to pass through the [[territorial waters]] of another state, subject to certain restrictions. The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] Article 19 defines innocent passage as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1.	Passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State. Such passage shall take place in conformity with this Convention and with other rules of international law.

2.	Passage of a foreign ship shall be considered to be prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State if in the territorial sea it engages in any of the following activities:

(a)	any threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of the coastal State, or in any other manner in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations;

(b)	any exercise or practice with weapons of any kind;

(c)	any act aimed at collecting information to the prejudice of the defence or security of the coastal State;

(d)	any act of propaganda aimed at affecting the defence or security of the coastal State;

(e)	the launching, landing or taking on board of any aircraft;

(f)	the launching, landing or taking on board of any military device;

(g)	the loading or unloading of any commodity, currency or person contrary to the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations of the coastal State;

(h)	any act of wilful and serious pollution contrary to this Convention;

(i)	any fishing activities;

(j)	the carrying out of research or survey activities;

(k)	any act aimed at interfering with any systems of communication or any other facilities or installations of the coastal State;

(l)	any other activity not having a direct bearing on passage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm UN CLS, Part II]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innocent passage concedes the coastal country's territorial sea claim, unlike [[freedom of navigation]], which directly contests it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/02/are-freedom-of-navigation-operations-and-innocent-passage-really-the-same/ |title=Are Freedom of Navigation Operations and Innocent Passage Really the Same? |last=Bosco |first=Joseph A. |website=The Diplomat |access-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-southchinasea-exclusive-idUSKBN1AQ0YK|title=U.S. destroyer challenges China's claims in South China Sea|last=|first=|date=2017-08-10|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-08-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was codified in 1958 and affirmed in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9z3h6uy7CYC |title=Navigational Rights and Freedoms, and the New Law of the Sea |last=Rothwell |first=Donald R. |last2=Bateman |first2=W.

A ridge of low [[Jurassic]] hills runs through the county, separating the basins of the [[River Welland|Welland]] and [[River Nene|Nene]] rivers. The county has good communications as it is crossed by two main railway lines and the [[M1 motorway]], and it has many small industrial centres rather than large conurbations. The main architectural feature is its country houses and mansions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Northamptonshire |title=Northamptonshire |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=3 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422111132/http://www.britannica.com/place/Northamptonshire |archivedate=22 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metropolitan France]] contains a total of {{convert|16900000|ha|sqmi}} of tree coverage, with {{convert|13800000|ha|sqmi}} considered to be forestry by the National Forest Inventory (IFN).  Of those {{convert|13800000|ha|sqmi}}, {{convert|8700000|ha|sqmi}} consist of leafy forests while the remaining {{convert|5100000|ha|sqmi}} consist of evergreen forests.

The majority of forestry in French overseas departments is found in [[French Guiana]], which contains {{convert|7500000|ha|sqmi}} of forests.

{{convert|3700000|ha|sqmi}} of forests in France are publicly owned, with the remaining {{convert|10100000|ha|sqmi}} being privately owned.  Two-thirds of privately owned forests are larger than {{convert|10|ha|acre}}, and 48% are larger than {{convert|25|ha|acre}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">The main components of automobile exhaust are [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and  water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Carbon dioxide is the most important [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) and the most significant [[Greenhouse Gas]] emitted in the U.S. (with 82-84% of all U.S. emissions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbuilder.com/sbc/newsletters/99july.html July 1999 SBC Newsletter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427125401/http://www.greenbuilder.com/sbc/newsletters/99july.html |date=2007-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in carbon dioxide concentration are due primarily to [[fossil fuel]] use and [[land-use]] change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], ''{{cite web|url= http://www.20minutos.es/data/adj/2007/02/02/456.pdf |title=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(2.20&amp;nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]])}}'' .&lt;/ref&gt;

The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission standards can be referred to the [[fuel]] or to the [[vehicle]] :

*The [[European Union]] is moving towards fuel mandatory CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; standards and USA has reflected it in the [[Greenhouse Gas Score]].
*There are information, but no mandatory, standards for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; limits in vehicle (engine) emissions, excepting some state regulations (i.e. California). See [[hybrid vehicles]].

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mass emission in vehicles is measured in '''g/km''' (g/[[mile|mi]] * 0.621371192 = g/km).

== Low carbon fuel standard ==

In [[Greek mythology]], '''maenads''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|n|æ|d|z}}; {{lang-grc|μαϊνάδες}} {{IPA-grc|maiˈnades|}}) were the female followers of [[Dionysus]] and the most significant members of the [[Thiasus]], the god's retinue. Their name literally translates as "raving ones". Maenads were known as '''Bassarids''', '''Bacchae''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|k|iː}} or '''Bacchantes''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|k|ə|n|t|s|,_|b|ə|ˈ|k|æ|n|t|s|,_|-|ˈ|k|ɑː|n|t|s}} in [[Roman mythology]] after the penchant of the equivalent Roman god, [[Bacchus]], to wear a [[bassaris]] or [[fox]]-skin.

Often the maenads were portrayed as inspired by Dionysus into a state of [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic frenzy]] through a combination of dancing and [[alcohol intoxication|intoxication]].&lt;ref name="wiles"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wiles | first = David | title = Greek Theater Performance: An Introduction | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | location = Cambridge, England | url = http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=052164027X }}&lt;/ref&gt; During these rites, the maenads would dress in [[fawn]] skins and carry a [[thyrsus]], a long stick wrapped in ivy or vine leaves and tipped with a [[pine cone]]. They would weave ivy-wreaths around their heads or wear a bull helmet in honor of their god, and often handle or wear snakes.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest L. Abel, ''Intoxication in Mythology: A Worldwide Dictionary of Gods, Rites, Intoxicants, and Place'' McFarland; Jefferson, NC and London 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

These women were [[mythology|mythologized]] as the 'mad women' who were nurses of Dionysus in [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]]. [[Lycurgus of Thrace|Lycurgus]] "chased the Nurses of the frenzied Dionysus through the holy hills of Nysa, and the sacred implements dropped to the ground from the hands of one and all, as the murderous Lycurgus struck them down with his ox-goad".&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''[[Iliad]]'', VI.130ff, in [[E.V. Rieu]]'s translation.&lt;/ref&gt; They went into the mountains at night and practiced strange rites.&lt;ref name="lever"&gt;{{ cite book | last = Lever | first = Katherine | title = The Art of Greek Comedy | year = 1956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plutarch]]'s ''Life of Alexander'', maenads were called ''Mimallones'' and ''Klodones'' in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], epithets derived from the feminine art of spinning wool.&lt;ref&gt;According to Grace Harriet Macurdy, "Klodones, Mimallones and Dionysus Pseudanor," ''The Classical Review'' '''27'''.6 (September 1913), pp. 191-192, and ''Troy and Paeonia. With Glimpses of Ancient Balkan History and Religion'', 1925, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these warlike ''parthenoi'' ("virgins") from the hills, associated with a ''Dionysios pseudanor'' "fake male Dionysus", routed an invading enemy.&lt;ref&gt;According to the second-century CE Macedonian military writer [[Polyaenus]], IV.1; Polyaenus gives a fanciful etymology..&lt;/ref&gt; In southern Greece they were described with ''Bacchae'', ''Bassarides'', ''[[Thyia]]des'', ''Potniades''&lt;ref&gt;''Potnia'', the "power" of maddened intoxication.&lt;/ref&gt; and other epithets.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "The Maenads", ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion'', 3rd ed. (1922:388-400) p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''maenad'' has come to be associated with a wide variety of women, supernatural, mythological, and historical,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Ellen Harrison]] remarked of the 19th-century (male) classicists, "so persistent is the dislike to commonplace fact, that we are repeatedly told that the maenads are purely mythological creations and that the maenad orgies never appear historically in Greece." ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion'' (1903; 1922), p.388.&lt;/ref&gt; associated with the god Dionysus and his worship.
[[File:Dancing maenad Python BM VaseF253.jpg|thumb|Dancing maenad. Detail from an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Paestum]] [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[skyphos]], made by Python, ca. 330-320 BC. [[British Museum]], London]]

In [[Euripides]]' play ''[[The Bacchae]]'', maenads of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] murder [[Pentheus|King Pentheus]] after he bans the worship of Dionysus. Dionysus, Pentheus' cousin, himself lures Pentheus to the woods, where the maenads tear him apart. His corpse is mutilated by his own mother, [[Agave (Theban princess)|Agave]], who tears off his head, believing it to be that of a lion. A group of maenads also kill [[Orpheus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.3.2 ''Library and Epitome'', 1.3.2]. "Orpheus also invented the mysteries of Dionysus, and having been torn in pieces by the maenads he is buried in [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ceramic art]], the frolicking of Maenads and Dionysus is often a theme depicted on [[krater]]s, used to mix water and wine. These scenes show the maenads in their frenzy running in the forests, often tearing to pieces any animal they happen to come across.

German [[philology|philologist]] [[Walter Friedrich Otto]] writes:
{{quote|''The Bacchae'' of Euripides gives us the most vital picture of the wonderful circumstance in which, as [[Plato]] says in the ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', the god-intoxicated celebrants draw milk and honey from the streams. They strike rocks with the thyrsus, and water gushes forth. They lower the thyrsus to the earth, and a spring of wine bubbles up. If they want milk, they scratch up the ground with their fingers and draw up the milky fluid. Honey trickles down from the thyrsus made of the wood of the ivy, they gird themselves with snakes and give suck to fawns and wolf cubs as if they were infants at the breast. Fire does not burn them. No weapon of iron can wound them, and the snakes harmlessly lick up the sweat from their heated cheeks. Fierce bulls fall to the ground, victims to numberless, tearing female hands, and sturdy trees are torn up by the roots with their combined efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Otto, ''Dionysus: Myth and Cult'' Indiana University Press; Bloomington and Indianapolis 1965. p.96&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Cult worship==
===Bacchanalia===
{{further|Bacchanalia}}
Cultist rites associated with worship of the Greek god of wine, Dionysus (or Bacchus in Roman mythology), were allegedly characterized by maniacal dancing to the sound of loud music and crashing cymbals, in which the revelers, called Bacchantes, whirled, screamed, became drunk and incited one another to greater and greater ecstasy. The goal was to achieve a state of enthusiasm in which the celebrants’ souls were temporarily freed from their earthly bodies and were able to commune with Bacchus/Dionysus and gain a glimpse of and a preparation for what they would someday experience in eternity. The rite climaxed in a performance of frenzied feats of strength and madness, such as uprooting trees, tearing a [[bull]] (the symbol of Dionysus) apart with their bare hands, an act called ''[[sparagmos]]'', and eating its flesh raw, an act called ''[[omophagia]]''. This latter rite was a sacrament akin to communion in which the participants assumed the strength and character of the god by symbolically eating the raw flesh and drinking the blood of his symbolic incarnation. Having symbolically eaten his body and drunk his blood, the celebrants became possessed by Dionysus.&lt;!--no:The main shrines where these rites took place were at Delphi and Eleusis.--&gt;

===Priestesses of Dionysus===
[[File:Satyroi Mainade Louvre K19.jpg|thumb|Two satyrs and a maenad. Side A from an Ancient Greek [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[kylyx (drinking cup)|kylyx]]-[[krater]] from [[Apulia]], 380–370 BC. [[Louvre]], Paris.]]
[[File:Dionysos Mainades Cdm Paris 222.jpg|thumb|Dionysus and two Maenads, as depicted by the Amasis Painter circa 550-530BC.]]
'Maenads' are found in later references as priestesses of the Dionystic cult. In the third century BC, when an [[Asia Minor]] city wanted to create a maenadic cult of Dionysus, the [[Delphic Oracle]] bid them to send to Thebes for both instruction and three professional maenads, stating, "Go to the holy plain of Thebes so that you may get maenads who are from the family of [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], daughter of [[Cadmus]]. They will give to you both the rites and good practices, and they will establish dance groups (thiasoi) of Bacchus [ie: Dionysus] in your city."

==Myths==
Dionysus came to his birthplace, Thebes, where neither Pentheus, his cousin who was now king, nor Pentheus’ mother Agave, Dionysus’ aunt (Semele’s sister) acknowledged his divinity. Dionysus punished Agave by driving her insane, and in that condition, she killed her son and tore him to pieces. From Thebes, Dionysus went to Argos where all the women except the daughters of King Proetus joined in his worship. Dionysus punished them by driving them mad, and they killed the infants who were nursing at their breasts. He did the same to the daughters of Minyas, King of Orchomenos in Boetia, and then turned them into bats.

[[File:Women_of_Amphissa.jpg|thumb|''The Women of Amphissa'' by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] ]]
According to Opian, Dionysus delighted, as a child, in tearing kids into pieces and bringing them back to life again. He is characterized as "the raging one", and "the mad one", and the nature of the maenads, from which they get their name, is, therefore, his nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Dionysus: Myth and Cult''; Indiana University Press; Bloomington and Indianapolis 1965. pg. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once during a war in the middle of the third century BC, the entranced Thyiades (maenads) lost their way and arrived in [[Amphissa (city)|Amphissa]], a city near Delphi. There they sank down exhausted in the market place and were overpowered by a deep sleep. The women of Amphissa formed a protective ring around them and when they awoke arranged for them to return home unmolested.

On another occasion, the Thyiades were snowed in on [[Parnassos]] and it was necessary to send a rescue party. The clothing of the men who took part in the rescue froze solid. It is unlikely that the Thyiades, even if they wore deerskins over their shoulders, were ever dressed more warmly than the men.&lt;ref&gt;''Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life''; translated from the German by Ralph Manheim; Bollingen Series LXV 2; Princeton University Press 1976. pg. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nurses and nymphs===
In the realm of the [[supernatural]] is the category of [[nymph]]s who nurse and care for the young Dionysus, and continue in his worship as he comes of age. The god [[Hermes]] is said to have carried the young Dionysus to the nymphs of Nysa.

In another myth, when his mother, Semele, is killed, the care of young Dionysus falls into the hands of his sisters, Ino, Agave, and [[Autonoe]], who later are depicted as participating in the rites and taking a leadership role among the other maenads.

===Resisters to the new religion===
[[File:Kylix by Makron Mainade Satyros Staatliche Antikensammlungen 480BC Kat 94 02.jpg|thumb|left|Maenad and [[Satyr]]. [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by [[Makron (vase painter)|Makron]], 490-480 BC. Staatliche Antikensammlungen München Kat. 94]]
The term 'maenads' also refers to women in the mythology who resisted the worship of Dionysus, and were therefore driven mad by him, forced against their will to participate in often horrific rites. The doubting women of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], the prototypical maenads, or 'mad women', left their homes to live in the wilds of the nearby mountain [[Cithaeron]]. When they discover [[Pentheus]] spying on them, dressed as a maenad, they tear him limb from limb.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Bacchae''&lt;/ref&gt;

This also occurs with the three daughters of [[Minyas (mythology)|Minyas]], who reject Dionysus and remain true to their household duties, becoming startled by invisible drums, flutes, cymbals, and seeing ivy hanging down from their looms. As punishment for their resistance, they become madwomen, choosing the child of one of their number by lot and tearing it to pieces, as the women on the mountain did to young animals. A similar story with a tragic end is told of the daughters of [[Proetus]].

===Voluntary revelers===
Not all women were inclined to resist the call of Dionysus, however. Maenads, possessed by the spirit of Dionysus, traveled with him from Thrace to mainland Greece in his quest for the recognition of his divinity. Dionysus was said to have danced down from Parnassos accompanied by Delphic virgins, and it is known that even as young girls the women in Boeotia practiced not only the closed rites but also the bearing of the thyrsus and the dances.

The foundation myth is believed to have been reenacted every other year during the Agrionia. Here the women of Thebes were organized into three dance groups and rushed off to Mount Cithaeron with ritual cries of "to the mountain!" As "mad women," they pursued and killed, perhaps by dismemberment (sparagmos), the 'king', possibly represented by a goat. The maenads may have eaten the meat of the goat raw (omophagia) or sacrificed it to Dionysus. Eventually the women would be freed from the madness and return to Thebes and their usual lives, but for the time of the festival they would have had an intense ecstatic experience. The Agrionia was celebrated in several Greek cities, but especially in Boeotia. Each Boeotian city had its own distinct foundation myth for it, but the pattern was much the same: the arrival of Dionysus, resistance to him, flight of the women to a mountain, the killing of Dionysus’ persecutor, and eventual reconciliation with the god.

==Art==
Maenads have been depicted in art as erratic and frenzied women enveloped in a drunken rapture, the most obvious example being that of Euripides’ play The Bacchae. His play, however, is not a study of the cult of Dionysus or the effects of this religious hysteria of these women. The maenads have often been interpreted in art in this way. To understand the play of Euripides though one must only know about the religious ecstasy called Dionysiac, the most common moment maenads are displayed in art. In Euripides' play and other art forms and works the Dionysiac only needs to be understood as the frenzied dances of the god which are direct manifestations of euphoric possession and that these worshippers, sometimes by eating the flesh of a man or animal who has temporarily incarnated the god, come to partake of his divinity.

In addition to Euripides' The Bacchae, depictions of maenads are often found on both [[Red figure pottery|red]] and [[Black figure pottery|black figure]] Greek pottery, statues and jewellery.  Also, fragments of reliefs of female worshippers of Dionysus have been discovered at Corinth.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''A Group of Dionsiac Sculptures from Corinth''&lt;/ref&gt; Mark W. Edwards in his paper "Representation of Maenads on Archaic Red-Figure Vases" traces the evolution of maenad's depictions on Red-Figure vases. Edwards distinguishes between "nymphs" which appear earlier on Greek pottery and "maenads" which are identified by their characteristic fawnskin or "''nebris''" and often carrying snakes in their hands. However, Edwards does not consider the actions of the figures on the pottery to be a distinguishing characteristic for differentiation between maenads and nymphs. Rather, the differences or similarities in their actions are more striking when comparing black-figure and red-figure pottery, as opposed to maenads and nymphs.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''Representation of Maenads on Archaic Red-Figure Vases''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later culture==

[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1906, La dance (Bacchante), oil on canvas, 73 x 54 cm DSC05359...jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1906, ''[[La danse, Bacchante]]'', oil on canvas, 73 x 54 cm. The subject of Maenads remained popular in the arts at least into the early 20th century]]

A maenad appears in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s poem, ''[[Ode to the West Wind]]''.

In [[Ivan Turgenev]]'s novella, ''[[First Love (novella)|First Love]]'', bacchantes are used symbolically in a dream of princess Zinaida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiztrit.com/excerpt/?e=3d|title=Excerpt from First Love|last= Turgenev|first= Ivan Sergeyevich|date=|website= Wiztrit|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Bassarids]]'' (composed 1964–65, premiered 1966), to a libretto by [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Chester Kallman]], is the most famous opera composed by [[Hans Werner Henze]].

Maenads, along with [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] and [[Silenus]], appear in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[Prince Caspian]]''. They are portrayed as wild, fierce girls who dance and perform somersaults.

[[Poul Anderson]]'s [[Goat Song (novelette)|"Goat Song"]] depicts a [[far future|far-future]] [[utopia]] where all human activity has been "optimized" by the [[artificial intelligence]] SUM. To placate their fear of dying, citizens of this utopia are promised resurrection using DNA and memory records collected by bracelets that everyone wears. Rebelling against nonhuman control, one citizen called Harper (identified with Orpheus) awakens [[atavism]] in a group of women who spend holidays in the wild living as maenads.

In the short story "Las Ménades", by [[Julio Cortázar]], originally published in ''[[Final del juego]]'' in 1956, describes a concert in which the narrator does not react emotionally to the music; but a number of women are overwhelmed with emotion, and surge onto the stage, overtaking the conductor and musicians.

In [[Piers Anthony]]'s [[Xanth|Xanth series]], the Maenads are depicted as women frenzied with [[Blood as food| bloodlust]]. The Maenads were temporarily quelled by [[List_of_Xanth_characters#Grey|Magician Grey]] as his talent is nullification of magic. In combination with a large python protecting the Oracle's Cave, the Maenads presence is to protect [[Geography_of_Xanth#Mount_Parnassus|Mount Parnassus]] (see "[[Man from Mundania]]").

Maenads are the adopted symbol of [[Tetovo]] in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], depicted prominently of the city's [[coat of arms]]. The inclusion of maenad imagery dates to 1932, when a small statuette of a maenad, dating to the 6th-century BC, was found in the city.  The "Tetovo Maenad" was featured on the reverse of a Macedonian 5000 [[Macedonian denar|denar]] banknote issued in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbrm.gov.mk National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia].

In ''[[The Sandman: Fables &amp; Reflections|Fables &amp; Reflections]]'', the seventh volume of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s comic series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', the maenads feature in the story ''Orpheus'', in which they gruesomely murder [[Orpheus|the titular character]] after he refuses to cavort with them (echoing the events of the actual Greek myth of Orpheus).

The laughing bacchante turns her head to the left. She wears grape leaves in her hair, which is coiled in back and falls in tresses over her shoulders. This ivory sculpture and others like it in marble and ivory were displayed in Paris.  [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]

In the horror novel ''Dominion'' by [[Bentley Little]], maenads are eventually revealed as the main antagonists for the first half of the story, during which they tear their victims to shreds and conspire to reawaken Dionysus.

[[Image:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Bacchante (1894).jpg|thumb|150px|[[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], ''Bacchante''.]]

[[Charlaine Harris]]' ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries]]'' series of novels and its television adaptation, the [[HBO]] series ''[[True Blood]]'' ([[True Blood (season 2)|2nd season]], aired in summer 2009), feature maenads in the characters of Callisto and her television representation, [[List of True Blood characters#Maryann_Forrester|Maryann]], respectively. In the show, Maryann wishes to sacrifice [[Sam Merlotte]] in hopes of summoning her god, [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News/True-Blood-Forbes-1007953.aspx TVguide.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In the TV series, Maryann is portrayed by [[Michelle Forbes]]. 

The ''[[Buffy novels|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' novel ''[[Go Ask Malice: A Slayer's Diary]]'' depicts maenads as corrupted human beings in service of the ancient and powerful Greek vampire Kakistos.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, J. Michael, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0U9KUKe_TpQC&amp;printsec=frontcove ''Found in translation: Greek drama in English''], Cambridge University Press, 2006.

The Maenads appear in [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[The Demigod Diaries]]'', where they are the principal enemies in the story "Leo Valdez and the Quest for Buford". While looking for the automaton table, Buford, Leo, Jason, and Piper run into the Maenads, who are searching for Dionysus. They chase Leo and Piper into Bunker 9, and are subsequently captured in a golden net.

Maenads appear in the ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' manga by [[Naoko Takeuchi]] as two priestesses guarding the shrine of Elysion in the Golden Kingdom of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Takeuchi|first=Naoko|title=Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Volume 14|chapter= Act 40|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|date=March 6, 1996|isbn=978-4-06-178826-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maenads also appear in "A Girl By Any Other Name", an episode of ''[[Atlantis (TV series)|Atlantis]]''.

The Japanese cosmetics company [[Nippon Menard Cosmetic Co.]] is named after them.

The short story [[The_Dresden_Files_short_fiction#Last_Call|Last Call]] of [[Jim Butcher]]'s [[The Dresden Files]] features a maenad as a primary antagonist.

Marilyn A. Brown is an [[United_States|American]] [[geographer]] and a Regent's Professor at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. From 2010-2017 she served two terms as a Presidential appointee and regulator on the board of directors of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], the nation’s largest public power provider, chairing the Nuclear Oversight Committee and modeling energy efficiency as a virtual power plant. She joined Georgia Tech in 2006 after a distinguished career at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL), where she held various leadership positions managing programs focused on [[Electrical efficiency|energy efficiency]], [[renewable energy]], and the [[Electrical_grid|electric grid]]. At ORNL, Dr. Brown co-led the report, Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future, which remains a cornerstone of engineering-economic analysis of low-carbon energy options for the United States. While at ORNL, she and Eric Hirst coined the term "[[energy efficiency gap]]" in a 1990 article on "Closing the Efficiency Gap: Barriers to the Efficient Use of Energy." The term refers to the unexploited economic potential for energy efficiency, and it has attracted wide attention among energy analysts.

Marilyn Brown is a national leader in the analysis and interpretation of energy futures in the United States. Her work has had significant visibility in the policy arena as evidenced by her briefings and testimonies before Committees of the [[United_States_House_of_Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and the [[United_States_Senate|U.S. Senate]].

Her research focuses on the design and modeling of energy and climate policies, with an emphasis on the electric utility industry, energy efficiency, and resources on the customer side of the meter. Her most recent books include Fact and Fiction in Global Energy Policy (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2016) and Green Savings: How Policies and Markets Drive Energy Efficiency (Praeger, 2015). She has authored more than 250 publications. Her work has had significant visibility in the policy arena as evidenced by her numerous briefings and testimonies before state legislative and regulatory bodies, Committees of both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, and international organizations.

At Georgia Tech, Dr. Brown created and leads the [http://cepl.gatech.edu Climate and Energy Policy Laboratory] (CEPL), and advises students in the Environment and Energy Policy concentration in the [https://spp.gatech.edu/ School of Public Policy]. CEPL supports this effort by conducting research on global energy security, clean energy employment, policies to promote energy efficiency, renewable energy policies and trends in the U.S. South, smart grid policies, and demand response. CEPL is involved in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and policy interests span the triad of climate mitigation, climate adaptation, and geo-engineering. Dr. Brown is a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, 2007, for co-authorship of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group III Assessment Report on Mitigation of Climate Change, Chapter 6. 

CEPL is distinct in its analysis of climate change and energy policies using the [[National Energy Modeling System]] (NEMS), in conjunction with Input/Output analysis, fixed- and random-effects econometric analysis, and Monte Carlo methods to characterize uncertainties. These models are used to evaluate the speed and market penetration of new and improved energy technologies, and the ability of possible future policies to accelerate technology adoption.

Dr. Brown co-founded the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance and chaired its board of directors for several years. She has served on the boards of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and the Alliance to Save Energy, and was a commissioner with the [[Bipartisan Policy Center]]. She has served on eight National Academies committees and currently serves on the editorial boards of three journals:  [[Energy_Policy_(journal)|Energy Policy]], Energy Efficiency, and [[Energy Research &amp; Social Science|Energy Research and Social Science]]. She currently serves on DOE’s Electricity Advisory Committee, where she is vice chair of the Smart Grid Subcommittee.

{{nihongo|'''Mount Haku'''|白山|Haku-san|extra="White Mountain"}}, or '''Mount Hakusan''' (commonly referred to as simply Hakusan), is a [[dormant volcano]]. The [[stratovolcano]] is located on the borders of [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]] and [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]]  (which are in Honshu) prefectures in [[Japan]]. It is thought{{fact|date=September 2017}} to have first been active 300,000 to 400,000 years ago, with the most recent eruption occurring in 1659. Along with [[Mount Tate]] and [[Mount Fuji]], it is one of Japan's {{Nihongo|"[[Three Holy Mountains]]"|三霊山|Sanreizan}}.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

==Outline==
The mountain's tallest peak, Gozengamine (御前峰), is the one that gives the mountain its height of {{Convert|2702|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Along with Kengamine (剣ヶ峰), which is {{Convert|2677|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and Ōnanjimine (大汝峰), which is {{Convert|2648|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the three peaks are considered "Mount Haku's Three Peaks" (白山三峰 ''Hakusan Sanmine''). [[Mount Bessan]] and [[Mount Sannomine]] are sometimes included and called "Mount Haku's Five Peaks".

Because it is very prominent and clearly visible from the nearby coast, even after the surrounding mountains have lost their snow, Mount Haku still appears white, which is one explanation for the mountain's name, which means "white mountain." It is also the westernmost mountain in Japan that is over {{Convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height.

==History and culture==
[[Taichō]] was the first to climb Mount Haku in 717. For hundreds of years, people have come to Haku for prayers (白山信仰 ''Hakusan Shinkō''). A branch shrine of [[Shirayama Hime Shrine]], which served as the [[Ichinomiya (disambiguation)|supreme shrine]] for [[Kaga Province]], is on the mountain. The Shirayama Hime Shrine is the {{nihongo|main shrine|総本社|sō-honsha}} of approximately 2,000 {{nihongo|Hakusan shrines|白山神社|Hakusan jinja}} in Japan. In 1980 an area of 48,000 [[Hectare|ha]] was designated a [[UNESCO]] [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|Man and the Biosphere Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=JPN+01&amp;mode=all |title=Biosphere Reserve Information - Mount Hakusan |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
Mount Haku was designated as a [[List of national parks of Japan#Quasi-National Parks|quasi-national park]] in 1955. It became a [[national park]] in 1962&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=JPN+01&amp;mode=all UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Information: Mount Hakusan]. UNESCO. Accessed May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and was renamed [[Hakusan National Park]]. Because the central part of the mountain has much precipitous terrain, there are very few roads and, as a result, little human intrusion into the area. Also limiting human intrusion is the designation of the park as a [[Wildlife Protection Areas in Japan|Wildlife Protection Area]], covering over 38,061&amp;nbsp;[[hectare|ha]]. The park stretches beyond the mountain's borders into [[Toyama Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

===Geological features===
The area surrounding Mount Haku is one of the few in Japan that contains [[outcrop]]pings from the [[Jurassic]] period of the [[Mesozoic]] era. Many of Japan's typical examples of [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s were found in this area. One of the major rock outcrops is in the Kuwashima area and is known as the "Kuwashima Fossil Wall" (桑島化石壁 ''Kuwashima Kasekikabe'').

Because the mountain is a dormant volcano, it is well known for its many [[onsen]].

===Flora===
Mount Haku is known for its diverse plant life. Along the Sabō Trail, after passing the Jinnosuke Lodge, [[alpine plant]]s are found, including the [[Fritillaria camschatcensis|chocolate lily]], which is Ishikawa's prefectural plant.

There are many alpine plants which have ''Hakusan'' in their name. These include [[Primula|Primula cuneifolia]] (''Hakusan Kozakura''), [[Anemone narcissiflora]] (''Hakusan Ichige''), [[Dactylorhiza aristata|Dactylorhiza]] (''Hakusan Chidori''), [[Geranium|Geranium yesoemse]] (''Hakusan Fuuro'') and [[Rhododendron|Rhododendron brachycarpum]] (''Hakusan Shakunage''). These plants can be found on many mountains throughout Japan, but they were first discovered and named along the older hiking trails leading to Hakusan Shrine.

===Fauna===
The [[golden eagle]], Ishikawa's prefectural bird, lives on the slopes of Mount Haku. The [[rock ptarmigan]], Gifu's prefectural bird,&lt;ref name="symguide"&gt;[http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/pref/s11111/english/eng2007-1.pdf A Statistical Guide to Gifu Prefecture 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325083413/http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/pref/s11111/english/eng2007-1.pdf |date=2009-03-25 }}. Gifu Prefecture. Accessed May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; used to live on the slopes as well. During the [[Meiji period]], the entire population of ptarmigan on the mountain disappeared; however, sightings of the [[grouse]] have recently been recorded by local residents.

==Hiking trails==
The three most used hiking trails are the Kankō Trail (観光新道 ''Kankō Shinmichi''), the Sabō Trail (砂防新道 ''Sabō Shinmichi'') and the Hirase Trail (平瀬道 ''Hirase-dō''). Both the Kankō Trail and the Sabō trail originate in the city of [[Hakusan, Ishikawa|Hakusan]], Ishikawa Prefecture, but the Hirase Trail starts from the Ōshirakawa Dam (大白川ダム) in Gifu Prefecture.

Because the area is protected as a national park, very few trails have been made on the mountain. Though the trails listed above are easy enough to hike up and down in one day, other trails can take two or three days because of the uncleared trails and rough terrain.

'''Mount Meru''' (also '''Sumeru''' ([[Sanskrit]]) or '''Sineru''' ([[Pāli]]) or [[Kangrinboqe]]) is the name of the central world-mountain in [[Buddhist cosmology]].  Etymologically, the proper name of the mountain is '''[[Mount Meru|Meru]]''' (Pāli '''Meru'''), to which is added the approbatory prefix '''su-''', resulting in the meaning "excellent Meru" or "wonderful Meru".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52430713|title=The circle of bliss : Buddhist meditational art|last=C.|first=Huntington, John|date=2003|publisher=Serindia Publications|others=Bangdel, Dina., Thurman, Robert A. F., Los Angeles County Museum of Art., Columbus Museum of Art.|isbn=1932476016|location=Chicago|oclc=52430713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Sumeru is closely related to the central [[Mount Meru]] of Hindu cosmology, but it differs from the Hindu concept in several particulars.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Cosmological Mandala with Mount Meru.jpg|thumb| Yuan dynasty 1271–1368) Chinese mandala depicting Mount Meru as an inverted pyramid topped by a lotus.]]
According to [[Vasubandhu]]'s ''{{IAST|Abhidharmakośabhāṣyam}} (philosophical writings)'', Sumeru is 80,000 ''[[yojana]]s'' tall.  The exact measure of one ''yojana'' is uncertain, but some accounts put it at about 24,000 feet, or approximately 4-1/2 miles, but other accounts put it at about 7-9 miles. It also descends beneath the surface of the surrounding waters to a depth of 80,000 yojanas, being founded upon the basal layer of Earth.  Sumeru is often used as a simile for both size and stability in Buddhist texts.

Sumeru is said to be shaped like an hourglass, with a top and base of 80,000 yojanas square, but narrowing in the middle (i.e., at a height of 40,000 yojanas) to 20,000 yojanas square.

Sumeru is the polar center of a [[mandala]]-like complex of seas and mountains.  The square base of Sumeru is surrounded by a square moat-like ocean, which is in turn surrounded by a ring (or rather square) wall of mountains, which is in turn surrounded by a sea, each diminishing in width and height from the one closer to Sumeru. There are seven seas and seven surrounding mountain-walls, until one comes to the vast outer sea which forms most of the surface of the world, in which the known continents are merely small islands.  The known world, which is on the continent of [[Jambudvipa]], is directly south of Sumeru.

The dimensions stated in the ''{{IAST|Abhidharmakośabhāṣyam}}'' are shown in the table below:

The 80,000 yojana square top of Sumeru constitutes the [[Trayastrimsa|{{IAST|Trāyastriṃśa}}]] "heaven" (devaloka), which is the highest plane in direct physical contact with the earth.  The next 40,000 yojanas below this heaven consist of sheer precipice, narrowing in like an inverted mountain until it is 20,000 yojanas square at a heigh of 40,000 yojanas above the sea.

From this point Sumeru expands again, going down in four terraced ledges, each broader than the one above.  The first terrace constitutes the "heaven" of the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Four Great Kings]] and is divided into four parts, facing north, south, east and west.  Each section is governed by one of the Four Great Kings, who faces outward toward the quarter of the world that he supervises.

40,000 yojanas is also the height at which the Sun and Moon circle Sumeru in a clockwise direction.   This rotation explains the alteration of day and night; when the Sun is north of Sumeru, the shadow of the mountain is cast over the continent of Jambudvīpa, and it is night there; at the same time it is noon in the opposing northern continent of Uttarakuru, dawn in the eastern continent of Pūrvavideha, and dusk in the western continent of Aparagodānīya.  Half a day later, when the Sun has moved to the south, it is noon in Jambudvīpa, dusk in Pūrvavideha, dawn in Aparagodānīya, and midnight in Uttarakuru.

The next three terraces down the slopes of Sumeru are each longer and broader by a factor of two.  They contain the followers of the Four Great Kings, namely [[naga (mythology)|nāgas]], [[yaksha|{{IAST|yakṣas}}]], [[gandharva]]s, and [[kumbhanda|{{IAST|kumbhāṇḍas}}]]. 

The names and dimensions of the terraces on the lower slopes of Sumeru are given below:

[[File:2003-11-27 Northerner boots in mud.jpg|thumb|300px|A pair of muddy [[boots]]]]
'''Mud''' is a liquid or semi-liquid mixture of [[water]] and any combination of different kinds of [[soil]] ([[loam]], [[silt]], and [[clay]]). It usually forms after rainfall or near water sources. Ancient mud deposits harden over geological time to form sedimentary rock such as [[shale]] or [[mudstone]] (generally called [[lutite]]s). When geological deposits of mud are formed in [[estuaries]], the resultant layers are termed [[bay mud]]s.

== Building and construction ==
[[File:Punjabi Home.JPG|thumb|250|Mud plastered home in Pakistan]]
[[File:Fortaleza de Bam, Irán, 2016-09-23, DD 09.jpg|thumb|[[Arg e Bam]], One of The largest adobe and mud building in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1208|title=Bam and its Cultural Landscape|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Adhesive ===
In the [[construction]] industry, mud is a semi-fluid material that can be used to coat, seal, or adhere materials. Depending on the composition of the mud, it can be referred by many different names, including [[slurry]], [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]], [[plaster]], [[stucco]], and [[concrete]].

=== Material ===
Mud, [[Cob (material)|cob]], [[adobe]], [[clay]], and many other names are historically used synonymously to mean a mixture of [[subsoil]] and water possibly with the addition of stones, gravel, straw, lime, and/or bitumen. This material was used a variety of ways to build walls, floors and even roofs. For thousands of years it was common in most parts of the world to build walls using [[mudbrick]]s or the [[wattle and daub]], [[rammed earth]] or [[cob (material)|cob]] techniques and cover the surfaces with [[earthen plaster]].

==== Mudbrick ====
{{Main|Mudbrick}}
[[File:Amran.jpg|right|thumb|Mud house in Amran, [[Yemen]]]]
Mud can be made into mud bricks, also called [[adobe]], by mixing mud with water, placing the mixture into [[molding (process)|moulds]] and then allowing it to dry in open air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourhome.gov.au/materials/mud-brick|title=Mud brick|first=|last=admin_666|date=29 July 2013|work=yourhome.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straw is sometimes used as a binder within the bricks, as it adds a support lattice. When the brick would otherwise break, the straw will redistribute the force throughout the brick, decreasing the chance of breakage.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. ''The Cobber’s Companion: How to Build Your Own Earthen Home''. Cottage Grove: Cob Cottage, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Such buildings must be protected from groundwater, usually by building upon a masonry, fired brick, rock or rubble foundation, and also from wind-driven rain in damp climates, usually by deep roof overhangs. In extremely dry climates a well drained flat roof may be protected with a well-prepared ([[Puddling (engineering)|puddled]]) and properly maintained dried mud coating, viable as the mud will expand when moistened and so become more water resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/5-adobe-buildings.htm|title=Preservation Brief 5: Preservation of Historic Adobe Buildings|work=nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe mudbricks were commonly used by the [[Pueblo]] Indians to build their homes and other necessary structures.

==== Fired brick ====
Mud that is mostly clay, or a mixture of clay and sand may be used for [[ceramic]]s, of which one form is the common fired [[brick]]. Fired brick are more durable but consume much more energy to produce.

==== Stabilized mud ====
Stabilized mud (earth, soil) is mud which has had a binder such as cement or bitumen added. Examples are [[mudcrete]], landcrete, and [[soil cement]].

== Pottery ==
{{Main|Pottery}}

Pottery is made by forming a [[List of pottery terms#Clay body|clay body]] into objects of a required shape and heating them to high temperatures in a [[kiln]] which removes all the water from the [[clay]], which induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing their strength and hardening and setting their shape. A clay body can be [[Pottery#Decorating and glazing|decorated]] before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. [[List of pottery terms#K|Kneading]] helps to ensure an even moisture content throughout the body. Air trapped within the clay body needs to be removed. This is called de-airing and can be accomplished by a machine called a vacuum [[List of pottery terms#pug|pug]] or manually by [[List of pottery terms#W|wedging]]. Wedging can also help produce an even moisture content. Once a clay body has been kneaded and de-aired or wedged, it is shaped by a variety of techniques. After shaping it is dried and then fired.

In ceramics, the making of liquid mud (called [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]]) is a stage in the process of refinement of the materials, since larger particles will settle from the liquid.

== Habitat ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

=== Land ===
Mud can provide a home for numerous types of animals, including varieties of [[worm]]s, [[frog]]s, [[snail]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[crayfish]]. Other animals, such as [[hippopotamus]]es, [[pig]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[water buffalo]] and [[elephant]]s, bathe in mud in order to cool off and protect themselves from the [[sun]]. Submerged mud can be home to [[larvae]] of various [[insects]].

=== Marine life ===
Mud plays an important role in the [[marine ecosystem]]. The activities of burrowing animals and fish have a dramatic churning effect on muddy seabeds. This allows the exchange and cycling of oxygen, nutrients, and minerals between water and sediment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;A summary of the ‘Burrowed Mud’ MPA search feature. (n.d.). Retrieved January 13, 2015, from http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4-c-IWKEf1kJ:www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0039/00394205.doc &amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the surface, the burrows of some species form intricate lattice-like networks and may penetrate a meter or more downwards. This means that the burrowed mud is a productive habitat, providing food and shelter for a wide range of mud-dwellers and other animals that forage in and over the mud.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Problems ==
[[File:Glenwood mud slide (6089986106).jpg|thumb|A landslide on a railroad]]
Mud can pose problems for motor traffic when moisture is present, because every vehicle function that changes direction or speed relies on friction between the tires and the road surface, so a layer of mud on the surface of the road or tires can cause the vehicle to [[Aquaplaning|hydroplane]].

Heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or high levels of ground water may trigger a movement of soil or sediments, possibly causing [[mudslides]], [[landslides]], [[rockslide|avalanches]], or [[sinkholes]].

Mudslides in volcanic terrain (called [[lahar]]s) occur after eruptions as rain remobilizes loose ash deposits.&lt;ref&gt;"Mud on the Move." Earth: The Definitive Visual Guide. London: Dorling Kindersley, 2013. 98. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mudslides]] are also common in the western United States during [[El Niño]] years due to prolonged rainfall.

== As food ==
[[File:Pohnpeian kava (32834047675).jpg|thumb|A bowl of [[kava]] tea.]]
There are numerous [[dysphemism]]s for poor-tasting food such as "tastes like dirt". [[Kava]] tea is often described this way, as it is bitter, brown, and contains sediments. 

There also exist children's recipes for "mud", which is generally a chocolate or cornstarch-based sludge used more for visual appeal than actual taste. Never does this confectionery mud actually contain real mud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookadvice.com/recipes/magic_mud-36597-recipe.htm |title=Magic mud food recipe – Magic mud ingredients &amp; cooking | publisher=Cookadvice.com | date=2 September 2012 | accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geophagia===
{{main|Geophagia}}
The practice of eating earth or soil-like substances is geophagia.

== Recreation ==

=== Mud bath ===
{{Main|Mud bath}}
A mud bath is a bath of mud, commonly from areas where hot spring water can combine with volcanic ash. Mud baths have existed for thousands of years, and can be found now in high-end spas in many countries of the world.

=== Mud wallow ===

Mud wallows are a common source of entertainment for kids. Mud wallows can be any shape, size, depth and some can have water as well as mud. Usually wallows are shallow dips in the ground that have been flooded and were full of dirt and those two have mixed to make a squishy mud wallow.

=== Mudding ===
{{Main|Mud bogging}}
Mud bogging is a form of off-road motorsport popular in Canada and the United States in which the goal is to drive a vehicle through a pit of mud or a track of a set length. Winners are determined by the distance traveled through the pit. However, if several vehicles are able to travel the entire length, the time taken to traverse the pit will determine the winner.

=== Mud run ===
Mud runs are a popular activity involving mud.  Participants run a distance of 3 miles to as long as 10 miles, while crawling through mud bogs, and battling other obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toughmudder.com|title=Mud Run – Obstacle Races – Tough Mudder|work=Tough Mudder|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerebrun.com|title=Cerebrun – Get Mental|work=Cerebrun|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warriordash.com|title=Warrior Dash – The World's Largest Obstacle Race Series|work=Warrior Dash|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
* Mud is used in mud wrestling as a form of entertainment.
* Mud can be used in a [[dunk tank]].
* [[Dirt biking]] involves biking through muddy tracks and courses.
* [[Baseball Rubbing Mud]] is used to remove the sheen from new baseballs.
* Children often like to make 'mud pies', throw mud at each other and play barefoot and cover their bare feet in mud and/or coat themselves in mud.
* [[Albuquerque]] and other towns across the United States such as [[Gillette, Wyoming]] hold a yearly event in which participants play volleyball in a giant mud pit.

The '''national parks of Scotland''' are managed areas of outstanding [[landscape]] where some forms of development are restricted to preserve the landscape and natural environment. At present, Scotland has two [[national parks]]: [[Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park]], created in 2002, and the [[Cairngorms National Park]], created in 2003.&lt;ref name=snh&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snh1wfthjxuubf.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/professional-advice/safeguarding-protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/national-designations/national-park |title=National Park|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|date= 2017|accessdate=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the national parks of many other countries, the national parks of Scotland are not areas of uninhabited land owned by the state. The majority of the land is in the ownership of private landowners (including conservation bodies such as the [[National Trust for Scotland]]), and people continue to live and work in the parks.  Although the landscapes often appear "wild" in character,  the land is not [[wilderness area|wilderness]], as it has been worked by humans for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=wildness&gt;{{cite web||url=https://www.nature.scot/sites/default/files/2017-06/A150654%20-%20policy%20statement%200203-%20wildness%20in%20Scotland%27s%20countryside%20-%202003.pdf|title=Wildness in Scotland's Countryside|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|accessdate=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like their English and Welsh counterparts the national parks of Scotland are effectively "managed landscapes", and are classified as [[IUCN]] Category V Protected Landscapes because of this. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/students/whatisanationalpark/nationalparksareprotectedareas/iucncategories|title=The IUCN Categories|publisher=National Parks UK|date= 2017|accessdate=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; National parks are only one of a [[Protected areas of Scotland|number of designations]] used to protect and conserve the landscape and natural environment of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

Public acccess to all land in Scotland is governed by the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], which grants the public a [[freedom to roam|right of responsible access]] to most land (and water) for activities such as [[hiking|walking]], [[camping]], [[cycling]], [[canoeing]], [[swimming]] and [[climbing]]; this right applies to land regardless of ownership or whether or not it is in a national park, providing it is exercised responsibly (as defined by the [[Scottish Outdoor Access Code]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outdooraccess-scotland.com/sites/default/files//docs/Scottish_Outdoor_Access_Code_-_Part_1_Introduction.pdf|title=Scottish Outdoor Access Code|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|date= 2005|accessdate=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Loch Morlich.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Loch Morlich]] in the [[Cairngorms National Park]].]]
The concept of national parks was [[History of the National Park Service|first proposed in the United States]] in the 1860s, where [[national park]]s were established to protect [[wilderness]] areas such as [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Parks: Shaping the System; Harpers Ferry Center; U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish-born [[John Muir]] was early advocate for the preservation of wilderness in the United States, and is acknowledged as a leading figure in the formation of national parks in the US, as well as the conservation movement at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Barbara Kiely|title=John Muir|publisher=Gareth Stevens|year=2008|page=10|isbn=0836883187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other countries have since gone on to form national parks on the basis of setting aside areas of wilderness. Scotland however, lacks any such areas, as thousands of years of human activity have altered the landscape. Human settlement and activity, including [[agriculture]], historical [[deforestation]], [[overgrazing]] by [[sheep]] and [[deer]], and extensive 20th century [[afforestation]] with [[Exotic species|introduced]] tree species (particularly [[conifer]]s) have resulted in landscapes which are semi-natural.&lt;ref name="wildness"/&gt;

Nonetheless, the idea that areas of wild or remote character should be designated to protect the environment and encourage public access grew in popularity throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  In 1931 a commission headed by [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Christopher Addison]] proposed the creation of a national park in the Cairngorms,&lt;ref name = snh-history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snh.org.uk/strategy/natparks/sr-npc02g.asp|title=Brief History of National Parks Proposals|publisher=SNH|accessdate=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside proposals for parks in England and Wales. Following the [[second world war]], the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] passed the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]], which led to the creation of 10 national parks in England and Wales between 1951 and 1957. No parks were created in Scotland, however a committee, chaired by Sir Douglas Ramsay, was established to consider the issue of national parks in Scotland.  The report, published in 1945 proposed national parks in  five areas: Loch Lomond &amp; the Trossachs, the Cairngorms, Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount, Wester Ross and Glen Strathfarrar-Glen Affric-Glen Cannich.&lt;ref name=cairngom-history&gt;{{cite web||url=http://cairngormslearningzone.co.uk/managing-the-park/the-national-park-family/history-leading-to-the-cairngorms-national-park/|title=History Leading to the Cairngorms National Park|publisher=Cairngorms National Park Authority| |accessdate=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government designated these areas as "National Park Direction Areas", giving powers for planning decisions taken by local authorities to be reviewed by central government, however the areas were not given full national park status.&lt;ref name="snh-history"/&gt; In 1981 the direction areas were replaced by [[National Scenic Area (Scotland)|national scenic areas]], of which there are now 40. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||url=https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/safeguarding-protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/national-designations/national-scenic-areas/|title=National Scenic Areas|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the national scenic area designation provided a degree of additional protection via the planning process, there are no bodies equivalent to a [[national park authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/safeguarding-protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/national-designations/national-scenic-areas/development-management-and|title=Development management and National Scenic Areas|publisher=SNH|date=2017|accessdate=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whilst [[Subdivisions of Scotland|local authorities]] can produce a management strategy for each one, only the three national scenic areas within [[Dumfries and Galloway]] have current management strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dumgal.gov.uk/article/15974/National-Scenic-Areas-NSAs|title=National Scenic Areas (NSAs)|publisher=Dumfries and Galloway council|date=2017-12-08|accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1974 report by the [[Countryside Commission for Scotland]] (CCS) entitled ''A Park System for Scotland'' did not explicitly recommend that national parks be established in Scotland, noting only that the issue would “no doubt continue to be debated”.&lt;ref name="unfinished"/&gt; A further CCS report into protection of the landscape of Scotland, ''The Mountain Areas of Scotland - Conservation and Management'', was published in 1990. It recommended that four areas were under such pressure that they ought to be designated as national parks, each with an independent planning board, in order to retain their heritage value. The four areas identified were similar to those proposed by the Ramsay Committee: Loch Lomond &amp; the Trossachs, the Cairngorms, Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount and Wester Ross, although Wester Ross was not considered to require a dedicated planning body.&lt;ref name="unfinished"/&gt;

Despite this long history of recommendations that national parks be established in Scotland, no action was taken until the [[Scotland Act 1998|establishment]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1999. The two current parks were designated as such under the [[National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000]], which was one of the first pieces of legislation to be passed by the Parliament. Since the original creation of the first two national parks, no further parks have been created, although the Cairngorms National Park was extended in 2010 to include the highland portion of [[Perthshire]].&lt;ref name="cairngom-history"/&gt; In 2011 the Scottish Government rejected a proposal to create a national park on the Isle of Harris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/National-Park-status-for-Harris.6698742.jp |title=National Park status for Harris rejected but locals vow to fight on - News |publisher=Scotsman.com |date=2011-01-21 |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the Scottish Campaign for National Parks proposed seven areas deemed suitable for national park status:&lt;ref name=unfinished&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scnp.org.uk/News/Docs/2013/Unfinished-Business-a-national-parks-strategy-for-scotland.pdf |title=Unfinished Business a national parks strategy for scotland|publisher=Scottish Campaign for National Parks|date=March 2013|accessdate=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016 [[Roseanna Cunningham]], the [[Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform]] told the [[Scottish Parliament]] that the Government had no plans to designate new national parks in Scotland and instead planned to focus on the two existing national parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dgwgo.com/dumfries-galloway-news/scottish-government-short-sighted-over-snub-to-national-park-for-galloway/ |title=Scottish Government “short sighted” over snub to national park for Galloway|publisher=Dumfries and Galloway - What's Going On  |date=2016-09-16|accessdate=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, there are active campaigns proposing the creation of national parks in Galloway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gallowaynationalpark.org/ |title=Galloway National Park Association|publisher=Galloway National Park Association |accessdate=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish Borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borders-national-park.scot/|title=Campaign for a Scottish Borders National Park|publisher=Campaign for a Scottish Borders National Park |accessdate=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the area proposed for the Borders park is broadly similar to the Cheviot Hills park proposed by the Scottish Campaign for National Parks.

===Marine national parks===
In June 2005, the [[Scottish Executive]] announced their intention to create Scotland’s first [[coast]]al and [[marine national park]]. Five possible locations for this were considered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snh1wfthjxuubf.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/2017-07/Publication%202006%20-%20SNH%20Advice%20on%20Coastal%20and%20Marine%20National%20Parks.pdf|title=SNH Advice on Coastal and Marine National Parks |publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|date= 2017|accessdate=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; however no marine park has been established as of 2018.&lt;ref name="snh"/&gt;

==Organisation==
[[Image:Loch Katrine.jpg|thumb|350px|Looking eastwards along [[Loch Katrine]] in the [[Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park]].]]
Each national park in Scotland is administered by a [[national park authority]]. Under the [[National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000]], national parks in Scotland have four aims:&lt;ref name="snh"/&gt;
#To conserve and enhance the natural and cultural heritage of the area
#To promote [[sustainable use]] of the [[natural resources]] of the area
#To promote understanding and enjoyment (including enjoyment in the form of recreation) of the special qualities of the area by the public
#To promote [[sustainable economic development|sustainable economic]] and social development of the area's communities

The first two of this aims are identical to those included in the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]] legislation that governs national parks in England and Wales, however the Scottish national parks have two additional aims (3 and 4 above).  The general purpose of the national park authority, as defined in the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, is to ensure that these aims are "collectively achieved ...in a coordinated way".  Although the four aims have equal status, in accordance with the [[Sandford Principle]], the first aim (conservation and enhancement of the natural and cultural heritage) is to be given greater weight when it appears to the park authority that there is irreconcilable conflict with the other aims.&lt;ref name="snh"/&gt;  

A key function of the authority relates to planning permission: in this respect the two current Scottish parks differ.  The Loch Lomond and The Trossachs national park is a full planning authority, exercising powers that would otherwise be exercised by the [[local government in Scotland|local authority]], whilst the Cairngorms national park has the power to "call in" planning decisions from the local authority where they are considered to conflict with the aims of the park.&lt;ref name = govern&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scnp.org.uk/News/Docs/2015/SCNP-Report2-Possible-Governance-Models.pdf|title=Future National Parks in Scotland: Possible Governence Models|publisher=Scottish Campaign for National Parks|date=August 2015|accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  National park authorities are also required to take the responsibility for managing access to the countryside that elsewhere falls to local authorities.&lt;ref name = galloway&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gallowaynationalpark.org/s/Report_Web.pdf|title=A National Park in Galloway? A Discussion Paper |publisher=Galloway National Park Association |date= October 2017|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the planning and access function, national parks authorities have considerable flexibility as to how the four aims are achieved.  They can, for example, acquire land, make byelaws and management agreements, provide grants, offer advice, and undertake or commission research.&lt;ref = name = "galloway"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The national park authority is run by a board, consisting of members elected by the community living with the park, members from the [[Subdivisions_of_Scotland#Council_areas|local authorities]] with areas in the park, and members appointed by the Scottish government. The Cairngorms national Park board has 19 members, whilst the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs national park board has 17 members (see below).&lt;ref name="snh"/&gt;

'''Neşet Suyu Nature Park''', aka '''Neşetsuyu Nature Park''', ({{lang-tr|Neşet Suyu Tabiat Parkı}} or ''Neşetsuyu Tabiat Parkı'') is a [[nature park]] located in [[Sarıyer]] district of [[Istanbul Province]], Turkey.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt; 

[[File:NeşetsuyuNaturePark (4).jpg|thumb|A view from the nature park.]]
[[File:NeşetsuyuNaturePark (2).jpg|thumb|Memorial inscription for Professor Neşet Bey inside the nature park.]]
[[File:NeşetsuyuNaturePark (5).jpg|thumb|A fountain in the park.]]

Situated {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Bahçeköy, Sarıyer|Bahçeköy]] neighborhood of Sarıyer and next to the [[Falih Rıfkı Atay Nature Park]], it covers an area of {{convert| 67.47|ha|acre|abbr=on}}. It was established in 2011, and is one of the nine nature parks inside the [[Belgrad Forest]]. The protected area is named in honor of Professor ({{lang-ota|Müderris}}) Neşet [[Bey]] (1881–1924).&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

Neşet Bey was born in [[Resen, Macedonia|Resen]], [[Ottoman Empire]], today in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], in 1881. He taught at the ({{lang-ota|Orman Mekteb-i âlîsi}}), today Forestry Faculty of [[Istanbul University]], and served as its [[rector (academia)|rector]].&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt; He was much respected for his works in forestry by his colleagues and students. A memorial [[marble]] inscription erected by the Turkish Directorate General of Forestry on September 21, 1953 is situated inside the nature park.

In the southwest of the nature park, the Büyük Bent (liaterally: Big Dam) is situated on the Kırkçeşme water canal. Remains of a [[cistern]] and the [[mihrab]] of an open-air prayer place ({{lang-tr|namazgah}}) are registered protected cultural heritage in the park area.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

In 2000, the soil in the park area, which is one of the most popular recreation places in Istanbul, was loosened up by earth movers since the soil became hardened  throughout the years like concrete endangering the trees. It was found that the growth of the tree roots stopped, bacteria and fungi population increased due to lack of oxygen in the soil. Fallen leaves could not merge with the hardened soil to make it nutrient for the vegetation. The park area was closed to picnics until 2005.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

==Ecosystem==
The nature park has rich flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

;Flora
Dominant tree species of the nature park are [[oak]] and European hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]''). Other vegetation in the area are various shrubs and bushes.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

;Fauna
There are mammals and bird species in significant numbers in the Belgrad Forest. The main fauna species of the forestry are [[wild boar]], [[golden jackal]], [[deer]], [[roe]], [[fox]], [[wolf]], [[weasel]], [[hare]], [[squirrel]], [[tortoise]] and [[hedgehog]]. As bird species observed are [[falcon]], [[hawk]], [[magpie]], [[crow]], [[woodpecker]], [[sparrow]], [[finch]] and [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]].&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

The creation of Nunavut resulted in the [[territorial evolution of Canada|first major change to Canada's political map]] since the incorporation of the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in 1949.

Nunavut comprises a major portion of [[Northern Canada]], and most of the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]]. Its vast territory makes it the [[list of the largest country subdivisions by area|fifth-largest country subdivision in the world]], as well as North America's second-largest (after [[Greenland]]). The capital [[Iqaluit]] (formerly "Frobisher Bay"), on [[Baffin Island]] in the east, was chosen by the [[Nunavut capital plebiscite, 1995|1995 capital plebiscite]]. Other major communities include the regional centres of [[Rankin Inlet]] and [[Cambridge Bay]]. 

Nunavut also includes [[Ellesmere Island]] to the far north, as well as the eastern and southern portions of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]] in the west and [[Akimiski Island]] in [[James Bay]] far to the southeast of the rest of the territory. It is Canada's only geo-political region that is not connected to the rest of North America by highway.&lt;ref name="howToGetHere"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nunavuttourism.com/planning-your-trip/how-to-get-here |title=How to Get Here |publisher=Nunavut Tourism |accessdate=June 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nunavut is the largest in area and the second-least populous of Canada's provinces and territories. One of the world's most remote, sparsely settled regions, it has a population of 35,944,&lt;ref name="census2016"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&amp;T=101&amp;SR=1&amp;S=3&amp;O=D#tPopDwell |title=Population and Dwelling Count Highlight Tables, 2016 Census |publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] |access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly [[Inuit]], spread over an area of just over {{convert|1,750,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, [[List of political and geographic subdivisions by total area in excess of 1,000,000 square kilometers|or slightly smaller than Mexico]].

==Etymology==

Nunavut means "our land" in [[Inuktitut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Origin of the names of Canada and its provinces and territories |url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography/place-names/origins-geographical-names/9224 |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |accessdate=December 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Nunavut}}
Nunavut covers {{convert|1877787|km2|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="census2016"/&gt; of land and {{convert|160935|km2|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadafaq.ca/nunavut/|title=Nunavut|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of water in Northern Canada. The territory includes part of the mainland, most of the Arctic Archipelago, and all of the islands in [[Hudson Bay]], [[James Bay]], and [[Ungava Bay]], including the [[Belcher Islands]], all of which belonged to the Northwest Territories from which Nunavut was separated. This makes it the fifth-largest subnational entity (or [[administrative division]]) in the world. If Nunavut were a country, it would rank 15th in area.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nunavut has long land borders with the Northwest Territories on the mainland and a few Arctic islands, and with [[Manitoba]] to the south of the Nunavut mainland; it also meets [[Saskatchewan]] to the southwest at a [[quadripoint]]). Through its small satellite territories in the southeast, it has short land borders with Newfoundland and Labrador on [[Killiniq Island]], with [[Ontario]] in two locations in [[James Bay]] – the larger located west of [[Akimiski Island]], and the smaller around the [[Albany River]] near Fafard Island – and with [[Quebec]] in many locations, such as near [[Eastmain]] and near [[Inukjuak]]. It also shares maritime borders with Greenland and the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba.

Nunavut's highest point is [[Barbeau Peak]] ({{convert|2616|m|abbr=on|0}}) on Ellesmere Island. The population density is 0.019&amp;nbsp;persons/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.05&amp;nbsp;persons/sq&amp;nbsp;mi), one of the lowest in the world. By comparison, [[Greenland]] has approximately the same area and nearly twice the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gl.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=CIA |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Nunavut Köppen.svg|left|thumb|Köppen climate types in Nunavut]]
Nunavut experiences a [[polar climate]] in most regions, owing to its high latitude and lower continental summertime influence than areas to the west. In more southerly continental areas very cold [[subarctic climate]]s can be found, due to July being slightly milder than the required {{convert|10|C|F}}.

==History==
{{Main|History of Nunavut}}
{{See also|Paleo-Eskimo|Pre-Dorset|Dorset culture|Thule people|Inuit}}
[[File:Eskimo Women at Ashe Inlet.jpg|thumb|Inuit women at [[Ashe Inlet]], 1884.]]
The region now known as Nunavut has supported a continuous [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population for approximately 4,000 years. Most [[historian]]s identify the coast of Baffin Island with the ''[[Helluland]]'' described in Norse [[saga]]s, so it is possible that the inhabitants of the region had occasional contact with [[Norsemen|Norse]] sailors.

=== Archaeological findings ===
In September 2008, researchers reported on the evaluation of existing and newly excavated [[archaeological]] remains, including [[yarn]] spun from a [[hare]], rats, [[tally stick]]s, a carved wooden face [[mask]] that depicts [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] features, and possible architectural material. The materials were collected in five seasons of [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] at [[Cape Tanfield]]. Scholars determined that these provide evidence of European traders and possibly settlers on [[Baffin Island]], not later than 1000 CE (and thus older than or contemporaneous with [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]). They seem to indicate prolonged contact, possibly up to 1450. The origin of the [[Old World]] contact is unclear; the article states: "Dating of some yarn and other artifacts, presumed to be left by [[Vikings]] on Baffin Island, have produced an age that predates the Vikings by several hundred years. So […] you have to consider the possibility that as remote as it may seem, these finds may represent evidence of contact with Europeans prior to the Vikings' arrival in Greenland."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunatsiaq.com/archives/2008/809/80912/news/nunavut/80912_1516.html Jane George, "Kimmirut site suggests early European contact: Hare fur yarn, wooden tally sticks may mean visitors arrived 1,000 years ago"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819090152/http://www.nunatsiaq.com/archives/2008/809/80912/news/nunavut/80912_1516.html |date=August 19, 2009 }}, ''Nunatsiaq News'', September 12, 2008.

=== First written historical accounts ===
The written historical accounts of Nunavut begin in 1576, with an account by English [[Exploration|explorer]] [[Martin Frobisher]]. While leading an expedition to find the [[Northwest Passage]], Frobisher thought he had discovered gold ore around the body of water now known as [[Frobisher Bay]] on the coast of [[Baffin Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapleleafweb.com/old/features/nunavut/intro.html "Nunavut: The Story of Canada's Inuit People"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003123506/http://www.mapleleafweb.com/old/features/nunavut/intro.html |date=October 3, 2007 }}, Maple Leaf Web&lt;/ref&gt; The ore turned out to be worthless, but Frobisher made the first recorded European contact with the [[Inuit]]. Other explorers in search of the elusive Northwest Passage followed in the 17th century, including [[Henry Hudson]], [[William Baffin]] and [[Robert Bylot]].

=== Cold War ===

=== Recent history ===
Discussions on dividing the Northwest Territories along ethnic lines began in the 1950s, and legislation to do this was introduced in 1963.  After its failure, a federal commission recommended against such a measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.gov.nt.ca/visitors/creation-new-nwt|title=Creation of a New Northwest Territories - Legislative Assembly of The Northwest Territories|website=www.assembly.gov.nt.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1976, as part of the land claims negotiations between the [[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami]] (then called the "Inuit Tapirisat of Canada") and the [[Government of Canada|federal government]], the parties discussed division of the Northwest Territories to provide a separate territory for the Inuit. On April 14, 1982, a [[Northwest Territories division plebiscite, 1982|plebiscite on division]] was held throughout the Northwest Territories. A majority of the residents voted in favour and the federal government gave a conditional agreement seven months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/~agraham/jull/buildnun.htm |title=Building Nunavut: A Story of Inuit Self-Government |author=[[Peter Jull]]|work=The Northern Review |volume=1 |date=Summer 1988 |pages=59–72|publisher=Yukon College |accessdate=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land claims agreement was completed in September 1992 and ratified by nearly 85% of the voters in Nunavut in [[Nunavut creation referendum, 1992|a referendum]]. On July 9, 1993, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act&lt;ref name=claims /&gt; and the Nunavut Act&lt;ref name=act /&gt; were passed by the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]]. The transition to establish Nunavut Territory was completed on April 1, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/provincial-territorial-politics/creation-of-nunavut/topic-creation-of-nunavut.html |authorlink=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |title=Creation of Nunavut |year=2006 |accessdate=April 26, 2007 |publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of Nunavut has been followed by growth in the capital, Iqaluit—a modest increase from 5,200 in 2001 to 6,600 in 2011.

The population growth rate of Nunavut has been well above the Canadian average for several decades, mostly due to birth rates significantly higher than the Canadian average—a trend that continues. Between 2011 and 2016, Nunavut had the highest population growth rate of any Canadian province or territory, at a rate of 12.7%.&lt;ref name="census2016"/&gt; The second-highest was Alberta, with a growth rate of 11.6%.

In his 2000 commissioned report (''Aajiiqatigiingniq Language of Instruction Research Paper'') to the Nunavut Department of Education, Ian Martin of [[York University]] stated a "long-term threat to [[Inuit languages]] from English is found everywhere, and current school language policies and practices on language are contributing to that threat" if Nunavut schools follow the Northwest Territories model. He provided a 20-year language plan to create a "fully functional bilingual society, in Inuktitut and English" by 2020. The plan provides different models, including:
* "Qulliq Model", for most Nunavut communities, with Inuktitut as the main language of instruction.
* "Inuinnaqtun Immersion Model", for language reclamation and immersion to revitalize Inuinnaqtun as a living language.

===Mining and exploration===
There are currently three major mines in operation in Nunavut.

Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd – Meadowbank Division. [[Meadowbank Gold Mine]] is an open pit [[gold]] [[gold mining|mine]] with an estimated mine life 2010–2020 and employs 680 persons.
The second recently opened mine in production is the [[Mary River Mine|Mary River Iron Ore mine]] operated by Baffinland Iron Mines. It is located close to Pond Inlet on North Baffin Island. They produce a high grade direct ship iron ore.

The most recent mine to open is Doris North or the Hope Bay Mine operated near [[Hope Bay Aerodrome]] by TMAC Resource Ltd. This new high grade gold mine is the first in a series of potential mines in gold occurrences all along the [[Hope Bay greenstone belt]].

[[File:Leg Building Iqaluit 2000-08-27.jpg|thumb|left|Legislative assembly building in [[Iqaluit]]]]

Nunavut has [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|a Commissioner]] appointed by the federal [[Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs]]. As in the other territories, the commissioner's role is symbolic and is analogous to that of a [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nellie-kusugak-named-as-new-nunavut-commissioner-1.3124575 |title=Nellie Kusugak named as new Nunavut commissioner |website=CBC News |date=June 23, 2015 |accessdate=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Commissioners of Nunavut|the Commissioner]] is not formally a representative of [[Monarchy of Canada|Canada's head of state]], a role roughly analogous to representing [[The Crown]] has accrued to the position.

Nunavut elects a single member of the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. This makes Nunavut the largest electoral district in the world by area.

The members of the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Legislative Assembly of Nunavut]] are elected individually; there are [[Non-partisan democracy|no parties]] and the legislature is [[Consensus government|consensus-based]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/provincial-territorial-politics/on-the-nunavut-campaign-trail/topic-on-the-nunavut-campaign-trail.html | author=CBC Digital Archives | authorlink= Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | title= On the Nunavut Campaign Trail | year= 2006 | accessdate=April 26, 2007 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of government, the [[premier of Nunavut]], is elected by, and from the members of the legislative assembly. On June 14, 2018, [[Joe Savikataaq]] was elected as the Premier of Nunavut, after his predecessor [[Paul Quassa]] lost a non-confidence motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/after-paul-quassa-ejected-nunavut-chooses-deputy-as-new-premier-1.3972943|title=After Paul Quassa ejected, Nunavut chooses deputy as new premier|first=Bob|last=Weber|date=June 14, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nunavut-premier-non-confidence-motion-1.4704708|title=Joe Savikataaq is the new premier of Nunavut, after non-confidence vote ousts former leader - CBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] [[Paul Okalik]] set up an advisory council of eleven elders, whose function it is to help incorporate ''"[[Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit]]"'' (Inuit culture and traditional knowledge, often referred to in English as "IQ") into the territory's political and governmental decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/30912/news/nunavut/briefs.html |title=GN appoints IQ advisory council |website=Nunatsiaq Online |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=April 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051354/http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/30912/news/nunavut/briefs.html |archive-date=April 10, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the territory's small population, and the fact that there are only a few hundred voters in each electoral district, the possibility of two election candidates finishing in an exact tie is significantly higher than in any Canadian province. This has actually happened twice in the five elections to date, with exact ties in [[Akulliq]] in the [[Nunavut general election, 2008]] and in [[Rankin Inlet South]] in the [[Nunavut general election, 2013]]. In such an event, Nunavut's practice is to schedule a follow-up [[by-election]] rather than choosing the winning candidate by an arbitrary method. The territory has also had numerous instances where MLAs were directly [[acclamation|acclaimed]] to office as the only person to register their candidacy by the deadline, as well as one instance where a follow-up by-election had to be held due to no candidates registering for the regular election in their district at all.

[[File:Map of the Nunavut regions.png|thumb|Regions of Nunavut]]
Owing to Nunavut's vast size, the stated goal of the territorial government has been to decentralize governance beyond the region's capital. Three [[List of regions of Nunavut|regions]]—[[Kitikmeot Region, Nunavut|Kitikmeot]], [[Kivalliq Region|Kivalliq]] and [[Qikiqtaaluk Region|Qikiqtaaluk/Baffin]]—are the basis for more localized administration, although they lack autonomous governments of their own.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The territory has an annual budget of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]700 million, provided almost entirely by the federal government. Former Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] designated support for Northern Canada as one of his priorities in 2004, with an extra $500 million to be divided among the three territories.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In 2001, the government of New Brunswick{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} collaborated with the federal government and the technology firm [[SSI Micro]] to launch [[Qiniq]], a unique network that uses [[satellite]] delivery to provide [[broadband Internet access]] to 24 communities in Nunavut. As a result, the territory was named one of the world's "Smart 25 Communities" in 2006 by the [[Intelligent Community Forum]], a worldwide organization that honours innovation in broadband technologies. The [[Nunavut Public Library Services]], the public library system serving the territory, also provides various information services to the territory.

In September 2012, Premier Aariak welcomed [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex]], to Nunavut as part of the events marking the [[Diamond Jubilee]] of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/prince-edward-and-wife-sophie-arrive-in-iqaluit-1.1140375 |title=Prince Edward and wife Sophie arrive in Iqaluit |date=September 13, 2012 |work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licence plates===
The [[Vehicle registration plates of Nunavut|Nunavut licence plate]] was originally created for the Northwest Territories in the 1970s. The plate has long been famous worldwide for its unique design in the shape of a [[polar bear]].

The indigenous [[music of Nunavut]] includes [[Inuit throat singing]] and drum-led dancing, along with [[country music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[square dancing]], the [[button accordion]] and the [[fiddle]], an infusion of European influence.

===Media===
The [[Inuit Broadcasting Corporation]] is based in Nunavut.  The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) serves Nunavut through a radio and television production centre in Iqaluit, and a bureau in Rankin Inlet.  The territory is also served by two regional weekly newspapers ''[[Nunatsiaq News]]'' published by Nortext and ''[[News/North|Nunavut News/North]]'', published by [[Northern News Services]], who also publish the regional ''Kivalliq News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altstuff.com/newsnu.htm |title=Newspapers in Nunavut |publisher=Altstuff.com |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadband internet is provided by [[Qiniq]] and [[Northwestel]] through Netkaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qiniq.com/ |title=Qiniq |publisher=Qiniq |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netkaster.ca/ |title=Netkaster |publisher=Netkaster.ca |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
The film production company [[Isuma]] is based in Igloolik. Co-founded by [[Zacharias Kunuk]] and [[Norman Cohn (film producer)|Norman Cohn]] in 1990, the company produced the 1999 feature ''[[Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner]]'', winner of the [[Caméra d'Or]] for Best First Feature Film at the 2001 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. It was the first feature film written, directed, and acted entirely in [[Inuktitut]].

In November 2006, the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) and the Inuit Broadcasting Corporation announced the start of the Nunavut Animation Lab, offering animation training to Nunavut artists at workshops in Iqaluit, Cape Dorset and Pangnirtung.&lt;ref name=George&gt;{{cite news|last=George|first=Jane|title=Nunavut’s getting animated|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/61103/news/nunavut/61103_06.html|accessdate=November 8, 2011|newspaper=[[Nunatsiaq News]]|date=November 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films from the Nunavut Animation Lab include [[Alethea Arnaquq-Baril]]'s 2010 digital animation short ''Lumaajuuq'', winner of the Best Aboriginal Award at the [[Golden Sheaf Awards]] and named Best Canadian Short Drama at the [[imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival]].&lt;ref name="nfb coll"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nunavut Animation Lab: Lumaajuuq|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=57615|work=Collection|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the government of Nunavut and the NFB jointly announced the launch of a DVD and online collection entitled ''[[Unikkausivut]]'' (Inuktitut: ''Sharing Our Stories''), which will make over 100 NFB films by and about [[Inuit]] available in Inuktitut, [[Inuinnaqtun]] and other Inuit languages, as well as English and French. The Government of Nunavut is distributing ''Unikkausivut'' to every school in the territory.&lt;ref name=Unikkausivut&gt;{{cite news|title=Inuit films move online and into northern communities|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2011/11/02/nfb-inuit-film-project.html|accessdate=November 5, 2011|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nunatsiaq&gt;{{cite news|title=New NFB collection includes 24 films on or by Inuit|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674new_nfb_collection_includes_24_films_on_or_by_inuit/|accessdate=November 7, 2011|newspaper=[[Nunatsiaq News]]|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performing arts===
[[Artcirq]] is a collective of [[Inuit]] [[circus]] performers based in Igloolik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2009/1222/Bringing-circus-and-new-hope-to-a-remote-Arctic-village |title=Bringing circus – and new hope – to a remote Arctic village |accessdate=December 28, 2009 |publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has performed around the world, including at the [[2010 Olympic Winter Games]] in Vancouver, British Columbia.

===Nunavummiut (notable people)===
{{Main|List of people from Nunavut}}
[[Susan Aglukark]] is an Inuit singer and songwriter. She has released six albums and has won several [[Juno Awards]]. She blends the Inuktitut and English languages with contemporary pop music arrangements to tell the stories of her people, the Inuit of Arctic.

On May 3, 2008, the [[Kronos Quartet]] premiered a collaborative piece with [[Inuit throat singing|Inuit throat singer]] [[Tanya Tagaq]], entitled ''Nunavut'', based on an Inuit folk story. Tagaq is also known internationally for her collaborations with [[Iceland]]ic pop star [[Björk]].

[[Jordin Tootoo|Jordin John Kudluk Tootoo]] (Inuktitut syllabics: ᔪᐊᑕᓐ ᑐᑐ; born February 2, 1983 in [[Churchill, Manitoba]], Canada) is a professional ice hockey player with the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). Although born in Manitoba, Tootoo grew up in Rankin Inlet, where he was taught to skate and play hockey by his father, Barney.

=== Alcohol ===
Due to prohibition laws influenced by local and traditional beliefs, Nunavut has a highly regulated alcohol market. It is the last outpost of prohibition in Canada, and it is often easier to obtain firearms than alcohol.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Iqaluit hopes to curb alcoholism and binge-drinking by opening city's first beer store in 38 years|url = http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/iqaluit-hopes-to-curb-alcoholism-and-binge-drinking-by-opening-citys-first-beer-store-in-fifteen-years|website = National Post|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every community in Nunavut has slightly differing regulations, but as a whole it is still very restrictive. Seven communities have bans against alcohol and another 14 have orders being restricted by local committees. Because of these laws, a lucrative bootlegging market has appeared where people mark up the prices of bottles by extraordinary amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhUhHbTJ_s|title=Prohibition in Northern Canada: VICE INTL (Canada)|first=|last=VICE|date=January 14, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RCMP estimate Nunavut's bootleg liquor market rakes in some $10 million a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Despite the restrictions, alcohol's availability leads to widespread alcohol related crime. One lawyer estimated some 95% of police calls are alcohol-related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Department of Justice - Legal Aid, Courtworker, and Public Legal Education and Information Needs in the Northwest Territories|url = http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/aj-ja/rr03_la8-rr03_aj8/p10.html|website = www.justice.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-23|first = Government of Canada, Department of Justice, Electronic|last = Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alcohol is also believed to be a contributing factor to the territory's high rates of violence, suicide, and homicide. A special task force created in 2010 to study and address the territory's increasing alcohol-related problems recommended the government ease alcohol restrictions. With prohibition shown to be highly ineffective historically, it is believed these laws contribute to the territory's widespread social ills. However, many residents are skeptical about the effectiveness of liquor sale liberalization and want to ban it completely. In 2014, Nunavut's government decided to move towards more legalization. A liquor store has opened in Iqaluit, the capital, for the first time in 38 years as of 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Sport===
Nunavut has competed at the [[Arctic Winter Games]] and co-hosted the [[2002 Arctic Winter Games|2002 edition]].

[[Hockey Nunavut]] was founded in 1999 and competes in the [[Maritime-Hockey North Junior C Championship]].

'''OSCAR II''' (a.k.a. [[OSCAR]] 2) is the second [[amateur radio satellite]] launched by Project OSCAR into [[Low Earth Orbit]]. OSCAR II was launched June 2, 1962 by a [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor-DM21 Agena B]] launcher from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Lompoc, California.  The satellite, a rectangular box (30 x 25 x 12&amp;nbsp;cm) weighing 10&amp;nbsp;kg, was launched as a secondary payload (ballast) for [[Corona (satellite)|Corona 43]] the fifth launch of a KH-4 satellite. 
The satellite employed a monopole transmitting antenna 60&amp;nbsp;cm long extended from the center of the convex surface, but had no attitude control system. 
OSCAR II lasted 18 days ceasing operation on June 20, 1962 and re-entered June 21, 1962.&lt;ref name="NASA Oscar 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1962-022b|title=Oscar 2 |publisher=NASA National Space Science Data Center |date=30 June 1977 |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunter Oscar 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/oscar-1.htm |title=OSCAR 2 |publisher=Gunter's Space Page |date=31 December 1999 |accessdate=14 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSCAR 2 incorporated these design changes, from the earlier [[OSCAR 1]].&lt;ref name="Gunter Oscar 2" /&gt;
* Changing the surface thermal coatings to achieve a cooler internal spacecraft environment.
* Modifying the sensing system so the satellite temperature could be measured accurately as the batteries decayed
* Lowering the transmitter power output to 100&amp;nbsp;mW to extend the life of the onboard battery.

==Project OSCAR==
Project OSCAR Inc. started in 1960 with the radio amateurs from the TRW Radio Club of Redondo Beach, California, many who worked at TRW and defense industries, to investigate the possibility of putting an amateur satellite in orbit.  OSCAR stands for Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio.
Project OSCAR was responsible for the construction of the first Amateur Radio Satellite OSCAR-1, that was successfully launched from Vandenberg AFB in California.  Mr. Projoscar at [[Foothill College]] served as the Project Manager.  OSCAR-1 orbited the earth for 22 days, transmitting the “HI” greeting in Morse Code (4 dots, then 2 dots '''.... ..'''); Project Oscar was responsible for launching 3 other amateur radio satellites during the 1960s: [[OSCAR 1]], [[OSCAR 3]], and [[OSCAR 4]].

In 1969, AMSAT-NA was founded by radio amateurs working at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and the Baltimore-Washington DC region, to continue the efforts begun by [[OSCAR|Project OSCAR]]. Its first project was to coordinate the launch of [[Australis-OSCAR 5]], constructed by students at the [[University of Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="HIST"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/AboutAmsat/amsat_history.php | title=Space Satellites from the World's Garage – The Story of AMSAT | publisher=AMSAT-NA | accessdate=14 February 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005160332/http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/AboutAmsat/amsat_history.php | archivedate=5 October 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, over fifty years later, Project OSCAR's mission is “To initiate and support activities that promote the Satellite Amateur Radio Hobby”. Our primary goal is to reach out and provide logistical support, training and in some cases equipment to amateur radio associations, schools and the public at large.

OSCAR II lasted 18 days ceasing operation on June 20, 1962 and re-entered June 21, 1962.

'''Overconsumption''' is a situation where [[resource consumption|resource use]] has outpaced the [[sustainable]] [[carrying capacity|capacity]] of the [[ecosystem]].  A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to [[environmental degradation]] and the eventual [[resource depletion|loss of resource]] bases.

Generally, the discussion of overconsumption parallels that of [[human overpopulation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul R |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704949114|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich. These drivers, all of which trace to the fiction that perpetual growth can occur on a finite planet, are themselves increasing rapidly.|pmc=5544311|pmid=28696295}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is the more people, the more [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[raw material]]s takes place to sustain their lives. But, humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource utilization) and the pollution they generate (including [[carbon footprint]]) are equally important. Currently, the inhabitants of the [[developed nation]]s of the world consume resources at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population (7.4 billion people).&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Diamond"&gt;Diamond, Jared: (2008-01-02). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02diamond.html "What's Your Consumption Factor?"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the developing world is a growing market of consumption. These nations are quickly gaining more purchasing power and it is expected that the Global South, which includes cities in Asia, Latin America and Africa, will account for 56% of consumption growth by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dobbs, James Manyika, Jonathan Woetzel, Jaana Remes, Jesko Perrey, Greg Kelly, Kanaka Pattabiraman, and Hemant Sharma. (2016, March). Urban world: The global consumers to watch. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/urbanization/urban-world-the-global-consumers-to-watch&lt;/ref&gt; This means that consumption rates will plateau for the developed nations and shift more into these developing countries. 

The theory of overpopulation reflects issues of [[Carrying capacity#Humans|carrying capacity]] without taking into account per capita consumption, by which developing nations are evaluated to consume more than their land can support. It is expected that world population growth will increase by 41% from 2000 to 2050, reaching a height of 8.9 billion people. On top of the rapid growth expectancy, it will be highly concentrated in the developing nations. This poses issues with inequality of consumption as well. The nations that will come into consumer dominance must abstain from abusing certain forms of consumption, especially energy consumption of CO2.&lt;ref&gt;RICHARD FLORIDA. (2016, April 14). Big Cities Are the Future of Global Consumption. Retrieved November 5, 2017, from https://www.citylab.com/life/2016/04/big-cities-are-the-future-of-global-consumption/478128/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green party|Green parties]] and the [[ecology movement]] often argue that consumption per person, or [[ecological footprint]], is typically lower in poor than in rich nations.

==Causes==
In understanding the effects of over-consumption, it is pertinent to understand what causes the phenomenon. There is a spectrum of goods and services that the world population constantly consume. These range from food and beverage, clothing and footwear, housing, energy, technology,  transportation, education, health and personal care, financial services and other utilities.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank Group - www.worldbank.org. (n.d.). The developing world’s 4.5 billion low-income people already a $5 trillion market. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/market&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these require a different resource and once that resource is exploited to a certain point, that qualifies as over consumption. Since the developing nations are rising quickly into the consumer class, it is important to note the trends happening in these nations. According to the World Bank, the highest shares of consumption lie in food and beverage and clothing and footwear. This applies regardless of sector of income. &lt;ref&gt;The World Bank Group - www.worldbank.org. (n.d.). The developing world’s 4.5 billion low-income people already a $5 trillion market.

Two main factors of why we buy so much and so often is due to planned and perceived obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM&lt;/ref&gt; This factor of production was introduced first in the United States and it revolves around the design of products and with these methods, the products are intentionally designed to get rid of after a short amount of time. As of 2012, only 1% of goods purchased were still in use after 6 months. This is due to planned and perceived obsolescence. When it is planned, designers create products that will not be able to work after a certain amount of time but they work for enough time to ensure the customers will come back to buy again. Perceived obsolescence comes in a lot with fashion and trends and fueled by advertising and media consumption. Through this technique, consumers are convinced that certain products do not have value anymore because it is out of style, and in order to have value, consumers must buy more up to date styles. Here is where fast fashion was born. 
As of 2015, the top five consumer markets in the world included the United States, Japan, Germany, China and France. &lt;ref&gt;The 25 Largest Consumer's Markets ... And The Outlook For 2015. (n.d.).

==Effects==
{{See also|I PAT}}
A fundamental effect of overconsumption is a reduction in the planet's [[carrying capacity]]. Excessive unsustainable consumption will exceed the long term carrying capacity of its environment ([[Overshoot (ecology)|ecological overshoot]]) and subsequent resource depletion, [[environmental degradation]] and reduced [[ecosystem health]].

Looking at the two largest sectors of over consumption, the fashion and food industries, we can see most of the harmful effects on the Earth starting here. The fashion industry has created a new venue, fast fashion, which in 2013 produced 15.1 million tons of textile waste and of that, 12.8 million tons were thrown out.  The United States, being the largest consumer market, deals with excess clothing by exporting it to poorer, developing nations but this solution is not sustainable because the demand will go down as cheap clothing becomes more readily available. Another way of disposal is to throw out into landfills or burn up in incinerators which is the least sustainable disposal solution. &lt;ref&gt;Tan, Z. Y. (2016, April 10). What Happens When Fashion Becomes Fast, Disposable And Cheap? Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.npr.org/2016/04/08/473513620/what-happens-when-fashion-becomes-fast-disposable-and-cheap
&lt;/ref&gt;

The food industry is the other largest sector of consumption and studies show that people waste a fifth of food products just through disposal or overconsumption. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization collected data and found that by the time food reaches the consumer, 9% (160 million tons) goes uneaten and 10% is lost to overconsumption - meaning consumers ate more than the calorie intake requirement. Other aspects of losses surrounding dry matter came at each stage in the food system, the highest amount being from livestock production at 43.9%, transportation accounted for 18% and consumer waste accounting for 12.2% loss. When the consumer takes in too much, this not only explains losses in the beginning of the stage at production (and over production) but also lends itself to overconsumption of energy and protein, having harmful effects on the body. &lt;ref&gt;Beer, E. (2017, February 27). Consumer waste and livestock biggest inefficiencies in food production: Study. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2017/02/27/Consumer-waste-and-livestock-biggest-inefficiencies-in-food-production-Study
&lt;/ref&gt;


The scale of modern life's overconsumption has enabled an [[overclass]] to exist, displaying  [[affluenza]] and [[obesity]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nierenberg|first1=Danielle|title=State of the World 2006: a Worldwatch Institute report on progress toward a sustainable society|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/state-of-the-world-2006-a-worldwatch-institute-report-on-progress-toward-a-sustainable-society/oclc/62865904|website=Worldcat|publisher=New York; London: W.W. Norton|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However once again both of these claims are controversial with the latter being correlated to other factors more so than over-consumption. Within the topic of overconsumption there are many other ideas that should be considered in order to find the true cause of it. Some important events that coincide are poverty, population and the development of an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overpopulation and overconsumption|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/306/6888/1285|website=BMJ|publisher=BMJ|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overconsumption can also lead to a decline in the economy and financial instability. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vidal|first1=John|title=World needs to stabilise population and cut consumption, says Royal Society|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/26/earth-population-consumption-disasters|website=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long term, these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalissues.org/EnvIssues/Population/Result.asp Effects of Over-Consumption and Increasing Populations]. 26 September 2001. Retrieved on 19 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and in the worst case a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. [[Lester Brown]] of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], has said: "It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption.  Environmentally, the world is in an overshoot mode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Lester R. |title=World on the Edge: How to Prevent Environmental and Economic Collapse |publisher=Norton |series=Earth Policy Institute |year=2011 |page=7 |isbn =113654075X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the United States alone was using 30% of the world’s resources and if everyone were to consume at that rate, we would need 3-5 planets to sustain this type of living. Resources are quickly becoming depleted, with about ⅓ already gone. With new consumer markets rising in the developing countries which account for a much higher percent of the world’s population, this number can only rise. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth===
The [[Worldwatch Institute]] said China and India, with their booming economies, along with the United States, are the three planetary forces that are shaping the global [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Renner|first=Michael|title=State of the world 2005: A Worldwatch Institute Report on progress toward a sustainable society.|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/3866|accessdate=2009-09-14|date=January 2006|publisher=[[W.W.

The report states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The world's ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of China, India, Japan, Europe and the United States as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Footprint==
{{main article|Ecological footprint}}
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=If everyone consumed resources at the US level, you will need another four or five Earths.|source=—[[Paul R. Ehrlich]], biologist&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/25/half-all-species-extinct-end-century-vatican-conference Biologists say half of all species could be extinct by end of century]. ''[[The Guardian]].'' February 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The idea of overconsumption is also strongly tied to the idea of an ecological footprint.  The term “ecological footprint” refers to the “resource accounting framework for measuring human demand on the biosphere.”  Currently, China is roughly 11 times lower in per capita footprint, yet has a population that is more than four times the size of the USA.  It is estimated that if China developed to the level of the United States that world consumption rates would roughly double.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Diamond" /&gt;  According to Scientific American, one person from China uses 53 times fewer resources than the average American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/american-consumption-habits/|title=American Consumption|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' postulates that meat consumption is set to increase as the result of [[human population growth]] and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Devlin|first=Hannah |date=July 19, 2018 |title=Rising global meat consumption 'will devastate environment'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/19/rising-global-meat-consumption-will-devastate-environment|work=The Guardian |location= |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counteractions==
The most obvious solution to the issue of overconsumption is to simply slow the rate at which materials are becoming [[Resource depletion|depleted]]. Less consumption naturally has negative effects on economies - so instead, countries must look to curb consumption rates while allowing for new industries, such as [[renewable energy]] and [[recycling]] technologies, to flourish and deflect some of the economic burden. A fundamental shift in the global economy may be necessary in order to account for the current change that is taking place or that will need to take place. Movements and lifestyle choices related to stopping overconsumption include: [[anti-consumerism]], [[freeganism]], [[green economics]], [[ecological economics]], [[degrowth]], [[frugality]], [[Downshifting (lifestyle)|downshifting]], [[simple living]], [[The Minimalists|minimalism]], and thrifting.

Recent grassroots movements have been coming up with creative ways to decrease the amount of goods we consume. [[The Freecycle Network]] is a network of people in one's community that are willing to trade goods for other goods or services. It is a new take on thrifting while still being beneficial to both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freecycle.org/|title=The Freecycle Network|website=www.freecycle.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other researchers and movements such as [[the Zeitgeist Movement]] suggest a new socioeconomic model which, through a structural increase of [[efficiency]], collaboration and locality in production as well as effective [[sharing economy|sharing]], increased [[modularity]], sustainability and optimal design of products, are expected to reduce resource-consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq The Zeitgeist Movement - Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815095626/http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq |date=2012-08-15 }} Retrieved on 6 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">[[File:Koitjärve raba 05-2015.jpg|thumb|Paludification is the process by which forest is converted to peatland.]]

'''Paludification''' is the most common process by which [[peatlands]] in the [[Taiga|boreal zone]] are formed. 

== Formation ==

The process is characterized by [[peat]] initialization on previously drier and vegetated habitats over inorganic soils, with no fully aquatic phase.&lt;ref&gt;Vitt, D.H., 2006. Functional characteristics and indicators of boreal peatlands. In: Wieder, R.K., Vitt, D.H. (Eds.), Boreal Peatland Ecosystems (Ecological Studies), Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Germany, 9-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the paludification process includes a shift from [[forest]]s, [[grassland]] or long exposed bare land to peatland.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhry, P., Turunen, J., 2006. The postglacial development of boreal and subarctic peatlands. In: Wieder, R.K., Vitt, D.H. (Eds.), Boreal Peatland Ecosystems (Ecological Studies), Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Germany, 25-46. &lt;/ref&gt; The initiation of this accumulation of organic matter (i.e. peat), can be controlled by both allogenic (i.e. external to the ecosystem) and autogenic (i.e. internal to the ecosystem) factors.&lt;ref&gt;Charman, D. 2002. Peatlands and Environmental Change. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK. 301p.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hydrology|hydrological]] balance is critical for the initiation of peat. The hydrological balance can simply be defined as the difference between the incoming and outgoing amount of water (e.g. precipitation minus [[evapotranspiration]] and minus runoff). Usually it is considered that factors such as climate, geomorphology, [[geology]] and soils control this balance. However, paludification may also be just a result of the local accumulation of peat (i.e. autogenic factor).&lt;ref&gt;Charman, D. 2002. Peatlands and Environmental Change. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK. 301p.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Climatic factors ==

The climate factor has a great influence on the paludification process. The development of a paludified soil requires a positive hydrological balance during the growing season. Therefore, there needs to be a shift in local hydrological conditions. Such a shift could be caused by an increase in water inputs or a decrease in outputs. Human activity such as tree removal, natural or human induced [[forest fire]]s, increase in [[precipitation]], and [[Podzol|podsolization]], etc. are processes which could change those in- and outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Lavoie, M., Paré, D., Fenton, N., Taylor, K., Groot, A., and Foster, N., 2005. Paludification and forest management in the Northern Clay Section: a literature review. Lake Abitibi Model Forest Technical Report No.1. 75 p. link: {{cite web |url=http://www.lamf.net/Products/reports/Lavoie%20Paludification%20For%20Publication%20final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106180254/http://www.lamf.net/Products/reports/Lavoie%20Paludification%20For%20Publication%20final.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Geomorphology ==

The factor geomorphology (and also topography) creates spatial diversity in the hydrological characteristics of the landscape. The flat topography (and thus low slopes) in the two major peatlands in the world, located in the [[West Siberian Plain]] and in the [[Hudson Bay Lowlands|Hudson/James Bay Lowlands]] of [[Canada]] respectively, illustrate the significance of this factor.&lt;ref&gt;Lavoie, M., Paré, D., Fenton, N., Taylor, K., Groot, A., and Foster, N., 2005. Paludification and forest management in the Northern Clay Section: a literature review. Lake Abitibi Model Forest Technical Report No.1. 75 p. link: {{cite web |url=http://www.lamf.net/Products/reports/Lavoie%20Paludification%20For%20Publication%20final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106180254/http://www.lamf.net/Products/reports/Lavoie%20Paludification%20For%20Publication%20final.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of soils ==

Geology and soils (i.e. bedrock and texture) play also an important role. When the mineral soil is composed of heavy clay, the soil will act as an impermeable substrate that facilitates water accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;Lavoie, M., Paré, D., Fenton, N., Taylor, K., Groot, A., and Foster, N., 2005. Paludification and forest management in the Northern Clay Section: a literature review. Lake Abitibi Model Forest Technical Report No.1. 75 p. link: {{cite web |url=http://www.lamf.net/Products/reports/Lavoie%20Paludification%20For%20Publication%20final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106180254/http://www.lamf.net/Products/reports/Lavoie%20Paludification%20For%20Publication%20final.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the context of forest management, paludification has been studied intensively during the last decade. Especially because of the negative effects paludification has for the boreal forests. In this way that paludification may lead to:

* Reduction in soil temperature, soil aeration, nutrient availability, decomposition rates
* Formation of [[permafrost]] in certain areas
* Increase of the [[water table]] level
* Decrease in tree productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Lavoie, M., Paré, D., Fenton, N., Taylor, K., Groot, A., and Foster, N., 2005.

[[File:Paperclayturtle.JPG|thumb|A paper clay turtle]]
'''Paper clay''' (sometimes referred to as '''fiberclay''') is any [[clay]] body to which processed [[cellulose]] fiber ([[paper]] being the most common) has been added.&lt;ref&gt;Paper clay should be distinguished from [http://paperclay.com/ Paperclay], aka Creative Paperclay, which is an air hardening, non-clay modelling material popular within the recreational arts, crafts, puppet and doll-maker communities. Paperclay is a registered trademark only within the U.S. (Patent and Trademark Office. Registration No. 1814872).&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Earthenware]], [[terra cotta]], [[stoneware]], [[porcelain]] and [[bone china]] clay bodies can be made into paper clay.  The more fiber added to the clay body, the stronger the unfired dry paper clay, but the weaker the fired body.  The less fiber added to the clay body, the weaker the unfired dry paper clay, but the stronger the fired body. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grahamhay.com.au/farrow1987.html|year=1987|accessdate=2012-08-26|title="Paper/Clay" by Carol Farrow|work=Artists Newsletter.}} Article hosted by grahamhay.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional soft clay building techniques can be used with soft paper clay.  This is because there is no physical difference between soft clay and the same clay as a soft paper clay, except the addition of a small percentage of tiny inert cellulose fibers.    However it is recommended to use less fiber in paper clay on the potters wheel, particularly if the leather hard work is to be trimmed on the wheel.  Paper clay can be made from left over throwing slip from wheel throwing. It is widely used by potters to repair cracks in dry, conventional clay, as well as dry paper clay.

Thinner and taller work can be built with partially dry or completely dry paper clay.  Re-wetting paper clay is faster with paper clay than pure clay, as the paper fibres pull water more quickly into the clay body.  The damp sections can be then joined. Accelerated drying of paper clay work is possible, and results in less warping and cracking, compared with drying conventional clay. The more fiber in the paper clay, the more rapid the drying with less warping and cracking, and the quicker dry-to-dry joins can be made.

The firing process for paper clay is similar to firing of conventional clay. The clay still needs to be completely dry before firing so the change of water into steam does not cause the clay to explode. Maximum [[Kiln#Ceramic kilns|firing]] temperatures, firing schedules and types of glaze to use for paper clay, are the same as that used for the specific clay used in the paper clay.  Some recommend slightly higher firing temperatures.  Because dry paper clay is more porous and has greater tensile strength than dry clay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grahamhay.com.au/juvonen1997.html|date=June 1997|accessdate=2007-12-14|title="Using paper fibre as a substitute in ceramic clays" by Leena Juvonen|work=8th CIMTEC World Ceramics Congress.}} Article hosted by grahamhay.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; single [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] firing is possible.  Due to its higher dry tensile strength there are less breakages during handing and kiln loading. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grahamhay.com.au/campbell1997.html|year=1997|accessdate=2012-08-26|title="Where There's Smoke... Paperclay in the Anagama - a new technology in an old setting." by Barbara Campbell-Allen|work=Pottery in Australia.}} Article hosted by grahamhay.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; 

Replacing some of the clay with fiber, will reduce the thermal mass of clay, in turn reducing further the energy required to fire the work.  Changing to paper clay from conventional clay offers considerable energy, financial and time savings when firing ceramics in educational institutions.

Nonconventional clay techniques are now possible after adding processed cellulose fiber to any clay:  First,  joining dry-to-dry paper clay and dry-to-soft paper clay are the most radical new techniques.  Secondly, metal supports and ceramic material may be used within paper clay, with less cracking than conventional clay &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmau.com/article.html|year=1997|accessdate=2012-08-26|title="Paper Clay and Steel by Linda Mau|work=Ceramics Monthly Magazine.}} Article hosted by lmau.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A new aesthetic has also emerged from combining paper and clay art traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grahamhay.com.au/hay2006update.html|year=2006|accessdate=2007-12-14|title="A Paperclay Update" by Graham Hay|work=Ceramics Technical.}} Article hosted by grahamhay.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, dry paper clay is stronger than the same clay without the fiber, so work can be made thinner, and more delicate. 

Using paper clay require less technical skill than conventional clay, so beginners can focus more on the creative expression of their ideas.  For example, handles of soft paper clay can be added to a completely dry paper clay pot without distorting the form.   Other forms built with coils no longer need to be correctly joined before drying, instead, after drying the form, paper clay slip may be applied to join the coils and fill any gaps.  Breaks and cracks in both dry and fired paper clay work can be repaired with paper clay slip. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paperclayart.com/191pdf/4Pclay%20Primer%206pp.pdf|year=1999|accessdate=2012-08-26|title="Paper clay A Primer" by Rosette Gault|work=Pottery Making Illustrated Handbook.}} Article hosted by paperclayart.com&lt;/ref&gt;

POM is readily decomposable, serving many [[soil functions]] and providing terrestrial material to water bodies. It is a source of food for both [[soil organisms]] and aquatic organisms, and provides [[Plant nutrition|nutrients]] for plants. POM also enhances [[soil structure]] leading to increased [[Infiltration (hydrology)|water infiltration]], aeration and resistance to [[erosion]] &lt;ref name="brady" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nrcs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Particulate Organic Matter|url=http://soilquality.org/indicators/pom.html|website=Soil quality for environmental health|publisher=NRCS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil management practices, such as [[tillage]] and [[compost]]/[[manure]] application, alter the POM content of soil and water.&lt;ref name="brady" /&gt;&lt;ref name="greg" /&gt;

== Role in the lower aquatic food web ==
Along with [[dissolved organic matter]], POM drives the lower aquatic food web by providing energy in the form of carbohydrates, sugars, and other polymers that can be degraded.  POM in water bodies is derived from terrestrial inputs (e.g. soil organic matter, leaf litterfall), submerged or floating aquatic vegetation, or autochthonous production of algae.  Each source of POM has its own chemical composition that affects its lability, or accessibility to the food web.

== Role in soil function == 
The [[decomposition]] of POM provides energy and nutrients. Nutrients not taken up by soil organisms may be available for plant uptake.&lt;ref name="greg" /&gt; The amount of nutrients released ([[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralized]]) during decomposition depends on the biological and chemical characteristics of the POM, such as the [[Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio|C:N ratio]].&lt;ref name="greg" /&gt; In addition to nutrient release, decomposers colonizing POM play a role in improving soil structure.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Six|first1=J.|last2=Bossuyt|first2=H.|last3=Degryze|first3=S|last4=Denef|first4=K|title=A history of research on the link between (micro) aggregates, soil biota, and soil organic matter dynamics|journal=Soil and Tillage Research|date=2004|volume=79|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1016/j.still.2004.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungal [[mycelium]] entangle soil particles and release sticky, cement-like, polysaccharides into the soil; ultimately forming soil aggregates &lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

== Effect of soil management == 
Soil POM content is affected by organic inputs and the activity of soil decomposers. The addition of organic materials, such as manure or [[crop residues]], typically results in an increase in POM.&lt;ref name="greg" /&gt; Alternatively, repeated tillage or soil disturbance increases the rate of decomposition by exposing soil organisms to oxygen and organic [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]]; ultimately, depleting POM. Reduction in POM content is observed when native grasslands are converted to agricultural land.&lt;ref name="brady" /&gt; Soil temperature and moisture also affect the rate of POM decomposition.&lt;ref name="greg" /&gt; Because POM is a readily available (labile) source of soil nutrients, is a contributor to soil structure, and is highly sensitive to soil management, it is frequently used as an indicator to measure [[soil quality]].&lt;ref name="nrcs" /&gt;

=== Surface water contamination === 
In poorly-managed soils, particularly on sloped ground, erosion and transport of soil [[sediment]] rich in POM can contaminate water bodies.&lt;ref name="nrcs" /&gt; Because POM provides a source of energy and nutrients, rapid build-up of organic matter in water can result in [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; Suspended organic materials can also serve as a potential vector for the pollution of water with [[Fecal coliform|fecal bacteria]], toxic metals or organic compounds.

The '''Peterson Identification System''' is a practical method for the field identification of [[Animal identification|animals]], plants and other natural phenomena. It was devised by [[ornithologist]] [[Roger Tory Peterson]] in 1934 for the first of his series of ''Field Guide''s&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Roger Tory (1934), ''A Field Guide to the Birds'', [[Boston]]: [[Houghton Mifflin Company]].&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Peterson Field Guides]].) Peterson devised his system "so that live birds could be identified readily at a distance by their 'field marks' without resorting to the bird-in-hand characters that the early collectors relied on. During the last half century the binocular and the spotting scope have replaced the shotgun."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Roger Tory (1980), ''A Field Guide to the Birds: A Completely New Guide to All the Birds of Eastern and Central North America'', Fourth Edition, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it both reflected and contributed to awareness of the emerging early [[environmental movement]].

==The system==
Created for use by [[amateur]] naturalists and [[laymen]], rather than specialists, the "Peterson System" is essentially a pictorial key based upon readily noticed visual impressions rather than on the technical features of interest to scientists. The technique involves patternistic drawings with arrows that pinpoint the key field comparisons between similar species.

==Influence==
Since the first Peterson ''Field Guide'', the system has been expanded to about three dozen volumes in the series as well as being emulated by many other publishers and authors of [[field guide]]s. It has become the near-universally accepted standard, first in the United States and Europe and then around the world.

'''Ropar Wetland''', also named '''Ropar Lake''', is a man-made freshwater riverine and [[Lake|lacustrine]] [[wetland]]. The area has at least 9 [[mammal]], 154 [[bird]] (migratory and local), 35 [[fish]], 9 [[arthropod]], 11 [[rotifer]], 9 [[crustacean]] and 10 [[protozoan]] species, making it [[Biodiversity|biologically diverse]].&lt;ref name = invent&gt;"[http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/csurv/Wetland%20Inventory.pdf Inventory of Wetlands]." Ropar Reservoir, pp. 380-403. Retrieved on 12 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
This important ecological zone is located in the [[Siwalik Hills|Shivalik]] foothills of the Lower [[Himalayas]] and was created in 1952 on the [[Sutlej River]], in the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] state of [[India]], by building a head regulator to store and divert water for beneficial uses of irrigation, drinking and industrial water supply. The endangered [[turtle]] ''[[Chitra indica]]'' and the threatened snake ''[[Python molurus]]'' ("at lower risk"), as per [[IUCN Red List]], are reported to be resident in the wetland.&lt;ref name = ropa&gt;"[http://www.wwfindia.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/freshwater_wetlands/our_work/ramsar_sites/ropar_lake_.cfm Ropar Lake]."

Retrieved on 12 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the wetland’s diverse and rich biodiversity, [[Ramsar Convention]] has included Ropar Wetland (listed as Ropar Lake) as one of the [[List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance|Ramsar sites]] among the 26 sites listed under India, for "the conservation of global biological diversity and for sustaining human life through the ecological and hydrological functions they perform."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ramsar.org/sitelist.doc The List of Wetlands of International Importance]" (DOC). The Secretariat of the Convention on Wetlands. 31 October 2008. Retrieved on 12 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wetland is a popular tourist attraction for bird watching and boating.  A tourism complex called the ‘Pinccasia’ is located within the wetland boundary, which is run by the Punjab Tourism Development Corporation. A boat club is also functioning.&lt;ref name = sheet/&gt;

== Access ==
{{Further|Rupnagar|Ropar}}
The wetland is located close to the [[Ropar|Rupnagar]] city, 45&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Chandigarh]] City, in [[Roopnagar]] and [[Nawanshahr]] districts of Punjab. Chandigarh is the nearest airport, which connects to the rest of India.

== History ==
{{Further|Rupnagar|Ropar}}
An archaeological museum of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] at [[Ropar]] has displays of the antiquities unearthed during the excavations of mound in the area along with photographs displaying excavation material. The Museum depicts a sequence of six cultural periods or phases, with some breaks from [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] times to the present day,  found in the 21 metre high ancient mound known as Nalagarh Tibbi overlaying the [[Shiwalik]] (also spelt Sivalik) deposition on the left bank of the Satluj River where it emerges into the plains. A deep well with a stone inscription of Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] (AD 1627-1658) has been located at the foot of the mound. The excavations have established that advanced civilization similar to the [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjodaro]] Civilization prospered in Ropar town, an integral part of the wetland.&lt;ref name = gazet&gt;"[http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/gazropr23.htm Places of Interest, Rupnagar]." ''Gazetter Rupnagar'', Chapter 19. [http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/ Punjab Department of Revenue].  1987.  Retrieved on 12 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Anglo - Sikh treaty===
The wetland area has also a modern history in respect of Anglo - Sikh relations. On 26 October 1831, sitting under the shade of an old [[ficus]] tree on the bank of [[Sutlej River]], [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] and [[Lord William Bentinck]], the British Governor General signed an agreement defining the Anglo - Sikh relations and territories.&lt;ref name = ropa/&gt;&lt;ref name = gazet/&gt;

==Topography==
The total area covered by the Wetland is 1365 ha, which includes 800 ha area of the river and the reservoir, 30 ha of forest area named as Sadavarat Forest and 30 ha under marshy plants. The wetland is surrounded by hills in the North West and by plain area in the South and South East. Agricultural crops such as [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[sorghum]] etc., are grown in the farm lands in the area surrounding the wetland but the hills have thin vegetation and are exposed to intensive grazing.&lt;ref name = sheet/&gt;

== Hydrology ==
Climatically, the drainage area of the wetland falls under semi-arid zone of Punjab with mean annual rainfall of 1518&amp;nbsp;mm. Initially, in the year 1882, a small headwork was constructed on the right bank of [[Sutlej River]], near [[Ropar]] town, to supply water to Sirhind Canal. Subsequently in 1952 a head regulator was constructed to divert water not only to the Bist Doab Canal but also to Sirhind Canal and to the Bhakra Main Canal (upstream of the wetland), for [[irrigation]], industrial and domestic use.&lt;ref name = invent/&gt;

==Water quality==
Water quality that determines the health of ecosystem of the wetland was monitored by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) in the year 1998-99. The water quality was reported to be of 'A' category as the river entered into Punjab and deteriorated to 'D' category downstream of Ropar Lake, mainly due to the industrial effluents from a number of factories and industrial units. Further studies on physico-chemical analysis of important parameters, biological estimations as well as [[pesticide]] residue analysis have been initiated.&lt;ref name = invent/&gt;&lt;ref name = sheet/&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
The wetland is rich in [[flora]] and [[fauna]] which are categorized below.&lt;ref name = invent/&gt;&lt;ref name = sheet/&gt;

=== Flora ===
A total of 19 species of trees and 14 species of bushes and grasses are recorded. Of these, the tree species are ''[[Acacia catechu]]'', ''[[Ameles modesta]]'', ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'', ''[[Albizzia]] lebbek'' ''[[Azadirachta indica]]'', ''[[Bombax ceiba]]'', ''[[Cassia fistula]]'', ''[[Dalbergia sissoo]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus tereticornis]]'', ''[[Ficus benghalensis]]'', ''[[Ficus religiosa]]'', ''[[Mangifera indica]]'', ''[[Melia azedarach]]'', ''[[Moringa oleifera]]'', ''[[Morus indica]]'', ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', ''[[Salix]]'' (willow), ''[[Syzygium cumini]]'' (jambul) and ''[[Zizyphus jujuba]]''.&lt;ref name = invent/&gt;

=== Aquafauna ===
Wetland is a major source of fisheries since large species of fishes have been recorded; some of the commercially important ones are: [[Labeo rohita|Rohu]]; [[Labeo gonius]] Seerha; [[Labeo]] calbasu Kalbans or Dhai; [[Labeo]] dero Gid; [[Labeo]] dyocheilus (Kunni); [[Catla]] catla Thal; Cirrhinus mrigala Mori; [[Puntius]] sarana Puthi; Cyprinus carpio communis ([[common carp]]); Cyprinus carpio spacularis ([[Mirror carp]]); Ceenopharyngodon idelle ([[grass carp]]); [[wallago attu]] Mali; Aorichthys seenghala Sangarha; [[Mastacembelus armatus]] Sam (Tire track eel); Ambasis ranga Shisha Mach; [[Channa]] punctatus Dolla (snake headed fish); and [[Channa striata]] Curd.

Gour species of [[frogs]] have been noted.

=== Avifauna ===
Several species of birds have been recorded including  49 local birds, 11 migratory birds, 3 rare birds and 54 common birds. Some of the rare  migratory birds are: [[golden-backed woodpecker]] (''Dinopium benghalense'', [[crimson-breasted barbet]] (''Megalaima haemacephala'') and [[green barbet]] (''Stactolaema olivacea'').

===Fauna===
Two species of tortoise (''[[Geoclemys hamiltonii]]'' and ''[[Chitra indica]]'' both endangered), five species of lizards, eleven species of snakes including the threatened ''[[Python molurus]]'' or Indian python or ajgar are found in the wetland.

==Food chain==
The [[food chain]] in the wetland is basically well balanced as it has both deep water and shallow water characteristics and the ecosystem is stated to be &lt;blockquote&gt;
''almost self sufficient and self-regulating.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; A Scientific study of the food chain has brought out the following sequence of facts.&lt;ref name = sheet/&gt;
* [[Sunlight]], [[pH]], inorganic salts, [[nutrients]] and dissolved gases are the main [[abiotic]] components of the wetland ecosystems with the organic matter caused by the death and decay of animals and plants accumulating at the bottom of the lake
* [[Decomposition]] at the bottom of the lake takes place due to a variety of [[heterotrophic]] [[microbes]] such as [[bacteria]], [[actinomycetes]] and [[fungi]]; [[Aspergillus]] sp., [[Rhizopus]] sp., [[Curvularia]] sp., [[Paecilomyces]] sp., [[Saprolegnia]] sp. etc. are main species causing the decomposition
* The producers of [[organic matter]] are the [[eutrophic]] green [[plants]] and some [[photosynthetic]] [[bacteria]]; the rooted submerged, floating and emergent [[hydrophytes]] being the [[Typha]] sp., [[Eleocharis]] sp., [[Sagittaria]] sp., [[Nymphaea]] sp., [[Potamogeton]] sp., [[Vallisneria]] sp., [[Eichhornia]] sp., [[Lemna]] sp. etc. and minute, floating or suspended lower plants like [[filamentous algae]], [[diatoms]], [[chlorococcales]] and [[flagellates]].
* [[Herbivores]] such as the [[mollusks]], [[crustaceans]], [[rotifers]] and some [[insects]] are the primary consumers which feed directly on plants.
* Plant remains and organic matter nourish [[detritivore]]s like the [[Chironomidae]] sp., [[mollusks]], [[mites]], some [[crustaceans]] and small [[fishes]]
* Marginal rooted [[macrophytes]] are consumed by [[mammals]] such as [[water buffalo|buffaloes]], [[cows]] etc. which frequent the shores of the lake
* [[Hydrophytes]] are also the food source of some [[birds]]
*[[Carnivores]] like the Predator [[beetles]] and bugs, [[dragonflies]] are the secondary consumers which feed on [[insects]], [[mollusks]], [[rotifers]] and [[crustaceans]]. [[Carnivorous]] fishes also belong to this category
* Large [[carnivorous]] fishes and [[birds]] are the [[tertiary]] consumers which feed on small fishes and insects.
* Top most consumer level is that of the human being and the fish eating birds, which feed mainly on fishes

== Adverse impacts on the wetland ==
Over the years several adverse impacts on the quality of the wetland have been reported. Some of the important ones which invited remedial actions are:&lt;ref name = invent/&gt;&lt;ref name = sheet/&gt;
* Acute problems of siltation from the adjoining barren and fragile hills. Bare hills of the catchment are subject to continuous erosion leading to shrinkage of wetland area.
* Unwarranted interference with the resident and migratory birds
* Unauthorized fishing and poaching of wildlife causing damage to species
* Increase in effluents from industrializatation in the upstream area of the wetland, such as the Fertilizer plant at Nangal and Thermal Power Plant at Ropar
* Effluents of chemical pollutants like agrochemical residues run off, industrial effluents and sewage from some towns in the upper reaches of the wetland
* Growth of Invasive weeds

== Restoration measures ==
The Punjab State Council for Science &amp; Technology has evolved several conservation programmes with support from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoE&amp;F) of the Govt of India. Some of the programmes implemented include mass awareness campaigns and promotion of public participation in the wetland conservation. A few of the measures planned and under various stages of implementation are:&lt;ref name = invent/&gt;&lt;ref name = sheet/&gt;
* Afforestation and soil conservation in the highly erosion prone catchment areas of   the wetland,
* To erect chain-link fencing of strategic areas of the wetland to prevent exploitation of vital wetland resources and prevent encroachments of the wetland
* detailed survey, including remote sensing survey and preparation of  comprehensive maps
* Detailed [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] studies of plant and animal species
* Introduce fish species sustain fragile relationship between the fish level and the other biotic resources like birds and primary producers and to set up new fish seed farms in addition to refurbish the existing ponds.
* Economic assessment

'''Sarasvati Pushkaram''' is a festival of [[Sarasvati River|River Sarasvati]] normally occurs once in 12 years. Saraswati River is considered as the 'Antarvahini' (invisible river) which flows at Triveni Sangam. This [[Pushkaram]] is observed for a period  of 12 days from the time of entry of [[Jupiter]] into ''Mithuna'' rasi ([[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roshen Dalal |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT921 |date=18 April 2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-81-8475-277-9 |pages=921–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Birds of the Western Palearctic''''' (full title '''''Handbook of the Birds of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa: The Birds of the Western Palearctic'''''; often referred to by the initials '''''BWP''''') is a nine-volume [[ornithological handbook]] covering the birds of the western portion of the [[Palearctic zoogeographical region|Palearctic]] [[zoogeographical region]].

==Book==

''The Birds of the Western Palearctic'' is a comprehensive regional avifauna for the [[Western Palearctic]]. It consists of 9 volumes, the first published in 1977 and the ninth in 1994. The main editor for the first five volumes was [[Stanley Cramp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1=Simmons | first1=K.E.L. | year=1992 | title=A life for ornithology: Stanley Cramp (1913-1987) | journal=British Birds | volume=85 | issue=Special Supplement | pages=387–414 [407-412] | url=https://britishbirds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/article_files/V85/V85_N07/V85_N07_P387_414_OB115.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cramp died in 1987 and the subsequent volumes were edited by Duncan Brooks and [[Chris Perrins|Christopher Perrins]]. ''BWP'''s format and breadth influenced the development of regional avifaunas for other parts of the world, notably ''[[The Birds of Africa]]''.

A two-volume ''Concise Edition'' was produced in 1998. Both the full and concise editions were published by [[Oxford University Press]] (OUP).

The boundary used for the region included [[Iceland]], but not [[Greenland]]; all of [[Macaronesia]] (islands off Portugal and North Africa); North Africa; the northern parts of the [[Arabian peninsula]]; [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]], but not [[Iran]]; and Russia west of the [[Ural Mountains|Ural]]s.  A number of subsequent papers have questioned the appropriateness of this boundary, particularly its southern and southeastern delimitations, among them Martins &amp; Hirschfeld (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Martins, R. P. &amp; Hirschfeld, E. (1994) Where are the limits of the Western Palearctic? ''[[Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club]]'' 114: 207-08&lt;/ref&gt; Martins and Hirschfeld published a more detailed paper in 1998, discussing the boundary in [[Iran]] and the [[Arabian peninsula]]. They concluded that the mountainous western and northern areas of Iran, and the Arabian peninsula, except for two small enclaves in the south, should be included in the Western Palearctic.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, R. P. &amp; Hirschfeld, Erik (1998) Comments on the limits of the Western Palearctic in Iran and the Arabian Peninsula ''[[Sandgrouse]]'' 20(2): 108-34&lt;/ref&gt; Ullman (2000) disagreed with their conclusions regarding the Arabian enclaves, however, arguing that their [[wikt:depauperate|depauperate]] avifauna, when compared to species-rich areas in northeast Africa, justified inclusion of the whole of Arabia in the Western Palearctic.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, Magnus (2000) The limits of the Western Palearctic ''[[Sandgrouse]]'' 22(1): 74-75&lt;/ref&gt; Roselaar (2006), analysing the breeding distributions of 1037 [[passerine]] bird species in the [[Palearctic zoogeographical region|Palearctic]] region, and northern parts of the Afrotropical and Oriental regions, also proposed a southern boundary somewhat to the south of that used by ''BWP''. He excluded southernmost parts of Arabia, albeit with a slightly different border to that used by Martins &amp; Hirschfeld.&lt;ref&gt;Roselaar, Kees (2006) The boundaries of the Palearctic region ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]'' 99(12): 602-18&lt;/ref&gt;

A journal, ''BWP Update'', was published for a number of years following the completion of ''BWP''.

Two electronic versions of ''BWP'' have been produced. The first, produced by OUP, suffered from a number of technical problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.co.uk/ep/cdroms/compbwp/ |title=The Complete Birds of the Western Palearctic |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2009-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121144037/http://www.oup.co.uk/ep/cdroms/compbwp/ |archivedate=November 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and customers were offered a refund.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The second, known as "BWP''i''", was produced by [[BirdGuides Ltd.]] This included the full text of the nine volumes, the ''Concise Edition'', all updates from ''BWP Update'', new video and audio, and recent taxonomical changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdguides.com/bwpi/ |archivedate=2 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102214155/http://www.birdguides.com/bwpi/ |title=Presenting BWPi 2.0 |publisher=BirdGuides Ltd |date= |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Colours of Animals''''' is a [[zoology]] book written in 1890 by Sir [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] (1856–1943). It was the first substantial textbook to argue the case for [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]ian selection applying to all aspects of [[animal coloration]]. The book also pioneered the concept of [[frequency-dependent selection]] and introduced the term "[[aposematism]]".

The book begins with a brief account of the physical causes of animal coloration. The second chapter gives an overview of the book, describing the various uses of colour in terms of the advantages it can bring through [[natural selection]]. The next seven chapters describe camouflage, both in predators and in prey. [[List of camouflage methods|Methods of camouflage]] covered include background matching, resemblance to specific objects such as bird droppings, self-decoration with materials from the environment, and the seasonal colour change of arctic animals. Two chapters cover warning colours, including both [[Batesian mimicry]], where the mimic is edible, and [[Mullerian mimicry]], where distasteful species mimic each other. A chapter then looks at how animals combine multiple methods of defence, for instance in the [[Cerura vinula|puss moth]]. Two chapters examine coloration related to sexual selection. Finally Poulton summarizes the subject with a fold-out table including a set of Greek derived words that he invented, of which "aposematic" and "cryptic" survive in biological usage.

''The Colours of Animals'' was well received on its publication, although the book's support for [[sexual selection]] was criticised by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], and its Darwinism and critique of [[Lamarckism]] were attacked by [[Edward Drinker Cope]].  Wallace liked Poulton's experimental work but was critical of his opinions on [[sexual selection]]. The [[Lamarckism|Neo-Lamarckian]] Cope criticised Poulton's support for Darwin but liked the book's many observations of animal coloration. Modern biologists respect Poulton's advocacy of natural selection and sexual selection, despite the lack at the time of an adequate theory of [[heredity]], and his recognition of frequency-dependent selection.

; Evidence for natural selection

Poulton explains in his Preface that

{{quote|My chief object has been to demonstrate the utility of colour and marking in animals. In many cases I have attempted to prove that [[Natural Selection]] has sufficed to account for the results achieved; and I fully believe that further knowledge will prove that this principle explains the origin of all appearances except those which are due to the subordinate principle of [[Sexual Selection]]...|E.B. Poulton&lt;ref group=P&gt;Poulton, 1890. p viii.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

; Evidence for sexual selection
[[File:ArgusDisplayLyd4.png|thumb|right|Male argus pheasant (''[[Argusianus argus]]'') displaying to a female&lt;!--Drawn by "W A C"--&gt;, from [[Richard Lydekker]]'s ''Royal Natural History'', 1895.&lt;ref&gt;This image shows the argus pheasant described in the text; the bird is not illustrated in the book.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Poulton strongly supports Darwin both on the general theme of natural selection, and on the power of sexual selection in species which are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] (where, usually, the male is showier than the female):

{{quote|When we look at the marvellous eyes upon the train of a [[Peacock]], or the more beautiful markings on the feathers of the  male [[argus pheasant|Argus Pheasant]], it seems impossible that so wonderful and complete a result can have been produced by the [[aesthetic]] [[sexual selection|preferences of female birds]]. And yet Mr. Darwin shows the relation between these characters and much simpler markings on other parts of the surface. He proves that the one has been derived from the other by gradual modification... Such facts, while eminently suggestive of ... some selective agency, seem to be unexplained by any other theory.|E.B. Poulton&lt;ref group=P&gt;Poulton, 1890. pp 334–335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCL&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/poulton90.html | title=E.B. Poulton (1890) | publisher=University College London | work=Extracts from 'The Colours of Animals' | accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Poulton knew his view was controversial, but believed he was winning the argument:&lt;ref name=Poulton286  group=P&gt;Poulton, 1890. p 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[A. R. Wallace|Mr. Wallace]]'s chief objection is the lack of evidence that the female has any aesthetic preferences at all in the selection of her mate. When, however, he admits that display of their decorative plumage by male birds is 'demonstrated', and that the females are in all probability 'pleased or excited by the display', he certainly admits the possession of an aesthetic sense...|E.B. Poulton&lt;ref group=P name=Poulton286/&gt;}}

; Frequency-dependent selection
In ''The Colours of Animals'', Poulton introduced the concept of [[frequency-dependent selection]] (selection based on how abundant a form is) in the context of a [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] which he argued would otherwise soon vanish:&lt;ref name=UCL/&gt;&lt;ref group=P&gt;Poulton, 1890. pp 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If we breed from moths developed from the green larvae of, e.g., the [[large emerald|Large Emerald]], the larvae in the next generation are chiefly green, and after several generations there is little doubt that the brown form would become excessively rare; so also the green form would disappear if we bred from the brown varieties. But in nature both forms are common, and therefore it is certain that both must be advantageous to the species, or one of them would quickly disappear. I believe that it is a benefit to the species that some of its larvae should resemble brown and others green catkins, instead of all of them resembling either brown or green. In the former case the foes have a wider range of objects for which they may mistake the larvae, and the search must occupy more time, for equivalent results, than in the case of other species which are not dimorphic.|E.B. Poulton&lt;ref name=UCL/&gt;}}

; Mimicry and aposematism
[[File:Brazilian Skunk from Edward Bagnall Poulton Colours of Animals 1890.jpg|thumb|left|Warning coloration of the "Brazilian Skunk" in ''The Colours of Animals''&lt;ref group=P&gt;Poulton, 1890. p 162.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The basic concept of warning coloration ([[aposematism]], like the black and yellow pattern of a wasp) is approached very simply:

{{quote|When an animal possesses an unpleasant attribute, it is often to its advantage to advertise the fact as publicly as possible. In this way it escapes a great deal of experimental 'tasting.' The conspicuous patterns and strongly contrasted colours which serve as the signal of danger or inedibility are known as Warning Colours.|E.B. Poulton&lt;ref  group=P name=Poulton21&gt;Poulton, 1890. p21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the next paragraph Poulton ties aposematism to mimicry as follows:

{{quote|It is these Warning Colours which are nearly always the objects of Protective Mimicry, and it will therefore be convenient to describe the former before the latter.|E.B. Poulton&lt;ref Group=P name=Poulton21/&gt;}}

Poulton introduced the term ''aposematism''&lt;ref name=Mallet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apheloria.org/Paul_Marek/Aposematism.html | title=Aposematism | publisher=Apheloria | accessdate=November 24, 2012 | author=Marek, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the words:

{{quote|The second head (Sematic Colours) includes Warning Colours and Recognition Markings: the former warn an enemy off, and are therefore called Aposematic;|E.B. Poulton&lt;ref  group=P name=Poulton337&gt;Poulton, 1890. pp 337–338.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{clear}}

The book's structure emphasises the extent to which Poulton, like Darwin, relied on a mass of evidence, mainly from insects, to make his case:&lt;ref name=Yost&gt;{{cite web | url=http://faculty.kirkwood.edu/ryost/poulton.htm | title=Edward Bagnall Poulton (1856–1943): Natural Selection and Butterfly Mimicry | publisher=Kirkwood Community College, Indiana | year=1995 | accessdate=November 20, 2012 | author=Yost, Robinson M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 1 '''The Physical Cause of Animal Colours'''.

: Poulton introduces absorption, scattering, colour due to "thin plates" ([[structural coloration]]), diffraction and refraction.

Chapter 2 '''The Uses of Colour'''.

: The effects of natural selection in creating or destroying colour are discussed. Colour can be non-significant, e.g. directly useful for absorbing heat, Poulton argues, but "By far the most widespread use of colour is to assist an animal in escaping from its enemies or in capturing its prey; the former is ''Protective'', the latter ''Aggressive'' [resemblance, i.e. camouflage]."&lt;ref group=P&gt;Poulton, 1890. p 19&lt;/ref&gt; The topics of mimicry, warning coloration, and sexual selection are introduced.

Chapter 3 '''Protective Resemblances in Lepidoptera'''.

: Poulton distinguishes "special" from "general" resemblances, meaning mimicking a specific object "of no interest to its enemies", or just harmonising "with the general artistic effect of its surroundings", giving examples from moth caterpillars found in England such as the [[peppered moth]] and the [[brimstone moth]].

Chapter 4 '''Protective Resemblances in Lepidoptera (continued), Dimorphism, Etc'''.

: The [[privet hawkmoth]] caterpillar is used as an example of "general resemblance". Dimorphism, where caterpillars of a species are sometimes green, sometimes brown, is discussed. The delicacy of larvae is given as a reason for their "wonderful concealment": one touch from a predator "being practically fatal". The resemblance of ''[[Kallima]]'' and some moths to dead leaves is examined.

Chapter 5 '''Protective Resemblances In Vertebrata, Etc'''.

: The camouflage of snakes, female birds that "undertake the duty of incubation", birds' eggs, mammals, fish, and marine molluscs is briefly covered.

Chapter 6 '''Aggressive Resemblances — Adventitious Protection'''.

: The camouflage of predators including lizards, [[angler fish]], [[mantises]] including ''[[Hymenopus bicornis]]'' and the bird-dropping spider is described. "Adventitious protection", making use of materials from the environment, is illustrated with examples such as the [[decorator crabs]] and [[caddis fly]] larvae, which build tubes "of grains of sand, small shells (often alive), vegetable fragments".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Poulton, 1890. p 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 7 '''Variable Protective Resemblance in Vertebrata, Etc'''.

: The ability of animals including fish, lizards and frogs to change their colours quickly is discussed. The changing of the pelage of arctic animals is attributed to the indirect effect of the change in temperature, i.e. a physiological response not a simple physical effect.

Chapter 8 '''Variable Protective Resemblance In Insects'''.

: Poulton describes in detail experiments demonstrating that moth pupae take on the colour of the background experienced earlier by the larvae.

Chapter 9 '''Protective Resemblances in Lepidoptera (continued)'''.

: Poulton discusses the metallic appearance of insect pupae, which he says is the reason for the name "chrysalis".{{efn|From the Greek for 'gold'.}} He rejects the (Lamarckian) view of the "origin of colour, by the direct influence of environment accumulated through many generations", which he agrees is "a very tempting conclusion", because of "clear evidence that the medium of the nervous system was necessary.&lt;ref group=P&gt;Poulton, 1890. p 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 10 '''Warning Colours'''.

: The conspicuous warning colours of many insects, skunks, snakes and salamanders are discussed. "It must have been obvious to any one interested in [[natural history]] that the insects met with during a walk in summer may be arranged in two great groups: ... difficult to find ... and ... startling colours and conspicuous attitudes"&lt;ref group=P&gt;Poulton, 1890. p 159&lt;/ref&gt; The association of warning with "nauseous or dangerous" animals is identified. The idea that warning coloured animals must be scarce relative to palatable ones is mentioned, along with the reason why different animals use the same warning colours.

Chapter 11 '''Warning Colours (continued)'''.

: Poulton discusses the relationship of colours used for sexual selection and for warning, and continues the discussion of warning with many examples, including [[Mullerian mimicry]], noting that this can both make a pair of distasteful species converge in appearance, and make a group of such species all resemble each other.

[[File:The Colours of Animals Classified According to Their Uses from Poulton 1890.jpg|thumb|Chapter 17's summary table: "The Colours of Animals Classified According to Their Uses"]]

Chapter 12 '''Protective Mimicry'''.

: The chapter looks at [[Batesian mimicry]] (where the mimic is edible) in both tropical butterflies and English moths, beginning "We now approach one of the most interesting aspects of our subject".

Chapter 13 '''Protective and Aggressive Mimicry'''.

: Poulton gives examples of mimicry in other insect groups, remarking the "very imperfect" resemblance of [[Hemaris|bee hawk-moth]]s to bees, which totally failed to "impose on" a lizard, but noting that the much more convincing mimicry of the [[hornet clearwing]] moth was treated with extreme caution by an inexperienced lizard.

Chapter 14 '''The Combination of Many Methods of Defence'''.

: The chapter describes animals including the [[Cerura vinula|puss moth]] caterpillar which combines a [[Deimatic behaviour|threatening display]] with camouflage and the [[chemical defense|ability to eject an irritant fluid]] for protection. Poulton also discusses the [[lobster moth]] caterpillar.

Chapter 15 '''Colours Produced by Courtship'''.

: Poulton discusses sexual selection in birds, butterflies and moths, and spiders, which he treats as another process alongside but supordinate to natural selection, with arguments against the views of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]. He notes that it was remarkable that biological research since Darwin had focussed mainly on comparative anatomy and embryology, whereas Darwin himself was interested in "questions which concern the living animal as a whole", and observes that there are "comparatively few true naturalists", as opposed to "anatomists, microscopists, systematists, or collectors".&lt;ref group=P&gt;Poulton, 1890. pp 286–287&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 16 '''Other Theories of Sexual Colouring'''.

: In this chapter, Poulton looks at "the causes which Mr. Wallace and other writers believe to have been efficient in producing sexual colouring", such as the principle of "recognition marking". Poulton uses the example of the [[satin bowerbird]] as evidence for an aesthetic sense.

Chapter 17 '''Summary And Classification'''.

:Poulton sums up his views with a fold-out table of "The Colours of Animals Classified According to Their Uses". The Greek derived category names include the now widely used [[aposematic]] and [[crypsis|cryptic]], alongside such epithets as "apatetic", "procryptic", "anticryptic", "episematic" and "epigamic", with variants.

==Reception==

===On first publication in 1890===

====Wallace in ''Nature''====
[[File:Masked Bowerbird.jpg|thumb|An [[aesthetic]] sense? Two males displaying to a female masked bowerbird, ''[[Sericulus aureus]]'', illustrated by [[John Gould]] (1804–1881)]]

The co-discoverer of natural selection [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], reviewing Poulton in ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'', was interested by Poulton's observations on [[structural coloration|thin films producing iridescence]]: "In some cases dried insects lose some of their metallic colours, but these reappear when the specimen is dipped in water."&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt; However, Wallace objected to Poulton's suggestion that arctic birds and mammals are white to reduce heat loss by radiation, for which he argued there was no evidence in favour, while a thicker "covering, such as actually occurs in all arctic animals" would reduce heat loss effectively, and could be observed to do so.&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S424.htm | title=The Colours of Animals | author=Wallace, Alfred Russel | journal=Nature |date=24 July 1890 | volume=42 | issue=1082 | pages=289–291 | doi = 10.1038/042289a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace was enthusiastic about Poulton's experimental work on how butterfly larvae vary their coloration according to the background, admiring "a number of ingenious experiments" in which Poulton illuminated the insects in light of one colour or another, causing reliable colour changes which could not be direct, like photography, but had to be mediated by the animal's nervous system:&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In some cases even the cocoons spun by the larvæ are modified by the surrounding colours; and still more curious changes are effected in the larva itself when ... the same species feeds on several plants having differently-coloured leaves. Even the presence of numerous dark twigs has been shown to cause a corresponding change of colour in the larva of the peppered moth (''[[Biston betularia|Amphidasis betularia]]'')."&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wallace's main criticism, occupying half his lengthy review, was of Poulton's acceptance of [[sexual selection]]. He begins by stating "Mr. Poulton fully accepts Darwin's theory of female choice as the source of the greater part of the brilliant colour, delicate patterns, and ornamental appendages that exist among animals, and especially among birds and insects." Wallace then cites Poulton on the courtship behaviour of spiders:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"'The female always watches the antics of the male intently, but often refuses him in the end, 'even after dancing before her for a long time.' Such observations strongly point towards the existence of female preference based on æsthetic considerations'"&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

at once objecting "To the last four words we demur, as being altogether unproved. Why æsthetic considerations?" Wallace then spends a whole page attacking Poulton on "the possession of an 'æsthetic sense' by those creatures in which sexual ornament occurs". Wallace objects that Poulton asserts the reality of sexual selection with no proof other than mentioning that insects can perceive colour, and that "a few birds collect bright objects, as in the case of the [[Bower bird|bower-birds]]".&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

Wallace gives a detailed counter-example to refute Poulton's argument, arguing that "really beautiful combinations of colour and marking" are found on the sea shells of molluscs "where sexual selection has certainly not come into play". To make the point, Wallace lists&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"the cones, cowries, olives, harps, volutes, pectens, and innumerable other molluscan shells; while many of the sea-anemones, and considerable numbers of the caterpillars with warning colours, are equally beautiful."&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And that was not all. Wallace continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Still more doubtful and more opposed to reasonable probability is the statement that 'our standards of beauty are largely derived from the contemplation of the numerous examples around us, which... have been created by the æsthetic preferences of the insect world'--alluding... to the colours and structures of flowers as being due to the need of attracting insects to fertilize them."&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was, Wallace insisted, "not a particle of evidence" of aesthetic preferences in "an insect's very limited mentality". The mention of the term aesthetic was "not scientific".&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

After so many "preceding remarks" against "the theory of sexual selection", Wallace concludes that "The book is well illustrated by numerous excellent woodcuts and a coloured plate", congratulates Poulton on "having produced so readable and suggestive a volume", and on having "contributed so largely" by "his own researches" into animal coloration.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

====''New York Times''====
An anonymous reviewer in the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that "Mr Poulton wishes first of all to put himself right with regard to his attitude to [[Darwinism]]",&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; mentioning that in 1888 he had been cited in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' as attacking Darwinism. The reviewer hastens to agree that Poulton is in fact "ready to combat Wallace, his master, on points wherein that great fellow-laborer with Charles Darwin dissents from the latter's views."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

As an example of this, the reviewer mentions Poulton's argument that Wallace must be wrong that "the coloring whereby the sexes often differ one from the other in a startling way is occasioned by a surplus vitality" because "sexual colors are only developed in species which court by day or twilight" and then only on parts of the body which the female "would oftenest and best see them".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/08/24/103261428.pdf | title=New York Times | work=Why Butterflies are Gay: The Colours of Animals. By Edward Bagnall Poulton | year=1890 | accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times reviewer argued that the title should have been less general "for readers are sure to demand too much from so comprehensive a term", given that Poulton refers mainly to insects rather than "wild beasts", but in the end he agreed "that Mr. Poulton has written a very suggestive treatise, well fitted for the general reader".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

====E.D. Cope in ''American Naturalist''====
[[File:Kallima inachus qtl1.jpg|thumb|"Most perfect concealment": ''[[Kallima inachus]]'', the "dead leaf" butterfly]]

The [[Lamarckism|Neo-Lamarckian]]&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt; [[Edward Drinker Cope]], reviewing the book for the ''[[American Naturalist]]'', writes that "Mr. Poulton supports his own theory of the direct physiological value of the uses of colour to animals by a large amount of experimental evidence brought together from many sources". Cope is attracted by "a detail of great interest" in a caterpillar's camouflage "by the semblance of a small hole to indicate piercing by insect larvae" ([[ichneumon wasp|ichneumon]] flies, since they avoid caterpillars that are already parasitised), and is impressed by Poulton's observations of "perhaps the most perfect concealment attained by any butterfly" in the dead leaf butterfly ''[[Kallima]]'', first described by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref name=AmNat&gt;{{cite journal | title=Poulton on the Colors of Animals | author=Cope, E.D. | journal=The American Naturalist |date=October 1890 | volume=24 | issue=286 | pages=927–932 | doi=10.1086/275204 | jstor=2451790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While admiring of Poulton's detailed observations, Cope is critical of his support for Darwin, arguing that Poulton fails to explain how the variability that natural selection needs to work on actually arises. (The mechanisms of [[mutation]] and [[genetics]] were not to become adequately understood until the [[history of genetics|twentieth century rediscovery]] of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]]'s work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elof Axel Carlson]], ''Mendel's Legacy: The Origin of Classical Genetics''. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Cope also objects to Poulton's  critique of [[Lamarckism]], where in a footnote he cites [[Sydney Barber Josiah Skertchly|S.B.J. Skertchly]]{{efn|[[Sydney Barber Josiah Skertchly]] (1850–1927), author with Alfred Tylor of ''Colouration in Animals and Plants'', Alabaster, Passmore and sons, 1886, and member of the [[Royal Society of Queensland]].}} as writing that "other butterflies ''noticed this immunity [and] copied it'',&lt;ref group=P&gt;Poulton, 1890. pp 224–225.&lt;/ref&gt; to which Cope replies as that "even the American Neo-Lamarckians [like Cope] do not follow their founder so far as to believe that the volition of an animal could account for all the details of mimetic resemblance."&lt;ref name=AmNat/&gt;

====''Science'' journal====

''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' reviewed the book in November 1890. The reviewer remarks that "It is impossible in this brief notice to do full justice to the wealth of interesting examples with which the author presents us", and notes that unlike the "hackneyed" examples of mimicry and camouflage in other textbooks, "Many of the observations are original."&lt;ref name=Science&gt;{{cite journal | title=Book-Reviews: The Colours of Animals, Their Meaning and Use, Especially Considered in the Case of Insects by Edward Bagnall Poulton | author=Anon | journal=Science |date=21 November 1890 | volume=16 | issue=407 | pages=286 | doi=10.1126/science.ns-16.407.286 | jstor=1767453}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer remarks, also, on the "decided antithesis between warning and protective colors", animals being either "as conspicuous as possible", or as cryptic as possible, while the conspicuous ones "are usually accompanied by a nauseating taste, strongly smelling or irritant fluids, etc."&lt;ref name=Science/&gt;

The reviewer notes more critically that additional examples of mimicry might have been given, such as of [[Hymenoptera]] (bees and wasps) mimicked by [[Diptera]] (flies), and would have liked fuller treatment of Bates's "South American heliconids and pierids".&lt;ref name=Science/&gt; The reviewer finds the closing chapters on "colors used in courtship" the most interesting of the book, since zoologists disagreed widely on the subject, and notes that Poulton sided with Darwin and against Wallace "who denies that the so-called secondary sexual characters" can "owe their origin to sexual selection".&lt;ref name=Science/&gt; The reviewer, siding with Poulton, writes that "It would be difficult, we believe, to explain many of the facts cited by Poulton, notably Peckham's observations on the courtship of spiders, from Wallace's standpoint."&lt;ref name=Science/&gt; The review ends with a brief discussion of Poulton's table classifying animal coloration, predicting (correctly) that the "Greek derivatives" such as pseudaposematic and pseudepisematic will not be generally adopted.&lt;ref name=Science/&gt;

====''British Medical Journal''====

The ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' reviewed the book in July 1890.&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=20239661 | title=Reviews and Notices: The Colours of Animals. By G. B. Poulton (sic) | author=Anon | journal=British Medical Journal |date=5 July 1890 | volume=2 | issue=1540 | pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review begins by noting that the pre-Darwinian view of colour "to-day appears almost ridiculous", adding that "we now know" that colour is of benefit to the animal, and is subject to natural selection. The reviewer writes that it is among [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths) that "protective resemblance or 'cryptic coloration' is most beautifully illustrated, and the book teems with instances" of these, noting that Poulton had "made this part of the subject his own". The review quotes examples including the twig larvae of the Brimstone moth and the "terrifying attitude" of the Puss moth caterpillar.&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt;

The reviewer, noting Wallace's different opinion, has no difficulty with Poulton's view of sexual selection, that it is "due to an aesthetic sense in the [female] animals",&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt; and likes Poulton's expression that "Natural Selection is a qualifying examination which must be passed by all candidates for honours; Sexual Selection is an honours examination in which many who have passed the previous examination will be rejected."&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt; The review objects to the "thick type headings to the subdivision of chapters" which it finds too much like "the 'new journalism'". It concludes by urging readers to compare the book with Darwin's ''[[Descent of Man]]'' and with Wallace's ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]''.&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt;

===Modern view===

Poulton was a staunch supporter of Darwin, through a period when there was no adequate theory of heredity and both natural selection and sexual selection had become unpopular among scientists, and was attacked for his support both in ''The Colours of Animals'' and outside it. And he is recognised as the first scientist to identify frequency-dependent selection, as described in this book.&lt;ref name=Mallet&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/poulton90.html | title=E.B. Poulton (1890) | publisher=University College London | accessdate=23 November 2012 | author=Mallet, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1919, the book was being described in ''Nature'' as a classic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Wild Birds and Distasteful Insect Larvæ | author=Speyer, Edward R | journal=Nature | year=1919 | volume=103 | issue=2597 | pages=445–446 | doi=10.1038/103445b0 | bibcode=1919Natur.103..445S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poulton is paid homage by J.A. Allen and B.C. Clarke for his pioneering work on frequency-dependent selection "by predators acting on non-mimetic [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] prey (i.e. for [[apostatic selection]]), anticipating many of the points made by later workers. We draw attention to his remarkable insight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00802.x/abstract | title=Frequency dependent selection: homage to E. B. Poulton |author1=Allen, J.A. |author2=Clarke, B.C. | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |date=September 1984 | volume=23 | issue=1 | pages=15–18 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00802.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' comments that Poulton's book "concisely and simply explained the many forms of coloration in terms of natural selection; these forms he ingeniously summarized in a comparative table introducing terms which became the standard nomenclature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35586| title=Poulton, Sir Edward Bagnall (1856–1943)|last=Carpenter |first=G. D. H |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (online, free) |publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=30 April 2013|authorlink=Geoffrey Douglas Hale Carpenter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''The Ant and the Peacock: Altruism and Sexual Selection from Darwin to Today'', the [[Darwinian]] [[philosopher]] and [[rationalist]] [[Helena Cronin]] writes that in ''The Colours of Animals'', Poulton defended Darwin's theory of sexual selection, stressing the role of female choice. She suggests that while people have therefore taken Poulton for a staunch Darwinist and supporter of sexual selection, he "lost his initial enthusiasm for the theory" and "came to relegate it to a very minor position" in evolution. She writes that Poulton's position was highly influential, stating that later "Darwinian experts on coloration" followed his views, citing [[Frank Evers Beddard]]'s 1892 ''[[Animal Coloration (1892 book)|Animal Coloration]]'' as evidence.&lt;ref name=Cronin&gt;{{cite book | title=The Ant and the Peacock: Altruism and Sexual Selection from Darwin to Today | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Cronin, Helena | year=1993 | pages=163 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0wTY3z3nggC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Introduction to [[Hugh Bamford Cott]]'s 1940 book ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'', [[Julian Huxley]] praised Cott's work as "a worthy successor to Sir Edward Poulton's ''The Colours of Animals''... The one was a pioneer study, the other is in many respects the last word on the subject''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1940 | author=Cott, Hugh | chapter=Introduction | pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water Sky Garden''' is a sculptural environment designed by artist [[Janet Echelman]]. The garden is located outside the [[Richmond Olympic Oval]], an official venue for the [[2010 Vancouver Olympics|2010 Vancouver Olympic Games]]. The installation consists of a wetland treatment [[pond]], 300&amp;nbsp;ft. [[boardwalk]], two 52&amp;nbsp;ft. pedestrian [[bridge]]s, two net [[sculpture]]s, and a [[fountain]].

==Design==
[[File:ROO_Echelman_PhotoPeterVanderwarker_4238_YYMGJH.jpg|left|thumb|262x262px|Water Sky Garden, Vancouver]]
The boardwalk and "sky lanterns" were inspired by Richmond's cultural communities. Richmond's [[immigrant]] population is the highest of any city in Canada.&lt;ref name="population"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/richmondnews/news/story.html?id=add39b4e-452d-454b-b7a8-f35890156593&amp;k=7115|title=Richmond has highest percentage of immigrants in Canada|accessdate=2010-01-15|publisher=CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of these immigrants are of Asian descent.&lt;ref name="Asian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=5915015&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=59&amp;Data=&amp;SearchText=&amp;SearchType=&amp;SearchPR=&amp;B1=Population|title=2001 Community Profile|accessdate=2010-01-15|publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boardwalk was designed to resemble the choreography of the [[Dragon dance|Dragon Dance]], a performance frequently used in Chinese festivals. The [[Nitobe Memorial Garden]] and [[Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden|Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Chinese Garden]], both in Vancouver, were important inspirations for paths, ponds and framing of the garden's landscape.&lt;ref name="FormandFunction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/sports/2010wintergames/going-to-games/Form+function+meet+Richmond+Olympic+Oval/1195061/story.html|title=Form and function meet at Richmond Olympic Oval|accessdate=2010-01-15|publisher=CanWest News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boardwalk was designed to encourage people to linger and view the 

garden.

[[File:Snowywaterskygarden.jpg|left|thumb|Snowy day at Water Sky Garden]]
The pond collects rainwater from the Oval's roof and surrounding landscape. It is then purified and re-circulated to be used to [[irrigate]] the plants in the surrounding space, provide clean water for the Oval, and empty into the adjacent [[Fraser river|Fraser River]].&lt;ref name="FormandFunction"/&gt; Aeration for the pond is provided by a fountain on the South side of the garden.

The "sky lanterns" are made of ultraviolet-resistant [[PTFE fiber]] nets, supported by painted galvanized steel rings. At night, the lanterns are lit with submerged lights, and the boardwalk is lit with [[LED]] spotlights. The eastern lantern is 75&amp;nbsp;ft. at its largest [[diameter]], and the netting is 25&amp;nbsp;ft. deep. The northern lantern is 52&amp;nbsp;ft. at its largest diameter. Its net is 25&amp;nbsp;ft. deep with a 14&amp;nbsp;ft. tail that descends to the pond below. The garden was designed so that participants can both look at and look through the netted sculptures without obstructing the view of the Oval building or the surrounding garden area.

The initial design process began with the creation of a three-dimensional computer model created using custom software. Those forms were then translated into [[CAD software]] in order to define the geometry and surfaces of the sculpture. These digital structures were then exported to a gravity and wind simulator in order to determine the necessary twine tenacity to withstand strong winds. From this information, construction drawings are created which include specific looming patterns, color information, and lengths of meshes.

'''Waterways''' is a residential suburb located in [[Melbourne]]'s south approximately 25km south of the Melbourne CBD. Originally a housing development, it is just east of [[Mordialloc, Victoria|Mordialloc]].
It is Australia's only suburb that's 20% parkland and 40% water. Over 46 hectares of wildlife sanctuary were artificially created in and around the swampy marshlands of Mordialloc Creek. 

The Waterways suburb location is environmentally sensitive as it is situated directly between two conservation areas, [[Braeside Park]] and the Edithvale wetlands [[Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands]]. Planning permits are strictly regulated and gardens monitored to keep the suburb as native as possible for the abundant wildlife in the area. The Mornington Peninsula branch of the Bird Observers Club of Australia or [http://www.penboc.org.au PENBOC] have documented 105 different species of birds in the area.  For this reason cats are also forbidden.

==History==
Construction on Waterways Estate began in May 2000, due to end within five years. Waterways got its name from its [[waterway]]s which are essentially a number of man made [[wetlands]] and giant lakes in and around the estate. 

The lakes serve as a Melbourne Water filtration system for fresh water flowing down from Dandenong and Mordialloc Creeks then into Port Phillip Bay. 

Although the development was due to be completed in 2006, the developer applied for, and was subsequently granted permission from Kingston Council to increase the suburb's size. The final stage of the development, called Argyle, was completed in July 2011.

Waterways was rated higher than Toorak, Brighton or Canterbury - or anywhere else, apart from the 63 people living on South Wharf - in an index of socio-economic advantage compiled from the 2011 census.

'''Wuḍūʾ''' ({{lang-ar|الوضوء}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|al-wuḍūʼ}}'' {{IPA-ar|wʊˈdˤuːʔ|}}) is the [[Islam]]ic procedure for washing parts of the body, a type of [[ritual purification]], or ablution. ''Wudu'' involves washing the hands, mouth, nostrils, arms, head and feet with water and is an important part of [[ritual purity in Islam]]. What activities require ''wuḍūʾ'', what rituals constitute it and what breaks or invalidates it are governed by ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence)&lt;ref name="GCNEI-477"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glasse|first1=Cyril|title=The New Encyclopeida of Islam|date=2001|publisher=Altmira Press|page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically [[Muslim hygienical jurisprudence|its rules concerning hygiene]].

''Wuḍūʾ'' in other languages is {{lang-fa|آب‌دست or دست‌نماز}} ''{{transl|fa|ābdast or dast-namāz}}'' {{lang-ur|{{nq|وضوء}}}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''{{transl|ur|ALA-LC|wuz&amp;#x324;ūʾ}}'' {{IPA-ur|wʊzuː|IPA}}; {{lang-tr|abdest}}; {{lang-al|abdest}}; {{lang-bn|অযু}} ''{{transl|bn|ôju}}''; [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]]: &lt;span style="font-family: 'Surma';"&gt;'''ꠅꠎꠥ'''&lt;/span&gt; ''{{transl|syl|ozu}}''; {{lang-id|wudhu}}; {{lang-ce|Ламаз эцар/Lamaz ecar}}; {{lang-bs|abdest}}; {{lang-ku|destniwêj (دەست نوێژ)}}; {{lang-so|weeso}}.

''Wuḍūʾ'' is typically done in preparation for formal prayers (''[[salat]]'') and also before handling and reading the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="GCNEI-477"/&gt; Impurifying activities that invalidate ''wudu'' include urination, defecation, flatulence, deep sleep, light bleeding and sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dikmen|first1=Mehmet|title=What are the things that invalidate and break wudu?|url=http://www.questionsonislam.com/article/what-are-things-invalidate-and-break-wudu|website=Questions on Islam|accessdate=3 May 2016|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Wuḍūʾ'' is often translated as "partial ablution", as opposed to ''[[ghusl]]'' ("full ablution"), washing the whole body, or ''[[tayammum]]'' ("dry ablution"), replacing water with sand or dust due to its scarcity, its harmful effect on the person or some other reason.&lt;ref name=zeno-78/&gt; Purification of the body and clothes is called ''taharah''.

==Basis in Quran and hadith==
The [[Qur'an]] says "For [[God in Islam|God]] loves those who turn to Him constantly and He loves those who keep themselves pure and clean."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|222|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to [[Muslim]]s being required to be clean when handling and reading the Qur'an, the Qur'an says "Which none shall touch but those who are clean."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|56|79|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] said that "Cleanliness is half of faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|2|432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water requirements==

===Permitted water types===
*Spring, sea or river water
*Water of melting snow or hail
*Water of a big tank or pond
*Well water

===Prohibited water types===
*Unclean or impure water
*Water extracted from fruit and trees
*Water that has changed its colour, taste and smell and has become thick because something was soaked in it
*Small quantity of water in which something unclean has fallen, e.g. urine, blood, stool or wine or some animal had died after falling into it
*Water left over after drinking by [[haraam]] animals (e.g. pigs or predatory animals)
*Used water of wuḍūʾ or [[ghusl]] (according to the opinion of the [[Hanbali]] School)

==Acts of wudū==

There are four ''[[fard]]'' (obligatory) acts. If one of these acts is omitted, it must be returned to and then the succeeding acts completed.

There are other acts that are performed during wuḍūʾ (coming from the ''[[sunnah]]'' of [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and [[Sunni Islam]]ic scholars) and the detailed acts of the wuḍūʾ can be classed into 3 types:

=== Farā'id according to Sunni Muslims ===
According to Sunni Muslims, the Qur'anic mandate for wuḍūʾ comes in the sixth ''[[Ayah|ayat]]'' of ''[[sura]]'' 5. The [[Ayah|ayat]] has been translated by [[Muhammad Muhsin Khan]], [[Rashad Khalifa]], [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], [[Marmaduke Pickthall|Pickthal]] and [[Maulana Muhammad Ali]] as follows. Note that these scholars' translation refer to washing the feet.

{{Quote|O ye who believe! when ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; Rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands, [[Allah]] doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete His favour to you, that ye may be grateful.|[[Al-Ma'ida]], Sura 5, Ayah 6&lt;ref name="almaidia"&gt;{{Cite quran|5|6|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Washing the face thrice.
* Washing both the arms including the elbows thrice.
* Performing ''[[masah]]'' of one-fourth of the head.
* Washing both the feet once up to and including the ankles. It's not sufficient for one to pass wet hand over the feet or shoes. Under certain conditions masah can be done over leather socks known as khuffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|1|4|182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Narrated by [['Abd Allah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As|Abd-Allah ibn Amr]]: "...we were just passing wet hands over our feet (not washing them thoroughly) so he addressed us in a loud voice saying twice or thrice, 'Save your heels from the fire.'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|1|4|164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Narrated by 'Ubaid Ibn Juraij: "...and he used to perform ablution while wearing the shoes (i.e. wash his feet and then put on the shoes)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|1|4|167}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Narrated by Yahya Al-Mazini: " 'Can you show me how Allah's Apostle used to perform ablution?' ...and washed his feet (up to the ankles)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|1|4|185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Narrated by 'Amr: "...and then he washed his feet up to the ankles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|1|4|186}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Narrated by Humran: "...and washed his feet up to the ankles..."&lt;ref name="buk161"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|1|4|161}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Narrated by 'Amr bin Yahya: "...and washed his feet up to the ankles..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|1|4|190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Narrated by 'Abdullah bin Zaid: "...and washed his feet (up to the ankles)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|1|4|196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Farā'id according to Shia Muslims ===

[[File:Qaed Ibrahim Mosque-Interior (13).jpg|thumb|Muslims performing ablution prior to [[Salat]] or other prayers]]

According to [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] the Qur'anic mandate for wuḍūʾ comes in the sixth ayat of sura 5. The [[Ayah|ayat]] has been translated by [[Muhammad Habib Shakir]] as follows. Note this scholars translation refers to wiping the feet.

{{Quote|O ye who believe! when ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; Rub your heads (with water); and your feet to the ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands, Allah doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete His favour to you, that ye may be grateful.|[[Al-Ma'ida]], Sura 5, Ayah 6&lt;ref name="almaidia"/&gt;}}

* Washing the face once or twice with your right hand.
* Washing both the arms including the elbows once or twice(left hand washed the right arm and then right hand washes the left arm).
* Wiping one fourth of the head with the water left on your right hand.
* Wiping both the feet once up to and including the ankles once with the water remaining on both hands(right hand , right foot. left hand, left foot).

===Mustahabbāt (recommended acts)===
A handful of ''[[mustahabb]]'' (recommended) acts that are considered to make the wuḍūʾ better. If one of these acts is omitted, the wuḍūʾ is still considered valid.

*Reciting the ''[[shahada]]h'' after the ablution.
* During wuḍūʾ one should not engage in worldly talk.
* Choosing a clean place for ablution.
* Not wasting water in ablution.
* Starting from the right side and then the left.

==Contentions==
Muslims who are unable to perform the prevailing form of ablution, due to skin disease, a disability or lack of clean water, etc. are recommended to perform ''[[tayammum]]'', sometimes called "dry ablution", using sand or dust instead of water.&lt;ref name=zeno-78&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeno|first1=Jamil|title=The Pillars of Islam &amp; Iman|date=1996|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an alternative form of ritual purity may also be accepted in cases where one fears the acquisition of [[hypothermia]] in cold weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Urumbuzhi|first1=Muhyadheen|title=Soul of the Quran-Volume 1|date=2010|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==

===According to Sunni Muslims===
Sunni Muslims perform the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|1|4|165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Start by making ''[[niyyah]]'' (intention) to perform wuḍūʾ and cleanse the self of impurities.
*Recite ''[[Basmala|bismillah]]''.
*Wash the right hand up to the wrist (and between the fingers) three times, then similarly for the left hand.
*Next, rinse the mouth and spit out the water three times and rub the teeth with a miswak. If a miswak is not available then one should use the finger;
*Some water should be taken in the right hand and sniffed into the nostrils thrice and then blown out. The left hand should be used for cleaning the nose.
*Wash the face (from the hairline on the forehead to where facial hair begins and ear to ear). This is to be performed three times.
*Wash the entire right arm, including the hand, up to and including the elbow three times; then the left arm three times. Pass fingers of one hand between the fingers of the other hand. If wearing a ring it should be moved freely to allow water to pass under it.
*Then perform masah. Wet hands should be passed all over the head; then the first finger of the right and left hand should be moved in the right and left ears respectively and in the same operation thumbs should be passed around the ears; then pass the backs of the hands over the hind part of the neck only. Hands should not be passed around the fore-neck as it is prohibited. This is only done once. One may ''not'' make masah over a Muslim head cap. 
*Starting with the right foot, wash both feet from the toes up to and including the ankles thrice. The little finger of the left hand should be passed between the toes of both the feet beginning from the little toe of the right foot and ending with the little toe of the left foot.
*Recite the ''[[shahadah]]''.
*Offer two-[[Raka'ah|rak'at]] prayer.
* Make sure all parts of body to be washed for wudu should completely be wet before the other is washed until the wudu is completed.

== Invalidation ==
[[File:Macau Mosque Ablution Tap.JPG|thumb|Wudu tap at [[Macau Mosque]], [[Macau]], [[China]]]]

Theoretically, one can perform one wuḍūʾ for salaat and this wuḍūʾ would be considered valid for the rest of the day. However, traditionally Muslims believe that certain acts invalidate the wuḍūʾ (often referred to as "breaking wuḍūʾ" and "losing wuḍūʾ") and these can be stated generically thus, although the Quran does not explain most of these:

===According to Sunni Muslims===
*Defecation or urination
*Odorous or audible emissions of flatulence
*Emission of semen ([[ghusl]] is required)
*[[Slow-wave sleep]] while reclining
*Vomiting
*Loss of senses
*Fainting
*Sexual contact with another person (ghusl is required)
*Touching the [[Intimate part|private parts]] with the bare hands (not according to Hanafi Madhhab)
*Blood or pus leaving the body so that it leaves the point of exit (however if the blood or pus exits from the private parts then any amount breaks wuḍūʾ). Note that bleeding except from private parts does not invalidate wuḍūʾ according to Shafi'i Madhhab.

==Tayammum==
{{main|Tayammum}}
[[File:Monastir89.jpg|thumbnail|Stone of [[Tayammum]]]]

Tayammum is a "dry ablution" using clean soil or dust, to be performed when water is not readily available to perform ablution or when one is defiled (on ''janabah'') and could not perform ''ghusl'', and is authorised under specific circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://majalla.org/books/law/79.html |title=Tayammum |publisher=Majalla.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wuḍūʾ description in Hadith==
wuḍūʾ in Hadith [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Hurayra]], in reference to the Day of Resurrection, reported that Muhammad, when asked if he would be able to recognise Muslims, said, "Yes, you would have a mark which other people will not have. You would come to me with a white blaze on your foreheads and white marks on your feet because of the traces of ablution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|2|480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Hurayra said, "I have heard prophet (may peace be upon him) say. In a believer adornment would reach the places where ablution reaches."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|2|484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uthman ibn Affan]] stated that Muhammad, said, "He who performed ablution well, his sins would come out from his body, even coming out from under his nails."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|2|476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khattab]] reported that Muhammad said, "No one among you does wuḍūʾ and does wuḍūʾ thoroughly – or adequately – and then testifies, 'There is no god but Allah Alone with no partner and I testify that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger', without the eight doors of the Garden being opened to him so that he can enter by whichever of them he wishes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnipath.com/library/Hadith/H0004P0185.aspx |title=Riyad as-Salihin (The Meadows of the Righteous) by Imam Nawawi |publisher=Sunnipath.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
