The '''1967 Arab League summit''' was held on August 29 in [[Khartoum]] as the fourth [[Arab League Summit]]. The summit came in the aftermath of the Arab defeat to [[Israel]] in the [[Six-Day War]] and is famous for its [[Khartoum Resolution]] known as "The Three No's"; No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=League of Arab States |url=http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/arabic/categoryList.jsp?next=10&amp;level_id=202&amp;image.x=40&amp;image.y=15 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gX4MUKIm?url=http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/arabic/categoryList.jsp?next=10&amp;level_id=202&amp;image.x=40&amp;image.y=15 |archivedate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The summit also resolved that the "oil-rich Arab states" give financial aid to the states who lost the war and to "help them rebuild their military forces."&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Sela|Sela, Avraham]].  "Arab Summit Conferences." ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  Ed. Sela.  New York: Continuum, 2002. pp. 158-160&lt;/ref&gt; The final communique of the meeting "underscored the Palestinians' right to regain the whole of Palestine—that is, to destroy the State of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[[Efraim Karsh|Karsh, Efraim]].  ''Islamic Imperialism: A History''.  New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006.  p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this summit influenced Israeli foreign policy for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Bickerton, Ian J., and Carla L. Klausner.

The '''Acqui Award of History''' (Premio Acqui Storia) is an Italian prize. The prize was founded in 1968 for remembering the victims of the [[Acqui Military Division]] who died in [[Cefalonia]] (September 13–26, 1943) fighting against the [[Nazism|Nazis]].  The jury is composed of seven members: six full professors of history and a group of sixty (60) ordinary readers who have just one representative (and just one vote) in the jury. The Acqui Award Prize is divided into three sections: [[history]], [[popular history]], and [[historical novel]]s.  A special prize entitled “Witness to the Times,” given to individual personalities known for their cultural contributions and who have distinguished themselves in describing historical events and contemporary society, may also be conferred.  Beginning in 2003 special recognition for work in [[multimedia]] and [[iconography]]--”History through Images”—was instituted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">Founded in 1981, the '''American Journalism Historians Association''' ('''AJHA''') seeks to advance education and research in [[mass communication]] history. Through its annual meeting, regional conferences, committees, awards, speakers and publications, members work to raise historical standards and ensure that all scholars and students recognize the vast importance of [[media history]] and apply this knowledge to the advancement of society.

==Meetings and conferences==

===AJHA Annual Meeting===

The organization sponsors an annual fall meeting. Approximately 120 [[historian]]s attend and participate in discussions surrounding teaching and research in media history. Throughout the meeting, scholars present [[peer-review]]ed research, participate in topical panel discussions and generate ideas for articles and books. At the annual meeting, scholars also participate vigorously in a [[silent auction]] that generates thousands of dollars for [[graduate student]] aid.

===AJHA Southeast Symposium===

Media history scholars from across the Southeast gather each February for the annual AJHA Southeast Symposium. The conference is designed to promote graduate and undergraduate research and provides a scholarly forum for student research presentations and discussions.

===AJHA-AEJMC Joint Conference===

The AJHA partners with the History Division of [[AEJMC]] to sponsor a spring conference in New York City. This [[interdisciplinary]] gathering accepts submissions in all areas of journalism and communication history from all time periods and welcomes scholars from all academic disciplines and stages of their academic careers.

==Task Force on History in the Curriculum==

This AJHA committee works to encourage the study of history in graduate and undergraduate mass communication programs. Some of its actions include:
*Encouraging all schools to offer an [[undergraduate]] history course and require it of their majors
*Encouraging graduate schools to recognize that history is as important as theory, [[social science]] research or any other area of graduate study
*Evaluating the history curricula in [[doctorate|doctoral programs]].

==Speakers Bureau==

The AJHA Speakers Bureau features members who share their expertise and knowledge with the media and local and national organizations. The diversity of the organization's membership enables its bureau to provide a wealth of educational resources on a wide variety of topics related to mass communication history.

==Publications==

''American Journalism'' ({{ISSN|0882-1127}}), the AJHA’s [[quarterly]] peer-reviewed journal, publishes articles, research notes, book reviews, and correspondence dealing with media history. Recent editions of ''American Journalism'' are available via the EBSCO database. Contributions may focus on social, economic, intellectual, political or legal issues. ''American Journalism'' also welcomes articles that treat the history of communication in general; the history of broadcasting, advertising, and public relations; the history of media outside the United States; and theoretical issues in the literature or methods of media history.

''The Intelligencer'' is the quarterly newsletter of the AJHA. It includes news about the organization and its members as well as research and conference updates.

==Awards==
*[[Sidney Kobre Award for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism History]] - The organization's highest honor recognizes individuals with an exemplary record of sustained achievement in media history through teaching, research, professional activities, or other contributions to the field.
*Margaret A. Blanchard Dissertation Prize - Awarded annually for the best [[doctoral dissertation]] dealing with mass communication history. A cash award of $500 accompanies the prize.
*AJHA History Award - Recognizes a practicing journalist whose work has been exemplary in the host community of the annual meeting.
*AJHA Teaching Awards - Honors excellence in the teaching of journalism and mass communication history and recognizes those who make a positive impact on student learning and influence other teachers by example. The award is designed to focus national attention on the importance of teaching in journalism and mass communication history.
*AJHA Book Award - Recognizes the best book in media history as judged by a panel of AJHA members. The book award winner is honored at the closing gala of the annual meeting.

During the annual meeting, the AJHA recognizes exceptional peer-reviewed research papers in several categories: faculty paper, student paper, conference paper, minority paper, and women’s interest paper. A panel of judges also presents an award to the single best article published during the year in American Journalism.

'''Antique, classic, heritage, historic, veteran or vintage aircraft''' are aircraft of an obsolete type which have been preserved beyond their normal life.  Their owners are typically [[aviation museum]]s, armed forces or private enthusiasts. Sometimes they may be maintained in an [[airworthiness|airworthy]] condition so that they can be flown at [[air display]]s or on public occasions.  

For example, the [[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]] maintained by the United Kingdom's [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) consists of RAF aircraft from [[World War II]], and regularly takes part in official celebrations, such as its [[flypast]] at the [[wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]] in 2011 &amp;mdash; over 65 years after the aircraft were constructed.

Organizations devoted to such aircraft include the [[Antique Airplane Association]], the [[Historic Aircraft Association]] and the [[Vintage Aircraft Association]].

'''Atlantis''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀτλαντὶς νῆσος}}, "island of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]") is a [[fiction]]al island mentioned within an [[allegory]]{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} on the [[hubris]] of nations in [[Plato]]'s works ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'', where it represents the [[antagonist]] naval power that besieges "Ancient Athens", the [[Counterfactual history|pseudo-historic]] embodiment of Plato's ideal state in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''. In the story, Athens repels the Atlantean attack unlike any other nation of the [[Ecumene|known world]],&lt;ref&gt;Plato's contemporaries pictured the world as consisting of only Europe, Northern Africa, and Western Asia (see the map of [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]). Atlantis, according to Plato, had conquered all Western parts of the known world, making it the literary counter-image of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]].

Despite its minor importance in Plato's work, the Atlantis story has had a considerable impact on literature. The allegorical aspect of Atlantis was taken up in [[utopia]]n works of several [[Renaissance]] writers, such as [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[New Atlantis]]'' and [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lewis |last=Mumford |title=Utopia, the City and the Machine |journal=[[Daedalus (journal)|Daedalus]] |volume=94 |issue=2 |year=1965 |pages=271–292 |jstor=20026910 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hartmann |first1=Anna-Maria |year=2015 |title=The Strange Antiquity of Francis Bacon's ''New Atlantis'' |journal=Renaissance Studies |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=375–393 |doi=10.1111/rest.12084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, nineteenth-century amateur scholars misinterpreted Plato's narrative as historical tradition, most notably in [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]]'s ''[[Atlantis: The Antediluvian World]]''. Plato's vague indications of the time of the events—more than 9,000 years before his time&lt;ref&gt;The [[frame story]] in ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'' tells about an alleged visit of the Athenian lawmaker [[Solon]] (c. 638 BC – 558 BC) to Egypt, where he was told the Atlantis story that supposedly occurred 9,000 years before his time.&lt;/ref&gt;—and the alleged location of Atlantis—"beyond the [[Pillars of Hercules]]"—has led to much [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feder |first=Kenneth |chapter=Lost: One Continent - Reward |title=Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2011 |edition=Seventh |isbn=978-0-07-811697-1 |pages=141–164 |chapterurl={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=8yw5QwAACAAJ |page=141 }} }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Atlantis has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric [[Lost World (genre)|lost civilizations]] and continues to inspire contemporary fiction, from comic books to films.

While present-day [[Philology|philologists]] and [[Classics|classicists]] agree on the story's fictional character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clay |first=Diskin |authorlink=Diskin Clay |chapter=The Invention of Atlantis: The Anatomy of a Fiction |title=Proceedings of the Boston Area Colloquium in Ancient Philosophy |editor-first=John J. |editor-last=Cleary |editor2-first=Gary M. |editor2-last=Gurtler |publisher=E.

Archaeologists broadly agree with the view that Atlantis is quite simply 'utopia' (Doumas, 2007), a stance also taken by classical philologists, who interpret Atlantis as a metaphorical rather than an actual place (Broadie, 2013; Gill, 1979; Nesselrath, 2002). One might consider the question as being already reasonably solved but despite the general expert consensus on the matter, countless attempts have been made at finding Atlantis." ([http://shimajournal.org/issues/v10n2/c.-Dawson-Hayward-Introduction-Shima-v10n2.pdf Dawson &amp; Hayward, 2016])&lt;/ref&gt; there is still debate on what served as its inspiration.

{{main|Timaeus (dialogue)}}

The only primary sources for Atlantis are Plato's dialogues ''Timaeus'' and ''Critias''; all other mentions of the island are based on them. The dialogues claim to quote [[Solon]], who visited Egypt between 590 and 580 BC; they state that he translated Egyptian records of Atlantis.&lt;ref name="ley196706"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 360 BC, Plato introduced Atlantis in ''Timaeus'':

{{quote|For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed the course of a mighty host, which, starting from a distant point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of Europe, and Asia to boot. For the ocean there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeplato|Timaeus|24e–25a}}, [[Robert Gregg Bury|R. G. Bury]] translation (Loeb Classical Library).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The four people appearing in those two dialogues are the politicians [[Critias]] and [[Hermocrates]] as well as the philosophers [[Socrates]] and [[Timaeus of Locri]], although only Critias speaks of Atlantis. In his works Plato makes extensive use of the [[Socratic method]] in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition.

The ''Timaeus'' begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, Socrates muses about the perfect society, described in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c. 380 BC), and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions a tale he considered to be historical, that would make the perfect example, and he then follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the ''Critias''. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the "perfect society" and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the "perfect" traits described in the ''Republic''.

===''Critias''===
{{main|Critias (dialogue)}}

According to Critias, the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] deities of old divided the land so that each deity might have their own lot; [[Poseidon]] was appropriately, and to his liking, bequeathed the island of Atlantis. The island was larger than [[Ancient Libya]] and [[Asia Minor]] combined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9010107/Atlantis |title=Atlantis—Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also it has been interpreted that Plato or someone before him in the chain of the oral or written tradition of the report, accidentally changed the very similar Greek words for "bigger than" ("meson") and "between" ("mezon") – {{cite book|last=Luce|first=J.V.|title=The End of Atlantis – New Light on an Old Legend|year=1969|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal, inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean. Plato asserted that the Egyptians described Atlantis as an island consisting mostly of mountains in the northern portions and along the shore and encompassing a great plain in an oblong shape in the south "extending in one direction three thousand ''[[Stadia (length)|stadia]]'' [about 555&amp;nbsp;km; 345&amp;nbsp;mi], but across the center inland it was two thousand stadia [about 370&amp;nbsp;km; 230&amp;nbsp;mi]." Fifty stadia [9&amp;nbsp;km; 6&amp;nbsp;mi] from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides&amp;nbsp;... broke it off all round about&amp;nbsp;... the central island itself was five stades in diameter [about 0.92&amp;nbsp;km; 0.57&amp;nbsp;mi].

In Plato's metaphorical tale, Poseidon fell in love with Cleito, the daughter of [[Evenor]] and Leucippe, who bore him five pairs of male twins. The eldest of these, [[Atlas of Atlantis|Atlas]], was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean (called the Atlantic Ocean in his honor), and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his [[fiefdom]]. Atlas's twin Gadeirus, or Eumelus in Greek, was given the extremity of the island toward the pillars of Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;The name is a back-formation from ''Gades'', the Greek name for [[Cadiz]].&lt;/ref&gt; The other four pairs of twins—Ampheres and Evaemon, [[Mneseus]] and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor, and Azaes and Diaprepes—were also given "rule over many men, and a large territory."

Poseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular [[moat]]s of increasing width, varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size. The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island. They dug a great canal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats. Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each ring of the city. The walls were constructed of red, white, and black rock, quarried from the moats, and were covered with [[brass]], [[tin]], and the precious metal [[orichalcum]], respectively.

According to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the Pillars of Hercules at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and those who dwelt within them. The Atlanteans had conquered the parts of Libya within the Pillars of Hercules, as far as Egypt, and the European continent as far as [[Tyrrhenia]], and had subjected its people to slavery. The Athenians led an alliance of resistors against the Atlantean empire, and as the alliance disintegrated, prevailed alone against the empire, liberating the occupied lands.

{{quote|But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea. For which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there is a shoal of mud in the way; and this was caused by the subsidence of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Timaeus |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.html |author=[[Plato]] (360 BCE) |translator=[[Benjamin Jowett]] |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Logographer (history)|logographer]] [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] wrote an earlier work entitled ''Atlantis'', of which only a few fragments survive. Hellanicus' work appears to have been a genealogical one concerning the daughters of Atlas (Ἀτλαντὶς in Greek means "of Atlas"),&lt;ref name="Luce"&gt;{{cite book |year=1978 |title=Atlantis, Fact or Fiction? |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-10482-3 |first=John V. |last=Luce |authorlink=John V. Luce |chapter=The Literary Perspective |editor-first=Edwin S. |editor-last=Ramage |page=72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but some authors have suggested a possible connection with Plato's island. [[John V. Luce]] notes that when Plato writes about the genealogy of Atlantis's kings, he writes in the same style as Hellanicus, suggesting a similarity between a fragment of Hellanicus's work and an account in the ''Critias''.&lt;ref name="Luce" /&gt; Rodney Castleden suggests that Plato may have borrowed his title from Hellanicus, who may have based his work on an earlier work about Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;Castleden 2001, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Castleden has pointed out that Plato wrote of Atlantis in 359 BC, when he returned to Athens from Sicily. He notes a number of parallels between the physical organisation and fortifications of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and Plato's description of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;Castleden 2001, pp. 156–158.&lt;/ref&gt; Gunnar Rudberg was the first who elaborated upon the idea that Plato's attempt to realize his political ideas in the city of Syracuse could have heavily inspired the Atlantis account.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gunnar Rudberg|Rudberg, G.]] (1917/2012). ''Atlantis och Syrakusai'', 1917; English: ''Atlantis and Syracuse'', 2012. {{ISBN|978-3-8482-2822-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

===Ancient===
Some ancient writers viewed Atlantis as fictional or metaphorical myth; others believed it to be real.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinz-Günther Nesselrath|Nesselrath, HG]] (2005). 'Where the Lord of the Sea Grants Passage to Sailors through the Deep-blue Mere no More: The Greeks and the Western Seas', ''Greece &amp; Rome'', vol. 52, pp.&amp;nbsp;153–171 [pp. 161–171].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] believed that Plato, his teacher, had invented the island to teach philosophy.{{r|ley196706}} The philosopher [[Crantor]], a student of Plato's student [[Xenocrates]], is cited often as an example of a writer who thought the story to be historical fact. His work, a commentary on ''Timaeus'', is lost, but [[Proclus]], a [[Neoplatonist]] of the fifth century AD, reports on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeplato|Timaeus|24a|grc}}: {{lang|grc|τὰ γράμματα λαβόντες}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage in question has been represented in the modern literature either as claiming that Crantor visited Egypt, had conversations with priests, and saw hieroglyphs confirming the story, or, as claiming that he learned about them from other visitors to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron 2002{{full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proclus wrote:

{{quote|As for the whole of this account of the Atlanteans, some say that it is unadorned history, such as Crantor, the first commentator on Plato. Crantor also says that Plato's contemporaries used to criticize him jokingly for not being the inventor of his Republic but copying the institutions of the Egyptians. Plato took these critics seriously enough to assign to the Egyptians this story about the Athenians and Atlanteans, so as to make them say that the Athenians really once lived according to that system.}}

The next sentence is often translated "Crantor adds, that this is testified by the prophets of the Egyptians, who assert that these particulars [which are narrated by Plato] are written on pillars which are still preserved." But in the original, the sentence starts not with the name Crantor but with the ambiguous ''He''; whether this referred to Crantor or to Plato is the subject of considerable debate. Proponents of both Atlantis as a metaphorical myth and Atlantis as history have argued that the pronoun refers to Crantor.&lt;ref&gt;Castleden 2001, p,168&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Cameron argues that the pronoun should be interpreted as referring to Plato, and that, when Proclus writes that "we must bear in mind concerning this whole feat of the Athenians, that it is neither a mere myth nor unadorned history, although some take it as history and others as myth", he is treating "Crantor's view as mere personal opinion, nothing more; in fact he first quotes and then dismisses it as representing one of the two unacceptable extremes".&lt;ref name="Cameron 1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cameron |first=Alan |title=Crantor and Posidonius on Atlantis |journal=The Classical Quarterly |series=New Series |volume=33 |issue=1 |year=1983 |pages=81–91 |doi=10.1017/S0009838800034315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron also points out that whether ''he'' refers to Plato or to Crantor, the statement does not support conclusions such as Otto Muck's "Crantor came to Sais and saw there in the temple of [[Neith]] the column, completely covered with hieroglyphs, on which the history of Atlantis was recorded. Scholars translated it for him, and he testified that their account fully agreed with Plato's account of Atlantis"&lt;ref&gt;Muck, Otto Heinrich, ''The Secret of Atlantis'', Translation by Fred Bradley of ''Alles über Atlantis'' (Econ Verlag GmbH, Düsseldorf-Wien, 1976), Times Books, a division of Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co., Inc., Three Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016, 1978. {{ISBN|978-0-671-82392-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or J. V. Luce's suggestion that Crantor sent "a special enquiry to Egypt" and that he may simply be referring to Plato's own claims.&lt;ref name="Cameron 1983"/&gt;

Another passage from the commentary by Proclus on the "Timaeus" gives a description of the geography of Atlantis: &lt;blockquote&gt;That an island of such nature and size once existed is evident from what is said by certain authors who investigated the things around the outer sea. For according to them, there were seven islands in that sea in their time, sacred to [[Persephone]], and also three others of enormous size, one of which was sacred to Hades, another to Ammon, and another one between them to Poseidon, the extent of which was a thousand stadia [200&amp;nbsp;km]; and the inhabitants of it—they add—preserved the remembrance from their ancestors of the immeasurably large island of Atlantis which had really existed there and which for many ages had reigned over all islands in the Atlantic sea and which itself had like-wise been sacred to Poseidon. Now these things Marcellus has written in his ''Aethiopica''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Proclus]], ''Commentary on Plato's Timaeus'', p. 117.10–30 (=''FGrHist'' 671 F 1), trans. Taylor, Nesselrath.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marcellus remains unidentified.

Other ancient historians and philosophers who believed in the existence of Atlantis were [[Strabo]] and [[Posidonius]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 2.3.6&lt;/ref&gt; Some have theorized that, before the sixth century BC, the "Pillars of Hercules" may have applied to mountains on either side of the [[Gulf of Laconia]], and also may have been part of the pillar cult of the Aegean.&lt;ref name="Davis, J.L 1990"&gt;Davis, J.L. and Cherry, J.F., (1990) "Spatial and temporal uniformitarianism in LCI: Perspectives from Kea and Melos on the prehistory of Akrotiri" in Hardy, D.A and Renfrew, A.C. (Eds)(1990) "Thera and the Aegean World III, Proceedings of the Third International Conference, Santorini, Greece, 3–9 September 1989" (Thera Foundation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Castledon, Rodney 1998 p6"&gt;Castledon, Rodney (1998), "Atlantis Destroyed" (Routledge), p6&lt;/ref&gt; The mountains stood at either side of the southernmost gulf in Greece, the largest in the Peloponnese, and it opens onto the Mediterranean Sea. This would have placed Atlantis in the Mediterranean, lending credence to many details in Plato's discussion.

The fourth-century historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], relying on a lost work by [[Timagenes]], a historian writing in the first century BC, writes that the [[Druids]] of [[Gaul]] said that part of the inhabitants of Gaul had migrated there from distant islands. Some have understood Ammianus's testimony as a claim that at the time of Atlantis's sinking into the sea, its inhabitants fled to western Europe; but Ammianus, in fact, says that "the Drasidae (Druids) recall that a part of the population is indigenous but others also migrated in from islands and lands beyond the [[Rhine]]" (''Res Gestae'' 15.9), an indication that the immigrants came to Gaul from the north (Britain, the Netherlands, or Germany), not from a theorized location in the Atlantic Ocean to the south-west.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick-Matthews, Keith. ''[http://www.kmatthews.org.uk/cult_archaeology/lost_continents.html Lost Continents: Atlantis].''&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the Celts who dwelled along the ocean were reported to venerate twin gods, ([[Dioscori]]), who appeared to them coming from that ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4A.html] [[Bibliotheca historica]] – [[Diodorus Siculus]] 4.56.4: ''"And the writers even offer proofs of these things, pointing out that the Celts who dwell along the ocean venerate the Dioscori above any of the gods, since they have a tradition handed down from ancient times that these gods appeared among them coming from the ocean. Moreover, the country which skirts the ocean bears, they say, not a few names which are derived from the Argonauts and the Dioscori."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish and Christian===
During the early [[first century]], the Hellenistic Jewish philosopher [[Philo]] wrote about the destruction of Atlantis in his ''On the Eternity of the World'', xxvi. 141, in a longer passage allegedly citing Aristotle's successor [[Theophrastus]]:&lt;ref&gt;T. Franke, ''Aristotle and Atlantis'', 2012; pp.&amp;nbsp;131–133&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;And the island of Atalantes [translator's spelling; original: "{{lang|grc|Ἀτλαντίς}}"] which was greater than Africa and Asia, as Plato says in the Timaeus, in one day and night was overwhelmed beneath the sea in consequence of an extraordinary earthquake and inundation and suddenly disappeared, becoming sea, not indeed navigable, but full of gulfs and eddies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book35.html |title=Philo: On the Eternity of the World |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date=2 February 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is the possibility that [[Clement of Rome]] cryptically referred to Atlantis in his [[First Epistle of Clement]], 20: 8:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;The ocean which is impassable for men, and the worlds beyond it, are directed by the same ordinances of the Master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-lightfoot.html |title=First Clement: Clement of Rome |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date= |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The theologian [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] (''Apostolic Fathers'', 1885, II, p.&amp;nbsp;84) noted on this passage: "Clement may possibly be referring to some known, but hardly accessible land, lying without the pillars of Hercules. But more probably he contemplated some unknown land in the far west beyond the ocean, like the fabled Atlantis of Plato&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot, translator, ''The Apostolic Fathers'', II, 1885, P. 84, Edited &amp; Revised by Michael W. Holmes, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early Christian writers wrote about Atlantis, although they had mixed views on whether it once existed or was an untrustworthy myth of pagan origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp|De Camp, LS]] (1954). ''[[Lost Continents|Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature]]''. New York: Gnome Press, p. 307. {{ISBN|978-0-486-22668-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] believed Atlantis was once real and wrote that in the Atlantic Ocean once existed "[the isle] that was equal in size to Libya or Asia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0401.htm |title=CHURCH FATHERS: On the Pallium (Tertullian) |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to Plato's geographical description of Atlantis.

[[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] in the sixth century wrote of Atlantis in his ''[[Christian Topography]]'' in an attempt to prove his theory that the world was flat and surrounded by water:&lt;ref name="Indicopleustes2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cosmas Indicopleustes|title=The Christian Topography of Cosmas, an Egyptian Monk: Translated from the Greek, and Edited with Notes and Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cp9S9o5lj5oC|date=24 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-01295-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;In like manner the philosopher Timaeus also describes this Earth as surrounded by the Ocean, and the Ocean as surrounded by the more remote earth. For he supposes that there is to westward an island, Atlantis, lying out in the Ocean, in the direction of Gadeira (Cadiz), of an enormous magnitude, and relates that the ten kings having procured mercenaries from the nations in this island came from the earth far away, and conquered Europe and Asia, but were afterwards conquered by the Athenians, while that island itself was submerged by God under the sea. Both Plato and Aristotle praise this philosopher, and Proclus has written a commentary on him. He himself expresses views similar to our own with some modifications, transferring the scene of the events from the east to the west. Moreover he mentions those ten generations as well as that earth which lies beyond the Ocean. And in a word it is evident that all of them borrow from Moses, and publish his statements as their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roger Pearse |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cosmas_12_book12.htm |title=Cosmas Indicopleustes, Christian Topography (1897) pp. 374-385.

A [[Hebrew language]] treatise on computational [[astronomy]] dated to AD 1378/79, alludes to the Atlantis myth in a discussion concerning the determination of zero points for the calculation of longitude:{{original research inline|date=July 2012}}{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

{{quote|Some say that they [the inhabited regions] begin at the beginning of the western ocean [the Atlantic] and beyond.

===Modern===
Aside from Plato's original account, modern interpretations regarding Atlantis are an amalgamation of diverse, speculative movements that began in the sixteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Feder|Feder, KL.]] ''Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology,'' Mountain View, Mayfield 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-07-811697-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; when scholars began to identify Atlantis with the [[New World]]. [[Francisco Lopez de Gomara]] was the first to state that Plato was referring to America, as did [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]]; Janus Joannes Bircherod said in 1663 ''orbe novo non novo'' ("the New World is not new"). [[Athanasius Kircher]] accepted Plato's account as literally true, describing Atlantis as a small continent in the Atlantic Ocean.{{r|ley196706}}

Contemporary perceptions of Atlantis share roots with [[Mayanism]], which can be traced to the beginning of the [[Modern Age]], when European imaginations were fueled by their initial encounters with the indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref name="Hoopes 2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hoopes, John W. |chapter=Mayanism Comes of (New) Age |editor=Joseph Gelfer |title=2012: Decoding the Counterculture Apocalypse |year=2011 |location=London |publisher=Equinox Publishing  |isbn=978-1-84553-639-8 |pages=38–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this era sprang [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] and [[utopian]] visions that would inspire many subsequent generations of theorists.&lt;ref name="Hoopes 2011"/&gt;

Most of these interpretations are considered [[pseudohistory]], [[pseudoscience]], or [[pseudoarchaeology]], as they have presented their works as [[academic]] or [[scientific]], but lack the standards or criteria.

The Flemish cartographer and geographer [[Abraham Ortelius]] is believed to have been the first person to imagine that the continents were joined together before [[continental drift|drifting]] to their present positions. In the 1596 edition of his ''Thesaurus Geographicus'' he wrote: "Unless it be a fable, the island of Gadir or Gades {{bracket|[[Cadiz]]}} will be the remaining part of the island of Atlantis or America, which was not sunk (as Plato reports in the ''Timaeus'') so much as torn away from Europe and Africa by earthquakes and flood... The traces of the ruptures are shown by the projections of Europe and Africa and the indentations of America in the parts of the coasts of these three said lands that face each other to anyone who, using a map of the world, carefully considered them. So that anyone may say with [[Strabo]] in Book 2, that what Plato says of the island of Atlantis on the authority of Solon is not a figment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortelius|first=Abraham|title=Thesaurus Geographicus|url={{Google books|id=AWhXAAAAcAAJ|page=RA1-PR24|plainurl=yes}}|chapter=Gadiricus|date=1596|publisher=Plantin|place=Antwerp|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atlantis pseudohistory====

=====Early influential literature=====
The term "[[utopia]]" (from "no place") was coined by [[Sir Thomas More]] in his sixteenth-century work of [[fiction]] ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Callahan, Tim, Friedhoffer, Bob, and Pat Linse |year=2001 |title=The Search for Atlantis! |journal=Skeptic |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=96 |issn=1063-9330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by [[Plato]]'s Atlantis and travelers' accounts of the [[Americas]], More described an imaginary land set in the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hoopes, John W. |chapter=Mayanism Comes of (New) Age |editor=Joseph Gelfer |title=2012: Decoding the Counterculture Apocalypse |year=2011 |location=London |publisher=Equinox Publishing  |isbn=978-1-84553-639-8 |pages=38–59 [p. 46] }}&lt;/ref&gt; His idealistic vision established a connection between the Americas and utopian societies, a theme that Bacon discussed in ''[[New Atlantis|The New Atlantis]]'' (c. 1623).&lt;ref name="Hoopes 2011"/&gt; A character in the narrative gives a history of Atlantis that is similar to Plato's and places Atlantis in America. People had begun believing that the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and [[Aztec]] ruins could possibly be the remnants of Atlantis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Impact of Mayanism=====
Much speculation began as to the origins of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], which led to a variety of narratives and publications that tried to rationalize the discoveries within the context of the [[Bible]] and that had undertones of [[racism]] in their connections between the Old and New World. The [[Europeans]] believed the [[indigenous people]] to be inferior and incapable of building that which was now in ruins and by sharing a common history, they insinuate that another race must have been responsible.

In the middle and late nineteenth century, several renowned [[Mesoamerica]]n scholars, starting with [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]], and including [[Edward Herbert Thompson]] and [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], formally proposed that Atlantis was somehow related to Mayan and [[Aztec]] culture.

The French scholar Brasseur de Bourbourg traveled extensively through Mesoamerica in the mid-1800s, and was renowned for his translations of [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] texts, most notably the sacred book [[Popol Vuh]], as well as a comprehensive history of the region. Soon after these publications, however, Brasseur de Bourbourg lost his academic credibility, due to his claim that the [[Maya peoples]] had descended from the [[Toltecs]], people he believed were the surviving population of the racially superior civilization of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Evans, R. Tripp |year=2004 |title=Romancing the Maya: Mexican Antiquity in the American Imagination, 1820–1915 |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-70247-7 |page=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work combined with the skillful, romantic illustrations of [[Jean Frederic Waldeck]], which visually alluded to [[Egypt]] and other aspects of the [[Old World]], created an authoritative [[fantasy]] that excited much interest in the connections between worlds.

Inspired by Brasseur de Bourbourg's diffusion theories, the pseudoarchaeologist Augustus Le Plongeon traveled to Mesoamerica and performed some of the first [[excavations]] of many famous Mayan ruins. Le Plongeon invented narratives, such as the kingdom of [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]] saga, which romantically drew connections to him, his wife Alice, and [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] deities [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]], as well as to [[Heinrich Schliemann]], who had just discovered the ancient city of [[Troy]] from [[Homer]]'s [[epic poetry]] (that had been described as merely mythical).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Evans, R. Tripp |year=2004 |title=Romancing the Maya: Mexican Antiquity in the American Imagination, 1820–1915 |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-70247-7 |pages=141–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that he had found connections between the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Mayan languages]], which produced a [[narrative]] of the destruction of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brunhouse, Robert L. |year=1973 |title=In Search of the Maya: The First Archaeologists |location=Albuquerque |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |isbn=0-8263-0276-9 |page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ignatius Donnelly=====
The 1882 publication of ''[[Atlantis: the Antediluvian World]]'' by [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] stimulated much popular interest in Atlantis. He was greatly inspired by early works in [[Mayanism]], and like them, attempted to establish that all known [[ancient civilizations]] were descended from Atlantis, which he saw as a technologically sophisticated, more advanced [[culture]]. Donnelly drew parallels between creation stories in the Old and New Worlds, attributing the connections to Atlantis, where he believed the Biblical [[Garden of Eden]] existed.&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly 1941: 192-203&lt;/ref&gt; As implied by the title of his book, he also believed that Atlantis was destroyed by the [[Great Flood]] mentioned in the Bible.

Donnelly is credited as the "father of the nineteenth century Atlantis revival" and is the reason the [[myth]] endures today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Williams, Stephen |year=1991 |title=Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-8238-8 |pages=137–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He unintentionally promoted an alternative method of inquiry to history and science, and the idea that myths contain hidden information that opens them to "ingenious" interpretation by people who believe they have new or special insight.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Paul (2006). "Esoteric Egypt". In Garrett G. Fagan. Archaeological Fantasies. London and New York: Routledge. pp. 23–46. {{ISBN|978-0-415-30593-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophists=====
[[File:Map of Atlantis.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|&lt;center&gt;Map of Atlantis according to [[William Scott-Elliott]] (''The Story of Atlantis'', Russian edition, 1910)&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Russian mystic [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] and her partner [[Henry Steel Olcott]] founded their [[Theosophical Society]] in the 1870s with a philosophy that combined western [[romanticism]] and [[eastern world|eastern]] religious concepts. Blavatsky and her followers in this group are often cited as the founders of [[New Age]] and other spiritual movements.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Blavatsky took up [[Donnelly]]'s interpretations when she wrote ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), which she claimed was originally dictated in Atlantis. She maintained that the Atlanteans were cultural heroes (contrary to [[Plato]], who describes them mainly as a military threat). She believed in a form of racial [[evolution]] (as opposed to primate evolution), in which the Atlanteans were the fourth "[[Root Race]]", succeeded by the fifth and most superior "[[Aryan race]]" (the modern human race).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The [[Theosophists]] believed that the civilization of Atlantis reached its peak between 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago, but destroyed itself through internal [[warfare]] brought about by the dangerous use of [[psychic]] and [[supernatural]] powers of the inhabitants. [[Rudolf Steiner]], the founder of [[anthroposophy]] and [[Waldorf Schools]], along with other well known Theosophists, such as [[Annie Besant]], also wrote of [[cultural]] evolution in much the same vein.

Some subsequent occultists have followed Blavatsky, at least to the point of tracing the lineage of occult practices back to Atlantis. Among the most famous is [[Dion Fortune]] in her ''Esoteric Orders and Their Work''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Esoteric Orders and Their Work |url=http://www.ourladyisgod.com/images/eBooks/Dion_Fortune_-_Esoteric_Orders_And_Their_Work_cd6_id1971727491_size183.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nazism and occultism=====
{{See also|Nazism and occultism}}

[[Blavatsky]] was also inspired by the work of the eighteenth-century [[astronomer]] [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]], who had "Orientalized" the Atlantis [[myth]] in his mythical continent of [[Hyperborea]], a reference to [[Greek myths]] featuring a Northern European region of the same name, home to a giant, godlike race.&lt;ref name="Edelstein 2006: 268"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edelstein, Dan |year=2006 |title=Hyperborean Atlantis: Jean-Sylvain Bailly, Madame Blavatsky, and the Nazi Myth |journal=Studies in eighteenth-century culture |volume=35 |pages=267–291 [p. 268] |issn=0360-2370 |doi=10.1353/sec.2010.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Edelstein claims that her reshaping of this theory in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' provided the [[Nazism|Nazis]] with a mythological precedent and a pretext for their ideological platform and [[The Holocaust|their subsequent genocide]].&lt;ref name="Edelstein 2006: 268" /&gt; However, Blavatsky's writings mention that the Atlantean were in fact olive-skinned peoples with Mongoloid traits who were the ancestors of modern [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Mongolia]]ns and [[Malayans]].&lt;ref name="Powell-36"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 25-26. (Ch. 36. "The second Atlantean sub-race: the Tlavatli".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-39"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 252-263. (Ch. 39.

[[Julius Evola]]'s writing in 1934 also suggested that the Atlanteans were [[Hyperborean]], [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] supermen who originated at the North Pole (see [[Thule]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Similarly, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] (in ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', 1930) spoke of a "Nordic-Atlantean" or "Aryan-Nordic" master race.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} This ideas may contradict the believes of several Esoteric and Theosophic groups that, on the contrary, thought that the Atlanteans were non-Causian brown skinned peoples. Also some Esoteric groups including the Theosophic Society does not consider Atlantean society to have been superior or Utopian, on the contrary, they consider a lower stage on evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Theosophical Root Races |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/Theosophy/root_races.html |website=Kepher |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Edgar Cayce=====
[[Edgar Cayce]] was a man from humble upbringings in [[Kentucky]] who allegedly possessed [[psychic]] abilities, which were performed from a trance-like state. In addition to allegedly healing the sick from this state, he also spoke frequently on the topic of Atlantis. In his "life readings," he purportedly revealed that many of his subjects were [[reincarnations]] of people who had lived on Atlantis. By tapping into their [[collective consciousness]], the "[[Akashic Records]]" (a term borrowed from [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]]),&lt;ref&gt;See Tillett, Gregory John ''[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] (1854-1934), a biographical study''. PhD Thesis. [[University of Sydney]], Department of Religious Studies, Sydney, 1986 – [http://leadbeater.org/tillettcwlnotes.htm p. 985].&lt;/ref&gt; he declared that he was able to give detailed descriptions of the lost continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cayce, Edgar Evans |year=1968 |title=Edgar Cayce on Atlantis |location=New York and Boston |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |isbn=0-446-35102-4 |pages=27–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also asserted that Atlantis would "rise" again in the 1960s (sparking much popularity of the myth in that decade) and that there is a "[[Hall of Records]]" beneath the [[Egyptian Sphinx]], which holds the historical texts of Atlantis.

====Recent times====
As [[continental drift]] became widely accepted during the 1960s, and the increased understanding of [[plate tectonics]] demonstrated the impossibility of a lost continent in the geologically recent past,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Greece Before History: An Archaeological Companion and Guide |last=Runnels |first=Curtis |author2=Murray, Priscilla |year=2004 |publisher=Stanford UP |location=Stanford |isbn=0-8047-4036-4 |page=130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rg4rTjo0OCQC&amp;pg=PA130 |accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; most "Lost Continent" theories of Atlantis began to wane in popularity.

Plato scholar [[Julia Annas]], [[Regents Professor]] of Philosophy at the [[University of Arizona]], had this to say on the matter:

{{quote|The continuing industry of discovering Atlantis illustrates the dangers of reading Plato. For he is clearly using what has become a standard device of fiction—stressing the historicity of an event (and the discovery of hitherto unknown authorities) as an indication that what follows is fiction. ''The idea is that we should use the story to examine our ideas of government and power''. We have missed the point if instead of thinking about these issues we go off exploring the sea bed. The continuing misunderstanding of Plato as historian here enables us to see why his distrust of imaginative writing is sometimes justified.&lt;ref&gt;J. Annas, ''Plato: A Very Short Introduction'' (OUP 2003), p.42 ''(emphasis not in the original)''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the proposed explanations for the historical context of the Atlantis story is a warning of Plato to his contemporary fourth-century fellow-citizens against their striving for naval power.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;

[[Kenneth Feder]] points out that Critias's story in the ''Timaeus'' provides a major clue. In the dialogue, Critias says, referring to Socrates' hypothetical society:

{{quote|And when you were speaking yesterday about your city and citizens, the tale which I have just been repeating to you came into my mind, and I remarked with astonishment how, by some mysterious coincidence, you agreed in almost every particular with the narrative of Solon.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;''Timaeus'' 25e, Jowett translation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Feder quotes A. E. Taylor, who wrote, "We could not be told much more plainly that the whole narrative of Solon's conversation with the priests and his intention of writing the poem about Atlantis are an invention of Plato's fancy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Feder|Feder, KL.]] ''Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology,'' Mountain View, Mayfield 1999, p. 164 {{ISBN|978-0-07-811697-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Location hypotheses of Atlantis}}
Since Donnelly's day, there have been dozens of locations proposed for Atlantis, to the point where the name has become a generic concept, divorced from the specifics of Plato's account. This is reflected in the fact that many proposed sites are not within the Atlantic at all. Few today are scholarly or archaeological hypotheses, while others have been made by [[psychic]] (e.g., [[Edgar Cayce]]) or other [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] means. (The Atlantis researchers Jacques Collina-Girard and Georgeos Díaz-Montexano, for instance, each claim the other's hypothesis is pseudoscience.)&lt;ref&gt;Collina-Girard, Jacques, ''L'Atlantide retrouvée: enquête scientifique autour d'un mythe'' (Paris: Belin – pour la science, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the proposed sites share some of the characteristics of the Atlantis story (water, catastrophic end, relevant time period), but none has been demonstrated to be a true historical Atlantis.

The [[Thera eruption]], dated to the seventeenth or sixteenth century BC, caused a large [[tsunami]] that some experts hypothesize devastated the [[Minoan civilization]] on the nearby island of Crete, further leading some to believe that this may have been the catastrophe that inspired the story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6568053.stm The wave that destroyed Atlantis] Harvey Lilley, BBC News Online, 20 April 2007.

Others have noted that, before the sixth century BC, the mountains on either side of the [[Gulf of Laconia]] were called the "Pillars of Hercules",&lt;ref name="Davis, J.L 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Castledon, Rodney 1998 p6"/&gt; and they could be the geographical location being described in ancient reports upon which Plato was basing his story. The mountains stood at either side of the southernmost gulf in Greece, the largest in the [[Peloponnese]], and that gulf opens onto the Mediterranean Sea. If from the beginning of discussions, misinterpretation of Gibraltar as the location rather than being at the Gulf of Laconia, would lend itself to many erroneous concepts regarding the location of Atlantis. Plato may have not been aware of the difference. The Laconian pillars open to the south toward Crete and beyond which is Egypt. The [[Thera eruption]] and the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] affected that area and might have been the devastation to which the sources used by Plato referred. Significant events such as these would have been likely material for tales passed from one generation to another for almost a thousand years.

===In the Atlantic Ocean===
The location of Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean has a certain appeal given the closely related names. Popular culture often places Atlantis there, perpetuating the original Platonic setting as they understand it. The [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira Islands]] have been identified as a possible location,&lt;ref name=Canarias&gt;{{cite book|last=Afonso|first=Leoncio|authorlink=Leoncio Afonso|title=Geografía física de Canarias: Geografía de Canarias|year=1980|publisher=Editorial Interinsular Canaria|isbn=978-84-85543-15-1|page=11|chapter=El mito de la Atlántida|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodríguez Hernández|first=María Jesús|title=Imágenes de Canarias 1764–1927.

Detailed studies of their geomorphology and geology have demonstrated, however, that they have been steadily uplifted, without any significant periods of subsidence, over the last four million years, by geologic processes such as erosional unloading, gravitational unloading, lithospheric flexure induced by adjacent islands, and volcanic underplating.&lt;ref name="MenendezOthers2009"&gt;Menendez, I., P.G.

===In Europe===
[[File:Doggerland.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Map showing hypothetical extent of [[Doggerland]] (c.&amp;nbsp;8,000&amp;nbsp;BC), which provided a land bridge between Great Britain and continental Europe]]
Several hypotheses place the sunken island in northern Europe, including [[Doggerland]] in the [[North Sea]], and [[Sweden]] (by [[Olof Rudbeck]] in ''[[Olof Rudbeck|Atland]]'', 1672–1702). Doggerland, as well as [[Viking Bergen Island]], is thought to have been flooded by a [[megatsunami]] following the [[Storegga slide]] of c. 6100 BC. Some have proposed the [[Celtic Sea#Seabed|Celtic Shelf]] as a possible location, and that there is a link to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lovgren |first=Stefan |title=Atlantis "Evidence" Found in Spain and Ireland |publisher=[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]] |date=19 August 2004 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/08/0819_040819_atlantis.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish scientists have dismissed Freund's speculations, claiming that he sensationalised their work. The anthropologist Juan Villarías-Robles, who works with the [[Spanish National Research Council]], said, "Richard Freund was a newcomer to our project and appeared to be involved in his own very controversial issue concerning King Solomon's search for ivory and gold in [[Tartessos]], the well documented settlement in the Doñana area established in the first millennium BC", and described Freund's claims as "fanciful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Edward|title=Lost city of Atlantis 'buried in Spanish wetlands'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/8381219/Lost-city-of-Atlantis-buried-in-Spanish-wetlands.html|accessdate=18 March 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar theory had previously been put forward by a German researcher, Rainer W.

==Literary interpretations==

===Ancient versions===
[[File:POxy1084 Hellanicus Atlantis.png|thumb|left|upright=0.8|A fragment of ''Atlantis'' by Hellanicus of Lesbos]]
In order to give his account of Atlantis [[Verisimilitude (fiction)|verisimilitude]], Plato mentions that the story was heard by [[Solon]] in Egypt, and transmitted orally over several generations through the family of Dropides, until it reached Critias, a dialogue speaker in ''Timaeus'' and ''Critias''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, O. D. (2016). "The Atlantis Story: An Authentic Oral Tradition?". ''Shima: The International Journal of Research into Island Cultures''. 10(2): 10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Solon had supposedly tried to adapt the Atlantis [[oral tradition]] into a poem (that if published, was to be greater than the works of [[Hesiod]] and [[Homer]]). While it was never completed, Solon passed on the story to Dropides. Modern classicists deny the existence of Solon's Atlantis poem and the story as an oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Tulli, “The Atlantis poem in the Timaeus-Critias”, in ''The Platonic Art of Philosophy'', Cambridge University 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uXRGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA269 pp. 269–282]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Plato is thought to be the sole inventor or fabricator.
[[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] used the word "Atlantis" as the title for a poem published before Plato,&lt;ref&gt;"The following papyrus, 1359, which Grenfell and Hunt identified as also from the Catalogue, is regarded by C. Robert as part of a separate epic, which he calls Atlantis." Bell, H. Idris, "Bibliography: Graeco-Roman Egypt A. Papyri (1915-1919)", ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', Vol. 6, No. 2 (Apr., 1920), pp. 119-146.&lt;/ref&gt; a fragment of which may be [[Oxyrhynchus]] Papyrus 11, 1359.&lt;ref&gt;P.Oxy. 1359. See Carl Robert (1917): ''Eine epische Atlantias'', ''Hermes'', Vol. 52, No. 3 (Jul., 1917), pp. 477-79.&lt;/ref&gt; This work only describes the Atlantides (the daughters of Atlas), however, and has no relation to Plato's Atlantis account.

In the new era, the third century AD [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] Zoticus wrote an epic poem based on Plato's account of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], ''Life of Plotinus'', 7=35.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's work may already have inspired [[parody|parodic]] imitation, however. Writing only a few decades after the ''Timaeus'' and ''Critias'', the historian [[Theopompus]] of [[Chios]] wrote of a land beyond the ocean known as [[Meropis]]. This description was included in Book 8 of his ''Philippica'', which contains a dialogue between [[Silenus]] and King [[Midas]]. Silenus describes the Meropids, a race of men who grow to twice normal size, and inhabit two cities on the island of Meropis: ''Eusebes'' ({{lang|grc|Εὐσεβής}}, "Pious-town") and ''Machimos'' ({{lang|grc|Μάχιμος}}, "Fighting-town"). He also reports that an army of ten million soldiers crossed the ocean to conquer [[Hyperborea]], but abandoned this proposal when they realized that the Hyperboreans were the luckiest people on earth. Heinz-Günther Nesselrath has argued that these and other details of Silenus' story are meant as imitation and exaggeration of the Atlantis story, by parody, for the purpose of exposing Plato's ideas to ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinz-Günther Nesselrath|Nesselrath, HG]] (1998). 'Theopomps Meropis und Platon: Nachahmung und Parodie', ''Göttinger Forum für Altertumswissenschaft'', vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utopias and dystopias===
The creation of [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]]s was renewed after the Renaissance, most notably in Francis Bacon’s ''[[New Atlantis]]'' (1627), the description of an ideal society that he located off the western coast of America. Thomas Heyrick (1649-1694) followed him with “The New Atlantis” (1687), a satirical poem in three parts. His new continent of uncertain location, perhaps even a floating island either in the sea or the sky, serves as background for his exposure of what he described in a second edition as “A True Character of Popery and Jesuitism”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A43565.0001.001?view=toc University of Michigan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of ''[[The New Atalantis]]'' by [[Delarivier Manley]] (1709), distinguished from the two others by the single letter, is an equally dystopian work but set this time on a fictional Mediterranean island.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/secretmemoirsman00manl#page/n5/mode/2up Archived online]&lt;/ref&gt; In it sexual violence and exploitation is made a metaphor for the hypocritical behaviour of politicians in their dealings with the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Nováková, Soňa, [http://www.phil.muni.cz/angl/thepes/thepes_02_17.pdf pp.121-6 “Sex and Politics: Delarivier Manley’s New Atalantis”]&lt;/ref&gt; In Manley’s case, the target of satire was the [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig Party]], while in David Maclean Parry's ''[[The Scarlet Empire]]'' (1906) it is [[Socialism]] as practised in foundered Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=dul1.ark:/13960/t3vt2bh65;view=1up;seq=7 Online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed in Russia by [[Velemir Khlebnikov]]'s poem ''The Fall of Atlantis'' (''Gibel' Atlantidy'', 1912), which is set in a future rationalist dystopia that has discovered the secret of immortality and is so dedicated to progress that it has lost touch with the past. When the high priest of this ideology is tempted by a slave girl into an act of irrationality, he murders her and precipitates a second flood, above which her severed head floats vengefully among the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Thomson, ''Lot's Wife and the Venus of Milo: Conflicting Attitudes to the Cultural Heritage in Modern Russia'', Cambridge University 1978, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y3UTbrInnAoC&amp;pg=PA77 pp.77–8]&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly later work, ''The Ancient of Atlantis'' (Boston, 1915) by Albert Armstrong Manship, expounds the Atlantean wisdom that is to redeem the earth. Its three parts consist of a verse narrative of the life and training of an Atlantean wise one, followed by his Utopian moral teachings and then a psychic drama set in modern times in which a reincarnated child embodying the lost wisdom is reborn on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Archived [https://archive.org/stream/ancientatlantis00mansgoog#page/n15/mode/2up online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hispanic]] eyes, Atlantis had a more intimate interpretation. The land had been a colonial power which, although it had brought civilization to ancient Europe, had also enslaved its peoples. Its tyrannical fall from grace had contributed to the fate that had overtaken it, but now its disappearance had unbalanced the world. This was the point of view of [[Jacint Verdaguer]]’s vast mythological epic ''L’Atlantida'' (1877).  After the sinking of the former continent, Hercules travels east across the Atlantic to found the city of [[Barcelona]] and then departs westward again to the [[Hesperides]]. The story is told by a hermit to a shipwrecked mariner, who is inspired to follow in his tracks and so “call the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old”. This mariner, of course, was [[Christopher Columbus]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hughes, ''Barcelona'', London 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJd9esHdz5YC&amp;pg=PA341&amp;lpg=PA341&amp;dq=Atlantida+%22poem%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Atlantida%20%22poem%22 pp.341-3]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Verdaguer’s poem was written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], but was widely translated in both Europe and Hispano-America.&lt;ref&gt;Isidor Cònsul, [http://www.visat.cat/traduccions-literatura-catalana/eng/ressenyes/85/122/0/3/poesia/jacint-verdaguer.html “The translations of Verdaguer]&lt;/ref&gt; One response was the similarly entitled Argentinian ''Atlantida'' of [[Olegario Victor Andrade]] (1881), which sees in “Enchanted Atlantis that Plato foresaw, a golden promise to the fruitful race” of Latins.&lt;ref&gt;''Obras Poeticas'', [https://archive.org/stream/3202277#page/151/mode/2up/search/atlantida pp.151-166]; there is a translation of canto 8 by [http://www.poetrynook.com/poem/atl%E2%94%9C%C3%ADntida Elijah Clarence Hills]&lt;/ref&gt; The bad example of the colonising world remains, however. [[Jose Juan Tablada]] characterises its threat in his “De Atlántida” (1894) through the beguiling picture of the lost world populated by the underwater creatures of Classical myth, among whom is the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]] of its final stanza with 
::her eye on the keel of the wandering vessel 
::that in passing deflowers the sea’s smooth mirror,
::launching into the night her amorous warbling
::and the dulcet lullaby of her treacherous voice!&lt;ref&gt;Latin American Anthology, [http://homepage.univie.ac.at/friedrich.frosch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/anthologie-poes%C3%ADa-latinoamericana-siglo-XX.pdf p.1]&lt;/ref&gt;
   
There is a similar ambivalence in [[Janus Djurhuus]]’ six-stanza “Atlantis” (1917), where a celebration of the [[Faroese language conflict|Faroese linguistic revival]] grants it an ancient pedigree by linking Greek to Norse legend. In the poem a female figure rising from the sea against a background of Classical palaces is recognised as a priestess of Atlantis. The poet recalls “that the Faroes lie there in the north Atlantic Ocean/ where before lay the poet-dreamt lands,” but also that in Norse belief, such a figure only appears to those about to drown.&lt;ref&gt;Joensen, Leyvoy. “Atlantis, Bábylon, Tórshavn: The Djurhuus Brothers and William Heinesen in Faroese Literary History”. Scandinavian Studies 74.2 (2002), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40920372?seq=12#page_scan_tab_contents pp.192-4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===A land lost in the distance===
[[File:Faroe stamp 493 Djurhuus poems - atlantis.jpg|thumb|A Faroe Islands postage stamp honoring [[Janus Djurhuus]]' "Atlantis" ]]

The fact that Atlantis is a lost land has made of it a metaphor for something no longer attainable. For the American poet Edith Willis Linn Forbes (1865-1945), “The Lost Atlantis” stands for idealisation of the past; the present moment can only be treasured once that is realised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcatpoems.com/f/the_lost_atlantis.html Black Cat poems]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ella Wheeler Wilcox]] finds the location of “The Lost Land” (1910) in one’s carefree youthful past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litscape.com/author/Ella_Wheeler_Wilcox/The_Lost_Land.html  Litscape]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the Irish poet [[Eavan Boland]] in “Atlantis, a lost sonnet” (2007), the idea was defined when “the old fable-makers searched hard for a word/ to convey that what is gone is gone forever”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/atlantis%E2%80%94-lost-sonnet Poets.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

For some male poets too, the idea of Atlantis is constructed from what cannot be obtained. [[Charles Bewley]] in his [[Newdigate Prize]] poem (1910) thinks it grows from dissatisfaction with one’s condition, 
::And, because life is partly sweet 
::And ever girt about with pain, 
::We take the sweetness, and are fain 
::To set it free from grief's alloy
in a dream of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;Google Books [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/charles-bewley/atlantis-the-newdigate-prize-poem-1910-lwe/1-atlantis-the-newdigate-prize-poem-1910-lwe.shtml p.11]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly for the Australian [[Gary Catalano]] in a 1982 prose poem, it is “a vision that sank under the weight of its own perfection”.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Catalano, Heaven of Rags, Sydney 1982, [http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/catalano-gary/atlantis-0359028 Australian Poetry Library]&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. H. Auden]], however, suggests a way out of such frustration through the metaphor of journeying toward Atlantis in his poem of 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/atlantis Poem Hunter]&lt;/ref&gt; While travelling, he advises the one setting out, you will meet with many definitions of the goal in view, only realising at the end that the way has all the time led inward.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bonnie Costello]], “Setting out for Atlantis”, from ''Auden at Work'', Palgrave Macmillan 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AauhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133 pp. 133–53]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epic narratives===
A few late nineteenth century verse narratives complement the [[Atlantis in popular culture#Fiction|genre fiction]] that was beginning to be written at the same period. Two of them report the disaster that overtook the continent as related by long-lived survivors. In [[Frederick Tennyson]]’s ''Atlantis'' (1888) an ancient Greek mariner sails west and discovers an inhabited island, which is all that remains of the former kingdom. He learns of its end and views the shattered remnant of its former glory, from which a few had escaped to set up the Mediterranean civilisations.&lt;ref&gt;In two parts at Black Cat Poems; [http://www.blackcatpoems.com/t/atlantis_part_i.html part 1] and [http://www.blackcatpoems.com/t/atlantis_part_ii.html part 2]&lt;/ref&gt; In the second, ''Mona, Queen of Lost Atlantis: An Idyllic Re-embodiment of Long Forgotten History'' (Los Angeles CA 1925) by James Logue Dryden (1840-1925), the story is told in a series of visions. A Seer is taken to Mona’s burial chamber in the ruins of Atlantis, where she revives and describes the catastrophe. There follows a survey of the lost civilisations of Hyperborea and Lemuria as well as Atlantis, accompanied by much spiritualist lore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ3eIcpA4coC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

William Walton Hoskins (1856-1919) admits to the readers of his ''Atlantis and other poems'' (Cleveland OH, 1881), that he is only 24. Its melodramatic plot concerns the poisoning of the descendant of god-born kings. The usurping poisoner is poisoned in his turn, following which the continent is swallowed in the waves.&lt;ref&gt;Archived online, [https://archive.org/details/atlantisotherpoe00hosk pp.7-127]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian gods people the landscape of ''The Lost Island'' (Ottawa 1889) by Edward Taylor Fletcher (1816–97).

Beecher’s ''The Lost Atlantis or The Great Deluge of All'' (Cleveland OH, 1898) is just a doggerel vehicle for its author’s opinions: that the continent was the location of the Garden of Eden; that Darwin’s theory of evolution is correct, as are Donnelly’s views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t5q81xg08;view=1up;seq=9 Hathi Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlantis was to become a theme in Russia following the 1890s, taken up in unfinished poems by [[Valery Bryusov]] and [[Konstantin Balmont]], as well as in a drama by the schoolgirl [[Larisa Reisner]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Pichler, ''Atlantis als Motiv in der russischen Literatur des 20. Jahrhunderts'', Vienna University 2013, [http://othes.univie.ac.at/25256/1/2013-01-21_0401826.pdf pp.27-30]&lt;/ref&gt; One other long narrative poem was published in New York by George V. Golokhvastoff. His 250-page ''The Fall of Atlantis'' (1938) records how a high priest, distressed by the prevailing degeneracy of the ruling classes, seeks to create an androgynous being from royal twins as a means to overcome this polarity. When he is unable to control the forces unleashed by his occult ceremony, the continent is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Pichler, pp.37-40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The Spanish composer [[Manuel de Falla]] worked on a dramatic cantata based on Verdaguer’s ''L’Atlántida'', during the last 20 years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;There is a performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbO0U3BMEfo You Tube]&lt;/ref&gt; The name has been affixed to symphonies by [[Janis Ivanovs]] (1941),&lt;ref&gt;Symphony 4, of which there is a performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZN83Q11GZg You Tube]&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Nanes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1538965/a/nanes%3A+symphonies+no+1+%26+2+%2F+keith+clark,+london+po.htm Symphony 1], “Atlantis, the sunken city", recorded by the London Philharmonic Orchestra during the 1990s&lt;/ref&gt; and Vaclav Buzek (2009).&lt;ref&gt;A performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvUUfewPZa8 You Tube]&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the symphonic celebration of [[Alan Hovhaness]]: "Fanfare for the New Atlantis" (Op. 281, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/w/122552 Presto Classical]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bohemian-American composer and arranger [[Vincent Frank Safranek]] wrote ''Atlantis (The Lost Continent) Suite in Four Parts''; I. Nocturne and Morning Hymn of Praise, II. A Court Function, III. ″I Love Thee″ (The Prince and Aana), IV. The Destruction of Atlantis, for military (concert) band in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;''The Heritage Encyclopedia of Band Music'' by William H. Rehrig, ed. by Paul Bierley. Westerville OH: Integrity Press, 1991. vol. 2, pp. 655-656&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1968 song [[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]] by Scottish singer [[Donovan]] described Atlantis and its hypothetical fate. It charted in several countries, reaching #1 in Switzerland in 1969 and as high as #7 in the United States.

===Painting and sculpture===
Paintings of the submersion of Atlantis are comparatively rare. In the seventeenth century there was [[François de Nomé]]’s “The Fall of Atlantis”, which shows a tidal wave surging toward a Baroque city frontage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Atlantis_Monsu_Desiderio.jpg Wikimedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The style of architecture apart, it is not very different from [[Nicholas Roerich]]’s “The Last of Atlantis” of 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.wikinut.com/img/32jflhip_8dkz5sr/jpeg/0/Gibel-Atlantidy-by-Nicholas-Roerich.jpeg Wikinut]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most dramatic depiction of the catastrophe was [[Leon Bakst]]’s “Ancient Terror” (''Terror Antiquus'', 1908), although it does not name Atlantis directly. It is a mountain-top view of a rocky bay breached by the sea, which is washing inland about the tall structures of an ancient city. A streak of lightning crosses the upper half of the painting, while below it rises the impassive figure of an enigmatic goddess who holds a blue dove between her breasts. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] identified the subject as Atlantis in a public lecture on the painting given in 1909, the year it was first exhibited, and he has been followed by other commentators in the years since.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Davidson, “Cultural Memory and Survival”, London 2009, [discovery.ucl.ac.uk/69111/1/Cultural Memory FINAL REVISED VERSION.pdf pp.5-15]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptures referencing Atlantis have often been stylized single figures. One of the earliest was [[Einar Jónsson]]’s ''The King of Atlantis'' (1919–1922), now in the garden of his museum in [[Reykjavik]]. It represents a single figure, clad in a belted skirt and wearing a large triangular helmet, who sits on an ornate throne supported between two young bulls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2452/3695419751_47fc7eecd1_b.jpg Flicker]&lt;/ref&gt; The walking female entitled ''Atlantis'' (1946) by [[Ivan Meštrović]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://previews.123rf.com/images/shufu/shufu1212/shufu121200021/17025830-Atlantis-Ivan-Mestrovic-bronze-sculpture-1946-Stock-Photo.jpg View online]&lt;/ref&gt; was from a series inspired by ancient Greek figures &lt;ref&gt;Meštrović, Matthew, “Meštrović's American Experience”, [http://www.studiacroatica.org/jcs/24/2411.htm ''Journal of Croatian Studies'', XXIV, 1983]&lt;/ref&gt; with the symbolical meaning of unjustified suffering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weatherforecast.co.uk/europe/croatia/the-metrovi-gallery-17403.html Meštrović Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the [[Brussels]] fountain feature known as ''The Man of Atlantis'' (2003) by the Belgian sculptor {{Interlanguage link multi|Luk van Soom|nl|3=Luk van Soom}}, the  4-metre tall figure wearing a diving suit steps from a plinth into the spray.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brusselspictures.com/wp-content/photos/statues/de-man-van-atlantis.JPG Brussels Pictures]&lt;/ref&gt; It looks light-hearted but the artist’s comment on it makes a serious point: "Because habitable land will be scarce, it is no longer improbable that we will return to the water in the long term. As a result, a portion of the population will mutate into fish-like creatures. Global warming and rising water levels are practical problems for the world in general and here in the Netherlands in particular".&lt;ref&gt;Kunstbus article quoting [http://www.kunstbus.nl/kunst/luk+van+soom.html “Luk van Soom”]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Robert Smithson]]’s ''Hypothetical Continent (Map of broken clear glass, Atlantis)'' was first created as a photographical project on [[Loveladies, New Jersey|Loveladies Island NJ]] in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertsmithson.com/photoworks/hc_atlantis_300.htm Artist’s site]&lt;/ref&gt; and then recreated as a gallery installation of broken glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worleygig.com/2015/07/27/modern-art-monday-presents-robert-smithson-map-of-broken-glass-atlantis Dia Beacon Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; On this he commented that he liked “landscapes that suggest prehistory”, and this is borne out by the original conceptual drawing of the work that includes an inset map of the continent sited off the coast of Africa and at the straits into the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertsmithson.com/drawings/map_of_broken_glass_374.htm Artist’s site]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Anthony Brennan''' (born October 4, 1943) is an Irish-Canadian author and historian who specializes in books about the colourful personalities of Western Canada's past.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronicler feels affection for Alberta's larger-than-life folks," by Dana McNairn, [[Edmonton Journal]], Jan. 13, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Rogues, rebels and 'little surprises'," by Eric Volmers, [[Calgary Herald]], Oct. 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brian Brennan.jpg|thumb|Brennan in 2015]]
Born in [[Dublin]], Ireland, he migrated to Canada in 1966 and has lived in [[Calgary]], Alberta, since 1974. He spent 25 years as a staff writer with the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' writing columns and feature stories.&lt;ref&gt;"Critic-turned-author has led a charmed life," by Stephen Hunt, [[Calgary Herald]], Sept. 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Brennan was part of an attempt by the [[Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada]] to organize a union local for the newsroom and negotiate a first contract with the ''Calgary Herald''. Before and during the eight-month strike by journalists in 1999 and 2000, Brennan was a member of the union's bargaining committee.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://backofthebook.ca/2012/02/03/put-to-bed-the-strike-that-broke-the-news-at-the-calgary-herald/5801/ Put to bed: The strike that broke the news at the Calgary Herald."]&lt;/ref&gt; When the strike ended in June 2000 with the dissolution of the union, he left the Herald to devote himself full-time to writing books. He was the first winner of the Dave Greber Freelance Writers Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greberwritingaward.com|title=Dave Greber Freelance Writers Award, a Canadian writing contest with emphasis on social justice issues|website=www.greberwritingaward.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented in 2004 for his book ''Romancing the Rockies''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greberwritingaward.com/links.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A longtime National Council member of [[The Writers' Union of Canada]], he quit the union in 2018 when the union executive supported a decision by the editor of the union magazine to kill a story about a writers' conference in [[San Miguel de Allende]] Mexico&lt;ref&gt;http://www.factsandopinions.com/galleries/art/san-miguel-de-allende-nafta-of-literary-festivals/&lt;/ref&gt; that she had commissioned Brennan to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brianbrennan.ca/why-im-leaving-the-writers-union-of-canada/|title=Why I'm leaving The Writers' Union of Canada|date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chiapas conflict''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Conflicto de Chiapas'') refers to the '''[[Zapatista uprising|1994 Zapatista Uprising]]''' and its aftermath,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sipaz.org/crono/proceng.htm |title=sipaz.org/crono/proceng.htm |publisher=Sipaz.org |date=1994-01-01 |accessdate=2013-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081719/http://www.sipaz.org/crono/proceng.htm |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tensions between the [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous peoples]] and [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]] in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Chiapas]] from the 1990s to the present day.

The [[Zapatista uprising]] started in January 1994, and lasted less than two weeks before a ceasefire was agreed upon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~miturria/project/zapatista_timeline.html|title=Zapatista Timeline 1994|website=web.eecs.utk.edu|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal belligerents of subsection of the conflict were the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Spanish: ''Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional;'' ELZN) and the government of Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Negotiations between the government and Zapatistas led to agreements being signed, but were often not complied with in the following years as the [[Peacebuilding|peace process]] stagnated. This resulted in an increasing division between communities with ties to the government and communities that sympathized with the Zapatistas. Social tensions, armed conflict and [[para-military]] incidents increased, culminating in the [[Acteal massacre|killing of 45 people]] in the village of [[Acteal]] in 1997 by an anti-zapatista militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/world/americas/23acteal.html|title=10 Years Later, Chiapas Massacre Still Haunts Mexico|last=Lacey|first=Marc|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though at a low level, rebel activity continues and violence occasionally erupts between Zapatista supporters and anti-Zapatista militias along with the government. The last related incident occurred in 2014, when a Zapatista-affiliated teacher was killed and 15 more wounded in Chiapas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://schoolsforchiapas.org/zapatista-teacher-dead/|title=Zapatista teacher dead, 15 seriously wounded in deadly Chiapas ambush|date=2014-05-07|work=Schools for Chiapas|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Mexico kept many features of its Spanish colonizers, including [[limpieza de sangre]] or "cleanliness of blood," a legal code that distinguished those of non-Christian ancestries from those of Christian ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/180989420|title=Genealogical fictions : limpieza de sangre, religion, and gender in colonial Mexico|last=1966-2014.|first=Martínez, María Elena,|isbn=9780804756488|location=Stanford, California|oclc=180989420}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the starting point for many [[Land rights#Indigenous land rights|land rights]] and [[social rights]] struggles in Mexico, some of which can be attributed to the strict structure of Mexican social classes with the [[Criollo people]] at the top, who were Mexicans of direct Spanish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27725525|title=The contemporary history of Latin America|last=Tulio.|first=Halperín Donghi,|date=1993|publisher=Duke University Press|others=Chasteen, John Charles, 1955-|isbn=082231374X|location=Durham|oclc=27725525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary Mexico ===
The same issue appeared amongst the non-Criollo population in later years, especially among the [[Mestizo]] population during the 19th century. In the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910, poor farmers and other marginalized groups, led in part by [[Emiliano Zapata]], rebelled against the government and large land tenants due to failures of the authoritarian regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Insurrection to Revolution: Social Bases of Agrarian Violence|last=Tutino|first=John|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is from Zapata that the Zapatistas got their name.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zapatista-National-Liberation-Army|title=Zapatista National Liberation Army {{!}} political movement, Mexico|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Democratic Mexico ===
The years after the revolution saw several agrarian reforms, and through Article 27 of the [[Mexican Constitution]] the [[encomienda system]] was abolished and the right to [[communal land]] and other resources for the people of Mexico was granted in accordance with the principles set forth by Zapata.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=James J.|date=1994|title=Article 27 and Mexican Land Reform: The Legacy of Zapata's Dream|url=https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1693&amp;context=law_faculty_scholarship|journal=Columbia Human Rights Law Review|volume=25|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the Constitution more specifically gave the traditionally communal indigenous groups within the country the "legal capacity to enjoy common possession of the lands, forests, and waters belonging to them or which have been or may be restored to them."&lt;ref&gt;''Mexican Const.'' Art. 27 &lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[ejido]] system was created, which organized lands that were able to be worked by various members of rural and indigenous communities, but were often sold off to multinational corporations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The compromise recognized the right of individuals to own private property and of associations, whether Indian or other, to similarly own property, thereby allowing for security, safety, and property of the mostly Spanish upper class whilst elevating Indian and Meztizo groups to equality before the law while simultaneously allowing them to retain their traditional pre-colonial and colonial customs and rights.

However, since the issues of material and political equality were more complex than simple [[Marxism|Marxist]] land class problems, rather than instantly bringing about an increase in material wealth and standard of living, the living conditions of most of the country remained as before.

This was especially true in the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán peninsula]] where stubborn resistance of the [[Mayan peoples|Mayan]] population along with complex historical development features, kept the geographical area divided between an almost wholly European property owning and wage earning population living along the coasts and certain inland areas and the interior which in essence remained a Mayan country of collective ownership.  Consequently, removed from the overall Mexican economic system, the native Mayan Indian nation remained as a free but marginalized underclass much the same as before the revolution.

===1950s–60s Mexico ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
The hardened division of class and race remained in the Yucatán until the 1950s when the Mexican government began to use economic policy to better integrate indigenous Mayans into Mexican society. Perceiving the lack of sufficient jobs in the city and desirous of not upsetting the Mexican communities in the cities, the government encouraged and steered many landless farmers, mainly [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] Indians, into settling in the uncultivated [[Lacandon Jungle]] and the abandoned white farms which had suffered an enduring economic depression of the previous twenty years. However, although this kept a social crisis from occurring in the cities, it enraged many displaced Mexican farmers, especially of Criollo class, whose rights to land and title were supposedly being ignored in contravention of the compromise of the Mexican revolution.  Thus, during the 1950s and 1960s, this immigration of Mayans into former white lands led to land-related conflicts and an increasing pressure on the [[rain forest]] which in turn led to environmental degradation and further economic ruin of the rural economy.  Furthermore, rather than bring individual Mayan families into the practice of private property and the larger [[Economy of Mexico|Mexican economy]], the process backfired as much of the surplus Mayan community moved from its traditional areas into the new lands.

===1970s Mexico ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
As the crisis threatened to grow into rebellion by the mostly European population, and realizing that the ecological ruin caused by the movement wasn't being mitigated by economic prosperity within the Mayan population, the government decided to halt the migration.

To halt the migration, the government decided in 1971 to declare a large part of the forest (614,000 hectares, or 6140 km2), encompassing both the previously unsettled regions and the former Mexican-owned farms, as a protected area: the "Montes Azules Bio-sphere Reserve". They appointed only one small population group (66 [[Lacandon people|Lacandon]] Indian families) as tenants (thus creating the [[Lacandon Community]]), thereby displacing 2000 [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] and [[Ch'ol people|Chol]] families from 26 communities, and leaving non-Lacandon communities dependent on the government for asserting their rights to land.

===1980s–90s Mexico ===
Since the 1980s and 1990s, Mexico's economic policy concentrated more on industrial development and attracting foreign capital. However, this policy soon changed to try to brand Mexico as more of an agricultural power, which culminated in the administration of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] initiating a process of privatization of land through several amendments in 1992, which put the process of determining communal land under federal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge A. Vargas, ''Mexico's Legal Revolution: An Appraisal of Its Recent Constitutional Changes, 1988-1995'', 25 Ga. J. Int’l &amp; Comp. L. 497 (1996). &lt;/ref&gt; The EZLN claims that it has existed since 1983, although it only began to gain traction by the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Founding ===
In 1982, General [[Absalón Castellanos Domínguez|Absalon Castellanos Dominguez]], then [[Governor of Chiapas]], increased acts of violent oppression against indigenous people. Members of the National Liberation Forces (FLN), including Rafael Vicente, eventually known as [[Subcomandante Marcos]]—the eventual face and principal spokesman of the EZLN&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/243829617|title=Mexico : an encyclopedia of contemporary culture and history|last=1943-|first=Coerver, Don M.,|others=Pasztor, Suzanne B., 1964-, Buffington, Robert, 1952-|isbn=1851095179|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|oclc=243829617}}&lt;/ref&gt;—moved into the area later that year, and by late 1983 the EZLN was formed by 3 indigenous people and 3 mestizos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://schoolsforchiapas.org/teach-chiapas/zapatista-timeline/|title=Zapatista Timeline|date=2014-06-19|work=Schools for Chiapas|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the group grew, it became more like the state state of Chiapas, consisting primarily of indigenous or partly indigenous people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

=== The First Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle (1993) ===
In December 1993, The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) issued the First Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle, which declared that the government of Mexico and President Gortari were illegitimate. This declaration was heavily rooted in [[Emiliano Zapata|Emeliano Zapata]]'s [[Plan of Ayala]] (1911), which denounced President [[Francisco I. Madero|Francisco Madero]] and proposed several measures to reform the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zapataproject.org/content/first-declaration-lacandon-jungle-and-plan-ayala-laying-out-movement#_ftn12|title=The First Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle and the Plan of Ayala: Laying out a Movement {{!}} Zapata Project|website=zapataproject.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1994 uprising===
{{Main|Zapatista uprising}}
On 1 January 1994, the EZLN began their military insurrection in the southernmost province of Mexico, Chiapas, in the name of the rights of oppressed indigenous peoples and democracy; this was the same date on which the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) took effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stahler-Sholk|first=Richard|date=2010|title=The Zapatista Social Movement: Innovation and Sustainability|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41319261|journal=Alternatives: Global, Local, Political|volume=35|issue=3|pages=269–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EZLN based their operations out of the Lacandon Jungle, and used this as their launching point for capturing the towns of [[Ocosingo]], [[Las Margaritas, Chiapas|Las Margaritas]], [[Altamirano, Chiapas|Altamirano]], and [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 2 January, the rebels had already captured former Governor Castellanos Dominguez, and proceeded hold him hostage due to their own tribunal finding him guilty of anti-indigenous crimes and corruption, and sentenced him to forced labor.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/17/world/mexican-negotiator-meets-rebels-as-former-governor-is-released.html?rref=collection/timestopic/Zapatista%20National%20Liberation%20Army|title=Mexican Negotiator Meets Rebels As Former Governor Is Released|last=Depalma|first=Anthony|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 3 January, the EZLN had lost over 50 of its soldiers, and over 100 civilians had been killed, but had withdrawn from San Cristóbal de las Casas, as they could not maintain their grip on it; they had also liberated a government prison with about 180 inmates.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/01/04/bloody-indian-revolt-continues-in-mexico/d7b128b7-4d84-45e7-bfde-902c632f684c/|title=BLOODY INDIAN REVOLT CONTINUES IN MEXICO|date=1994-01-04|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the period of 1-12 January 1994, there was a large discretion between the information released and spread by the two respective sides. The government insisted that there were only a few hundred rebels, while the EZLN reported that they numbered in the thousands. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Initial peace negotiations ====
The federal government reached a ceasefire agreement with the EZLN on 12 January,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and on 17 February the peace negotiators of each party met for the first time, resulting in the freeing of Castellanos Dominguez. [[Manuel Camacho Solís|Manuel Camacho Solis]] was the government's chief peace negotiator,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Subcomandante Marcos was the EZLN's, and Bishop [[Samuel Ruiz|Samuel Ruiz Garcia]] mediated between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/world/peace-discussions-start-in-mexico.html?rref=collection/timestopic/Zapatista%20National%20Liberation%20Army|title=PEACE DISCUSSIONS START IN MEXICO|last=Golden|first=Tim|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As peace talks continued, there were several high and low points in apparent progress in drafting an agreement, but eventually there was a shift in strategy on the part of the rebels to keep up the talks until the upcoming [[Mexican general election, 1994|Mexican Election]], to increase the pressure on the government after years of having little to no way to influence government policy or actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/world/rebel-leader-says-zapatistas-won-t-disarm-yet.html?rref=collection/timestopic/Zapatista%20National%20Liberation%20Army|title=Rebel Leader Says Zapatistas Won't Disarm Yet|last=Golden|first=Tim|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 June, the EZLN rejected the agreement proposed by the Mexican government, but reinforced its commitment to the ceasefire unless the government broke it first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/13/world/rebels-in-mexico-spurn-peace-plan-from-government.html?rref=collection/timestopic/Zapatista%20National%20Liberation%20Army|title=REBELS IN MEXICO SPURN PEACE PLAN FROM GOVERNMENT|last=Golden|first=Tim|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-October, tensions began escalating when the rebels threatened action if the Governor-Elect [[Eduardo Robledo Rincon]] of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) were to take office. Subcomandante Marcos also heightened the rhetoric in this situation: "If they want lead, we'll give them lead... We are an army, not a labor union or some neighborhood club."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/18/world/insurgents-in-mexico-threaten-to-fight-if-governor-is-installed.html?rref=collection/timestopic/Zapatista%20National%20Liberation%20Army|title=Insurgents in Mexico Threaten to Fight if Governor Is Installed|last=Golden|first=Tim|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

===After the uprising (1995–1997)===

====Media attention====
These developments attracted a lot of international attention and criticism. While human rights organizations emphasized the [[marginalization]] of the indigenous population, [[Riordan Roett]] (adviser to the [[Emerging Markets]] Group of the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]]) stated in January 1995:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"While Chiapas, in our opinion, does not pose a fundamental threat to Mexican political stability, it is perceived to be so by many in the investment community. The government will need to eliminate the Zapatistas to demonstrate their effective control of the national territory and of security policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/46/025.html |title=Brad Parsons, Mexico: US Bank Orders Hit on Marcos |publisher=Hartford-hwp.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just 2 days later the Mexican army came into action to bring the Zapatista occupied areas back under their control, but they did not succeed in arresting [[subcomandante Marcos]] or other leaders of the EZLN.

====Peace negotiations====
In February 1995, the new President, [[Ernesto Zedillo]], attacked the EZLN once again, which proved to be politically unpopular, resulting in new peace negotiations that culminated in the [[San Andrés Accords]] of 1996.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This treaty indicated an agreement on the importance of indigenous autonomy and land reform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In 1996, the [[Comisión de Concordia y Pacificación]] (COCOPA) presented a proposal of constitutional reform (the [[Cocopa law]]) based on the San Andrés Accords to the EZLN and the federal government. As a gesture of political will to solve the conflict peacefully the [[Zedillo]] government signed this proposal, thereby recognizing the indigenous culture and its right to land and autonomy (in concordance with [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|International Labour Organization convention 169]], signed by Mexico in 1990).

On 21 March, 1999, several [[Mexican referendums, 1999|referendums]] on the rights of indigenous people were held with support of the EZLN, and the people voted in support of the San Andrés Accords, although turnout was low compared to general elections in that time period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

===Acteal Massacre (1997)===
In the months leading up to the [[Acteal massacre|Acteal Massacre]], growing violence resulted in over 6000 people being displaced, and 25 had been killed in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/25/world/in-mexican-village-signs-of-death-hang-heavy.html|title=In Mexican Village, Signs of Death Hang Heavy|last=Fisher|first=Ian|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 1997, this culminated in the largest incident of violence of the Chiapas Conflict since the initial rebellion took place in the village of [[Acteal]], in which 45 indigenous people, 15 of whom were children, were murdered by people with machetes and AK-47 assault rifles inside a church.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/25/opinion/death-in-chiapas.html|title=Death in Chiapas|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the killing, the investigation was led by Attorney General [[Jorge Madrazo Cuéllar|Jorge Madrazo Cuellar]], and the witnesses/survivors of the Acteal Massacre have said that the attackers were loyalists to the governing PRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/27/world/mexico-charges-16-in-killing-of-45-villagers.html|title=Mexico Charges 16 in Killing of 45 Villagers|last=Fisher|first=Ian|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the month, several people had been charged with the killings, including the de facto mayor of Acteal, [[Jacinto Arias Cruz]], a member of the PRI, resulting in the national party denying any connection to the killings and to the mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/29/world/governing-party-mexico-denies-any-role-massacre-45-indians-last-week.html|title=Governing Party in Mexico Denies Any Role in the Massacre of 45 Indians Last Week|last=Fisher|first=Ian|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===PRI power downfall (2000–2001)===
On 2 July, 2000, the first non-PRI president was [[Mexican general election, 2000|elected]], [[Vicente Fox]], ending the PRI's 71 year grip on the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB962620220470638063|title=Vicente Fox Wins Election, Ending PRI's Grip on Mexican Presidency|last=Roundup|first=A WSJ.com News|work=WSJ|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign focused on increasing economic growth and ending government corruption.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vicente-Fox|title=Vicente Fox {{!}} Biography, Presidency, &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== March on the capital (March 2001) ====
[[File:Sub Marcos.jpg|thumb|Subcomandante Marcos at the March of the Color of the Earth.]]
In March 2001, about 100,000 supporters of the Zapatistas and the rights of indigenous people mobilized in [[Mexico City]] to express their demands of the government; many of the rebels, lead by Subcomandante Marcos, traveled for two weeks to reach the cite of the political rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/12/world/zapatista-rebels-rally-in-mexico-city.html|title=Zapatista Rebels Rally in Mexico City|last=Weiner|first=Ginger Thompson and Tim|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This march was known as the "March of the Color of the Earth" (Spanish: ''La Marcha del Color de la Tierra'') after a quote by Marcos.&lt;ref&gt;Chihu Amparán, A. (2002). La marcha del color de la Tierra. Araucaria. Revista Iberoamericana de Filosofía, Política y Humanidades, 4 (8), 63-79.&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapatistas expressed support for a Bill of Rights for the nation's minority Indian population and, in his speech to the crowds, Marcos demanded that President Fox "listen to us," despite Fox's vocal support for, and initial proposal of&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;, the Zapatista-backed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1326248/100000-welcome-Zapatista-march-on-capital.html|title=100,000 welcome Zapatista march on capital|last=Buchanan|first=Ronald|date=2001-03-13|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of April 2001, the Bill was passed by Congress by a wide margin, with Fox's support, but underwent several amendments before it was passed that was criticized by a number of indigenous leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/30/world/mexico-congress-approves-altered-rights-bill.html|title=Mexico Congress Approves Altered Rights Bill|last=Thompson|first=Ginger|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapatistas referred to the final version of the law as a "betrayal" because of its failure to affirm the communal rights indigenous people had to land, other natural resources, and to have autonomous states within Mexico, contrary to the San Andrés Accords.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  

===EZLN dialogue suspended (2003)===
In response to the passage of the law with its new amendments, the ELZN suspended dialogue with the government and created a new system of leadership, which was necessary to govern autonomously as the San Andrés Accords allowed, in principle, and created "Good Government Committees (JBG)" to do so.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

===Latest developments===
The peace process has been in a gridlock ever since, the government officially ignores the EZLN, seeing it just as a political rival, but armed attacks involving pro-government [[para-military]] groups frequently make civilian casualties. (see the [[Chiapas conflict#List of violent incidents and intimidation in the Lacandon region (1995–2008)|list]] below).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The last violent incident occurred in 2014, with a Zapatista-related teacher killed and 15 more wounded in Chiapas ambush by alleged anti-Zapatista militia; however, there appears to be some dispute as to whether the casualties occurred due to a "confrontation" or an "ambush of unarmed" civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://schoolsforchiapas.org/zapatista-teacher-dead/|title=Zapatista teacher dead, 15 seriously wounded in deadly Chiapas ambush|date=2014-05-07|work=Schools for Chiapas|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Social development policies==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Although and because the [[Chiapas]] conflict is intricately linked with [[low intensity conflict]] and [[fourth generation warfare]], it is important to stress that the conflict is not only about military or para-military action against armed rebels. Addressing the problems in the region with [[social development]] programs are often interpreted by the [[target group]] as "[[counter-insurgency]] light"; as a means to [[divide and rule]].

Since the creation of the [[Lacandon Community#Social history (20th century)|Lacandon Community]] (1971) and the growing tensions in the region, and even more so since the Zapatista uprising (1994), the government has been faced by three challenges:
# preservation of the [[rainforest]] in the Lacandon region
# combatting poverty &amp; stimulating citizenship among the communities in the Lacandon region
# control over the socio-political situation in the Lacandon region

These goals have been included in several [[social development]] programs. Examples are ''Programa Solidaridad'', ''Plan Cañadas'', ''PIDSS'', and [[Prodesis]].

===Plan Cañadas===
''Plan Cañadas'' (1994–2001) ([[wikt:cañada|cañada]] = glen or valley) was conceived after they found [[guerrilla]] training camps in the [[Lacandon Jungle]] in 1993 (just before the [[Zapatista uprising]]). This programme was aimed at suppressing the expected uprising by social means, by giving support to people who were more favourably disposed to the government, and thus ensuring their loyalty to the state. Over time ''Plan Cañadas'' was criticised for being a [[counter-insurgency]] project ("counter-insurgency-by-other-means", or "counter-insurgency light") designed in the framework of the [[low intensity conflict]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It was in the aftermath of the rebellion that the Mexican government began to devote resources to the region for development, establishing the Cañadas Programme. However, a few years after the initiative was introduced it became highly criticised because of its counter-insurgent character (it offered resources in exchange for the abandonment of the Zapatista cause) and because of its failure in promoting development."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drc-citizenship.org/docs/internships/2002/OM_mexico.pdf Oriol Mirosa-Canal: Evaluation of the Integral Programme for the Sustainable Development of the Lacandon Jungle (PIDSS)],{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Mexico 2002; Internship report for the DRC on Citizenship, Participation and Accountability
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===PIDSS===
''Plan Cañada'''s successor was the ''Integral Programme for the Sustainable Development of the Jungle'': ''PIDSS''  (Programa Integral para el Desarrollo Sustentable de la Selva). This project, that started in 2001, was introduced as "a joint effort to foster development in a participatory way". Goals were to change the relationship between government and society, foster social reconciliation, exclude paternalism, promote participation, and endorse real development projects. The implementation of the programme was achieved through the creation of 34 micro-regions (similar to those under which the ''Cañadas Programme'' worked). However, ''PIDSS'' received much of the same criticism as ''Plan Cañadas'':

{{quote|The outcomes of the Programme fall short of those expected. The '''types of projects that appear in the development plans are the same as those promoted during the Cañadas Programme'''. [...] Villagers in the region display much disillusionment and discontent. In fact, in most of the interviews it was affirmed that the present programme was worse than its predecessor. [...] The situation suggests that the authorities did not take properly into account the difficulties that the new initiative would encounter and which are the source of its problems. [...] A very important source of conflict has come from the '''groups that benefited most from the Cañadas Programme. These groups have fought very hard to keep their privileges and to return to the previous model,''' [...] '''which has distorted the operation of the programme and led to further conflict'''. [...] Moreover, the '''presence of [[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities|Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities]] in the region, which do not desire any relationship with the Mexican government and thus do not participate in the PIDSS, complicates things even further'''. Disputes over land are very common, and the presence of paramilitary forces confronting the Zapatistas makes the situation even more difficult.

There is a lack of coordination between different government institutions, and even some divergence of objectives. The state government, for instance, seems to perceive '''hidden interests among the officials of the federal government for the PIDSS to fail'''. [...] The technicians of the federal government seem to be much better prepared than the others, which allows them to dominate and impose their decisions. [...] The technicians seem to have a disproportionate amount of discretionary power. This is dangerous if we take into account that the main problems of the Cañadas Programme came through the behaviour of some of the federal government technicians. And in fact our research has shown that in some communities '''complaints about the counter-insurgency behaviour of the technicians have began to appear'''.

Another source of problems for the PIDSS seems to lie in the '''notions of participation and development''' pursued and those of the different actors. From the very beginning there was a general agreement that the Programme had to be participative and foster development. However, no effort was made to reach an agreement on what these concepts mean and entail. The result is that, for instance, the '''PIDSS has sought participation of the population in a very limited way'''.

In the interviews with the social organisations it was also argued that their problems to participate were due to the fact that they defend '''a notion of development that is opposed to that of the government'''. They argue that the PIDSS is an element that has to be related with the wider ''Puebla-Panama Plan'', which is a regional development plan based on the implantation of low-wage factories (maquiladoras) and similar liberal economic initiatives. In opposition to this, people in the '''communities talk about the importance of land and about maintaining their way of life'''. Again, these elements are not taken into account in the design and operation of the Programme, and as a consequence have a negative impact in its outcomes.

'''Conclusions''':
# The permanent conflict in the area and past development initiatives are important determinants that should have been better taken into account and incorporated in the design of the program.
# Issues regarding coordination among different levels of the administration have proved to be a source of problems. These appear at the level of objectives, but also in the day-to-day operation, with the important role of the technicians and their discretionary power as a key issue.
# The underlying notions of development and participation certainly determine the nature of the initiative and people's expectations of it, and thus have to be dealt with from the beginning. Promoting participation but then to have it managed through questionnaires in which people have no input and which are filled in by secondary school students implies an understanding of the concept that is, at the very least, problematic.[http://www.drc-citizenship.org/docs/internships/2002/OM_mexico.pdf]}}

===Prodesis===
The follow-up of ''PIDSS'' was [[Prodesis]] (2004–2008), an EU-Chiapas cooperation project targeted at 16 of the 34 micro-regions identified by ''PIDSS''.
The difficulties this new project encountered were exactly the same as the PIDSS-project stumbled upon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* It was argued that "Prodesis sought participation of the population in a very limited way".
* Also there were accounts of "counter-insurgency behaviour of the technicians".
* Moreover, the fact that Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities do not desire any relationship with the Mexican government prevents full participation of the whole target group, leading to "further conflict between and within communities".
* Finally, it was argued, Prodesis interpreted the problems in the region along demographic lines, "ignoring the cultural and socio-political history of the region" (i.e., the fact that a large part of the population defends a notion of development that is opposed to that of the government, and stresses the importance of land and maintaining their way of life).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Criticism===
All of these projects ''(Cañadas, PIDSS, Prodesis)'' have been criticized for being actually [[counter-insurgency]] projects, aimed at controlling and pacifying the population, rather than improving their living conditions and resolving the conflict by addressing the land issue. Because of scepticism among the target groups of these programs (for lack of consultation, transparency and democracy, by being [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] and counter-insurgent, and having no respect for the population or local organizations) many projects fail. Therefore, a future challenge for the government (federal or state) is to:
* preserve the [[Lacandon Jungle|rainforest]], as well as to
* improve the social conditions of the [[Maya peoples#Chiapas|population]], but
* without being suspected of [[counter-insurgency]] and [[low intensity warfare]].

==List of violent incidents (1994–present)==
Total casualties during the conflict: 105 killed.

It denounces that in these times there were in the state a number of cases of grave torture, dozens of attempts on the lives of Human Rights Defenders; and against civil organizations and social leaders; and hundreds of military and police actions in the conflict zone.
*'''First two weeks of June 1999''': Significant increase in military and police incursions in Zapatista communities; arbitrary detentions of presumed Zapatistas; harassment by military personnel at the military bases; and concentration of troops. Each of the incursions involves the participation of between 100 and 1000 military and police personnel.

==Media influence==
While the Zapatistas have little physical effect outside of Chiapas, their domination of the "information space" has strengthened their image and allies from foreign activists and journalists.&lt;ref name="ronfeldt" /&gt; Because the members of EZLN are residents of Chiapas, living in the jungle, original material for the organization started out as written communiques for media outlets, which were then uploaded to the Internet. Many forums and websites dedicated to the discussion of the Chiapas conflict are sponsored by advocacy groups centered on Latin America and indigenous protection, mostly situated in North America and Western Europe.&lt;ref name="libcom"&gt;[https://libcom.org/library/zapatista-effect-cleaver libcom.org], The Zapatista Effect: The Internet and the rise of an alternative political fabric.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the uprising, fax campaigns and public caravans were popular methods of gaining media attention and organizing supporters.&lt;ref name=ronfeldt&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ronfeldt|first1=David|title=The Zapatista "Social Netwar" in Mexico.|date=1999|publisher=RAND Corp.|location=Santa Monica|isbn=9780833043320|pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Quix''' (8 October 1773, [[Hoensbroek]], [[Heerlen]] – 13 January 1844, [[Aachen]]) was a Roman Catholic priest, [[heimatforscher]] and from 1833 the director of the Stadtbibliothek Aachen, the city library of Aachen.

==Life==
The son of a typical tenant farming family from the Dutch province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], after his [[abitur]] he pursued a theological career. He entered the [[Carmelite]] order in 1792 and was ordained priest in 1795. However, the abolition of the monasteries in the French department of [[Roer (department)|Roer]] cut his employment prospects and he left the order to work as a private tutor. From 1806 until early retirement due to deafness in 1823 he was appointed to what is now the Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium in Aachen, teaching ancient languages, history and natural history and developing his own knowledge of these topics. After 1823 he devoted himself to research on local history, gathering documents and archival materials from various monasteries and offices, evaluating them and writing works on them.

In early philosophies of [[psychology]] and [[metaphysics]], '''conatus''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|ˈ|n|eɪ|t|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=conatus&amp;nbsp;— Definitions from Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conatus|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] for "effort; endeavor; impulse, inclination, tendency; undertaking; striving") is an innate inclination of a thing to continue to exist and enhance itself.&lt;ref name="Traup"&gt;{{Harvnb|Traupman|1966|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "thing" may be [[mind]], [[matter]], or a combination of both. Over the millennia, many different definitions and treatments have been formulated. Seventeenth-century philosophers [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]] made important contributions.&lt;ref Name="LeB"&gt;{{Harvnb|LeBuffe|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--These last three constitute the "great early modern classic[s] of ''conatus''" {{Harv|Tuusvuori|2000|p=147}}.--&gt; The ''conatus'' may refer to the instinctive "will to live" of living organisms or to various metaphysical theories of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and [[inertia]].&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the concept is associated with [[God]]'s will in a [[pantheist]] view of [[Nature]].&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shop"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schopenhauer|1958|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept may be broken up into separate definitions for the mind and body and split when discussing [[centrifugal force]] and inertia.&lt;ref name="Koll"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kollerstrom|1999|pp=331–356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the term ''conatus'' is that of a series of subtle tweaks in meaning and clarifications of scope developed over the course of two and a half millennia. Successive philosophers to adopt the term put their own personal twist on the concept, each developing the term differently such that it now has no accepted definition.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt; The earliest authors to discuss ''conatus'' wrote primarily in Latin, basing their usage on [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concepts. These thinkers therefore used "''conatus''" not only as a technical term but as a common word and in a general sense. In archaic texts, the more technical usage is difficult to discern from the more common one, and they are also hard to differentiate in translation. In [[English (language)|English]] translations, the term is italicized when used in the technical sense or translated and followed by ''conatus'' in brackets.&lt;ref name="Leib89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leibniz|1989|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ''conatus'' is rarely used in the technical sense, since modern physics uses concepts such as [[inertia]] and [[conservation of momentum]] that have superseded it. It has, however, been a notable influence on nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]].

==Classical origins==
[[Image:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
The Latin ''[[wikt:conatus|cōnātus]]'' comes from the verb ''[[wikt:conor|cōnor]]'', which is usually translated into English as, "to endeavor"; but the concept of the ''conatus'' was first developed by the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] (333–264 BCE) and [[Peripatetics]] (c. 335 BCE) before the [[Common Era]]. These groups used the word {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὁρμή|ὁρμή]]}} (''hormê'', translated in Latin by ''[[Theory of impetus|impetus]]'') to describe the movement of the soul towards an object, and from which a physical act results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], in SVF, III, 377; [[Cicero]], ''[[De Officiis]]'', I, 132; [[Seneca the Younger]], ''[[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium]]'', 113, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Classical thinkers, [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (106–43 BCE) and [[Diogenes Laertius]] (c. 235 BCE), expanded this principle to include an aversion to destruction, but continued to limit its application to the motivations of non-human animals. Diogenes Laertius, for example, specifically denied the application of the term to plants. Before the [[Renaissance]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225–1274 CE), [[Duns Scotus]] (c. 1266–1308 CE) and [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321 CE) expressed similar sentiments using the Latin words ''vult'', ''velle'' or ''appetit'' as synonyms of ''conatus''; indeed, all four terms may be used to translate the original Greek {{lang|grc|ὁρμή}}. Later&lt;!--Did Wolfson give exact date? I wrote down 1700, originally, but that is impossible.--&gt;, [[Telesius]] and [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]] extended the ancient Greek notions and applied them to all objects, animate and inanimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Wolfson|1934|pp=196,199,202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First [[Aristotle]], then Cicero and Laertius each alluded to a connection between the ''conatus'' and other emotions. In their view, the former induces the latter. They maintained that humans do not wish to do something because they think it "good", but rather they think it "good" because they want to do it. In other words, the cause of human desire is the natural inclination of a body to augment itself in accordance with the principles of the ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval views==
{{Further|Theory of impetus}}
{{See also|Physics in medieval Islam|Scholasticism|Medieval philosophy}}
There is a traditional connection between ''conatus'' and motion itself. Aquinas and [[Judah Leon Abravanel|Abravanel]] (1265–1321) both related the concept directly to that which [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430 CE) saw to be the "natural movements upward and downward or with their being balanced in an intermediate position" described in his ''[[De Civitate Dei]]'', (c. 520 CE). They called this force that causes objects to rise or fall, "''amor naturalis''", or "natural love".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|pp=197,200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century, [[John Philoponus]] (c. 490–c. 570 CE) criticized Aristotle's view of motion, noting the inconsistency between Aristotle's discussion of projectiles, where the medium of [[aether (classical element)|aether]] keeps projectiles going, and his discussion of the void, where there is no such medium and hence a body's motion should be impossible. Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of some surrounding medium but by some property, or ''conatus'' implanted in the object when it was set in motion. This was not the modern concept of inertia, for there was still the need for an inherent power to keep a body in motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|1988|pp=227,228}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was strongly opposed by [[Averroës]] and many [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers who supported Aristotle.&lt;ref name="Leaman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leaman|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aristotelian view was also challenged in the Islamic world. For example, [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) seems to have supported Philoponus' views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sabra|1994|pp=133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he developed a concept similar to [[inertia]].&lt;ref name=salam&gt;{{Harvnb|Salam|1987|pp=179–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of inertia was developed more clearly in the work of his contemporary [[Avicenna]], who conceived a permanent force whose effect is dissipated only as a result of external agents such as [[air resistance]], making him "the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sayili|1987|p=477}}:
{{quote|"It was a permanent force whose effect got dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance. He is apparently the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna's concept of ''mayl'' is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion and is reminiscent of [[Newton's first law of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sayili|1987|p=477}}: {{quote|"Indeed, self-motion of the type conceived by Ibn Sina is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion of the projectile type, and it is rather reminiscent of the principle of inertia, i.e., Newton's first law of motion."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna also developed an idea similar to [[momentum]], when he attempted to provide a quantitative relation between the [[weight]] and [[velocity]] of a moving body.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia|author=[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] &amp; Mehdi Amin Razavi|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=0-7007-0314-4|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Buridan]] (1300–1358) also rejected the notion that this motion-generating property, which he named ''impetus'', dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by the resistance of the air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of [[momentum]]. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grant|1964|pp=265–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the seventeenth century, René Descartes (1596–1650) began to develop a more modern, [[materialism|materialistic]] concept of the ''conatus'', describing it as "an active power or tendency of bodies to move, expressing the power of God".&lt;ref name="Piet"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pietarinen|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the ancients used the term in a strictly [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] sense similar to voluntary "endeavoring" or "struggling" to achieve certain ends, and medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers developed a notion of ''conatus'' as a mysterious intrinsic property of things, Descartes uses the term in a somewhat more [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garber|1992|pp=150,154}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, for Descartes, in contrast to Buridan, movement and stasis are two states of the same thing, not different things. Although there is much ambiguity in Descartes' notion of ''conatus'', one can see here the beginnings of a move away from the attribution of desires and intentions to nature and its workings toward a more scientific and modern view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaukroger|1980|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes rejects the [[teleology|teleological]], or purposive, view of the material world that was dominant in the West from the time of Aristotle.&lt;!--Steve Nadler refutes the use of "despite" here--&gt; The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the whole thing in motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The ''conatus'' is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no ''new'' motion or rest can be created or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gueroult|1980|pp=120–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes specifies two varieties of the ''conatus'': ''conatus a centro'' and ''conatus recedendi''. ''Conatus a centro'', or "tendency towards the center", is used by Descartes as a theory of [[gravity]]; ''conatus recendendi'', or "tendency away from the center", represents the [[centrifugal force]]s.&lt;ref name="Koll" /&gt; These tendencies are not to be thought of in terms of animate dispositions and intentions, nor as inherent properties or "forces" of things, but rather as a unifying, external characteristic of the physical universe itself which God has bestowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garber|1992|pp=180,184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes, in developing his First Law of Nature, also invokes the idea of a ''conatus se movendi'', or "''conatus'' of self-preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is a generalization of the principle of [[inertia]], which was developed and experimentally demonstrated earlier by [[Galileo]]. The principle was formalized by [[Isaac Newton]] and made into the first of his three [[Laws of Motion]] fifty years after the death of Descartes. Descartes' version states: "Each thing, insofar as in it lies, always perseveres in the same state, and when once moved, always continues to move."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackwell|1966|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Conatus'' and the psyche===
Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), too, worked off of the previous notions of the ''conatus'' principle. However, he criticized the previous definitions for failing to explain the origin of motion. Working toward this end became the primary focus of Hobbes' work in this area. Indeed, Hobbes "reduces all the cognitive functions of the mind to variations of its ''conative'' functions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Hobbes describes [[emotion]] as the beginning of motion and the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] as the sum of all emotions. This "will" forms the ''conatus'' of a body&lt;ref name="Piet" /&gt; and its physical manifestation is the perceived "will to survive".&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; In order that living beings may thrive, Hobbes says, "they seek peace and fight anything that threatens this peace".&lt;ref name="Piet" /&gt; Hobbes also equates this ''conatus'' with "imagination", and states that a change in the ''conatus'', or will, is the result of "deliberation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmitter|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Conatus'' and physics===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I define [''conatus''] to be motion made in less space and time than can be given; that is, less than can be determined or assigned by exposition or number; that is, motion made through the length of a point, and in an instant or point of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobbes|1998|loc=III, xiv, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As in his psychological theory, Hobbes's physical ''conatus'' is an infinitesimal unit of motion. It is the ''beginning'' of motion: an inclination in a specified direction. The concept of ''[[Inertia#Theory of impetus|impetus]]'', as used by Hobbes, is defined in terms of this physical ''conatus''. It is "a measure of the ''conatus'' exercised by a moving body over the course of time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jesseph|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friction|Resistance]] is caused by a contrary ''conatus''; [[force]] is this motion plus "the magnitude of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jesseph|2006|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes also uses the word ''conatus'' to refer to the "restorative forces" which may cause [[Spring (device)|springs]], for example, to contract or expand. Hobbes claims there is some force inherent in these objects that inclines them to return to their previous state. Today, science attributes this phenomenon to material [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].&lt;ref name="Osler"&gt;{{Harvnb|Osler|2001|pp=157–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Spinoza==
{{See also|Baruch Spinoza}}
Conatus is a central theme in the philosophy of Benedict de Spinoza (1632–1677). According to Spinoza, "each thing, as far as it lies in itself, strives to persevere in its being" (''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', part 3, prop. 6). Spinoza presents a few reasons for believing this. First, particular things are, as he puts it, modes of God, which means that each one expresses the power of God in a particular way (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 6, dem.). Moreover, it could never be part of the definition of God that his modes contradict one another (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 5); each thing, therefore, "is opposed to everything which can take its existence away" (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 6, dem.). This resistance to destruction is formulated by Spinoza in terms of a striving to continue to exist, and ''conatus'' is the word he most often uses to describe this force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allison|1975|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedictus de Spinoza]]]]

Striving to persevere is not merely something that a thing does in addition to other activities it might happen to undertake. Rather, striving is "nothing but the actual essence of the thing" (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 7). Spinoza also uses the term ''conatus'' to refer to rudimentary concepts of [[inertia]], as Descartes had earlier.&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; Since a thing cannot be destroyed without the action of external forces, motion and rest, too, exist indefinitely until disturbed.&lt;ref name="All"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allison|1975|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral manifestation===
The concept of the ''conatus'', as used in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s [[psychology]], is derived from sources both ancient and medieval. Spinoza reformulates principles that [[the Stoics]], [[Cicero]], [[Laertius]], and especially Hobbes and Descartes developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|2006|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; One significant change he makes to Hobbes' theory is his belief that the ''conatus ad motum'', (''conatus'' to motion), is ''not'' mental, but material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza, with his [[determinism]], believes that man and nature must be unified under a consistent set of laws; [[God]] and [[nature]] are one, and there is no [[free will]]. Contrary to most philosophers of his time and in accordance with most of those of the present, Spinoza rejects the dualistic assumption that mind, [[intentionality]], ethics, and freedom are to be treated as things separate from the natural world of physical objects and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jarrett|1991|pp=470–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal is to provide a unified explanation of all these things within a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] framework, and his notion of ''conatus'' is central to this project. For example, an action is "free", for Spinoza, only if it arises from the essence and ''conatus'' of an entity. There can be no absolute, unconditioned freedom of the will, since all events in the natural world, including human actions and choices, are [[determinism|determined]] in accord with the natural laws of the universe, which are inescapable. However, an action can still be free in the sense that it is not constrained or otherwise subject to external forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lachterman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human beings are thus an integral part of nature.&lt;ref name="All" /&gt; Spinoza explains seemingly irregular human behaviour as really "natural" and rational and motivated by this principle of the ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutton|2006|loc= chp. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, he replaces the notion of free will with the ''conatus'', a principle that can be applied to all of nature and not just man.&lt;ref name="All" /&gt;

====Emotions and affects====
Spinoza's view of the relationship between the ''conatus'' and the human [[affect (psychology)|affects]] is not clear. [[Firmin DeBrabander]], assistant professor of philosophy at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], and [[Antonio Damasio]], professor of [[neuroscience]] at the [[University of Southern California]], both argue that the human affects arise from the ''conatus'' and the perpetual drive toward perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DeBrabander|2007|pp=20–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Spinoza states in his ''Ethics'' that happiness, specifically, "consists in the human capacity to preserve itself". This "endeavor" is also characterized by Spinoza as the "foundation of [[virtue]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a person is saddened by anything that opposes his ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|pp=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Bidney]] (1908–1987), professor at [[Yale University]], disagrees. Bidney closely associates "desire", a primary affect, with the ''conatus'' principle of Spinoza. This view is backed by the Scholium of IIIP9 of the ''Ethics'' which states, "Between appetite and desire there is no difference, except that desire is generally related to men insofar as they are conscious of the appetite. So desire can be defined as appetite together with consciousness of the appetite."&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; According to Bidney, this desire is controlled by the other affects, pleasure and pain, and thus the ''conatus'' strives towards that which causes joy and avoids that which produces pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=[''Conatus''] is to motion as a point is to space, or as one to infinity, for it is the beginning and end of motion.
|source= &lt;ref name="Art98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Arthur|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) was a student of [[Erhard Weigel]] (1625–1699) and learned of the ''conatus'' principle from him and from Hobbes, though Weigel used the word ''tendentia'' (Latin: tendency).&lt;ref name="Art98" /&gt; Specifically, Leibniz uses the word ''conatus'' in his ''Exposition and Defence of the New System'' (1695) to describe a notion similar that of Hobbes, but he differentiates between the ''conatus'' of the body and soul, the first of which may only travel in a straight line by its own power, and the latter of which may "remember" more complicated motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leibniz|1988|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Leibniz, the problem of motion comes to a resolution of the [[paradox of Zeno]].
Since motion is continuous, space must be infinitely divisible. In order for anything to begin moving at all, there must be some mind-like, voluntaristic property or force inherent in the basic constituents of the universe that propels them. This ''conatus'' is a sort of instantaneous or "virtual" motion that all things possess, even when they are static. Motion, meanwhile, is just the summation of all the ''conatuses'' that a thing has, along with the interactions of things. The ''conatus'' is to motion as a point is to space.&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gillespie|1971|pp=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this view is that an object that collides with another would not be able to bounce back, if the only force in play were the ''conatus''. Hence, Leibniz was forced to postulate the existence of an [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] that kept objects moving and allowed for elastic collisions. Leibniz' concept of a mind-like memory-less property of ''conatus'', coupled with his rejection of [[atom]]s, eventually led to his theory of [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]].&lt;ref name="Carl"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlin|2004|pp=365–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz also uses his concept of a ''conatus'' in developing the principles of the [[integral calculus]], adapting the meaning of the term, in this case, to signify a mathematical analog of Newton's accelerative "[[force]]". By summing an infinity of such ''conatuses'' (i.e., what is now called [[integral|integration]]), Leibniz could measure the effect of a continuous force.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; He defines ''[[Theory of impetus|impetus]]'' as the result of a continuous summation of the ''conatus'' of a body, just as the ''[[vis viva]]'' (or "living force") is the sum of the inactive ''[[vis mortua]]''.&lt;ref name="Duch"&gt;{{Harvnb|Duchesneau|1998|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the work of Kepler and probably Descartes, Leibniz develops a model of planetary motion based on the ''conatus'' principle, the idea of aether and a fluid [[vortex]]. This theory is expounded in the work ''Tentamen de motuum coelestium causis'' (1689).&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; According to Leibniz, Kepler's analysis of elliptical orbits into a circular and a radial component can be explained by a "harmonic vortex" for the circular motion combined with a centrifugal force and gravity, both of which are examples of ''conatus'', to account for the radial motion.&lt;ref name="Carl" /&gt; Leibniz later defines the term ''monadic conatus'', as the "state of change" through which his monads perpetually advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arthur|1994|loc=sec. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related usages and terms==
[[Image:Nietzsche187a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]]]
Several other uses of the term ''conatus'', apart from the primary ones mentioned above, have been formulated by various philosophers over the centuries. There are also some important related terms and concepts which have, more or less, similar meanings and usages. [[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) defined ''conatus'' as the essence of human [[society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goulding|2005|p=22040}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also, in a more traditional, [[hylozoism|hylozoistic]] sense, as the generating power of movement which pervades all of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vico|1710|pp=180–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a century after the beginnings of modern science, Vico, inspired by [[Neoplatonism]], explicitly rejected the principle of inertia and the laws of motion of the new physics. For him, nature was composed neither of atoms, as in the dominant view, nor of extension, as in Descartes, but of ''metaphysical points'' animated by a ''conatus'' principle provoked by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landucci|2004|pp=1174,1175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860) developed a philosophy that contains a principle notably similar to that of Hobbes's ''conatus''. This principle, ''Wille zum Leben'', or "Will to Live", described the specific phenomenon of an organism's self-preservation instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rabenort|1911|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer qualified this, however, by suggesting that the Will to Live is not limited in duration. Rather, "the will wills absolutely and for all time", across generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schopenhauer|1958|p=568}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900), an early disciple of Schopenhauer, developed a separate principle which comes out of a rejection of the primacy of Schopenhauer's Will to Live and other notions of self-preservation. He called his version the [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|Will to Power]], or ''Wille zur Macht''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Durant|Durant|1963|loc=chp. IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Nietzsche criticized Spinoza's ''conatus'' principle, arguing that if true, it would allegedly favour a stagnant Universe. He thought "the opposite is true"; every organism strives not to just to persevere, but to "become more" than it is and to exert its creative strength. Spinoza's conatus, however, was much more alike to such an understanding than to simple self-preservation, as it was akin to empowerment. DIFFICULT TO SOURCE: SEE TALK PAGE--&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939), greatly depended on Spinoza's formulation of the ''conatus'' principle as a system of self-preservation, though he never cited him directly in any of his published works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), developed the principle of the ''[[élan vital]]'', or "vital impulse", which was thought to aid in the [[evolution]] of [[organism]]s. This concept, which implies a fundamental driving force behind all life, is reminiscent of the ''conatus'' principle of Spinoza and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schrift|2006|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Max Scheler]], the concept of ''Drang'' is the centerpiece of [[philosophical anthropology]] and [[metaphysics]].  Though his concept has been important throughout his entire philosophical career, it was only developed later in his life when his focus shifted from phenomenology to metaphysics.  Like Bergson's ''élan vital,'' ''Drang'' (drive or impulsion) is the impetus of all life; however, unlike in Bergson's vitalistic metaphysics, the significance of Drang is that it provides the motivation and driving force even of Spirit (''Geist'').  Spirit, which includes all theoretical intentionality, is powerless without the movement of ''Drang'', the material principle, as well as ''Eros'', the psychological principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheler|2008|pp=231–41, 323–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] (1911–1988), described a ''cultural conatus'' built directly upon Spinoza's seminal definition in IIIP3&lt;!--reread this book--&gt; of his ''Ethics''. The principle behind this derivative concept states that any given culture, "tends to persevere in its being, whether by dominating other cultures or by struggling against their domination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Polt|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern significance==
&lt;!--conation--&gt;

===Physical===
After the advent of Newtonian physics, the concept of a ''conatus'' of all physical bodies was largely superseded by the principle of [[inertia]] and [[conservation of momentum]]. As Bidney states, "It is true that logically desire or the ''conatus'' is merely a principle of inertia&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;the fact remains, however, that this is not Spinoza's usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''conatus'' was used by many philosophers to describe other concepts which have slowly been made obsolete. ''Conatus recendendi'', for instance, became the centrifugal force, and [[gravity]] is used where ''conatus a centro'' had been previously.&lt;ref name="Koll" /&gt; Today, the topics with which ''conatus'' dealt are matters of [[science]] and are thus subject to inquiry by the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological===
The archaic concept of ''conatus'' is today being reconciled with modern biology by scientists such as [[Antonio Damasio]].&lt;!--psychology and philosophy. --&gt; The ''conatus'' of today, however, is explained in terms of chemistry and neurology where, before, it was a matter of metaphysics and [[theurgy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept may be "constructed so as to maintain the coherence of a living [[organism]]'s structures and functions against numerous life-threatening odds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--NEED SOURCE This stability required to maintain life can also refer to the notion of [[homeostasis]] developed by [[Claude Bernard]] which later inspired the field of [[cybernetics]].--&gt;&lt;!--ALSO NEED SOURCE This ''conatus'' is similar to modern notions of the [[libido]] in the [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] sense, and the animal directive of [[self-preservation]].--&gt;

====Systems theory====
The Spinozistic conception of a ''conatus'' was a historical precursor to modern theories of [[autopoiesis]] in biological systems.&lt;ref name=ziemke6&gt;{{Harvnb|Ziemke|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[systems theory]] and the [[sciences]] in general, the concept of a ''conatus'' may be related to the phenomenon of [[emergence]], whereby [[complex systems]] may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's ''conatus'' principle;&lt;ref name=sandy144145&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandywell|1996|pp=144–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.&lt;ref name=mathews110&gt;{{Harvnb|Mathews|1991|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3610">{{for|the book|Domnei: A Comedy of Woman-Worship}}
'''Domnei''' or '''donnoi''' is an [[Old Occitan|Old Provençal]] term meaning the attitude of [[chivalrous]] devotion of a [[knight]] to his [[Lady]], which was mainly a non-physical and non-marital relationship.

[[Image:Accolade by Edmund Blair Leighton.jpg| thumb | right | 270px | "The Accolade" by [[Edmund Blair Leighton]], painted in 1901, clearly expresses the concept of Domnei]]

==Principles==
This type of relationship was highly ritualized and complex but was generally considered to be non-physical. In discussing the history of Provençal Poetry ([[Occitan literature]]), [[Claude Charles Fauriel]] asserts: "He who wants to fully possess his lady knows nothing of 'donnoi'."&lt;ref&gt;Fauriel, C. Histoire de la Poesie provencale.  Paris, 1846.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guilhem de Montanhagol]] (1233–1268), a Provençal [[troubadour]], declared: "E d'amor mou castitaz", or, "From love comes chastity".

The [[Knighthood|chevalier]]'s devotion to his lady functioned by his servitude to her both in terms of his code of conduct and courtly duties. [[Chivalry]] as a code, as indicated by the concepts of [[courtly love]] and the quality of Domnei, necessitated in theory as in practice a level of devotion to the lady, or high mistress, that went beyond mere professionalism and graciousness in etiquette. Truth and honesty were core virtues, and therefore, a knight's actions were to stem from honorable intentions, sincere motives, and purity of heart. Therefore, in matters of the heart, courtly love wasn't always plausibly separable or indistinguishable from [[romantic love]].

However, by [[Eros]], by [[Cupid]]'s arrow, the object of a knight's affections may have resided elsewhere outside of his formal duties to his lady. In some instances, the lady was chosen, as in assigned to a knight by happenstance, whereby direct interaction may have been unlikely. As a ''[[princesse lointaine]]'', she may have lived in a far away castle by which the chevalier could never, and would never have the chance to know her. Despite the confines of romantic impossibility, obligations of courtly love and Domnei were to persevere out of a chivalrous sense of loyalty and devotion for a knight to his lady. Realities as they were, such as [[unrequited love]] as an example, often provided the basis for contributing to many tales of love and legend in [[Medieval Literature]] and [[Medieval poetry]].

==Other modern usage==
===The Cabell book===
In modern times, the term "Domnei" is especially known for its usage in the title and plot of ''[[Domnei: A Comedy of Woman-Worship]]'', a 1913 fantasy novel by [[James Branch Cabell]], which is set in the imaginary French province of [[Poictesme]] during the second half of the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Lineage of Lichfield'' Cabell fixed the period covered by the novel as August 1256 to July 1274.  See James Branch Cabell ''The Cream of the Jest, The Lineage of Lichfield: Two Comedies of Evasion'' (London: Pan/Ballantine, 1972) p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Gallico book===
In [[Paul Gallico]]'s novel ''[[Adventures of Hiram Holliday]]'' the protagonist is a twentieth century American consciously seeking to model himself on the Medieval knights of romantic literature and to live by the Code of [[Chivalry]] in modern society. Domnei-style woman-worship is offered to an exiled [[Habsburg]] princess who he saves from Nazi agents and with whom he falls in love.

'''Erambie Mission''' is an [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] community located on the western banks of the [[Lachlan River]], 2.5 kilometres (1.5 miles) from the town of [[Cowra]], in the [[Central West, New South Wales|Central West]] region of [[New South Wales]], Australia.

The mission is laid out along three streets in a grid of tightly packed houses, but it contains no shops or library. It became home for most of the 700 Aboriginal people in the Cowra area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bamblett |first= Lawrence |date= |title=Community Engagement and English Literacy Outcomes at Erambie Mission |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-337617940/read-with-me-everyday-community-engagement-and-english |journal=Australian Aboriginal Studies |publisher= |volume=2013, No. 1 |issue=Spring 2013 |pages= |doi= |access-date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents had to obey many rules and regulations, and as far back as the 1940s the mission had a reputation for Aboriginal protests, and for its residents standing up for their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/awaye/aunty-sylvia-scott-ingram/3670158 |title=Aunty Sylvia Scott (Ingram) |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=13 September 2008 |website= |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Dikötter''' ({{IPAc-en|d|iː|ˈ|k|ʌ|t|ər}}; {{zh|t=馮客|p=Féng Kè}}) is a Dutch historian who specialises in [[modern China]]. 

==Work==
Dikötter is best known as the author of ''[[Mao's Great Famine]]'', which won the 2011 [[Samuel Johnson Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mao's Great Famine wins Samuel Johnson Prize|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14045941|accessdate=8 July 2011|publisher=BBC|date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dikötter is chair professor of humanities at the [[University of Hong Kong]], where he teaches courses on both [[Mao Zedong]] and the [[Great Chinese Famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hku.hk/history/people/staff-frank-dikotter.html | title=Professor Frank Dikötter | publisher=[[University of Hong Kong]] | accessdate=7 January 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716204459/http://www0.hku.hk/history/people/staff-frank-dikotter.html | archivedate=16 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was formerly a professor of the modern history of China from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] at the [[University of London]].

[[Pankaj Mishra]] has described Dikötter's work as "boldly and engagingly revisionist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/12/20/101220crbo_books_mishra?currentPage=all | title=Staying Power: Mao and the Maoists | author=[[Pankaj Mishra]] | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a public dispute between Dikötter and Mishra.&lt;ref&gt;http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/interview-frank-dik%C3%B6tter-author-maos-great-famine-updated&lt;/ref&gt;

Dikötter asserted the impact of the prohibition of [[opium]] on the Chinese people led to greater harm than the effects of the drug itself in ''Narcotic Culture'' and ''Patient Zero''. These works have been poorly received by academics, with Chinese historian [[Kathleen L. Lodwick]] saying &lt;blockquote&gt;''Narcotic Culture'' appears to be one of the revisionist histories of which there have been several lately that have aimed at convincing us that imperialism wasn't all that bad, or at least that we should not blame the imperialists, in this case the opium traders who made vast fortunes from the trade, for the social problems they created. Closer attention to accuracy in the bibliography would have caught some errors, which appear more than once and so are not simply typos.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160305011348/http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cri/summary/v012/12.1lodwick01.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; He called for the rehabilitation of the history of [[Republican China]] between 1912 and 1949 in ''[[The Age of Openness]]''. His most recent books ''[[Mao's Great Famine]]'' and ''[[The Tragedy of Liberation]]'' deal with the early years of the People's Republic of China and specifically the terror and famine associated with it.

'''George Dyson''' (born 26 March 1953) is an American-Canadian non-fiction [[author]] and [[historian]] of technology whose publications broadly cover the evolution of technology in relation to the physical environment and the direction of society.&lt;ref name="motherobit" /&gt; He has written on a wide range of topics, including the history of computing, the development of algorithms and intelligence, communication systems, space exploration, and the design of water craft.

Lecturing widely at academic institutions, corporations, and tech conferences, Dyson gives a historical context to the evolution of technology in modern society and provides thought-provoking ideas on the directions in which technology and the Internet might develop.

==Early life==
George Dyson is the son of the theoretical physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] and mathematician [[Verena Huber-Dyson]], the brother of technology analyst [[Esther Dyson]], and the grandson of the British composer [[George Dyson (composer)|Sir George Dyson]].  Dyson's early life is described in [[Kenneth Brower]]'s book ''The Starship and the Canoe.''&lt;ref&gt;Brower, K. (1978) ''The Starship and the Canoe'', {{ISBN|978-0-03-039196-5}}. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was sixteen he went to live in [[British Columbia]] to pursue his interest in [[kayaking]].

From 1972–75, he lived in a [[treehouse]] at a height of 30 metres that he built from salvaged materials on the shore of [[Burrard Inlet]].  Dyson became a Canadian citizen and spent 20 years in British Columbia, designing kayaks, researching historic voyages and native peoples, and exploring the [[Inside Passage]]. He was, during this period, estranged from his father for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Brower | first = Kenneth | date = 27 October 2010 | title = The Danger of Cosmic Genius | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/12/the-danger-of-cosmic-genius/308306/?single_page=true | website = theatlantic.com | accessdate = 3 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Dyson's first book, ''Baidarka'', published in 1986, described his research on the history of the Aleut kayak, its evolution in the hands of Russian fur traders, and his adaptation of its design to modern materials. He is the author of ''[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]: The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965'' and ''Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence'', in which he expands upon the premise of [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s [[Darwin among the Machines|1863 article of the same name]] and suggests that the [[Internet]] is a living, sentient being. His 2012 book ''Turing's Cathedral'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/books/ci_20822829/summers-books-offer-good-reads-just-about-every|title=The summer's books offer good reads for just about every taste|last=Maslin|first=Janet|date=June 10, 2012|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as "a creation myth of the digital universe." It was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times 2012 Book Prize in the science and technology category&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-la-times-book-prize-finalists-announced-20130220,0,2764278.story|title=Announcing the 2012 L.A. Times Book Prize finalists|last=Kellogg|first=Carolyn|date=February 20, 2013|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was chosen by University of California Berkeley's annual "On the Same Page" program for the academic year 2013–14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=On the Same Page with George Dyson: The Dawn of the Computer Age |url=http://computerage-onthesamepage.berkeley.edu/ |publisher=University of California Berkeley |accessdate=January 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113065602/http://computerage-onthesamepage.berkeley.edu/ |archivedate=January 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson is the founder/owner of Dyson, Baidarka &amp; Company, a designer of [[Aleut people|Aleut]]-style skin [[kayak]]s; he is credited with the revival of the [[baidarka]] style of kayak.

Dyson was a visiting lecturer and research associate at Western Washington University's [[Fairhaven College]] and was Director's Visitor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey, in 2002–03. He is a frequent contributor to the [[Edge Foundation]].

==Personal life==
He lives and works in [[Bellingham]], Washington and is the father of Lauren Dyson.

'''Henry Margenau''' (April 30, 1901 – February 8, 1997) was a German-American [[physicist]], and [[philosopher of science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adair, Robert|authorlink=Robert Adair (physicist)|title=Obituary: Henry Margenau|journal=Physics Today|date=August 1997|volume=50|issue=8|pages=77–78|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v50/i8/p77_s2?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.881864|bibcode = 1997PhT....50R..77A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in [[Bielefeld]], Germany, Margenau obtained his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Midland Lutheran College]], [[Nebraska]] before his [[M.Sc.]] from the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1926, and PhD from [[Yale University]] in 1929.

===World War II===
Margenau worked on the theory of [[microwave]]s and the development of [[duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]]ing systems that enabled a single [[radar]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] both to transmit and receive signals. He also worked on [[spectral line broadening]], a technique used to analyse and review the dynamics of the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]].

===Philosophy and history  of science===
Margenau wrote extensively on science, his works including: ''Ethics and Science'', ''The Nature of Physical Reality'', ''Quantum Mechanics'' and ''Integrative Principles of Modern Thought''.

===Free Will===

In 1968, Margenau was invited to give the Wimmer Lecture at [[St. Vincent College]] in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. His topic was Scientific Indeterminism and Human Freedom. Margenau embraced [[indeterminism]] as the first step toward a solution of the problem of human freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific Indeterminism and Human Freedom'', The Archabbey Press (1968) p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in 1982, Margenau called his two-stage model of free will a "solution" to what had heretofore had been seen as mere "paradox and illusion."&lt;ref name="sky"&gt;Laurence LeShan and Henry Margenau, ''Einstein's Space and Van Gogh's Sky'', Macmillan (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; He very neatly separates "free" and "will" in a temporal sequence, as [[William James]] had done, naming the two stages simply "chance" followed by "choice."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    "Our thesis is that quantum mechanics leaves our body, our brain, at any moment in a state with numerous (because of its complexity we might say innumerable) possible futures, each with a predetermined probability. Freedom involves two components: chance (existence of a genuine set of alternatives) and choice. Quantum mechanics provides the chance, and we shall argue that only the mind can make the choice by selecting (not energetically enforcing) among the possible future courses." &lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', p.240&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religious interests===
Margenau served on a commission of the [[World Council of Churches]] in developing an [[ecumenical]] position on [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[atomic war]]fare.  However, his book The ''Miracle of Existence'' (Ox Bow Press, 1984) shows Margenau's broad interests not only in Christianity, but also in Eastern religions and his fascination with finding connections among different religious and philosophical traditions.

===Post-war Yale===
Margenau was appointed Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics and Natural Philosophy as Yale in 1950, a post he was to hold until his retirement from formal academic life in 1986. He also became a staff member at both the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton]] and the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]]. During his working career, he acted as consultant to the [[U.S. Air Force]], the U.S. [[National Bureau of Standards]], [[Argonne National Laboratory]], [[Rand Corporation]], [[General Electric Co.]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]].

Margenau's work embraced investigation of [[intermolecular force]]s, [[spectroscopy]], [[nuclear physics]] and [[electronics]]. He was also interested in [[parapsychology]].&lt;ref&gt;McConnell, Robert A. (1981). ''Encounters with Parapsychology''. Pittsburgh. pp. 118-126&lt;/ref&gt; He co-authored parapsychological papers with his friend [[Lawrence LeShan]].&lt;ref&gt;LeShan, Lawrence. (1984). ''From Newton to ESP''. Turnstone Press. pp. 13, 200&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to Liesel Noe and the couple parented two sons and a daughter. Margenau died in [[Hamden, Connecticut]].

'''James Herries Beattie''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|MBE|size=85%}} (6 June 1881 &amp;ndash; 11 May 1972) was a New Zealand bookkeeper, journalist, historian, ethnologist and bookseller. He was born in [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]], [[Southland Region|Southland]], [[New Zealand]] on 6 June 1881.&lt;ref name="DNZB Beattie"&gt;{{DNZB|title=James Herries Beattie|first= Atholl|last= Anderson|id=4b16|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
James Herries Beattie (known as Herries) was the son of Scottish immigrants James Beattie and Mary Roden (Rodden) Thomson, who arrived in Otago in 1862 and were married in 1874. After some years of farming, James Beattie opened a drapery business in Gore, where he became a well-known figure and was mayor for four terms. Herries was born in Gore on 6 June 1881. He was one of nine children, four of whom died young. The family was deeply religious, Presbyterian at first and Congregational from 1892. Herries, who served 40 years as a Sunday school teacher, later joined the Open Brethren.

Alongside strong Protestant convictions, Herries Beattie had a high regard for learning. He had wide interests in literature and natural history but was not gifted academically. After two years at Southland Boys' High School, Invercargill, he left in 1896 to work in the family business as a bookkeeper. This was less from choice than from filial duty, and the tedium of the job served only to further stimulate a powerful desire – present since childhood – to write.

===Early interest===
His earliest interests had been in local wildlife, especially birds, but as a youth he tried his hand at poetry, short stories and historical novels. The latter reflected an intense curiosity about the history of Otago and Southland. From an early age Beattie had sought out surviving pioneers of European settlement. By the age of 11 he 'was well and truly smitten with the history microbe' and had begun to keep notebooks recording the recollections of pioneer families around Gore and those of the surviving whalers and other old identities at Bluff and Riverton, many of them descendants of marriages into the Maori community.

The content and style of Beattie's work can be traced to a number of early influences. His first attempt at a historical work was a biography of his uncle, William Adam of the Taieri Plain. As a young man, Adam had formed a strong acquaintance with Maori of the Henley area, from whom he gained a detailed knowledge of traditions and ways of life. Beattie had spent holidays at Otokia with his uncle, through whom he made his first contacts in the southern Otago Maori community, and began to develop a wide-ranging and lasting interest in the traditional lifestyle and history of Ngai Tahu in southern New Zealand. Another important influence on his nascent career was the Southland pioneer W. H. S. Roberts. He assisted Beattie's 'chronicling apprenticeship' and provided a nucleus of information about the early southern runs and runholders around which Beattie constructed later publications. His interests in placenames, and his style of writing about them, can also be traced to Roberts's Maori nomenclature.

Beattie was familiar with the archive-based regional histories of his time, such as T. M. Hocken's Contributions to the early history of New Zealand (Otago), and Robert McNab's Murihiku; but lacking academic training, and with opportunities for collecting first-hand accounts all about him, his writings were based upon interviews, buttressed with information from family notes, genealogies, and newspaper articles amongst more orthodox sources. From such material Beattie developed his own eclectic, anecdotal style. His first publication, in 1898, was a short history of Gore for the Southern Standard, but his earliest major work was a two-part history of early settlers, Pioneer recollections (1909, 1911). Next came his detailed account of southern Maori traditions, history and placenames, based in part on Maori interviews, which was published in the Journal of the Polynesian Society between 1915 and 1922.

===Career===
As this work began to bring him to the notice of professional ethnologists, Beattie sought ways of developing a career closer to his intellectual interests. He first attempted to become a schoolteacher, but failed the examination, then in 1916 he accepted a substantial drop in salary to become a journalist with the Mataura Ensign. By 1919 his publishing success, and the acceptance of papers for the Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute, persuaded H. D. Skinner at the Otago University Museum to fund a year-long ethnological survey of southern Maori communities. This was carried out in 1920, and it set the pattern for most of Beattie's subsequent work.

On a salary of £5 per week, Beattie travelled by train and bicycle to isolated Maori communities. He gave small presents out of courtesy but did not pay for interviews. As a young man he had relied on his memory to write up conversations, but now he prepared written questions in advance, beginning with 65 and ending up with about a thousand. These were worked through patiently with his informants, who were often 70 to 80 years old; the interviews sometimes took many days to complete. Beattie had a working knowledge of Maori, but no facility in speaking it, so his interviews were conducted in English, though usually with a younger member of the informant's family to translate as needed. His most important contacts were Hone (Teone) Taare Tikao at Rapaki and Eruete Kingi Kurupohatu at Kaka Point, but others who provided much of his information during more than 60 years of periodic fieldwork were Tiemi Haereroa Kupa, Erute Poko Cameron, Taare Reweti Te Maiharoa and Tuhituhi Te Marama.

Beattie held the Maori elders in high regard (less so the younger generation), and he seems to have been received well on most occasions. Some clearly regarded him as offering the last chance to preserve substantial areas of traditional knowledge that they thought were not properly appreciated by their descendants. His survey in 1920 was incomplete, however, because he gained little from people who had lived at Otakou and Kaiapoi and he lacked the time and resources to go far beyond Christchurch from his base at Weston, near Oamaru. He also obtained only limited material on Westland and districts to the north. Nevertheless, the 1920 ethnological project was the major achievement of his career. It produced more than 1,000 closely written pages of information; failing to get this published at the time, Beattie mined it extensively for his subsequent books. It was published in 1994 as Traditional lifeways of the southern Maori.

===Research===
In 1921 Beattie was employed as librarian and ethnologist at the New Plymouth Public Library. He had married Mary McKenzie at Gore on 25 May 1910, and concerns about his wife's health brought him south again, to purchase a bookshop in Waimate. He ran that business until 1939, the earliest he could get an acceptable price for it after the depression, but remained in Waimate and, at the age of 59, was finally able to devote himself fully to writing and publication. Besides smaller works and pamphlets aimed at the tourist market, Beattie produced many works of lasting importance. By the end of his career his prolific writing had produced 27 books, of which 12 were on the Pakeha pioneers and 10 on Maori. These included Tikao talks (1939), Maori lore of lake, alp and fiord (1945), and Our southernmost Maoris (1954). The remaining five were on scenic and tourist attractions.

These works reveal the strengths and weaknesses of Beattie's approach. He systematically interviewed Maori elders and Pakeha pioneers, and constructed from their recollections detailed accounts of history and ways of life that greatly amplify, and occasionally challenge, other accounts. Yet, in the case of Maori especially, it is not always obvious to which informant material should be attributed, and his original notebooks were not preserved. Beattie used the widest range of material and showed explicitly how his arguments and conclusions were revised as new evidence came to hand, but he did not discriminate between sources of varying quality. His major works retain the scrapbook nature of their origins and are written in a colloquial style. In their time, they were regarded with suspicion by academic historians and anthropologists who preferred the more conventional publications on Maori by Elsdon Best, and this served to reinforce a perception of northern Maori traditions and customs as the New Zealand standard.

With the recent acceptance attained by oral history and a resurgence of interest in the distinctiveness of southern Maori, Beattie's research has achieved a more general esteem. In his collection of original material from oral sources in the South Island, he can be compared with Edward Shortland and Walter Mantell, but otherwise has no peer. In 1941 Beattie was awarded the Percy Smith Prize for achievements in anthropology, and in 1967 was made an MBE in recognition of his historical research and writing.

===Death===
Herries Beattie died at Timaru on 11 May 1972. Mary Beattie had died in 1944, and a son also predeceased him. He was survived by three daughters.

'''Hongjun Laozu''' ({{zh|s=鸿钧老祖|t=鴻鈞老祖|p= Hóngjūn Lǎozǔ |w=Hung-chün Lao-tsu}}) [[Literal translation|lit.]] "Ancestor of the Great Balance" is a [[deity]] in [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Taoism]], patriarch of the [[Three Pure Ones]] in Taoist mythology. ''Hongjun''  鴻鈞 is a [[Variant Chinese character|graphic variant]] of ''hungjun'' ({{zh|s=洪钧|t=洪鈞|p=''hóngjūn''|w=''hung-chün''}}) "primordial nature", as used in the [[Chinese idiom]] ''Xian you hongjun hou you tian'' 先有鸿钧后有天 "First there was Nature and then there was Heaven".

Daoists mythologize Hongjun Laozu as the ancestor of ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "trancendents; immortals" (Werner 1922:133-134) and use the honorific name '''Hongyuan Laozu''' ({{zh|s=鸿元老祖|t=鴻元老祖|p= Hóngyuán Lǎozǔ |w=Hung-yuan Lao-tsu}}) "Great Primal Ancestor". In [[Chinese creation myth]]s, ''hongyuan'' 鸿元 or 洪元 is a [[cosmological]] term for "the universe before the separation of heaven and earth".

Some myths about the creator [[Pangu]] (Werner 1922:128-130) refer to Hongjun Laozu as '''Xuanxuan Shangren''' ({{zh|s=玄玄上人|t=玄玄上人|p=Xuánxuán Shàngrén|w=Hsüan-hsüan Shang-jen}}) "Mystery of Mysteries Saint" (a reference to the ''[[Daodejing]]'' 1, tr. Mair 1990:59, "Mystery or mysteries, the gate of all wonders!").

== Myth ==
Hongjun Laozu was the monk who is told about in the myth of [[Chinese New Year]]. He was the person who captured [[Nian]], the great beast that terrorised the people of [[China]] every Chinese New Year.

Every Chinese New Year was a time of suffering and fear for the people of China because of [[Nian]], the great beast. One Chinese New Year's Eve, the monk, Hongjun Laozu, came to a village in [[China]]. He saw how everyone looked sad and frightened, so he went to a young man and said "Why are you so sad? It is [[Chinese New Year]], a time for celebration." The man replied "Do you not know? Have you not heard about [[Nian]]? He comes every New Year and terrorises us, even eats us." The monk said "I will go and reason with [[Nian]]." So off he went, to find [[Nian]].

When Hongjun Laozu came to [[Nian]], he said "[[Nian]], I have come to reason with you. Stop eating and terrorising the people of [[China]]." But [[Nian]] Said "Haha. You have delivered yourself to me, old man, so now I will eat you." The man replied, "Oh, but what will that prove? Eating me isn't great! Would you dare to eat the poisonous snakes on the mountains?" "Bah! What's so difficult about that?" So [[Nian]] went to the poisonous snakes and ate them up. "How is this? Am I not great?" "At the back of the mountain there are many great beasts. Can you subdue them?" So Nian went and scared all of the dangerous beasts out of the back of the mountain.

"Old man, now its time for me to eat you!" "Sure, but just wait while I take my clothes off, I will taste much better then". So the old man took his clothes off to reveal his undergarments, which were red. "OK, you can eat me now." But [[Nian]] said "Ah! a red undergarment! I dearly hate red, get out of my sight quickly." "Haha! I knew you were afraid of red!" The old man went into the town on top of [[Nian]] and said "Dear villagers, do not be afraid. [[Nian]] is most terrified of red. From now on each house must paste red on each of their doors to prevent [[Nian]] creating havoc."

After that, the people started to paste red paper on their front doors before [[Chinese New Year|New Year's Day]].

==Biography==
Daumet was the winner of the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1855, and in 1861 conducted a treasure-hunting expedition to Macedonia at the request of [[Napoleon III]], accompanying the archaeologist [[Léon Heuzey]].  On his return he married the daughter of architect [[Charles-Auguste Questel]].

Daumet founded his own atelier which would produce nine further Grand Prix winners, [[Charles-Louis Girault]] chief among them, and attracted a number of foreign students such as [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] and [[Austin W. Lord]].  

In 1908 Daumet won the [[Royal Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].

==Background==
Before the insurgency [[Preševo Valley]] was home to approximately 100,000 people, of whom 70,000 were [[Albanians in Serbia|Albanians]] and another 30,000 Serbs. Albanians make up to 95% of [[Preševo]], 40% of [[Bujanovac]] and 10% of [[Medveđa]] population. The region is sometimes referred to as Eastern Kosovo by Albanians.
The Albanian-populated region became a part of Serbia in 1913, after [[First Balkan War]]
[[File:Serbia1945.png|alt=Presevo Valley was a part of Kosovo until 1946|thumb|Map of Federal State of Serbia compared to present-day borders({{Legend0|#7F7F7F|Present-day border changes}} {{Legend0|#000|1945 borders}})]]
From 1945 to 1946 [[Preševo]] and [[Bujanovac]] were a part of newly established [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Autonomous Oblast of Kosovo and Metohija]] inside Federal State of Serbia. In 1946 they were transferred to [[Central Serbia]] in exchange for a part of Serb inhabited modern-day [[North Kosovo]]. During the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], on 1 and 2 March 1992 Albanians from [[Preševo Valley]] held the referendum about their future status in Serbia. The majority, 97% of voters demanded autonomy for the valley and the right to join [[Republic of Kosova]]. Serbian government rejected the referendum as anti-constitutional and illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/210242/Albanci-sa-juga-Srbije-ostaju-dosledni-referendumu-iz-1992|title=Албанци са југа Србије остају доследни референдуму из 1992.|last=|first=|date=1 March 2012|website=Politika|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kosovo Presevo location map.png|thumb|Unrecognized Republic of Kosova and Preševo Valley after 1992 referendums|alt=]]
The [[Kosovo War]] was a parallel conflict between the [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]] and the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]]. It began in February 1998 and ended on 10 June 1999 when the [[Kumanovo Treaty]] was signed. According to the treaty, [[Kosovo Force|KFOR troops]], supervised by the [[United Nations]], would enter as a peacekeeping force, while Yugoslav military forces were to withdraw. It was agreed that the KLA would disband by 19 September 1999. According to the agreement there will be demilitarized zone around Kosovo. Serbs could only use police squads with up to  10 members. This buffer zone was used by Albanian guerrillas for attacks against Serbian forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/440461.stm|work=BBC News|title=KLA future in the balance|date=7 September 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928082029/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/440461.stm|archivedate=28 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Preševo valley conflict erupted in June 1999.

== Ground Safety Zone ==
After [[Kumanovo Agreement]] was signed, 5 km (3 mil) deep demilitarized zone was established along Kosovo border. Length of the zone was 382 km along Serbian border. The purpose of this buffer was to prevent incidents between [[Kosovo Force|KFOR troops]] and [[Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav army]]. At the same time Air Safety Zone was set up. It's width was 20 km. Only lightly armed police force of up to ten members was allowed to patrol, so keeping order in this area was very hard. It was prohibited for Serbs to use planes, tanks or any other heavier weapons. GSZ became the heaven for drug trade and operations against Serb forces. Zone consisted of following sectors:

* Sector C west - from [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] to border with Albania
* Sector A - from [[Rožaje]] to [[Medveđa]]
* Sector D - parts of [[Medveđa]], [[Leskovac]], [[Lebane]] and [[Vranje]] municipalities
* Sector B - from [[Medveđa]] to [[Preševo]]
* Sector C east - border with [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to village of [[Norča]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2001&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_category=1&amp;nav_id=23214|title=SNAGE BEZBEDNOSTI DO KRAJA DANA U ZONI BEZBEDNOSTI|last=|first=|date=25 March 2001|website=B92|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UÇPMB ==
[[Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac]] members were first seen during funeral of brothers Shaqipi who were killed by the police in January 2000 in [[Dobrosin]]. They had around 1,600 active fighters and around 5,000 non-active. The Yugoslav government considered it a terrorist organization. Organization consisted of three zones. First was South zone commanded by Shaqir Shaqiri. After he was arrested in 2001, he was replaced by Mustafa Shaqiri. They had between 300-500 fighters. Center zone was commanded by Ridvan Qazimi, known as "Captain Lleshi", who had around 600 rebels. Lleshi was later killed in [[Battle of Oraovica|clashes near]] [[Oraovica (Preševo)|Oraovica]]. This zone was around [[Gjilan]]-[[Bujanovac]] regional road. In the north there was so called [[Čar]] group, or North zone lead by Muhamet Xhemajli. Highest commander was Shefket Musliu auto mechanic from [[Končulj]]. Rebels mostly had mine throwers and other light weapons. Those weapons were transported illegally from Kosovo throughout border with Serbia. The biggest Albanian village in Serbia, [[Veliki Trnovac]], was the rebel center. According to [[Security Intelligence Agency|Serbian Security Intelligence Agency]] it was full of bunkers, as well as laboratories and storehouses for [[heroin]]. PMBLA was operating in following villages:

* North zone - [[Muhovac]] ''(command)'', [[Ravno Bučje (Bujanovac)|Ravno Bučje]], [[Pribovce]], [[Zarbince]], [[Suharno]], [[Đorđevac]], [[Čar]]
* Center zone - [[Veliki Trnovac]] ''(command)'', Breznica, [[Mali Trnovac]], [[Dobrosin]], [[Končulj]], [[Lučane]] and [[Turija (Bujanovac)|Turija]]

Rebels were controlling all villages in GSZ sector B and C east except [[Cerevajka]] and [[Gramada (Bujanovac)|Gramada]].

== History ==

=== 1999 ===
After [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] disbanded according to the peace agreement that ended [[Kosovo War]], its veterans and members founded [[Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac]] in a village of [[Dobrosin]]. Their goal was secession of three Albanian populated municipalities from [[Serbia]] and their annexation to Kosovo. Fighting between police and separatist began in June 1999 in municipality of [[Kuršumlija]], and later spread to [[Medveđa]], [[Bujanovac]] and [[Preševo]]. The UÇPMB established many bases in mountains and plains around towns of Bujanovac and Preševo. Main center of militants was a village of [[Veliki Trnovac]]. Because of restricted movement in that area, police and army were unable to stop them. On 21 November two policeman were killed by land mine.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.292.html:378228-Uhapseni-Albanci-otimali-i-kasapili-Srbe|title=Uhapšeni Albanci otimali i kasapili Srbe|date=4 May 2012|accessdate=27 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708083604/http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.292.html:378228-Uhapseni-Albanci-otimali-i-kasapili-Srbe|archivedate=8 July 2012|deadurl=no|publisher=Večernje Novosti|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbs responded on attacks with more checkpoints and patrols. During 1999 rebels didn’t enter a open conflict with the police. Instead they battled them with the mortars from the distance, so Serbs were unable to respond.

Conflict escalated in 2000. On 16 January three Serbs civilians from village [[Pasjane]] were killed by rebels in a Ground Safety Zone on a road [[Gjilan]] - [[Preševo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2000&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=18&amp;nav_category=1&amp;nav_id=4019|title=Ubijena tri clana porodice Nojic iz Pasjana|last=|first=|date=16 January 2000|website=B92|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After overthrow of [[Slobodan Milošević]], new government requested form NATO and KFOR to suspend demilitarized zone around Kosovo, in fear that a new war could erupt.

== Clashes around Bujanovac ==
In July 2000 PMBLA launched an offensive in order to take the town of [[Bujanovac]]. The battle was conducted in the areas of [[Končulj]], [[Dobrosin]], [[Lučane]] and Devojačka Čuka as well as in the wider area around [[Mali Trnovac]], [[Muhovac]] and [[Đorđevac]]. The PMBLA clashes with the Serbian security forces began in July 2000 and were aimed at conquering the communication [[Bujanovac]]-[[Gjilan]] and taking over the villages of the municipality of [[Bujanovac]]. The fighting was intensified in November 2000, when the police, under the influence of a threefold strength of the PMBLA, withdrew from the security checkpoints that were fought, occupying defensive positions closer to [[Bujanovac]]. The fighting broke into a pat-position at the end of November 2000 after the arrival of the JSO as well as military and police reinforcements to the south of Serbia. The conflicts were of low intensity, and were mainly reduced to occasional rebel attacks where the police only responded when the lives of its members were endangered. The offensive PMBLA in the battle near [[Bujanovac]] started on 21 November 2000, after two days of provocations and strong attacks on the positions of the police. That day, about 500 guerrillas, who were incomparably better armed than the police, were unhindered from Kosovo to the municipality of [[Bujanovac]], and in addition to the presence of strong forces of the American KFOR contingent with the administrative line of Serbia and Kosovo.

In the period from 12.25 to 17.00 hours on 21 November, Albanians committed synchronized attacks on the [[Dobrosin]] security checkpoint, and on the positions of the police on the corners of Devojačka Čuka and Osoje.

At 12.25, 12.55 and 15.30, attacks on the Dobrosin puncture were made from mortars, automatic and sniper weapons and machine guns, when Gropi's observatory was hit on two occasions with more than 5 mines.

At 12.48 pm, an attack from mortars, infantry weapons, machine guns and brownies was carried out to local police positions at the Devojačka Čuka Corner, and at 13.30 hours the terrorists were also operating at the corner of Osoje with a fire from a mortar.

Due to strong actions, members of the Special Police Units from Gornji Milanovac were forced to withdraw from the communication [[Končulj|Konculj]] - [[Lučane|Lucane]] - [[Bujanovac]], along the width of the road. Police withdrawal was hampered and slowed due to lack of knowledge of the terrain. During the withdrawal, a fierce infantry attack by Albanian rebels from the wider region of Tuštica and Visoko was followed when the observation post on the Gropi hill was occupied. In this attack, rebels captured three members of the MUP. They were taken to their camp in the territory of Kosovo where they were tormented by the religious leaders and eventually liquidated.

Around 17.00 hours the withdrawal of the people from the crisis zones was terminated because it was found that at the [[Dobrosin]] point there was a mortar of 60 millimeter, a sniper and automatic rifle, two combat ammunition kits, 6 inductor phones and more. Rebels then carry out another attack on the police patrol in [[Dobrosin]]. After this attack, police officers were withdrawn from the Municipality of [[Bujanovac]] in order to prevent further conflicts and reorganize police units. Thus, the rebels occupied the area around Dobrosin, Lucana, Konculja, Mali Trnovac and Breznica, as well as 4 police stations.

After the end of these conflicts, at night 21-22. In November, besides members of the American contingent of KFOR, about 1,000 rebels had been armed to their teeth, and entered the wider [[Bujanovac]] area. Among them were Albanians from Western European countries, from Albania and Kosovo, and the [[Mujahideen|mujahedin]] from the [[Middle East]]. They immediately carried out the forced mobilization of Albanian military capable men over the age of 18. They took private vehicles and sent it all to the first combat ranks.

After establishing themselves, the following day they continued with armed attacks. In the period from 11.15 to 12.05 and from 12.30 to 15.30 on 22 November, from the direction of the villages of Dobrosin and Končulj, Albanian rebels carried out attacks from automatic weapons and mortars to the police in the village of Lučane. Later, in the period between 21.45 and 23.15 hours, the rebels carried out attacks on the police in the village of Djordjevac from mortars, hand grenades (fired 20-30 mines) and infantry weapons. The next day, on 23 November, around 10:00 am, Albanian terrorists carried out an attack with 5 mines from mortars and brownies to the police patrol in the village of Djordjevac.

In response to these conflicts, the FRY demanded an urgent session of the UN Security Council to condemn the attacks. FRY President [[Vojislav Koštunica]] wrote to NATO Secretary General George Robertson with the expectation that KFOR will no longer allow incursions to southern Serbia and similar incidents. At its headquarters in Brussels, NATO emphasized that it opposed the PMBLA's downfall, while KFOR on the other announced that it would not tolerate the possible effects of the VJ in the Ground Safety Zone.

KFOR kept all the roads leading to Dobrosin, the village where the terrorists were concentrated, were blocked. During this blockade, on one track, a truck driver was arrested who tried to smuggle weapons and ammunition for terrorists through the US checkpoint. In the fireplace were mortars, anti-personnel mines, machine guns and 5,000 bullets. Searching terrain KFOR found a 62 mm mortar, 16 mortar shells, one hand grenade, one automatic rifle with 2200 bullets and 25 bullets for a pistol. This hidden weapon belonged to rebels who carried out attacks from the territory of Kosovo without crossing the administrative line. There were also 10 unarmed rebels in black uniforms who tried to illegally enter the south of Serbia.

== The Čović Plan ==
In February 2001, Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia and Head of Coordination Center for Southern Serbia [[Nebojša Čović]] proposed the plan for resolving the crisis in [[Preševo Valley]]. The plan calls for joint police forces of local ethnic Albanians and Serbs, in proportion to the ethnic groups' populations in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/albanian-guerrillas-target-the-serb-only-police-force-5365847.html|title=Albanian guerrillas target the Serb-only police force|last=|first=|date=23 February 2001|website=Indenpendent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal calls for integrating the valley's ethnic Albanian population into mainstream Serbian political and social life. It also offers civil rights guarantees and promises of economic development. The plan doesn't provide autonomy for the region or possible annexation to [[Kosovo]]. Instead it's providing decentralization to local authorities. The plan also calls for demilitarization of the [[Preševo Valley]] and disbandment of [[Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac|PMBLA]]. All rebel controlled areas should be returned to Serbia. Every rebel that surrenders will be promised a pardon from the Yugoslav government. The plan was accepted, and Albanians signed the demilitarization agreement in a village of [[Končulj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1095669.html|title=Yugoslavia: Serbia Offers Peace Plan For Presevo Valley|last=|first=|date=5 February 2001|website=RLE/RL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation Return ==

=== Return of the Yugoslav Army to Sector C - East ===
At 6.30 am on March 14, 2001, the return of the United Security Forces to the GSZ, Sector C (East Charlie), from the outer line of this zone, started. The Yugoslav forces were deployed west, from the Preševo-Miratovac line, in three directions: towards the villages of Miratovac, Norča and Trnava. Lieutenant-General Lieutenant-General Ninoslav Krstić was led by Lieutenant-General Lieutenant-Colonel Ninoslav Krstic. The Chief of the General Staff of the VJ, Lieutenant-General [[Nebojša Pavković|Nebojsa Pavković]], Commander of the Third Army, Lieutenant General [[Vladimir Lazarević]], Commander of the Priština Corps Major General Radojko Stefanović, General Obrad Stevanović and several other Yugoslav Army officers. The return operation was followed by the President of the FRY Coordination Body for South Serbia Nebojša Čović and members of the Coordination Body Mica Markovic and Milovan Čogurić. Entering sector C, on the triple border of Serbia, Macedonia and Kosovo, it was free of incidents. Already at 07.20, Nebojša Pavković told FRY President [[Vojislav Koštunica]] that the operation is taking place successfully. There were no land mines on the ground, nor did they see armed groups of Albanian terrorists. In the sky above Macedonia, several Cobra KFOR helicopters were observed that supervised the operation. In Sector C - East, the first units that entered were engineering units that were tasked with examining the whole field and eliminating the danger of the set mines. Soon, simultaneously with them, other members of the Army entered the zone led by General Pavković and other commanders. When Pavković entered the part of the C sector, Lieutenant Colonel David Olvein, a military attaché of the US Embassy, was watching events with extreme care, but at the same time he was very surprised when he received information that the planned time of 10 hours, ended up taking positions in just 2 hours.

=== Return of the Yugoslav Army C - west and sector A ===
After entering the eastern part of sector C, on March 22, 2001, the KFOR command led by General Kabigoszu, in a meeting with Yugoslav representatives in Merdare, approved the entry of the Yugoslav Army into the western part of Sector C (along the border of Montenegro and Kosovo) and sector A (to the border line with the municipality of Medveđa). The return to these parts of the GSZ, carried out by the Second Army of the YA, started at 07:00 on March 25th. According to Colonel Radosav Mihailović, the on-site operation, the operation was carried out without incidents and according to the foreseen plan, followed by members of the Coordination Body, KFOR representatives as well as EU observers. This operation restored the state sovereignty of the FRY over the border belt of municipalities: Plav, Berane, Rožaje, Tutin, Novi Pazar, Raška, Brus and Kuršumlija. The total length of the western part of Sector C and Sector A was 263 km, and the width was 5 km, that is, in total, about 1300 km².

=== Return of the Yugoslav Army to Sector D ===
The preparations of the Yugoslav Army to enter Sector D of the Ground Security Zone (the border region of Medveđa municipality) began after the meeting of General Ninoslav Krstić with the representative of KFOR in Merdare near Kuršumlija on April 2, 2001. The agreement on entry into sector D was signed in Merdare on April 12 by Ninoslav Krstić and Nebojša Čović, as well as representatives of KFOR. Earlier, Albanian rebela attacked police positions in the village of Marovac, the municipality of Medveđa, with two mortar shells, and attacked members of the local police in Beli Kamen, municipality of Medveđa. It was precisely in these regions that there were representatives of the Coordination Body who were preparing for the occupation of the sector D. After the preparations, Yugoslav forces from the outer circumference of sector D made a move from the starting positions and entry into sector D early in the morning of April 14. The operation was monitored by KFOR teams, EU observers and numerous journalists. After a successful operation during which there was no conflict, General Ninoslav Krstić praised the members of Operation Group South and especially praised the members of the battle group of police who occupied the Ravna Banja region - Moravce sector D. The situation in this sector after the entry of the Yugoslav Army was a staple and there were no provocations by Albanian rebels.

=== Return of the Yugoslav Army to Sector B ===
PMBLA Commander Sefket Musliu, Ridvan Qazmi-Lleshi and Mustafa Shaqiri, signed a demobilization and demilitarization agreement of the PMBLA on May 21 in Končulj, guaranteeing the safe and peaceful entry of the Yugoslav Army into Sector B of the Ground Safety Zone according to the following schedule : Zone B South until May 22, Zone B Center until May 31, while Zone B North was not under the control of rebels. The agreement was signed in the presence of Sean Saliven, head of the NATO office for Yugoslavia. On the same day, the commander of the United Security Forces, General Ninoslav Krstić, met with the KFOR Commander in Merdare and on that occasion a document on the return of the VJ to Sector B. was signed. To accomplish this task, new special anti-terrorist and anti-trust units of the United Security Forces have been engaged. The action was carried out with the coordination of KFOR and by May 24, the Army had occupied 90 percent of the B-South and B North zones without encountering any resistance from rebels. The operation was continued to remove mines and seize weapons, ammunition and military equipment. During the occupation of the northern zone of sector B on May 24, during the exchange of fire between the VJ and the PMBLA, the rebel commander Ridvan Qazimi, in the area of the Guri Gat Hill (Black Stone) near Veliki Trnovac, was killed. The conflict lasted from 11.30 to 15.00. Qazimi was in custody with three other extremists, and when he got up and went to his jeep, he was hit in the head. After the death of Qazimi, various stories began to circulate in the south of Serbia, from killing the infected PMBLA faction members about the distribution of the remaining plunder, to escaping to Kosovo and then to Albania. At the press conference, Nebojša Čović denounced the information that Qazimi was with Sean Sullivan at the time, and he removed doubts about the fate of Ridvan Qazimi, saying he was killed in a confrontation with Serbian security forces. He also praised the way B South and B North were occupied, adding that the Army will not enter Zone B Center, where the highest concentration of terrorists is located, until May 31. The Yugoslav Army performed the last operation during the GSZ's occupation on May 31, entering the B Center zone. The return of members of the Yugoslav Army to the central part of the sector has been restored sovereignty over this part of the territory of the FRY, and the entire action was completed by 12.00, when the Serbian security forces entered the administrative line with Kosovo. During the operation, there were no conflicts or provocations by terrorists or Albanian civilians. After entering the village of Dobrosin, the center of the terrorists, police carried out an inspection of 14 abandoned accommodation facilities. In the presence of the President of the Local Community Dobrosin Reshat Salihi, they found 2 anti-personnel mines, uniforms and military equipment, three radio stations, 100 medical items and others. During the deployment of the Yugoslav Army along the left border of the central part of Sector B, at the Visoko Bilo, sergeant Bratislav Milinković (1957), a member of the 63nd Parachute Brigade from Niš, aimed at a counter-attack mine and received a severe injury to his left leg. He was taken to the military hospital in Bujanovac and then transferred to further treatment in Niš. With the entry of the United Security Forces in the Zone B Center, Operation Return was completed and control over the entire Ground Safety Zone was restored, ending the conflicts in southern Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bujanovacpress.yubc.net/bilteni/bilten107.html PRESS Centar - Bujanovac] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041220212950/http://bujanovacpress.yubc.net/bilteni/bilten107.html}}, Приступљено 1. 4. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Battle of Oraovica ==
{{Main|Battle of Oraovica}}
The Battle of [[Oraovica (Preševo)|Oraovica]] was a conflict between Army and Police of [[FR Yugoslavia]] and Albanian militant group before Serbs entered last sector of Ground Security Zone. Since the village was outside GSZ, Yugoslav forces were allowed to use heavier weapons, such as [[M-84]] tank. On 14 May Yugoslav forces launched an attack on UÇPMB stronghold in this Albanian-populated place near the border with [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|Kosovo]]. Fighting began on 14 May at 06.10 AM by an attack on Yugoslav forces. At 07.00 AM guerrillas attacked Serbian police and army again and fired three rocket towards the village. More incidents happened during the day until 08.00 PM. On 15 May Serbian forces captured Oraovica although UÇPMB attacked them at 02.15 PM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1096448.html|title=Yugoslavia: Troops Win Tactical Victory In Presevo Valley|last=|first=|date=16 May 2001|website=RFE/RL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reoccupation of Ground Safety Zone, Serbia separated it into 3 sectors. The sector '''B''' is stretching from [[Medveđa]] to the border with [[Republic of Macedonia]]. It's controlled by [[4th Land Force Brigade]] situated in the city of [[Vranje]]. There are about eleven bases in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odbrana.mod.gov.rs/specijalni%20prilog/27/027_053_Pregovori%20o%20statusu%20Kosova%20i%20Metohije.pdf|title=SUSTINSKA AUTONOMIJA UNUTAR SRBIJE|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 largest military base in [[Serbia]], [[Cepotina]], was opened 5km from [[Bujanovac]].

The '''Jacket, Field, O.D.''' (also unofficially known as '''O.D. Cotton Field Jacket''', '''Parsons Jacket''', '''M1938''' or '''M1941''') is a field jacket that was used by [[US Army]] soldiers, most famously during the beginning of [[World War II]]. In 1941 it started to be phased in as a replacement for the wool four-pocket service coat of [[World War I]], but around 1943 it was replaced in turn by the improved [[U.S. Army M1943 Uniform|M1943]] model. Due to wide adoption, the M1941 is usually recognized as a symbol of the World War II American [[GI (military)|G.I.]]. The jacket was made in a light shade of [[olive drab]] called O.D. number 2.

==The First Field Jacket==
Through [[World War I]], soldiers in the [[United States Army]] wore a comfortable loose-fitting wool four pocket field garment, which Lieutenant General [[Edmund B. Gregory]], the Quartermaster General, later (1946) explained had then subtly changed to a tight-fitting version suitable only for garrison wear.&lt;ref name="qmfound"&gt;[http://www.qmfound.com/army_dressed_up.htm The Army Dressed Up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417020219/http://www.qmfound.com/army_dressed_up.htm |date=2008-04-17 }}, 1952, Dr. Stephen J. Kennedy, The Quartermaster Review, January/February 1952, Army Clothing History page, Army Quartermaster Foundation, Inc. Website, accessed 4-9-08.&lt;/ref&gt;  He further pointed out that this followed the general pattern adopted by most major armies of the world during the post-WWI period, but proved to be rather impractical.&lt;ref name="qmfound"/&gt;  At the end of the 1930s, the Army moved to adopt a new outer garment that was intended to be more utilitarian and provide better protection in combat.  The army's first attempts included adding a pleated "bi-swing" back to the service coat, a change adopted with the M1939 Service Coat.

The first field jacket was based on a civilian jacket suggested by Major General [[James K. Parsons]], for whom it was unofficially named.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarytour.com/Reproductions/WW11/American/Medals/M41.htm militarytour.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the service coat, the material for the jacket was more wind and water resistant. A further reason for adopting a field jacket made of a different material was that shortages of wool were expected.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, Tiffany ''US Army Field Jacket Development in Response to Material Shortages and the Exigencies of World War II'' in ''Momentum'' Vol 1 Issue 1 Article 3 18 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The jacket could be worn with both winter (OD wool) and summer (khaki chino) uniforms as well as fatigue uniforms.  The Olive Drab Cotton Field Jacket was standardized and adopted in June 1940 for use by all members of the US Army for wear with both the winter and summer service uniforms.  Jackets of similar design were later also adopted by the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].

The designations of "M1938", "M1941", or "M41" are technically incorrect. The Army Quartermaster Corps, who developed clothing, used model numbers sparingly and only used them to differentiate two or more similar types of garments from one another.  In 1940, there was only one field jacket, so there was no need to give it a model number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_clothing_jacket_m41.php olive-drab.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jacket Design==
The jacket was modeled after a civilian [[windbreaker]] design, and was constructed of an olive drab shade 3 [[cotton]] [[poplin]] outer shell with a dark olive drab blanket wool [[flannel]] lining, with shell color on new jackets was a pale pea-green color, but faded fairly quickly with heavy use and sun exposure to the more common beige-green. The jacket had a front zipper front closure with a buttoned storm flap. The jacket also had buttons at the collar for closing the lapels to warm the neck region, as well as buttoned adjusting tabs on each side of the waist and at the cuffs to seal in body heat, and buttoned shoulder epaulets. There were two front slash pockets and a notched lapel collar.  Earlier models of the jacket (M-38 Parsons jacket) do not have the shoulder epaulets, but the two front slash pockets had buttoned pocket flaps and a thinner half-belt back seam.

==World War II==
When the US entered the war in 1941, the O.D. cotton field jacket was the standard outer garment for all army personnel, except those that had other specialist clothing ([[Paratrooper#United States|Paratroopers]] wore the parachutist's coat and trousers, [[Tank#Crew|tank crews]] wore the tankers jacket, various types of  [[parka]]s were worn in cold weather, etc.).  As a result, the field jacket could be seen worn in every theater of war and by nearly every type of soldier, making a rather ubiquitous symbol of the World War II American [[GI (military)|G.I.]].

Throughout the course of the war, the O.D. cotton field jacket proved to be an inadequate outer garment. The jacket's thin lining provided poor insulation during cold weather and the light cotton shell provided little protection from wet weather and wind.  In addition, the lighter shade of OD 3 faded quickly and resulted in a beige color, thus compromising the effect of camouflage &amp;ndash; which troops in the field found out the hard way, and often turned their jackets inside-out because the wool lining was a darker shade of O.D. and didn't gleam in the sunlight like the poplin shell did.

The O.D. cotton field jacket was officially replaced with the adoption of the [[U.S. Army M1943 Uniform|M1943 uniform ensemble]] as the standard, which included the much improved M1943 field jacket. The O.D. cotton field jacket was redesignated limited standard and issued until supplies were exhausted.  Photographic evidence shows that soldiers continued to wear the older jacket all the way through the end of the war, due to supply shortages and squabbling between the Quartermaster Corps and field commanders, who all had their own ideas of what the troops should "look like".  The jackets even show up in limited use during the [[Korean War]].

'''Magnus Jacob Crusenstolpe''' (1795–1865), [[Sweden|Swedish]] historian; he became famous both as a political and a historical writer early in his career.

Crusenstolpe won considerable distinction with a series of historical-romantic tales, (Little Stories); but his fame rests mainly on his works as a journalist, historian, biographer, and politician. His works of fiction become to a degree political or progressive (see for example ''The House of Holstein-Gottorp in Sweden'').{{sfn|Warner|1917|p=159}}

Crusenstolpe obtained a great influence over King [[Charles XIV of Sweden|Charles XIV]], who during the years 1830 to 1833 gave him his fullest confidence, and sanctioned the official character of Crusenstolpe's newspaper ''Fäderneslandet''. In the last-mentioned year, however, the historian suddenly became the king's bitterest enemy, and used his acrid pen on all occasions in attacking him. In 1838 he was condemned for one of these angry utterances to be imprisoned three years in the [[Vaxholm Castle]] on the charge of [[Lèse-majesté]], culminating in the [[Rabulist riots]]. He continued his literary labours until his death in 1865. Few Swedish writers have wielded so pure and so incisive a style as Crusenstolpe, but his historical work is vitiated by political and personal bias.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=552}}

==Works==
Crusenstolpe's first important work was a ''History of the Early Years of the Life of King Gustavus IV Adolphus'' (1837),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=552}}{{sfn|Yust|1956|p=799}} which was followed by a series of monographs and by some politico-historical novels, of which ''The House of Holstein-Gottorp in Sweden'' is considered the best,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=552}} the 5th volume of which was published in 1844.{{sfn|NQR staff|1844|p=342}}

The '''Malayalam calendar''' or '''Kollam Era''', also known as ''Kollavarsham'', is a [[Solar calendar|solar]] and [[Sidereal time|sidereal]] [[Hindu calendar]] used in the [[Malabar Coast]] of [[Kerala]] and the Tirunelveli District of Tamil Nadu in India. The origin of the calendar has been dated as 825 CE (Pothu Varsham) at [[Kollam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/data1/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b5f_93.pdf |title=Kollam Era |publisher=Indian Journal History of Science |accessdate=30 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527163650/http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/data1/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b5f_93.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Time measurement and calendar construction|author=Broughton Richmond|year=1956|pages=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUlmAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Kerala|author=R.

== History ==
There are multiple conflicting accounts regarding the origins of the Malayalam calendar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historicalleys.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-kollam-calendar-mystery-discussion.html|title=The Kollam Calendar Mystery – A discussion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which are mentioned below:
*The Kollam era is attributed to the legend of the hero Paraśurāma, an avatar (incarnation) of the god Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/chronology#ref523199|title=Chronology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes divided into cycles of 1,000 years reckoned from 1176 BCE (Before Current Era). Thus, 825 CE (Current Era) would have been the first year of the era’s third millennium. Paraśurāma, was however, a contemporary of Rāma, whose birth date is estimated to be in 5114 BCE (if not earlier).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Lord-Ram-was-born-in-5114-BC/articleshow/273107.cms|title='Lord Ram was born in 5114 BC' - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, unclear if the Paraśurāma associated with the Kollam era is the same as the Paraśurāma of [[Ramayana|Rāmāyana]].
*The news of the physical disappearance of Sri Adi Shankaracharya in 820 CE at Kedarnath reached Kerala only a few years later. It is believed that Kerala began the Malayalam era, also called the Kollam era, in 825 CE in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sringeri.net/2010/05/31/publication/dvd/kalady-the-triumph-of-faith-over-time.htm Kalady: The Triumph of Faith Over Time].

DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaYfoghV-n8|title=Kalady: The Triumph of Faith Over Time (Rediscovery of Sri Adi Shankaracharya's Birth Place)|first=|last=sharadapeetham|date=25 April 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. V. Sarma, [https://www.insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol31_1_6_KVSarma.pdf Kollam Era], Indian Journal of History of Science, 31(1), 1996, pp. 93-100&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, a differing opinion that Sri Adi Shankaracharya was born in 509 BCE and died in 477 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hindu-blog.com/2008/02/year-of-birth-of-adi-shankaracharya-509.html|title=Year of Birth of Adi Shankaracharya – 509 BC, 44 BC, 788 AD|website=www.hindu-blog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The origin of Kollam Era has been dated to 825 CE, when the great convention in Kollam was held at the behest of King Kulashekhara. Kollam was an important town in that period, and the Malayalam Era is called 'Kollavarsham', possibly as a result of the [[Tharisapalli plates]].
* According to [[Hermann Gundert]], Kollavarsham started as part of erecting a new Shiva Temple in Kollam and because of the strictly local and religious background, the other regions did not follow this system at first. Once Kollam port emerged as an important trade center, however, the other countries also started to follow the new system of calendar. This theory backs the remarks of [[Ibn Battuta]] as well.&lt;ref name='ASurveyOfKeralaHistory-104' /&gt;&lt;ref name="kerala.gov.in-ക"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kollam - Short History|url=http://www.kerala.gov.in/statistical/panchayat_statistics2001/klm_shis.htm|work=Statistical Data|publisher=kerala.gov.in|accessdate=8 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121073245/http://www.kerala.gov.in/statistical/panchayat_statistics2001/klm_shis.htm|archivedate=2007-11-21 &lt;!-- 07:32:45 --&gt; |format=Short History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Months==
The Malayalam months follows the Sanskritic Sauramāsa (solar month) naming convention. Thus, Cingam is named after the corresponding Sanskrit solar month, the [[Siṃha|Simham]], and so on. This is unlike the case in Tulu calendar which follow the names of lunar months. The following are the months of the astronomical Malayalam calendar:

Like the months above, there are twenty seven [[nakshatra|stars]] starting from Aswati ([[Ashvini|Ashvinī]] in Sanskrit) and ending in [[Revati (nakshatra)|Revatī]]. The 365 days of the year are divided into groups of fourteen days called ''Ñattuvela'' ({{lang|ml|ഞാറ്റുവേല}}), each one bearing the name of a star.

== Significant dates ==
Vishu ({{lang|ml|വിഷു}}), celebrated on the 1st of Metam, and ''[[Onam]]'' ({{lang|ml|ഓണം}}), celebrated on the star Thiruvonam {{IPA-ml|t̪iruʋoːɳəm|}} in the month of ''Chingam'', are two of the major festivals in Kerala.  In Indian astrology, the passing of the sun into Aries at the vernal equinox on Metam 1, now calculated to fall on April 14, is generally celebrated as Vishu (derived from the Sanskrit ''Maha Vishuva Sankranti'', the word "sanGkrAnti" सङ्क्रान्ति meaning "transference or transition to"), and was considered a candidate for marking the start of a year.&lt;ref name="boloji.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&amp;sd=Articles&amp;ArticleID=16400|title=Boloji.com - A Study in Diversity - News, Views, Analysis, Literature, Poetry, Features - Express Yourself|website=www.boloji.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a conference of astronomers that the king Udaya Marthanda Varma summoned in 825 CE, resolved to start the New Year on the first of Chingam (in mid-August). While Cochin, Madurai, Tirunelveli and Ceylon followed suit,&lt;ref name="boloji.com"/&gt; Palghat and North Kerala retained another ancient mode of reckoning the New Year from the first day of Kanni (Virgo) in September.

The [[Makaravilakku]] festival is celebrated in the [[Ayyappan|Ayyappa]] Temple at [[Sabarimala]] on the 1st day of month ''Makaram''. This marks the grand finale of the two-month period to the Sabarimala pilgrimage. The 1st of ''Makaram'' marks the Winter Solstice (Uttarayanam) and the 1st of ''Karkaṭakam'' marks the summer solstice (Dakshinayanam) according to the Malayalam calendar. (According to the astronomical calendar the summer solstice is on June 21, and the winter solstice on December 21.)

Chaitram 1 (usually coinciding with March 20) or Metam 1 (usually coinciding with April 14), both in the proximity of the date of the vernal equinox (March 21), mark the beginning of the new year in many traditional Indian calendars such as the [[Indian_national_calendar|Indian National calendar]] and the [[Tamil calendar]]. When the Government of Kerala adopted Kolla Varsham as the regional calendar, the 1st of ''Chingam'', the month of the festival of Onam, was accepted as the Malayalam New Year instead.

==Derived names==
Many events in Kerala are related to the dates in the Malayalam calendar.

The agricultural activities of Kerala are centred on the seasons. The southwest [[monsoon]] which starts around 1 June is known as ''Etavappathi'', meaning mid-Etavam. The northeast monsoon which starts during mid October is called ''thulavarsham'' (rain in the month of ''thulam''). The two harvests of paddy are called ''Kannikkoythu'' and ''Makarakkoythu'' (harvests in the months ''kanni'' and ''makaram'') respectively.

The '''''mušḫuššu''''' ({{lang|sux|{{cuneiform|𒈲𒄭𒄊}}}}; formerly also read as ''sirrušu'', ''sirrush'') is a creature from [[ancient Mesopotamian religion|ancient Mesopotamian mythology]]. A [[mythological hybrid]], it is a scaly [[dragon]] with hind legs resembling the talons of an [[eagle]], [[felidae|feline]] fore legs, a long neck and tail, a horned head, a snake-like tongue, and a crest. The mušḫuššu most famously appears on the reconstructed [[Ishtar Gate]] of the city of [[Babylon]], dating to the sixth century BC.

The form {{lang|akk-Latn|mušḫuššu}} is the  [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] nominative of the Sumerian  {{lang|sux|{{cuneiform|𒈲𒄭𒄊}} MUŠ.ḪUS}},  "reddish snake",  sometimes also translated as "fierce snake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?searchword=l=muc-huc%20p=N%20a=type@of@serpent&amp;charenc=gcirc&amp;sortorder=textno |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |publisher=Etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One author,&lt;ref name=costello&gt;{{cite book|last1=Costello|first1=Peter|title=In Search of Lake Monsters|date=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly following others, translates it as "splendor serpent" ({{lang|sux|{{cuneiform|𒈲}} MUŠ}} is the Sumerian term for "serpent". The reading ''sir-ruššu'' is due to a mistransliteration in early Assyriology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Oppenheim |editor-first1=A.

==History==
[[Image:Pergamonmuseum Ishtartor 05.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of the [[Ishtar Gate]] at Pergamon Museum in Berlin]]

The ''mušḫuššu'' is the sacred animal of [[Marduk]] and his son [[Nabu]] during the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. It was taken over by Marduk from [[Tishpak]], the local god of [[Eshnunna]].&lt;ref name="BienkowskiMillard2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bienkowski|first1=Piotr|last2=Millard|first2=Alan Ralph|title=Dictionary of the Ancient Near East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KdlhaAfK1sYC&amp;pg=PA189|year=2000|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-3557-9|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[constellation Hydra]] was known in Babylonian astronomical texts as [[Bašmu]], "the Serpent" ({{cuneiform|{{linktext|𒀯|𒈲}}}}, &lt;sup&gt;MUL.d&lt;/sup&gt;MUŠ). It was depicted as having the torso of a fish, a tail of a snake, the fore paws of a lion, the hind legs of an eagle, with wings, and with a head comparable to the ''mušḫuššu'' dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiggerman |first=F.A.M. |editor-last1=Finkel |editor-first1=I.

The '''nebular hypothesis''' is the most widely accepted model in the field of [[cosmogony]] to explain the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]] (as well as other [[planetary system]]s). It suggests that the Solar System is formed from the nebulous material. The theory was developed by [[Immanuel Kant]] and published in his ''[[Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels]]'' ("Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens"), published in 1755. Originally applied to the [[Solar System]], the process of planetary system formation is now thought to be at work throughout the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006 /&gt; The widely accepted modern variant of the nebular hypothesis is the '''solar nebular disk model''' ('''SNDM''') or '''solar nebular model'''.&lt;ref name=Woolfson1993 /&gt; It offered explanations for a variety of properties of the Solar System, including the nearly circular and coplanar orbits of the planets, and their motion in the same direction as the Sun's rotation. Some elements of the original nebular hypothesis are echoed in modern theories of planetary formation, but most elements have been superseded.

According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form in massive and dense clouds of [[molecular hydrogen]]—[[giant molecular cloud]]s (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation is a complex process, which always produces a gaseous [[protoplanetary disk]], [[proplyd]], around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems is thought to be a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1&amp;nbsp;million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next&amp;nbsp;10–100 million years.&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006 /&gt;

The protoplanetary disk is an [[accretion disk]] that feeds the central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools in what is known as the [[T Tauri star]] stage; here, formation of small [[dust]] grains made of [[rock (geology)|rocks]] and ice is possible. The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized [[planetesimal]]s. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000&amp;nbsp;years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized [[planetary embryo]]s. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few [[terrestrial planet]]s. The last stage takes approximately 100&amp;nbsp;million to a billion years.&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006 /&gt;

The formation of [[giant planet]]s is a more complicated process. It is thought to occur beyond the [[Frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], where planetary embryos mainly are made of various types of ice. As a result, they are several times more massive than in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk. What follows after the embryo formation is not completely clear. Some embryos appear to continue to grow and eventually reach 5–10 [[Earth mass]]es—the threshold value, which is necessary to begin accretion of the [[hydrogen]]–[[helium]] gas from the disk. The accumulation of gas by the core is initially a slow process, which continues for several million years, but after the forming protoplanet reaches about 30 Earth masses ({{Earth mass|link=y}}) it accelerates and proceeds in a runaway manner. [[Jupiter]]- and [[Saturn]]-like planets are thought to accumulate the bulk of their mass during only 10,000&amp;nbsp;years. The accretion stops when the gas is exhausted. The formed planets can migrate over long distances during or after their formation. [[Ice giant]]s such as [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] are thought to be failed cores, which formed too late when the disk had almost disappeared.&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006 /&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of Solar System formation and evolution hypotheses}}
There is evidence that [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] first proposed parts of the nebular hypothesis in 1734.&lt;ref name=Swedenborg1734&gt;{{cite book |last= Swedenborg |first= Emanuel |date= 1734|title= (Principia) Latin: Opera Philosophica et Mineralia (English: Philosophical and Mineralogical Works)|volume= I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Httpwwwnewchurchhistoryorgarticlesglbbakerpdf"&gt;http://www.newchurchhistory.org/articles/glb2007/baker.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]], familiar with Swedenborg's work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own ''Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens'', wherein he argued that gaseous clouds ([[nebulae]]) slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten due to [[gravity]], eventually forming [[star]]s and [[planet]]s.&lt;ref name=Woolfson1993&gt;{{cite journal|last= Woolfson|first= M.M.|title= Solar System&amp;nbsp;– its origin and evolution|journal= Q. J. R. Astron. Soc.|volume= 34| pages= 1–20|date= 1993|bibcode= 1993QJRAS..34....1W}} For details of Kant's position, see Stephen Palmquist, "Kant's Cosmogony Re-Evaluated", ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'' 18:3 (September 1987), pp.255-269.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] independently developed and proposed a similar model in 1796&lt;ref name=Woolfson1993 /&gt; in his ''Exposition du systeme du monde''. He envisioned that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout the volume of the Solar System. His theory featured a contracting and cooling protosolar cloud—the protosolar nebula. As this cooled and contracted, it flattened and spun more rapidly, throwing off (or shedding) a series of gaseous rings of material; and according to him, the planets condensed from this material. His model was similar to Kant's, except more detailed and on a smaller scale.&lt;ref name=Woolfson1993 /&gt; While the Laplacian nebular model dominated in the 19th century, it encountered a number of difficulties. The main problem involved [[angular momentum]] distribution between the Sun and planets. The planets have 99% of the angular momentum, and this fact could not be explained by the nebular model.&lt;ref name=Woolfson1993 /&gt; As a result, astronomers largely abandoned this theory of planet formation at the beginning of the 20th century.

A major critique came during the 19th century from [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1831-1879), who maintained that ''different rotation between the inner and outer parts of a ring'' could not allow condensation of material.&lt;ref&gt;George H. A. Cole (2013). Planetary Science: The Science of Planets around Stars, Second Edition, Michael M. Woolfson, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Sir David Brewster]] also rejected Laplace, writing in 1876 that "those who believe in the Nebular Theory consider it as certain that our Earth derived its solid matter and its atmosphere from a ring thrown from the Solar atmosphere, which afterwards contracted into a solid terraqueous sphere, from which the Moon was thrown off by the same process". He argued that under such view, "the Moon must necessarily have carried off water and air from the watery and aerial parts of the Earth and must have an atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;Brester, David (1876), "More Worlds Than One: The Creed of the Philosopher and the Hope of the Christian", Chatto and Windus, Piccadilly, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Brewster claimed that [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s religious beliefs had previously considered nebular ideas as tending to atheism, and quoted him as saying that "the growth of new systems out of old ones, without the mediation of a Divine power, seemed to him apparently absurd".&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by David Brewster, "More worlds than one : the creed of the philosopher and the hope of the Christian", Fixed stars and binary systems. p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived deficiencies of the Laplacian model stimulated scientists to find a replacement for it. During the 20th century many theories addressed the issue, including the ''planetesimal theory'' of [[Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin|Thomas Chamberlin]] and [[Forest Ray Moulton|Forest Moulton]] (1901), the ''tidal model'' of [[James Jeans]] (1917), the ''accretion model'' of [[Otto Schmidt]] (1944), the ''protoplanet theory'' of [[William McCrea (astronomer)|William McCrea]] (1960) and finally the ''capture theory'' of [[Michael Woolfson]].&lt;ref name=Woolfson1993 /&gt; In 1978 [[Andrew Prentice]] resurrected the initial Laplacian ideas about planet formation and developed the ''modern Laplacian theory''.&lt;ref name=Woolfson1993 /&gt; None of these attempts proved completely successful, and many of the proposed theories were descriptive.

The birth of the modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation—the solar nebular disk model (SNDM)—can be traced to the Soviet astronomer [[Victor Safronov]].&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite web |last= Henbest |first= Nigel |url= https://www.newscientist.com/channel/solar-system/comets-asteroids/mg13117837.100|title= Birth of the planets: The Earth and its fellow planets may be survivors from a time when planets ricocheted around the Sun like ball bearings on a pinball table|publisher= New Scientist|date= 1991|accessdate= 2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1969 book ''Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets'',&lt;ref name=Safronov1972&gt;{{cite book |first= Viktor Sergeevich|last= Safronov|title= Evolution of the Protoplanetary Cloud and Formation of the Earth and the Planets|isbn= 0-7065-1225-1|date= 1972| publisher=Israel Program for Scientific Translations}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated to English in 1972, had a long-lasting effect on the way scientists think about the formation of the planets.&lt;ref name=Safronov&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wetherill |first= George W. |bibcode= 1989Metic..24..347W|title= Leonard Medal Citation for Victor Sergeevich Safronov|journal= Meteoritics|date= 1989|volume= 24|issue= 4 |page= 347|doi= 10.1111/j.1945-5100.1989.tb00700.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved. Safronov's ideas were further developed in the works of [[George Wetherill]], who discovered ''[[Accretion (astrophysics)#Runaway accretion|runaway accretion]]''.&lt;ref name=Woolfson1993 /&gt; While originally applied only to the [[Solar System]], the SNDM was subsequently thought by theorists to be at work throughout the Universe; as of {{Extrasolar planet counts|asof}} astronomers have discovered {{Extrasolar planet counts|planet_count}} [[extrasolar planet]]s in our [[galaxy]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;

The star formation process naturally results in the appearance of [[accretion disk]]s around young stellar objects.&lt;ref name=Andre1994 /&gt; At the age of about 1&amp;nbsp;million years, 100% of stars may have such disks.&lt;ref name=Haisch2001 /&gt; This conclusion is supported by the discovery of the gaseous and dusty disks around [[protostar]]s and [[T Tauri star]]s as well as by theoretical considerations.&lt;ref name=Padgett1999 /&gt; Observations of these disks show that the [[dust]] grains inside them grow in size on short (thousand-year) time scales, producing 1&amp;nbsp;centimeter sized particles.&lt;ref name=Kessler-Silacci2006 /&gt;

The accretion process, by which 1&amp;nbsp;km [[planetesimal]]s grow into 1,000&amp;nbsp;km sized bodies, is well understood now.&lt;ref name=Kokubo2002 /&gt; This process develops inside any disk where the number density of planetesimals is sufficiently high, and proceeds in a runaway manner. Growth later slows and continues as oligarchic accretion. The end result is formation of [[planetary embryo]]s of varying sizes, which depend on the distance from the star.&lt;ref name=Kokubo2002 /&gt; Various simulations have demonstrated that the merger of embryos in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk leads to the formation of a few Earth-sized bodies. Thus the origin of [[terrestrial planet]]s is now considered to be an almost solved problem.&lt;ref name=Raymond2006 /&gt;

=== Current issues ===
The physics of accretion disks encounters some problems.&lt;ref name=Wurchterl2004 /&gt; The most important one is how the material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its [[angular momentum]]. One possible explanation suggested by [[Hannes Alfvén]] was that angular momentum was shed by the solar wind during its [[T Tauri star]] phase. The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses.&lt;ref name=lynden-bell_1974&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynden-Bell|first=D.|author2=Pringle, J. E.|title=The evolution of viscous discs and the origin of the nebular variables|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=1974|volume=168|issue=3|pages=603–637|doi=10.1093/mnras/168.3.603|bibcode = 1974MNRAS.168..603L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding angular momentum is [[magnetic braking]], where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Devitt |title=What Puts The Brakes On Madly Spinning Stars? |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison |date=January 31, 2001 |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/5732 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main processes responsible for the disappearance of the gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.&lt;ref name=dullemond_2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dullemond|first1=C.|last2=Hollenbach|first2=D.|last3=Kamp|first3=I.|last4=D'Alessio|first4=P.|editor1-last=Reipurth|editor1-first=B.|editor2-last=Jewitt|editor2-first=D.|editor3-last=Keil|editor3-first=K.|title=Protostars and Planets V|date=2007|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson, AZ|isbn=978-0816526543|pages=555–572|arxiv=astro-ph/0602619|chapter=Models of the Structure and Evolution of Protoplanetary Disks|bibcode = 2007prpl.conf..555D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clarke_2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=C.|editor1-last=Garcia|editor1-first=P.|title=Physical Processes in Circumstellar Disks around Young Stars|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=9780226282282|pages=355–418|chapter=The Dispersal of Disks around Young Stars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of planetesimals is the biggest unsolved problem in the nebular disk model. How 1&amp;nbsp;cm sized particles coalesce into 1&amp;nbsp;km planetesimals is a mystery. This mechanism appears to be the key to the question as to why some stars have planets, while others have nothing around them, not even [[debris disk|dust belts]].&lt;ref name=Youdin2002 /&gt;

The formation timescale of [[giant planet]]s is also an important problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk.&lt;ref name=Kokubo2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Inaba2003 /&gt; The mean lifetime of the disks, which is less than ten million (10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation.&lt;ref name=Haisch2001 /&gt; Much progress has been done to solve this problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming [[Jupiter]] (or more massive planets) in about 4 million years or less, well within the average lifetime of gaseous disks.&lt;ref name=lhdb2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lissauer|first=J.

Another potential problem of giant planet formation is their [[Planetary migration|orbital migration]]. Some calculations show that interaction with the disk can cause rapid inward migration, which, if not stopped, results in the planet reaching the "central regions still as a sub-Jovian object."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Papaloizou2007|Papaloizou 2007]] page 10&lt;/ref&gt; More recent calculations indicate that disk evolution during migration can mitigate this problem.&lt;ref name=ddl2011&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Angelo|first=G.|author2=Durisen, R.

Another possible mechanism for the formation of planetesimals is the [[streaming instability]] in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.&lt;ref name=Johansen_Jacquet_2015&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johansen |first1=A. |last2=Jacquet |first2=E. |last3=Cuzzi |first3=J.

Because planetesimals are so numerous, and spread throughout the protoplanetary disk, some survive the formation of a planetary system. [[Asteroid]]s are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide a great deal of information about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal [[Planetary differentiation|differentiation]] took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.&lt;ref name=Bottke2005 /&gt;

=== Rocky planets ===
According to the solar nebular disk model, [[rocky planet]]s form in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within the [[frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], where the temperature is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains.&lt;ref name=Raymond2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raymond|first=Sean N.|author2=Quinn, Thomas |author3=Lunine, Jonathan I. |title=High-resolution simulations of the final assembly of Earth-like planets 2: water delivery and planetary habitability|journal=Astrobiology|volume=7|pages=66–84|date=2007|doi=10.1089/ast.2006.06-0126|bibcode=2007AsBio...7...66R|pmid=17407404|issue=1|arxiv = astro-ph/0510285}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in coagulation of purely rocky grains and later in the formation of rocky planetesimals.{{Refn|group=lower-alpha|The [[planetesimal]]s near the outer edge of the terrestrial planet region—2.5 to 4&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun—may accumulate some amount of ice.

The next stage is called ''oligarchic accretion''.&lt;ref name=Kokubo2002 /&gt; It is characterized by the dominance of several hundred of the largest bodies—oligarchs, which continue to slowly accrete planetesimals.&lt;ref name=Kokubo2002 /&gt; No body other than the oligarchs can grow.&lt;ref name=Thommes2003 /&gt; At this stage the rate of accretion is proportional to R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is derived from the geometrical [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of an oligarch.&lt;ref name=Thommes2003 /&gt; The specific accretion rate is proportional to {{nowrap|M&lt;sup&gt;−1/3&lt;/sup&gt;}}; and it declines with the mass of the body.

The oligarchs continue to accrete until planetesimals are exhausted in the disk around them.&lt;ref name=Kokubo2002 /&gt; Sometimes nearby oligarchs merge. The final mass of an oligarch depends on the distance from the star and surface density of planetesimals and is called the isolation mass.&lt;ref name=Thommes2003 /&gt; For the rocky planets it is up to {{Earth mass|0.1}}, or one [[Mars]] mass.&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006 /&gt; The final result of the oligarchic stage is the formation of about 100 [[Moon]]- to Mars-sized planetary embryos uniformly spaced at about {{nowrap|10·H&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Raymond2006 /&gt; They are thought to reside inside gaps in the disk and to be separated by rings of remaining planetesimals. This stage is thought to last a few hundred thousand years.&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kokubo2002 /&gt;

The last stage of rocky planet formation is the ''merger stage''.&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006 /&gt; It begins when only a small number of planetesimals remains and embryos become massive enough to perturb each other, which causes their orbits to become [[Chaos theory|chaotic]].&lt;ref name=Raymond2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raymond|first=Sean N.|author2=Quinn, Thomas |author3=Lunine, Jonathan I. |title=High-resolution simulations of the final assembly of earth-like planets 1: terrestrial accretion and dynamics|journal=Icarus|volume=183|issue=2|pages=265–282|date=2006| doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.03.011|bibcode=2006Icar..183..265R|arxiv = astro-ph/0510284}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage embryos expel remaining planetesimals, and collide with each other.

The formation of [[giant planet]]s is an outstanding problem in the [[planetary science]]s.&lt;ref name=Wurchterl2004 /&gt; In the framework of the solar nebular model two theories for their formation exist.

Giant planets can significantly influence [[terrestrial planet]] formation.

===Exoplanets===

Thousands of exoplanets have been identified in the last twenty years. The orbits of many of these planets and systems of planets differ significantly from the planets in the Solar System. The exoplanets discovered include hot-Jupiters, warm-Jupiters, super-Earths, and systems of tightly packed inner planets.

The hot-Jupiters and warm-Jupiters are thought to have migrated to their current orbits during or following their formation. A number of possible mechanisms for this migration have been proposed. Type I or Type II migration could smoothly decrease the semimajor axis of the planet's orbit resulting in a warm- or hot-Jupiter. Gravitational scattering by other planets onto eccentric orbits with a perihelion near the star followed by the circularization of its orbit due to tidal interactions with the star can leave a planet on a close orbit. If a massive companion planet or star on an inclined orbit was present an exchange of inclination for eccentricity via the Kozai mechanism raising eccentricities and lowering perihelion followed by circularization can also result in a close orbit. Many of the Jupiter-sized planets have eccentric orbits which may indicate that gravitational encounters occurred between the planets, although migration while in resonance can also excite eccentricities.&lt;ref name="Baruteau_etal_2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baruteau|first1=C.|last2=Crida|first2=A.|last3=Paardekooper|first3=S.-J.|last4=Masset|first4=F.|last5=Guilet|first5=J.|last6=Bitsch|first6=B.|last7=Nelson|first7=R.|last8=Kley|first8=W.|last9=Papaloizou|first9=J.|title=Protostars and Planets VI, Chapter: Planet-Disk Interactions and Early Evolution of Planetary Systems|date=2014|publisher=University of Arizona Press|pages=667–689|arxiv=1312.4293|bibcode=2014prpl.conf..667B|doi=10.2458/azu_uapress_9780816531240-ch029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The in situ growth of hot Jupiters from closely orbiting super Earths has also been proposed. The cores in this hypothesis could have formed locally or at a greater distance and migrated close to the star.&lt;ref name="Batygin_etal_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Batygin|first1=Konstantin|last2=Bodenheimer|first2=Peter H.|last3=Laughlin|first3=Gregory P.|title=In Situ Formation and Dynamical Evolution of Hot Jupiter Systems|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2016|volume=829|issue=2|page=114|doi=10.3847/0004-637X/829/2/114|arxiv=1511.09157|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/829/2/114/meta|bibcode = 2016ApJ...829..114B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Super-Earths and other closely orbiting planets are thought to have either formed in situ or to have migrated inward from their initial locations. The in situ formation of closely orbiting super-Earths would require a massive disk, the migration of planetary embryos followed by collisions and mergers, or the radial drift of small solids from farther out in the disk. The migration of the super-Earths, or the embryos that collided to form them, is likely to have been Type I due to their smaller mass. The resonant orbits of some of the exoplanet systems indicates that some migration occurred in these systems, while the spacing of the orbits in many of the other systems not in resonance indicates that an instability likely occurred in those systems after the dissipation of the gas disk. The absence of Super-Earths and closely orbiting planets in the Solar System may be due to the previous formation of Jupiter blocking their inward migration.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli_Raymond_2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Morbidelli |first1= Alessandro |last2= Raymond |first2= Sean |title= Challenges in planet formation |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |date=2016 |volume= 121 |issue=10 |pages= 1962–1980 |doi= 10.1002/2016JE005088 |arxiv= 1610.07202 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JE005088/abstract|bibcode = 2016JGRE..121.1962M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of gas a super-Earth that formed in situ acquires may depend on when the planetary embryos merged due to giant impacts relative to the dissipation of the gas disk. If the mergers happen after the gas disk dissipates terrestrial planets can form, if in a transition disk a super-Earth with a gas envelope containing a few percent of its mass may form. If the mergers happen too early runaway gas accretion may occur leading to the formation of a gas giant. The mergers begin when the dynamical friction due to the gas disk becomes insufficient to prevent collisions, a process that will begin earlier in a higher metallicity disk.&lt;ref name="Lee_Chiang_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Eve J.|last2=Chiang|first2=Eugene|title=Breeding Super-Earths and Birthing Super-puffs in Transitional Disks|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2016|volume=817|issue=2|page=90|doi=10.3847/0004-637X/817/2/90|arxiv=1510.08855|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/817/2/90/meta|bibcode = 2016ApJ...817...90L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively gas accretion may be limited due to the envelopes not being in hydrostatic equilibrium, instead gas may flow through the envelope slowing its growth and delaying the onset of runaway gas accretion until the mass of the core reaches 15 Earth masses.&lt;ref name="Lambrechts_Lega"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lambrechts|first1=Michiel|last2=Lega|first2=Elana|title=Reduced gas accretion on super-Earths and ice giants|date=2017|arxiv=1708.00767|bibcode = 2017A&amp;A...606A.146L |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201731014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning of ''accretion'' ==
Use of the term "[[accretion disk]]" for the [[protoplanetary disk]] leads to confusion over the [[planetary accretion]] process.
The protoplanetary disk is sometimes referred to as an accretion disk, because while the young [[T Tauri star|T Tauri]]-like protostar is still contracting, gaseous material may still be falling onto it, accreting on its surface from the disk's inner edge.&lt;ref name=Yorke1999 /&gt; In an accretion disk, there is a net flux of mass from larger radii toward smaller radii.&lt;ref name=lynden-bell_1974 /&gt;

However, that meaning should not be confused with the process of accretion forming the planets. In this context, accretion refers to the process of cooled, solidified grains of dust and ice orbiting the [[protostar]] in the protoplanetary disk, colliding and sticking together and gradually growing, up to and including the high-energy collisions between sizable [[planetesimal]]s.&lt;ref name=Kokubo2002 /&gt;

In addition, the [[giant planet]]s probably had accretion disks of their own, in the first meaning of the word.&lt;ref name=dangelo_podolak_2015&gt;{{cite journal |last=D'Angelo |first=G. |author2= Podolak, M. |title= Capture and Evolution of Planetesimals in Circumjovian Disks |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |date= 2015 |volume=806 |issue=1 |pages=29pp |doi= 10.1088/0004-637X/806/2/203|arxiv = 1504.04364 |bibcode = 2015ApJ...806..203D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clouds of captured hydrogen and helium gas contracted, spun up, flattened, and deposited gas onto the surface of each giant [[protoplanet]], while solid bodies within that disk accreted into the giant planet's regular moons.&lt;ref name=Canup2002&gt;{{cite journal |last=Canup |first=Robin M. |author2= Ward, William R. |title= Formation of the Galilean Satellites: Conditions of Accretion |journal= The Astronomical Journal |date=2002 |volume=124 |issue=6 |pages=3404–3423 |doi= 10.1086/344684 |url= http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~robin/cw02final.pdf |format= PDF |bibcode= 2002AJ....124.3404C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nikolai Alexandrovich Mashkin''' (9 February 1900, Sokolki – 15 September 1950, [[Moscow]]) was a [[Soviet]] scholar of [[Roman history]] (Doctor of Historical Sciences and Professor from 1942). Mashkin authored ''The History of Ancient Rome'' (1947–56), which was translated into several languages, and ''The Principate of [[Augustus]]. Its Origin and Social Essence'' (1949, translated into German, Italian, Hungarian and Romanian languages). In 1950 Mashkin received the [[State Prize of the USSR]].&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/sie/10656/%D0%9C%D0%90%D0%A8%D0%9A%D0%98%D0%9D| script-title=ru:Машкин |publisher =Dic.academic.ru| work=Советская историческая энциклопедия|language=Russian|accessdate =24 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mashkin was born in the village of Sokolki, present [[Bugulminsky District]] in Russia. Having finished a school in Bugulma, he studied at the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the [[Samara State University]] (1921/22) and at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the [[Moscow University]].&lt;ref name="brill"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly-supplements-i-6/mashkin-nikolai-alexandrovich-COM_00462?s.num=0&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.brill-s-new-pauly-supplements-i-6&amp;s.q=Mashkin| title =Mashkin, Nikolai Alexandrovich|author=Heinen, Heinz|publisher = Brill’s New Pauly Supplements I - Volume 6 : History of classical Scholarship - A Biographical Dictionary| accessdate =24 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 Mashkin received his doctorate.&lt;ref name="brill"/&gt; Mashkin extensively studied the history of [[Roman provinces]], particularly [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].&lt;ref name="dic"/&gt; He also authored several works on [[circumcellions]].

The '''Northumbrian Renaissance''' or '''Northumbria's Golden Age''' is the name given to a period of cultural flowering in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Northumbria]], broadly speaking from the mid-seventh to the mid-eighth centuries. It is characterised by a blend of [[insular art]], [[Germanic art]] and [[Mediterranean]] influence. Authors associated with this golden age include [[Bede]] and [[Alcuin]]; artefacts include the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and associated manuscripts, the [[Ruthwell Cross]] and associated sculptures, and, arguably, the [[Franks Casket]]. An illustration of the cultural activity of Northumbria during this period is given by Alcuin's ''De Sanctis et Pontificibus Ecclesiæ Eboracensis'', which gives particular attention to Bishop [[Æthelbert of York]].

'''Rosslyn Chapel''', formally known as the '''Collegiate Chapel of St Matthew''', is a 15th-century chapel located in the village of [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]], [[Midlothian]], Scotland.

Rosslyn Chapel was founded on a small hill above Roslin Glen as a [[Catholic]] collegiate church (with between four and six ordained canons and two boy choristers) in the mid-15th century. The chapel was founded by [[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness]]  of the  [[Scoto-Norman]] [[Sinclair family]]. Rosslyn Chapel is the third [[Clan Sinclair|Sinclair]] place of worship at Roslin, the first being in [[Roslin Castle]] and the second (whose crumbling buttresses can still be seen today) in what is now Roslin Cemetery.&lt;ref name="MT"&gt;Turnbull, Michael, 'Rosslyn Chapel Revealed' (Sutton Publishing Ltd., November 2007) {{ISBN|0-7509-4467-6}} {{ISBN|978-0750944670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinclair founded the college to celebrate the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] throughout the day and night, and also to celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]es for all the faithful departed, including the deceased members of the Sinclair family. During this period, the rich heritage of plainsong (a single melodic line) or polyphony (vocal harmony) were used to enrich the singing of the liturgy. Sinclair provided an endowment to pay for the support of the priests and choristers in perpetuity. The priests also had parochial responsibilities.

After the [[Scottish Reformation]] (1560), Roman Catholic worship in the chapel was brought to an end. The Sinclair family continued to be Roman Catholics until the early 18th century. From that time, the chapel was closed to public worship until 1861. It was re-opened as a place of worship according to the rites of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], a member church of the [[Anglican Communion]].

It was reported in ''The Argus'' of Melbourne, Australia that Rosslyn Chapel was the site of an alleged bombing attempt by a suffragette.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10796319|title=SUFFRAGETTE VANDAL - Bomb in Rosslyn Chapel. Beauty of Edifice Unmarred. LONDON, July 14. - The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957) - 15 Jul 1914|website=Trove|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1980s, the chapel has been the subject of speculative theories concerning a connection with the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Holy Grail]], and [[Freemasonry]]. It was prominently featured in this role in [[Dan Brown]]'s bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' (2003) and its [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|2006 film adaptation]]. Medieval historians say these accounts have no basis in fact.

Rosslyn Chapel remains privately owned. The current owner is [[Peter St Clair-Erskine, 7th Earl of Rosslyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosslynchapel.org.uk/p/about-I1633 |title=About Rosslyn Chapel |publisher=RosslynChapel.org.uk |accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Keystone rosslyn.jpg|thumb|right|Pendant [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] in the roof]]
The original plans for Rosslyn have never been found or recorded, so it is open to speculation whether or not the chapel was intended to be built in its current layout. Its architecture is considered to be among the finest in Scotland.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunton |first=Larkin |title=The World and Its People |publisher=Silver, Burdett |year=1896 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the chapel began on 20 September 1456, although it has often been recorded as 1446. The confusion over the building date comes from the chapel's receiving its founding charter to build a collegiate chapel in 1446 from Rome. Sinclair did not start to build the chapel until he had built houses for his craftsmen.

Although the original building was to be [[cruciform]], it was never completed. Only the choir was constructed, with the retro-chapel, otherwise called the [[Lady chapel]], built on the much earlier [[crypt]] (Lower Chapel) believed to form part of an earlier castle. The foundations of the unbuilt [[nave]] and [[transept]]s stretching to a distance of 90 feet were recorded in the 19th century. The decorative carving was executed over a forty-year period. After the founder's death, construction of the planned nave and transepts was abandoned - either from lack of funds, lack of interest or a change in liturgical fashion.

The Lower Chapel (also known as the crypt or [[sacristy]]) should not be confused with the [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vaults]] that lie underneath Rosslyn Chapel.&lt;ref name="MT"/&gt;

The chapel stands on fourteen pillars, which form an arcade of twelve pointed arches on three sides of the nave. At the east end, a fourteenth pillar between the penultimate pair form a three-pillared division between the nave and the Lady chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace-Murphy, Tim; Hopkins, Marilyn. ''Rosslyn: Guardians of the Secrets of the Holy Grail'', Element Books, 1999, p. 8,  {{ISBN|1-86204-493-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The three pillars at the east end of the chapel are named, from north to south: the Master Pillar, the Journeyman Pillar and, most famously, the Apprentice Pillar. These names for the pillars date from the late [[Georgian era|Georgian period]] — prior to this period they were called the Earl's Pillar, the [[Shekhinah|Shekinah]] and the Prince's Pillar.

===Apprentice pillar===
[[File:RoslinChapelAppColJM.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Apprentice Pillar]]
One of the more notable architectural features of the Chapel is the "Apprentice Pillar, or "Prentice Pillar".  Originally called the "Prince's Pillar" (in the 1778 document ''An Account of the Chapel of Roslin'')&lt;ref&gt;Forbes , Robert An Account of the Chapel of Roslin. (reprint ed. Cooper, Robert L. D., Grand Lodge of Scotland, 2000. {{ISBN|0-902324-61-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; the name morphed over time due to a legend dating from the 18th century, involving the master mason in charge of the stonework in the chapel and his young apprentice mason. According to the legend, the master mason did not believe that the apprentice could perform the complicated task of carving the column without seeing the original which formed the inspiration for the design.

The master mason travelled to see the original himself, but upon his return was enraged to find that the upstart apprentice had completed the column by himself. In a fit of jealous anger, the master mason took his mallet and struck the apprentice on the head, killing him. The legend concludes that as punishment for his crime, the master mason's face was carved into the opposite corner to forever gaze upon his apprentice's pillar.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Forbes, Bishop of Caithness, ''An Account of the Chapel of Rosslyn'', 1774; cited in ''Rosslyn Chapel'' (1997) by the Earl of Rosslyn, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[architrave]] joining the pillar there is an inscription, ''Forte est vinum fortior est rex fortiores sunt mulieres super omnia vincit veritas'': "Wine is strong, a king is stronger, women are stronger still, but truth conquers all" ([[1 Esdras]], chapters 3 &amp; 4).

The author Henning Klovekorn has proposed that the pillar is representative of one of the roots of the Nordic [[Yggdrasil]] tree, prominent in [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] and [[Norse mythology]]. He compares the [[dragon]]s at the base of the pillar to the dragons found eating away at the base of the Yggdrasil root and, pointing out that at the top of the pillar is carved tree foliage, argues that the Nordic/Viking association is plausible considering the many auxiliary references in the chapel to Celtic and Norse mythology.&lt;ref name="HK"&gt;Klovekorn, Henning. ''The 99 Degrees of Freemasonry''. Cornerstone, 2007 {{ISBN|1-887560-82-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{undue weight inline|date=May 2014}}
The general form of the pillar has been related to a type described by the French architect [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] as a "bunch of sausages."&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, Ian, ''Scottish Crafts'', Harrap (1948), p.23, "On en voit un (pilier) composé de ''gros boudins'' en spirale dans l'église de Sainte-Croix de [[Provins]]," Viollet-le-Duc, ''Dictionnaire Raisonné de l’Architecture Française du XIe au XVIe siècle''/Pilier&lt;/ref&gt;

A full-size [[plaster cast]] of the Apprentice Pillar and the adjacent bay of the chapel was made in 1871, and is in the [[Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum)|Cast Courts]] of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/network/casts-in-focus-rosslyn-chapel |title=Casts In Focus: Rosslyn Chapel |work=vam.ac.uk |publisher= |accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carvings===
Among Rosslyn's many intricate carvings are a sequence of 213 cubes or "boxes" protruding from pillars and arches with a selection of patterns on them. It is unknown if these patterns have any particular meaning attached to them. Many people have attempted to find information coded into them, but no interpretation has yet proven conclusive. Unfortunately, many of these 'boxes' are not original, having been replaced in the 19th century after erosion damage.

One recent attempt to make sense of the boxes has been to interpret them as a musical score. The motifs on the boxes somewhat resemble geometric patterns seen in the study of [[cymatics]]. The patterns are formed by placing powder upon a flat surface and vibrating the surface at different frequencies. By matching these [[Ernst Chladni|Chladni patterns]] with musical notes corresponding to the same frequencies, the father-and-son team of Thomas and [[Stuart Mitchell]] produced a tune which Stuart calls the ''Rosslyn Motet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosslyn Chapel: The Music of the Cubes |last=Mitchell |first=Thomas |year=2006 |publisher=Diversions Books |location= |isbn=0-9554629-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tune into the Da Vinci coda |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/arts/tune_into_the_da_vinci_coda_1_466446 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=26 April 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rosslyn chapel green men.jpg|thumb|upright|Green Man of the chapel]]
There are more than 110 carvings of "[[Green Man|Green Men]]" in and around the chapel. Green Men are carvings of human faces with greenery all around them, often growing out of their mouths. They are found in all areas of the chapel, with one example in the Lady chapel, between the two middle altars of the east wall.

[[File:Indian corn rosslyn.jpg|thumb|upright|Carvings, which some believe depict Indian corn (maize)]]
Other carvings represent plants, including depictions of wheat, strawberries or lilies.&lt;ref name=RosslynAndTheGrail&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosslyn and the Grail |last1=Oxbrow |first1=Mark |last2=Robertson |first2=Ian |year=2005 |publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]] |location=Edinburgh |isbn=1-84596-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors [[Robert Lomas]] and [[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]] have hypothesized that some carvings in the chapel represent ears of new world corn or [[maize]], a plant which was unknown in Europe at the time of the chapel's construction. Knight and Lomas view these carvings as evidence supporting the idea that [[Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney]], travelled to the Americas well before Columbus.&lt;ref name="THK"&gt;Knight, Christopher; [[Robert Lomas|Lomas, Robert]]. ''The Hiram Key''. Fair Winds Press, 2001 {{ISBN|1-931412-75-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{undue weight inline|date=May 2014}} In their book they discuss meeting with the wife of botanist Adrian. Dyer, and that Dyer's wife told him that Dyer agreed that the image thought to be maize was accurate.&lt;ref name="THK"/&gt; In fact Dyer found only one identifiable plant among the botanical carvings and suggested that the "maize" and "aloe" were stylized wooden patterns, only coincidentally looking like real plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turnbull|first1=Michael TRB|title=Rosslyn Chapel|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/places/rosslynchapel_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 December 2016|date=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crypt===
The chapel has been a burial place for several generations of the Sinclairs; a crypt was once accessible from a descending stair at the rear of the chapel. This crypt has been sealed shut for many years, which may explain the recurrent legends that it is merely a front to a more extensive subterranean vault containing (variously) the mummified head of [[Jesus Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;Laidler, Keith, ''The Head of God – The Lost Treasure of the Templars'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Holy Grail]],&lt;ref&gt;Wallace-Murphy, Tim; Hopkins, Marilyn, ''Rosslyn: Guardian of Secrets of the Holy Grail'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[treasure]] of the [[Knights Templar|Templar]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertlomas.com/Freemason/Origins.html Robert Lomas, ''The Origins of Freemasonry'']&lt;/ref&gt; or the original crown jewels of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Ralls-MacLeod, Karen; Robertson, Ian, ''The Quest for the Celtic Key'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, when the 2nd Earl of Rosslyn died, his wish was to be buried in the original vault. Exhaustive searches over the period of a week were made, but no entrance to the original vault was found and he was buried beside his wife in the Lady Chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson's Guide to Rosslyn Chapel published 1862.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rooftop pinnacle===
The pinnacles on the rooftop have been subject to interest during renovation work in 2010. Nesting jackdaws had made the pinnacles unstable and as such had to be dismantled brick by brick revealing the existence of a chamber specifically made by the stonemasons to harbour bees. The hive, now abandoned, has been sent to local bee keepers to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rosslyn Chapel was haven for bees |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8594724.stm |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration, conservation and tourism==
The chapel's altars were destroyed in 1592,&lt;ref&gt;
In 1590, the Presbytery forbade  George Ramsay, Minister of [[Lasswade]], from burying the wife of [[Oliver St. Clair]] in the chapel. The same St. Clair had been repeatedly asked to destroy the chapel's altars because they were taken to represent "monuments of idolatry".  St. Clair's tenants were forced to attend the [[Lasswade Parish Church]].
In 1592, St. Clair, who had until then refused to destroy the altars, was summoned to appear before the Church of Scotland General Assembly and threatened with excommunication if the altars remained standing after 17 August 1592. On 31 August 1592,  George Ramsay reported that ''the altars of Roslene were haille demolishit''.
John Charles Carrick, ''The Abbey of S. Mary, Newbottle: a memorial of the royal visit, 1907'', G. Lewis &amp; Co., 1908, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and the chapel was abandoned, gradually falling into decay.

In 1842 the chapel, then in a  ruined and overgrown state, was visited by [[Queen Victoria]], who  expressed a desire that it should be preserved. Restoration work was carried out in 1862 by [[David Bryce]] on behalf of [[James Alexander, 3rd Earl of Rosslyn]]. The chapel was re-dedicated on 22 April 1862, and from this time, Sunday services were once again held, now under the jurisdiction of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], for the first time in 270 years.

The Rosslyn Chapel Trust was established in 1995, with the purpose of overseeing its conservation and its opening as a sightseeing destination. The chapel underwent an extensive programme of conservation between 1997 and 2013. This included work to the roof, the stone, the carvings, the stained glass and the organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosslynchapel.org.uk/p/the-chapel-today-I153/ |title=The Chapel Today |work=rosslynchapel.org.uk |publisher= |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A steel canopy was erected over the chapel roof for fourteen years. This was to prevent further rain damage to the church and also to give it a chance to dry out properly. Three human skeletons were found during the restoration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midlothianadvertiser.co.uk/news/local-headlines/rosslyn_chapel_bones_to_be_dated_1_2061151&lt;/ref&gt; Major stonework repairs were completed by the end of 2011. The last major scaffolding was removed in August 2010.&lt;ref name="heritage.scotsman.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rosslyn Chapel's resurrection revealed |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/rosslyn_chapel_s_resurrection_revealed_1_821022 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=12 August 2010 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new visitor centre opened in July 2011. The chapel's stained-glass windows and organ were fully restored. New lighting and heating were installed.&lt;ref name="heritage.scotsman.com"/&gt; The expected cost of the restoration work is around £13 million, with about £3.7 million being spent on the Visitor Centre.  Funding has come from various sources including [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[Historic Scotland]] and the environmental body, WREN.  Actor [[Tom Hanks]] also made a donation.&lt;ref name="heritage.scotsman.com"/&gt;

Photography and video have been forbidden in the chapel since 2008. The chapel sells commercially produced photos in its shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosslynchapel.org.uk/p/faqs-I80/|title=Rosslyn Chapel - FAQs|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, historian Louise Yeoman criticised the Rosslyn Chapel trust for "cashing in" on the popularity of ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', against better knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;"What really upsets me is that they know the Knights Templar connection is false, yet they still perpetuate the myth on their interpretation boards."  {{cite news |title=Historian attacks Rosslyn Chapel for 'cashing in on Da Vinci Code' |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/historian_attacks_rosslyn_chapel_for_cashing_in_on_da_vinci_code_1_1116376 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=3 May 2006 |accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the financial year of 2013-14, Rosslyn Chapel recorded 144,823 visitors, the highest number since 2007-08, when (at the height of popular interest induced by ''The Da Vinci Code''), the number of visitors was close to 159,000.&lt;ref&gt;The trust's financial year ends on 31 March.

==In popular culture==

===Templar and Masonic connections===
The chapel  became the subject of  speculation regarding its supposed connection with the [[Knights Templar]] or [[Freemasonry]] beginning in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' (1982),
Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry Hardcover
John J. Robinson, ''Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry Hardcover'' (1989),
 Michael Baigent  ''The Temple and the Lodge'' (1991),
[[Philip Coppens (author)|Coppens, Philip]]. ''The Stone Puzzle of Rosslyn Chapel''. Frontier Publishing/Adventures Unlimited Press (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; This part of its history was referenced in the [[DC Comics]] storyline ''Batman: Scottish Connection'', in which the hero [[Batman]] becomes caught up in an old vendetta between two Scottish clans during a visit to Scotland, this mystery including the discovery of an ancient treasure trove hidden in Rosslyn.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Scottish Connection'' by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Frank Quitely]], September 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic entered mainstream pop culture with  [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' (2003), reinforced by the subsequent [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film of the same name]] (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hollywood legend Tom Hanks makes donation to Rosslyn Chapel restoration |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-east-fife/hollywood_legend_tom_hanks_makes_donation_to_rosslyn_chapel_restoration_1_1230018 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=6 February 2010 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous books were published after 2003 to cater to the popular interest in supposed connections between Rosslyn Chapel, Freemasonry, the Templars and the [[Holy Grail]] generated by Brown's novel.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g.:
Mark Oxbrow and Ian Robertson,   ''Rosslyn and The Grail''. Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing (2005),
[[Ashley Cowie|]]. ''The Rosslyn Templar''  (2009),
Alan Butler  and John Ritchie, ''Rosslyn Revealed, A Library in Stone'' (2006),
Alan Butler  and John Ritchie,  ''Rosslyn Chapel Decoded: New Interpretations of a Gothic Enigma'' (2013).
&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapel, built 150 years after the dissolution of the Knights Templar, supposedly has many Templar symbols, such as the "Two riders on a single horse" that appear on the [[Knights Templar seals|Seal of the Knights Templar]].
[[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness|William Sinclair]] 3rd Earl of Orkney, Baron of Roslin and 1st Earl of Caithness, claimed by novelists to be a hereditary Grand Master of the Scottish stonemasons, built Rosslyn Chapel.&lt;ref name="secrets"/&gt; A later William Sinclair of Roslin became the first Grand Master of the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]] and, subsequently, several other members of the Sinclair family have held this position.&lt;ref name=NGC&gt;[[National Geographic Channel]]. ''Knights Templar'', 22 February 2006 video documentary. Written by Jesse Evans.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert L. D. Cooper, curator of the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]] Museum and Library, in 2003 published a 12th edition of the 1892 ''Illustrated Guide to Rosslyn Chapel'' with the intention of countering the "nonsense published about Rosslyn Chapel over the last 15 years or so".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://grandlodgescotland.com/masonic-subjects/masonic-subjects/33-rosslyn-chapel/106-illustrated-guide-to-rosslyn-chapel-ac-book-review Book Review]" at the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]] website: "There has been so much nonsense published about Rosslyn Chapel over the last 15 years or so that it is now extremely difficult to know what is nonsense and what is accurate."&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper in 2006 also published ''Rosslyn Hoax?'' in which he actively debunks this type of speculation at length and in great detail. An example is the comparison of the Rosslyn myth of the Apprentice Pillar with that of the ''allegorical'' references to Hiram Abiff in Masonic ritual, and in the process he debunks any similarities between the two. A minute comparison between the Rosslyn Myth and the Masonic allegory can be found in a detailed tabular form in The Rosslyn Hoax?&lt;ref&gt;Robert L D Cooper, ''The Rosslyn Hoax?'', Lewis Masonic 2006, pp.173-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper further debunks other claims of a connection between carvings within Rosslyn Chapel and Scottish Freemasonry. The suggestion that the Apprentice Pillar is a physical reference to the Entered Apprentice degree of Scottish Freemasonry logically led to the conclusion that the other two pillars (in line south to north with the so-called Apprentice Pillar) represented the Fellow of Craft degree (middle pillar) and the Master Mason's degree (north pillar). This association of three pillars in the east part of Rosslyn Chapel with the three degrees of Scottish Freemasonry is impossible, given the fact that (according to Cooper) the third degree of Freemasonry was invented c.1720 - almost 300 years after Rosslyn Chapel was founded.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L D Cooper, ''The Rosslyn Hoax?'', Lewis Masonic 2006, pp.146-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roslyn Chapel, Dalkeith.jpg|right|thumb|upright|An interior view showing the Apprentice Pillar and ornate carvings.]]
The claim that the layout of Rosslyn Chapel echoes that of [[Solomon's Temple]]&lt;ref name=secrets&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind the Da Vinci Code, p. 248|author=Burstein, Dan|publisher=CDS Books|year=2004|isbn=1-59315-022-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been analysed by Mark Oxbrow and Ian Robertson in their book, ''Rosslyn and the Grail'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Rosslyn Chapel bears no more resemblance to Solomon's or Herod's Temple than a house brick does to a paperback book. If you superimpose the floor plans of Rosslyn Chapel and either Solomon's or Herod's Temple, you will actually find that they are not even remotely similar. Writers admit that the chapel is far smaller than either of the temples. They freely scale the plans up or down in an attempt to fit them together. What they actually find are no significant similarities at all. [...] If you superimpose the floor plans of Rosslyn Chapel and the East Quire of [[Glasgow Cathedral]] you will find a startling match: the four walls of both buildings fit precisely. The East Quire of Glasgow is larger than Rosslyn, but the designs of these two mediaeval Scottish buildings are virtually identical. They both have the same number of windows and the same number of pillars in the same configuration. [...] The similarity between Rosslyn Chapel and Glasgow's East Quire is well established. Andrew Kemp noted that 'the entire plan of this Chapel corresponds to a large extent with the choir of Glasgow Cathedral' as far back as 1877 in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries. Many alternative history writers are well aware of this but fail to mention it in their books.&lt;ref name=RosslynAndTheGrail /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As to a possible connection between the St. Clairs and the Knights Templar, the family testified against the Templars when that Order was put on trial in Edinburgh in 1309.&lt;ref name=RosslynAndTheGrail /&gt; Historian Dr. Louise Yeoman, along with other mediaeval scholars, says the Knights Templar connection is false, and points out that Rosslyn Chapel was built by William Sinclair so that Mass could be said for the souls of his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Historian attacks Rosslyn Chapel for 'cashing in on Da Vinci Code' |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/historian_attacks_rosslyn_chapel_for_cashing_in_on_da_vinci_code_1_1116376 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=3 May 2006 |accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also claimed that other carvings in the chapel reflect [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] imagery, such as the way that hands are placed in various figures. One carving may show a blindfolded man being led forward with a noose around his neck — similar to the way a candidate is prepared for initiation into Freemasonry. The carving has been eroded by time and pollution and is difficult to make out clearly. The chapel was built in the 15th century, and the earliest records of Freemasonic lodges date back only to the late 16th and early 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandlodge-england.org/ugle/the-history-of-grand-lodge.htm History] page from the website of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]]&lt;/ref&gt; A more likely explanation however is that the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] imagery was added at a later date. This may have taken place in the 1860s when [[James St Clair-Erskine, 3rd Earl of Rosslyn]] instructed Edinburgh architect [[David Bryce]], a known Freemason, to undertake restoration work on areas of the church including many of the carvings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosslynchapel.org.uk/p/the-st-clair-family-I178/ |title=The St Clair Family |work=rosslynchapel.org.uk |publisher= |accessdate=5 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014230635/http://www.rosslynchapel.org.uk/p/the-st-clair-family-I178/ |archivedate=14 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative histories===
Alternative histories involving Rosslyn Chapel and the Sinclairs have been published by [[Andrew Sinclair]] and Tim Wallace-Murphy arguing links with the [[Knights Templar]] and the supposed descendants of [[Jesus Christ]]. The books in particular by Tim Wallace-Murphy and Marilyn Hopkins ''Rex Deus: The True Mystery of Rennes-le-Château And The Dynasty of Jesus (2000)'' and ''Custodians Of Truth: The Continuance Of Rex Deus'' (2005) have focused on the hypothetical [[Jesus bloodline]] with the Sinclairs and Rosslyn Chapel.

On the ABC documentary ''Jesus, Mary and Da Vinci'', aired on 3 November 2003, Niven Sinclair hinted that the descendants of Jesus Christ existed within the Sinclair families.  These alternative histories are relatively modern - not dating back before the early 1990s. The precursor to these Rosslyn theories is the 1982 book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' (retitled ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail'' in the United States) by [[Michael Baigent]], [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]] and [[Henry Lincoln]] that introduced the theory of the Jesus bloodline in relation to the [[Priory of Sion]] hoax - the main protagonist of which was [[Pierre Plantard]], who for a time adopted the name Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair.

'''Marcus Servilius Nonianus''' (died in 59{{nbs}}AD) was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman Senate|senator]], best known as a historian. He was [[Roman consul|ordinary consul]] in 35 as the colleague of [[Gaius Cestius Gallus (consul 35)|Gaius Cestius Gallus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annales (Tacitus)|Annales]]'', VI.31&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tacitus]] described Servilius Nonianus as a man of great eloquence and good-nature.&lt;ref name=Tacitus-19&gt;Tacitus, ''Annales'', XIV.19&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a history of Rome which is considered the major contribution on the topic between the works of [[Livy]] and [[Tacitus]], and which was much referred to by later historians; this history has since been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, "Servilius Nonianus", ''Hermes'', 92. Bd (1964), pp. 408, 421ff&lt;/ref&gt; A number of anecdotes regarding him survive and help to give an understanding of Roman life in the first century.

== Life ==
Nonianus was descended from [[Gaius Servilius Geminus (Praetor)|Gaius Servilius Geminus]] the [[praetor]], who had renounced his [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] status.&lt;ref name=Syme-409&gt;Syme, "Servilius Nonianus", p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Marcus Servilius]], consul in AD 3 and his mother the daughter of the [[Nonia (gens)|Nonius]], whom [[Mark Antony]] proscribed over the possession of a gem.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'', XXXVII.81&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[proconsul]]ar governor of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] in 46–47.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Vogel-Weidemann: ''Die Statthalter von Africa und Asia in den Jahren 14–68 n. Chr. Eine Untersuchung zum Verhältnis Princeps und Senat'' (Bonn: Dr. Rudolf Habelt, 1982), pp. 145–150 {{ISBN|3-7749-1412-5}}; Bengt E. Thomasson: ''Fasti Africani. Senatorische und ritterliche Amtsträger in den römischen Provinzen Nordafrikas von Augustus bis Diokletian'' (Stockholm: 1996), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] recounts several anecdotes concerning Nonianus. One was that he was terribly worried about losing his sight and to prevent this, Nonianus wore a lucky charm around his neck consisting of the two [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] [[alpha]] and [[rho]]. Pliny reports that the charm worked. Another anecdote was that his daughter was cured of an illness with goats' milk, as advised by the family doctor [[Servilius Democrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Syme, "Servilius Nonianus", ''Hermes'', 92. Bd (1964), pp. 408f&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Persius]] revered Nonianus like a father, according to the historian [[Ronald Syme]].&lt;ref&gt;Syme, "Servilius Nonianus", p. 415, citing ''Vita Persi'', l. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonianus married Considia; their daughter Servilia Considia married the senator [[Quintus Marcius Barea Soranus]]. This marriage and the admiration Persius had for him, led Syme to suspect Nonianus was part of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] circle of the [[Principate]].&lt;ref&gt;Syme, "Servilius Nonianus", pp. 414f&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus dates the death of Servilius Nonianus to 59, contrasting his elegant life to another senator who died that year, [[Domitius Afer]], who possessed the same genius yet was a provincial.&lt;ref name=Tacitus-19/&gt;

== Historical work ==
Servilius Nonianus wrote a book on the history of Rome but the work is not extant. Even its title is unknown. According to [[Tacitus]] and [[Quintilian]] this work was considered a very important reference book on Roman history, especially for those historians who belonged to the senatorial party. It is considered to be the leading Roman history between the works of [[Livy]] and Tacitus.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, "Servilius Nonianus", ''Hermes'', 92. Bd (1964), pp. 408, 421ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Quintilian writes that Servilius Nonianus used publicly to read his own work, ''recitationes''.&lt;ref&gt;''Institutio oratoria'' 10,1,102.&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have suggested Tacitus drew on Servilius Nonianus for his history of the first Imperial period, along with the historian [[Aufidius Bassus]].&lt;ref&gt;Devillers, ''Tacite'', pp. 15ff.; Syme, ''Tacitus'', Vol. 1, pp. 274ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The period covered by Nonianus' history is unknown. It is considered probable that Nonianus also covered the reign of the emperor Tiberius.&lt;ref&gt;See Sage, ''Historical Works'', p. 1006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Younger]] records the anecdote that during one of the public ''recitationes'' of Nonianus, the emperor [[Claudius]], who was strolling nearby, was so attracted by the applause that he asked who was reading, and joined the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, ''Epistulae'', I,13,3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shad''' ([[Old Turkic]]: [[File:Old Turkic letter D1.svg|10px]][[File:Old Turkic letter SH.svg|10px]], šad&lt;ref&gt;[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?l=Y&amp;wi=49&amp;lang=e&amp;mod=3 Ethno Cultural Dictionary, TÜRIK BITIG]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a state office in the early Central Asian [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] states, roughly equivalent to [[governor]]. "Shad" could only be an appointee over a vassal tribe, where he represented interests of the preeminent [[Khagan|Kagan]]. The name of this tribe was included in his title. For example, Tardu-shad could only be a Shad over Tardu tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Zuev Yu. A., ''"Horse  Tamgas from Vassal Princedoms (Translation of Chinese composition "Tanghuyao" of 8-10th centuries)"'', Kazakh SSR Academy of Sciences, Alma-Ata, I960, p. 107 (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; The title carried autonomy in different degrees, and its links with the central authority of kagan varied from economical and political subordination to superficial political deference.

The position of Shad was traditionally given to the member of a ruling ([[Ashina tribe|Ashina]]) clan. Frequently, Shad was a blood prince, a representative of the next generation. [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Mahmud Kashgari]] defined the title Shad as an heir apparent a step above [[Yabgu]].&lt;ref&gt;Golgen P.B., "Khazar studies", Budapest, Vol. 2, 1980, pp. 188-190, {{ISBN|963-05-1548-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Turkic [[Turgesh]] Kaganate, Shad was a ruler of the east wing, and
Yabgu was a ruler of the west wing of the state, both directly subordinated to the Kagan.  According to [[Movses Kagankatvatsi]], [[Böri Shad]] was a 7th-century [[Western Turkic Khaganate]] prince and an ''[[ishad]]'', or a ruler of a principality, a nephew of [[Tong Yabghu Khagan|Tong Yabgu Kagan]], and a son of ''[[Mo-ho sad|Moho shad]]'', who may have been a Yabgu of the [[Khazars]].&lt;ref&gt;Artamanov M., ''History of Khazars'', Leningrad, 1962, p 128, {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after a split of [[Western Turkic Kaganate]], the splinter western part was headed by ''Yukuk-shad'' of the royal Ashina clan, who became a Kagan of the "western surnames", with a throne name Yelbi-Turuk-Kagan.&lt;ref&gt;Zuev Yu. A., ''The strongest tribe'', p. 55-56, Almaty, 2004 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With weakening of centralized states, the Shads were gaining more sovereignty, and historical accounts record independent states with "Shad" as a supreme ruler. The title "Shad" left prominent marks in the Asian toponymy, and on many mints of Middle Asia Late Antique and Early Middle Age coins, like [[Shad Bagh]] in northern [[Lahore]] in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]], and early [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]] coins.

A name of one Shad in the waning days of the [[Turkic Khaganate|Eastern Turkic Kaganate]] is interpreted as an evidence of an early penetration of the [[Sunni]] branch of [[Islam]] to the Central Asian people. When the last Kagan [[Illig Qaghan]] suffered a defeat from the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] ([[Tuoba|Tuoba/Tabgach]]) empire in 630 CE, the Chinese annals recorded that after that surrendered his last loyal prince, ''Yshbara Shunishi-Shad'', and the Eastern Türkic Kaganate ceased to exist. Yshbara Shunishi-Shad was a head of the [[Basmyl]] tribe, and as indicated by his name, he was a [[Sunni]].&lt;ref&gt;Gumilev L.N., ''"Ancient Türks"'', [http://gumilevica.kulichki.net/OT/ot15 Ch.15], {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of London}}
This article covers the history of '''[[London]]''' during the [[Stuart dynasty|Stuart period]] from 1603 to 1714.

==James I==

The preparations for the coronation of [[James I of England|King James I]] were interrupted by a severe plague epidemic, which may have killed over thirty thousand people, and threats of assassination; in 1605 the infamous [[Gunpowder plot]] occurred, leading to a backlash against [[Catholic]]s. 

The [[Lord Mayor's Show]], which had been discontinued for some years, was revived by order of the king in 1609. The dissolved monastery of the [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse]], which had been bought and sold by the courtiers several times, was purchased by [[Thomas Sutton]] for £13,000. The new hospital, chapel, and schoolhouse were begun in 1611. [[Charterhouse School]] was to be one of the principal [[public school (England)|public schools]] in London until it moved to Surrey in the [[Victorian era]], and the site is still used as a [[Barts and The London, Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry|medical school]].

==Charles I==
[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ascended to the throne in 1625. During his reign aristocrats began to inhabit the [[West End of London|West End]] in large numbers. In addition to those who had specific business at court, increasing numbers of country landowners and their families lived in London for part of the year simply for the social life. This was the beginning of the "London season". [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], was built about 1629. The piazza of [[Covent Garden]], designed by England's first classically trained architect [[Inigo Jones]] followed in about 1632. The neighbouring streets were built shortly afterwards, and the names of Henrietta, Charles, James, King and York Streets were given after members of the royal family.

The two theatres on the foreground (Southwark) side of the Thames are [[The Bear Garden]] and [[Globe Theatre|The Globe]]. The large church in the foreground is St Mary Overie, now [[Southwark Cathedral]].}}

==London and the Civil War==
In January 1642 five members of parliament whom the King wished to arrest were granted refuge in the City. In August of the same year King Charles I raised his banner at [[Nottingham]], and during the [[English Civil War]] London took the side of the parliament. Initially the king had the upper hand in military terms and in November he won the [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Battle of Brentford]] a few miles to the west of London. 

The City organised a new makeshift army and Charles hesitated and retreated. Subsequently, an extensive system of fortifications was built to protect London from a renewed attack by the Royalists. This comprised a strong earthen rampart, enhanced with bastions and redoubts. It was well beyond the City walls and encompassed the whole urban area, including Westminster and Southwark. London was not seriously threatened by the royalists again, and the financial resources of the City made an important contribution to the parliamentarians victory in the war.

==Cromwellian period==

The civil war ended in defeat for the Royalists. The execution of King Charles on 30 January 1649, heralded [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s short lived [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]. 

In contrast to the common view of the period as being one of [[Puritan]] repression. Some music and [[opera]] flourished in London under Cromwell's patronage. In 1656 ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]'' the first true English opera was performed in London.

In 1655 Cromwell allowed [[Jew]]s to [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|return]] to London, ending a 365-year [[Edict of Expulsion|banishment]]. They built their first [[Synagogue]] in 1657 at Creechurch Lane.

Following Cromwell's death in 1658. His son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] took over, but was unable to command the support of parliament and army. The Commonwealth quickly collapsed, and in 1660 the monarchy was restored under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

==Plague and fire==

The unsanitary and overcrowded City of London has suffered from the numerous outbreaks of the plague many times over the centuries, but in Britain it is the last major outbreak which is remembered as the "[[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]]" It occurred in 1665 and 1666 and killed around 60,000 people, which was one fifth of the population. [[Samuel Pepys]] chronicled the epidemic in his diary. On 4 September 1665 he wrote ''"I have stayed in the city till above 7400 died in one week, and of them about 6000 of the plague, and little noise heard day or night but tolling of bells." ''

The Great Plague was immediately followed by another catastrophe, albeit one which helped to put an end to the plague{{Citation needed|reason=says who?|date=August 2012}}. On the Sunday, 2 September 1666 the [[Great Fire of London]] broke out at one o'clock in the morning at a house in Pudding Lane in the southern part of the City. Fanned by an eastern wind the fire spread, and efforts to arrest it by pulling down houses to make firebreaks were disorganised to begin with. On Tuesday night the wind fell somewhat, and on Wednesday the fire slackened. On Thursday it was extinguished, but on the evening of that day the flames again burst forth at the Temple. Some houses were at once blown up by gunpowder, and thus the fire was finally mastered. [[The Monument]] was built to commemorate the fire: for over a century and a half it bore an inscription attributing the conflagration to a ''"popish frenzy"''.
[[File:John Evelyn's plan for the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire.JPG|thumb|300px|John Evelyn's plan for the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire.]]
The fire destroyed about 60% of the City, including [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], 87 parish churches, 44 [[livery company]] halls and the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]]. However the number of lives lost was surprisingly small; it is believed to have been 16 at most. Arguably, the fire resulted in a better visual aesthetic of the city. Within a few days of the fire, three plans were presented to the king for the rebuilding of the city, by [[Christopher Wren]], [[John Evelyn]] and [[Robert Hooke]]. Wren proposed to build main thoroughfares north and south, and east and west, to insulate all the churches in conspicuous positions, to form the most public places into large piazzas, to unite the halls of the 12 chief livery companies into one regular square annexed to the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and to make a fine quay on the bank of the river from [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] to the [[Tower of London]]. Wren wished to build the new streets straight and in three standard widths of thirty, sixty and ninety feet. Evelyn's plan differed from Wren's chiefly in proposing a street from the church of [[St Dunstan's in the East]] to the St Paul's, and in having no quay or terrace along the river. These plans were not implemented, and the rebuilt city generally followed the streetplan of the old one, and most of it has survived into the 21st century.

[[File:London - Richard Blome's map of 1673.JPG|thumb|300px|Richard Blome's map of London (1673). The development of the West End had recently begun to accelerate.]]

Nonetheless, the new City was different from the old one. Many aristocratic residents never returned, preferring to take new houses in the West End, where fashionable new districts such as [[St. James's]] were built close to the main royal residence, which was [[Whitehall Palace]] until it was destroyed by fire in the 1690s, and thereafter [[St. James's Palace]]. The rural lane of [[Piccadilly]] sprouted courtiers mansions such as [[Burlington House]]. Thus the separation between the middle class mercantile City of London, and the aristocratic world of the court in [[Westminster]] became complete. In the City itself there was a move from wooden buildings to stone and brick construction to reduce the risk of fire. The [[Act of Parliament]] "for rebuilding the city of London" stated ''"building with brick [is] not only more comely and durable, but also more safe against future perils of fire"''. From then on only doorcases, window-frames and shop fronts were allowed to be made of wood.

Christopher Wren's plan for a new model London came to nothing, but he was appointed to rebuild the ruined parish churches and to replace [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. His domed [[baroque]] cathedral was the primary symbol of London for at least a century and a half. As city surveyor, [[Robert Hooke]] oversaw the reconstruction of the City's houses. The [[East End]], that is the area immediately to the east of the city walls, also became heavily populated in the decades after the Great Fire. London's docks began to extend downstream, attracting many working people who worked on the docks themselves and in the processing and distributive trades. These people lived in [[Whitechapel]], [[Wapping]], [[Stepney]] and [[Limehouse]], generally in slum conditions.

==Development, culture and trade==

London's expansion beyond the boundaries of the City was decisively established in the 17th century. In the opening years of that century the immediate environs of the City, with the principal exception of the aristocratic residences in the direction of Westminster, were still considered insalubrious. Immediately to the north was [[Moorfields]], which had recently been drained and laid out in walks, but it was frequented by beggars and travellers, who crossed it in order to get into London, tried not to linger. Adjoining Moorfields were [[Finsbury]] Fields, a favourite practising ground for the archers. [[Mile End]], then a common on the Great Eastern Road, was famous as a rendezvous for the troops.

In the winter of 1683–4 a [[Thames frost fairs|frost fair]] was held on the Thames. The frost, which began about seven weeks before Christmas and continued for six weeks after, was the greatest on record. The [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, led to a large migration on [[Huguenots]] to London. They established a silk industry at [[Spitalfields]].

The general meeting-place of Londoners in the day-time was the nave of [[Old St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Merchants conducted business in the aisles, and used the font as a counter upon whichto make their payments; lawyers received clients at their particular pillars; and the unemployed looked for work. St Paul's Churchyard was the centre of the book trade and [[Fleet Street]] was a centre of public entertainment. Under James I the theatre, which established itself so firmly in the latter years of Elizabeth, grew further in popularity. The performances at the public theatres were complemented by elaborate [[masques]] at the royal court and at the inns of court. 

At this time the City of London was becoming the world's leading financial centre, superseding [[Amsterdam]] in primacy. The [[Bank of England]] was founded in 1694, and the [[British East India Company]] was expanding its influence. [[Lloyd's of London]] also began to operate in the late 17th century. In 1700 London handled 80% of England's imports, 69% of its exports and 86% of its re-exports. Many of the goods were luxuries from the Americas and Asia such as silk, sugar, tea and tobacco. The last figure emphasises London's role as an [[entrepot]]: while it had many craftsmen in the 17th century, and would later acquire some large factories, its economic prominence was never based primarily on industry. Instead it was a great trading and redistribution centre. Goods were brought to London by England's increasingly dominant merchant navy, not only to satisfy domestic demand, but also for re-export throughout Europe and beyond.

[[William III of England|William III]] cared little for London, the smoke of which gave him asthma, and after the first fire at Whitehall Palace (1691) he purchased Nottingham House and transformed it into [[Kensington Palace]]. [[Kensington]] was then an insignificant village, but the arrival of the court soon caused it to grow in importance. The palace was rarely favoured by future monarchs, but its construction was another step in the expansion of the bounds of London. During the same reign [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]], then well outside the boundary of London, but now comfortably inside it, was begun; it was the naval complement to the [[Chelsea Hospital]] for former soldiers, which has been founded in 1681. During the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] an act was passed authorising the building of 50 new churches to serve the greatly increased population living outside the boundaries of the City of London.

'''''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'''''{{efn|sometimes shortened to '''''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'''''}} is a six-volume work by the English historian [[Edward Gibbon]]. It traces Western civilization (as well as the [[Muslim conquests|Islamic]] and [[Mongolian Empire|Mongolian]] conquests) from the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty|height]] of the [[Roman Empire]] to the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall]] of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]].

The six volumes cover the history, from 98 to 1590, of the [[Roman Empire]], the history of [[early Christianity]] and then of the [[State church of the Roman Empire|Roman State Church]], and the history of Europe, and discusses the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] among other things.

Gibbon’s work remains a great literary achievement and a very readable introduction to the period, but considerable progress has since been made in history and archaeology, and his interpretations no longer represent current academic knowledge or thought. In [[The World of Late Antiquity (1971)|''The World of Late Antiquity'' (1971)]], [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] offers an alternative interpretation of the period between the second and eighth centuries CE, and ''[[Framing the Early Middle Ages]]'' (2005) by [[Christopher Wickham]] presents hitherto unavailable evidence from both documentary and archaeological sources.

== Thesis ==
Gibbon offers an explanation for the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]], a task made difficult by a lack of comprehensive written sources, though he was not the only historian to attempt it.{{efn|See for example [[Henri Pirenne#Pirenne Thesis|Henri Pirenne's (1862–1935) famous thesis]] published in the early 20th century. As for sources more recent than the ancients, Gibbon certainly drew on [[Montesquieu]]'s short essay, [[Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline]], and on previous work published by [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] (1627–1704) in his ''Histoire universelle à Monseigneur le dauphin'' (1763). see Pocock, ''The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737–1764''. for Bousset, pp. 65, 145; for Montesquieu, pp. 85–88, 114, 223.}}

According to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to [[barbarian]] invasions in large part due to the gradual loss of [[civic virtue]] among its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, "Between Machiavelli and Hume: Gibbon as Civic Humanist and Philosophical Historian," ''Daedalus'' 105:3 (1976), 153–169; and in '''[[#Further reading|Further reading]]:''' Pocock, ''The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737–1764'', 303–304; ''The First Decline and Fall'', 304–306.&lt;/ref&gt;  
He began an ongoing controversy about the role of Christianity, but he gave great weight to other causes of internal decline and to [[Migration Period|attacks from outside the Empire]]. {{blockquote|The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and, instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians. |Edward Gibbon. ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter 38 "General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West"}}

Like other [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] citizens of the age steeped in institutional [[anti-Catholicism]], Gibbon held in contempt the [[Medievalism|Middle Ages]] as a priest-ridden, superstitious [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]].  It was not until his own era, the "Age of Reason", with its emphasis on rational thought, it was believed, that human history could resume its progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.G.A. |last=Pocock |year=1976 |title=Between Machiavelli and Hume: Gibbon as Civic Humanist and Philosophical Historian |journal=Daedalus |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=153–169}}; and in '''[[#Further reading|Further reading]]:''' Pocock, ''The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737–1764'', 303–304; ''The First Decline and Fall'', 304–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==

Gibbon's tone was detached, dispassionate, and yet critical. He can lapse into moralisation and [[aphorism]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Foster|title=Melancholy Duty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5fcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|year=2013|page=63|isbn=9789401722353 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citations and footnotes ===
Gibbon provides the reader with a glimpse of his thought process with extensive notes along the body of the text, a precursor to the modern use of footnotes. Gibbon's footnotes are famous for their idiosyncratic and often humorous style, and have been called "Gibbon's table talk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Saunders |editor-first=Dero A. |title=Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |year=1952 |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |at=page&amp;nbsp;23 (Introduction)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide an entertaining moral commentary on both [[ancient Rome]] and 18th&amp;nbsp;century [[Great Britain]]. This technique enabled Gibbon to compare ancient Rome to his own contemporary world. Gibbon's work advocates a [[rationalist]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] view of history.

Gibbon's citations provide in-depth detail regarding his use of sources for his work, which included documents dating back to ancient Rome. The detail within his asides and his care in noting the importance of each document is a precursor to modern-day historical footnoting methodology.

The work is notable for its erratic but exhaustively documented notes and research. [[J.B. Bury|John Bury]], following him 113&amp;nbsp;years later with his own ''History of the Later Roman Empire'', commended the depth and accuracy of Gibbon's work. Unusually for 18th&amp;nbsp;century historians, Gibbon was not content with second-hand accounts when primary sources were accessible. "I have always endeavoured", Gibbon wrote, "to draw from the fountain-head; that my curiosity, as well as a sense of duty, has always urged me to study the originals; and that, if they have sometimes eluded my search, I have carefully marked the secondary evidence, on whose faith a passage or a fact were reduced to depend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |at=page&amp;nbsp;520, Preface to Gibbon's ''Volume the Fourth'' |editor-first=David |editor-last=Womersley |title=Edward Gibbon – The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |volume=2 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Decline and Fall'' is a literary monument and a massive step forward in [[historical method]].{{efn|In the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, biographer [[Sir Leslie Stephen]] summarized ''The History''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s reputation as a work of unmatched erudition, a degree of professional esteem which remains as strong today as it was then:&lt;blockquote&gt;The criticisms upon his book ... are nearly unanimous. In accuracy, thoroughness, lucidity, and comprehensive grasp of a vast subject, the History is unsurpassable.  It is the one English history which may be regarded as definitive.  ... Whatever its shortcomings, the book is artistically imposing as well as historically unimpeachable as a vast [[panorama]] of a great period.

==Criticism==
Numerous tracts were published criticising his work. In response, Gibbon defended his work with the 1779 publication of, ''A Vindication ... of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Gibbon| title = A vindication of some passages in the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters of The history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire: By the author| url = https://books.google.com/?id=tnxbAAAAQAAJ| year = 1779| publisher = Printed for W. Strahan; and T. Cadell, in the Strand.| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks on Christianity aroused particularly vigorous attacks, but in the mid-twentieth century, at least one author claimed that "church historians allow the substantial justness of [Gibbon's] main positions."&lt;ref&gt;''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', vol. IV, eds. S.M. Jackson, et al. (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Book House, 1952), 483–484. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc04/Page_484.html online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gibbon's views on religion==

===Criticism of Quran and Muhammad===

Gibbon's comments on the [[Quran]] and [[Muhammad]] reflected his view of the secular origin of the text. He outlined in chapter 33 the widespread tale of the [[Seven Sleepers]],&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Iqbal, (2017). “A New Theory on Aṣḥāb al-kahf (The Sleepers of the Cave) Based on Evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS)”. Al-Bayān – Journal of Qurʾān and ḤadĪth Studies 15 (2017). {{DOI|10.1163/22321969-12340044}}. pp. 20–47. Retrieved from http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22321969-12340044#&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked "This popular tale, which Mahomet might learn when he drove his camels to the fairs of Syria, is introduced, as a divine revelation, into the Quran." His presentation of Muhammad's life again reflected his secular approach: "in his private conduct, Mahomet indulged the appetites of a man, and abused the claims of a prophet. A special revelation dispensed him from the laws which he had imposed on his nation: the female sex, without reserve, was abandoned to his desires; and this singular prerogative excited the envy, rather than the scandal, the veneration, rather than the envy, of the devout Mussulmans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/gibbon/decline/files/volume2/chap50.htm#Private|title=Chapter 50 of 'The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire'|first=Edward|last=Gibbon|website=www.ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Views on Jews and charge of antisemitism===
Gibbon described the Jews as "''a race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but also of humankind''".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward. "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire", page 521 in the first volume.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his view Gibbon has been charged with [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eipa.eu.com/category/information-centre/international-relations/anti-semitism/ | title=Anti-Semitism &amp;#124; EIPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of Christian martyrs===
Gibbon challenged Church history by estimating far smaller numbers of [[Christian martyrs]] than had been traditionally accepted. The Church's version of its early history had rarely been questioned before. Gibbon, however, knew that modern Church writings were [[secondary source]]s, and he shunned them in favor of [[primary source]]s.

===Christianity as a contributor to the fall and to stability: chapters XV, XVI===
Historian S.P. Foster says that Gibbon:
:blamed the otherworldly preoccupations of Christianity for the decline of the Roman empire, heaped scorn and abuse on the church, and sneered at the entirety of monasticism as a dreary, superstition-ridden enterprise. The ''Decline and Fall'' compares Christianity invidiously with both the pagan religions of Rome and the religion of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.P. Foster|title=Melancholy Duty: The Hume-Gibbon Attack on Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5fcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|date= 2013|publisher=Springer |page=16|isbn=9789401722353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume I was originally published in sections, as was common for large works at the time. The first two were well received and widely praised. The last quarto in Volume I, especially Chapters XV and XVI, was highly controversial, and Gibbon was attacked as a "[[paganism|paganist]]". Gibbon thought that Christianity had hastened the Fall, but also ameliorated the results:

{{quote|As the happiness of a future life is the great object of religion, we may hear without surprise or scandal that the introduction, or at least the abuse of Christianity, had some influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire. The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity; the active virtues of society were discouraged; and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the cloister: a large portion of public and private wealth was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and the soldiers' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity. Faith, zeal, curiosity, and more earthly passions of malice and ambition, kindled the flame of theological discord; the church, and even the state, were distracted by religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody and always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of tyranny; and the persecuted sects became the secret enemies of their country. Yet party-spirit, however pernicious or absurd, is a principle of union as well as of dissension. The bishops, from eighteen hundred pulpits, inculcated the duty of passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign; their frequent assemblies and perpetual correspondence maintained the communion of distant churches; and the benevolent temper of the Gospel was strengthened, though confirmed, by the spiritual alliance of the Catholics. The sacred indolence of the monks was devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age; but if superstition had not afforded a decent retreat, the same vices would have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert, from baser motives, the standard of the republic. Religious precepts are easily obeyed which indulge and sanctify the natural inclinations of their votaries; but the pure and genuine influence of Christianity may be traced in its beneficial, though imperfect, effects on the barbarian proselytes of the North. If the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion of Constantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall, and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors (chap. 38).&lt;ref&gt;General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West. Fall In The West – The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon. At Christian Classics Ethereal Library, Calvin College Computer Science.  http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume1/chap39.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Voltaire]] was deemed to have influenced Gibbon's claim that Christianity was a contributor to the fall of the Roman Empire.  As one pro-Christian commenter put it in 1840:

{{quote|As Christianity advances, disasters befall the [Roman] empire—arts, science, literature, decay—barbarism and all its revolting concomitants are made to seem the consequences of its decisive triumph—and the unwary reader is conducted, with matchless dexterity, to the desired conclusion—the abominable Manicheism of ''Candide'', and, in fact, of all the productions of Voltaire's historic school—viz., "that instead of being a merciful, ameliorating, and benignant visitation, the religion of Christians would rather seem to be a scourge sent on man by the author of all evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dublin review: a quarterly and critical journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JItKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|year=1840|publisher=Burns, Oates and Washbourne|pages=208–|quote=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JItKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA208&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U2PHcJJoA3dkDDwsI-CJbanilJcVg&amp;ci=104%2C652%2C854%2C302&amp;edge=0 p.&amp;nbsp;208&amp;nbsp;image] at Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tolerant paganism===

Gibbon wrote:

{{quote|The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true; by the philosophers as equally false; and by the magistrate as equally useful.}} He has been criticized for his portrayal of Paganism as tolerant and Christianity as intolerant. In an article that appeared in 1996 in the journal ''[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]]'', H.A. Drake challenges an understanding of [[Persecution of religion in ancient Rome|religious persecution in ancient Rome]], which he considers to be the "conceptual scheme" that was used by historians to deal with the topic for the last 200 years, and whose most eminent representative is Gibbon. Drake counters:

{{quote|With such deft strokes, Gibbon enters into a conspiracy with his readers: unlike the credulous masses, he and we are cosmopolitans who know the uses of religion as an instrument of social control. So doing, Gibbon skirts a serious problem: for three centuries prior to Constantine, the tolerant pagans who people the Decline and Fall were the authors of several major persecutions, in which Christians were the victims. ... Gibbon covered this embarrassing hole in his argument with an elegant demur. Rather than deny the obvious, he adroitly masked the question by transforming his Roman magistrates into models of Enlightenment rulers—reluctant persecutors, too sophisticated to be themselves religious zealots.}}

==Misinterpretation of Byzantium==
Others such as [[John Julius Norwich]], despite their admiration for his furthering of historical methodology, consider Gibbon's hostile views on the [[Byzantine Empire]] flawed and blame him somewhat for the lack of interest shown in the subject throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;John Julius Norwich, ''Byzantium'' (New York: Knopf, 1989); ''Byzantium: the apogee'' (London and New York: Viking Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; This view might well be admitted by Gibbon himself: "But it is not my intention to expatiate with the same minuteness on the whole series of the Byzantine history."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/gibbon/decline/files/preface.htm Preface of 1782 online].&lt;/ref&gt; However the Russian historian [[George Ostrogorsky]] writes, "Gibbon and [[Charles le Beau|Lebeau]] were genuine historians—and Gibbon a very great one—and their works, in spite of factual inadequacy, rank high for their presentation of their material."&lt;ref&gt;Georgije Ostrogorski  [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22gibbon+and+lebeau+were+genuine+historians%22&amp;num=10 ''History of the Byzantine State'' (1986) p. 5 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gibbon's reflections==
Gibbon's initial plan was to write a history "''of the decline and fall of the ''city'' of Rome''", and only later expanded his scope to the whole Roman Empire:&lt;blockquote&gt; If I prosecute this ''History'', I shall not be unmindful of the decline and fall of the ''city'' of Rome; an interesting object, to which my plan was originally confined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Gibbon |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |volume=3 |at=chapter&amp;nbsp;36, footnote&amp;nbsp;43 |year=1781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he published other books, Gibbon devoted much of his life to this one work (1772–1789). His autobiography [[Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon#The Miscellaneous Works|''Memoirs of My Life and Writings'']] is devoted largely to his reflections on how the book virtually ''became'' his life. He compared the publication of each succeeding volume to a newborn child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patricia B. |last=Craddock |title=Edward Gibbon, Luminous Historian |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ. Press |year=1989 |pages=249–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
Gibbon continued to revise and change his work even after publication. The complexities of the problem are addressed in Womersley's introduction and appendices to his complete edition.

Many writers have used variations on the series title (including using "Rise and Fall" in place of "Decline and Fall"), especially when dealing with large nations or empires.

'''''The Interlude of the Student and the Girl''''' ({{lang-la|Interludium de clerico et puella}}) is one of the earliest known [[Secularity|secular]] plays in English, first performed c. 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 9; 11), Brockett and Hildy (2003, 95), Dillon (2006, 213), Meredith (1998, 699), Richardson &amp; Johnston (1991, 54–55), and Wickham (1976, 195; 1981, 189–190).&lt;/ref&gt; The text is written in [[vernacular]] English, in an [[East Midlands]] [[dialect]] that suggests either [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] or [[Beverley]] as its origin, although its title is given in [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=wick193&gt;Wickham (1976, 193).&lt;/ref&gt; The name of its playwright is unknown.&lt;ref name=wick193/&gt; Only two scenes, with a total of 84 lines of [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse]] in [[Rhyme|rhyming]] [[couplet]]s, are [[Extant literature|extant]] and survive in a manuscript held by the [[British Museum]], dated to either the late twelfth or very early thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Additional MS 23986; see Wickham (1976, 193). In the nineteenth century, the manuscript belonged to the Rev. Richard Yerburgh of [[Sleaford]], father of the conservative politician [[Robert Armstrong Yerburgh]]; see Chambers (1903, 324).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glynne Wickham]] provides both the original text and a rendering in modern English in his ''English Moral Interludes'' (1976).&lt;ref name=caveat&gt;Wickham (1976, 195–203). [[E. K. Chambers]] also provided the text in his ''The Mediaeval Stage'' (1903, vol. 2, 324–326), though Wickham points out that in that book the scenes have been inaccurately transcribed; see Wickham (1979, 198). Chamber's book is {{Internet Archive|mediaevalstage07chamgoog|available online}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In tone and form, the [[Morality play|interlude]] seems to be the closest play in English to the contemporaneous French [[farce]]s, such as ''[[The Boy and the Blind Man]]'', and is related to later English farcical plays, such as the [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] ''Calisto and Melibea'' (published c. 1525) and [[John Heywood]]'s ''The Foure PP'' (c. 1530).&lt;ref&gt;Axton (1979, 15), Bevington (1962, 9; 11; 38; 45), Meredith (1998, 699), and Wickham (1981, 190). ''Calisto and Melibea'' is an adaptation of ''[[La Celestina]]''; see Axton (1979, 69–96).&lt;/ref&gt; It was most likely performed by itinerant players, possibly making use of a performing dog.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Johnston (1991, 54–55).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Early English Stages'' (1981), Wickham points to the existence of this play as evidence that the old-fashioned view that [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] began in England with ''[[Gammer Gurton's Needle]]'' and ''[[Ralph Roister Doister]]'' in the 1550s is mistaken, ignoring as it does a rich tradition of [[Medieval theatre|medieval comic drama]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1981, 178).&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the play's "command of dramatic action and of comic mood and method is so deft as to make it well-nigh unbelievable" that it was the first of its kind in England.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1981, 190).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Synopsis==
A student tries to woo a girl called Molly. Having confirmed that neither her father nor mother are at home, he declares his love for her: "I love you more than my life", he insists.&lt;ref&gt;"Y luf þe mar þan mi lif" (line 19); see Wickham (1976, 200–201). The original text makes use of the [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]] letter.&lt;/ref&gt; She rejects him, complaining of the deceitfulness of students: "For many a good woman have they brought to shame!"&lt;ref&gt;"Clerc of scole ne kep I none, / For many god wymman haf þai don scam" (lines 28–29); see Wickham (1976, 200–201). The original text makes use of the [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]] letter.&lt;/ref&gt; He seeks the help of an old woman, Mother Eloise. He laments that he would rather die than live without Molly. He offers the old woman substantial financial rewards if she would agree to act as his go-between and reconcile him with the girl. The old woman becomes defensive and insists that whoever advised him to seek out her assistance has lied, for she is a god-fearing woman who would never involve herself in such matters.

'''''The Isle of Dogs''''' is a play by [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Ben Jonson]] which was performed in 1597. It was immediately suppressed, and no copy of it is known to exist.

==The play==
The play was performed, probably by [[Pembroke's Men]], at the [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan Theatre]] in [[Bankside]] in July or August of 1597. A satirical comedy, it was reported to the authorities as a "lewd plaie" full of seditious and "slanderous matter". While extant records do not indicate what gave offence, a reference in ''[[Parnassus Plays|The Returne from Parnassus (II)]]'' suggests that the Queen herself was satirised. Other evidence suggests that [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham]] may have been the target.

The [[Isle of Dogs]] is a location in London on the opposite bank of the Thames to [[Greenwich]], home of a royal palace, [[Palace of Placentia|Placentia]], where indeed the Privy Council met. It was also believed to be where the queen kennelled her dogs, hence the name. David Riggs suggests that the satire might have been related to portrayal of the queen's councillors as lapdogs.&lt;ref&gt;David Riggs, ''Ben Jonson: A Life'', Harvard University Press, 1989, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the title alone does not indicate the play's content, since this area was also known as an unhealthy swamp where river sewage would accumulate. The Isle is also mentioned in ''[[Eastward Hoe]]'' (1605), another play for which Jonson was arrested. Nashe also referred to the location in ''[[Summer's Last Will and Testament]]'': "Here's a coyle about dogges without wit. If I had thought the ship of fooles would have stayed to take in fresh water at the Ile of dogges I would have furnished it with a whole kennel of collections to the purpose."

==The punishment==
Whatever the cause, [[Richard Topcliffe]] informed [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], who raised the issue to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. Three of the players ([[Gabriel Spenser]], Robert Shaa, and Ben Jonson) were arrested and sent to [[Marshalsea Prison]]. Nashe's home was raided (he was then at [[Great Yarmouth]]) and his papers seized, but he escaped imprisonment. He later wrote that he had given birth to a monster — "it was no sooner borne but I was glad to runne from it." Nashe was later to call it "an imperfit Embrion of my idle houres" and claimed to have written only the introduction and first act. For his part, Jonson recalled that he said nothing but "[[yes and no]]". Authorities placed two informers ([[Robert Poley]] and someone surnamed Parrot) with him; those two are referred to in his [[Epigram]] 59, ''Of Spies''.

After this burst of repression, royal authorities appear to have let the matter drop without incident. The report of the initial arrest says that "the rest of the players or actors in that matter shall be apprehended", but no one else ever was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-01-01|title=The Commercial Theater in England|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3427400752.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaa and Spenser were released quickly, and even Jonson was out of jail by early in October. Pembroke's Men were in action again, as were the other companies, before winter of that year. The only party permanently hurt was the Swan's [[impresario]] [[Francis Langley]], who alone among the play's producers was not able to obtain relicensing. Langley had apparently run afoul of the Privy Council on an unrelated matter involving a large Portuguese diamond that Langley had fenced, or planned to fence.

==The incident and the London play-world==

The suppression of ''Isle of Dogs'' has long been understood as a significant episode in the complex relations of city, court, and theatre-worlds; its precise significance, however, is difficult to determine. [[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|Chambers]], while noting Langley's diamond involvement, viewed the play as related to the Privy Council's 28 July order prohibiting acting and ordering that the theatres be "plucked down"; in this view, the leniency shown to the companies later in the year reflects the transient nature of the offence. Others, among them William Ingram, have questioned this chronology. The 28 July order does not mention the play; it was written in response to one of the city authorities' periodic pleas for an end to the theatres. The Council issued specific orders against the play in the next month. In this light, Pembroke's men may have made their offence worse by performing the play (wittingly or not) after the date of prohibition. Moreover, Cecil's anger over the stolen diamond may suggest that Langley was the sole target of the July injunction. [[Andrew Gurr]] adds to this picture by noting the tendency of the Court to license two chief companies throughout the later Elizabethan and early Stuart periods.

==Later references==
The image of ''The Isle of Dogs'' conjured up a society ruined by envy, and Nashe also refers to [[Sirius]] the dog star in ''[[Summer's Last Will and Testament]]'' in relation to the dog days of July. [[Richard Lichfield]] was to taunt Nashe with this in his ''The Trimming of Thomas Nash gentleman''.

{{Tony Blair sidebar}}
The '''timeline for the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] leadership elections of 2007''' is a timeline of events relating to the final years of [[Tony Blair]]'s tenure as leader of the party and Prime Minister and the leadership elections to find replacements for him and Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]], from his announcement that he would not lead Labour into a fourth General Election, concluding with [[Gordon Brown]] becoming Prime Minister.

==Initial signals that Blair's leadership was to end==
{{see also|2004 in the United Kingdom|2005 in the United Kingdom}}
On 30 September 2004, [[Tony Blair]] said he would not seek a fourth term as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Labour went on to win a third successive term at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|May 2005 General Election]] with a decreased majority of 66, with Blair pledging to serve another full term.

Labour and Blair subsequently had a surge in popularity at the time of [[Timeline of the 2005 London bombings|terrorist bombings of London]] of July 2005, but by the Spring of 2006 were facing significant difficulties, most notably with scandals over failures by the [[Home Office]] to deport illegal immigrants and national campaigns by many political parties and think tanks saying that the United Kingdom was being overrun by immigrants. Worries over the potential increase of support for the [[British National Party]] during the [[UK local elections, 2006|2006 Local Election]] campaign saw many Labour backbenchers and activists begin to demand a timetable from Blair for his departure, with many suggesting that it should be sooner rather than later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2006/election_2006/default.stm | title =Election 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=23 April 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation over the timing of Blair's resignation had been amplified by a variety of politicians and newspapers making their own predictions.  On 6 September 2006, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported that Blair would announce a timetable on 31 May 2007, with his replacement to take office by the end of July,&lt;ref name="The Sun"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006410396,00.html | title =Blair tells aides he quits May 31 | author =George Pascoe-Watson | date =6 September 2006 | work =[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 21 April [[The Guardian]] reported that the Brown camp were working on the assumption that Blair would announce the candidacy open on 9 May 2007, the day after power-sharing was due to start in [[Northern Ireland]], following which the new Labour leader would be elected on 15 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2062309,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=11| title = Brown shows his hand to stifle challenge from left| date =21 April 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=David | last=Hencke | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talk of [[David Miliband]], [[Alan Milburn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2077454,00.html | title =Blair backs Brown as chancellor launches campaign | author = Deborah Summers and agencies| date =11 May 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Clarke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/04/23/nbrown23.xml

==Demands for Tony Blair to announce a resignation timetable==
{{see also|2006 in the United Kingdom}}
On 15 July 2006, [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] became the first Labour MP to announce an intention to stand for the leadership when Blair resigned.

On 23 September, John Hutton became the first serving Cabinet Minister to say that [[Gordon Brown]] should face a serious challenger for Labour's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5372832.stm | title =Hutton call to 'challenge' Brown | date=23 September 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Labour Party (UK) Conference#2006 Manchester|2006 Labour Party Conference]] on 25 September, Brown announced his candidacy for the leadership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5376760.stm | title =Brown sets out leadership vision |date=25 September 2006| publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; while three days later at the same conference [[John Prescott]] announced that he would stand down when Blair resigned as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5386428.stm | title =Prescott tells Labour: I'm sorry | date = 28 September 2006| publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the debate on [[State Opening of Parliament|The Queen's Speech]] on 15 November, Blair said [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader [[David Cameron]] was a "[[flyweight]] against a [[heavyweight]]" at the next general election, widely interpreted as implicit support for Brown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061115/debtext/61115-0005.htm | title =House of Commons Hansard ("Debates") 15 Nov 2006 : Column 27 | date =15 November 2006 | work=Hansard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigning commences==
In January 2007, Brown outlined a number of his potential policies for Britain, mentioning citizen responsibility, education, efforts to solve problems in Africa and "a new style of politics" as his priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6238565.stm | title =Brown outlines patriotic vision | date =7 January 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6259131.stm | title =Brown outlines vision for Britain | date =13 January 2007 |publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January, he spoke of "a new world order" while on a tour of India, and announced backing for India's bid for a place as a permanent member on the [[UN Security Council]], and on many other international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6269653.stm | title =Brown backs stronger India role | date =17 January 2007 | work [[BBC News]]= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March, at 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm, he delivered the budget for the 2007–08 financial year, his last budget as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].

On 16 January, Blair declared his intention to attend a summit of EU leaders as Prime Minister on 21–22 June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1991702,00.html | title =Of course I will stay till June, says Blair | date =16 January 2007 | agency =[[Press Association]] | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 28 January stated that he was "not finished yet", and intended to complete the public sector reforms he had started, as well as leading Labour into local and devolved Elections on 3 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6307541.stm | title =I am not finished yet, says Blair | date =28 January 2007 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January, [[left-wing]] MP [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] claimed that support for his leadership challenge had grown to within striking distance of the necessary backing. Michael Meacher, former [[Minister of State|Minister of State for the Environment]] in the [[Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions|DETR]] and its successor [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Defra]] announced that he was also seeking nominations from MPs and was considering standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1992396,00.html | title =Labour rebel claims growing support for leadership bid | author =Hélène Mulholland | date =17 January 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February he became the third Labour MP to announce his intention to stand for the leadership, although critics in the media expressed doubt over the extent of backbench support for either challenger at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2019175,00.html | title =Left without direction | date =22 February 2007 | publisher =[[BBC News]] | location=London | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March, [[Jack Straw]] casually declined to run for the leadership after reports that someone had placed a £500 bet on his winning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2318734.ece | title =Brown squeezes public sector pay to prepare for Tory battle | author =Colin Brown | date =2 March 2007 | work =[[The Independent]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March, the Labour Party NEC met to decide on rules for the upcoming leadership elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://www.labour.org.uk/nec_reports| title = Labour NEC Reports | date = 20 March 2007| work = [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] website }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April, Brown met US President [[George W. Bush]] for the first time, in a reportedly amicable discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=aN9kLwDL3F3 | title =Gordon Brown 'Got on Very Well' With Bush in First Meeting  | date =15 April 2007 | publisher =[[Bloomberg L.P.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April he encouraged rivals to "bring it on", in response to numerous reports suggesting that he would face three or four contenders for the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_headline=gang-of-four--&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18910619&amp;siteid=89520-name_page.html | title=Chancellor tells likely rivals to 'feel free' to stand against him | author =Oonagh Blackman | date =16 April 2007 | work =[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Miliband]] declared on 17 April that he would not be a candidate for the Labour leadership or [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy leadership]], and had not wavered in his position on that issue in the past three years. He subsequently announced his support for Brown in any leadership election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6580589.stm | title= Miliband promises to back Brown | date =22 April 2007| publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that many of Blair's closest allies were eager to unite the Blair and Brown camps and prevent any challenge to Gordon Brown from dividing the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2465958.ece| title =  Blairites: Clarke challenge could split party| date =20 April 2007 | work =[[The Independent]] | location=London | first1=Colin | last1=Brown | first2=Andrew | last2=Grice | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that 217 MPs had already signed up to back Gordon Brown's leadership. There were also reports that even among the undecided, many were keen to prevent the progress of Michael Meacher and John McDonnell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2062309,00.html| title = Brown shows his hand to stifle challenge from left| date =21 April 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=David | last=Hencke | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April, [[Michael Meacher]] and [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] agreed that whichever had fewer supporters the day after Blair resigned as Labour leader would step aside, to allow the other a stronger chance to secure the support of the 45 MPs necessary to qualify for the ballot paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6598683.stm | title=Left rivals unite to target Brown| date=27 April 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May, Blair announced that he would announce his resignation as Labour leader the following week, following which he expected a campaign of about seven weeks. He also announced his support for Brown to succeed him as Labour leader and Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6610623.stm | title =Brown to be PM 'in weeks' – Blair| publisher=[[BBC News]] | date =1 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May, the day after Blair and Brown's tenth anniversary as Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, elections were held for [[UK local elections, 2007|English and Scottish Local Government]], [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|the Scottish Parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|the Welsh Assembly]]. Labour faced mixed results, making gains in some areas, with slightly higher support than the previous year in the Local Elections and fairly minimal losses in the devolved elections, remaining the largest party in Wales and having one less seat than the SNP in Scotland, while losing many English council seats, mainly to the Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2007/election_2007/default.stm | title = Election 2007 | date =4 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May, [[Charles Clarke]] changed his position towards Brown, praising him publicly and denying that he was poised to challenge for the Labour leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.politics.co.uk/news/features/labour-leadership/clarke-rules-out-leadership-with-praise-brown-$472810.htm  | title = Clarke rules out leadership with praise for Brown | date =3 May 2007 | publisher=Politics.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' the following day, he claimed that he could get a sufficient number of nominations to stand for the Labour leadership, but that the Labour Party did not "have the appetite" for such a contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6627153.stm  | title = Clarke 'will not challenge Brown' | date =4 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Reid and John Hutton also announced their support for Brown, Reid going on to announce that he would be stepping down as Home Secretary upon the departure of Blair and Prescott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=700982007 | archive-url =https://archive.is/20120713205606/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=700982007 | dead-url =yes | archive-date =13 July 2012 | title =Reid gives Brown clear run to No 10 | date =6 May 2007 | work =[[Scotland on Sunday]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6629877.stm  | title = Reid to quit as home secretary | date =6 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the ''[[News of the World]]'' on 6 May, Blair said that while [[David Cameron]] had learned the tactics of opposition, Labour could still win the next General Election and that Brown had shown sound judgement in his steering of the economy, which was the way to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/blair_0605.shtml  | title = Tony Blair Writes Exclusively for the News of the World | author=Tony Blair | date =6 May 2007 | work =[[News of the World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May, in the last Prime Minister's Questions before Blair announced the vacancy for the Labour leadership, [[David Cameron]] described the Labour government as "like [[Living Dead|The Living Dead]]". Blair ignored Cameron's taunts regarding the possible chaos caused by interim arrangements for election of a new Labour leader and the upcoming resignation of John Reid from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6638569.stm | title =PMQs: The living dead clash | date = 9 May 2007| publisher=[[BBC News]]| first=Nick | last=Assinder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tony Blair asks Labour NEC to seek a new leader==
On 10 May Blair announced to the [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] Labour Party that he would stand down as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007, and that he would be requesting Labour's NEC to seek a new party leader. Shortly afterwards, [[John Prescott]] announced that he would stand down as Deputy Prime Minister on the same day and that he had written to the NEC to announce his resignation as party Deputy Leader. Labour's NEC met on 13 May to finalise a timetable for the handover, confirming that Blair would remain leader until a new leader was elected, and giving any potential candidates three active Parliament days in which to submit their papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6639945.stm | title =Blair will stand down on 27 June | date =10 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6642805.stm | title =Prescott to quit as deputy leader | date =10 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6633989.stm | title =Q&amp;A: Blair's exit plans | date =11 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown, Michael Meacher and John McDonnell held a joint policy debate in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=738472007 | title =Campaigning Brown offers vision of NHS | date =12 May 2007 | work =[[The Scotsman]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May, [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] and [[Michael Meacher]] delayed a decision over which one should run, describing their respective levels of support as "too close to call".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6642331.stm | title =Brown rivals delay bid decision | date =10 May 2007 | work=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed by ''[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]]'', John McDonnell stated that he could and would not support Michael Meacher, since he had voted with [[New Labour]] on many issues, and that it was a matter of them sitting down together to compare how many votes they had and decide a way forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.tni.org/detail_page.phtml?act_id=16809 | title =Challenging Brown from the Left? Meacher and McDonnell interviewed | author = Oscar Reyes | date =11 May 2007 | work =[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]] | publisher = [[Transnational Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May [[Michael Meacher]] declared that he would not be a candidate in the Labour leadership election, since he did not have enough MPs support to get onto the ballot paper, going on to say he would be backing [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] to get a left-wing candidate onto the ballot paper, though the possibility of this was still in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6652651.stm | title =Johnson doubts Brown challenger | date =15 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May, [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Peter Hain]] and [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[Harriet Harman]] both announced that they had more than the minimum necessary number of nominations to appear on the Ballot paper for the Deputy Leadership Election, claiming 47 and 44 nominations respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/deputyleader/story/0,,2076881,00.html | title =Hain and Harman claim places on deputy ballot | date =10 May 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=David | last=Hencke | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership elections==
As nominations opened on 15 May it became clear that Brown was well past the minimum requirement of nominations, with the support of around 282 MPs, while John McDonnell had only 27 nominations, still well short of the 45 required. In the Deputy Leadership Race, Harriet Harman, Hazel Blears, Peter Hain and Alan Johnson all had more than the minimum required nominations, with [[Jon Cruddas]] having 44 nominations and Hilary Benn 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKL1464496220070515 | title =McDonnell short for leadership race | date =15 May 2007 | agency =[[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May John McDonnell alleged that many of Brown's supporters were using wrecking tactics to ensure that the decision did not proceed to a ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2081121,00.html | title=Brown trying to prevent contest, claims McDonnell | date =16 May 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Hélène | last=Mulholland | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day Brown secured 308 nominations, to John McDonnell's 29; although nominations were to be open for another day there were insufficient undeclared MPs remaining for anyone except Gordon Brown to be on the ballot, meaning he need only attend [[husting]]s and wait to be declared leader by the NEC. At this stage John McDonnell conceded defeat. In the Deputy Leadership Race, Jon Cruddas and Hilary Benn secured the required nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6660565.stm | title =Brown will enter No 10 unopposed | date =16 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6663653.stm | title =Deputy hopefuls make their case | date =16 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nominations closed on 17 May, with Brown having secured 313 nominations compared to John McDonnell's 29. [[Harriet Harman]] (65 nominations), [[Hazel Blears]] (49 nominations), [[Peter Hain]] (51 nominations), [[Alan Johnson]] (73 nominations), [[Jon Cruddas]] (49 nominations) and [[Hilary Benn]] (47 nominations) all qualified to appear on the Deputy leadership ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6457597.stm | title =Labour leader election timetable | date =9 May 2007 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.labour.org.uk/leadership/nominations_close_-_1230_thursday_17_may | title =Labour leadership, close of nominations | date =17 May 2007 | work =[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] website | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070921050327/http://www.labour.org.uk/leadership/nominations_close_-_1230_thursday_17_may | archivedate =21 September 2007 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the husting at the [[University of Warwick]] on 20 May, Brown was heckled regarding the [[Iraq War|2003 War in Iraq]]. He replied by saying that although there had been mistakes, it had been the right thing to do. Candidates for the Deputy Leadership election were asked which factors they considered important to the next General Election. Jon Cruddas named the issue of insecurity at work; Hilary Benn said that more housing was needed; Peter Hain described inequality as "the biggest challenge we face as a government"; Alan Johnson focused on social mobility; Hazel Blears mentioned education and employment opportunities; Harriet Harman said that Labour needed to "win back the trust and the confidence of the British people" and emphasised the importance of policy implementation. Blears, Harman and Benn all focused on the importance of party unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.labour.org.uk/leadership/hustings | title =Leadership Contest hustings | work =[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] website }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6673719.stm | title =Iraq decision was right – Brown | date=20 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Bradford husting on 27 May, [[Jan Wilson]], leader of [[Sheffield City Council]], told Gordon Brown that the shadow of Iraq hung over the party and that Brown had had an easy time on it during the leadership campaign. Brown said he was happy to discuss the decision to remove the Ba'athist regime, but that his priority now was to focus on the next steps, with numbers of UK troops decreasing and UK forces taking an "overwatch role".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6696993.stm | title =Brown warned on 'shadow' of Iraq | date=27 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the BAME ([[Black people|black]], [[British Asian|Asian]] and [[Minority group|minority ethnic]]) husting in [[Leicester]] on 30 May, Deputy Leadership candidates were split on the question of whether there should be all-ethnic minority shortlists; Hazel Blears, Jon Cruddas and Peter Hain all backed the idea, to increase numbers of Black and Asian MPs. Alan Johnson said that shortlists could reflect a need for more ethnic minority MPs, but that he was not sure that all-minority shortlists were the answer, and Hilary Benn said that he was not persuaded of the case for such shortlists either. [[Harriet Harman]] made no comment on the issue, except to say that there needed to be more MPs from ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6706499.stm | title =MP shortlists divide candidates | date=31 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June, ballot papers were sent out to Labour MPs, Labour MEPs, Labour Party members and members of affiliated unions for the position of Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6457597.stm | title = Labour leader election timetable| date =14 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Cardiff]] husting on 9 June, Brown described the Conservatives as caught between "what they think they should say" and "what they really believe". He accused them of being obsessed with [[Grammar school]]s, and said that parts of the Conservative Party wanted to scrap the [[National Health Service|NHS]].  He associated himself with decisions taken over the war in Iraq again, saying again that although mistakes had been made it had been the right thing to do. He also pledged that if necessary he would find more money to prevent job losses at [[Remploy]], a provider of jobs for the disabled, and that promises made at the G8 summit to tackle [[poverty in Africa]] would be kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6737257.stm | title =Brown taunts Tories over grammars | date=9 June 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Oxford]] Youth husting (for people under the age of 27) on 10 June, Gordon Brown said that Labour must modernise and reform again to further involve young people in decision making, including the use of online facilities such as MySpace. Hilary Benn was critical of [[Bob Geldof]] and defended the settlement of the recent G8 Summit in Germany, while Hazel Blears focused on anti-social behaviour. Peter Hain accused [[Home Secretary]] John Reid of "fanning up" the previous week's debate over possible introduction of new stop and search powers for police, saying "I don't believe in macho posturing on law and order and terrorism". Harriet Harman said that she felt the law needed changing to ensure that the government was informed if terrorist suspects en route to other countries faced the possibility of torture on arrival, and Jon Cruddas focused heavily on allegations of [[Extraordinary rendition|special rendition]] of terrorist suspects to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].  Alan Johnson stated the need for testing in schools to assess how well schools and individual pupils were doing; Jon Cruddas agreed but said he felt that it had gone too far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6738823.stm | title =Brown says Labour must modernise | date=10 June 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deputy Leadership Ballot closed at 17:00 UTC+1 on 22 June. Brown was declared leader at a special conference on 24 June, while in an election on the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] system, [[Harriet Harman]] won the Deputy Leadership by 50.4% to [[Alan Johnson]]'s 49.6% after preferences were re-distributed, Jon Cruddas coming narrowly third. Harman had been behind until the last round of redistributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6234692.stm | title =Harman wins deputy leader contest | date=24 June 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/deputyleader/story/0,,1974851,00.html | title = Deputy leadership contest: the rules explained| author =Hélène Mulholland | date =18 December 2006 | work = [[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to Prime Minister Gordon Brown==
[[Tony Blair]] tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to the Queen on 27 June 2007 and [[Gordon Brown]] was asked by the Queen to form a new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6245682.stm | title =Brown is UK's new prime minister | publisher =BBC News | date=27 June 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Blair with [[John Prescott]], Brown opted to keep his new deputy, [[Harriet Harman]], out of the position of [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].

'''Antonio Santiago Rodríguez'''{{efn|{{Spanish name|Santiago|Rodríguez|plain=yes}}}} (born March 9, 1950) — better known as '''Tony the Marine''' or as '''Tony Santiago''' — is a [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] [[veteran]], writer, and military historian from [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], focused mostly on the [[military history of Puerto Rico]] and its service members.&lt;ref name="anso"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318022500/http://www.ansomil.org/node/29|url=http://www.ansomil.org/node/29|title=Tony "the Marine" Santiago becomes official ANSO Historian|publisher=Association of Naval Services Officers|date={{date|2008-03-16|mdy}}|archivedate={{date|2012-03-18|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his work, Santiago was recognized by the [[23rd Senate of Puerto Rico]] for being "one of the main contributors of content related to Puerto Rico in the open online encyclopedia known as Wikipedia".&lt;ref name="sr3603"&gt;[http://www.oslpr.org/files/docs/{01BAB82E-1A7A-4EC4-A081-5F5E03747D62}.doc ''Senate Resolution #3603.''] Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico). 15th Legislative Assembly. 4th Extraordinary Session.

Retrieved 22 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate also recognized him as one of the main writers on subjects which relate to Puerto Rico, and an important historian of the Puerto Rican military experience.&lt;ref name="sr3603"/&gt; According to [[Wikimedia Foundation#Board of Trustees|Phoebe Ayers]], member of the [[Wikimedia Foundation|Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation]], this may be the first time that [[English Wikipedia]] has been mentioned in a parliamentary or congressional resolution of this type. She also stated that it's probably the first time that contributions to English Wikipedia have been cited in a formal governmental award, too.&lt;ref name="lists.wikimedia.org"&gt;[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-December/086887.html &amp;#91;WikiEN-l&amp;#93; User honored by the Senate of Puerto Rico]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Santiago was born in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] to Joaquín Santiago and Hilda Rodríguez-Mattei, both of Puerto Rican origin.&lt;ref&gt;"The Arizona Republic"; "A medal, a debt, both of honor"; by "azrepublic_Faherty_20070527.&lt;/ref&gt; Santiago graduated from [[high school]] in New York City and after being accepted to [[Columbia University]], Santiago chose to serve in the U.S. [[Marine Corps]] instead.&lt;ref name="alliance"/&gt;

==Military service==
[[File:Marine 69-71a.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Tony Santiago in Vietnam.]] 
Santiago served with the [[2nd Battalion 9th Marines]], [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] in the [[Vietnam War]] in the 81 MM Mortar, and later in the [[Military Police]] as well.&lt;ref name="alliance"/&gt;

While in the Marines (hence his nickname), Santiago perceived significant ethnic, racial, and national origin discrimination. In response to this, he formed an organization composed of American soldiers of Latino descent. The organization, named Latin Power in Unity, included soldiers of Puerto Rican, Mexican, Central American and other Latino backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elboricua.com/TonyTheMarine.html ''El Boricua,'' Boricua Publications, Ivonne Figueroa, ed.

Santiago also developed a close friendship with Leroy Reese &lt;ref name="PRGGH"/&gt;{{self-published-inline|date=May 2014}} who had formed a similar organization named "Black Power" for Black soldiers. Both men worked closely for the equal treatment of minorities and to improve relations between their members and the members of other ethnic groups in their company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Terry|last=Wallace|title=Bloods: Black Veterans of the Vietnam War.|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|year=1985|isbn=9780345311979}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2014}} An interview about Santiago’s experience in the military, collectively made by author Greg Boudonek and Santiago himself, was published in the book "Puertorriquenos Who Served With Guts, Glory, and Honor: Fighting to Defend a Nation Not Completely Their Own".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Puertorriquenos Who Served With Guts, Glory, and Honor: Fighting to Defend a Nation Not Completely Their Own|first=Greg|last=Boudonek|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|pages=140–147|isbn=978-1497352568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon finishing his [[Military deployment|tour]] with the U.S. Marine Corps in 1975, Santiago enrolled at the [[Interamerican University]] in [[Bayamon, Puerto Rico]]. He graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' with a degree in Business Administration in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Dean's List: 1978-1979|page=608|publisher=International Communications, Inc.|year=1979|isbn=9780915130252}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Puerto Rico, he met Milagros, the woman that would become his wife. They married in 1971 and had three children together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchinglovestories.com/marine-and-girl-next-door.htm|title=Real Life Love Stories: The Marine and the Girl Next Door|website=TouchingLives.com|year=2012|first=Tony|last=Santiago|authorlink=Tony Santiago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military historian==
[[Image:Tony and Clintons2.jpg|right|thumb|275px|(L-R) [[Puerto Rico Senate|President of the Puerto Rican Senate]] [[Kenneth McClintock]], [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]], Antonio, Milagros, Chelsea Clinton and former [[President of the United States|President of the U.S.]] [[Bill Clinton]]]]
In 1990, Santiago moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], with his wife and children. At this point he reflected, "the only [[role model]]s and heroes for Latino children were [[Zorro|El Zorro]], the [[Cisco Kid]] and [[Speedy Gonzales]] and," he said, "school textbooks failed to mention the many contributions that [[Latinos]] had made to the formation of our country [the United States]."&lt;ref name="alliance"/&gt;

In response, Santiago began publishing a series of short articles about the contributions that Puerto Ricans had made to the American society. He is the editor of the Puerto Rican Military History Channel of the monthly internet magazine "El Boricua",&lt;ref name="anso"/&gt; a staff writer in the internet magazine "Somos Primos"&lt;ref name="anso"/&gt; and the official historian of the [[Association of Naval Services Officers]] (ANSO).&lt;ref name="alliance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0129phx-town0130.html|title=Author Details Contributions of Puerto Ricans|first=Alison|last=Stanton|website=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date={{date|29-01-2008|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early published work focused on military history, but later he expanded his research and documentation to include many other facets of the Puerto Rican life experience.&lt;ref name="alliance"/&gt;
[[File:Tony with Representatives2.jpg|270px|thumb|left|Members of the Puerto Rican Senate recognize Tony (The Marine) Santiago]]
One email received from a reader of his articles led to Santiago serving to bridge two families that had lost track of each other for many years. It happened in 2007, when Santiago united U.S. Army veteran William W. Kouts with the family of the late David M. Gonzalez. Gonzalez had sacrificed his life to save Kouts during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elboricua.com/TonyMarineGonzalez.pdf|title=The David M. Gonzalez – William Kouts Story|website=El Boricua|year=2007|first=Tony|last=Santiago|authorlink=Tony Santiago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2010, Santiago discovered and wrote about Lt. [[Augusto Rodriguez (soldier)|Augusto Rodriguez]] a Puerto Rican who served in the [[American Civil War]]. It was the first time that a link in the American Civil War was made between Puerto Rico and the United States. Rodriguez was thus the first known Puerto Rican veteran of the United States Armed Forces. The significance of this discovery is that, until then, it was believed that Puerto Ricans had not served in the United States military prior to World War I.&lt;ref name="mcclintock-statement-remarks"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/kenneth-d-mcclintock/mensaje-d%C3%ADa-del-veterano-guánica-2013/10151716515001338|title=Mensaje día del Veterano Guánica 2013|first=Kenneth|last=McClintock|authorlink=Kenneth McClintock|date={{date|11-11-2013|mdy}}|publisher=[[Facebook|Speech by Secretary of State of Puerto Rico Kenneth McClintock posted in Facebook]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noticel.com/noticia/151279/descubren-veterano-puertorriqueno-que-sirvio-en-la-guerra-civil.html|title=Descubren veterano puertorriqueño que sirvió en la Guerra Civil|first=Eva|last=Laureano|website=NotiCel|language=Spanish|date={{date|11-11-2013|mdy}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto Rico's [[Secretary of State of Puerto Rico|Secretary of State]], [[Kenneth D.

Santiago is among the people who were interviewed and who are featured in the documentary “On Two Fronts: Latinos &amp; Vietnam”; directed and produced by Los Angeles-based filmmaker Mylene Moreno. The documentary, which aired on [[PBS]] in September 22, 2015, examines the Latino experience during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ontwofrontsmovie.com/ On Two Fronts Movie]&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed, together with fellow veteran Oscar Urrea, by PBS "Horizante" host Jose Cardenas and [[Univision]] newscaster Jorge Valenzuela, where he expressed his personal experiences, prior to the showing of the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azpbs.org/horizonte/detailvid.php?id=1245 Horizonte]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==
In addition to his military history research and writing, Santiago is also a [[free lance]] photojournalist for [[The Arizona Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/20130117phoenix-historic-buildings-prog.html|title=Phoenix’s Historic Buildings|website=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date={{date|05-02-2014|mdy}}|first=Lisa|last=DeForest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/20130411scottsdale-historic-preservation-homes-buildings-prog.html|title=See Scottsdale’s Historic Buildings and Homes|first=Lisa|last=DeForest|website=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date={{date|11-10-2014|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a member of the national steering committee of "Borinqueneers Congressional Gold Medal Alliance," which sought the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] for Puerto Rico's [[65th Infantry Regiment (United States)|65th Infantry Regiment]], and serves in the "Latino Alliance Advisory Board."&lt;ref name="alliance"&gt;[http://www.latinoalliance.net/tony-the-marine.html ''Latino Alliance Champion of Character: Former gang leader &amp; Vietnam vet chronicles Latino achievement, heroism, and leadership! - Tony "The Marine" Santiago''] Latino Alliance.

'''Toy theater''', also called '''paper theater''' and '''model theater''' (also spelt '''theatre''', see [[British and American spelling differences|spelling differences]]), is a form of miniature theater dating back to the early 19th century in Europe. Toy theaters were often printed on [[paperboard]] sheets and sold as kits at the [[concession stand]] of an [[opera house]], [[Theater (structure)|playhouse]], or [[vaudeville|vaudeville theater]]. Toy theaters were assembled at home and performed for family members and guests, sometimes with live musical accompaniment. Toy theater saw a drastic decline in popularity with a shift towards [[realism (theatre)|realism]] on the European stage in the late 19th century, and again  with the arrival of [[television]] after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, John. "A Short Entertaining History of Toy Theater." Cambridge: Great Small Works, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Toy theater has seen a resurgence in recent years among many [[puppeteer]]s, [[author]]s and [[filmmaker]]s and there are numerous international toy theater festivals throughout the Americas and Europe.

==History==
===Late 18th and early 19th century===
The original toy theaters were mass-produced replicas of popular plays, sold as kits that people assembled at home, including stage, scenery, characters and costumes. They were printed on paperboard, available at English playhouses and commercial libraries for "a penny plain or two pence coloured." Hobbyists often went to great pains to not only hand-color their stages, but to embellish their toy theater personae with bits of cloth and tinsel. Just as the toy-sized stages diminished a play’s scale, their corresponding scripts tended to abridge the text, paring it down to key characters and lines for a shorter, less complicated presentation.

In the first half of the 19th century more than 300 of London’s most popular plays saw issue as toy theaters. Publishers sent artists to the playhouses of [[Georgian era|Georgian]] and early-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] London to record the scenery, costumes and dramatic attitudes of the greatest successes of the day. The theatre management often provided these artists with a free seat, as the toy theatre sheets were excellent free advertising.

===Late 19th and early 20th century===
Stage theater of the early 19th century had been based more on spectacle than on depth of plot or character, and these characteristics lent themselves effectively to the format of toy theater. Toward the end of the 19th century, European popular drama had shifted its preference to the trend of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], marking a dramaturgical swing toward psychological complexity, character motivation and settings utilizing ordinary three-dimensional scenic elements. This trend in stage theater did not make an easy conversion to its toy counterpart, and with the fanciful dramas of 50 years prior being out of fashion, the toy theaters that remained in print fell into obsolescence. 

Despite its fall in popularity, toy theater remained in the realm of influential artists who championed its resurgence. In 1884 British author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] wrote an essay in tribute of toy theater’s tiny grandeur entitled “Penny Plain, Twopence Coloured” in which he extolled the virtues of the dramas supplied by [[Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop|Pollock's]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spitalfieldslife.com/2009/12/17/penny-plain-tuppence-coloured/  Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop on the Spitalfields Life website - 17 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://craftsmanship.net/the-rise-and-fall-of-toy-theatre/ The Rise and Fall of Toy Theatre - Craftsmanship Magazine - 6 December 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Other children’s authors like [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]] also dabbled in toy theater, as did [[Oscar Wilde]]. The brothers [[Jack Butler Yeats|Jack]] and [[William Butler Yeats]] both used toy theaters as mock-ups for their work in art and stagecraft. In the 20th century toy theater became a tool for the [[avant-garde]], messed with by [[Futurism|Futurist]] founder [[F.T. Marienetti]] as well as [[Pablo Picasso]]. Film directors like [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Orson Welles]] would use toy theaters as staging grounds for their cinematic masterpieces, and [[Laurence Olivier]] even made a toy theater of his film version of ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'', mass-produced with a little paper cutout of himself in the starring role.  But after its second wave boom, toy theater fell into a second recession, replaced in the 1950s, by a different box in people’s sitting rooms that needed no live operator and whose sets, characters, stories and musical numbers were beamed in electronically from miles away to be projected on the glass of a cathode ray tube: [[television]].

===Late 20th and early 21st century===
[[File:GeniZepelin05.JPG|thumb|Ainé Adriana Martelli performing Gení y el Zepelin at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]
Toy theater has been enjoying a revival in recent decades. Collectors and traditionalists perform restored versions of Victorian plays while experimental puppeteers push the form’s limits, adapting the works of [[Isaac Babel]] and [[Italo Calvino]], as well as that of unsung storytellers, friends, neighbors, relatives, and themselves. Contemporary toy theater may utilize any available technology and cover any subject, and numerous international toy theater festivals occur regularly throughout the Americas and Europe, attracting many well-known actors, musicians and authors to their stages.

==Construction and format==
[[Mass-produced]] toy theaters are usually sold as printed sheets, either in black and white to be colored as desired, or as full-color images of the [[proscenium]], scenery, sets, props and characters. The sheets are pasted onto thin [[Paperboard|cardboard]], cut out, and then assembled for the purposes of the reenacting of a play. Figures are attached to small sticks, wires, or configurations of strings that allow them to move about the set. Some toy theaters and figures are enhanced with moving parts and special effects, and it is common for performances to include live or pre-recorded sound effects and music.

==In modern media==

'''Transnational citizenship''' redefines traditional notions of [[citizenship]] and replaces an individual's singular national loyalties with the ability to belong to multiple [[nation state]]s, as made visible in the political, cultural, social and economic realms. Unlike national citizenship, where individuals interact in such capacities with one [[sovereign state]], transnational citizenship transcends pre-established territorial boundaries in order to create a modern meaning of "belonging" in an increasingly globalized society. Additionally, while preconceived notions of citizenship are often divided between national, social and individual forms of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], all three categories serve to contribute to the meaning of transnational citizenship. State citizenship can be defined as an individual establishing their sense of belonging by espousing to the liberal-democratic values of the state in the public sphere. When applied to transnational citizenship, an individual would have the opportunity to be civically engaged in multiple societies. A Dominican politician who lives in [[Santo Domingo]] yet canvasses in a highly dense [[Dominican American]] population in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] for external votes is an example of a transnational citizens functioning politically between two states.

In terms of the categories of social and individual forms of belonging, transnational citizens are marked by multiple identities and allegiances, and often travel between two or more countries, all in which they have created sizeable networks of differing functions. Similar to global or cosmopolitan citizenship, it is composed of cross-national and multi-layered memberships to certain societies. Transnational citizenship is based on the idea that a new global framework consistent of subgroups of national identities will eventually replace membership to one sole nation-state. In a hyper-realized version of transnational citizenship, "states become intermediaries between the local and the global." Institutionalizing transnational citizenship would loosen ties between territories and citizenship and would ultimately result in a reconstruction of [[world government|world order]] that forever changes the capacity in which individuals interact with [[government institution]]s.

==History and causes==

While some relate transnational citizenship to any historic shift or fusion of identities within nation-states, modern conceptions of the term have only surfaced in the past twenty years. Many attribute the evolution of the term to the rising situation of [[globalization]]. Globalization is defined by a heightened international access to the world [[capital market]] system and increased abilities to more rapid forms of [[communication]]. Due to the convenience and ease of modern international exchanges, globalization has become the process by which international economies as well as individuals interact with one another. Since post-[[Cold War]] 1989, the evolved "global political economy" has resulted in massive "reconfigurations of the world's arenas". Globalization transformed a confined [[geo-political]] system into one that relies heavily on multiple levels of local, national and global interactions. For example, [[China]]'s [[industrialization]] from an [[Agrarian society|agricultural society]] to a [[manufacturing]] society chronicled by excessive imports and exports contribute to a need to interconnect societies from all corners of the globe. The wealth that private institutions experienced from globalization resulted in "further extensions of [[corporation]]s in search of faraway resources and markets".

Beyond resulting in substantial political and economical shifts, globalization has also affected social and cultural practices between people. According to citizenship scholars like Andrew Vandenberg, such acts of globalization eventually "ended the constraints of space and time that conditioned all earlier human transactions, practices, and therefore identities. With the growth and distribution of [[technology]], more people all over the world have come to establish personal relationships with one another. Former state-regulated formal encounters are now replaced by modern informal and all the more frequent interactions. Rapid world [[economic growth]] has consequently led to [[Human migration|international migrations]]. In recent years, in conjunction with globalization, increased instances of uncontrolled and predominantly illegal international migrations contribute to opportunities for escalating transnational identities. Because obvious ties surface between [[immigrant]]s, their home countries, and the receiving countries, the civic ramifications are widespread. Thus international immigration contributes to loosening individual state ties. Once in their host countries, immigrants form [[social network]]s while maintaining ties to their homeland. Some organizations function in both countries, which serves to further enhance the notion that international migrants act as transnational citizens in multiple lands.

==V. multiculturalism==

It is important to draw a distinction between transnational citizenship and [[multiculturalism]] among national citizens. While transnational citizens bring cultural and societal elements of their home countries to their host countries and vice versa, multiculturalism results from the fusion of differing [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] or [[indigenous people]]s on a micro scale of a particular local environment. These interactions are described as "crosscutting and always mutually situational identifications." Therefore, ethnic minorities and majorities alike intermingle in a mutually shared space. All different types of individuals function within the same system, and eventually collective national identities are formed. On the other hand, transnational citizens live within the context of two or more societies that differ in size, scope, populations, laws, morals, and cultural codes. While transnational citizens interact with those already present in each respective community, they are functioning within divergent spaces. They base their interactions more on the need to reconcile two completely diverse localities into a greater context that traverses international borders, politics, and ways of life.

==The European Union as a test case==

"The question for the future of citizenship is whether a 'global' citizenship can transcend citizenships defined by 'local' stages on the basis of blood and birth through an act of the state itself." — Henry Teune

Some scholars consider the creation of the [[European Union]] as the pilot case for testing Teune's question about whether or not transnational citizenship can surpass national citizenship. Starting in the early 1980s, European national migration control officials met and established a consensus over the relationship between migration, [[right of asylum|asylum]] and [[crime]]. The control officials deemed migration as a security issue, and called for a "[[multi-level governance]]" in order to control migratory practices. Virginie Guiraudon generates the theory of "venue-shopping" in order to describe how cross-national policies prevailed. Venue-shopping is the process by which political members seek out specific governmental settings in order to establish their ideal policy outcomes. Political actors circumvented national levels of control in order to establish a "transnational cooperation" among nation-states. Starting in 1981, citizens with [[passport]]s from European countries were able to move freely across borders into other European countries. Due to the increased ease of traversing borders, the "[[Europeanization]]" of individuals began to occur in which a new transnational identity could be conceived.

The creation of the European Union only accelerated growing notions of transnational citizenship across the continent. The European Union came into being on November 1, 1993, when European nations signed the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] into law. The treaty established "community policy" in six new areas, one of which is termed "trans-European networks." The treaty also discusses the specific effects of the merger on a new formation of [[European citizen]]ship. The benefits of European citizenship include the ability for citizens to freely cross borders into and subsequently reside in other European countries, the right to vote in elections and run for office in both municipal and [[European elections]] in the state in which the citizen resides, the right to access any member country's diplomatic or consular services in a third-party country in which the citizen's birth nation is not represented, and the citizen's right to petition to the [[European parliament]]. The treaty thus instituted "European citizenship over and above national citizenship". This ultimately facilitates a new form of "European identity" that allows for members of the European Union to function as transnational actors beyond their countries' borders, establishing the entire continent as one cohesive entity.

Finally, the creation of the [[Euro (currency)|euro]] serves as the pinnacle of Europe's newfound economic unification. On January 1, 1999, the euro replaced the pre-existing currency in 11 European countries. The Treaty of Maastricht also created the [[European System of Central Banks]], which consists of the Central European Bank and national [[central bank]]s working together to establish monetary policy across participating countries. Some scholars consider the act of unifying the currency as "culminating the progress toward economic and monetary union in Europe". While the aspect of [[monetary union]] is clear, the far-reaching effects of [[economic union]] between countries could be considered a cause for debate. Regardless, the euro allows for transnational citizens of the European Union to not only move freely across borders, but also to experience easier monetary exchanges through the ability to use a currency that is present in both the citizens' home and host countries. The political, economic, and social ramifications that result from the invention of the European Union help contribute to the construction of European citizens as the international model for transnational citizenship.
