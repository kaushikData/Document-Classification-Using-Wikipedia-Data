And if hundreds young men which he has brought up at school, always considered as its spiritual instructor, how the writer, it became the spiritual instructor for all Chechen people.

Time of the beginning of creative activity of Aydamirov has coincided with the period of high hopes on changes in a country life in connection with condemnation of a cult of personality of [[Joseph Stalin]].

==Writings==
His first story was published in 1957. Aydamirov always wrote the truth about a life of the people that its products – hoary antiquity or problems of today concerned. Also there were times when the writer for a long time got to disgrace. Because no means always its creativity satisfied to ideological installations of time. Though it is invariable a feather of Aydamirov the dream of revival of a peace, creative life of the Chechen people moved.

Thus the writer in the products essentially condemned bloodshed, reminded readers a precept of the Chechen wise man – sacred [[Kunta-haji]]: never to solve any problems in arms. It till last days the life made all efforts to ward off disaster from a native land. Empathizing sufferings of the Chechen people, Aydamirov executed all life literary and a civic duty: wrote prose, publicism, gave interview. Aydamirov called for the civilised decision of any questions, struggled for culture of the world. At it is a lot of adherents. To its voice the Chechen people listened.

'''Adam Aristotle Starchild''', born '''Malcolm Willis McConahy''', (20 September 1946 – 22 September 2006) was a financial consultant, convicted fraudster, key figure in the "[[perpetual traveler]]" movement, and prolific author of books relating to investment, taxation, and the "offshore" world.

==Early life==
Malcolm Willis McConahy was born in [[Minnesota]]&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s29IAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LloDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2678%2C3942326 "Starchild is mystery figure in Kelly case"], Lucy Morgan, ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', 13 May 1980, Section B.&lt;/ref&gt; on 20 September 1946.&lt;ref name=scouts&gt;[http://documents.latimes.com/malcolm-willis-mcconahy/] [https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/471954/1051.pdf Malcolm Willis McConahy files Boy Scouts of America.] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing more is known of his youth but he later changed his name to Adam Aristotle Starchild, explaining on his website that Starchild was "a common [[Plains Cree]] name, found in usage across western Canada" indicating that he might have been of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] descent. He also claimed to be a former chairman of the [[Confederation of American Indians]].&lt;ref name=starch/&gt;

==Scouting==
Between February and July 1965, McConahy was an assistant scout master with Troop 27 in Minneapolis, a troop sponsored by Plymouth Congregational Church of that city, but was suspended after admitting homosexual interest in boys in the troop. Scouting records state that his personal and family church relationship was with Joyce Methodist Church. At the time he was operating a travel business in Minneapolis.&lt;ref name=scouts/&gt;

In July 1965, McConahy was arrested in Wisconsin for circulating pornographic material. He was travelling to New York to take up residence there and was in the company of four boys to whom he had given money.&lt;ref name=scouts/&gt;

In 1966, he moved to Milwaukee where he applied in February to be a college reserve scouter. His application stated that he was studying at Blackstone School of Law, to graduate in December 1968. The application was rejected by the National Council of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] who were aware of his scouting background in Minneapolis.&lt;ref name=scouts/&gt; In 1967 he was convicted of possessing obscene literature and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. In 1968 he was arrested for his involvement with a 16-year-old.&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt;

==First frauds==
In 1968, McConahy was convicted for a $57,000 cheque fraud in which he tried to dupe ten different banks. He was running a travel agency, Creative Travel Inc., at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HwMqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CygEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2256%2C926775 "Check Fraud Charge Leads to Indictment"] ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]'', 12 September 1968, p. 1. Google News. Retrieved 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zkUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sBAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2833%2C3995790 "Man Found Guilty of Mail Fraud"] ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]'', 20 November 1968, p. 8. Google News. Retrieved 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1969 he was sentenced to one year and one day in jail on three counts of mail fraud but failed to appear to start his sentence in April that year, resulting in the issue of a warrant for his arrest.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;

He travelled to England around 1970 where he was arrested by police and subsequently served four years in jail for forgery.&lt;ref name=Peters/&gt;&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt; In 1970, the U.S. [[Securities &amp; Exchange Commission]] placed securities thought to have been issued by McConahy on its Foreign Restricted List. These included "Bank Money Orders" in the name of J.P. Morgan &amp; Company Ltd. of London (intended to be mistaken for ''the'' [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.|J.P. Morgan]]) in an amount exceeding $375,000 which had been mailed to 31 [[savings and loan association]]s in California and a bank in Minnesota in order to open new accounts against which withdrawals were then attempted, and documents labelled "Negotiable Certificate of Deposit", also of J.P. Morgan &amp; Company Ltd. of London, which had been circulated in the United States. Advertisements had been placed in U.S. newspapers offering for sale joint venture interests by Swiss Caribbean Development &amp; Finance Corporation of Zurich, and [[certificates of deposit]] issued by Trust Company of Jamaica Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/1970/dig091770.pdf "Commission Announcement: Foreign Restricted List."] ''Securities &amp; Exchange Commission News Digest'', No. 70-181, 17 September 1970. [https://www.webcitation.org/6XkrRdSK7?url=https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/1970/dig091770.pdf Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; After being released from prison in the U.K., McConahy was extradited to the United States where he was arrested by U.S. Marshalls in February 1974 after he stepped off the plane in New York.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt; He was charged with unlawful flight and bail jumping and extradited to Wisconsin where he was convicted and sentenced to an additional one-year and one day in prison. He began his sentence in Sandstone, Minnesota, in May 1974 and was released in July that year.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;[http://www.andersonadvocates.com/documents/Perp_IV_Files_(MN)/Malcolm%20Willis%20McConahy%20Bio.pdf Malcolm Willis McConahy.] Jeff Anderson &amp; Associates, 2013. Retrieved 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;

In September 1974 he appeared in court in Trenton N.J., asking to be declared indigent so that he would not have to pay fees required as part of the process of recovering the charters of three Panamanian mutual funds that had been seized by British police. He claimed their loss had cost him $855,000.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;

==Adam Starchild==
Around 1975 or 1976, McConahy changed his name to Adam Aristotle Starchild. In February 1976 a photograph of him as Adam Starchild appeared in the gay newspaper ''The Advocate'' by that name. The paper reported that Starchild, an "openly gay business consultant" of West Hudson Business Service, Kearny N.J., had received a Presidential Sports Award from Gerald Ford for his canoe expeditions through the [[Boundary Waters|Quetico-Superior]] wilderness area of Minnesota and Ontario.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;

On 4 March 1976 an obituary appeared in the ''Kearny Observer'' as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Malcolm McConahy, of 325 Maple St., was killed in an auto accident in Minneapolis, Minn. while visiting relatives. McConahy was the sales manager for the West Hudson Business Service and recently opened his own consulting firm, McConahy Associates. He is survived by a brother in Tennessee.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May 1976, he appeared in Bergen County courthouse seeking dismissal of a lawsuit he had filed one year earlier against his mother.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;

Starchild's writing career began at about the same time as he changed his name. He was prolific, writing on topics that broadly reflected his [[libertarian]], anti-tax, anti-government attitudes. He often used publishers who specialised in producing works of a similar nature, such as [[Loompanics Unlimited]], [[Paladin Press]] and [[Scope International]]. Periods in the 1970s and 80s when he produced no books appear to tie-in with times when he was in prison.

In 1977, the ''[[Traverse City Record-Eagle]]'' reported that Starchild was involved in a number of supposed charitable organisations funded by a wealthy Michigander [[Francis Duffield Shelden]]: the ''Church of the New Revelation'' of Kearny, New Jersey, ''Brother Paul's Children's Mission'' on North Fox Island, Michigan, the ''Educational Foundation for Youth'' of Illinois, and the ''Ocean Living Institute'' of New Jersey - the last allegedly devoted to underwater habitats, aquaculture, ocean architecture, and ocean law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.mx/documents/undercurrents-10-march-april-1975.html "A life 'neath the ocean wave?"], ''Undercurrents 10'', Mar-April 1975, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; which were said to be tax dodges and fronts for sexual activity involving boys.&lt;ref name=mystery&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/55227410/ "Starchild a man of mystery"], Marilyn Wright, ''Traverse City Record-Eagle'', 16 December 1977, pp. 1 &amp; 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/55197497/ "Porno ring uses church, tax laws"], Marilyn Wright, ''Traverse City Record-Eagle'', 4 April 1977, p. 1 &amp; 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 Shelden fled to the Netherlands to escape impending charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leelanaunews.com/news/2014-03-06/Life_in_Leelanau/When_history_turns_out_not_so_nice.html When history turns out not so nice.] Kathleen Firestone, ''[[Leelanau Enterprise]]'', 6 March 2014. Retrieved 14 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; To protect his assets, he handed two million dollars in securities to Starchild, who had advised the creation of an offshore trust, with himself as trustee. However, Starchild neglected to provide proper accounting, or hand over the securities to the successor trustee, [[Edward Brongersma]], whom an increasingly worried Shelden appointed. Despite being an international fugitive, in 1983 Shelden managed to successfully take Starchild to court to reclaim the funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Bank of Detroit, Plaintiff, v.

==1980s==
In 1980, Starchild was linked by the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' to [[Richard Kelly (politician)|Richard Kelly]]'s involvement in the [[Abscam]] scandal through Starchild's relationship with Kelly's aide J.P. Maher III. According to Kelly, it was Maher who asked Starchild to handle a campaign mailing list through his firm Minerva Consulting Group Inc.&lt;ref name=Peters/&gt;

In 1986, he was convicted of [[mail fraud]], beginning his sentence on 25 September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/973/610/386406/ Adam Starchild, Appellant. v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, Appellee, 973 F.2d 610 (8th Cir. 1992).] Justia. Retrieved 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He was additionally convicted of tax fraud in 1989.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt; While incarcerated at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Ashland]], Starchild won third prize in the essay section of the Prison Writing Awards 1990-1991 for his essay, ''Rape as Punishment''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pen.org/literature/prison-writing-award-winners-1990-1991 Prison Writing Award Winners: 1990-1991.] [[PEN America]]. Retrieved 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He also had an article published in the ''[[Journal of Psychohistory]]'' in 1990, titled "Rape of youth in prisons and juvenile facilities" in which he compared and contrasted [[prison rape]] in the United States, Britain, Latin America, South Africa, and Turkey, finding that the phenomenon often exhibited cultural differences by region and country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1991-10974-001 APA PsycNET.] Retrieved 14 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s==
In 1992, after his release from prison, Starchild appealed his parole conditions that he must live and work in the United States for approximately five years on the grounds, among other things, that as a citizen of the Dominican Republic, he should have been allowed to return to his own country after the completion of his sentence. The [[Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] ruled in October 1992 that they did not have jurisdiction in the matter.&lt;ref name=lister&gt;[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/592770/adam-starchild-v-united-states-parole-commission/ Adam Starchild v. United States Parole Commission, 977 F.2d 586 (8th Cir. 1992) Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.] Court Listener. 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear when Starchild became a citizen of the Dominican Republic or whether he ever gave up his American citizenship.

Starchild became active on the internet, posting in [[Usenet]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/%22adam$20starchild%22 Search results for "Adam Starchild".] Google Groups. Retrieved 15 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and being described in an academic journal in 1998 as "an offshore finance proselytizer who is prominent on the World Wide Web, [who] encourages investors to dispense with what he views as ancient, irrational, primordial sentiments and attachments, and instead to embrace a late capitalist nomadism he terms "PT" ".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25691117 "Cyberspatial Sovereignties: Offshore Finance, Digital Cash, and the Limits of Liberalism"], Bill Maurer, ''[[Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies]]'', Vol. 5, No. 2 (Spring 1998), pp. 493-519.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Starchild was living in Panama, and sponsoring a university student in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Trip To Costa Rica|url = http://www.benbest.com/travel/costarica.html|website = www.benbest.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a client of [[Marc Harris]]'s Panama-based Harris Organisation.&lt;ref name=harris&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060525064731/http://www.offshorebusiness.com/Harris/harrisclients.PDF List of Harris Organisation Clients.] 3 September 2002. Quatloos! Retrieved 10 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Starchild died in Spain, on 22 September 2006. He had recently moved there from Panama as he felt that he would receive better medical care in Spain. Earlier in 2006 he had traveled to Japan for experimental surgery on a tumor and he wrote that his operation there had attracted the attention of the Japanese media. Starchild was survived by his partner Javier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freestudents.blogspot.co.uk/2006/09/sad-news.html The sad news.] ''Classically Liberal'', 22 September 2006.

'''Ahn Cheol-soo''' ({{ko-hhrm|안철수}} {{IPA-ko|an tɕʰʌl.s͈u|}}; born 26 February 1962) is a [[South Korea]]n politician, physician, and software entrepreneur. A two-time former presidential election candidate in [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|2012]] and [[South Korean presidential election, 2017|2017]], Ahn is currently the [[Bareunmirae Party]]'s candidate for the [[Seoul]] [[Mayor of Seoul|mayorship]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3046505|title=Ahn Cheol-soo declares bid for Seoul mayor|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He ran as an independent candidate for the [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|presidential election in 2012]], but withdrew a month before the election took place to support [[Moon Jae-in]] whom he ran against in 2017 as the [[People's Party (South Korea, 2016)|People's Party]] nominee. He was a founding co-leader and the party leader of the People's Party until his party and [[Bareun Party]] merged as [[Bareunmirae Party]] in February 2018. 

Prior to politics, Ahn founded [[AhnLab, Inc.]], an [[antivirus software]] company, in 1995. He was chairman of the board and [[Chief Learning Officer]] of AhnLab until September 2012, and remains the company's largest stakeholder. Prior to entering politics, Ahn served as dean of the Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology at [[Seoul National University]] until September 2012.

==Early life and education==
Ahn was born on 26 February 1962, in [[Miryang]], [[South Korea]], while his father was on military service there; he subsequently moved with his family to [[Busan]], where he grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/555525.html|title=The vetting of Ahn Cheol-soo|newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]]|date=12 October 2012|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn was not an academic child but had number academic hobbies such as reading.&lt;ref&gt;http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=109&amp;aid=0002032901&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his Doctor of Medicine (MD), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in [[physiology]] from [[Seoul National University]] between 1980 and 1991. He became the youngest chief of professors at [[Dankook University]] medical college at 27 years of age, marking his first career as a medical doctor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/09/113_94248.html|title=Who is Ahn Cheol-soo|date=2011-09-05|work=koreatimes|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahn met his wife whilst in university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.jkn.co.kr/article/news/20090618/3355840.htm|title=‘무릎팍도사’ 출연 안철수, “부인과는 유명한 캠퍼스 커플, 프러포즈는…”|last=재경일보|date=2009-06-18|work=재경일보|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst working as a graduate student pursuing his MD, Ahn began to gain an interest in computer software as a hobby, in particular, [[antivirus software]]. Ahn soon began working on his own antivirus software after he was confronted with a virus that was mass-infecting computers in Korea. Ahn was soon infected with the same virus and reverse engineered the virus in an attempt to erase it from his disk drive which was successful. The program he wrote to help get rid of the virus was eventually called "Vaccine"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=200906180048251001|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Ahn distributed for free.

== Business Career ==

=== AhnLab, Inc ===
After finishing military service as a medical officer in the [[Republic of Korea Navy|South Korean navy]], and leaving behind his career in the medical profession, Cheol-soo went on to establish his venture company [[AhnLab, Inc.|AhnLab, Inc]] in March 1995&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; after being advised by a software company official to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=029&amp;aid=0001985929|title=안철수 KAIST 교수, 17일 무릎팍 도사 출연|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn had previously attempted to distribute V3 via Samsung's brand though Samsung rejected Ahn's offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsnews.mk.co.kr/news/29862|title=안철수, 1000만 불 인수제의 거절한 이유!! {{!}} 아츠뉴스|website=artsnews.mk.co.kr|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ahn, not knowing how to run a business at first, struggled for the first several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=143&amp;aid=0001993990|title=‘무릎팍도사’ 안철수, 반쪽짜리 감동|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst managing the company, Ahn was also attempting to get a master's degree in engineering at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he graduated in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/society/201103/h2011031821075622020.htm|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn eventually received a $10 million offer from US software giant, [[McAfee]]&lt;ref&gt;민도식, 나를 확바꾸는 실천 독서법 북포스 155페이지 '1997년 직원들에게 안철수연구소를 맡겨둔채 미국에서 유학하며 실리콘벨리에 머물던 중 현재 경쟁회사 맥아피에게 1천만달러 제안 받았지만 거절'&lt;/ref&gt; and Ahn met with [[John McAfee]] personally. McAfee was struggling to expand into South Korea due to AhnLab, Inc and wanted to purchase the company in an attempt to monopolize the anti-virus software market in South Korea. Ahn rejected the offer because, despite the AhnLab, Inc struggling, selling the company would lead to widespread redundancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=015&amp;aid=0002085972|title='무릎팍도사' 출연 안철수, 온화한 카리스마로 시청자 압도|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hkn24.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=27942|title=무릎팍 안철수 “외국회사 1000만불 매각제의 단호히 거절” - 헬스코리아뉴스|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the company began to run a surplus after the CIH virus became widespread in Korea and people needed to buy V3 to protect against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=101&amp;oid=047&amp;aid=0001963116|title=안철수 "정치할 생각 있냐고요?"|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1999, AhnLab, Inc became the second biggest computer security company in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiatoday.co.kr/view.php?key=258456|title=‘무릎팍도사’ 출연 안철수, “한국의 빌게이츠(?)...너무 과분해”|work=종합일간지 : 신문/웹/모바일 등 멀티 채널로 국내외 실시간 뉴스와 수준 높은 정보를 제공|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same company later became the largest computer security company in South Korea,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2009/10/258_40800.html ''AhnLab Looks to Perform in International Stage''] at ''[[The Korea Times|Korea Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/5502/ahnlab-considers-overseas-ma ''AhnLab Considers Overseas M&amp;A''] at ''Korea IT Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/world/asia/new-voice-in-south-korean-politics-enters-presidential-race.html|title=New Voice in South Korean Politics, Ahn Cheol-soo, Enters Presidential Race|last=Gladstone|first=Rick|date=2012-09-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-29|last2=Lee|first2=Su-hyun|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was included in annual lists of Korea's most admired companies by Korea Management Association Consulting between 2004 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmac.co.kr/certify/certify_01a_1.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024034/http://www.kmac.co.kr/certify/certify_01a_1.asp |archivedate=2016-03-04 }} {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiae.co.kr/uhtml/read.php?idxno=2008022017371847343 ''AhnLab, "The Korea's Most Admired company" Consecutive 5 years''] at ''Asia Economy'' (2008.02.20). {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kr.ahnlab.com/company/eng/about/milestone.jsp|title=AhnLab|date=|publisher=Kr.ahnlab.com|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mk.co.kr/outside/view.php?year=2008&amp;no=92321 ''Samsung Electronics Most Admired Company in Korea: Survey''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723173328/http://news.mk.co.kr/outside/view.php?year=2008&amp;no=92321 |date=23 July 2011 }} at ''Maeil Business Newspaper'' &amp; mk.co.kr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/297104.html Book review "''세상에서 가장 안전한 이름 안철수 연구소''"] at ''[[The Hankyoreh]]''. {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned as CEO in 2005 and served as chairman of the board until 2012.

Ahn revealed that [[John McAfee]] once suggested it would acquire AhnLab for $10,000,000 but rejected the offer. He mentioned patriotic reasons about the decision saying that selling AhnLab might allow a foreign firm to dominate the Korean market.

=== Later life and education ===
Ahn became an outside director of [[POSCO]] in 2005, and from 2010 to 2011 was chairman of the company.

Ahn was awarded an Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA) degree from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]] (San Francisco campus) in 2008. He then became a professor at [[KAIST]] in 2008, and later in the beginning of 2011 became the Dean of the Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology at [[Seoul National University]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Political career==

===Entry into politics ===
Since 2006, Ahn had been offered places in the main political parties but was constantly denied any chance to run as an independent due to opposing factions.

In early September 2011, speculation spread that Ahn would enter politics by competing in the 26 October Seoul mayoral by-election. The Democratic Party and Liberty Korea Party attempted to recruit Ahn for the mayoral by-election though they failed due to Ahn feeling like he, and many other voters, had become disenfranchised with the main two choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imbc.com/broad/tv/culture/sisa2580/vod/index.html?kind=image&amp;progCode=1000845100520100000&amp;pagesize=5&amp;pagenum=1&amp;cornerFlag=1&amp;ContentTypeID=1&amp;ProgramGroupID=0|title=다시보기 {{!}} 시사매거진 2580|website=www.imbc.com|language=ko|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn eventually made an announcement, denouncing the opposition and ruling party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20110905n06506|title=안철수, "야권과 단일화 얼마든지 고려할 수 있다"|website=네이트뉴스|language=ko-KR|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saying he was not sure on his candidacy, deciding to watch the polls before making a choice though he shared the sentiment that he felt like it'd take a lot of work to help Seoul, saying "ten years of work" would be needed to help the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20110905n07503|title=안철수 "윤여준이 기획자? 그건 언론의 오보"|website=네이트뉴스|language=ko-KR|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts stated that if positioned as an independent, Ahn would attract a degree of support from those disaffected by mainstream political parties in the wake of corruption allegations and continuing policy failures. 

Ahn's polling was higher than other potential candidates, at 35% with second place coming in at 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20110905n02597|title=안철수, 서울시장 보선 여론조사서 압도적 선두|website=네이트뉴스|language=ko-KR|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His approval rating was subsequently polled afterwards, reaching over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mediatoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=97232|title=조국 "안철수에 큰박수" 진중권 "과연 인물"|last=미디어오늘|date=2011-09-06|work=미디어오늘|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn eventually didn't run despite his positive poll ratings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://v.media.daum.net/v/20110907084056110|title="아무 조건 없습니다" 안철수 깨끗한 양보|date=2011-09-07|work=다음 뉴스|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead endorsing [[Park Won-soon]] who went on to win the by-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://v.media.daum.net/v/20110907024716274|title=박원순, 안철수 지지율 흡수 여부가 변수|date=2011-09-07|work=다음 뉴스|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park's win has been attributed to Ahn's endorsement due to centrist voters moving to Park's side after the endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=032&amp;aid=0002162450|title=박원순 ‘안철수 지지’ 업고 나경원과 오차내 접전|access-date=2018-05-10|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He alluded to standing as a presidential candidate in his 2012 book ''Thoughts of Ahn Cheol-Soo''.&lt;ref name="Ahn Nominee"&gt;{{cite news|last=Yeong-doo|first=Kang|title=Ahn Cheol-soo to announce his candidancy virtually|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/politics/2012/07/19/0502000000AKR20120719102051001.HTML?template=5565|accessdate=19 July 2012 |newspaper=Yonhapnews |date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First presidential campaign (2012)===
On 19 September 2012, at 3 p.m. [[Korea Standard Time]], Ahn held a press conference and announced his intention to run for the [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]]. This announcement came after months of speculation on whether or not Ahn was going to run for the presidency. The South Korean presidential election was to be held on 19 December 2012. In an address that lasted around 20 minutes, Ahn spent a considerable amount of time explaining how he came to the decision to run for President of the Republic of Korea, quoting the people he had met while exploring his candidacy, who had expressed their desire for a "new politics". Ahn at one point showed to be polling stronger than [[Moon Jae-in]], with a few polls showing he could win against [[Park Geun-hye]], the candidate who would go on to win the election. On 23 November 2012, at 8:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. KST, Ahn announced that he would drop out of the race,&lt;ref&gt;http://news.naver.com/main/president2012/news/read.nhn?mid=hot&amp;sid1=154&amp;cid=909465&amp;iid=39207146&amp;oid=003&amp;aid=0004843794&amp;ptype=011&lt;/ref&gt; endorsing Moon Jae-in, the Democratic United Party presidential candidate.

===Early Assembly career (2013–2016)===
On 11 March 2013, Ahn announced that he would run for a seat in the [[National Assembly of South Korea]]  as an independent candidate in the by-election in the district of [[Seoul]] [[Nowon-gu|Nowon]] C. He won the election on 24 April, entering his first elected office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=전국 12개 재보선 개표 마무리…安·金·李 당선|url=http://news1.kr/articles/1105911|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=News1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, he launched a new think tank named Policy Network Tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=안철수 싱크탱크 출범, 신당 창당 궤도에 올라|url=http://www.newdaily.co.kr/news/article.html?no=155844|accessdate=25 May 2013|newspaper=Newdaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Politics Alliance for Democracy Chairmanship (2014) ====
Having entered the Assembly, Ahn began to explore the creation of a new party, which was provisionally named the New Political Vision Party on the basis of public surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2985037|title=Ahn’s party to establish new name at gathering|newspaper=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=17 February 2014|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 2014, however, while the party was in the process of being set up, Ahn merged his faction with the liberal Democratic Party to form the [[New Politics Alliance for Democracy]] (NPAD), becoming co-chairman of the new party alongside [[Kim Han-gil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2985728|title=Political shocker as DP, Ahn Cheol-soo merge|newspaper=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.donga.com/List/3/all/26/407931/1|title=Democratic Party, Ahn Cheol-soo agree to create new party|newspaper=[[The Dong-A Ilbo]]|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn and Kim both resigned from their position three months later in July following the new party's disappointing performance in [[South Korean by-elections, 2014|by-elections that year]], which had seen the liberals lose a seat in [[Jeolla]] to conservatives for the first time in 26 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2992867|title=Co-chairmen quit amid election rubble|newspaper=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Defection from the NPAD (2015) ====
Ahn remained in the NPAD, but came into increasing conflict with Moon Jae-in, who had taken over sole leadership of the party after his resignation, and the "pro-Roh" faction that Moon represented. In December 2015, Ahn issued an ultimatum to Moon demanding that a convention be held at the beginning of 2016 to elect a new party leader. Moon rejected the demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3012565|title=NPAD’s Moon rejects Ahn demand|newspaper=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=9 December 2015|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn then left the NPAD along with a range of other lawmakers opposed to Moon, including Kim Han-gil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/12/116_193056.html|title=Ahn Cheol-soo calls it quits with NPAD|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=13 December 2015|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announcing that he would form a new party, he subsequently joined forces with [[Chun Jung-bae]], who had left the party earlier in the year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150914001156|title=Party feud erodes Moon’s leadership|newspaper=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=14 September 2015|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form the [[People's Party (South Korea, 2016)|People's Party]] in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tbsefm.seoul.kr/eNews/news.do?method=efmNewsInfo&amp;idx_800=2143018&amp;typ_800=N |title=Ahn Cheol-Soo, Chun Jung-Bae To Create New Party |publisher=TBS eFM |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=12 April 2016}}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moon resigned as leader after Ahn's defection, describing his experience as "a series of difficult days without a single one of respite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/728307.html|title=Moon Jae-in steps down as leader of The Minjoo Party of Korea|newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]]|date=28 January 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Party (2016–2018)===
Ahn positioned the new [[People's Party (South Korea, 2016)|People's Party]] as an anti-establishment centrist force, attracting support from both political wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_201981.html|title=Ahn's popularity baffles parties|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He labeled the remaining NPAD "anachronistic progressives",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160118000971|title=Debate over first President Rhee reignites|newspaper=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=18 January 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accused contemporary Korean politicians of lacking policies beyond "short-term gimmicks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emanuel-pastreich/the-bernie-sanders-of-kor_b_9211944.html|title=The Bernie Sanders of Korea? An Interview With Ahn Cheol-soo|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=11 February 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead-up to the [[South Korean legislative election, 2016|April 13 parliamentary election]], he came into conflict with his co-leader Chun and other members of the party after [[Kim Chong-in]], the interim leader of the Democratic Party, the NPAD's successor, called for the two parties to form an electoral alliance. Kim Han-gil and Ahn's co-leader Chun both supported the plan, but Ahn rejected any prospect of an alliance with his former party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/03/116_199827.html|title=Ahn stumbling on internal feud|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=7 March 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was ultimately scotched, with Kim Han-gil withdrawing from the upcoming election in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/03/116_200609.html |title=Rep.

In the event, the People's Party performed better than anticipated, coming second in [[party-list proportional representation|party-list]] voting and winning 38 seats overall, including 23 of the 28 districts in the liberal stronghold of Jeolla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/739721.html|title=In liberal stronghold, voters give main opposition party a lashing|newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]]|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The People's Party held the balance of power in the new Assembly, establishing a [[multi-party system|three-party system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160413000614|title=Minority People's Party steals show: Ahn’s Party holds balance of power as three party system dawns|newspaper=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn was credited for the victory, which was seen as giving him a position as [[kingmaker]] and support for contesting [[South Korean presidential election, 2017|the presidential elections in the following year]].&lt;ref name="BloombergKingmaker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-14/software-tycoon-turns-political-kingmaker-in-korean-stalemate|title=Software Tycoon Turns Political Kingmaker in Korea Stalemate|publisher=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_202545.html|title=Attention to shift to 2017 presidential race|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=13 April 2016|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election, Ahn rejected continued calls to regroup with the Minjoo Party, stating that "it would be inappropriate to speak of politically realigning at this point in time". He added that the People's Party would not be "a mere tie-breaking third party, but ... a new opinion leader in parliamentary affairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160417000276|title=Ahn gestures at moving onto presidential race|newspaper=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=17 April 2016|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Second presidential campaign and defeat (2017) ====
Ahn was widely known to be a likely contender for the [[South Korean presidential election, 2017|2017 South Korean presidential election]]. He was selected as the People's Party's nominee,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/world/asia/south-korea-election-ahn-cheol-soo.html|title=South Korea Election Turns Into 2-Way Race as Dark Horse Surges|last=Sang-hun|first=Choe|date=2017-04-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-15|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; defeating [[Sohn Hak-kyu]] and [[Park Joo-sun]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=079&amp;aid=0003072580&lt;/ref&gt; Despite rapid increase in opinion polling which briefly bypassed [[Moon Jae-in|Moon Jae-In]], Ahn floundered in TV debates that led to his loss finishing third in a field of five total candidates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;'{{Cite news|url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0101_201705032206263984|title=Ahn And Hong Exchanges 2nd Place In Polling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Return of party chairmanship (2017-2018) ====
The underperformance of his presidential campaign and a party scandal that found People's Party members fabricating evidence to smear Moon Jae-in's campaign led Ahn to declare in July 2017 to both apologize and take a step back from politics in "self-reflection." He returned a month later to run, and later win, the party chairmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mengnews.joins.com/view.aspx?aId=3037660|title=Ahn Cheol-soo hails his comeback as People’s Party head|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bareunmirae Party (2018-present) ===
As head of the People's Party, Ahn was a strong advocate for merging with the center-right Bareun Party. The two leaders of the respective parties, Ahn and former presidential contender [[Yoo Seong-min|Yoo Seung-min]], pushed forward with the merger which was completed in February 2018. 

Although Yoo retained a leadership position within the new party and Ahn stepped down from any leadership role, as of March 2018 took on the role of leading the party's talent recruiting committee - a formal position speculated to signal his preparation to run for the Seoul mayorship later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180316000791|title=Parties ready for Seoul mayoral election|last=Herald|first=The Korea|date=2018-03-16|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Seoul Mayorship campaign (2018) ====

==Political positions==

=== "New Politics" ===
Ahn has stated that he considers [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to be a role model,&lt;ref name="BloombergKingmaker" /&gt; and has referred to himself as the [[Bernie Sanders]] of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emanuel-pastreich/the-bernie-sanders-of-kor_b_9211944.html|title=The Bernie Sanders of Korea? An Interview With Ahn Cheol-soo|newspaper=The World Post|date=11 February 2016|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports an increased [[capital gains tax]], higher public welfare spending, and a cautious approach to free trade agreements.&lt;ref name="BloombergKingmaker" /&gt;

=== Centrism ===
Ahn has also made appeals to conservatives, however, and has associated the People's Party with "reformative" currents of Korean conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_202138.html|title=Ahn backs Yoo to woo conservatives|newspaper=[[The Korea Times]]|date=7 April 2016|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, Ahn visited the graves of [[Syngman Rhee]], [[Park Chung-hee]], and [[Kim Dae-jung]]. Park and Rhee are often praised by Korean conservatives, and Kim by liberals. Ahn stated at the time that it would be "hypocritical to paint half the people as enemies and at the same time call for 'unity{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/552749.html|title=Ahn visits National Cemetery in first political act|newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]]|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn has been considered "more palatable for conservative voters" in part due to his business background.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== National security (THAAD) ===
Ahn was among the first who opposed the American deployment of the [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]] system, commonly referred to as THAAD, alongside Moon Jae-in. However, he changed his stance suggesting it was "irresponsible" for any future president to reverse an agreement already made between the United States and Korea.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== LGBT rights ===
Ahn has stated he opposes the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]], although in a more detailed article on broadcasting network SBS' website, he said that same-sex marriage needs to be achieved through social discussion.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Philanthropy==
In December 2011, Ahn has expressed his willingness to donate half of his shares in AhnLab for the education of children from low-income families. He owns 37.1 percent of AhnLab shares, and as of 9 December 2011, the value of the shares to be donated is about 250 billion won ($218 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Gwang-bin (광빈) |last = Lee (이) |script-title=ko:안철수 기부주식 2천500억원 넘어 |date = 2011-12-11 |url = http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2011/12/10/0200000000AKR20111210045600001.HTML |work = Yonhap News |accessdate = 2011-12-11 |language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal problems==
In September 2012, Ahn made a public apology as reports surfaced that his wife evaded taxes by under-pricing a 2001 apartment she bought worth ₩450 million to ₩250 million, thus reducing the acquisition and registration taxes by up to ₩10 million.  However, a statement by the Korea Taxpayers' Association claimed that the "down contract" was in accordance with trade customs and thus not unlawful due to flaws in the local tax law between 1996 and 2005.&lt;ref name="ahnkoreaherald"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bae |first=Hyun-jung |title=Ahn apologizes for wife's tax-dodging |newspaper=Korea Herald |publication-place=Seoul |date=28 September 2012 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1988 he married Kim Mi-kyung, who is currently a professor at the Seoul National University College of Medicine. Ahn has a daughter with Kim.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2012&amp;no=610838 {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11612">'''Anton Vyacheslavovich Krasovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Антóн Вячеслáвович Красóвский}}) (born 18 July 1975) is a Russian political journalist, television personality and gay rights activist.{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}

==Life and career==
Krasovsky was born on 18 July 1975 in [[Podolsk]] and studied at the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]].&lt;ref name="snob1"/&gt; In 2011 Krasovsky participated in the presidential campaign of [[Mikhail Prokhorov]].&lt;ref name="Prokhorov's campaign to be run by journalist Anton Krasovsky"/&gt; He also worked as a journalist and editor at the pro-[[Kremlin]]{{fact|date=March 2014}} [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]] channel.&lt;ref name=wc/&gt; He also worked at ''[[Kommersant]]'', ''[[Yandex]]'', ''[[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', and other publications.&lt;ref name="Following Paul Pubic NTV went with Anton Krasovsky"/&gt;

Krasovsky later began work at another pro-Kremlin{{fact|date=March 2014}} channel, [[Kontr TV]], started by himself and [[Sergey Minaev]] in December 2012.&lt;ref name=snob/&gt; On 25 January 2013, during a discussion of a proposed national [[LGBT rights in Russia#Bans on "homosexual propaganda"|ban on "homosexual propaganda"]], Krasovsky revealed his homosexuality, stating on-air, "I'm gay and I'm as much a human-being as Putin and Medvedev." ({{lang-ru|Я гей и такой же человек, как Путин и Медведев.|links=no}})&lt;ref name=snob/&gt; His statement was not made available online or was deleted soon afterwards,&lt;ref name=wc/&gt;&lt;ref name=dm/&gt;&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost/&gt; and on 28 January Krasovsky resigned from the channel and denounced the working environment there.&lt;ref name="snob"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lenta"/&gt; According to other sources, he was fired the same day.&lt;ref name="Russian anchor fired after coming out on live TV"/&gt; His face was soon censored from the show website and removed from the TV show's archives.&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost/&gt;

Krasovsky stated that he came out because he had enough feeling like a hypocrite.&lt;ref name=snob/&gt; He later referred to the channel's entire output as "propaganda."&lt;ref name="snob2"/&gt; In May, following the murder of [[Vlad Tornovy]] reportedly because he was thought to be gay,&lt;ref name="Arrests over 'anti-gay' murder in Volgograd Russia"/&gt; Krasovsky published an article in ''The Guardian'' denouncing homophobia in Russia. He wrote:&lt;ref name="I came out because gay people in Russia are suffering – it's time for courage"/&gt;
{{quote|How did it come about that today in Russia a good gay person is a dead gay person? How did there come to be a law in the Duma that forbids justifying homosexuality? Until now, the only thing you were forbidden to justify in my country was terrorism.... So as far as the deputies are concerned I am not a human being in the same sense that they are; I am to be classed as scum, like a terrorist. As far as the deputies are concerned I am scum by the fact of my birth, and it was criminal negligence not to have made a note of that in my birth certificate. What seemed like a bad dream only a couple of years ago has now become reality. And it is terrifying to imagine what could happen tomorrow.}}

Krasovsky spoke out in August 2013 against the [[Concerns and controversies at the 2014 Winter Olympics#Pride House and LGBT rights|boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics]] in Russia that some gay rights activists proposed. He said: "If you want to boycott Olympic games in Russia, you're trying to boycott 7 million gay people in Russia. You want to boycott me."&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost/&gt; He is interviewed about his experiences in the 2014 documentary film ''[[Campaign of Hate: Russia and Gay Propaganda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/movies/2014/05/16/russia-deadly-campaign|title=Russia's Deadly Campaign|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|date=2014-05-16|accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Anton Krasovsky and the head of the outpatient department of the Moscow Regional AIDS Center Elena Orlova-Morozova established The Foundation in support of people who live with HIV — [[AIDS.Center]].&lt;ref name="newizv2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://newizv.ru/news/society/06-10-2016/247659-zachem-nam-vashi-dengi-fond-spidcentr-prosit-o-pomoshi |title=Фонд «СПИД.ЦЕНТР» просит о финансовой помощи |trans-title = AIDS.Center Foundation asks for financial help |author= Yesenia Martynova |date=2016-10-06 |publisher= New Izvestia | language = Russian |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Krasovsky revealed that he has been HIV positive since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iz.ru/679211/2017-12-05/zhurnalist-anton-krasovskii-rasskazal-o-svoem-polozhitelnom-vich-statuse|title=Журналист Антон Красовский рассказал о своем положительном ВИЧ-статусе|language=ru|work=[[Izvestia]]|date=2017-12-05|accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bonnie Woods''' is an [[United States|American]] former [[Scientology|Scientologist]] and critic of the [[Church of Scientology]]. Woods resides in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. She was a member of the [[Sea Org]] within Scientology, and left in 1982. She and her family were monitored by a private investigator. The Church of Scientology spread pamphlets around her [[East Grinstead]] neighbourhood making negative claims about her. Woods sued for [[libel]] against the organization &amp;ndash; in response Scientology filed three libel suits against her. Her case eventually reached the [[High Court of Justice]]. Scientology paid her for costs and damages, and admitted that the claims it had made about her were false.

===Leaving the organization===
An American who moved to Britain, Bonnie Woods had been a member of the [[Sea Organization]] but left Scientology in 1982.&lt;ref name="indep_hate" /&gt; Since 1992, she and her husband Richard have run a telephone helpline for families affected by Scientology.&lt;ref name="american" /&gt; Scientologists declared her a "[[Suppressive Person]]", picketing her house and around [[East Grinstead]] and putting her family under surveillance.&lt;ref name="american" /&gt; She and her family were followed by a private investigator,&lt;ref name="escaperoute" /&gt; and a creditor of theirs was located and provided free legal assistance to sue them.&lt;ref name="hounded" /&gt; Woods told a local paper, "The biggest concern I have is for my children. Obviously I worry about their safety. I can never let them answer the phone or the door."&lt;ref name="escaperoute"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[East Grinstead Courier]] |publisher= |title=Escape route from Scientology has never been busier |date=April 15, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private investigator Eugene Ingram persuaded a creditor of Richard Woods' failed building firm to accept free help from Scientologists to pursue her money.&lt;ref name="hounded" /&gt; As a result, the family was bankrupted.&lt;ref name="american"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology's Campaign Of Hate, By "Cult Busters"|work=[[The American (magazine)|The American]]|date=6 March 1998|last=Nicolova|first=Rossitsa|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hounded"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hounded by the church of stars and hype|work=[[Sunday Times]]|publisher=[[Times Newspapers]]|date=January 1, 1997|last=Driscoll|first=Margarette|author2=Steven Haynes| page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="argus_inside"&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Edwards|title=Inside The Scientologists|work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]] |location=Brighton |date=May 12, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian St. Clair''' (born May 24, 1968) is an [[United States|American]] drummer, best known for being with rock duo [[Local H]], from July 1999 until October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p141542/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Local H|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo |publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised in [[Fullerton, California]], Brian's family moved to the town of [[Glen Ellyn, Illinois]] in 1980.

He has played drums for a few Chicago area bands (in order): Eye's On Troy, Political Justice?, Denied Remarks (as a second drummer), God's Acre, [[My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult]], Rights Of The Accused (also known as: ROTA, the entire band sang back up vocals on a [[1000 Homo Djs]] record), and [[Triple Fast Action]]. Brian moved to NYC in 1998 after [[Triple Fast Action]] broke up.

After Political Justice? broke up St. Clair played with a few bands before landing the roll of drummer in one of Chicago's most famous punk bands Rights Of The Accused. In 1988 ROTA were taken on tour with [[Ministry (band)]] and became close friends with [[Al Jourgensen]] who took them into the studio to sing back up vocals on the [[1000 Homo DJs]] record and put the band in his video for the song Stigmata from the album ''[[The Land of Rape and Honey]]'' where St. Clair played drums, Herb played bass, Wes played guitar, and Mike jumped around and yelled.  However it is very hard to see anyone other than Mike due to all of the fog produced by the fog machine on the set.  Also while in ROTA Brian was cast by [[Cynthia Plaster Caster]], one of the Plaster Casters Of Chicago.

Kidd and St. Clair formed [[Triple Fast Action]] who released several singles on indie labels and a full CD on [[Capitol Records]] and one on [[Deep Elm]] records before Brian left the band to pursue other interests. In 1999 St. Clair joined [[Local H]] with [[Scott Lucas (musician)|Scott Lucas]].

Just prior to [[Local H]] he was the drum tech for [[Bun E. Carlos]] of [[Cheap Trick]], and was credited on Cheap Trick's Silver DVD. Brian has been the [[tour manager]] for [[Liz Phair]], [[Brazilian Girls]], [[Micki Free]], [[Triple Fast Action]], and [[Local H]]. He has also been dubbed one of the "hardest working drummers" in rock history.

{{Other people}}
'''Catherine Blake''' (née '''Boucher'''; 25 April 1762 – 18 October 1831) was the wife of the poet, painter and [[Engraving|engraver]] [[William Blake]], and a vital presence and assistant throughout his life.

==Life==
Catherine was born the daughter of a man of a market gardener{{clarification needed|date=February 2017}} in [[Battersea]], then just outside London on the other side of the [[River Thames]]. She met William here in 1781, during his brief visit to the area, while he was recovering from an emotional upset following the failure of an earlier relationship. Their courtship was brief. According to early biographers of Blake, Catherine immediately recognised him as her future husband and when she sympathised with him over his earlier emotional troubles he replied "do you pity me? Then I love you."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wright, ''Life of William Blake'', Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Blake married Catherine &amp;ndash; who was five years his junior &amp;ndash; on 18 August 1782 in [[St. Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an 'X'.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/William_Blake/11.R.htm Catherine Blake, ca.1805]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 5 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They remained together until his death in 1827.&lt;ref name="M155"&gt;Myrone, 155&lt;/ref&gt; Blake taught her to read and write, and also to use his [[printing-press]].

The couple did not have children, and it has been suggested that Blake wanted to bring a concubine into the relationship to act as a surrogate mother, which was consistent with the theories of [[Swedenborgianism]] by which Blake was influenced.&lt;ref name = "rob"&gt;Robert Rix, ''William Blake and the Cultures of Radical Christianity'', Ashgate, 2007, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Blake's earliest biographer [[Alexander Gilchrist]] does not mention this, but speaks of unspecified troubles in the early years of the relationship. However, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] later explicitly asserted that this was the case, but that Blake dropped the idea when he saw that it upset Catherine. No documentary evidence survives supporting this notion, but Blake is known to have stated that he "learned from the Bible that wives should be held in common."&lt;ref name = "rob"/&gt;
[[File:The Letters of William Blake (1906) Kate's portrait.png|thumb|200px|Pencil drawing by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] after Tatham's life sketch of Catherine Blake]]&lt;!-- another poor reproduction at File:The Letters of William Blake- Catherine Blake.png --&gt;
Writers who knew the couple in their later years describe a very happy relationship. In 1802, [[William Hayley]] wrote that William "and his excellent wife (a true helpmate!) pass the plates thro' a rolling press in their own cottage together".&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt; On his deathbed, Blake drew a picture of Catherine as his last work, stating "you have ever been an angel to me".

After her husband's death Catherine was taken in by Blake's admirer [[Frederick Tatham]], for whom she nominally worked as a housekeeper. At this period she continued to sell Blake's works. When she died four years later Tatham claimed that she had bequeathed all Blake's works to him. When he later converted to [[Irvingite]] beliefs, he destroyed a number of them, asserting that they were inspired by the devil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ackroyd]], ''William Blake'', pp. 368–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Blake's art==
Throughout her husband's uneven career, Catherine not only took an active role in the production of William's engravings and illuminated books; she also ran the household finances and offered strong practical support. William's friend [[John Thomas Smith (1766–1833)|J. T. Smith]] said that Blake "allowed her, to the last moment of his practice, to take off his proof impressions and print his works, which she did most carefully."&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt; Catherine's role in colouring at least some of William's illuminated books has been wide, although her hand is usually attributed to some of the more clumsily rendered passages. Her work as a printer is held in higher regard.&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt;

==Role in literature==
It has often been suggested that the figure of [[Enitharmon]] in Blake's mythology is partly inspired by Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila A. Spector, ''Glorious Incomprehensible: The Development of Blake's Kabbalistic Language'', Bucknell University Press, 2001, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Enitharmon is the wife of the "eternal prophet" [[Los (Blake)|Los]] in Blake's writings. Catherine is explicitly identified as the poet's "shadow of delight" in the second part of Blake's ''[[Milton a Poem]]''.

Catherine appears as a model wife in William Hayley's writings on ideal marriages. In more recent literature, she is the central character in [[Janet Adele Warner]]'s novel ''Other Sorrows, Other Joys: The Marriage of Catherine Sophia Boucher and William Blake'' (2001) and also features in [[Tracy Chevalier]]'s novel ''Burning Bright'' (2007). She is an amateur detective in short stories by [[Keith Heller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hycyber.com/MYST/EQ_ha.html|title=hycyber.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Shepherd (actor)|Jack Shepherd]]'s stage play ''In Lambeth'' dramatised a visit by [[Thomas Paine]] to the [[Lambeth]] home of William and Catherine Blake in 1789. It was first performed at the East Dulwich Tavern in July 1989. The play was later adapted for television in the [[BBC Two]] ''Encounters'' series (which featured similar fictionalised meetings between historical figures) and was first broadcast on 4 July 1993. It was directed by Sebastian Graham-Jones, and featured [[Mark Rylance]] as William, [[Bob Peck]] as Paine and Lesley Clare O'Neill as Catherine.

'''Emanoil Băleanu''' ([[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: Eманoiл БълeaнȢ; {{lang-fr|Emmanuel Balliano}}&lt;ref name="jdd121958"&gt;"Télégraphie privée", in ''[[Journal des Débats]]'', December 19, 1858, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Manuel de Balliano'';&lt;ref name="histem41"&gt;"Histoire de la semaine", in ''L'Illustration de Bade'', Vol. 2, Issue 6, June 1859, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Manole''', '''Manoil''', '''Manuil''' or '''Manolache Băleanu'''; 1793 or 1794–1862), was a [[Wallachia]]n statesman, soldier and industrialist who served as ''[[Caimacam]]'' (regent) in October 1858–January 1859. Descending from an old family of [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyars]], he was one of two sons born to ''[[Ban (title)|Ban]]'' Grigore III Băleanu; the other, Nicolae, was a career bureaucrat, and the State Secretary of Wallachia in 1855–1856. Although prone to displays of [[Romanian nationalism]], the family was prominent under the cosmopolitan [[Phanariotes]], and young Băleanu was educated in Greek. [[List of Wallachian rulers|Prince]] [[Alexandros Soutzos]] welcomed him at the court and became his father-in-law. At that stage, Băleanu's participation in the spoils system was signaled by his highly controversial claim to ownership of [[Târgoviște]] city, and also by his monopoly on handkerchief manufacture. His father hoped to steer the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|anti-Phanariote revolt of 1821]], but both he and Emanoil were driven into exile when [[Bucharest]] fell to the rebels.

In exile, Băleanu Jr began gravitating toward [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberalism]], before becoming curious about [[utopian socialism]]. Under the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime, he was made ''[[Polkovnik]]'' in the [[Wallachian military forces]] and served two terms in the [[Sfatul boieresc|Ordinary National Assembly]]. He and [[Ioan Câmpineanu]] emerged as leaders of the "[[National Party (Romania)|National Party]]", which mounted the opposition to [[Alexandru II Ghica]] and uncovered constitutional irregularities. Băleanu was sent into internal exile in 1841, but reinstated following interventions by his friends in the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja|Wallachian Church]]. He ran in the [[Wallachian princely election, 1842|princely election of 1842]], but conceded defeat in favor of his friend [[Gheorghe Bibescu]], who then made him his ''[[Postelnic]]'' (1843–1847). As such, Băleanu contributed directly to the modernization of Wallachia, and also to the early stages of [[abolitionism]]—though he himself remained a [[Slavery in Romania|slave owner]] to 1855.

Băleanu joined the conservative camp during the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]]. For a few days in June–July of that year, he proclaimed himself ''Caimacam'', heading a reactionary administration alongside Metropolitan [[Neofit II]]. Before being deposed and driven out of Wallachia, he gave the order to destroy revolutionary symbols, including the "Statue of Liberty". Returning with the [[Ottoman Army]], he was again promoted under Prince [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]], and especially during the late stages of the [[Crimean War]], which removed Russian tutelage. His focus fell on obtaining a close alliance between Wallachia and the [[Austrian Empire]].

Băleanu's second, internationally recognized, term as ''Caimacam'' was within a triumvirate that also included [[Ioan Al. Filipescu|Ioan Filipescu-Vulpache]] and [[Ioan Manu]]; alongside the latter, Băleanu instituted a repressive regime, directing censorship and intimidation against the National Party. They organized the [[Wallachian Elective Assembly, 1859|legislative elections of 1859]], but were outmaneuvered by liberals and nationalists, who managed to push through their agenda. Băleanu was brutalized and shunned during events leading up to the establishment of the [[United Principalities]], which put an end to his political career. His only literary work was a manuscript chronicle, which was later exposed as plagiarized.

==Biography==
===Early life===
The Băleanus, whose history is linked to an [[Băleni, Dâmbovița|an eponymous estate]] in [[Dâmbovița County]], belonged to Wallachia's older lineage of [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar nobility]], and claimed kinship with the ancient [[House of Basarab]].&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 352; Lecca, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The family patriarch was [[Udrea Băleanu]], who served as ''[[Ban (title)|Ban]]'' of [[Oltenia]] in the 1590s.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 II), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; His nephew, Ivașco I Băleanu, emerged as a powerful player in 1630s Wallachia, having backed [[Matei Basarab]] for Wallachia's throne; his son, [[Gheorghe Băleanu]], similarly endorsed and fought alongside [[Constantin Șerban]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 114–116&lt;/ref&gt; He was prominent into the 1670s, when he and his family feuded with the [[Cantacuzino family|Cantacuzinos]]; their conflict came to an end in 1679, when Gheorghe's son, [[Ivașco Băleanu|Ivașco II]], was sent into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 116–118, 135–139, 165, 173, 195–196, 215–216&lt;/ref&gt;

Emanoil was Ivașco II's great-great-grandson.&lt;ref&gt;Lecca, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in 1793 or 1794 as the son of ''Ban'' Grigore III Băleanu (1770–1842) and his wife Maria, née Brâncoveanu (?–1837).&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 498; Ion &amp; Berindei, p. 215; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 231; Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, p. 315. See also Bogdan-Duică, p. 252; Lecca, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; On his mother's side, he was a collateral descendant of Wallachian Prince [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]]; Maria's brother, also named [[Grigore Brâncoveanu|Grigore]], was the last male of the [[Craiovești|Craiovești-Brâncoveanu family]].&lt;ref&gt;Ion &amp; Berindei, pp. 214–215&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandmother was a member of a [[Moldavia]]n clan, the [[Sturdza family|Sturdzas]].&lt;ref&gt;Ion &amp; Berindei, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Emanoil's siblings included a sister, Zoe (1791–1877), who married entrepreneur Ștefan Hagi-Moscu.&lt;ref&gt;Ion &amp; Berindei, pp. 215–216. See also Lecca, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brother, Nicolae, as well as two other sisters: Elena, married to [[Constantin Năsturel-Herescu]]; and Luxița, whose husband was writer Nicolae Văcărescu.&lt;ref&gt;Lecca, pp. 9, 85. See also Tiron, pp. 462, 468, 475, 491&lt;/ref&gt;

Emanoil's childhood and youth coincided with the closing stages of the [[Phanariote]] era, during which Wallachia and Moldavia (the "[[Danubian Principalities]]") were more closely integrated with the [[Ottoman Empire]], and Greek immigration became more significant. Father Grigore was involved with the Phanariote administration of [[Bucharest]] and owned houses just west of [[Turnul Colței]].&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, pp. 95, 156; Potra (1990 I), pp. 221, 257, 311, 443; (1990 II), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; He was first propelled to the high office of ''[[Spatharios]]'' and ''[[Logothete]]'' during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812]], when he supported occupation by the [[Russian Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Radu Rosetti]], "Arhiva senatorilor dela Chișinău și ocupația rusească dela 1806—1812. III. Amănunte asupra Moldovei dela 1808 la 1812", in ''Analele Academiei Române'', Vol. XXXII, 1909–1910, pp. 199–200, 202, 260–261, 266, 270, 284&lt;/ref&gt; receiving the [[Order of Saint Anna]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; A patron of literature, he regularly donated from his collection of books, paid for a translation of [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]]'s essays, and reportedly began writing a Romanian dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, pp. 47, 65, 69&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, he sponsored Pete Efesiul's print shop—Wallachia's first publisher of [[sheet music]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Simionescu, "Din activitatea tipografică a Bucureștilor (1683–1830)", in ''Bucureștii Vechi'', Vols. I–IV, 1935, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Emanoil was home-schooled in the city by the Greek tutor Kirkireu, who introduced him to the Phanariote court.&lt;ref&gt;Ghica &amp; Roman, pp. 254–256&lt;/ref&gt; Although one late record suggests that he was also raised in [[Confederation of the Rhine|Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1928), p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; Greek remained his favorite language of expression even later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Dima ''et al.'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; At some point in his youth (probably before 1818), Emanoil produced a chronicle of documenting the history of [[Roman Dacia]] and the [[Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]]. The manuscript was much later exposed as plagiarized version of a similar work by Theodoros Photeinos, which in turn may have copied a since-lost book by [[Dionisie Fotino]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandru Elian, "Introducere", in Alexandru Elian, Nicolae-Șerban Tanașoca (eds.), ''Izvoarele istoriei României, III: Scriitori bizantini (sec. XI–XIV)'', pp. XVI–XVII, XXVII. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1975.  {{OCLC|769301037}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historian Radu Crutzescu proposes that Emanoil's political rise was in large part owed to his kinship with two families: the [[Văcărescu family|Văcărescus]] and the [[Soutzos family|Soutzos]]; he was uncle of [[Marițica Bibescu|Marițica Văcărescu]], who was to become Prince [[Gheorghe Bibescu]]'s wife, and, through his marriage with Catinca, son-in-law of Wallachia's last Phanariote Prince, [[Alexandros Soutzos]].&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; A Wallachian comedy of ca. 1820 shows ''Ban'' Grigore trafficking in influence to benefit his in-laws.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Papacostea-Danielopolu, "La satire sociale-politique dans la littérature dramatique en langue grecque des Principautés (1774—1830)", in ''Revue Des Études Sud-est Européennes'', Vol. XV, Issue 1, January–March 1977, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Phanariote favoritism was also noted by memoirist [[Ion Ghica]]. He mentions that Emanoil's Greek education is what drew Prince Soutzos' attention. Upon his wedding to Catinca, Băleanu received ownership of [[Târgoviște]], which the Prince had abusively claimed as his own; when news of this deal reached the sparked city, the rioting citizens placed a jinx on Soutzos' house.&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 216; Ghica &amp; Roman, pp. 90, 254–256&lt;/ref&gt; Catinca's dowry also included a monopoly on the manufacture of handkerchiefs, which came with additional tax privileges and the right to employ 30 foreign laborers. This included ownership of the textile mill at [[Mărcuța Church]], which Băleanu immediately leased to a Russian immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;Șerban, p. 51. See also Giurescu, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Catinca died in childbirth one year into her marriage, in what was seen by contemporaries as proof that Băleanu was under the "Târgoviște jinx".&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 216; Ghica &amp; Roman, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his son's matrimonial arrangement, Grigore Băleanu was one of the more independently minded boyars, who was made unassailable by his acceptance into a [[Janissaries|Janissary corps]] and his employment of a personal guard.&lt;ref&gt;Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Proud of his Romanian roots, and "in touch with tradition", he reportedly organized street parades that "made Greeks quiver."&lt;ref&gt;Gherghe, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Soutzos' death in January 1821 sparked a political crisis, making Wallachia into a theater for the [[Greek War of Independence]]. In parallel, there was an [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|anti-Phanariote uprising in Oltenia]], which Grigore may have personally have encouraged: he is alleged to have staged Soutzos' poisoning alongside members of the [[Filiki Eteria]], after which he returned as ''Spatharios''.&lt;ref&gt;Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, pp. 88–90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Phanariote period===

Băleanu Sr is additionally cited as one of the boyars who reached out to the rebel leader, [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], and invited him to act on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; His son-in-law Năsturel-Herescu joined the Eteria, and was consequently a soldier in the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 60, 284; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt was soon uncontrollable, and intrinsically anti-boyar in scope. The mill of Mărcuța was looted and rendered inoperable.&lt;ref&gt;Șerban, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; Escaping the threat of a full-blown civil war, the Băleanus took refuge in the [[Austrian Empire]], joining a colony of boyar expatriates in [[Brașov|Corona (Brașov)]].&lt;ref&gt;Dima ''et al.'', p. 246; Iorga (1921), pp. 65, 284, 341–343; Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, pp. 87, 90–91, 315&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Emanoil was inducted into a secretive group of exiles, the "Brașov Society", whose founding members included his father.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, pp. 62–63; Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 184; Dima ''et al.'', p. 246; Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently initiated by the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, following a showdown between Vladimirescu's men and the Eteria, members of the latter called on Grigore to return and seize control of Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 89–89&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1821, the [[Ottoman Army]] invaded and restored the old regime; Nicolae Băleanu, who had "some part to play in the insurrection", fled with the Eterists and made his way to [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt]].&lt;ref name="dlv144–5"&gt;[[Antoine Année]] (ed.), ''Le livre noir de Messieurs Delavau et Franchet, ou Répertoire alphabétique de la police politique sous le ministère déplorable'', Vol. I, pp. 144–145. Paris: Moutardier, 1829.  {{OCLC|65272072}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grigore IV Ghica]] took over as Prince in Bucharest, making Grigore his Minister of Internal Affairs, or ''[[Vornic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolae and his Greek tutor Mavromati spent this interval in the [[Bourbon Restoration|Kingdom of France]], where the former was supposed to further his studies. Both were seen as dangerous suspects by agents of the ''[[Sûreté]]''.&lt;ref name="dlv144–5"/&gt; 

This period was ended by the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|war of 1828]], which again saw both Principalities invaded by the Russian Empire. The Russians and Ottomans reached a compromise on joint rule, and granted a charter, called ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'', which codified fundamental laws in Wallachia and Moldavia. This document was partly co-written by Grigore Băleanu and [[Iordache Filipescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; The throne in Bucharest was assigned to [[Alexandru II Ghica]], who presided over an era of [[Westernization]]. In 1830, formally renouncing [[Ottoman clothing]],&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 I), p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; Emanoil Băleanu was integrated within the restored and modernized [[Wallachian military forces]]. He was one of the last boyars to be granted automatic advancement based on high birth, and almost immediately received the rank of ''[[Polkovnik]]'' (Colonel).&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; He was first assigned command over the 1st Infantry Regiment at [[Craiova]], serving under Russian commanders. His own subordinates included two future conservative polemicists, [[Grigore Lăcusteanu]]&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 55, 57, 59&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dimitrie Papazoglu]].&lt;ref&gt;Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, p. 148; Potra (1990 II), p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; Băleanu was stationed in Bucharest in 1831, when Wallachia was hit by the [[1826–1837 cholera pandemic|second cholera pandemic]]. According to Lăcusteanu, Russian overseer [[Pavel Kiselyov]] held Băleanu and [[Ioan Odobescu]] responsible for the poor hygiene at [[Filantropia Hospital]]. Both were "arrested inside the hospital" and only released following its complete sanitation. According to Lăcusteanu, they relied on take-out food and slept at a local pub.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

While his father was a sponsor of the conservative poet [[Grigore Alexandrescu]],&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 252; Dima ''et al.'', p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Băleanu was sympathetic to [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Wallachian liberalism]], and welcomed in his home [[Teodor Diamant]], who actively campaigned in favor of [[Fourierism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghica &amp; Roman, pp. 292–293&lt;/ref&gt; The Băleanus were otherwise still committed to the preservation of traditional institutions, including [[Slavery in Romania|slavery]]. In January 1837, Grigore sold off a family of [[Romani people in Romania|Romanies]] to a Stavrache Iacov.&lt;ref&gt;Achim ''et al.'', pp. XXII, LII, 63&lt;/ref&gt; 

Băleanu Jr first rose to high civilian office in 1831, taking over as Wallachia's Great ''[[Hetman|Hatman]]''; simultaneously, in the [[Wallachian legislative election, 1831|election of 1831]] he acquired a seat in the [[Sfatul boieresc|Ordinary National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Băleanu, [[Ioan Câmpineanu]], [[Grigore Cantacuzino]] and Iancu Ruset presided over a liberal faction sometimes labeled as "[[National Party (Romania)|National Party]]", and by 1834 produced designs on how to rewrite ''Regulamentul'' into a set of reformist policies.&lt;ref&gt;Ghica &amp; Roman, pp. 422–423. See also Bogdan-Duică, pp. 130–133; Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 499; Popescu, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Băleanu had also helped set up a Philharmonic Society, which promoted culture along with liberal ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Gherghe, p. 14; Ghica &amp; Roman, p. 436; Potra (1990 I), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832,&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Băleanu married Alina Bagration, daughter of a Russian officer and [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagratid]] descendant. She had a public affair with Kiselyov, and went with him to Russia in 1834. Băleanu consented to a divorce in 1836, after which Alina moved in with Kiselyov and his wife Zofia Potocka.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florentin Popescu, [http://archive.li/tc4FS "'Nebun n-am fost, dar am căzut pradă...'"], in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', April 2001. See also Chirică, p. 352; [[Andrei Pippidi]], "Casa Prințesei", in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Issue 194, October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He held on to his Assembly seat following the [[Wallachian legislative election, 1836|1836 election]], which saw his father taking over as chief minister.&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ion Ghica, the Nationals' "four-man party" controlled a majority of the Assembly seats, earning backing from [[Ilarion Gheorghiadis]] and other hierarchs of the [[Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja|Wallachian Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghica &amp; Roman, pp. 422–425&lt;/ref&gt; As members of the Assembly, both Emanoil and Grigore supported the state religion and opposed attempts by the regime to infringe upon its liberties and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; From June of that year, Băleanu Jr, Câmpineanu, Ruset and Alecu "Căciulă-Mare" Ghica joined the ''Regulamentul'' revision committee.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 132; Popescu, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; While researching the matter, they discovered that Russian officials had forged ''Regulamentul'', tying to the original text an "additional article", which indicated that the legislation could not be modified by the Wallachians alone. Although the article remained in place and was recognized as valid by the Ottomans, the scandal was helped to consolidate [[Romanian nationalism]] and [[anti-Russian sentiment]] throughout Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, pp. 120–122; Preda, p. 218.

By 1838, Băleanu, Câmpineanu, Ruset and Costache Faca were members of the Assembly's financial board, questioning government's spending practices and attempting to draw more funds into education.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, Prince Ghica appointed Băleanu as his Minister of Justice, or Great ''Logothete'', although he subsequently reassigned him to Internal Affairs, as ''Vornic''.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the anti-Ghica faction, which by then included brothers Bibescu and [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]] among its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă-Ghițulescu, p. 88. See also Andronescu ''et al.'', pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at the closure of the Assembly in December, the monarch made disgruntled allusions to Băleanu and Câmpineanu, claiming that both had lied in petitions they sent to foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă-Ghițulescu, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1840, he appointed Băleanu as one of the ''efori'' (caretakers) of Wallachia's schools, alongside [[Apostol Arsache]], [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]], and Alecu Ghica.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 1841, after noting his "disrespectful statements" in the Assembly, Ghica ordered Băleanu into internal exile. Sources give his place of banishment as [[Șirna|Varnița]]&lt;ref&gt;Andronescu ''et al.'', pp. 83–84; Vintilă-Ghițulescu, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Bolintin-Vale|Bolintin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghica &amp; Roman, pp. 293, 438&lt;/ref&gt; By then, his Fourierist friends were also targets of repression: Diamant's [[Scăieni Phalanstery]] had been forcefully closed, and his attempts to contact Băleanu were thwarted.&lt;ref&gt;Ghica &amp; Roman, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; However, this clampdown proved to be a miscalculation of Băleanu's support by Russian diplomats and Church officials alike: Metropolitan [[Neofit II]] and consul [[Iakov Dashkov]] pressured him to withdraw the order, which Prince Ghica did on February 3.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă-Ghițulescu, pp. 85–86, 194&lt;/ref&gt; Băleanu remained the central figure of the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă-Ghițulescu, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1841 he oversaw a ceremony for Kiselyov's retirement. Kiselyov was granted Wallachian citizenship on the occasion, prompting speculation that Băleanu was grooming him for the princely throne.&lt;ref&gt;Andronescu ''et al.'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Chambre des États de Valachie.png|thumb|330px|An Ordinary Assembly debate of the 1840s]]
During its final months, the Ghica regime still relied on support from the elder Băleanu, who served as ''Vornic'' in June 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Cătălina Opaschi, "Un jurnal de călătorie inedit al colonelului Vladimir Moret de Blaremberg", in ''Muzeul Național'', Vol. XVII, 2005, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Following Ghica's ouster, Băleanu Jr presented himself for the [[Wallachian princely election, 1842|princely election]], also serving as an elector; his father was also listed as "fit to be Prince", but died of [[coronary artery disease]] before the electors convened.&lt;ref&gt;Andronescu ''et al.'', pp. 92–94, 98. See also Bogdan-Duică, pp. 33, 252&lt;/ref&gt; Băleanu Jr took most votes (79) in the third section.&lt;ref&gt;Andronescu ''et al.'', p. 94; Preda, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; However, he redirected these toward his "intimate friend" Bibescu,&lt;ref&gt;Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; who emerged as the winner. On June 29, 1843,&lt;ref&gt;Andronescu ''et al.'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Băleanu entered the princely cabinet as State Secretary, or ''[[Postelnic]]''. His office unified the attributes of a [[Civil registration|civil registrar]], censor, and Foreign Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo von Gaudi, "București. Un scurt vademecum pentru germani (II)", in ''Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Vol. III, Issue 7, 2000, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, Băleanu countersigned orders to expand and modernize the port of [[Brăila]] (August 1843) and protect insolvent farmers (June 1845), as well as publishing a ''[[firman]]'' confirming free trade between Wallachia and the Ottoman Empire (October 1843).&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 116–121, 171&lt;/ref&gt; His brother had by then established himself as one of Wallachia's leading textile manufacturers, using Austrian know-how to set up a modern factory in [[Tunari]].&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844 the ''Postelnic'' dealt with the issue of French counterfeiters in Wallachia, which, despite protests from consul Adolphe Billecocq, were slated for extradition and execution in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 II), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; From January 1845, he was involved in the beautification of Bucharest, and sketched a project for building new roads between all Wallachian towns.&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 162–169, 567. See also Potra (1990 I), p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, the Assembly appointed him, together with [[Alexandru Vilara]] and [[Alecu Filipescu-Vulpea]], to oversee the charity known as ''Așezămintele Brâncovenești''. This had been set up for Bibescu's estranged wife [[Zoe Brâncoveanu]], whom the prince had declared insane,&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 96, 98&lt;/ref&gt; and who was Băleanu's cousin.&lt;ref&gt;Ion &amp; Berindei, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 19, 1845, Băleanu married his third and last wife—Elena (or Sultana), daughter of [[Constantin Bălăceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Andronescu ''et al.'', p. 106. See also Chirică, p. 352; Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 499; Lecca, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the following year, Bibescu took him to [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruschuk]], where they paid homage to their sovereign, [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Abdulmejid I]].&lt;ref&gt;Andronescu ''et al.'', p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; For a few days in September 1846, while Bibescu and Vilara inspected Oltenia, Băleanu was effectively the leader of the country, and ''[[ad interim]]'' Minister of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, p. 581&lt;/ref&gt; On February 11, 1847, Bibescu and Băleanu urged the Assembly to debate on the issue of slavery. The result of this deliberation was a partial [[Abolitionism|abolition]], namely the release of all Romanies held captive by the Wallachian Church.&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 296–297, See also Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;

Băleanu helped Bibescu to dissolve the Assembly on March 11, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 269–270&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen days later, he was involved in disaster relief following a devastating fire in Bucharest, overseeing the reallocation of funds.&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 273–277; Potra (1990 I), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; His own family home had been destroyed by flames.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 I), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, he signed his name to the [[customs union]] between Wallachia and Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 241–242. See also Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the government reshuffle of May he lost the position of Secretary, which went to Constantin Filipescu; on May 11, he became an honorary ''Vornic'', alongside Vilara.&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 588–589&lt;/ref&gt; From August, he was again ''efor'' on the national school board.&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt; Băleanu was again Minister of Justice in December 1847, when he ordered a clampdown on frivolous litigators and the clarification of [[Fine (penalty)|mulcts]].&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 593–594&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1848, he and [[Ioan Al. Filipescu|Ioan Filipescu-Vulpache]] sat on a committee tasked with constructing a [[National Theatre Bucharest|National Theater]], but the entire project was shelved before taking off.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990 I), pp. 531–532&lt;/ref&gt;

===1848 Revolution===
[[File:Constantin Daniel Rosenthal - Statuia Libertatii.jpg|thumb|220px|Reconstruction of the "Statue of Liberty" in an 1849 [[zincograph]]]]
Initially, Băleanu and Bibescu were open toward the nationalist and liberal groups: by 1845, both had subscribed to [[Nicolae Bălcescu]]'s literary review, ''Magasin Istoric pentru Dacia''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petre P. Panaitescu]], ''Contribuții la o biografie a lui N. Bălcescu'', p. 47. Bucharest: [[Convorbiri Literare]], 1924.  {{OCLC|876305572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within three years, the two camps had come to oppose each other openly. Early June 1848 witnessed the eruption of a [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Wallachia's liberal Revolution]], which first limited Bibescu's authoritarian rule, then deposed him. After the abdication, the boyars assembled and elected Băleanu as ''[[Caimacam]]'', or co-regent, alongside Neofit and ''Ban'' Teodor Văcărescu-Furtună; they were deposed after attempting to reverse the revolutionary trend.&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later that month, generalized panic was created by rumors of a Russian incursion in Wallachia, and the revolutionary administration regrouped around [[Rucăr]]. On June 29, Neofit seized the opportunity and established another conservative government. Băleanu became ''Caimacam'', alongside Filipescu-Vulpache and Văcărescu-Furtună.&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 379–380; Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, pp. 191, 499. See also Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, p. 315; Totu, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lăcusteanu, in public perception Băleanu held the "reins of government"; his army colleague Odobescu was the Minister of War.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 169. See also Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; During his short interval in power, he dismantled and destroyed revolutionary symbols. These famously included a Statue of Liberty, possibly by [[Constantin Daniel Rosenthal]],&lt;ref name="pungă94"&gt;Doina Pungă, "Repere istorice în memoria artei românești — Revoluția de la 1848", in ''Muzeul Național'', Vol. XX, 2008, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; but also a composition depicting "free Romania".&lt;ref&gt;Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 3, the Bucharest bourgeoisie stormed into the army barracks and disarmed Odobescu's men, forcing the government to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 171–175; Totu, pp. 54–55. See also Giurescu, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Neofit, captured by the crowds, declared that the coup had been instigated by Băleanu and [[Iordache Zossima]]. This prompted the revolutionaries to vandalize Băleanu's home and lynch as many of his partisans as they could find.&lt;ref&gt;Elena Condrea, Pârvan Dobrin, "Episoade ale Revoluției de la 1848 din București, în colecția de documente a Direcției Județene Dâmbovița a Arhivelor Naționale", in ''Curier. Revistă de Cultură și Bibliologie'', Vol. IX, Issue 2, 2002, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The revolutionary gazette ''[[Pruncul Român]]'' depicted Băleanu himself as a vandal, calling attention to his earlier artistic purge.&lt;ref name="pungă94"/&gt; The incident was also noted by the far-left radical Bălcescu, who insisted that government make its resolutions into permanent laws. According to Bălcescu, Băleanu was to be prevented from ever returning to Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Berindei]], "Contradicțiile de clasă în desfășurarea revoluției muntene din 1848", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. XI, Issue 3, 1958, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; 

By then the deposed ''Caimacam'' he had again fled to Corona, joining a conservative faction in exile. It also included [[Scarlat Ghica (1812–1857)|Scarlat Ghica]], [[Ioan Slătineanu]], and [[Nicolae Suțu]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1848, the Ottomans invaded and occupied Wallachia, which was again placed under a conservative regime. With [[Constantin Cantacuzino (died 1877)|Constantin Cantacuzino]] as Wallachia's new ''Caimacam'', Băleanu, Filipescu-Vulpea and [[Petrache Poenaru]] returned as ''efori'', and staged a clampdown on revolutionary teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), pp. 166–168&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Nicolae was appointed a ''Logothete'', and served in the post-revolutionary administration of Bucharest. In October, he networked between the city [[guild]]s to ensure that the city and the Ottoman Army were properly supplied with bread.&lt;ref&gt;Margareta Savin, "Contribuții documentare cu privire la cunoașterea cheltuielilor pentru trupele de ocupație a Bucureștilor în anii 1848—1851", in ''Muzeul Național'', Vol. II, 1975, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;

Știrbei was afterwards crowned Prince, more fully restoring the ''Regulamentul'' regime. On August 24, 1850, he made Emanoil his Minister of the Interior, within a cabinet of "relatives and intimate friends".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 51. See also Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; He also returned as chairman of the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, for several years after the Revolution's defeat, Băleanu  failed to impose himself in political life: the newspaper ''[[Vestitorul Românesc]]'' dismissed him as "entirely unremarkable".&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; He had by then returned to his activities as an industrialist, with a new textile factory, which employed as many as 200 workers, opened in [[Dragomirești-Vale|Dragomirești]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Botezan, "Problema agrară în dezbaterile parlamentare din Romînia în anul 1862", in ''Studia Universitatis Babeș-Bolyai. Historia'', Vol. IV, Issue 1, 1961, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; He stood out among conservatives for opposing all attempt at implementing [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], and also for resisting the projected reductions of boyar privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; Băleanu also remained a slave-owner and, in May 1850, had a runaway Romani family returned to him by the authorities in [[Dolj County]].&lt;ref&gt;Achim ''et al.'', pp. XXXI, LXII, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Regulamentul'' period ended during the [[Crimean War]], which was a clash between the Principalities' Russian and Ottoman protectors. Știrbei left Wallachia, without abdicating, in October 1853 and his cabinet continued to function.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 156–159&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1854, ''Spatharios'' Năsturel-Herescu sought to integrate the Wallachian army into [[Halim Pasha]]'s Ottoman troops; on August 23, [[Omar Pasha]] instituted [[martial law]], and on August 31 set up a new government, headed by Năsturel and Cantacuzino.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 161–164&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Austria had effectively occupied Wallachia, and the Ottoman presence was symbolic. In that context, Nicolae Băleanu was involved in state-sponsored abolitionism, serving on a financial committee that also included [[Ioan Manu]], and later as Chairman of the Wallachian Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Achim ''et al.'', pp. 192–193, 196–197, 203–212&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triumvirate and downfall===
Știrbei returned as an Austrian protegé on September 23, creating himself a new cabinet, with Nicolae Băleanu serving as State Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 166–167, 187&lt;/ref&gt; Emanoil also returned as Interior Minister. On December 14, 1855, both brothers, alongside Câmpineanu, Filipescu-Vulpache, [[Alexandru Plagino]] and [[George Barbu Știrbei]], signed the decree which emancipated all of Wallachia's 200,000 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gheorghe Sion]], ''Suvenire contimporane'', p. 53. Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1915.  {{OCLC|7270251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emanoil then oversaw the effort to count and register the newly freed Romanies.&lt;ref&gt;Achim ''et al.'', pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Austrian occupation was giving way to a shared custody of Wallachia and Moldavia by a consortium of European powers, backing Ottoman suzerainty. Prince Știrbei finally resigned on June 25, 1856: from [[Pitești]], he declared Secretary Nicolae Băleanu as the highest authority in Wallachia. On July 4, he resigned in favor of his brother's enemy, [[Alexandru II Ghica]], who took the title of ''Caimacam''.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ghica turned increasingly liberal, and was regarded by his Austrian supervisors as "almost child-like";&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1928), p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; the Băleanus, meanwhile, endured as conservative leaders. That year, poet [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]] characterized Emanoil as a figure out of [[Molière]]'s comedies and an ultra-reactionary: "he wishes to preserve all titles, honors, privileges, [and] has protection from Russia and Austria".&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; While similarly noting Băleanu's Austrian sympathies, [[Franz Graf von Wimpffen|Franz von Wimpffen]] cautioned that he was also lazy, unintelligent, and corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1928), p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; With this platform and backing, Băleanu ran in the [[Wallachian legislative election, 1857|September 1857 election]] and took a seat in the Assembly, which had been reconstructed and enlarged as an "[[ad hoc Divan]]".&lt;ref&gt;Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; 

On October 21, 1858,&lt;ref&gt;Bibescu, pp. 518–519&lt;/ref&gt; Emanoil Băleanu, Manu and Filipescu-Vulpache were formally appointed as ''Caimacami''. The ''firman'' confirming this arrangement specified that Băleanu oversaw Internal Affairs, while Vulpache was ''Logothete'' and Manu chaired the Divan.&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Băleanu's return was especially controversial: he was now regarded as a leading adversary of the National Party, which sought to obtain a union between Wallachia and Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, pp. 353–354&lt;/ref&gt; He and Manu clashed with the more liberal Vulpache as early as October 29, when they promoted their political friend Slătineanu as Minister of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioan C. Filitti]], "Ioan Slătineanu—Cel d'intâiu ocărmuitor al Brăilei după 1829 (Notiță biografică)", in ''Analele Brăilei. Revistă de Cultură Regională'', Vol. I, Issues 2–3, March–June 1929, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; 

The two conservative ''Caimacami'' were in a position to control the [[Wallachian Elective Assembly, 1859|new elections for the Divan]], and were widely suspected of intending to manipulate results. Threats were posted on their townhouse gates, describing them as the "bandit brothers"&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; and hinting at popular revenge. An [[incendiary device]] was reportedly thrown into Manu's home.&lt;ref name="jdd121958"/&gt; In December, after the breakdown of negotiations between foreign diplomats, the issue of electoral fraud became an international scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, pp. 354–355&lt;/ref&gt; Revelations had also emerged that the ''Caimacami'' had denied eligibility to some of the leading National-Party candidates, including [[Vasile Boerescu]], [[Cezar Bolliac]], and [[C. A. Rosetti]]. Such restrictions relied on different readings of the suffrage qualifications: while Manu and Băleanu argued that candidates needed to own landed estates, Vulpache offered a dissenting opinion, with no restrictions for burghers or industrialists; this created a definitive schism within the regency, and pushed Vulpache closer to the National Party.&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; Though they went back on some of their more controversial decisions, the other two ''Caimacami'' proceeded to govern by increasingly dictatorial means, suspending judicial independence, generalizing censorship, and ordering troops to mobilize in areas of the country that showed vocal support for unionism.&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, pp. 355–356&lt;/ref&gt; The regency also restricted all forms of electoral propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Gherghe, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The elections doubled as a contest for the princely throne, with both Bibescu and Știrbei entering the race. Although Băleanu himself was a client of both former princes, he registered as a candidate, with his new title of ''Ban'', also running against his father-in-law Bălăceanu.&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; On this second attempt, he was credited with minimal chances, being an "unexpected" contender.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The elections produced unintended results for all of the conservative groups: backed by radicalized crowds, the National Party was able to pass resolutions in favor of union, and to invalidate seven deputies. As reported by [[Alexandru G. Golescu]], "that swine Manu" and "that idiot Băleanu" had to leave the Divan's hall and were heckled and threatened as they returned to their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Oțetea]], "Însemnătatea istorică a Unirii", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. XII, Issue 1, 1959, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests that Băleanu begged the crowd for forgiveness, but was merely derided.&lt;ref&gt;N. Adăniloaiei, Matei D. Vlad, "Rolul maselor populare în făurirea Unirii Țărilor Romîne", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. XII, Issue 1, 1959, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eventually, the Divan elected [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] as ''[[Domnitor]]''. Having already carried the [[Moldavian Elective Assembly, 1858|Moldavian election]], Cuza was positioned to create the [[United Principalities]], initially as a [[personal union]]. Băleanu left Wallachia during the union process, and in June 1858 had reached the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].&lt;ref name="histem41"/&gt; He died in 1862, and was buried at [[Bolintin-Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; Ion Ghica was appointed [[executor]], in which capacity he demanded a survey on the estates of [[Corbii Mari|Corbii]] and [[Vânătorii Mici|Vânătorii]]; in 1866–1867, his land dispute with the local peasants led the latter to riot.&lt;ref&gt;V. Mihodrea, "Frămîntări țărănești după aplicarea reformei agrare. Revoltele de la Mizil, Corbii și Vînătorii Mari, în 1866 și 1867", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. XI, Issue 1, 1958, pp. 108–112&lt;/ref&gt; Emanoil's widow Elena died in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Crutzescu &amp; Teodorescu, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; He was also survived by his brother Nicolae (to 1868),&lt;ref&gt;Tiron, pp. 464, 468, 475&lt;/ref&gt; by his sons Emanuel, who served in the [[Senate of Romania]], and George; and by daughters Maria and Elena.&lt;ref&gt;Lecca, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; His niece Zoe Hagi-Moscu (1819–1904) was the wife of politician [[Constantin N. Brăiloiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ion &amp; Berindei, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eric Muenter''' (1871–1915), also known as '''Erich Münter''', '''Erich Muenter''', '''Erich Holt''' or '''Frank Holt''', was a [[Germany|German]]-[[United States|American]] activist and would-be [[assassination|assassin]].

Morgan]] in his home, and predicted the bombing of a steamship bound for England before committing suicide under custody of police. His activities along with those of other Germans were played up by the press as "Hun barbarity" anti-German feelings rose in the years as America eventually entered the war with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.newspapers.library.in.gov/tag/german-americans/ ERICH MUENTER, PRO-GERMAN “PEACE CRANK,” DYNAMITES THE U.S. SENATE FEBRUARY 11, 2016 STEPHEN J.

==Biography==

=== Murder of wife ===

While teaching German at [[Harvard University]] in 1906 he poisoned his pregnant wife. Leona Muenter died April 16, 1906 of arsenic poisoning. On April 27, 1906, Cambridge Massachusetts police issued a warrant for the arrest of Erich Muenter. On June 5, 1906 Muenter mailed a pamphlet entitled “Protest” to his wife’s family from New Orleans. He vowed that he would “annihilate” Chicago and Cambridge" in one blow if he could for accusing him of poisoning his wife, and claimed that he actually feared the punishment inflicted on Christian Scientists who refused medical treatment.&lt;ref name="reignterror"&gt;{{cite news|title="Erich Muenter’s "Reign of Terror" |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/muenter.html|accessdate=13 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New York Times Index|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ts49AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA285|year=1915|publisher=New York Times Company|pages=285–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muenter, Once German Teacher Here, Killed Wife, Shot Morgan, Sabotaged in World War 1|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1942/2/14/muenter-once-german-teacher-here-killed/|website=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=February 14, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Says Muenter Is Not Guity|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH19060501.2.92#|accessdate=10 June 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Los Angeles Herald|date=May 1, 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He fled before this was discovered, and spent the next decade in various places in the United States under assumed identities.&lt;ref name=apted_obit&gt;

=== German spy intelligence ===

Muenter went underground in Mexico for a period before emerging again in Texas under a new identity and marrying a new wife. He got jobs in colleges working his way up to Ivy League as German professor Frank Holt at Cornell University. In 1915, Muenter was inspired by the book The War and America by Hugo Münsterberg, another German sympathizer. He became involved with the secret German spy intelligence unit [[Abteilung IIIb]] which was sabotaging arms-carrying vessels departing from U.S. ports with small chemical timer incendiary bombs which would explode at sea after a couple of days. Throughout his attacks on shipping, the Capitol Building and J.P. Morgan, Jr. he maintained he was just an angry peace activist acting on his own. German networks were later alleged to have supported his attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.newspapers.library.in.gov/erich-muenter-pro-german-peace-crank-dynamites-the-u-s-senate/ ERICH MUENTER, PRO-GERMAN “PEACE CRANK,” DYNAMITES THE U.S. SENATE FEBRUARY 11, 2016 STEPHEN J. TAYLOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Muenter clearly had connections to the German network and taunted authorities with veiled statements about Abteilung IIIB’s ship sabotage efforts &lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2015/06/22/terrorism-hits-home-1915-us-capitol-bombing Terrorism Hits Home in 1915: U.S. Capitol Bombing 6/22/2015 in DC by Mark Jones]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1915 United States Capitol bomb attack ===
[[File:Senate Bombing July 2, 1915.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Aftermath of the bombing of the Senate reception room]]

On July 2, 1915, Muenter hid a package containing three sticks of [[dynamite]] with a timing mechanism set for nearly midnight under a telephone switchboard in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] reception room in the [[United States Capitol]], [[Washington, D.C.]] His original target had been the [[United States Senate chamber|Senate chamber]], which he found locked. The bomb exploded at approximately 11:40 PM resulting in no casualties. Muenter wrote a letter to ''[[The Washington Star]]'' under a [[pseudonym]] R. Pearce, explaining his actions, which was published after the bombing. He said that he hoped the explosion would "make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamor for war. This explosion is an exclamation point in my appeal for peace."&lt;ref name="Bomb Rocks Capitol"&gt;{{cite web | title = Bomb Rocks Capitol | publisher = United States Senate | url = https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Bomb_Rocks_Capitol.htm | accessdate = 19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SS ''Minnehaha'' steamship bomb attack ===

After setting off the bomb in the Capitol, he fled to New York City, where he hid a [[pencil bomb]] timed explosive on  [[SS Minnehaha|SS ''Minnehaha'']], a ship loaded with munitions bound for Britain.&lt;ref name="Minnehaha"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kinghorn|first1=Jonathan|title=S.S. Minnehaha|url=http://www.atlantictransportline.us/content/31Minnehaha.htm|website=The Atlantic Transport Line|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shooting of J.P. Morgan Jr. ===

Under the alias of Frank Holt,  Muenter took a train and a cab to the East Island, [[Glen Cove, New York]] estate of J. P. Morgan on July 3, 1915. The millionaire financier Morgan had helped Britain finance its war effort against Germany. He carried a small suitcase with newspaper clippings against arms shipments, and a few sticks of dynamite, while in his coat was carrying two revolver handguns and another stick of dynamite. Muenter rang the front door bell. When the butler opened the door, Muenter presented a business card and demanded to see Mr. Morgan. When the butler balked after he would not state his business, Muenter pulled out both revolvers, and ran into the house looking for Morgan. When he enountered children, he pointed a pistol at them and had them follow. On the staircase he shouted "Now, Mr. Morgan, I have you!" as Mrs Morgan tried to block the path to her husband, but Morgan lunged at his attacker and tackled Muenter to the ground as he fired two rounds into Morgan's groin and thigh. Having pinned Muenter to the ground, Morgan twisted one revolver out of his attacker's hand as his wife and others grabbed the other. Muenter was heard to cry “Kill me! Kill me now! I don’t want to live any more. I have been in a perfect hell
for the last six months on account of the European war.” Morgan's butler finished subduing Muenter, beating him senseless with a lump of coal. Morgan recovered quickly, returning to work on August 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glencoveheritage.com/legacy_site/morganshooting.pdf  The Day Morgan was Shot Glenn Cove Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; {{refn|{{cite news

Muenter refused to identify himself to police, saying only that he was a Christian gentleman who wanted to persuade Morgan to end the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038411/1915-07-03/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1836&amp;index=3&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Cove+Glen+MORGAN+Morgan+SHOT+shot&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1922&amp;proxtext=glen+cove+morgan+shot&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 Harrisburg telegraph., July 03, 1915]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a tip was soon received pointing out a resemblance between "Holt" and Muenter, who was still wanted in Cambridge for the poisoning of his wife.{{refn|name=chronicle|{{cite newspaper

In his jacket he had written down the names of Morgan’s four children, and a clipped cartoon of Lady Liberty pointing to a crate of fireworks, representing the European war, telling Uncle Sam that they are "dangerous fireworks". He also circled some sailings on a schedule for merchant vessels leaving New York. He told police that his original intention was to take Morgan’s wife and children hostage to force Morgan to help stop munitions shipments to Europe, though on at least one occasion he admitted he also intended to assassinate Morgan. Authorities quickly connected him to the Capitol bombings and the wife poisoning case. A search of the suitcase found a handwritten letter addressed to “His Majesty the German Kaiser” similar to letters he mailed out at the time of the bombing of the Capitol signed "R. Pearce". The Morgan shooting made world headlines the next Sunday morning, the 4th of July.

=== Bomb-making materials ===

Captain Thomas J.Tunney, head of New York City Police Department’s Bomb Squad, tricked Muenter into confessing details how he had made the timer for the Capitol bomb, but he would not tell all until July 7. Police tracked down a trunk Muenter had placed in storage in New York City. Inspector of Combustibles Owen Egan declared it "the greatest equipment for bomb making ever brought to New York" with 134 sticks of dynamite, blasting caps, coils of fuse, batteries, nitric acid, windproof matches, mercury fulminate, smokeless explosive powder. Three explosive tin can bombs had been recently completed.

=== Suicide ===

Muenter tried to kill himself on the night of July 5 by slashing his wrist with a pencil eraser metal retainer. On July 6, he was dead. New York’s counterterrorism police at first believed that he was killed by an assassin sent to silence him with two bullets in the head. But the version they decided on was that Muenter ran out of a briefly opened door and jumped head-first onto the concrete floor of the jail corridor twenty feet below.&lt;ref name="dallasreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name=apted_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=morgan/&gt;&lt;ref name="Man"/&gt; Muenter's wife received a note from her husband warning that a ship bound for England would sink on the 7th of July. On that day, just two days after his suicide, the crew was warned but they could not find the bomb on the ''[[SS Minnehaha]]''. It exploded, but had been placed far away from the munitions and caused minor damage.&lt;ref name="Minnehaha"/&gt;

Born an only child in [[Walthamstow]], [[Essex]], Wellum was educated at [[Forest School (Walthamstow)|Forest School]], [[Snaresbrook]] before serving in the [[RAF]].

==Career==

===1921–1942===

[[File:Brian Kingcome IWM HU 112488.jpg|thumb|left|Flight Lieutenant [[Brian Kingcome]] (left), commanding officer of No. 92 Squadron Royal Air Force and his wingman, Flying Officer Geoffrey Wellum, next to a Supermarine Spitfire at RAF Biggin Hill, Kent, 1941]]

Aged eighteen, he signed up on a short-service commission with the [[Royal Air Force]] in August 1939. The first aircraft he flew was the [[Tiger Moth]] at [[RAF Desford|Desford airfield]] in [[Leicestershire]]; after successfully completing the course he then went on to fly the [[North America]]n [[T-6 Texan|Harvard]] at [[RAF Little Rissington]] with 6FTS.

He was then posted directly in May 1940 to [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|92 Squadron]], flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.92squadron.com A Cobra in the Sky. Simon Morris. The History of 92 Squadron RAF]
&lt;/ref&gt; He saw extensive action during the [[Battle of Britain]]. His first commanding officer was [[Roger Bushell]], (later immortalised in ''[[The Great Escape (book)|The Great Escape]]''),&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; and his close colleagues included [[Brian Kingcome]].&lt;ref name=2wwf&gt;{{citation |first=James |last=Holland |authorlink=James Holland (author)|url=http://www.griffonmerlin.com/wwii-interview/geoffrey-wellum/ |title=Interview with Geoffrey Wellum |date=February 2001}}, Curiously, in Wellum's book, Kingcome is spelled all the time as "Kingcombe". Wellum describes Kingcome as "the finest fighter pilot I ever flew with" and recommends his book ''A Willingness to Die''&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed a [[Heinkel He 111]] shot down on 11 September, and a quarter share in a [[Junkers Ju 88]] downed on 27 September 1940. Two (and one shared) [[Messerschmitt]] [[Bf 109]]s were claimed 'damaged' during November 1940. A Bf 109 was claimed shot down on 9 July 1941 over [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;'Those Other Eagles' Shores, 2004, page 635&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1942 he was transferred to [[No. 65 Squadron RAF|65 Squadron]] based at [[RAF Debden|Debden]], being appointed a Flight Commander in March 1942.

On 11 August 1942, Wellum led eight Spitfires launched from the carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} to reinforce the fighter complement at [[Luqa]] airfield on [[Malta]]. Here he joined [[No. 145 Squadron RAF|145 Squadron]] on air defence duties.

===1943–1960===
Wellum suffered severe [[sinusitis]] and [[Combat stress reaction|battle fatigue]] after three years' intensive frontline flying. He returned from Malta to Britain, becoming a test pilot on the [[Hawker Typhoon]], based at [[Gloster Aircraft]].

He finished the war as a gunnery instructor, staying in the RAF, first as a [[staff officer]] in [[Federal Republic of Germany|West Germany]], followed by a four-year tour with [[No. 192 Squadron RAF|192 Squadron]]. He married Grace, his wartime girlfriend, and they had three children.&lt;ref name=indy&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/geoffrey-wellum-prize-fighter-644419.html Geoffrey Wellum: Prize fighter] [[The Independent]] 4-June-2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960 to 1980s===
Wellum left the Royal Air Force in 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-44895703|title=Youngest Battle of Britain RAF pilot dies|date=20 July 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took over the family business.

==Retirement==
In the mid-1980s, with the family business in [[liquidation]] and his [[divorce]] pending,&lt;ref name=Spec6142928/&gt; Wellum retired, as he had promised himself in his youth, to [[The Lizard]] peninsula, [[Cornwall]],&lt;ref name=Spec6142928&gt;{{citation |last=House |first=Christian |title=The 89-year-old Boy |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/6142928/the-89yearold-boy/ |newspaper=The Spectator |date=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; settling in [[Mullion, Cornwall|Mullion]]. To prove to himself that he had actually done something with his life,&lt;ref name=Spec6142928/&gt; he took his wartime notebooks and wrote a [[long hand|longhand]] memoir of his time as a Spitfire pilot, that he never intended for publication. He was a member of the [[Royal Air Force Club]].

==''First Light''==
{{main|First Light (Wellum book)}}
Approached in 2000 by author [[James Holland (author)|James Holland]] who was researching a fictional novel based during the Battle of Britain, Wellum lent him his unpublished memoir. Holland showed it to friends in publishing at [[Penguin Books]] and, in 2002, Eleo Gordon, Penguin’s editorial director, approached Wellum with a publishing deal&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spec6142928/&gt; – two decades after he had originally written the memoir.&lt;ref name=Spec6142928/&gt; ''[[First Light (Wellum book)|First Light: The Story of the Boy Who Became a Man in the War-Torn Skies Above Britain]]'' was published by: Viking Books, 2002 (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-670-91248-4}}); Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003 (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-471-42627-X}}); Penguin Books, 2003 (paperback, {{ISBN|0-14-100814-8}}).

==Television==
Wellum has contributed to various television documentaries on the Battle of Britain, including ''Spitfire Ace'' produced by RDF Media/Channel 4 (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Spitfire Ace |url=http://www.channel4.com/community/showcards/S/Spitfire_Ace.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503113129/http://www.channel4.com/community/showcards/S/Spitfire_Ace.html |archivedate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dangerous Adventures for Boys'' produced by Channel 5 (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tvthrong.co.uk/dangerous-adventures-for-boys/martin-kemp-the-battle-of-britain-1-6 |title=Martin Kemp: The Battle of Britain (1/6) |series= Dangerous Adventures For Boys }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Spitfire: Britain's Flying Past'' produced by the BBC (Sep 2011) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0153yb6 |title=The Spitfire: Britain's Flying Past}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To mark the 70th anniversary of the [[Battle of Britain]], the BBC commissioned a one-off drama for TV called ''First Light'', based on Wellum's book of the same name. The film was first shown by the BBC on 14 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ttjz0 |title=First Light}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==

'''Giuseppa Vitale''' (born in Partinico, 1972), better known as '''Giusy''', is the sister of [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] bosses Leonardo, Michele and [[Vito Vitale]] from [[Partinico]] (Sicily). Giusy took over the command over the clan when her brothers were in prison or fugitives, despite the formal Mafia rule that excludes the participation of women in the criminal organisation.&lt;ref name=bbc260698&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/120852.stm Mafia showdown averted], BBC News, June 26, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; As such she was considered a new breed of 'bosses in skirts'.&lt;ref name=ind030705&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20050703/ai_n14684777/ 'La prima donna boss' Vitale tells court of her Mafia family life], The Independent on Sunday, July 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Later she became a [[pentito|pentita]], a state witness breaking the "[[omertà]]," or code of silence, testifying against her own family.

==Mafia heritage==
She was raised in a traditional Mafia family in Partinico, 40 kilometres from [[Palermo]]. The Vitale clan had taken over the Partinico [[Mandamento (Sicilian Mafia)|mandamento]] from [[Nenè Geraci]] in 1991-92.&lt;ref name=nar1005/&gt; At the age of six she started to visit prison regularly when her brother Leonardo was jailed. "Life for me was with my brothers," she told a court after she became a state witness. "It was impossible to have any relationship with people of my own age. I had absolutely no idea of how to live a different life."&lt;ref name=ind030705/&gt;&lt;ref name=rep180605&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/cronaca/provenzano/fvitale/fvitale.html "Mamma spiegami cos'è la mafia?" Così il boss divenne una pentita], La Repubblica, June 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the age of 13 she left school because her family needed her services to carry messages to and from relatives in prison. Her brother Leonardo, who was 17 years her major and acted as her father, was jealous, she explained. "I'd reached the third year of middle school but he wouldn't let me go any further."&lt;ref name=ind030705/&gt; She knew her brothers were men of honour in Cosa Nostra and they kept her informed.&lt;ref name=nar1005/&gt;

==Capo mandamento==
Her brothers became fugitives and, later, were arrested and both given long jail sentences for murder. Leonardo and Vito turned to Giusy to keep the clan moving and exchange messages while they were separate. While not a "man of honour" in both senses – women are not allowed to enter the Mafia as made members – Giusy Vitale became the regent of the mandamento after the arrest of her brother Vito in April 1998 and managed the affairs of the Vitale clan, although she could not participate in Mafia meetings.&lt;ref name=ind030705/&gt;&lt;ref name=nar1005/&gt; 

Her brothers had several reasons to give her the position: their sister was already fully aware of all the secrets of the family because she had been the go-between for the members inside and outside jail. Moreover, she proved to have a strong character while being already a member of the blood family so that the leadership could stay within the Vitale clan and there would be less risk that someone else would take over their position.&lt;ref name=nar1005/&gt;
 
She showed remarkable resourcefulness and autonomy. The court attributed to Vitale a decisively different role from the one that Mafia women had performed in the past. She took part in the decisions her brothers made in prison, personally contacted leading Mafia personalities, such as Corleone bosses [[Leoluca Bagarella]] and [[Giovanni Brusca]]. Such an essential position had never been seen involving a woman.&lt;ref name=fiandaca286&gt;Fiandaca, ''Women and the Mafia'', p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Other Mafia bosses accepted the nomination by her brothers, and she could be considered a veritable ''donna d'onore''.&lt;ref name=nar1005/&gt;

==Arrest==
Two months after she has assumed the leadership of the mandamento, she was arrested in June 1998.&lt;ref name=bbc260698/&gt; Charged with Mafia association, she was sentenced to six years. In December 2002, she was released, but arrested again in March 2003 for ordering a murder.&lt;ref name=nar1005&gt;{{it icon}} [http://transcrime.cs.unitn.it/tc/fso/IMG%20altre%20iniziative/dossier_narcomafie_principato_6_27.pdf L’altra metà della Cupola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722063915/http://transcrime.cs.unitn.it/tc/fso/IMG%20altre%20iniziative/dossier_narcomafie_principato_6_27.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}, by Teresa Principato, Narcomafie, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first woman charged with Mafia association – confirming the leading position of Vitale in the Cosa Nostra family.&lt;ref name=nar1005/&gt;

==Pentita==
While in jail, Giusy, mother of two, met a pentito, Alfio Garozzo, a former head of the [[Cursotti clan]] from [[Catania]]. Her husband, Angelo Caleca, was serving time for a killing that she allegedly ordered. In February 2005, she became a state witness ([[pentito|pentita]]). She gave testimony about her role as family boss, including how she helped her brother Leonardo to organise "a number of murders" from behind bars.&lt;ref name=cds260305&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2005/03_Marzo/26/donna_pentita.shtml La donna boss si pente: lo faccio per i figli], Corriere della Sera, March 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dt170405&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1488044/Mafia-%27godmother%27-turns-supergrass-on-own-family.html Mafia 'godmother' turns supergrass on own family], The Daily Telegraph, April 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her brother Leonardo, after learning that his sister started to collaborate with Italian justice, said at a trial: "I've learned that a certain blood relation of mine is collaborating with justice. We disown her whether she's living or dead - and we hope it's the latter, and as quickly as possible."&lt;ref name=dt170405/&gt;&lt;ref name=rep080405&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/cronaca/mafia/vitale/vitale.html Mafia, il boss rinnega la sorella: "Sei pentita, che tu possa morire"], La Repubblica, April 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

She justified her decision to testify simply "for the good of my children." She said: "I want to be a mother and I want to be near my bambini. They've got to grow up with me. If I stay in prison, I'll lose them."&lt;ref name=dt170405/&gt; "While I was in jail, they brought my son, who is now 12, to see me. He was about six then and I remember that he asked me why I had been arrested. In particular I remember he said, 'Mamma, what is the Mafia?' I didn't know what to say."&lt;ref name=ind030705/&gt;&lt;ref name=rep180605/&gt; 

She petitioned for divorce, violating yet another of the Cosa Nostra's strict rules, which forbids adultery. Vitale today lives outside Sicily under Italy's witness protection programme, and is making a new life for herself with her children.&lt;ref name=ind030705/&gt;

'''Hugh Gallagher''' (October 17, 1932 – July 13, 2004) was an author and international disability advocate.  Born in [[Palo Alto, California]], he grew up in [[Chicago]], [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]

He contracted [[polio]] in 1952 at age 19 while studying at [[Haverford College]]. He drafted the [[Architectural Barriers Act of 1968]], which required that buildings built with federal funds be made accessible to all; it eventually was enacted into law. In 1956, he graduated from what is now [[Claremont McKenna College]] in California and then went on a Marshall scholarship to [[Oxford University]], where he received the equivalent {{Clarify|date=August 2013}} of a master's degree in political science, philosophy and economics. [[Bob Dole]] wrote, "Hugh's most outstanding contribution to the quality of life of people with disabilities was to successfully place disability on the agenda of the Congress for the first time." {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

'''The Hugh Gallagher Award''' was created by Peter Kovler to commemorate Gallagher, who used his writing to educate the public about injustices, to promote understanding among diverse populations and to draw people into the choice-in-dying movement. The Award is given annually by [[Compassion &amp; Choices]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Gallagher, who wrote from his home in [[Cabin John, Maryland]], died of cancer in [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 13, 2004, aged 71.

'''Irma Ida Ilse Grese''' (7 October 1923 – 13 December 1945) was a female ''[[SS]]'' guard at the [[Nazi concentration camp]]s of [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], and served as warden of the women's section of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]]; ''The Belsen trial''; 18 September 1945; pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Grese was convicted for crimes involving the ill-treatment and murder of prisoners committed at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, and sentenced to death at the [[Belsen trial]]. Executed at 22 years of age, Grese was the youngest woman to die judicially under British law in the 20th century. Auschwitz inmates nicknamed her the "Hyena of Auschwitz" ({{lang-de|die Hyäne von Auschwitz}}).&lt;ref name="Hollander"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRswAQAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22Hy%C3%A4ne+von+Auschwitz%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Hy%C3%A4ne%20von%20Auschwitz%22&amp;f=false|title=Vier Stückchen Brot: Ein Hymne an das Leben|publisher=Verlag|isbn=978-3641127091|date=2013|accessdate=4 January 2015|author=Magda Hollander-Lafon|pages=95{{ndash}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WELT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/literarischewelt/article131751631/Sie-waren-Moerderinnen-aus-Gelegenheit.html|title=Die Hyäne von Auschwitz|publisher=DIE WELT|website=Sie waren Mörderinnen aus Gelegenheit|date=30 August 2014|accessdate=4 January 2015|author=Barbara Möller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/nazi-jaeger-hanns-alexander-auf-der-spur-von-rudolf-hoess-a-986892.html|title=Der Mann, der Rudolf Höß jagte|publisher=Spiegel Online, Hamburg, Germany|website=KZ-Aufseherin Irma Grese.

==Early life and family==
Irma Ilse Ida Grese was born to Berta Grese and Alfred Grese, a dairy worker, on 7 October 1923. Irma was the third of five children (three girls and two boys).&lt;ref name="Nizkor.org"/&gt; In 1936, her mother committed [[suicide]] by drinking [[hydrochloric acid]] after discovering that Alfred had had an affair with a local pub owner's daughter.&lt;ref name="First Belsen Trial Brief History"&gt;[http://www.bergenbelsen.co.uk/pages/Staff/Staff.asp?CampStaffID=53 First Belsen Trial Oberaufseherin Irma Ilse Ida Grese], bergenbelsen.co.uk; accessed 8 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Historian [[Peter Vronsky]] speculated that Alfred Grese joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1937&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Female Serial Killers: How and Why Women Become Monsters|first=Peter|last=Vronsky|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FdN0MMbGIQkC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=irma+grese+when+she+1937#v=onepage&amp;q=irma%20grese%20when%20she%201937&amp;f=false|publisher=Penguin|year=2007|isbn=9781101205693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blogboyerhistory.bloguez.com/blogboyerhistory/836238/Biographie_de_Irma_Grese_Gardienne_SS_a_AUSCHWITZ|title=Biographie de Irma Grese Gardienne SS à Auschwitz|date=18 December 2009|accessdate=1 March 2016|trans-title=Biography of Irma Grese, Guardian SS at Auschwitz|website=BlogBoyerHistory.Bloguez.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302151957/http://blogboyerhistory.bloguez.com/blogboyerhistory/836238/Biographie_de_Irma_Grese_Gardienne_SS_a_AUSCHWITZ|archivedate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remarried in 1939.&lt;ref name="First Belsen Trial Brief History"/&gt;

Irma's sister, Helene Grese, noted at Irma's trial that in primary school, when "girls were quarreling and fighting, [Irma] never had the courage to fight, but… ran away."&lt;ref name=KaterP70&gt;Kater, Michael H. ''Hitler Youth''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2006, pg. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She left school in 1938 at age 15, probably due to a combination of a poor scholastic aptitude,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} bullying by classmates,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and a [[fanaticism|fanatical]] preoccupation with the [[League of German Girls]] (''Bund Deutscher Mädel''), the Nazi female youth organization, of which her father disapproved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Among other casual jobs, she worked as an assistant nurse in the [[sanatorium]] of the SS for two years and unsuccessfully tried to find an apprenticeship as a nurse.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Concentration camp guard==
By the time she was a teen, Irma devoted herself to the Nazi cause and trained to become a nurse,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} but after a series of failures,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} she became obsessed with the [[Hitler Youth]] and the League of German Girls.&lt;ref name="sarti"/&gt;

By the time she was eighteen, she had moved to the SS Female Helpers’ training base, which was located near Ravensbrück, the all-female concentration camp.&lt;ref name=KaterP70/&gt; After her training, which stressed "the feminine ideal of nurturance",{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} she volunteered to work at Ravensbrück. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

She was soon promoted to a guard position at Auschwitz-Birkenau. From mid-1942 she was an ''[[Aufseherin]]'' (guard) at Ravensbrück, and in March 1943 she transferred to Auschwitz-Birkenau. In the second half of 1944 she was promoted to ''Rapportführerin'', the second-highest rank open to female KZ-wardens.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Soon after gaining power, she developed a reputation as a sadist.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} She was considered to be a nymphomaniac who slept with SS guards as well as prisoners—the latter{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}, forcibly. She bribed &lt;!-- bribed???? FORCED, more likely --&gt;young Jewish girls to stand watch for her as she raped other inmates, and, according to inmate and doctor [[Gisella Perl]], Grese "relished whipping well-developed young women on the breasts… Grese would eventually become sexually aroused just watching the women suffering."&lt;ref name="sarti"&gt;Sarti, Wendy Adele-Marie. ''Women and Nazis''. Bethesda: Academica Press, 2012.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Author Wendy Adele-Marie Sarti wrote in her book ''Women and Nazis'' that she beat prisoners until their faces were completely raw, kicked them with her hobnailed jackboots until blood flowed, used her dog on the prisoners, forced men and women to hold rocks above their heads and kneel for hours at a time, and had a "whip which [she] used consistently whenever necessary."&lt;ref name="sarti"/&gt;

Grese participated in prisoner selections for the gas chambers at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name="New Exhibition Guide"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bergen-Belsen: Wehrmacht POW Camp 1940–1945, Concentration Camp 1943–1945, Displaced Persons Camp 1945–1950. Catalogue of the permanent exhibition|publisher=Wallstein|year=2010|isbn=978-3-8353-0794-0|editor-last=Knoch|editor-first=Habbo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|219}} Prisoner [[Olga Lengyel]] wrote in her memoir ''[[Five Chimneys]]'' that selections in the women's camp were made by SS ''Aufseherin'' [[Elisabeth Hasse]] and Irma Grese (spelled ''Griese'' in Lengyel's account). The latter was visibly pleased by the terror her presence inspired in the women at roll call. Grese had a penchant for selecting not only the sick and the weak but any woman who had retained vestiges of her former beauty. Lengyel said Grese had several lovers among the SS in the camp, including [[Josef Mengele]]. After Grese forced the inmate surgeon at the infirmary into performing her illegal abortion, she disclosed that she planned a career in film acting after the war. Lengyel felt that Grese’s meticulous grooming, custom-fitted clothes and overuse of perfume were part of a deliberate act of sadism directed toward the ragged women prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Five Chimneys|last=Lengyel|first=Olga|publisher=Academy Chicago|year=1995|isbn=978-0-89733-376-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1945, Grese accompanied a prisoner evacuation transport from Auschwitz to Ravensbrück. In March 1945, she went to Bergen-Belsen along with a large number of prisoners from Ravensbrück.&lt;ref name="New Exhibition Guide"/&gt;{{rp|219}} Grese was captured by the [[British Army]] on 17 April 1945, together with other SS personnel who did not flee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Celinscak|first=Mark|title=Distance from the Belsen Heap: Allied Forces and the Liberation of a Concentration Camp|year=2015|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9781442615700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War crimes trial==
[[File:The Liberation of Bergen-belsen Concentration Camp 1945- Portraits of Belsen Guards at Celle Awaiting Trial, August 1945 BU9745.jpg|thumb|right|Irma Grese and [[Josef Kramer]] in prison in [[Celle]] in August 1945]]
Grese was among the 45 people accused of war crimes at the [[Belsen Trial]]. She was tried over the first period of the trials (17 September – 17 November 1945) and was represented by Major L. Cranfield. The trials were conducted under British [[military law]] in [[Lüneburg]], based on charges derived from the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention of 1929]] regarding the treatment of prisoners. The accusations against her centered on her ill-treatment and murder of those imprisoned at the camps.&lt;ref name="Nizkor.org"/&gt; 

Survivors provided detailed testimony of murders, tortures, and other cruelties, especially towards women, in which Grese engaged during her years at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. They testified to acts of sadism, beatings, and arbitrary shootings of prisoners, savaging of prisoners by her trained and allegedly half-starved dogs,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and her selecting prisoners for the gas chambers. Grese was reported to have habitually worn heavy boots and carried a whip and a pistol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Witnesses testified that she took pleasure in using physical and psychological methods to torture camp inmates and enjoyed shooting prisoners [[wikt:in cold blood|in cold blood]]. They also claimed that she beat some women to death and flogged others using a plaited whip.&lt;ref name="Nizkor.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/camps/bergen-belsen/belsen-trial-05.html|title=Excerpts from The Belsen Trial (5/5)|website=Nizkor.org|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under direct examination, Irma Grese testified about her background,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I was born on 7 October 1923. In 1938 I left the elementary school and worked for six months on agricultural jobs at a farm, after which I worked in a shop in [[Lychen]] for six months. When I was 15 I went to a [[Hohenlychen Sanatorium|hospital in Hohenlychen]], where I stayed for two years. I tried to become a nurse but the Labor Exchange would not allow that and sent me to work in a dairy in [[Fürstenberg/Havel|Fürstenberg]]. In July 1942, I tried again to become a nurse, but the Labour Exchange sent me to Ravensbrück Concentration Camp, although I protested against it. I stayed there until March 1943, when I went to Birkenau Camp in Auschwitz. I remained in Auschwitz until January 1945.&lt;ref name="Nizkor.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the trial the press labelled Grese as "the Beautiful Beast" alongside Kommandant Josef Kramer ("the Beast of Belsen"). After a nine-week trial, Grese was sentenced to death by hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1945/12/14/Belsen-Beast-Irma-Grese-hanged-with-nine-other-horror-camp-aides/9191481832607|publisher=UPI|title=Belsen Beast, Irma Grese hanged with nine other horror camp aides|date=14 December 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the charges against some of the other female wardens (a total of 16 were charged) were as serious as those against Grese, she was one of only three female guards to be sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="New Exhibition Guide"/&gt;{{rp|219}}

==Execution==
Grese and two other concentration camp workers, [[Juana Bormann|Johanna Bormann]] and [[Elisabeth Volkenrath]], were convicted along with eight men for crimes committed at Auschwitz and Belsen and [[death sentence|sentenced to death]]. As the verdicts were read, Grese was the only prisoner to remain defiant.&lt;ref&gt;"Verdicts in the Belsen Trial", ''[[The Times]]'', 17 November 1945, pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Her subsequent [[appeal]] was rejected.

According to Wendy Adele-Marie Sarti, the night before her execution, Grese sang [[Nazi songs]] until the early hours of the morning with Johanna Bormann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last1=Sarti|first1=Wendy Adele-Marie|title=Women and Nazis|publication-place=Bethesda|publisher=Academica Press|date=2012|isbn=978-1936320127}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Thursday, 13 December 1945, in {{ill|Hamelin prison|de|Gefängnis Hameln}}, Grese was led to the [[gallows]]. The women were executed singly by [[Hanging#Long drop|long-drop hanging]] and then the men in pairs.&lt;ref&gt;The Times; ''Belsen Gang Hanged''; 15 December 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Regimental Sergeant Major Richard Anthony O'Neill assisted the British [[executioner]], [[Albert Pierrepoint]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;We climbed the stairs to the cells where the condemned were waiting. A German officer at the door leading to the corridor flung open the door and we filed past the row of faces and into the execution chamber. The officers stood at attention. Brigadier Paton-Walsh stood with his wristwatch raised. He gave me the signal, and a sigh of released breath was audible in the chamber, I walked into the corridor. 'Irma Grese', I called. The German guards quickly closed all grilles on twelve of the inspection holes and opened one door. Irma Grese stepped out. The cell was far too small for me to go inside, and I had to pinion her in the corridor. 'Follow me,' I said in English, and O'Neil [sic] repeated the order in German. At 9.34 a.m. she walked into the execution chamber, gazed for a moment at the officials standing round it, then walked on to the centre of the trap, where I had made a chalk mark. She stood on this mark very firmly, and as I placed the white cap over her head she said in her languid voice, 'Schnell'. [English translation: 'Quickly'].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=26 September 2012|title=Nazi She-Devils|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nazi-she-devils-566055|journal=Mirror|date=21 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The drop crashed down, and the doctor followed me into the pit and pronounced her dead. After twenty minutes the body was taken down and placed in a coffin ready for burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Executioner|last=Pierrepoint|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Pierrepoint|year=1974|publisher=Harrap|isbn=978-0-245-52070-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Dramatizations==
Grese has been portrayed as a minor character in two films: ''[[Pierrepoint (film)|Pierrepoint]]'' (2005), which portrays her execution following the Belsen war crimes trial; and ''[[Out of the Ashes (2003 film)|Out of the Ashes]]'' (2003). Both films feature additional female guards in much smaller roles. Grese was briefly portrayed in a nonspeaking reenactment in ''[[Auschwitz: The Nazis and the 'Final Solution']]''  (2005).

After leaving his position in 2010, Adams accused the department of [[racial bias]] in its handling of a [[New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case|voter intimidation case]] against members of the [[New Black Panther Party]]; an internal review by the DOJ Inspector General concluded that opposition to race neutral enforcement of voting laws was widespread in the DOJ Voting Section though particular decisions about the New Black Panther case were defensible.&lt;ref&gt;https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2013/s1303.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since leaving the DOJ, Adams has become notable for making claims substantiated by original government records about the extent of [[voter fraud in the United States]]. His organization has published a report detailing extensive non-citizen registration and voting in multiple states.  In Virginia, his organization found over 5,500 registrations that were cancelled because of citizenship defects.&lt;ref&gt;https://pjmedia.com/jchristianadams/2016/10/03/yes-virginia-aliens-are-registered-and-voting-and-in-pennsylvania-by-the-thousands/&lt;/ref&gt;  The report republished extensive government records of non-citizen cancellation actions, including full names and detailed information on the registration forms.&lt;ref&gt;https://publicinterestlegal.org/files/Alien-Invasion-II-FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams is affiliated with an organization that found extensive non-citizen voting in New Jersey, including one alien who was illegally registered three times simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;https://publicinterestlegal.org/blog/garden-state-gotcha-how-opponents-of-citizenship-verification-for-voting-are-putting-new-jerseys-noncitizens-at-risk-of-deportation/&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization published original voter registration and election records detailing the government records that substantiate the claim of alien registration and voting.&lt;ref&gt;https://publicinterestlegal.org/blog/report-noncitizens-discovered-new-jersey-voter-registration-system/&lt;/ref&gt;
==Career==
Adams grew up in [[Hempfield Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Hempfield Township]] in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]] and graduated from [[Hempfield Area High School]].&lt;ref name="lawyer bashes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gazarik|first=Richard|title=Lawyer bashes Obama officials over Philadelphia voter-intimidation case|url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_688661.html|accessdate=July 7, 2012|newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[English language|English]] from [[West Virginia University]], then his [[juris doctor]] from the [[University of South Carolina School of Law]] in 1993, and was admitted to the [[South Carolina Bar]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Justice Department and the New Black Panthers Voting Rights Controversy|url=http://www.fed-soc.org/events/detail/the-justice-department-and-the-new-black-panthers-voting-rights-controversy|publisher=Federalist Society|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Christian Adams search|url=http://www.scbar.org/MemberResources/MemberDirectory.aspx|publisher=South Carolina Bar|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1993 to 1997, Adams served as counsel for [[Jim Miles (politician)|Jim Miles]], the [[Secretary of State of South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="off the hook"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brundrett|first=Rick|title=Supreme Court not off the hook|url=http://www.thestate.com/local/story/245780.html|newspaper=The State|place=[[Columbia, South Carolina]]|date=December 2, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204044642/http://www.thestate.com/local/story/245780.html|archivedate=December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, the [[Virginia State Bar]] admitted Adams.&lt;ref name="Avvo"/&gt; Adams is an Eagle Scout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama’s Choice: 100th Anniversary of the Boy Scouts, or Joy Behar?|url=http://pjmedia.com/blog/obamas-choice-100th-anniversary-of-the-boy-scouts-or-joy-behar/?singlepage=true|publisher=PJ Media.|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Times]]'' noted in February 2001 that Adams filed a formal ethics complaint with the [[Florida Bar]] against [[Hugh Edwin Rodham|Hugh Rodham]], brother of then-[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Hillary Clinton]], that accused Rodham of violating bar regulations by representing people considered for [[presidential pardon]] from former president [[Bill Clinton]], husband of Hillary Rodham Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCaslin|first=John|title=Inside the beltway|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2001/feb/26/20010226-021251-9747r/?page=all|work=The Washington Times|date=February 26, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010303075302/http://www.washtimes.com/national/inbeltway-200122621315.htm|archivedate=March 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing [[United States Department of Justice]] confidentiality rules, the Florida Bar ruled that Hugh Rodham did not violate any rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCaslin|first=John|title=Inside the beltway|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2001/jul/26/20010726-024433-6310r/?page=all|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=July 26, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010730040428/http://www.washtimes.com/national/20010726-13951230.htm|archivedate=July 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams responded to the Bar by emphasizing that his complaint accused Rodham of illegally taking a [[contingent fee]] to represent the two clients appealing for a pardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCaslin|first=John|title=Inside the beltway|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2001/jul/30/20010730-024520-1475r/?page=all|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=July 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported in 2003 that the [[Transportation Security Administration]] falsely placed Adams in a [[No Fly List]] along with other people with names like "J. Adams".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gathright |first=Alan |title=No-fly list ensnares innocent travelers |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/No-fly-list-ensnares-innocent-travelers-2610926.php |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=June 8, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030620164636/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2003%2F06%2F08%2FMN253740.DTL |archivedate=June 20, 2003 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, [[Columbia, South Carolina]] newspaper ''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'' reported that Adams called on increased oversight of the [[South Carolina Supreme Court]] in response to a controversy over the court reversing the grades of 20 who failed the bar exam.&lt;ref name="off the hook"/&gt;

===Justice Department Civil Rights Division===
{{see also|New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case}}
The [[United States Department of Justice]] Civil Rights Division under the [[George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States|George W. Bush administration]] hired Adams in 2005.&lt;ref name="voting section chief out"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainjustice.com/2009/12/27/voting-section-chief-out-amid-controversy/|title=Voting Section Chief Out Amid Controversy – Main Justice|last=Reilly|first=Ryan J.|date=|publisher=Mainjustice.com|accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Adams was one of three federal attorneys probing [[Lake Park, Florida]] for possible bias against African-Americans being elected to town commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dubocq|first=Tom|title=Feds probe possible racial bias in Lake Park voting|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2008/07/19/m1a_justice_0720.html|newspaper=Palm Beach Post|date=July 20, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904223708/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2008/07/19/m1a_justice_0720.html|archivedate=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Adams's supervisor and Civil Rights Division attorney [[Christopher Coates]] stepped down as chief of the voting division in December 2009 amid controversy over his objections to the dropping of the [[New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case]]. Coates' testimony before the [[United States Civil Rights Commission]] supported Adams' allegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Foster, Daniel|title=Coates Testifies at Civil Rights Commission|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/247747/coates-testifies-civil-rights-commission-daniel-foster|work=The Corner|publisher=National Review Online|date=September 24, 2010|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Commission's report that found "a cover-up of a possible racial double standard in law enforcement in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice," and, detailing "a year of DOJ’s intransigence and baseless refusals to comply with our subpoenas," that "the Department of Justice is unquestionably hostile to any serious investigation of these allegations."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Race Neutral Enforcement of the Law? The U.S. Department of Justice and the New Black Panther Party Litigation: An Interim Report|url=http://www.usccr.gov/NBPH/USCCR_NBPP_report.pdf|publisher=US Commission of Civil Rights|date=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, Adams resigned from the Justice Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reilly|first=Ryan J.|title=DOJ lawyer who brought Black Panthers case resigns|url=http://www.mainjustice.com/2010/05/18/doj-lawyer-who-brought-black-panthers-case-resigns/|work=Main Justice|accessdate=July 7, 2012|date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later internal review by the Department of justice concluded that the dismissal of some charges in the Black Panthers intimidation case was "based on a good-faith assessment of the law and facts of the case" and found "no evidence that partisan politics was a motivating factor in reaching the decision."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/vote-fraud-crusader-j-christian-adams-sparks-outrage-n796026|title=Vote fraud crusader J.

===Post-Justice Department career===
After leaving the Justice Department, Adams became a contributor to [[Pajamas Media]].&lt;ref name="lawyer bashes"/&gt; He has been a guest commentator for [[Fox News]], Rush Limbaugh's [http://dailyrushbo.com DailyRushbo.com], [[the Heritage Foundation]], [[Newsmax TV]] and other conservative media. On June 28, 2010, ''[[The Washington Times]]'' published a guest commentary by Adams in which Adams accused the Justice Department of racial bias by dropping the New Black Panthers case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adams, J. Christian|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jun/25/inside-the-black-panther-case-anger-ignorance-and-/?page=all |title=Inside the Black Panther case |publisher=Washington Times |date=June 28, 2010|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Adams accused Assistant Attorney General [[Thomas Perez]] of [[perjury|lying under oath]] in investigative hearings before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.&lt;ref name="lawyer bashes"/&gt; On July 6, 2010, Adams testified before the Commission on Civil Rights that the Justice Department's decision was driven by racial bias against white Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Racial Motive Alleged in a Justice Dept. Decision|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/us/07rights.html|accessdate=July 7, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department Inspector General also concluded that a pervasive hostility toward race neutral enforcement of voting laws existed in the DOJ Voting Section.&lt;ref&gt;https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2013/s1303.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Virginia Republican primary, 2012|2012 Republican presidential primaries in Virginia]], Adams represented candidate [[Michele Bachmann]] in a multi-candidate lawsuit to add Bachmann and others to the primary ballot in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Tim|last2=Millard|first2=Mike|title=Virginia’s Cuccinelli Opposes Changes to March Primary Rules|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-06/virginia-s-cuccinelli-opposes-changes-to-march-primary-rules.html|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=July 8, 2012|date=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachmann and the other candidates lost the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kumar|first=Anita|title=Perry, Gingrich lose lawsuit to get on Virginia primary ballot|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/perry-gingrich-lose-lawsuit-to-get-on-virginia-primary-ballot/2012/01/13/gIQANoIExP_story.html|accessdate=July 8, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Claims about voter fraud ====
Adams advocates for stricter voter ID laws, and has without evidence asserted that there is an "alien invasion" at the voting booth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to ''NBC News'', "he's spent years suing counties to force them to purge their rolls and he's published personal information online about thousands of registered voters he believes could have committed fraud."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Adams has described those who say there is no way to improve the integrity of the electoral system without cancelling the registrations of legitimate voters as "flat-earthers".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He has called those who deny the existence of voter fraud as "voter fraud deniers."  In 2017, Adams was chosen by President Donald Trump to be a member of his election integrity commission.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Adams opposes automatic voter registration, saying that voter registration should require "forethought and initiative, something lacking in large segments of the Democrat base."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Adams is affiliated with an organization that found extensive non-citizen voting in New Jersey, including one alien who was illegally registered three times simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;https://publicinterestlegal.org/blog/garden-state-gotcha-how-opponents-of-citizenship-verification-for-voting-are-putting-new-jerseys-noncitizens-at-risk-of-deportation/&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization published original voter registration and election records detailing the government records that substantiate the claim of alien registration and voting.&lt;ref&gt;https://publicinterestlegal.org/blog/report-noncitizens-discovered-new-jersey-voter-registration-system/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kidnapping of foreign children by Nazi Germany''' ({{lang-pl|Rabunek dzieci}}), part of the [[Generalplan Ost]] (GPO), involved taking children regarded as "Aryan-looking" from the rest of Europe and moving them to [[Nazi Germany]] for the purpose of [[Germanisation|Germanization]], or indoctrination into becoming culturally German.

At more than 200,000 victims, occupied Poland had the largest proportion of children taken.&lt;ref name=Berghahn&gt;Volker R. Berghahn, "Germans and Poles 1871–1945", in ''Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identities and Cultural Differences''.

The aim of the project was to acquire and "[[Germanisation#Under the Third Reich|Germanize]]" children with purportedly [[Aryan race|Aryan]]-[[Nordic race|Nordic]] traits, who were considered by Nazi officials to be descendants of German settlers that had emigrated to Poland.

==Historical contexts==
{{See also|Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles}}
In a well-known speech to his military commanders at Obersalzberg on 22 August 1939, Adolf Hitler condoned the killing without pity or mercy of all men, women, and children of Polish race or language.&lt;ref name =Milton&gt;{{cite web | author = Sybil Milton|url=http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&amp;b=395115|title=Non-Jewish Children in the Camps|work = Multimedia Learning Center Online (Annual 5, Chapter 2)| year = 1997 |publisher= The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]|accessdate= 2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 November 1939, Hitler decreed that [[Heinrich Himmler]], whose German title at that time was Reichskomissar für die Festigung deutschen Volkstums, would be responsible for policy regarding the population of occupied territories. The plan to kidnap Polish children most likely was created in a document titled ''Rassenpolitisches Amt der NSDAP''.&lt;ref name=Hrabar28/&gt;

On 25 November 1939, Himmler was sent a 40-page document titled (in English translation) "The issue of the treatment of population in former Polish territories from a racial-political view."&lt;ref name=Hrabar28&gt;{{cite book|author=Roman Zbigniew Hrabar|title=Hitlerowski rabunek dzieci polskich: Uprowadzanie i germanizowanie dzieci polskich w latach 1939-1945 | publisher=Śląski Instytut Naukowy w Katowicach, Katowice: Wydawnictwo Śląsk | year = 1960|page =28 | language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last chapter of the document concerns "racially valuable" Polish children and plans to forcefully acquire them for German plans and purposes:

{{quote|we should exclude from deportations racially valuable children and raise them in old Reich in proper educational facilities or in German family care. The children must not be older than eight or ten years, because only till this age we can truly change their national identification, that is "final Germanization". A condition for this is complete separation from any Polish relatives. Children will be given German names, their ancestry will be led by special office.&lt;ref name=Hrabar28/&gt;}}

On 15 May 1940, in a document titled (in German) ''Einige Gedanken ueber die Behandlung der Fremdenvoelker im Osten'' ("A Few Thoughts about the Treatment of Racial Aliens in the East"), and in another "top-secret memorandum with limited distribution, dated 25 May 1940", titled (in English translation) "The Treatment of Racial Aliens in the East", Himmler defined special directives for the kidnapping of Polish children.&lt;ref name=Milton/&gt;&lt;ref name = Hrabar29&gt;{{cite book|author=Roman Zbigniew Hrabar|title = Hitlerowski rabunek dzieci polskich: Uprowadzanie i germanizowanie dzieci polskich w latach 1939-1945 |publisher=Śląski Instytut Naukowy w Katowicach, Katowice: Wydawnictwo Śląsk | year = 1960 |page = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Himmler "also outlined the administration of incorporated Poland and the [[General Government]], where Poles were to be assigned to compulsory labor, and racially selected children were to be abducted and Germanized."&lt;ref name=Milton/&gt;

Among Himmler's core points:&lt;ref name=Hrabar28/&gt;
*In the territory of Poland, only four [[Primary school|grade schools]] would remain, in which education would be strictly limited. Children would be taught to count only to 500, to write their own name, and that God commanded Poles to serve Germans. Writing was determined to be unnecessary for the Polish population.
*Parents who desired better education for their children would have to apply to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and police for a special permit. The permit would be awarded to children deemed "racially valuable". Those children would be taken to Germany to be Germanised. Even then, the fate of each child would be determined by the loyalty and obedience to the German state of his or her parents. A child determined to be "of little racial value" would not receive any further education.
*Annual selection would be made every year among children from six to ten years of age according to German racial standards. Children deemed adequately German would be taken to Germany, given new names and further Germanised.&lt;ref name = Hrabar28/&gt;  The aim of the plan was to destroy "[[Poles|Polish]]" as an ethnic group, and leave within Poland a considerable slave population to be used up over the next 10 years. Within 15 to 20 years, Poles would be completely eradicated.&lt;ref name="Germany"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identities and Cultural Differences | first1 = Keith | last1 = Bullivant | first2 = Geoffrey J | last2 = Giles | first3 = Walter | last3 = Pape | publisher = Rodopi | year = 1999 | page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 1940, Hitler approved Himmler's directives, ordering copies to be sent to chief organs of the SS, to [[Gauleiter]]s in German-occupied territories in Central Europe, and to the governor of General Government, and commanding that the operation of kidnapping Polish children in order to seek Aryan descendants for Germanisation be a priority in those territories. Between 1940 and 1945, according to official Polish estimates, approximately 200,000 Polish children were abducted by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;''Nowa Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN'' (Warsaw: Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, 2004), 2: 613.  {{ISBN|83-01-14181-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madajczyk&gt;{{cite book|author = Czesław Madajczyk|title=Generalna Gubernia w planach hitlerowskich.

===Outside Poland===
Large numbers of children were also abducted from places other than Poland: about 20,000 children were taken from the Soviet Union and about 10,000 children were taken from Western and South Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=Moses260&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

Himmler mused on initiating similar projects in [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]].&lt;ref name="table"&gt;Hitler, Adolf; [[Gerhard Weinberg|Weinberg, Gerhard L.]] (2007). ''Hitler's table talk, 1941-1944: his private conversations'', p. 303. Enigma Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hitler's Table Talk]] records him expressing his belief that "the [[France|French]] problem" would be best solved by yearly extractions of a number of racially healthy children, chosen from "France's Germanic population". He preferred they be placed in German [[boarding school]]s, in order to separate them from their "incidental" French nationality, and to make them aware of their "Germanic blood". Hitler responded that the "religious [[petit-bourgeois]] tendencies of the French people" would make it almost impossible to "salvage the Germanic elements from the claws of the [[ruling class]] of that country".&lt;ref name="table"/&gt; [[Martin Bormann]] believed it to be an ingenious policy, [[Note (typography)|noting]] it in the document record as a [sic] "sinister theory!".&lt;ref name="table"/&gt;

==Conditions of transfer==
[[File:Kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi-German occupants (Zamojszczyzna).jpg|thumb|250px|Kidnapping of Polish children during the Nazi-German resettlement operation in [[Zamość]] county.]]
{{See also|Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|Ethnic cleansing of Zamojszczyzna by Nazi Germany}}

A large percentage of children were kidnapped during expulsions of Poles by Nazi Germany as part of [[Lebensraum]] policy. In the [[Zamość County]] alone, some 30,000 children were apprehended.&lt;ref name="IPN2003"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Polacy wypędzeni |publisher=Biuletyn Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej, Pamięć.pl |volume=5 |issue=40 |date=May 2004 |pages=18–22 (16–20/24 in PDF) |work=Dzieci Zamojszczyzny |author=Julian Grudzień |quote=... to co, się działo na Zamojszczyźnie, szczególnie w pierwszym rzucie wysiedleń, począwszy od listopada 1942 r. i zimą, do lutego 1943 r., to była sprawa wręcz nie do opowiedzenia; mróz sięgał trzydziestu stopni i poniżej.

The conditions of transfer were very harsh, as the children did not receive food or water for many days.&lt;ref name="lukas22"&gt;Richard C. Lukas, ''Forgotten Holocaust'' p. 22, {{ISBN|0-7818-0528-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many children died as a result of suffocation in the summer and cold in the winter.&lt;ref name="lukas22"/&gt; Polish railway workers, often risking their lives, tried to feed the imprisoned children or to give them warm clothes. Sometimes the German guards could be bribed with jewelry or gold to allow the supplies to go through, and in other cases they sold some of the children to Poles.&lt;ref name="lukas22"/&gt; In [[Bydgoszcz]] and [[Gdynia]], Poles bought children for 40 Reichsmarks. In some places the German price for a Polish child was 25 zlotys.&lt;ref name=Lukas/&gt;

The children were kidnapped by force, often after their parents had been murdered in concentration camps or shot as "partisans", including a handful of the children of [[Lidice]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn H. Nicholas]], ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 253-4 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These children would not be permitted to remain even with other living relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Lukas, ''Forgotten Holocaust'' p. 27, {{ISBN|0-7818-0528-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were purportedly from German soldiers and foreign mothers, and others were declared "German orphans" who had been raised by non-German families.&lt;ref name=Moses248&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

[[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, orphanages and children's homes, along with children living with [[foster parent]]s, were among the first groups targeted, in the belief that Poles deliberately and systemically Polonized ethnically German children.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 244-5 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  German foster parents were later told that children had received false Polish birth certificates to rob them of their German heritage.&lt;ref name=Sereny/&gt;

Later the children were sent to special centers and institutions or to, as Germans called them, "children education camps" (''Kindererziehungslager''), which, in reality, were selection camps where their "racial values" were tested, their original metrics of birth destroyed, and their Polish names changed to German names, as part of [[Germanisation]]. Those children who were classified as "of little value" were sent to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau|Auschwitz]] or to [[Treblinka]].&lt;ref name=Lukas/&gt;

==Selection==
[[File:Litzmannstadt Ghetto plan.svg|thumb|250px|Kinder-KZ inside [[Litzmannstadt Ghetto]] map signed with number 15; where Polish children were selected.]]
[[File:Polish children in Nazi-German labor camp in Dzierżązna.jpg|thumb|250px|Polish children in Nazi-German labor camp in Dzierżązna near [[Zgierz]].]]
{{see also|Kinder KZ|Untermensch}}

The children were placed in special temporary camps of the health department, or [[Lebensborn]] e.V., called in German ''Kindererziehungslager'' ("children's education camps"). Afterwards they went through special "quality selection" or "racial selection" — a detailed racial examination, combined with psychological tests and medical exams made by experts from [[SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt|RuSHA]] or doctors from [[Gesundheitsamt]] (health department). A child's "racial value" would determine to which of 11 racial types it was assigned, including 62 points assessing body proportions, eye color, hair color, and the shape of the skull.

During this testing process, children were divided into three groups (in English translation):
#"desired population growth" ({{lang|de|erwünschter Bevölkerungszuwachs}});
#"acceptable population growth" ({{lang|de|tragbarer Bevölkerungszuwachs}}); and
#"undesired population growth" ({{lang|de|unerwünschter Bevölkerungszuwachs}}).&lt;ref name=Hrabar43&gt;{{cite book|author=Roman Z.

The failures that could result in a child, otherwise fitting all racial criteria, into the second group included such traits as "round-headed" referring to [[Cephalic index|the skull shape]].&lt;ref name="Lynn H. Nicholas p 250"&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 250 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children could be declared the third group for [[tuberculosis]], "degenerate" skull shape, or for "Gypsy characteristics".&lt;ref name="cruel251"&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 251 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A girl who was later identified by a small birthmark would have been rejected had the birthmark been much larger.&lt;ref name=Sereny/&gt;

These racial exams determined the fate of children: whether they would be killed, or sent to concentration camps, or experience other consequences.  For example, after forcibly taking a child away from his or her parents, "medical exams" could be performed in secret and in disguise.&lt;ref name=Hrabar44&gt;{{cite book|author=Roman Z.

Many Nazis were astounded at the number of Polish children found to exhibit "Nordic" traits, but assumed that all such children were genuinely German children, who had been [[Polonization|Polonized]]; [[Hans Frank]] summoned up such views when he declared, "When we see a blue-eyed child we are surprised that she is speaking Polish."&lt;ref name=Lukas/&gt;  Among those children thought to be genuinely German were children whose parents had been executed for resisting Germanization.&lt;ref name=Gumkowkski&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |title=Hitler's Plans for Eastern Europe |author=Janusz Gumkowski and Kazimierz Leszczyński |location=Warsaw |publisher=Polonia Publishing House |year=1961 |accessdate=2008-09-22 |pages=7–33; 164–78 |work=Poland Under Nazi Occupation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527021449/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archivedate=2012-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German documentation==
Once selected, the children between six and twelve were sent to special homes.  Their names were altered to similar-sounding German ones.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H.

Nicholas p 250"/&gt;  In some cases, the efforts were so successful that the children lived and died believing themselves to be Germans.&lt;ref name=Lukas/&gt;
Very young children, between two and six, were sent to [[Lebensborn]] homes, which had originally been instituted to provide shelter for unwed mothers and illegitimate children deemed racially valuable. There, they would be observed for a period.&lt;ref name="Sereny"/&gt;

In either case, if they were not disqualified at the respective institution, they were placed for adoption. The Nazis would devise German names and new birth certificates to hide their pasts. In the process, they were referred to as "[[Polonization|Polonized]] German children" or "Children of German descent" or even "German orphans."&lt;ref name=Lukas/&gt; Orders forbade making the term "Germanizable Polish children" known to the public.&lt;ref name=Sereny/&gt; This was to prevent their being viewed as Poles by the people they met, and so stigmatized. Some parents were informed that the children's birth certificates had been falsified, to show them as Poles and rob them of their German heritage.&lt;ref name=Sereny/&gt; The authorities were reluctant to let the children be officially adopted, as the proceedings might reveal their Polish origin. Indeed, some children were maltreated when their adoptive parents learned that they were Polish.&lt;ref name=Gumkowkski/&gt;

Adoption was also problematic because surveillance or more information might reveal problems with the child.&lt;ref name="cruel251"/&gt;  When it was learned that Rosalie K's mother was epileptic, for instance, it was immediately concluded, despite the wishes of her German foster parents, that Germanization, education and adoption were therefore not justifiable.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 251-2 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When adoptive parents demanded adoption certificates, such records were forged for them.&lt;ref name="cruel251"/&gt;

==Murder of Zamość children in Auschwitz==
[[File:Czeslawa-Kwoka2.jpg|thumb|[[Czesława Kwoka]], one of many Polish children murdered at Auschwitz by the Nazis]]

At [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] 200 to 300 Polish children from the [[Zamość]] area were murdered by the Nazis by [[phenol]] injections. The child was placed on a stool, occasionally blindfolded with a piece of a towel. The person performing the execution then placed one of his hands on the back of the child's neck and another behind the shoulder blade. As the child's chest was thrust out a long needle was used to inject a toxic dose of phenol into the chest. The children usually died in minutes. A witness described the process as deadly efficient: "As a rule not even a moan would be heard. And they did not wait until the doomed person really died. During his agony, he was taken from both sides under the armpits and thrown into a pile of corpses in another room…  And the next victim took his place on the stool."&lt;ref name=Lukas41&gt;{{Cite book | first = Richard C | last = Lukas | title = Germanization  | url = http://www.projectinposterum.org/docs/lucas2.htm | work = Did the Children Cry?

To trick the soon-to-be murdered children into obedience Germans promised them that they would work at a brickyard. However another group of children, young boys by the age of 8 to 12, managed to warn their fellow child inmates by calling for help when they were being killed by the Nazis: "Mamo! Mamo!" ('Mum! Mum!'), the dying screams of the youngsters, were heard by several inmates and made an indelible haunting impression on them.'"&lt;ref name=Lukas41/&gt;

Some of the children were also murdered in Auschwitz [[gas chamber]]s; others died as a result of the camp conditions.&lt;ref name=Block6&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.auschwitz.org.pl/new/index.php?language=EN&amp;tryb=stale&amp;id=442|title=Block no. 6: Exhibition: The Life of the Prisoners |publisher=Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, Poland|accessdate=2008-09-03|quote=Part of the exhibition in Block 6.

==German medical experiments on kidnapped children==
Those children who did not pass harsh Nazi exams and criteria and who were therefore selected during the operation, were sent as test subjects for experiments in special centers.&lt;ref name=Uzarczyk&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamila Uzarczyk|title=Podstawy ideologiczne higieny ras|publisher=Toruń: Wydawnictwo Adam Marszałek, 2002|pages=285–89|isbn=83-7322-287-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children sent there ranged from eight months to 18 years. Two such centres were located in German-occupied Poland. One of them, Medizinische Kinderheilanstalt, was in [[Lubliniec]] in [[Upper Silesia]] – in this centre children were also subject to forced "[[euthanasia]]";&lt;ref name=Uzarczyk/&gt; while the second was located in [[Cieszyn]]. Children were given [[psychoactive]] drugs, chemicals and other substances for medical tests, although it was generally known that the true purpose of those procedures was their mass extermination.&lt;ref name=Uzarczyk/&gt;

Weaker children subject to experiments usually died in a relatively short time from doses of drugs, and those that survived brought great curiosity; all side effects were recorded as well as their behavior. As most died, the documentation was forged to conceal traces of experiments, for example, giving the cause of death as from a lung infection or a weak heart. Based on statistics of deaths in the special camp in [[Lublin]], it was estimated that from the 235 children between ages 10 to 14 who received shots of the [[barbiturate]] [[Phenobarbital|Luminal]], 221 died.&lt;ref name=Uzarczyk/&gt; From August 1942 until November 1944, 94 percent of children who had been subjected to German medical experiments died.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Heuaktion==
{{main|Heuaktion}}
In a plan called "[[Heuaktion]]", described in a "top secret" memorandum submitted to German [[Interior Minister]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] on  10 June 1944, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]&amp;ndash;[[Obergruppenfuehrer]] [[Gottlob Berger]] — Chief of the Political Directing Staff (head of the SS main leadership office in Berlin), a co-author of Himmler's pamphlet ''Der [[Untermensch]]'', and a promoter of the pamphlet ''Mit Schwert und Wiege'' (''With Sword and Cradle'') for the recruitment of non-Germans — proposed that the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 9th Army]] "evacuate" 40,000–50,000 children between 10 and 14 from the "territory of Army Group 'Center'&amp;nbsp;" to work for the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref name=Avalon&gt;{{cite book| title = Memorandum: Re: Evacuation of youths from the territory of Army Group "Center" (Heu-Aktion)| url = http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/document/031-ps.htm| work = The Avalon Project: Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression| volume = 2| publisher = [[The Avalon Project]] ([[Yale University]])| date = 1944-06-12| accessdate = 2008-09-24| quote = Translation of Document 031-PS: Chief of the Political Directing Staff, personal referee, Berlin, 12 June 1944: TOP SECRET: Copy No. 1 of 2 copies: The Army Group 'Center' has the intention to apprehend 40–50,000 youths at the ages of 10 to 14 who are in the Army Territories, and to transport them to the Reich. This measure was originally proposed by the 9th Army. These youths cause considerable inconvenience in the Theatre of Operations. To the greater part these youths are without supervision of their parents since men and women in the theatres of operations have been and will be conscripted into labor battalions to be used in the construction of fortifications. Therefore Children's Villages are to be established behind the front, for the younger age groups, and under native supervision. To collect adequate experiences the 9th Army has already established such a Children's Village and has achieved good results also from the political viewpoint. Army Group further emphasizes that these youths must not be allowed! [sic] to fall into the hands of the [[Bolshevik]]s in case of a withdrawal since that would amount to reinforcing the enemy's potential war strength. This measure is to be strongly fortified by propaganda under the slogan: Care of the Reich for White-Ruthenian Children, Protection against Brigandry. The action has already started in the 5 kilometer zone. The Youth Bureau has already had preliminary talks with the Organization Todt and with the Junkers works. It is intended to allot these juveniles primarily to the German trades as apprentices to be used as skilled workers after 2 years' training. This is to be arranged through the Organization Todt which is especially equipped for such a task through its technical and other set-ups.

Heuaktion was not widely implemented, due in part perhaps to the following arguments against it: "The Minister [Himmler] feared that the action would have most unfavorable political consequences, that it would be regarded as abduction of children, and that the juveniles did not represent a real asset to the enemy's military strength anyhow.... The Minister would like to see the action confined to the 15–17 year olds."&lt;ref name=Avalon/&gt; Between March and October 1944, however, 28,000 children between the ages of 10 and 18 were deported from [[Belarus]] for work in the German arms industry.&lt;ref name=Knoll&gt;{{cite book |author=Harald Knoll |title=Späte Heimkehr Als Kriegsverbrecher verurteilte österreichische Kriegsgefangene in der Sowjetunion 1944 bis 1953 |work=Kriegsgefangene des Zweiten Weltkrieges: Gefangennahme, Lagerleben, Rückkehr : zehn Jahre Ludwig Boltzmann-Institut für Kriegsfolgen-Forschung |editors=[[Günter Bischof]], Stefan Karner, Barbara Stelzl-Marx, Edith Petschnigg |at=p. 177 (pp. 167–183) |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5M4WAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Wei%C3%9Frussland+28.000 |publisher=Munich and Wien: Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag |year=2005 |isbn=3486578189 |via=[[Google Books]] snippet; no Limited preview available}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Richter&gt;{{cite book |author=Timm C.

==Post-war==
The extent of the program became clear to Allied forces over the course of months, as they found groups of "Germanized" children and became aware that many more were in the German population.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 501-2 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locating these children turned up their stories of forcible instruction in the German language and how the failures were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 502 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teams were constituted to search for the children, a particularly important point when dealing with institutions, where a single investigator could only interview a few children before all the rest were coached to provide false information.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 505 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many children had to be lured into speaking the truth; as for instance complimenting their German and asking how long they had spoken it, and only when told that a nine-year-old had spoken German for four years, pointing out that they must have spoken before then, whereupon the child could be brought to admit to having spoken Polish.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 506 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some children suffered emotional trauma when they were removed from their adoptive German parents, often the only parents they remembered, and returned to their biological parents, when they no longer remembered Polish, only German.&lt;ref name=Sereny/&gt; The older children generally remembered Poland; ones as young as ten had forgotten much, but could often be reminded by such things as Polish nursery rhymes; the youngest had no memories that could be recalled.&lt;ref name=Sereny/&gt;

Allied forces made efforts to repatriate them.&lt;ref name="cruel479"/&gt;  However, many children, particularly Polish and Yugoslavian who were among the first taken, declared on being found that they were German.&lt;ref name="cruel479"&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 479 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russian and Ukrainian children, while not gotten to this stage, still had been taught to hate their native countries and did not want to return.&lt;ref name="cruel479"/&gt;  While many foster parents voluntarily brought forth well-cared-for children, other children proved to be abused or used for labor, and still others went to great efforts to hide the children.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 508-9 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, The United States of America v. [[Ulrich Greifelt]], et al., or the [[RuSHA Trial]], the eighth of the twelve [[Nuremberg Trials]], dealt with the kidnapping of children by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 507 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many children testified, although many of their parents were afraid to let them return to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 507-8 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1947 to 1948, the [[Nuremberg Trials]] ruled that the abductions, exterminations, and Germanization constituted [[genocide]].&lt;ref name=Greifetetal&gt;{{cite web |title= Trial of Ulrich Greifelt and Others, United States Military Tribunal, Nuremberg, 10 October 1947 – 10 March 1948, Part IV|url=http://164.11.131.30/WCC/greifelt4.htm|quote= [T]he crime of genocide… was taken by the prosecution and the Tribunal as a general concept defining the background of the total range of specific offences committed by the accused, which in themselves constitute crimes against humanity and/or war crimes.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611031358/http://164.11.131.30/WCC/greifelt4.htm|archivedate=2007-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 513 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today in Germany, it is believed that hundreds of thousands of Germans might be descended from kidnapped Polish children. However it is very unlikely that people are aware of having hidden Polish ancestry, and cases of having any such knowledge are extremely rare.{{Citation needed|reason=Such a bold statement could really do with a source|date=December 2016}}

'''Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar, Prince von Metternich-Winneburg zu Beilstein''', [[Order of the Golden Fleece|KOGF]] ({{IPA-de|ˈmɛtɐnɪç|lang}}; 15 May 1773 – 11 June 1859)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=5–6, 339}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Austrian diplomat who was at the center of European affairs for four decades as the [[Austrian Empire]]'s foreign minister from 1809 and [[List of Ministers-President of Austria|Chancellor]] from 1821 until the liberal [[Revolutions of 1848]] forced his resignation.

One of his first assignments was to engineer a [[détente]] with France that included the marriage of [[Napoleon]] to the Austrian archduchess [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]]. Soon after, he engineered Austria's entry into the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] on the Allied side, signed the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] that sent Napoleon into exile and led the Austrian delegation at the [[Congress of Vienna]] that divided post-Napoleonic Europe amongst the major powers. For his service to the Austrian Empire, he was given the title of Prince in October 1813. Under his guidance, the "[[Metternich system]]" of international congresses continued for another decade as Austria aligned itself with Russia and to a lesser extent Prussia. This marked the high point of Austria's diplomatic importance and thereafter Metternich slowly slipped into the periphery of international diplomacy. At home, Metternich held the post of Chancellor of State from 1821 until 1848 under both [[Francis I of Austria|Francis I]] and his son [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]]. After a brief exile in London, Brighton, and Brussels that lasted until 1851, he returned to the Viennese court, this time to offer only advice to Ferdinand's successor, [[Franz Josef I of Austria|Franz Josef]]. Having outlived his generation of politicians, Metternich died at the age of 86 in 1859.

Born in 1773 into the family of a prosperous and well-connected, if relatively minor, [[Rhenish]] nobility,&lt;ref&gt;Ryan M. Nadeau, [https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.ca/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1148&amp;context=ghj "Creating a Statesman: The Early Life of Prince Clemens von Metternich and its Effect on his Political Philosophy"], ''The Gettysburg Historical Journal'', volume 15, 2016, p. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; the son of a diplomat, he was named after his godfather, [[Prince Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony|Clement-Wenceslas, Archbishop of Trier]]. Metternich received a good education at the universities of [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] and [[University of Mainz|Mainz]]. He was of help during the coronation of Francis II in 1792 and that of his predecessor, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], in 1790. After a brief trip to England, Metternich was named as the Austrian ambassador to the Netherlands, a short-lived post since the country was brought under French control the next year. He married his first wife, Eleonore von Kaunitz (a descendant of [[Karolina of Legnica-Brieg]]) in 1795, which aided his entry into Viennese society. Despite having numerous affairs, he was devastated by her death in 1825. His second marriage was to Baroness Antoinette Leykam in 1827 and following her death in 1829 married Countess Melanie Zichy-Ferraris in 1831. She predeceased him by five years. Before taking office as Foreign Minister, Metternich held numerous smaller posts, including ambassadorial roles in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and Napoleonic France. One of Metternich's sons, [[Richard von Metternich]], was also a successful diplomat and many of Metternich's twelve other acknowledged children predeceased him. A [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservative]], Metternich was keen to maintain the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]], in particular by resisting Russian territorial ambitions in Central Europe and lands belonging to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He disliked [[liberalism]] and strove to prevent the breakup of the Austrian Empire, for example, by crushing [[nationalism|nationalist]] revolts in Austrian north Italy and the German states. At home, he pursued a similar policy, using [[censorship]] and a wide-ranging spy network to suppress unrest.

Metternich has been both praised and heavily criticized for the policies he pursued. His supporters point out that he presided over the "[[Age of Metternich]]", when international diplomacy helped prevent major wars in Europe. His qualities as a diplomat are commended, some noting that his achievements were considerable in light of the weakness of his negotiating position. His decision to oppose Russian expansionism is seen as a good one. His detractors describe him as a boor who stuck to ill-thought-out, conservative principles out of vanity and a sense of infallibility. They argue he could have done much to secure Austria's future, instead his 1817 proposals for administrative reform were largely rejected and his opposition to [[German nationalism]] is blamed for [[Unification of Germany|Germany's unification under Prussia]] and not Austria. Other historians have argued that he had far less power than this view suggests and that his policies were only exercised when they were in accord with the views of the Emperor.

==Early life==
[[File:Fürst metternich.jpg|thumb|Metternich's coat of arms|250px]]
Klemens Metternich was born into the [[House of Metternich]] on 15 May 1773 to Franz George Karl Count Metternich-[[County of Beilstein|Winneburg zu Beilstein]], a diplomat who had passed from the service of the [[Archbishopric of Trier]] to that of the Imperial court, and his wife Countess Maria Beatrice Aloisia von Kageneck.&lt;ref name="cecil72"&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|pp=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named in honour of [[Prince Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony]], the archbishop-elector of Trier and the past employer of his father.&lt;ref name="palmer5"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest son and had one older sister. At the time of his birth the family possessed a ruined keep at Beilstein, a castle at Winneberg, an estate west of [[Koblenz]], and another in [[Königswart]], [[Bohemia]], won during the 17th century.&lt;ref name="palmer5"/&gt; At this time Metternich's father, described as "a boring babbler and chronic liar" by a contemporary, was the Austrian ambassador to the courts of the three Rhenish electors (Trier, Cologne and Mainz).&lt;ref name="palmer5"/&gt; Metternich's education was handled by his mother, heavily influenced by their proximity to France; Metternich spoke French better than German.  As a child he went on official visits with his father and, under the direction of Protestant tutor John Frederick Simon, was tutored in academic subjects, swimming, and horsemanship.&lt;ref name="palmer10"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadeau|first=Ryan|date=2016|title=Creating a Statesman: The Early Life of Prince Clemens von Metternich and its Effect on his Political Philosophy|url=http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1148&amp;context=ghj|journal=The Gettysburg Historical Journal|volume=15|issue=1|pages=|issn=2327-3917|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1788 Metternich began studying law at the [[University of Strasbourg]], matriculating on 12 November. While a student he was for some time accommodated by [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Prince Maximilian of Zweibrücken]], the future King of Bavaria.&lt;ref name="palmer10"/&gt; At this time he was described by Simon as "happy, handsome and lovable", though contemporaries would later recount how he had been a liar and a braggart.&lt;ref name="palmer12"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich left Strasbourg in September 1790 to attend [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]]'s October coronation in [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]], where he performed the largely honorific role of Ceremonial Marshall to the [[Bench of Counts of Westphalia|Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia]]. There, under the wing of his father, he met with the future [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] and looked at ease among the attendant nobility.&lt;ref name="palmer12"/&gt;

Between the end of 1790 and summer of 1792 Metternich studied law at the [[University of Mainz]],&lt;ref name="sauvignyxiii"&gt;{{harvnb|Bertier de Sauvigny|1962|pp=xiii–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving a more conservative education than at Strasbourg, a city the return to which was now unsafe. In the summers he worked with his father, who had been appointed [[plenipotentiary]] and effective ruler of the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. In March 1792 Francis succeeded as Holy Roman Emperor and was crowned in July, affording Metternich a reprisal of his earlier role of Ceremonial Marshall.  In the meantime France had declared war on Austria, beginning the [[War of the First Coalition]] (1792–7) and making Metternich's further study in Mainz impossible.&lt;ref name="palmer16"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=16–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the employment of his father,&lt;ref name="sauvignyxiii"/&gt; he was sent on a special mission to the front. Here he led the interrogation of the French Minister of War [[Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville|the Marquis de Beurnonville]] and several accompanying [[National Convention]] commissioners. Metternich observed the [[Siege of Valenciennes (1793)|siege and fall of Valenciennes]], later looking back on these as substantial lessons about warfare. In early 1794 he was sent to England, ostensibly on official business helping [[Viscount Desandrouin]], by the Treasurer-General of the Austrian Netherlands, to negotiate a loan.&lt;ref name="palmer22"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and the Congress of Rastatt==
In England he met the King on several occasions and dined with a number of influential British politicians, including [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], [[Charles James Fox]] and [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich was nominated the new [[Minister Plenipotentiary]] to the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and left England in September 1794. On arrival, he found an exiled and powerless government in headlong retreat from the latest French advance.&lt;ref name="palmer22"/&gt; In October a revitalised French army swept into Germany and annexed all of the Metternich estates except Königswart. Disappointed, and affected by strong criticism of his father's policies, he joined his parents in Vienna in November.&lt;ref name="palmer25"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 1795 he married Countess Eleonore von Kaunitz, a granddaughter of former Austrian chancellor [[Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz|Wenzel Kaunitz]].&lt;ref name="cecil78"&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was arranged by Metternich's mother and introduced him to Viennese society. This was undoubtedly part of the motivation for Metternich, who demonstrated less affection for her than she for him. Two conditions were imposed by the father of the bride, Prince Kaunitz: first, the still youthful Eleonore was to continue to live at home; and second, Metternich was forbidden from serving as a diplomat as long as the Prince was still alive.&lt;ref name="palmer25"/&gt; Their daughter Maria was born in January 1797.&lt;ref name="palmer27"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=27–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Metternich's studies in Vienna, the Prince's death in September 1797 allowed Metternich to participate in the [[Second Congress of Rastatt|Congress of Rastatt]].&lt;ref name="palmer31"/&gt; Initially [[:File:Franz Georg Karl von Metternich-Winneburg-Beilstein c 1799.png|his father, who headed the imperial delegation]], took him as a secretary while ensuring that, when proceedings officially started in December 1797, he was named the representative of the Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia.&lt;ref name="cecil78"/&gt; A bored Metternich remained at Rastatt in this role until 1799 when the congress was finally wound down.&lt;ref name="palmer27"/&gt; During this period Eleonore had chosen to live with Metternich at Rastatt and gave birth to sons Francis (February 1798) and, shortly after the end of the Congress, Klemens (June 1799). Much to Metternich's anguish Klemens died after only a few days, and Francis soon contracted a lung infection from which he would never recover.&lt;ref name="palmer31"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=31–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambassador==

===Dresden and Berlin===
The Holy Roman Empire's defeat in the [[War of the Second Coalition]] shook up diplomatic circles, and the promising Metternich was now offered a choice between three ministerial positions: to the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] at [[Regensburg]]; to the [[Denmark-Norway|Kingdom of Denmark]] at [[Copenhagen]]; or to the [[Elector of Saxony]] at [[Dresden]]. He chose Dresden in late January 1801, and his appointment was officially announced in February. Metternich summered in Vienna, where he wrote his "Instructions", a memorandum showing much greater understanding of statesmanship than his earlier writing. He visited the Königswart estate in the autumn before taking up his new position on 4 November.&lt;ref name="palmer31"/&gt; The subtleties of the memorandum were lost on the Saxon court, which was headed by the retiring [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus]], a man with little political initiative.  Despite the boredom of the court, Metternich enjoyed the light-hearted frivolity of the city and took up a mistress, [[Catherine Bagration|Katharina Bagration]], who bore him a daughter, Klementine.  In January 1803 Metternich and his wife had a child whom they named Viktor.&lt;ref name="palmer31"/&gt; In Dresden Metternich also made a number of important contacts including [[Friedrich Gentz]],&lt;ref name="cecil85"/&gt; a publicist who would serve Metternich as both confidant and critic for the next thirty years. He also established links with important Polish and French political figures.&lt;ref name="palmer37"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|Count Metternich is young but by no means maladroit. We shall see how he shapes up in Berlin.|[[Franz de Paula Karl von Colloredo|Colloredo]] to [[Johann Amadeus Francis de Paula, Baron of Thugut|Thugut]] {{harv|Palmer|1972|p=39}}.}}

To compensate for the loss of the Metternich's ancestral estates in the Moselle valley when the French Republic annexed the west bank of the Rhine, the [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss|Imperial Recess]] of 1803 brought Metternich's family new estates in [[Ochsenhausen]], the title of Prince, and a seat in the Imperial Diet. In the ensuing diplomatic reshuffle Metternich was appointed ambassador to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], being notified of this in February 1803 and taking his position in November of that year.&lt;ref name="palmer37"/&gt; He arrived at a critical juncture in European diplomacy,&lt;ref name="cecil85"&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|pp=85–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  soon growing worried about the territorial ambitions of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], newly the leader of France. This fear was shared by the Russian court under [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], and the Tsar kept Metternich informed of Russian policy. By autumn of 1804 Vienna decided on action entered into in August 1805 when the Austrian Empire (as the Holy Roman Empire was in the process of becoming&lt;ref name="cecil85"/&gt;) began its involvement in the [[War of the Third Coalition]]. Metternich's now almost impossible task was to convince Prussia to join the coalition against Bonaparte. Their eventual agreement was not due to Metternich, however, and after the coalition's defeat at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], Prussia disregarded the agreement and signed a [[Treaty of Schönbrunn (1805)|treaty with the French]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris===
In the ensuing reshuffle in Vienna [[Johann Philipp Stadion, Count von Warthausen|Johann Philipp Stadion]] became the Austrian foreign minister, freeing Metternich to assume the post of Ambassador to the Russian Empire. He never made it to Russia, as need had arisen for a new Austrian at the French court. Metternich was approved for the post in June 1806.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;There is some confusion over why Metternich was selected. Napoleon said he wanted "a Kaunitz", and whether he literally meant someone from the [[Kaunitz family|house of Kaunitz]] or merely someone in the style of [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|the Prince of Kaunitz]], who had been ambassador to France 1750–3, this worked in favour of Metternich, the husband of a Kaunitz {{harv|Palmer|1972|pp=44–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed being in demand and was happy to be sent to France on a generous salary of 90,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]] a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=44–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an arduous trip he took up residence in August 1806, being briefed by [[Baron von Vincent]] and [[Engelbert von Floret]], whom he would retain as a close adviser for two decades. He met French foreign minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Charles Talleyrand]] on 5 August and Napoleon himself five days later at [[Château de Saint-Cloud|Saint-Cloud]]; soon, the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]] drew both Talleyrand and Napoleon eastwards.&lt;ref name="palmer47"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=47–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich's wife and children joined him in October, and he went into society, using his charm to win great eminence there. The presence of Eleonore did not prevent him from a series of affairs that certainly included Napoleon's sister [[Caroline Bonaparte|Caroline Murat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laure Junot, duchess d'Abrantès|Laure Junot]], and perhaps many besides.&lt;ref name="palmer47"/&gt;

After the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] of July 1807 Metternich saw that Austria's position in Europe was much more vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, [[Jean-Baptiste Champagny]] unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement over the future of several French forts on the [[Inn (river)|River Inn]]. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased.&lt;ref name="palmer56"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=56–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.&lt;ref name="palmer56"/&gt;

[[File:Entrevue Erfurt by Nicolas Grosse.jpg|thumb|right|Napoleon receiving von Vincent at Erfurt, a congress Metternich was not allowed to attend]]
In a memorable event, Metternich argued with Napoleon at Napoleon's 39th birthday celebrations in August 1808 over the increasingly obvious preparations for war on both sides.&lt;ref name="cecil98"&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|pp=98–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Napoleon refused Metternich's attendance at the [[Congress of Erfurt]]; Metternich was later glad to hear from Talleyrand that Napoleon's attempts at the Congress to get Russia to invade Austria had proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="palmer61"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=61–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1808 Metternich was recalled to Vienna for five weeks of meetings about the possibility of Austria invading France while Napoleon was [[Peninsular War|on campaign in Spain]].&lt;ref name="palmer61"/&gt; His memoranda reported that France was not united behind Napoleon, that Russia was unlikely to want to fight Austria, and that France had few reliable troops that could fight in central Europe.&lt;ref name="cecil98"/&gt; Back in Paris, Metternich was overtly apprehensive about his own safety. When [[War of the Fifth Coalition|Austria declared war on France]], Metternich was indeed arrested in retaliation for the arrest of two French diplomats in Vienna, but the effects of this were minimal. He was allowed to leave France under escort for Austria in late May 1809. After Napoleon's capture of Vienna Metternich was conducted to the Austrian capital and exchange there for the French diplomats.&lt;ref name="palmer61"/&gt;

==Foreign Minister==

===Détente with France===
Now back in Austria, Metternich witnessed first hand the Austrian army's defeat at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in 1809. Stadion tendered his resignation as Foreign Minister in the aftermath, and the Emperor immediately offered the post to Metternich. Metternich, worried that Napoleon would seize on this to demand harsher peace terms, instead agreed to become a minister of state (which he did on 8 July) and to lead negotiations with the French on the understanding that he would replace Stadion as Foreign Minister at a later date.&lt;ref name="palmer69"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=69–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; During peace talks at Altenburg, Metternich put forward pro-French proposals to save the Austrian monarchy. Napoleon, however, disliked his position on the future of Poland, and Metternich was gradually displaced from the proceedings by [[Prince Liechtenstein]]. He soon regained influence, however, on 8 October, as Foreign Minister (and additionally that of [[Emperor of Austria#The Imperial House|Minister of the Imperial Household]]).&lt;ref name="palmer69"/&gt; In early 1810 Metternich's earlier affair with Junot became public but, because of Eleonore's understanding, the scandal was minimal.&lt;ref name="palmer72"/&gt;

[[File:Napoleon Marie Louise Marriage1.jpeg|thumb|Metternich was influential in bringing about the marriage of Napoleon to Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria. Painting by [[Georges Rouget]].]]

One of Metternich's first tasks was to push for the marriage of Napoleon to [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Archduchess Marie Louise]] rather than to the Tsar's youngest sister [[Anna Pavlovna of Russia|Anna Pavlovna]]. Metternich would later seek to distance himself from the marriage by claiming it was Napoleon's own idea, but this is improbable; in any case, he was happy to claim responsibility at the time.&lt;ref name="palmer72"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=72–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 7 February Napoleon had agreed and the pair were married by proxy on 11 March. Marie Louise left for France soon after and Metternich followed by a different route and unofficially. The trip was designed, Metternich explained, to transport his family (stranded in France by the outbreak of war) home and to report to the Austrian Emperor about Marie Louise's activities.&lt;ref name="palmer72"/&gt;

Instead, Metternich stayed six months, entrusting his office in Vienna to his father. He set about using the marriage, and flattery, to renegotiate the terms set out at Schönbrunn. The concessions he won were trivial, however: a few trading rights, delay in the payment of the war indemnity, restitution of some estates belonging to Germans in the Austrian service, including the Metternich family's, and the lifting of a 150,000 man limit on the Austrian army. The last was particularly welcomed as a sign of increased Austrian independence, although Austria could no longer afford an army greater than the limit prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Palmer|1972|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As France's ally====
When Metternich returned to Vienna in October 1810, he was no longer as popular. His influence was limited to foreign affairs, and his attempts to get a full [[Council of State]] reintroduced had failed.&lt;ref name="palmer72"/&gt; Convinced that a much weakened Austria should avoid another invasion by France, he rejected the advances of Tsar Alexander and instead concluded an alliance with Napoleon on 14 March 1812. He also supported a period of moderate censorship, aimed at preventing provocation of the French.&lt;ref name="palmer78"/&gt; Requiring that only 30,000 Austrian troops fight alongside the French,{{sfn|Cecil|1947|p=125}} the alliance treaty was more generous than the one Prussia had signed a month earlier; this allowed Metternich to give both Britain and Russia assurances that Austria remained committed to curbing Napoleonic ambitions. He accompanied his sovereign for a final meeting with Napoleon at Dresden in May 1812 before Napoleon embarked upon the [[French invasion of Russia]].&lt;ref name="palmer78"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=78–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dresden meeting revealed that Austria's influence in Europe had reached its lowest point, and Metternich was now bent on re-establishing that influence by using what he considered strong ties with all sides in the war, proposing general peace talks headed by Austria. Over the next three months, he would slowly distance Austria from the French cause, while avoiding alliance with either Prussia or Russia,&lt;ref name="palmer86"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remaining open to any proposal that would secure a place for the combined Bonaparte-Habsburg dynasty.&lt;ref name="palmer86"/&gt; This was driven by concern that if Napoleon were defeated, Russia and Prussia would stand to gain too much.&lt;ref name="ford221"&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|1971|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon was intransigent, however, and the fighting (now officially the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]]) continued. Austria's alliance with France ended in February 1813, and Austria then moved to a position of armed neutrality.&lt;ref name="palmer86"/&gt;

====As a neutral====
Metternich was much less keen on turning against France than many of his contemporaries (though not the Emperor), and he favoured his own plans for a general settlement. In November 1813 he offered Napoleon the [[Frankfurt proposals]], which would allow Napoleon to remain Emperor but would reduce France to its "natural frontiers" and undo its control of most of Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands.  Napoleon, expecting to win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had withdrawn the offer.  By early 1814, as they were closing in on Paris, Napoleon agreed to the Frankfurt proposals, too late, and he rejected the new, harsher terms then proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. P. Riley|first=|title=Napoleon and the World War of 1813: Lessons in Coalition Warfighting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beq3AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen T. Ross, ''European Diplomatic History 1789–1815: France against Europe'' (1969) pp 341–44&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Allies were not faring well, and although a statement of general war aims that included many nods to Austria was secured from Russia, Britain remained distrustful and generally unwilling to give up the military initiative she had fought 20 years to establish. Despite this, Francis created the Austrian Foreign Minister [[Grand-Chancellor of the Order of Maria Theresa]], a post which had been vacant since the time of Kaunitz.&lt;ref name="palmer92"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=92–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich increasingly worried that Napoleon's retreat would bring with it disorder that would harm the Habsburgs.&lt;ref name="ford221"/&gt;&lt;ref name="palmer92"/&gt; A peace had to be concluded soon, he believed. Since Britain could not be coerced, he sent proposals to France and Russia only. These were rejected, though after the battles of [[Battle of Lützen (1813)|Lützen]] (2 May) and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]] (20–21 May), a French-initiated truce was called. Starting in April Metternich began to "slowly and reluctantly" prepare Austria for war with France; the armistice provided Austria time for fuller complete mobilisation.&lt;ref name="palmer92"/&gt;

In June Metternich left Vienna to personally handle negotiations at [[Gitschin]] in Bohemia. When he arrived he benefitted from the hospitality of [[Princess Wilhelmine, Duchess of Sagan]] and began an affair with her that lasted several months. No other mistress ever achieved such influence over Metternich as Wilhelmine, and he would continue to write to her after their separation. Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister [[Hugues-Bernard Maret, duc de Bassano|Hugues-Bernard Maret]] remained elusive, though Metternich did manage to discuss the state of affairs with the Tsar on 18–19 June at [[Opotschna]].&lt;ref name="palmer96"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=96–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In talks which would later be ratified as the [[Treaties of Reichenbach (1813)|Reichenbach Convention]] they agreed on general peace demands&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;, namely that [[Lübeck]] and [[Hamburg]] would return to being free cities, and more generally the end of direct French control over the [[Rhenish Confederation]]; the return of annexed Prussian territory; the return of the Illyrian provinces to Austria; and the dissolution of the French-dominated [[Grand Duchy of Warsaw]] {{harv|Palmer|1972|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and set out a process by which Austria could enter the war on the Coalition side. Shortly afterwards Metternich was invited to join Napoleon at Dresden, where he could put the terms directly. Though no reliable record of their meeting on 26 June 1813 exists, it seems it was a stormy but effective meeting. Agreement was finally reached as Metternich was about to leave:&lt;ref name="palmer96"/&gt; peace talks would start in Prague in July and run until 20 August.&lt;ref name="cecil134"&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agreeing to this Metternich had ignored the Reichenbach Convention, and this angered Austria's Coalition allies.&lt;ref name="palmer96"/&gt; The Conference of Prague would never properly meet, since Napoleon gave his representatives [[Armand Caulaincourt]] and the [[Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara|Count of Narbonne]] insufficient powers to negotiate.&lt;ref name="cecil134"/&gt; At the informal discussions held in lieu of the conference, Caulaincourt implied that Napoleon would not negotiate until an allied army threatened France itself. This convinced Metternich, and, after an ultimatum Metternich issued to France went unheeded, Austria declared war on 12 August.&lt;ref name="palmer96"/&gt;

====As a coalition partner====
[[File:1839 Krafft Siegesmeldung nach der Schlacht bei Leipzig 1813 anagoria.JPG|thumb|Prince of Schwarzenberg and three allied monarchs after the [[battle of Leipzig]], 1813. Painting by [[Johann Peter Krafft]].]]
Austria's allies saw the declaration as an admission that Austria's diplomatic ambitions had failed, but Metternich viewed it as one move in a much longer campaign.&lt;ref name="palmer103"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=103–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of the war he strove to hold the Coalition together and, as such, to curb Russian momentum in Europe. To this end he won an early victory as an Austrian general, the [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Prince of Schwarzenberg]], was confirmed supreme commander of the Coalition forces rather than [[Tsar Alexander I]]. He also succeeded in getting the three allied monarchs (Alexander, Francis and Prussia's [[Frederick William III]]) to follow him and their armies on campaign. With the [[Treaties of Teplitz]], Metternich allowed Austria to remain uncommitted over the future of France, Italy, and Poland. He was still confined, however, by the British, who were subsidizing Prussia and Russia (in September Metternich requested subsidies for Austria as well).&lt;ref name="palmer103"/&gt; Meanwhile, the Coalition forces took the offensive.&lt;ref name="palmer103"/&gt; On 18 October 1813 Metternich witnessed the successful [[Battle of Leipzig]] and, two days later, he was rewarded for his "wise direction" with the rank of prince ({{lang-de|[[Fürst]]|links=no}}).&lt;ref name="sauvignyxiii"/&gt; Metternich was delighted when Frankfurt was retaken in early November and, in particular, by the deference the Tsar showed Francis at a ceremony organised there by Metternich. Diplomatically, with the war drawing to a close, he remained determined to prevent the creation of a strong, unified German state, even offering Napoleon generous terms in order to retain him as a counterweight. On 2 December 1813 Napoleon agreed to talk, though these talks were delayed by the need for the participation of a more senior British diplomat, ([[Robert Stewart, 2nd Marquess of Londonderry|Viscount Castlereagh]]).&lt;ref name="palmer103"/&gt;

Before talks could begin, Coalition armies crossed the Rhine on 22 December. Metternich retired from Frankfurt to [[Breisgau]] to celebrate Christmas with his wife's family before travelling to the new Coalition headquarters at [[Basel]] in January 1814. Quarrels with Tsar Alexander, particularly over the fate of France&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;At this time, the Russians favoured a new monarchy under [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Jean Bernadotte]], while Austria favoured keeping the Bonaparte-Habsburg dynasty, if not under Napoleon himself {{harv|Palmer|1972|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; intensified in January, prompting Alexander to storm out. He therefore missed the arrival of Castlereagh in mid-January.&lt;ref name="palmer107"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=107–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich and Castlereagh formed a good working relationship and then met with Alexander at [[Langres]]. The Tsar remained unaccommodating however, demanding a push into the centre of France; but he was too preoccupied to object to Metternich's other ideas, like a final peace conference in Vienna. Metternich did not attend talks with the French at Chatillon, as he wanted to stay with Alexander. The talks stalled, and, after a brief advance, Coalition forces had to retreat after the [[Battle of Montmirail|Montmirail]] and [[Battle of Montereau|Montereau]]. This relieved Metternich's fears that an overconfident Alexander might act unilaterally.&lt;ref name="palmer107"/&gt;

{{rquote|right|You have no idea what sufferings the people at headquarters impose upon us! I cannot stand it much longer and the Emperor Francis is already ill. [The other leaders] are all mad and belong in the lunatic asylum.|Metternich to Stadion {{harv|Palmer|1972|p=116}}}}
Metternich continued negotiations with the French envoy Caulaincourt through early to mid March 1814, when victory at the [[Battle of Laon|Laon]] put the Coalition back on the offensive. By this time Metternich was tiring of trying to hold the Coalition together, and even the British-engineered [[Treaty of Chaumont]] did not help.&lt;ref name="palmer107"/&gt; In the absence of the Prussians and Russians the Coalition agreed to the restoration of the [[Bourbon dynasty]].&lt;ref name="palmer107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ford257"/&gt; Francis rejected a final plea from Napoleon that he abdicate in favour of his wife, and Paris fell on 30 March. Military manoeuvres had forced Metternich westward to Dijon on 24 March and now, after deliberate delay, he left for the French capital on 7 April.&lt;ref name="palmer107"/&gt; On 10 April he found a city at peace and, much to his annoyance, largely in the control of Tsar Alexander. The Austrians disliked the terms of the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] that Russia had imposed on Napoleon in their absence, but Metternich was reluctant to oppose them and on 11 April signed the treaty. Thereafter he focused on safeguarding Austrian interests in the forthcoming peace; asserting Austria's influence in Germany over that of Prussia; and undoing Russian ascendancy. For these reasons he ensured that the Italian provinces of Lombardy and Venetia, [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|lost to French client states in 1805]], were duly re-annexed.&lt;ref name="palmer118"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=118–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the division of formerly French-occupied Poland and Germany, Metternich was more confined by the interests of the Allies. After two failed proposals, advanced by the Prussians, the issue was postponed until after a peace treaty had been signed.&lt;ref name="palmer123"/&gt; Elsewhere, Metternich, like many of his counterparts, was anxious to provide the renewed French monarchy with the resources to suppress new revolution. The generous [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on 30 May.&lt;ref name="ford257"&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|1971|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now free, Metternich accompanied Tsar Alexander to England; Wilhelmine, who had followed Metternich to Paris, also made the crossing.&lt;ref name="palmer123"/&gt; A triumphant Metternich filled his four weeks with revelry, re-establishing his reputation and that of Austria; he was also awarded an honorary law degree from the [[University of Oxford]]. By contrast and to Metternich's pleasure, Alexander was ill-mannered and often insulting. Despite the opportunities, little diplomacy took place; instead, all that was firmly agreed was that proper discussions would take place at Vienna, with a date tentatively set for 15 August. When the Tsar tried to postpone it to October Metternich agreed but effected conditions that prevented Alexander from exercising any advantage due to his de facto control of Poland. Metternich was eventually reunited with his family in Austria in the middle of July 1814, having stopped for a week in France to soothe fears surrounding Napoleon's wife Marie Louise, now the Duchess of Parma. His return to Vienna was celebrated by an occasional cantata that included the line "History holds thee up to posterity as a model among great men".&lt;ref name="palmer123"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=123–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress of Vienna===
{{Further|Congress of Vienna}}
[[File:Vienna Congress.jpg|thumb|250px|Metternich alongside [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]], [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] and other European diplomats at the Congress of Vienna, 1815]]
In the autumn of 1814 the heads of the five reigning dynasties and representatives from 216 noble families began gathering in Vienna. Before ministers from the "Big Four" (the Coalition allies of Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia) arrived, Metternich stayed quietly in [[Baden bei Wien]], two hours to the south. When he heard they had reached Vienna he journeyed to meet them and encouraged them to go with him back to Baden. They declined, and four meetings were held in the city itself.&lt;ref name="palmer130"/&gt; In these, the representatives agreed on how the Congress would operate and, to Metternich's delight, named his own aide Friedrich Gentz secretary to the negotiations of the "Big Six" (the Big Four plus France and Spain). When [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] and Spanish representative [[Pedro Gómez Labrador, Marquis of Labrador|Don Pedro Labrador]] learned of these decisions, they were incensed that agreements were negotiated by the Big Four only. Sweden and Portugal were similarly angered by their exclusion from all but the full Congress, especially since Metternich was determined to give the latter as little power as possible. As a result, the Big Six became the [[Preliminary Committee of the Eight]], whose first decision was that the congress itself be postponed to 1 November.&lt;ref name="palmer130"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it would soon be postponed again, with only a minor commission beginning work in November.&lt;ref name="palmer133"/&gt; In the meantime, Metternich organised a controversially vast array of entertainments for the delegates including himself.&lt;ref name="palmer130"/&gt;

Leaving [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]] to negotiate on Tsar Alexander's behalf, Metternich briefly turned his attention to quelling anti-Habsburg feeling in Italy. Around the same time,  he learnt that the Duchess of Sagan was courting the Tsar. Disappointed, and exhausted by social rounds, Metternich let his guard drop, angering Tsar Alexander during negotiations over Poland (then ruled by Napoleon as the [[Grand Duchy of Warsaw]]) by implying Austria could match Russia militarily. The pair would never meet in person again.&lt;ref name="palmer133"/&gt; Despite the blunder, Francis refused to dismiss his foreign minister, and political crisis rocked Vienna throughout November, culminating in a declaration by Tsar Alexander that Russia would not compromise in its claim on Poland as a satellite kingdom. The Coalition rejected this utterly, and agreement seemed further off than ever.&lt;ref name="palmer133"/&gt; During the stand-off, it seems that Alexander even went as far as to challenge Metternich to a duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton-Williams|1996|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tsar Alexander soon did a rapid ''volte face'' and agreed to the division of Poland. He also softened in regard to the Germanic [[Kingdom of Saxony]], and for the first time allowed Talleyrand to participate in all Big Four (now Big Five) discussions.&lt;ref name="palmer133"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=133–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the new consensus, the major issues concerning Poland and Germany were settled in the second week of February 1815.&lt;ref name="palmer139"/&gt; Austria gained land in the partition of Poland and prevented the Prussian annexation of Saxony, but was forced to accept Russian dominance in Poland and increasing Prussian influence in Germany.&lt;ref name="okey73"&gt;{{harvnb|Okey|2001|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich now focused on getting the various German states to cede historic rights to a new [[Bundesversammlung (German Confederation)|Federal Diet]] that could stand up to Prussia. He also assisted the Swiss Committee and worked on a myriad of smaller issues, like navigation rights on the [[Rhine]]. The beginning of [[Lent]] on 8 February brought him more time to devote to these congressional issues as well as private discussions about southern Italy, where [[Joachim Murat]] was said to be raising a Neapolitan army.&lt;ref name="palmer139"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=139–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 March Metternich was awakened with the news that Napoleon had escaped from his island prison of [[Elba]]&lt;ref name="cecil169"&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|pp=169–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within an hour had met with both the Tsar and the King of Prussia. Metternich wanted no rash change of course, and at first there was little impact on the Congress. Finally, on 13 March the Big Five declared Napoleon an [[outlaw]] and the Allies began preparations for renewed fighting. On 25 March they signed a treaty committing each to sending 150,000 men with little sign of their prior divisive stances. After the military commanders left, the Vienna Congress settled down to serious work, fixing the boundaries of an independent Netherlands, formalising proposals for a loose confederation of [[Swiss canton]]s, and ratifying earlier agreements over Poland. By late April only two major issues remained, the organisation of a new German federation and the problem of Italy.&lt;ref name="palmer139"/&gt;

{{rquote|right|The ministers and representatives of the German princes sent to the congress continue to sing the praises of Prince Metternich.... They admire the tact and circumspection with which he has handled the German committee.|From the report of an agent of the Austrian intelligence service {{harv|Palmer|1972|pp=147–148}}.}}

The latter soon began to come to a head. Austria had solidified its control over Lombardy-Venice and extended its protection to provinces nominally under the control of Francis' daughter Marie Louise. On 18 April Metternich announced that Austria was formally at [[Neapolitan War|war with Murat's Naples]]. Austria won the [[Battle of Tolentino]] on 3 May and captured Naples less than three weeks later. Metternich then was able to delay a decision on the future of the country until after Vienna. Discussions about Germany would drag on until early June, when a joint Austrian-Prussian proposition was ratified. It left most constitutional issues to the new diet; its President would be the Emperor Francis himself.&lt;ref name="palmer146"/&gt; Despite criticism from within Austria, Metternich was pleased with the outcome and the degree of control it granted Habsburgs, and, through them, himself.&lt;ref name="palmer146"/&gt; Certainly, Metternich was able to use the diet to his own ends on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|1971|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement was similarly popular with most German representatives. A summation treaty was signed on 19 June (the Russians signed a week later&lt;ref name="cecil169"/&gt;), bringing the Vienna Congress officially to an end. Metternich himself had left on 13 June for the front line, prepared for a lengthy war against Napoleon. Napoleon, however, was defeated decisively at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on 18 June.&lt;ref name="palmer146"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=146–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris and Italy===
Metternich was soon back with coalition allies in Paris, once more discussing peace terms. After 133 days of negotiations, longer than the [[Hundred Days|turmoil itself]], the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|second Treaty of Paris]] was concluded on 20 November. Metternich, of the opinion that France should not be dismembered, was happy with the result:&lt;ref name="palmer150"/&gt; France lost only a little land along its eastern borders, seven hundred million [[French franc]]s, and the artworks it had plundered. It also accepted an army of occupation numbering 150,000.&lt;ref name="cecil169"/&gt; In the meantime a separate treaty, proposed by Alexander and redrafted by Metternich, had been signed on 26 September. This created a new [[Holy Alliance]] centered on Russia, Prussia and Austria; it was a document Metternich neither pushed for nor wanted, given its vaguely liberal sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bertier de Sauvigny|1962|pp=129–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from most of the European states eventually signed, with the exception of the Pope, the United Kingdom, and the Ottoman Empire. Shortly afterwards, a separate treaty reaffirmed the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|Quadruple Alliance]] and established through its sixth article the [[Congress System]] of regular diplomatic meetings. With Europe at peace, the Austrian flag now flew over 50% more land than when Metternich had become Foreign Minister.&lt;ref name="palmer150"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=150–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metternich now returned to the question of Italy, making his first visit to the country in early December 1815. After visiting Venice, his family joined him in Milan on 18 December. For once it was Metternich playing the liberal, vainly urging Francis to give the region some autonomy. Metternich spent four months in Italy, endlessly busy and suffering chronic inflammation of the eyelids. He tried to control Austrian foreign policy from Milan and, when there was a serious disagreement between the Empire and the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], was heavily criticised for his absence. His enemies could not capitalise on this, however; Stadion was occupied by his work as finance minister and the Empress [[Maria Ludovika of Austria-Este|Maria Ludovika]], a fierce critic of Metternich's policies, died in April.&lt;ref name="palmer156"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=156–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uncharacteristic gap between the views of Metternich and his emperor was eased only by active compromise of proposals. Metternich returned to Vienna on 28 May 1816 after almost a year's absence. Professionally, the rest of 1816 passed quietly for the tired Minister, who was concerned with fiscal policy and monitoring the spread of liberalism in Germany and nationalism in Italy. Personally, he was shaken in November by the death of [[Julie Zichy-Festetics]]. Two years later he wrote that his "life ended there," and his old frivolity took some time to return. The only consolation was July's news that Metternich was to receive new estates along the Rhine at [[Johannisberg (Geisenheim)|Johannisberg]], only {{convert|25|mi|km}} from his birthplace at Koblenz.&lt;ref name="palmer156"/&gt;

In June 1817 Metternich was required to escort the emperor's newly wed daughter [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Maria Leopoldina]] to a ship at [[Livorno]]. There was delay upon their arrival, and Metternich spent the time travelling around Italy again; he visited Venice, Padua, Ferrara, Pisa, Florence and [[Lucca]]. Though alarmed by developments (he noted that many of Francis' concessions were still not in practice), he was optimistic and made another plea for decentralisation on 29 August.&lt;ref name="palmer161"/&gt; After this failed, Metternich decided to broaden his efforts into general administrative reform to avoid the appearance of favouring the Italians over the rest of the Empire. While working on this, he returned to Vienna on 12 September 1817 to be immediately caught up in the organisation of his daughter Maria's marriage to Count [[Joseph Esterházy]] just three days later. It proved too much, and Metternich was taken ill. After a delay for recovery,  Metternich condensed his proposals for Italy into three documents he submitted to Francis, all dated 27 October 1817. The administration would remain undemocratic, but there would be a new Ministry of Justice and four new chancellors—each with local remits, including one for "Italy".&lt;ref name="palmer161"/&gt; Importantly, the divisions would be regional, not national.&lt;ref name="okey73" /&gt; In the end, Francis accepted the revised proposals, albeit with several alterations and restrictions.&lt;ref name="palmer161"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=161–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Specifically, four chancellorships became three, one of which was never filled, and Italy did get a chancellery and permission to run its administration, education, and law in Italian; there was to be no new Ministry of Justice, though the [[Count of Wallis]] was made head of one new department responsible for legal reform and a new viceroy to Lombardy-Venetia was appointed (one of Francis' earlier concessions) {{harv|Palmer|1972|pp=161–168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aachen, Teplice, Karlsbad, Troppau and Laibach===
Metternich's primary focus remained on preserving unity among the Great Powers of Europe and hence his own power as mediator. He was also concerned by liberal-minded [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]]' increasing influence over Tsar Alexander and the continual threat of Russia annexing large areas of the declining [[Ottoman Empire]] (the so-called ''[[Eastern Question]]'').&lt;ref name="palmer169"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=169–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he had earlier envisaged, by April 1818 Britain had drawn up, and Metternich pushed through, proposals to have a [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Congress at Aachen]], then a Prussian frontier town, six months later. Meanwhile, Metternich was advised to go to the spa town of [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]] to treat the rheumatic tension in his back.&lt;ref name="palmer169"/&gt; It was a pleasant month-long trip, although it was there he received news of the death of his father at the age of 72.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; He visited the family estate at Königswart and then Frankfurt in late August to encourage the member states of the German Confederation to agree on procedural issues. He could also now visit Koblenz for the first time in 25 years and his new estate at Johannisberg. Travelling with Emperor Francis, he was warmly greeted by the Catholic towns along the Rhine as he progressed towards Aachen.&lt;ref name="palmer169"/&gt; He had arranged in advance for newspapers to cover the first peacetime congress of its kind. As discussions began, Metternich pushed for the withdrawal of allied troops from France and means for preserving the unity of the European powers. The former was agreed almost immediately; but on the latter agreement extended only to maintaining the Quadruple Alliance. Metternich rejected the Tsar's idealistic plans for (among other things) a single European army. His own recommendations to the Prussians for greater controls on [[freedom of speech]] was equally hard for other powers such as Britain to support openly.&lt;ref name="palmer169"/&gt;

{{rquote|right|Today the greatest evil—and therefore the most immediate—is the press.|Metternich to Gentz, June 1819 {{harv|Palmer|1972|p=182}}.}}
Metternich travelled with [[Dorothea Lieven]] to Brussels soon after the congress broke up, and although he could not stay more than a few days, the pair exchanged letters for the next eight years. He arrived in Vienna on 11 December 1818 and was finally able to spend considerable time with his children.&lt;ref name="palmer169"/&gt; He entertained the Tsar during the Christmas season and spent twelve weeks monitoring Italy and Germany before setting off with the Emperor on a third trip to Italy. The trip was cut short by the assassination of the conservative German dramatist [[August von Kotzebue]]. After a short delay, Metternich decided that if the German governments would not act against this perceived problem, Austria would have to compel them. He called an informal conference in Karlsbad&lt;ref name="palmer180"/&gt; and sounded out Prussian support beforehand by meeting with [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in [[Teplice]] in July.&lt;ref name="palmer180"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ford303"&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|1971|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich carried the day, using a recent attempt on the life of the Chief Minister of Nassau, [[Carl Friedrich Emil von Ibell|Carl Ibell]] to win agreement for the conservative program now known as the ''[[Convention of Teplitz]]''. The Karlsbad conference opened on 6 August and ran for the rest of the month.&lt;ref name="palmer180"/&gt; Metternich overcame any opposition to his proposed "group of anti-revolutionary measures, correct and preemptory", although they were condemned by outsiders.&lt;ref name="palmer180"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=180–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite censure Metternich was very pleased with the result,&lt;ref name="palmer180"/&gt; known as the "Karlsbad Decrees".&lt;ref name="okey73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ford303"/&gt;

At the [[Vienna Conference (1819)|conference in Vienna]] later in the year, Metternich found himself constrained by the Kings of Württemberg and Bavaria to abandon his plans to reform the German federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; He now regretted having so quickly forced through its original constitution five years before. Nevertheless, he held ground on other issues and the Conference's Final Act was highly reactionary, much as Metternich had envisaged it. He remained in Vienna until the close in May 1820, finding the whole affair a bore. On 6 May he heard of the death of his daughter Klementine from [[tuberculosis]]. Journeying on to Prague, he heard that his eldest daughter Maria had also contracted the disease. He was at her bedside in [[Baden bei Wien]] when she died on 20 July.&lt;ref name="palmer186"/&gt; This prompted Eleonore and the remaining children to leave for the cleaner air of France.&lt;ref name="cecil200"/&gt; The rest of 1820 was filled with liberal revolts to which Metternich was expected to respond. Ultimately, the Austrian Foreign Minister was torn between following through on his conservative pledge (a policy favoured by the Russians) and keeping out of a country in which Austria had no interest (favoured by the British). He chose "sympathetic inactivity" on Spain&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Metternich succeeded in preventing proposals for a French-led invasion only by rendering Tsar Alexander fearful of a French conspiracy {{harv|Palmer|1972|p=199}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but, much to his dismay and surprise, [[Guglielmo Pepe]] led a revolt in Naples in early July and forced King [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand I]] to accept a new constitution.&lt;ref name="palmer186"/&gt; Metternich reluctantly agreed to attend the Russian-initiated [[Congress of Troppau]] in October to discuss these events. He need not have worried: the Tsar gave way and accepted a compromise proposal of moderate interventionism.&lt;ref name="palmer186"/&gt; Still worried by Kapodistrias' influence over the Tsar, he laid down his conservative principles in a long memorandum, including an attack on the free press and the initiative of the middle classes.&lt;ref name="palmer186"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=186–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress disbanded in the third week of December, and the next step would be a [[Congress of Laibach|congress at Laibach]] to discuss intervention with Ferdinand.&lt;ref name="cecil200"&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|pp=200–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich found himself able to dominate Laibach more than any other congress, overseeing Ferdinand's rejection of the liberal constitution he had agreed to only months before. Austrian armies left for Naples in February and entered the city in March. The Congress was adjourned but, forewarned or by luck, Metternich kept representatives of the powers close at hand until the revolt was put down.&lt;ref name="palmer198"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=198–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when similar revolts broke out in [[Piedmont]] in the middle of March, Metternich had the Tsar at hand, who agreed to send 90,000 men to the frontier in a show of solidarity. Concerns grew in Vienna that Metternich's policy was too expensive. He responded that Naples and Piedmont would pay for stability; nonetheless, he, too, was clearly worried for the future of Italy. He was relieved when able to create a [[Court Chancellor]] and [[Chancellor of State]] on 25 May, a post left vacant since the death of Kaunitz in 1794. He was also pleased at the renewed (if fragile) closeness between Austria, Prussia and Russia;&lt;ref name="palmer198"/&gt; however, it had come at the expense of the Anglo-Austrian entente.&lt;ref name="cecil207"&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chancellor==

===Hanover, Verona and Czernowitz===
In 1821, while Metternich was still at Laibach with Tsar Alexander, the revolt of [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792–1828)|Alexander Ypsilantis]] threatened to bring the Ottoman Empire to the brink of collapse. Wanting a strong Ottoman Empire to counterbalance Russia,&lt;ref name="palmer203"/&gt; Metternich opposed all forms of Greek nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|1971|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Alexander returned to Russia, Metternich secured his agreement not to act unilaterally and would write to the Tsar again and again asking him not to intervene.&lt;ref name="palmer203"/&gt; For extra support he met with Viscount Castlereagh (now also [[Marquis of Londonderry]]) and King [[George IV of the United Kingdom]] in Hanover in October. The warmness of Metternich's welcome was sweetened by his promise to settle in part Austria's financial debts to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Palmer|1972|pp=203–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier Anglo-Austrian entente was thus restored,&lt;ref name="cecil207"/&gt; and the pair agreed that they would support the Austrian position concerning the Balkans. Metternich went away happy, not least because he had met Dorothea Lieven once more.&lt;ref name="palmer203"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=203–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Christmas the Tsar wavered more than Metternich had expected and sent [[Dmitri Tatischev]] to Vienna in February 1822 for talks with Metternich. Metternich soon convinced the "conceited and ambitious" Russian to let him dictate events.&lt;ref name="palmer203"/&gt; In return Austria promised to support Russia in enforcing its treaties with the Ottomans if the other alliance members would do likewise; Metternich was aware this was politically impossible for the British. Metternich's adversary at the Russian court, Kapodistrias, retired from service there; however, by the end of April there was a new threat: Russia now determined to intervene in Spain, action Metternich described as "utter nonsense".&lt;ref name="palmer203"/&gt; He played for time, convincing his ally Castlereagh to come to Vienna for talks before a scheduled congress in [[Verona]], although Castlereagh died by suicide on 12 August.&lt;ref name="palmer212"/&gt; With Castlereagh dead and relations with the British weakening, Metternich had lost a useful ally.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bertier de Sauvigny|1962|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congress of Verona]] was a fine social event but diplomatically less successful. Supposedly concerned with Italy, the Congress had to focus on Spain instead.&lt;ref name="palmer212"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=212–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria urged non-intervention, but it the French carried the day with their proposal for a joint invasion force.&lt;ref name="cecil211"&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|pp=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia committed men,&lt;ref name="cecil211"/&gt; and the Tsar pledged 150,000.&lt;ref name="palmer212"/&gt;  Metternich worried about the difficulties of transporting such numbers to Spain and about French ambitions, but still pledged (if only moral) support for the joint force.&lt;ref name="palmer212"/&gt;

He lingered in Verona until 18 December, then spending some days in Venice with the Tsar and then by himself in Munich. He returned to Vienna in early January 1823 and remained until September; after Verona he travelled much less than before, partly because of his new post as Chancellor and partly because of his declining health. He was buoyed by the arrival of his family from Paris in May. He shone once more in Viennese society.&lt;ref name="palmer218"/&gt; Politically, the year was one of disappointments. In March the French crossed the [[Pyrenees]] unilaterally, undoing the "moral solidarity" established at Verona. Likewise, Metternich thought the new [[Pope Leo XII]] too pro-French, and there was trouble between Austria and several German states over why they had not been included at Verona. Furthermore, Metternich, in discrediting the Russian diplomat [[Pozzo di Borgo]], instead renewed the Tsar's former suspicion of him. Worse came in late September: while accompanying the Emperor to a meeting with Alexander at [[Chernivtsi|Czernowitz]], an Austrian settlement now in the Ukraine, Metternich fell ill with a fever. He could not continue and had to make do with brief talks with the Russian Foreign Minister, [[Karl Nesselrode]]. At the Czernowitz talks, in Metternich's absence, an impatient Tsar asked for a congress in the then Russian capital [[Saint Petersburg]] to discuss the Eastern Question. Metternich, wary of letting the Russians dominate affairs, could only play for time.&lt;ref name="palmer218"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=218–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsar's dual proposal for the St Petersburg meetings, a settlement of the Eastern Question favourable to Russia and limited autonomy for three Greek principalities, was a pairing unpalatable to the other European powers, and potential attendees like British Foreign Secretary [[George Canning]] slowly turned away, much to the annoyance of Alexander. Metternich believed for several months afterward that he had gained a unique level of influence over the Tsar.&lt;ref name="palmer218"/&gt; Meanwhile, he renewed the conservative program he had outlined at Karlsbad five years before and sought to further increase Austrian influence over the German Federal Diet. He also informed the press they could no longer publicise the minutes of Diet meetings, only its rulings.&lt;ref name="palmer225"/&gt; In January 1825 he began to worry about his wife Eleonore's health and he reached her sickbed in Paris shortly before her death on 19 March. Mourning sincerely for her, he also took the opportunity to dine with the Paris elite. An aside he made about the Tsar there was reported back and did not enhance his reputation. He left Paris for the last time on 21 April and was joined by the Emperor in Milan after arriving on 7 May. He declined the Pope's invitation to become a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] of the church. There was also a short trip to [[Genoa]]. Early in July the court dispersed and Metternich visited his daughters Leontine (fourteen) and Hermine (nine) in the quiet town of [[Bad Ischl]]. Despite the seclusion he received constant reports, including those of ominous developments in the Ottoman Empire, where the Greek revolt was rapidly being crushed by [[Ibrahim Ali (Egypt)|Ibrahim Ali]] of Egypt. He also had to deal with fallout from St. Petersburg where the Tsar, although unable to convene a full congress, had talked with all the major ambassadors. By mid-May it was clear the allies could not decide on a course of action and, as such, the Holy Alliance was no longer a viable political entity.&lt;ref name="palmer227"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=227–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungarian Diets, Alexander I's death, and problems in Italy===
[[File:Graf Clemens Metternich.jpg|thumb|right|Metternich, c. 1830]]

In the early 1820s, Metternich had advised Francis that convening the [[Hungarian Diet]] would help get approval for financial reform. In fact, the Diet of 1825 to 1827 saw 300 sessions filled with criticism of how the Empire had eroded the historic rights of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]'s nobility. Metternich complained that it "interfered with [his] time, [his] customs and [his] daily life", as he was forced to travel to [[Pressburg]] (modern day Bratislava) to perform ceremonial duties and to observe.&lt;ref name="palmer232"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=232–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was alarmed by the growth of Hungarian national sentiment and wary of the growing influence of nationalist [[István Széchenyi]], whom he had met twice in 1825. Back in Vienna, in mid-December, he heard of the death of Tsar Alexander with mixed feelings. He had known the Tsar well and was reminded of his own frailty, although the death potentially wiped the soured diplomatic slate clean. Moreover, he could claim credit for foreseeing the [[Decembrist]] liberal revolt the new [[Tsar Nicholas I]] had to crush. Now 53, Metternich chose to send [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]] to establish first contact with Nicholas. Metternich was also friendly with the British envoy (the [[Duke of Wellington]]) and enlisted his help to charm Nicholas. Despite this, the first 18 months of Nicholas' reign did not go well for Metternich: firstly, the British were chosen over the Austrians to oversee Russian-Ottoman talks;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Britain and Austria both wished to avoid war, but the British Foreign Secretary Canning wanted an autonomous Greek state. This would be the topic of mediation with the Ottomans. Metternich, on the other hand, was resolutely opposed to courting instability by redrawing any borders in Eastern Europe{{harv|Palmer|1972|pp=236–237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a result, Metternich could exercise no influence over the resulting [[Akkerman Convention]]. France too began to drift away from Metternich's non-interventionist position. In August 1826 Russian Foreign Minister Nesselrode rejected a proposal by Metternich to convene a congress to discuss the events that eventually led to the [[Liberal Wars|outbreak of civil war]] in Portugal. The Austrian Foreign Minister accepted this with "surprising resilience".&lt;ref name="palmer232"/&gt;

On 5 November 1827 Baroness Antoinette von [[Leykam]] became Metternich's second wife. She was only twenty, and their marriage, a small affair at [[Hetzendorf]] (a village just outside Vienna), drew considerable criticism considering their difference in status . She belonged to the lower nobility, but Antoinette's grace and charm soon won over Viennese society.&lt;ref name="palmer232" /&gt; The same day British, Russian and French forces destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]]. Metternich worried that further intervention would topple the Ottoman Empire, upsetting the balance so carefully created in 1815. To his relief the new British Prime Minister Wellington and his cabinet were equally fearful of giving Russia the upper hand in the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; After another round of his proposals for congresses was rejected, Metternich stood back from the Eastern Question, watching as the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] was signed in September 1829. Though he publicly criticised it for being too harsh on Turkey, privately he was satisfied with its leniency and promise of Greek autonomy, making it a buffer against Russian expansion rather than a Russian satellite state. Metternich's private life was filled with grief. In November 1828 his mother died, and in January 1829 Antoinette died, five days after giving birth to their son, [[Richard von Metternich]]. After fighting [[tuberculosis]] for many months, Metternich's son Viktor, then a junior diplomat, died on 30 November 1829. Consequently, he spent Christmas alone and depressed, worried by the draconian methods of some of his fellow conservatives and by the renewed march of liberalism.&lt;ref name="palmer241"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=241–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|left|My whole life's work is destroyed.|Metternich on hearing of France's [[July Revolution]] {{harv|Palmer|1972|p=246}}.}}

In May Metternich took a much needed holiday on his estate at Johannisberg. He returned to Vienna a month later, still worried by the "chaos in London and Paris" and his declining ability to prevent it.&lt;ref name="palmer241"/&gt; Hearing Nesselrode was due to take the waters at Karlsbad, he met him there in late July. He berated the quiet Nesselrode, but no offence was taken. The two arranged a second meeting in August. In the interim Metternich heard of France's [[July Revolution]], which deeply shocked him and theoretically posed the need for a congress of the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|Quadruple Alliance]].&lt;ref name="palmer245"/&gt; Instead, Metternich met with Nesselrode as planned and, while the Russian rejected his plan to restore the old Alliance, the pair agreed on the [[Chiffon of Karlsbad]]: that panic was needless unless the new government showed territorial ambitions in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1947|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although pleased by this, Metternich's mood was soured by news of unrest in [[Brussels]] (then part of the Netherlands), the resignation of Wellington in London, and calls for constitutionality in Germany. He wrote with sombre and "almost morbid relish" that it was the "beginning of the end" of Old Europe. Nonetheless, he was heartened by the fact that the July Revolution had made a Franco-Russian alliance impossible and that the Netherlands had called an old-style congress of the sort he enjoyed so much. The 1830 convocation of the Hungarian Diet was also more successful than past ones, crowning Archduke Ferdinand as [[King of Hungary]] with little dissent. Moreover, by November his betrothal to 25-year-old Melanie [[Zichy family|Zichy-Ferraris]], who came from a Magyar family the Metternichs had long known, was agreed upon. The announcement caused far less consternation in Vienna than Metternich's previous bride, and they were married on 30 January 1831.&lt;ref name="palmer245"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=245–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1831 rebels took the cities of Parma, Modena and Bologna and appealed to France for help. Their former masters appealed for help from Austria, but Metternich was anxious not to march Austrian troops into the [[Papal States]] without authorisation from the new [[Pope Gregory XVI]]. He occupied Parma and Modena, however, and eventually did cross into Papal territory. As a result, Italy was pacified by the end of March. &lt;!-- As a result of his quick action Francis awarded him the Grand Cross of the [[Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary|Order of Saint Stephen]], set in diamonds. --&gt;He authorised troop withdrawal from the Papal States in July, but by January 1832 they were back to put down a second rebellion.&lt;ref name="palmer245"/&gt; By now Metternich was ageing noticeably: his hair was grey and his face drawn and sunken, although his wife still enjoyed his company. In February 1832 a daughter, also Melanie, was born; in 1833 a son, Klemens, though he died aged two months; in October 1834 a second son, Paul; and in 1837 his third with Melanie, Lothar. Politically, Metternich had a new adversary, [[Lord Palmerston]], who had taken over at the British Foreign Office in 1830. By the end of 1832 they had clashed on virtually every issue. "In short," Metternich wrote, "Palmerston is wrong about everything".&lt;ref name="palmer255"/&gt; Mostly, Metternich was annoyed by his insistence that under the 1815 agreements Britain had the right to oppose Austria's tightening of university controls in Germany, as Metternich had done again in 1832. Metternich also worried that if future congresses were held in Britain, as Palmerston wanted, his own influence would be significantly reduced.&lt;ref name="palmer255"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=255–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Question revisited and peace in Europe===
[[File:Metternich (c. 1835-40).jpg|thumb|right|Metternich in a painting thought to date to between 1835 and 1840]]

In 1831 Egypt [[Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–33)|invaded the Ottoman Empire]]. There were fears of the Empire's total collapse, by which Austria stood to gain little. Metternich therefore proposed multilateral support for the Ottomans and a Viennese congress to sort out details, but the French were evasive and the British refused to support any congress held in Vienna. By the summer of 1833 Anglo-Austrian relations had hit a new low. With Russia Metternich was more confident of exerting influence. He was mistaken, however, and left to observe from afar Russian intervention in the region (culminating in the [[Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi]]). He still arranged to meet with the King of Prussia at Teplitz and accompany Francis to meet Tsar Nicholas at [[Mnichovo Hradište|Münchengrätz]] in September 1833. The former meeting went well: Metternich still felt able to dominate the Prussians, despite their rising economic prominence in Europe.&lt;ref name="palmer255"/&gt; The latter was more strained but, as Nicholas warmed, three [[Münchengrätz Agreements]] were reached that shaped a new conservative league to uphold the existing order in Turkey, Poland, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Okey|2001|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich left happy; his sole disappointment was having to commit to being tougher on Polish nationalists.&lt;ref name="palmer255"/&gt; Almost immediately, he heard of the creation of the [[Quadruple Alliance (1834)|Quadruple Alliance]] of 1834 between Britain, France, Spain and Portugal. This alliance of liberals was such an affront to Austrian values that Palmerston wrote he "should like to see Metternich's face when he reads our treaty". It did indeed draw bitter condemnation, mostly because it provided occasion for an outbreak of war. Metternich tried two tacks: to intrigue for the removal of the British Foreign Secretary and to attempt (vainly) to build up cross-power bloc agreements. Palmerston did indeed leave office in November, but only temporarily and not by any of Metternich's attempts. Large-scale war, however, had been avoided and the Quadruple Alliance was beginning to disintegrate.&lt;ref name="palmer255"/&gt;

On 2 March 1835 Emperor Francis died, succeeded by his epileptic son [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]]. Despite widespread opinion that Ferdinand was a "ghost of a monarch", Metternich valued legitimacy highly and worked to keep the government running. He soon accompanied Ferdinand on his first meeting with Tsar Nicholas and the King of Prussia, again at Teplitz. Ferdinand was overwhelmed, especially as the delegations paraded into Prague. Overall, however, it was an untroubled meeting.&lt;ref name="palmer264"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=264–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next few years passed relatively peacefully for Metternich: diplomatic incident was limited to the occasional angry exchange with Palmerston and Metternich's failure to be a mediator between the British and Russians over their [[Black Sea]] dispute. He also put effort into bringing new technology like the [[railway]]s into Austria. The most pressing issue was Hungary, where Metternich remained reluctant to support the centrist (but still nationalist) Széchenyi. His hesitancy is "a sad commentary on his declining powers of political presence".&lt;ref name="palmer271"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=271–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; At court Metternich increasingly lost power to the rising star [[Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky]], particularly in his proposals to increase military budgets. After his failed attempt in 1836 to force constitutional reform (which would have afforded him greater influence)—largely thwarted by the more liberally minded [[Archduke John of Austria|Archduke John]]—Metternich was forced to share more power with Kolowrat and [[Archduke Louis of Austria|Archduke Ludwig]] as part of Austria's [[Secret State Conference]]. Decision making ground to a halt.&lt;ref name="palmer271"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Okey|2001|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertaining and maintaining his estates at Johannisberg, Königswart and [[Plasy]] (together with [[Mariánská Týnice]]) were consuming much of his resources at a time when he had four young children to support, causing him more stress.&lt;ref name="palmer271"/&gt;

Metternich had long predicted a new crisis in the East, and when the [[Second Turko-Egyptian War]] broke out in 1839 he was anxious to re-establish Austria's diplomatic credentials. He quickly gathered representatives in Vienna, whence on 27 July they issued a communiqué to Constantinople pledging support. However, Tsar Nicholas sent Metternich a message from St Petersburg challenging Vienna's claim to diplomatic centrality. Metternich worked so furiously that he fell ill, spending the next five weeks resting at Johannisberg.&lt;ref name="palmer279"/&gt; The Austrians lost the initiative, and Metternich had to accept that London would be the new centre of negotiations over the Eastern Question. Just three weeks after its creation, Metternich's [[European League of Great Powers]] (his diplomatic response to aggressive moves by French Prime Minister [[Adolphe Thiers]]) had become a mere curiosity. Little, too, was heard of his proposals to hold a congress in Germany. A separate attempt to strengthen the influence of ambassadors stationed in Vienna was also rejected. This set the tone for the rest of Metternich's chancellorship.&lt;ref name="palmer279"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=279–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; His illness had, it seemed to others, broken his love of being in office. Over the next decade his wife prepared quietly for his retirement or death in office. Metternich's work during the early 1840s was dominated again by Hungary and, more generally, questions of national identity within the diverse Austrian Empire. Here, Metternich "showed [moments of] acute perception". His Hungarian proposals came far too late, however, as [[Lajos Kossuth]] had already led the rise of a strong Hungarian nationalism. Metternich's support for other nationalities was patchy, since he only opposed those that threatened the unity of the Empire.&lt;ref name="palmer286"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=286–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Conference of State Metternich lost his principal ally [[Karel Clam-Martinic]] in 1840, which furthered the growing paralysis at the heart of Austrian government. Metternich now struggled to enforce even the level of censorship he desired. There were no major challenges to the regime from outside.&lt;ref name="palmer286"/&gt; Italy was quiet, and neither Metternich's attempt to lecture the new Prussian king [[Frederick William IV]] nor the boredom of the new British [[Queen Victoria]] at their first meeting posed immediate problems. Far more worrying was Tsar Nicholas, whose estimation of the Habsburg dynasty and Austria was low. After an impromptu tour of Italy in 1845 the Tsar unexpectedly stopped in Vienna. Already in a bad mood, he was an awkward guest, though in between criticisms of Austria he reassured Metternich that Russia was not about to invade the Ottoman Empire again. Two months later their countries were required to work together over the [[Galician slaughter]] and a declaration of independence from [[Kraków]]. Metternich authorised the occupation of the city and use of troops to restore order in surrounding areas, intent on undoing the pseudo-independence that had been granted Kraków in 1815. After months of negotiations with Prussia and Russia, Austria annexed the city in November 1846. Metternich regarded it as a personal victory, but it was an action of dubious utility: not only were Polish [[dissident]]s now officially part of Austria, the Europe-wide Polish dissident movement was now worked actively against the "Metternich system" that had overridden the rights enshrined in 1815. Britain and France appeared similarly outraged, although calls for Metternich's resignation were ignored. For the next two years Ferdinand could not abdicate in favour of his nephew without a regency; Metternich believed Austria would need him in the interim to hold government together.&lt;ref name="palmer286"/&gt;

==Revolution==
{{Further|Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg Areas}}
Though Metternich was tiring, memoranda kept pouring forth from his chancellery. Despite this he did not foresee the building crisis. The new Pope [[Pius IX]] was gaining a reputation as a liberal nationalist, counterbalancing Metternich and Austria; at the same time, the Empire experienced unemployment and rising prices as a result of poor harvests. Metternich was bemused at the outcry from Italians, the Pope, and Palmerston when he ordered the occupation of Papal-controlled [[Ferrara]] in the summer of 1847. Despite securing French agreement for the first time in years from [[François Guizot]] over the [[Sonderbund War|Swiss Civil War]], France and Austria were forced into backing breakaway cantons.&lt;ref name="palmer298"/&gt; The pair proposed a conference, but the government crushed the revolt. It was a major blow to Metternich's prestige, and his opponents in Vienna called it evidence of his incompetence. In January 1848 Metternich predicted trouble in Italy during the year ahead.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Sicily [[Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848|erupted in revolution]] only a fortnight later, but it was Rome he had pinpointed as the epicentre of future trouble{{harv|Palmer|1972|pp=298–311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He acted on this by dispatching an envoy, [[Count Karl Ludwig von Ficquelmont|Karl Ludwig von Ficquelmont]] to Italy; by resurrecting his 1817 plans for an Italian chancellery; and by arranging various contingency plans with the French. In late February Austrian Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Joseph Radetsky]] placed Austrian Italy (Lombardy-Venetia) under [[martial law]] as disturbances spread. Despite this and hearing of renewed [[French Revolution of 1848|revolution in France]], Metternich was cautious, still thinking domestic revolution unlikely.&lt;ref name="palmer298"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=298–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described by a Saxon diplomat as, in the words of biographer Musulin, "having shrunk to a shadow of his former self".&lt;ref name="musulin305"/&gt;

{{rquote|right|I am no longer anybody... I have nothing more to do, nothing more to discuss.|Metternich after resigning {{harv|Palmer|1972|p=313}}.}}

On 3 March Kossuth gave a fiery speech in the Hungarian Diet, calling for a constitution.&lt;ref name="musulin305"&gt;{{harvnb|Musulin|1975|pp=305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 10 March that Metternich appeared concerned about events in Vienna, where there were now threats and counter-threats flying. Two [[petition]]s were organised, calling for greater freedom, transparency, and representation. Students were involved in several demonstrations, culminating on 13 March when they cheered the imperial family but voiced anger at Metternich. After a customary morning, Metternich was called to meet with Archduke Ludwig soon after midday.&lt;ref name="palmer298"/&gt; The Chancellor had troops sent into the streets while also announcing a prearranged and minimal concession. In the afternoon the crowd turned hostile, and a division of troops opened fire on it, killing five. The mob was now truly incited, as the liberals were joined by underprivileged Viennese set on wreaking havoc.&lt;ref name="palmer298"/&gt; The students offered to form a pro-government [[Academic Legion (Vienna)|Academic Legion]] if their demands were met. Ludwig was eager to accept and told Metternich he must resign, to which he reluctantly agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Okey|2001|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; After sleeping in the Chancellery he was advised to either take back his resignation or leave the city. After Ludwig sent him a message to the effect that the government could not guarantee his safety, Metternich left for the house of [[Viscount Taaffe|Count Taaffe]] and then, with aid from friends [[Charles von Hügel]] and [[Count Johann Bernhard von Rechberg und Rothenlöwen|Johann Rechberg]], reached the family seat of [[Monarchy of Liechtenstein|Prince Liechtenstein]] forty miles away at [[Feldsberg]]. Metternich's daughter Leontine joined them on 21 March and suggested England as a haven; agreeing, Metternich, Melanie and 19-year-old Richard set out, leaving the younger children with Leontine.&lt;ref name="palmer312"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=312–319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich's resignation had been met with cheering in Vienna, and even the Viennese [[commoner]]s welcomed the end of Metternich's era of social conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Musulin|1975|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile, return, and death==
After an anxious journey of nine days during which they were honoured in some towns and refused entry to others, Metternich, his wife, and son Richard arrived in the Dutch city of [[Arnhem]]. They stayed until Metternich regained his strength, then reached Amsterdam and The Hague, where they waited to hear the results of a demonstration by English [[Chartism|chartists]], planned for 10 April. On 20 April they landed at [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]] in London, where they stayed in the Brunswick Hotel in [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square]] for a fortnight until they found a permanent residence. Metternich largely enjoyed his time in London: the Duke of Wellington, now nearly eighty, tried to keep him entertained, and there were also visits from Palmerston, Guizot (now also in exile) and [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who enjoyed his political conversation. The sole disappointment was that Victoria herself did not acknowledge his presence in the capital. The trio leased a house, 44 [[Eaton Square]], for four months. The younger children joined them in the summer. He followed events in Austria from afar,&lt;ref name="palmer312"/&gt; famously denying ever having erred; in fact, he declared the turmoil in Europe to be vindication of his policies. In Vienna, a hostile post-censorship press continued to attack him; in particular, they accused him of [[embezzlement]] and accepting bribes, prompting an investigation. Metternich was eventually cleared of the more extreme charges, and searches for evidence of the lesser ones came up empty handed. (In all likelihood Metternich's large expense claims were merely a product of the necessities of early 19th century diplomacy.) Meanwhile, as he was denied his pension, Metternich was ironically reliant on loans.&lt;ref name="palmer312"/&gt;

[[File:Metternich Klemens Fst.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of Prince Metternich in old age]]

In mid-September the family moved to 42 Brunswick Terrace, [[Brighton]] on the south coast of England where tranquillity of life contrasted greatly with the revolutionary Europe left behind. Parliamentary figures, particularly Disraeli, travelled down to visit them, as did Metternich's former friend [[Dorothea Lieven]] (Melanie led a reconciliation between the two). Expecting a visit from Metternich's daughter Leontine and her own daughter Pauline, the family moved to a suite of rooms at [[Richmond Palace]] on 23 April 1849. Visitors included Wellington, who still watched out for Metternich; [[Johann Strauss I|Johann Strauss]], the composer; and Dorothea de Dino, sister of Metternich's former lover Wilhemine of Sagan;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Several biographers accept the young Pauline's testimony that it was actually Wilhemine who visited. This contradicts, however, the established date of Wilhemine's death—1839 {{harv|Palmer|1972|p=322}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and former lover Katharina Bagration.&lt;ref name="palmer319"/&gt; Metternich was showing his age, and his frequent fainting was cause for worry. The ex-Chancellor was also depressed by the lack of communication from the new Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] and his government. Leontine wrote to Vienna trying to encourage this contact, and in August Metternich received a warm letter from Franz Joseph; sincere or not, it buoyed Metternich considerably. From mid-August Melanie began to push for a move to [[Brussels]], a city cheaper to live in and closer to continental affairs. They arrived in October, staying overnight in the Hotel Bellevue. With revolution subsiding, Metternich was hopeful they would return to Vienna. Their stay in fact lasted over 18 months while Metternich waited for an opportunity to re-enter Austrian politics. It was a pleasant enough (and cheap) stay, first in the Boulevard de l'Observatoire and later in the [[Sablon (Brussels)|Sablon]] area—filled with visits from politicians, writers, musicians and scientists. For Metternich, however, the tedium and homesickness only increased. In March 1851 Melanie induced him to write to the new political force in Vienna, [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]], to ask if he might return if he promised not to interfere in public affairs. In April he received an affirmative reply, authorised by Franz Joseph.&lt;ref name="palmer319"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=319–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1851 Metternich left for his Johannisberg estate, which he had last visited in 1845. That summer Metternich enjoyed the company of Prussian representative [[Otto von Bismarck]]. He also enjoyed a visit from Frederick William, though the King irritated Metternich by appearing to cultivate him as a tool against Schwarzenberg. In September Metternich returned to Vienna, entertained along the way by various German princes keen to entertain the focus of Prussian intrigue.&lt;ref name="palmer319"/&gt; Metternich was reinvigorated, dropped his nostalgia, and lived in the present for the first time in a decade. Franz Josef asked for his advice on numerous issues (though he was too headstrong to be much influenced by it), and both of the two emerging factions in Vienna courted Metternich; even Tsar Nicholas called on him during a state visit. Metternich was not keen on the new Foreign Minister, [[Count Karl Ferdinand von Buol|Karl Ferdinand von Buol]] but thought him sufficiently incompetent that he would be impressionable. Metternich's advice was of varying quality; nonetheless, some of it was usefully insightful, even in modern issues. Now deaf, Metternich wrote endlessly, particularly for an appreciative Franz Josef. He wanted Austrian neutrality in the [[Crimean War]], though Buol did not.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;When Buol signed an alliance with the Western powers in December 1855—albeit one that did not commit troops—Metternich would have noted with regret how Buol had broken the bonds with Russia he had cultivated for so long{{harv|Palmer|1972|pp=328–340}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime Metternich's health was slowly failing, and he was a more peripheral figure after the death of his wife Melanie in January 1854. In a brief resurgence of energy in early 1856, he busied himself in arrangements for a marriage between his son Richard and his granddaughter Pauline (Richard's step-sister's daughter) and undertook more travel. The King of the Belgians came to visit, as did Bismarck, and on 16 August 1857 he entertained the future [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]]. Buol, however, was growing more resentful of Metternich's advice, particularly about Italy. In April 1859 Franz Josef came to ask him about what should be done in Italy. According to Pauline, Metternich begged him not to send an ultimatum to Italy, and Franz Josef explained that such an ultimatum had already been sent.&lt;ref name="palmer328"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=328–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way, much to Metternich's disappointment and to Franz Josef's embarrassment, Austria began the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against the combined forces of Piedmont-Sardinia and its ally France. Though Metternich was able to secure the replacement of Buol with his friend Rechberg, who had helped him so much in 1848, involvement in the war itself was now beyond his capacity. Even a special task given him by Franz Josef in June 1859—to draw up secret papers addressing the event of Franz Josef's death—was now too taxing. Shortly afterwards Metternich died in Vienna on 11 June 1859, aged 86, and the last great figure of his generation. Almost everyone of note in Vienna came to pay tribute; in the foreign press his death went virtually unnoticed.&lt;ref name="palmer328"/&gt;

==Historians' assessment==
{{main|Historical assessment of Klemens von Metternich}}
{{Conservatism sidebar |People}}
Historians agree on Metternich's skill as a diplomat and his dedication to conservatism. According to Arthur May, he believed that:
: the mass of Europeans yearned for security, quiet, and peace, and regarded liberal abstractions as repugnant or were utterly indifferent to them. The best of all patterns of government, he insisted, was autocratic absolutism, upheld by a loyal army, by a submissive, decently efficient bureaucracy and police machine, and by trustworthy churchmen. &lt;ref&gt; Arthur J. May, ''The Age of Metternich: 1814-1848 '' (2nd ed 1963), pp 3-4. &lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly during the remainder of the nineteenth century, Metternich was heavily criticised, decried as the man who prevented Austria and the rest of central Europe from "developing along normal liberal and constitutional lines".&lt;ref name="sked43"&gt;{{harvnb|Sked|1983|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had Metternich not stood in the way of "progress", Austria might have reformed, dealt better with its problems of nationality, and the [[First World War]] might never have happened.&lt;ref name="sked43" /&gt; Instead, Metternich chose to fight an overwhelmingly fruitless war against the forces of liberalism and nationalism.&lt;ref name="okey98"&gt;{{harvnb|Okey|2001|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy censorship was just one of a range of [[Political repression|repressive]] instruments of state available to him that also included a large spy network.&lt;ref name="palmer225"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=225–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metternich opposed electoral reform, criticising Britain’s 1832 [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bertier de Sauvigny|1962|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, he locked himself into an embittered battle against "the prevailing mood of his age".&lt;ref name="palmer1"/&gt;

On the other hand, Metternich’s diplomacy and statesmanship became the focus of praise in the twentieth century from more favourably inclined historians, particularly biographer [[Heinrich von Srbik]].&lt;ref name="okey75"&gt;{{harvnb|Okey|2001|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, particularly after WWII, historians were more likely to defend Metternich’s policies as reasonable attempts to achieve his goals, chiefly the balance of power in Europe.&lt;ref name="sked45"&gt;{{harvnb|Sked|1983|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sympathetic historians point out that Metternich correctly foresaw and worked to prevent Russian dominance in Europe, succeeding where his successors would fail 130 years later.&lt;ref name="sked45"/&gt; As argued by Srbik, Metternich himself pursued legality, cooperation, and dialogue, and therefore helped ensure thirty years of peace, the “[[Age of Metternich]]”. Authors like [[Peter Viereck]] and [[Ernst B. Haas]] also give Metternich credit for his more liberal ideals, even if they weighed relatively little in his overall policies.&lt;ref name="sked46"&gt;{{harvnb|Sked|1983|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical views presuppose Metternich had the ability to shape Europe favorably but chose not to. More modern critiques like that of [[A. J. P. Taylor]] have questioned how much influence Metternich actually wielded.&lt;ref name="sked43"/&gt; Robin Okey, a critic of Metternich, noted that even in the realm of foreign affairs Metternich “had only his own persuasiveness to rely on”, and this degraded over time.&lt;ref name="okey75"/&gt; By this interpretation, his task was to create a “smokescreen” that hid Austria’s true weakness. When it came to choosing a set of sound principles, wrote Taylor, “most men could do better while shaving.”&lt;ref name="sked44"&gt;{{harvnb|Sked|1983|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was that Metternich was no captivating diplomat: Taylor described him as “the most boring man in European history.”&lt;ref name="sked43"/&gt; Not only were his failures limited to foreign affairs, critics argue: at home he was equally powerless, failing to effect even his own proposals for administrative reform.&lt;ref name="okey75"/&gt; In contrast, those who have attempted to rehabilitate Metternich describe him as “unquestionably [a] master of diplomacy”,&lt;ref name="Ford1970"&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|1971|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; someone who perfected and indeed shaped the nature of diplomacy in his era.&lt;ref name="palmer1"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1972|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, [[Alan Sked]] argues that Metternich’s “smokescreen” may well have served a purpose in furthering a relatively coherent set of principles.&lt;ref name="sked46"/&gt;

[[Image:Dr Frank by Press3.jpg|thumb|Dr. Konstantin Frank|400px|right]]
Dr. '''Konstantin Frank''' (1899–1985) was a [[viticulture|viticulturist]] and [[winemaker]] in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of [[New York (state)|New York]].  He was born in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]) and received his PhD in [[viticulture]] from the Odessa Polytechnic Institute, his thesis being on techniques for growing ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' in a cold climate.  After working for a time in what was then [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Georgia]] managing a large state-owned vineyard, he came to the [[United States]] in 1951. Speaking nine languages, English not being one of them, Frank was forced to take a job as a dishwasher in [[New York City]]. When he could save up enough, Frank moved with his family to the [[Cornell University]] [[Geneva Experiment Station]] in 1953. During the 1950s, he was a consultant to the [[Gold Seal Winery]] and established a ''Vitis vinifera'' grape nursery.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=103596|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Gold Seal Winery|date=April 2010|accessdate=2012-08-05|author=Robert T. Englert|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003153754/http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=103596|archivedate=2016-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He urged [[New York State]] winemakers to move away from native North American grapes, including ''[[Vitis labrusca]]'' and other species, and instead plant ''Vitis vinifera'', the traditional grapes of [[Europe]]an winemakers. For 300 years, failed attempts to plant "Vitis vinifera" varieties were blamed on the cold weather. With extensive experience growing the European grapes in below freezing temperatures back in [[Ukraine]], Frank knew it would be possible with the techniques that he developed. 

His ideas were ridiculed.  No one thought that ''Vitis vinifera'' would grow in cold [[Upstate New York]]. So in 1958 Frank bought a plot of land on the west side of [[Keuka Lake]], about six miles from Hammondsport, NY. The first vintage released was in 1962 with a [[Trockenbeerenauslese]] Johannisberg Riesling made from [[Botrytis cinerea|botrytized]] grapes. A scientist at heart, Frank, in the twenty-three years that he owned his winery, planted over sixty different varieties to prove to the world that the eastern United States could grow the noble European vinifera grape varieties. In 1985, Frank died at the age of 86. His legacy is cherished in New York, paving the way for other Finger Lakes producers to grow the European grape varieties. In November 2001, Konstantin Frank was inducted into the [[Wine Spectator]] Hall of Fame for his outstanding achievements in the field of viticulture.

Konstantin's son, Willy Frank, became President after his father's death and surprised some in the industry by introducing [[sparkling wines]] made in the traditional [[methode champenoise]] technique. He purchased a historic field stone house, then restored it into a sparkling winery and named it Chateau Frank. In 1993, Fred Frank, Konstantin's grandson, succeeded his father as President of Dr. Konstantin Frank Vinifera Wine Cellars. That same year, he introduced a value line called "Salmon Run" using grapes sourced from local farms around the Finger Lakes.

The son of Joseph A. Desjardins and Valentine Desautels,&lt;ref name="normandin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Canadian Parliamentary Guide |year=1965 |last=Normandin |first=Pierre G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desjardins was educated at ''St. Boniface College'', ''St. Paul's College'' and the ''[[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] College of Embalming''.  Desjardins played professional [[Canadian football|football]] with the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]]. He was general manager of the St. Boniface Jr. Canadians and was a scout for the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. He was inducted into Manitoba’s sports hall of fame in 1990. He served in the Canadian navy during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="gentle"/&gt; He worked as a funeral director, and was the President and Managing Director of ''Chapels, Ltd''.  He also joined the [[Knights of Columbus]] and the [[Canadian Centre for Diversity|Canadian Council of Christian and Jews]] during the early years of his career.&lt;ref name="mhs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/desjardins_ll.shtml |work=Memorable Manitobans |title=Laurent Louis "Larry" Desjardins (1923-2012) |publisher=[[Manitoba Historical Society]] |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he married Bernice McGuire.&lt;ref name="normandin"/&gt;

Desjardins began his political career at the municipal level, serving as an [[alderman]] on the St. Boniface City Council from 1951 to 1954, and also serving on the St. Boniface Hospital Board for a number of years.&lt;ref name="mhs"/&gt; In the [[Manitoba general election, 1959|Manitoba general election of 1959]], he was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the riding of [[St. Boniface (Manitoba riding)|St. Boniface]] as a [[Liberal Party of Manitoba|Liberal-Progressive]].  This was the year of [[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba|Progressive Conservative]] Premier [[Dufferin Roblin]]'s first majority win, and Desjardins joined ten other Liberal-Progressives in the official opposition.&lt;ref name="members"/&gt;

In 1961, Desjardins emerged as one of the leading parliamentary supporters of government funding for private and denominational schools.  A [[Roman Catholic]] and a [[francophone]], Desjardins regarded such funding as necessary for redressing anti-francophone legislation that had been pursued by previous Manitoba governments in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The Roblin government took some steps on this front, but the issue was still unresolved by the 1970s.

Despite the Roblin government's popularity, Desjardins had little difficulty being returned in the elections of [[Manitoba general election, 1962|1962]] and [[Manitoba general election, 1966|1966]] (the Liberal-Progressives had changed their name to the [[Manitoba Liberal Party]] in 1961).  In the [[Manitoba general election, 1969|election of 1969]], Desjardins faced stronger-than-usual competition from his New Democratic opponent (one [[Kam Gajdosik]]), but won by 4210 votes to 2656.

The 1969 election was a watershed in Manitoba politics, and resulted in a dramatic shift in Desjardins's career.  Under Edward Schreyer's leadership, the [[social-democratic]] NDP moved from third to first place, winning 28 seats out of 57 in the assembly.  This was one short of a majority, and there was initial uncertainty as to which party or parties would form government.  There was some consideration of an "anti-socialist coalition", which would have brought together all parties except the NDP under the leadership of former Liberal leader [[Gildas Molgat]].  This, however, did not occur.  The impasse was ended when Desjardians announced that he would offer parliamentary support to the NDP, and change his party affiliation to ''Liberal-Democrat''.

Desjardins's change of affiliation was significant, and on some levels surprising.  He had previously been known as an opponent of [[socialism]], and Manitoba's francophone population had not traditionally been supportive of the New Democratic Party before this time.  Nevertheless, Desjardins was able to form an alliance with Schreyer (himself a centrist New Democrat), on the understanding that he would be able to continue to work in favour of denominational school funding on the government side.

In order to make sure this move was supported by his constituents, Desjardins organized a vote of confidence on this decision on July 8. Had he lost this vote, Desjardins would have resigned as MLA, and would have run as a Liberal-Democrat candidate in a subsequent by-election. About 1000 people showed up at the Louis Riel School gymnasium for the vote of canfidence, and Desjardins received a standing ovation when he arrived in the hall. The vast majority of the attendees gave their support to Desjardins, with only 13 people opposing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Desjardins is supported in NDP move|last=|first=|date=July 9, 1969|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=|archive-url=|page=1|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desjardins became Schreyer's legislative assistant in 1969, and formally joined the New Democratic Party in 1971.

On December 1, 1971, Desjardins was appointed [[Manitoba Minister of Tourism, Recreation and Cultural Affairs|Minister of Tourism, Recreation and Cultural Affairs]].&lt;ref name="members"/&gt;  In July 1972, his efforts in support of denominational schools were dealt a setback when a government-sponsored bill to permit funding was defeated by a free vote in the legislature.  (The Schreyer government did, however, make administrative agreements with certain private schools to provide them with access to public monies.)

Given the lack of historical francophone support for the NDP in Manitoba, it was unclear if Desjardins would be re-elected in the [[Manitoba general election, 1973|provincial election of 1973]], and his riding was targeted by a right-wing "citizen's" group in the amalgamated city of [[Winnipeg]] (which included St. Boniface).  This group convinced the Progressive Conservative Party to withdraw their candidate in St. Boniface, so as to provide a single "anti-socialist" alternative to the NDP.

Desjardins's sole opponent in June 1973 was Liberal candidate [[J. Paul Marion]].  Following a very close race, Marion was declared the winner by a single vote (4301 to 4300).  This result was disputed, however, and was subsequently overturned by the [[Controverted Elections Act]].  In December 1974, Desjardins defeated Marion in a by-election&lt;ref name="members"/&gt; by over 600 votes.

Schreyer's New Democrats were re-elected in the 1973 campaign.  Desjardins had resigned from cabinet on January 28, 1974, during the ongoing controversy concerning the St. Boniface results, but on December 23, 1974, he was re-admitted to cabinet as [[Manitoba Minister of Health and Social Development|Minister of Health and Social Development]].  On January 8, 1975, he was also given responsibility for the [[Manitoba Lotteries Act (Manitoba ministry)|Manitoba Lotteries Act]].&lt;ref name="members"/&gt;

Desjardins was easily re-elected in the [[Manitoba general election, 1977|1977 election]], although Schreyer's New Democrats were defeated provincially by the Progressive Conservatives under [[Sterling Lyon]].  Desjardins sat as a member of the opposition for the next four years.

The New Democrats were returned to power in the [[Manitoba general election, 1981|provincial election of 1981]] under the leadership of [[Howard Pawley]], and Desjardins was personally re-elected without difficulty.  He was re-appointed to cabinet on November 30, 1981, serving as [[Manitoba Minister of Health|Minister of Health]] and [[Manitoba Minister of Recreation and Sport|Minister of Recreation and Sport]], with responsibility for the [[Lotteries and Gaming Control Act (Manitoba ministry)|Lotteries and Gaming Control Act]].  He was re-designated as Minister of Health with responsibility for [[Minister responsible for Sport, the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act, and the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act (Manitoba)|Minister responsible for Sport, the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act, and the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act]] and the [[Manitoba Lotteries Foundation Act (Manitoba ministry)|Manitoba Lotteries Foundation Act]].&lt;ref name="members"/&gt;

During the 1980s, Desjardins was a prominent supporter of Howard Pawley's efforts to expand and entrench French-language services in Manitoba.

On January 30, 1985, Desjardins was shifted to the [[Manitoba Minister of Urban Affairs|Ministry of Urban Affairs]].  He was again re-elected without difficulty in the [[Manitoba general election, 1986|1986 provincial election]], and on April 17, 1986, he was re-appointed [[Manitoba Minister of Health and Sport|Minister of Health and Sport]] (once again holding responsibility for the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act and the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act).&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/hansard/members/mla_bio_deceased.html#D0 |title=MLA Biographies - Deceased |work=Legislative Assembly of Manitoba |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330155427/http://www.gov.mb.ca/hansard/members/mla_bio_deceased.html |archivedate=2014-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desjardins resigned from his cabinet positions on February 10, 1988, after a Supreme Court ruling that provinces could not restrict a woman's right to abortion,&lt;ref name="gentle"/&gt; and announced that he would be leaving the legislature to take a job in the private sector.  His seat was not formally declared vacant, but he stopped attending sessions of the legislature after this period. He then served as head of the Manitoba Health Organization until 1990.&lt;ref name="mort"/&gt;

Ironically, just as Desjardins had helped bring the NDP into government in 1969, his decision to leave the legislature in 1988 played a major role in the party's unexpected fall from power.  In his absence, the legislature was almost evenly divided between government and opposition members; as such, NDP backbencher [[Jim Walding]]'s decision to vote against his government's budget was enough to defeat the Pawley ministry in the house.&lt;ref name="gentle"/&gt;  The NDP lost the election which followed, and did not return to power until 1999.

During his time in the legislature, Desjardins was known as a personable figure (fellow New Democratic cabinet minister [[Russell Doern]] once called him a "[[Rabelais|Rabelasian]] character").  He was regarded as cautious and pragmatic, and was often more supportive of small-business interests than others in the New Democratic Party.  Desjardins was a member of the federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] for most, if not all of time in the provincial NDP.  This practice is no longer possible; the federal NDP is now integrated with its provincial and territorial branches. He openly supported Liberal [[Lloyd Axworthy]]'s successful bid to enter the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="gentle"/&gt;

During the 1990s, Desjardins led a policy review group which studied Manitoba's lotteries system, and argued against the expansion of Manitoba's [[casino]] economy.  In 2002, he wrote an open letter on health-care reform in, arguing that money alone would not resolve the problems within the system.  In March 2003, he participated in a discussion on health-care funding at the ''Frontier Centre for Public Policy'', in which he argued that Canada's provinces should be permitted to enact user fees and expand the role of the private sector in health-care provision. He served as first president of the [[Western Canada Lottery Corporation|Western Canada Lottery Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halloffame.mb.ca/honoured/1990/lDesjardins.htm |title=Larry Desjardins |publisher=Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame |accessdate=2013-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014192046/http://www.halloffame.mb.ca/honoured/1990/lDesjardins.htm |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desjardins died at the [[Victoria General Hospital (Winnipeg)|Victoria Hospital]] in Winnipeg following a fall.&lt;ref name="mort"/&gt;

'''Louis Martin''' (22 August 1823 – 29 July 1894) and '''Marie-Azélie "Zélie" Guérin Martin''' (23 December 1831 – 28 August 1877) were two married Roman Catholic French laypeople and the parents of five Roman Catholic nuns, including [[Thérèse of Lisieux]], a [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[nun]] who was [[Canonization|canonized]] as a saint of the [[Catholic Church]] in 1925. On 18 October 2015, the couple were also canonized as saints, becoming the first spouses in the church's history to be canonized as a couple.&lt;ref name="osvziegler"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.osv.com/osvnewsweekly/byissue/article/tabid/735/artmid/13636/articleid/17360/history-awaits-in-canonization-of-married-couple.aspx?ref=top10|title=History awaits in canonization of married couple|date=22 April 2015|first=J.J.|last=Ziegler|publisher=OSV Newsweekly|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Louis Martin===
Louis Joseph Aloys Stanislaus Martin was the third of five children of Pierre-François Martin and Marie-Anne-Fanny Boureau.&lt;ref name="biocarm"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/52709303e4b08363c17ac8fd/t/54dc0127e4b01b81e4da47f3/1423704359484/BIOGRAPHICAL+PROFILE+OF+THE+VENERABLE+SERVANTS+OF+GOD.pdf|title=Biographical Profile of the Venerable Servants of God|publisher=Office of the Postulator General of the Discalced Carmelites|date=19 October 2008|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All his siblings died before reaching age 30.

Although Louis intended to become a [[monk]], wishing to enter the [[Augustinian Order|Augustinian]] [[Great St Bernard Hospice|Great St. Bernard Monastery]], he was rejected because he did not succeed at learning Latin.&lt;ref name="biocarm"/&gt; Later he decided to become a [[watchmaker]] and studied his craft in [[Rennes]] and in [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref name="biocarm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="louisreliable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louiszeliemartin-alencon.fr/en/la-famille-martin/louis-a-reliable-and-committed-man|work=The Martin Family|title=Louis a reliable and committed man|publisher=Sanctuaire d'Alençon|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azélie-Marie Guérin===
{{moresources|section|date=October 2016}}
Azélie-Marie Guérin was born in Gandelain, near [[Saint-Denis-sur-Sarthon]], [[Orne]], France. She was the second daughter of Isidore Guérin and Louise-Jeanne Macé.&lt;ref name="zeliemodern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louiszeliemartin-alencon.fr/en/la-famille-martin/test-en|work=The Martin Family|title=Zélie, a modern woman|publisher=Sanctuaire d'Alençon|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had an older sister, Marie-Louise, who became a [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary|Visitandine]] nun, and a younger brother, Isidore, who was a [[pharmacist]]. Her maternal family was from the Madré, in the neighbouring department of Mayenne, where her grandfather, Louis Macé, was baptised on 16 March 1778.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Zélie wanted to become a nun, but was turned away by the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul]] due to respiratory difficulties and recurrent headaches. She then prayed for God to give her many children and that they would be consecrated to God. She later decided to become a lacemaker, manufacturing [[Alençon lace]].&lt;ref name="zeliemodern"/&gt; She fell in love with the watchmaker Louis Martin in 1858 and married him, only three months later, on 12 July 1858, at the [[Basilica of Notre-Dame d'Alençon|Basilica of Notre-Dame]] in [[Alençon]].&lt;ref name="zeliemodern"/&gt; Zélie's business became so successful that, in 1870, Louis sold his watchmaking business to go into partnership with her.

==Marriage and family==
Although the couple lived as brother and sister for ten months after their wedding, they decided to live as husband and wife after a spiritual director encouraged them to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''Louis et Zelie Martin: une saintete pour tous les temps'', by Jean Clapier.  Paris, Presses de la Renaissance, 2009, pp. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; They would later have nine children, though only five daughters would survive infancy:

#''Marie Louise'' (22 February 1860 – 19 January 1940), as a nun, ''Sister Marie of the Sacred Heart'', Carmelite at Lisieux;
#''[[Agnes of Jesus (religious)|Marie Pauline]]'' (7 September 1861 – 28 July 1951), as a nun, ''Mother Agnès of Jesus'', Carmelite at Lisieux;
#''[[Léonie Martin|Marie Léonie]]'' (3 June 1863 – 16 June 1941), as a nun, ''Sister Françoise-Thérèse'', Visitandine at Caen; candidate for sainthood since January 2015;
#''Marie Hélène'' (3 October 1864 – 22 February 1870);
#''Joseph Louis'' (20 September 1866 – 14 February 1867);
#''Joseph Jean-Baptiste'' (19 December 1867 – 24 August 1868);
#''[[Genevieve of the Holy Face|Marie Céline]]'' (28 April 1869 – 25 February 1959), as a nun, ''Sister Geneviève of the Holy Face'', Carmelite at Lisieux;
#''Marie Mélanie-Thérèse'' (16 August 1870 – 8 October 1870);
#''[[Thérèse de Lisieux|Marie Françoise-Thérèse]]'' (2 January 1873 – 30 September 1897), as a nun, ''Sister Thérèse of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face'', Carmelite at Lisieux, canonised in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thereseoflisieux.org/storm-of-glory-therese-from-18/ | title = Storm of Glory: St. Therese of Lisieux from 1897–2014| work = Saint Therese of Lisieux: A Gateway | first = Maureen | last = O'Riordan | accessdate = 18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a father, Louis loved nature with a deep sentimental enthusiasm. It was from him that Thérèse inherited her passion for flowers and meadows, and for her native landscape, clouds, thunderstorms, the sea and the stars. He made pilgrimages to [[Chartres]] and [[Lourdes]], went to Germany and Austria, travelled twice to [[Rome]] and even to [[Constantinople]], and planned, but did not live to carry out, a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name="gorres41"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Hidden Face | first = Ida | last = Görres | publisher =  Ignatius Press | year = 2003 | authorlink = Ida Friederike Görres | page = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this desire for adventure was an impulse towards withdrawal; in Lisieux Louis arranged a little den for himself high up in the attic, a true monastic cell for praying, reading and meditation. Even his daughters were allowed to enter it only if they wished spiritual converse and self-examination. As in a monastery, he divided the day into worship, garden work and relaxation. As a jeweller and watchmaker, Louis loved the precious things with which he dealt. To his daughters he gave touching and naïve pet names: Marie was his "diamond", Pauline his "noble pearl", Céline "the bold one", and "the guardian angel". Thérèse was his "little queen ... to whom all treasures belonged".&lt;ref name="gorres42"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Hidden Face | first = Ida | last = Görres | publisher =  Ignatius Press | year = 2003 | page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Zélie died of [[breast cancer]] on 28 August 1877 in Alençon, aged 45, leaving her husband and daughters.&lt;ref name="zeliemodern"/&gt; Her funeral was held in the basilica where she had married Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogster.com/canadiancatholicblog/ste-thrse-lisieux | title=Ste. Thérèse of Lisieux Part 1 - Her Family|work=canadiancatholicblog|date=21 October 2007|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Louis sold her lacemaking business and their house along Rue St. Blaise,&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louiszeliemartin-alencon.fr/en/venir-en-pelerinage/the-family-home|title=The family home|publisher=Sanctuaire d'Alençon|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to [[Lisieux]], [[Normandy]], where Zélie's brother Isidore Guérin, a pharmacist, lived with his wife and two daughters.

After Zélie's death, Pauline, Thérèse (Françoise-Thérèse), and Céline all became Carmelite nuns, along with a cousin, Marie Guérin. Léonie became a Visitandine nun at [[Caen]] after leaving the [[Poor Clares]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leoniemartin.org|title=Léonie Martin, Disciple and Sister of St. Thérèse of Lisieux|first=Maureen|last=O'Riordan|year=2013|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889 Louis suffered two paralyzing strokes followed by [[Arteriosclerosis|cerebral arteriosclerosis]], and was hospitalised for three years at the Bon Sauveur Asylum in Caen. In 1892 he returned to Lisieux, where two of his daughters looked after him until his death on 29 July 1894 at Chateau La Musse near [[Évreux]].{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Louis and Zélie were declared "[[venerable]]" on 26 March 1994 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. They were [[Beatification|beatified]] on 19 October 2008 by [[José Saraiva Martins|José Saraiva Cardinal Martins]], the legate of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in the [[Basilica of St. Thérèse, Lisieux|Basilica of Saint Thérèse]], [[Lisieux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsaints.info/saint-louis-martin|title=Saint Louis Martin|work=CatholicSaints.info|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months earlier, the Catholic Church had recognized the miracle  of Pietro Schiliro, an Italian child cured of lung trouble at their intercession.&lt;ref name="firstmiracle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louiszeliemartin-alencon.fr/en/la-famille-martin/les-etapes-du-chemin-de-la-canonisation/the-first-miracle-of-louis-and-zelie-martin-the-blessed|title=The first miracle of Louis and Zélie Martin, the Blessed|publisher=Sanctuaire d'Alençon|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Louis and Zélie to be canonized, the church needed to find that God worked a second miracle at their intercession.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

==Canonizations==
[[File:Louis and Marie-Azélie Martin.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Canonization tapestry in 2015.]]
On 7 January 2013, [[Carlos Osoro Sierra]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|Archbishop of Valencia]], presided at the opening of the canonical process to inquire into the healing in 2008 of a girl named Carmen, who was born in Valencia four days before Louis and Zélie were beatified.&lt;ref name="secondmiracle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louiszeliemartin-alencon.fr/en/la-famille-martin/les-etapes-du-chemin-de-la-canonisation/the-second-miracle-of-louis-and-zelie-martin-the-blessed|title=The second miracle of Louis and Zélie Martin, the Blessed|publisher=Sanctuaire d'Alençon|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carmen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thereseoflisieux.org/my-blog-about-st-therese/2013/1/20/the-cure-of-carmen-is-this-the-miracle-that-will-make-blesse.html|work=Saint Therese of Lisieux: A Gateway|title=The cure of Carmen: Is this the miracle that will make Blessed Louis and Zelie Martin, the parents of St. Therese of Lisieux, canonized saints?|first=Maureen|last=O'Riordan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight doctors testified that there was no scientific explanation for her cure.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

On 3 March 2015 [[Angelo Amato|Angelo Cardinal Amato]] announced informally that Louis and Zélie Martin would be declared saints during the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)|Synod of Bishops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/canonization-of-st-therese-s-parents-to-coincide-with-synod-on-the-family|title=Canonization of St. Therese's Parents to Coincide with Synod on the Family|publisher=ZENIT|date=3 March 2015|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregation accepted and promulgated the miracle on 18 March 2015.&lt;ref name="popefrancisrec"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ncronline.org/news/global/pope-francis-recognizes-miracle-needed-declare-french-couple-saints|title=Pope Francis recognizes miracle needed to declare French couple saints|first=Cindy|last=Wooden|publisher=National Catholic Reporter|date=18 March 2015|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2015, ''Miracle of Life in Valencia'', a film produced by the Archdiocese of Valencia about the canonization miracle was released online in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvge_IFsN5k|title=Miracle of life in Valencia|date=25 June 2015|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=19 December 2015|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, at a consistory of cardinals in Rome, Pope Francis approved the decree for the canonization of Louis and Zélie Martin and announced that the ceremony would take place in October in Rome.&lt;ref name="popefrancisrec"/&gt;

On 18 October 2015, Louis and Azélie-Marie Martin were canonized as saints by Pope Francis.&lt;ref name="canonizationmass"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/280240|date=18 October 2015|publisher=News.va|title=Santa Messa con il Rito di Canonizzazione dei Beati: Vincenzo Grossi, Maria dell’Immacolata Concezione, Ludovico Martin e Maria Azelia Guérin|language=Italian|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
In 2011, the letters of Zélie and Louis Martin were published in English as ''A Call to a Deeper Love: The Family Correspondence of the Parents of Saint Therese of the Child Jesus, 1863–1885'' ({{ISBN|0818913215}}). Although only 16 letters from Louis survive, many of Zélie's 216 letters give vivid details about the family's life and Louis's character as a father.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

'''Massimo Mazzucco''' (born 20 July 1954 in [[Turin]]) is an Italian filmmaker who is known for producing documentary films such as ''The New American Century'' and ''Cancer -The Forbidden Cures''.  Mazzucco is also the editor of luogocomune.net{{irrelevant citation|date=February 2013|reason=Luogocomune.net is just a mere on-line discussion board about quackery and conspiracy theories, so the title "editor", in the sense of "a newspaper's Editor in Chef", doesn't make sense at all; it's just plain irrelevant, self-advertising and misleading as there are not newspapers, magazines or academic journals involved}}, an Italian news site concentrating mostly on the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 WTC attacks]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Criticism ==
Some criticism was directed to Mazzucco after his decision, starting September 2008, to publicize an alternative cancer therapy based on [[Sodium bicarbonate]] and proposed by Italian ex-doctor [[Tullio Simoncini]]. Said therapy is currently unproven, and Simoncini was expelled from the Italian Medical Association after he was tried and found guilty of fraud and manslaughter, since a patient died, allegedly as result of Simoncini's treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/news/article.php?storyid=2803 Tullio Simoncini: Renaissance Man]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/news/article.php?storyid=2805 |title=La 'grande eresia' di Tullio Simoncini |trans-title=The 'great heresy' of Tullio Simoncini |last=Mazzucco |first=Massimo |date=2008-09-04 |work=Luogo comune |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3026 |title=Cura il cancro per e-mail |trans-title=Cancer Care by email |language=Italian |last=Mazzucco |first=Massimo |work=Luogo comune |date=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lavinia |first=Gianvito |newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]] |location=Milan |title=Medico condannato: omicidio colposo |trans-title=Doctor convicted: manslaughter |date=21 May 2006 |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2006/maggio/21/Medico_condannato_omicidio_colposo_co_10_060521029.shtml |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Cambias''' is a fictional character in the [[United States|American]] daytime drama ''[[All My Children]]''. He was portrayed by actor [[William deVry]], from January 23, 2003 to August 29, 2003, and as ghostly visions from September 23 to 26, 2003; October 9, 2003; November 11 and 13, 2003; December 3, 2003; January 16 to 23, 2004; February 16, 20, and 26, 2004; September 7, 14, and 15, 2004; and January 27 to 31, 2006.

The character is one that lives in infamy due to the controversial [[rape]] storyline of ''All My Children'' heroine [[Bianca Montgomery]]. The event became one of the most debated topics within the soap opera medium and was nicknamed "[[Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]," a title first coined by ''[[Television Without Pity]]'' message board members to mean "the storyline that shall not be named."&lt;ref name="Afterellen.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah |last=Warn |title=The Debate Over Bianca's Rape on All My Children |publisher=[[AfterEllen.com]] |date=June 2003 |accessdate=2007-12-23 |url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/TV/amc-rape.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709082516/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/TV/amc-rape.html |archivedate=2007-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storyline==
Character Michael Cambias is primarily remembered for raping [[Erica Kane]]'s [[lesbian]] daughter, [[Bianca Montgomery]]. His background shows him to be the spoiled, wealthy, and extremely arrogant son of '''Alexander Cambias, Sr'''. (later known as the '''Satin Slayer'''). He comes to Pine Valley with business partner [[Lena Kundera and Bianca Montgomery|Lena Kundera]] in a failed attempt to take over several prominent Pine Valley businesses, including Chandler Enterprises, Cortlandt Enterprises, Enchantment and Fusion Cosmetics.

On a gloomy, rainy and thunderous night when the power is out in all houses of Pine Valley, Michael breaks into the boarding house Bianca resides at and rapes her to get back at Kendall and Erica for ruining his plans. Michael is later charged with raping Bianca, but to the community's utter disgust, he is acquitted due to a lack of physical evidence (an angry Lena even goes so far as to almost attack him after the acquittal). His after-trial gloating, wherein he states that he ''"owns Pine Valley, and everybody in it'',''"'' angers nearly everyone in hearing range and Jackson Montgomery, Bianca's uncle, warns Cambias's attorney to get him out of the courtroom, before the crowd becomes a [[Lynching|lynch mob]]. Eventually, he is found dead in a freezer outside of Pine Valley.

His funeral is attended by most everyone who cares for Bianca, and their "eulogies" are laced with anger and hatred toward him. Lena even goes so far as to spit on his grave. His final resting place, fittingly enough, is in the city dump; [[Tad Martin (All My Children)|Tad Martin]] had earlier stolen Michael's body from the funeral home and filled the empty casket with rocks before throwing the body in the garbage.

Though Kendall is initially the prime suspect in the murder, it is later revealed to be Bianca. Bianca had earlier confronted Michael and shot him to death in self-defense when he attempted to rape her again, but she repressed her memories of the event. When she recalls killing Michael and confesses, the judge who believed Bianca's story all along, leans hard on the prosecution not to file any charges against her.

Eventually, it was discovered that when Bianca was raped, he impregnated her. She eventually gave birth to a daughter, named [[Miranda Montgomery|Miranda]]. Although Michael is her father, Bianca gave Miranda the last name Montgomery.

==Specific character detail ==
Character Michael Cambias was born on May 25, 1969.
The writers had him die of a fatal injury sustained after a gunshot wound to the abdomen by Bianca Montgomery on August 28, 2003.

The '''Nacotchtank''' were a native [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian people]] who lived in the area of what is now [[Washington, D.C.]] during the 17th century. Their principal village (also named Nacotchtank) was situated within the modern borders of the District of Columbia, on the eastern bank of a small river that still bears an anglicised variant of their name &amp;mdash; the [[Anacostia River|Anacostia]].

The Nacotchtank seem to have been associated with the larger [[Piscataway (tribe)|Piscataway]], whose ''Tayac'' or grand chief ruled over a loose confederacy of area tribes. Another closely related tribe was the [[Doeg (tribe)|Doeg]], whose homeland was on what is now the [[Virginia]] side of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], in the area around [[Fairfax County, VA|Fairfax]], [[Prince William County, VA|Prince William]], and [[Stafford County, VA|Stafford]] counties. All of these groups are thought to have spoken the [[Piscataway language|Piscataway]] (or similar) variant of the [[Nanticoke language]].

==Encounters with the English==
The Nacotchtank were first recorded by [[Captain John Smith]], who visited their [[palisade]]d village in 1608, and found them friendly. He noted that their main village had 80 fighting men, with a total population of about 300. It was an important trading center; tribes as distant as the [[Iroquois]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] would come to trade [[beaver]] pelts. The name ''Nacotchtank'', existing in several historical variants including '''Nacostine''', '''Anacostine''', '''Anaquashtank''', '''Nacothtant''',  '''Nachatanke''' etc.,  is said to mean "Trading village".

In 1622, Captain [[Henry Fleet]] took a party of English, together with their [[Patawomeck]] allies, to attack the rival Nacotchtank, killing 18 and burning their village. After the Nacotchtank took Fleet captive the following year, they held him for 5 years, during which time he learned their language. After escaping in 1628, he returned to Nacotchtank in 1632 and obtained "800 weight" of pelts.

He was told the Nacotchtank enjoyed a [[monopoly]] among area tribes on [[fur trade]] with the Iroquois.  Fleet noted another of their villages called ''Tohoga'', roughly the site of modern [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]].  Two years later when the [[colony of Maryland]] was established, Fleet was still there as a trader, as related by the [[Jesuits]].

Around 1668, greatly depopulated from [[Eurasia]]n [[infectious diseases]] [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to the English, to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], the Nacotchtank relocated to [[Theodore Roosevelt Island|Anacostine Island]] (present-day Theodore Roosevelt Island.)  Remnants and descendants likely merged with the Piscataway.

'''Oliver Friggieri''' (born 27 March 1947) is a Maltese [[poet]], [[novelist]], [[literary critic]], and minor [[philosopher]]. In philosophy he is mostly interested in [[epistemology]] and [[Existentialism]].&lt;ref name="Montebello_2001"&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Vol. 1, p. 184}}&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''20th Century Philosophy in Malta'', Agius &amp; Agius, Malta, 2009, pp. 126-128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Malta’s Philosophy &amp; Philosophers'', PIN Publications, Malta, 2011, pp. 152-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Friggieri was born in [[Floriana]], [[Malta]], in 1947. He studied at the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta|bishop's]] seminary, and then at the [[University of Malta]]. From here he acquired a Bachelor of Arts in [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Italian Language|Italian]] and [[Philosophy]] (1968), and then a [[Master’s degree|Masters]] (1975). In 1978 he acquired a Doctorate in [[Maltese Literature]] and [[Literary Criticism]] from the [[Catholic University of Milan]], [[Italy]].

Friggieri began his teaching career in 1968 by teaching [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[Philosophy]] in secondary schools. Then, in 1976, he moved on teaching [[Maltese language|Maltese]] at the [[University of Malta]], first as Assistant Lecturer, then as Lecturer (1978), and later as Associate Lecturer (1988). In 1988 he was chosen Head of the Department of [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. He became Professor in 1990.

In the meantime, between 1970 and 1971 Friggieri was very active in [[Malta]]’s Literary Revival Movement (''Moviment Qawmien Letterarju''). He was on the editorial board of ''Il-Polz'' (1969–73), a Maltese literary periodical, of which he became editor (1974–75). He co-founded ''Is-Saghtar'' (1971), a children’s literary and cultural magazine, and remained on its editorial board ever since. In 1971 he also collaborated in the establishment of a publishing house, ''Klabb Kotba Maltin'' (Maltese Book Club), which facilitated the publishing of books in [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. He has been the editor of the ''Journal of Maltese Studies'' since 1980. He is also a Member of the Association Internationale des Critiques Litteraires of [[Paris]], [[France]].

In 2008 Friggieri published his autobiography, '''''Fjuri li ma Jinxfux''''' (Flowers Which Never Wither), relevant to the years 1955–90 of his life.

==Works==
Friggieri is the author of innumerable books. Since his main specialisation is [[literature]], and particularly [[Maltese Literature]], most of his publications are not of a directly philosophical nature. These include dictionaries of literature, oratories, [[cantatas]], [[literary criticism]], [[Biography in literature|literary biographies]], and anthologies of his own [[poetry]]. Particular mention should be given to [[Malta]]’s national poet, [[Dun Karm Psaila]], of whom Friggieri is an uncontested expert. Friggieri also significantly contributed essays on [[Peter Caxaro]] and [[Michael Anthony Vassalli]].

Apart from the frequent contributions in local periodicals and newspapers, of especial interest to philosophy are Friggieri’s novels and short stories. Generally speaking, these are imbued with [[pathos]] and profuse with philosophical reflections. Namely, they are the following:

'''Short stories'''
:* 1986 - '''''Stejjer Għal Qabel Jidlam''''' (Stories Before The Darkness).
:* 1991 - '''''Fil-Gżira Taparsi Jikbru l-Fjuri''''' (On The Island Where Flowers Pretend To Grow).
'''Novels'''
:* 1977 - '''''Il-Gidba''''' (The Lie).&lt;ref name="Montebello_2001"/&gt;{{rp|204}}
:* 1980 - '''''L-Istramb''''' (The Odd Fellow).&lt;ref name="Montebello_2001"/&gt;{{rp|263–264}}
:* 1986 - '''''Fil-Parlament ma Jikbrux Fjuri''''' (No Flowers Grow in Parliament).&lt;ref name="Montebello_2001"/&gt;{{rp|Vol. II, p. 80}}

His book ''[[Spycatcher]]'', written with [[Paul Greengrass]], became an international bestseller with sales of over two million copies. ''Spycatcher'' was part memoir, part exposé of what Wright claimed were serious institutional failings in MI5 and his subsequent investigations into those. He is said to have been influenced in his [[counter-intelligence|counterespionage]] activity by [[James Jesus Angleton]], the [[US]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) counterintelligence chief from 1954 to 1975.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

==Education==
Wright was educated at [[Bishop's Stortford College]], a boarding [[independent school]] for boys in the [[market town]] of [[Bishop's Stortford]] in [[Hertfordshire]], followed by [[St Peter's College, Oxford|St Peter's College]] at the [[University of Oxford]].

==Father's footsteps==
[[File:Bugged-great-seal-open.jpg|thumbnail|280px|Replica of the Great Seal which contained "[[Thing (listening device)|The Thing]]" a Soviet bugging device, on display at the NSA's [[National Cryptologic Museum]].]]
Peter Wright was born in 26 Cromwell Road, [[Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire]], the son of (George) Maurice Wright, who was the [[Marconi Company]]'s director of research, and one of the founders of [[signals intelligence]] during World War I.

During [[World War II|the Second World War]], Wright worked at the [[Admiralty]]'s Research Laboratory. In 1946, he began work as a Principal Scientific Officer at the Services Electronics Research Laboratory.

According to his own account, his work for the UK intelligence, initially part-time, started in the spring of 1949 when he was given a job of a Navy Scientist attached to the Marconi Company. According to ''Spycatcher'', during his stint there, he was instrumental in resolving a difficult technical problem. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] sought Marconi's assistance over a [[covert listening device]] (or "bug") that had been found in a replica of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] presented to the United States ambassador in Moscow in 1945 by the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union]]. Wright determined that the bugging device, dubbed [[Thing (listening device)|The Thing]], was actually a tiny capacitive membrane (a [[Microphone#Condenser, capacitor or electrostatic microphones|condenser microphone]]) that became active only when 330 [[MHz]] microwaves were beamed to it from a remote transmitter. A remote receiver could then have been used to decode the modulated microwave signal and permit sounds picked up by the microphone to be heard. The device was eventually attributed to Soviet inventor, [[Léon Theremin]].

==Intelligence career highlights==
In 1954, Wright was recruited as principal scientific officer for [[MI5]]. According to his memoirs, he then was either responsible for, or intimately involved with, the development of some of the basic techniques of [[ELINT]], for example:

* Operation ENGULF (MI5): [[acoustic cryptanalysis]]—recording the sound of the settings of Egyptian [[Boris Hagelin|Hagelin]] cipher machines in 1956.
* [[Operation RAFTER]] (MI5): remote detection of passive radio receivers used by Soviet illegals through detecting emanations from the local oscillator, in 1958 (a technique now more commonly used to enforce payment of [[television licence]]s). The program eventually expanded into airborne operations, where receivers were detected from transport planes, thus giving the general area where mobile ground detection could be initiated. This was done by flooding the vicinity with vans that at best could pinpoint buildings or blocks. However, the method was less successful against mobile receivers.
* Operation STOCKADE (MI5/GCHQ): analysis of [[TEMPEST|compromising emanation]] from French cipher machine cables in 1960. They used broad band radio detection of the cables, and were actually able to read the original plain text along the low-grade cipher sequence. Surprisingly, murmurs of high-grade ciphers could sometimes be read from the same cable, which after comparison to the cable fed signal, gave a path to even that cipher's plain text leakage. From 1960 to 1963 the MI5 and GCHQ could read cipher traffic to and from the French Embassy in London.

Wright worked as the first chairman of the new ROC—Radio Operations Committee—formed in 1960. The technical staffs from the earlier separate and competitive British intelligence organizations finally began to combine their efforts, thus allowing the methods used in ENGULF and RAFTER to be expanded into domestic and foreign intelligence operations that would last into the late 1960s. According to Wright, MI5, MI6, and GCHQ had not functioned together or/and shared information as effectively since the war.

In 1964 he became chairman of a joint MI5/[[MI6]] committee, codenamed FLUENCY Working Party, appointed to find the traitor and investigate the whole history of Soviet penetration of Britain. Also from 1964, for the next six years he had regular interviews with [[Anthony Blunt]], a member of the [[Cambridge Five]], trying to glean more information from him about other Soviet spies.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wright. ''Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer'', 1987, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims about Roger Hollis, the Wilson Plot et al.==
{{see also|Harold Wilson conspiracy theories}}
While in MI5, Wright came to be aware that the [[USSR]]'s [[:Category:Soviet intelligence agencies|espionage agencies]] had been infiltrating the UK's government, military and education establishments from the 1930s by using, among other things, close-knit [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[homosexual]] circles at [[Oxbridge]], especially the [[Cambridge Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wright. ''Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer'', 1987, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; With like-minded MI5 officers, Wright became alert to the fact that some senior figures in the intelligence services, in politics, and in the trade unions were recruited Soviet agents.

After the Soviet spy [[Kim Philby]]'s defection in 1963 following what Wright refers to as a tip-off by "a fifth man, still inside",&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wright. ''Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer'', 1987, p. 174, 194-195.&lt;/ref&gt; he became convinced that the KGB had penetrated the higher reaches of MI5. As claimed in ''Spycatcher'', Wright had come to believe that [[Roger Hollis]] was the highest traitor in MI5. Wright went so far as to begin to make, as he himself put it, "his own 'freelance' inquiries into Hollis' background" shortly before the latter's retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wright. ''Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer'', 1987, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wright, his initial, unspecified, suspicion was aroused by his analysis of how a Soviet 'illegal' [[Konon Molody|Lonsdale]]'s arrest in January 1961 was handled by the KGB which appeared to have had advance knowledge thereof; Wright deduced that Lonsdale could have been sacrificed to protect a more important Soviet spy in Britain.&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-peter-wright-1617351.html Obituary: Peter Wright] [[The Independent]], 28 April 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright's suspicions were further strengthened by Hollis' apparent obstruction of any attempt to investigate information from several defectors that there was a mole in MI5, but he then discovered that Hollis had concealed relationships with a number of suspicious persons, including:
* a longstanding friendship with [[Claud Cockburn]], a [[communism|communist]] journalist who was at the time suspected of ties to Soviet intelligence; and,
* an acquaintance with [[Agnes Smedley]] whilst Hollis was in Shanghai, at a time when Smedley was in a relationship with [[Richard Sorge]], a proven Soviet [[spymaster]].

Later during his investigations, Wright looked into the debriefings of a Soviet [[defection|defector]] [[Igor Gouzenko]], and found to his surprise that the revelations of that debriefing were not reported or recorded. After a lengthy check, he discovered that it had been Hollis who was sent to Canada to interview Gouzenko. Gouzenko had provided Hollis with clear information about [[Alan Nunn May]]'s meetings with his handlers. Gouzenko also noted that the man who met him seemed to be in disguise, not interested in his revelations and discouraged him from further disclosures.

Gouzenko had not known about [[Klaus Fuchs]], but he had named a low level suspected [[GRU]] agent, [[Israel Halperin]], a [[mathematician]], who was later completely cleared. When the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] searched Halperin's lodgings, they found Fuchs' name in his address book. Fuchs immediately broke off contact with his handler, [[Harry Gold]], and shortly afterward took a long vacation to Mexico. Wright alleges in ''Spycatcher'' that Gouzenko himself deduced later that his interviewer might have been a Soviet [[double agent]] and was probably afraid that he might recognise him from case photos that Gouzenko might have seen in [[KGB]] or GRU files, which would explain why Hollis was disguised.

According to Wright, the FLUENCY Working Party, an interagency committee set up to examine all the hitherto unsolved allegations about penetration of the UK's security apparatus, unanimously concluded, among other things, that Hollis was the best fit for Gouzenko's "Elli" and [[Konstantin Volkov (diplomat)|Konstantin Volkov]]'s "Acting Head" allegations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wright. ''Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer'', 1987, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee chaired by Wright submitted its final findings shortly after Hollis retired in late 1965 as MI5 [[Director-General]], but investigation of Hollis was not sanctioned by his successor [[Martin Furnival Jones]], who nevertheless sanctioned the investigation of his deputy, [[Michael Hanley]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wright. ''Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer'', 1987, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; A retired civil servant, Burke Trend, later [[Lord Trend]], was brought in during the early 1970s to review the Hollis case. Trend studied the case for a year, and concluded that the evidence was inconclusive for either convicting or clearing Hollis; this was announced by Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in March 1981.

Peter Wright, on the basis of his interviews with Sir Dennis Proctor and his friends, also alleged in his book that Proctor, former Permanent Secretary at the UK [[Ministry of Power (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Power]], was at the very least, by Proctor's own account, an unwitting source of secret information to the Soviets via his close friend and Soviet spy [[Guy Burgess]], from whom he had kept no secrets which, in Proctor's opinion, obviated the necessity to recruit him.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wright. ''Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer'', 1987, p. 262-263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright's sights were also focused on [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[Harold Wilson]], suspicions about whom were initially triggered amongst the MI5 management shortly after his appointment as prime minister in 1964 by [[James Jesus Angleton]], Deputy Director of Operations for Counterintelligence at the CIA. The investigation into Wilson's background by MI5, however, failed to produce any conclusive evidence.

When Wright retired in 1976, Harold Wilson was again prime minister. Dame [[Stella Rimington]], MI5 [[Director General of MI5|Director General]] from 1992 to 1996, who was in MI5 while Peter Wright was still working there, wrote in 2001 that she believed that in a Panorama programme in 1988, Peter Wright had retracted his allegation made in his book about the MI5 group of thirty officers who plotted to overthrow Wilson's government.&lt;ref name="Stella"&gt;Stella Rimington. [https://www.theguardian.com/freedom/Story/0,,549895,00.html Spies like us] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 Sept 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; She also criticised Wright who, according to her, by the time she knew him well was "a man with an obsession, and was regarded by many as quite mad and certainly dangerous"; she alleged that he was a disruptive and lazy officer, who as special advisor to the Director had a habit of taking case files that interested him from other officers, failing to return them to their proper place and failing to write up any interviews he conducted.&lt;ref name="Stella"/&gt;

The case made by Wright against Roger Hollis was brought up to date by [[Chapman Pincher]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1203581/Chapman-Pincher-devoted-life-exposing-traitors-identifies-KGB-agent-says-heart-British-Intelligence.html Chapman Pincher, who has devoted his life to exposing traitors, identifies the KGB agent he says was at the heart of British Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/01/ian-jack-chapman-pincher-fleet-street Chapman Pincher was Fleet Street's spycatcher. His secret? A good lunch] [[The Guardian]], 1 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''Treachery: Betrayals, Blunders, and Cover-ups: Six Decades of Espionage Against America and Great Britain'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;''Treachery: Betrayals, Blunders, and Cover-ups: Six Decades of Espionage Against America and Great Britain''. New York: Random House. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-6807-4}}. Revised edition published 2011, in the UK by Mainstream. {{ISBN|978-1-84596-769-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and legacy==

Because of the interest in Wright's activities and because of a dispute regarding his pension, in 1985, Wright decided to publish his memoirs, ''Spycatcher'', in Australia in order to make ends meet. The British government did all it could to suppress publication, arguing that such a publication would be in violation of the [[Official Secrets Act]]. They brought an injunction against Wright in Sydney. The Australian court, however, ruled against the British government.  Wright was represented in court by [[Malcolm Turnbull]], (later Prime Minister of Australia).

During the trial a witness, [[Robert Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Ilminster|Sir Robert Armstrong]], used the phrase "[[Economical with the truth]]" in response to Wright's  claim that he was telling the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/127700.html|title=Economical with the truth - meaning and origin.|last=reserved.|first=Phrase Finder is copyright Gary Martin, 1996-2016. All rights|website=www.phrases.org.uk|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With trans-Atlantic repercussions, ''Spycatcher'' first revealed the details and name of the [[Venona project]], a cryptographic collaboration between the UK and US that had succeeded in deciphering more than 2000 messages from Soviet agents in the two countries and elsewhere. Wright's revelations led to the public release of the Venona messages in 1995. The released texts incriminated a number of public figures who had previously been defended as victims of [[McCarthyism]] by left-wing historians, causing considerable reassessment of the period of the second [[Red Scare]] (1947-1957).

The publication of ''Spycatcher'' temporarily unlocked the doors of official secrecy as far as former intelligence officers were concerned. With the enactment of the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]], an absolute prohibition on revelations by serving or former intelligence officers was imposed.

''Spycatcher'' became a best-seller. Wright went on to publish ''The Encyclopaedia of Espionage'' in 1991, which had little impact. By this stage of his life he had become increasingly reclusive, suffering from [[diabetes]] and heart trouble. A year before his death in [[Tasmania]] on 27 April 1995 aged 78, he was diagnosed as having [[Alzheimer's disease]].

'''Qiu Huizuo''' ({{zh|s=邱会作|w='''''Ch'iu Hui-tso'''''}}; April 16, 1914 – July 18, 2002) was a [[lieutenant general]] of the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), best known as one of the "four guardian warriors" of Vice Chairman [[Lin Biao]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Guo2015"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Guo Jian |author2=Yongyi Song |author3=Yuan Zhou |title=Historical Dictionary of the Chinese Cultural Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9NQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA264 |year=2015 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |isbn=978-1-4422-5172-4 |page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qiu rose through the ranks of the PLA during the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] between the Communists and the [[Kuomintang]].  He took charge as the PLA logistics chief in 1959, and was persecuted at the beginning of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. He was later rehabilitated owing to the blessing of [[Zhou Enlai]] and Lin Biao, and elevated to the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] in 1969. In return, he helped to persecute Lin's enemies and consolidate Lin's power in the PLA. After Lin's flight and death in 1971, Qiu was purged and sentenced to 16 years in prison.

==Revolutionary years==
Qiu was born in [[Xingguo County]], [[Jiangxi]] Province on April 16, 1914. He was schooled in a local ''sishu'' (private school specializing in education in Chinese classics).&lt;ref name=huiyi&gt;{{cite web |script-title=zh:周恩来不是人民的总理，而是毛氏的家臣 ——从《邱会作回忆录》看周恩来在中共政权中的作用 |author=Yu Jie |publisher=Radio Free Asia |url=http://www.rfa.org/mandarin/zhuanlan/wenyitiandi-cite/yj-08162012162443.html |date=August 16, 2012 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the militia forces in his home county in 1929 at the age of fifteen. He joined the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1932. In 1934–35, he took part in the [[Long March]]. According to Qiu's autobiography, shortly before the Communists' forced exodus from their base in [[Jiangxi]], he was almost executed by party intelligence officials who thought he possessed too much sensitive information regarding military logistics. However, on the way to his execution, he ran into [[Zhou Enlai]], who spared his life and put him under the wing of the logistics head [[Ye Jizhuang]].&lt;ref name=huiyi/&gt; By the time the Communist forces arrived in northern Shaanxi, Qiu was tasked with logistical work, ensuring that the army had sufficient supplies.&lt;ref name=huiyi/&gt;&lt;!-- After the [[New Fourth Army incident]] of 1941 which ended the Kuomintang-Communist alliance, Qiu was transferred to the third division of the [[New Fourth Army]]. Source? --&gt;

After the [[Chinese Civil War]] resumed between the Communists and Kuomintang in 1945, Qiu served in [[Manchuria]] as [[political commissar]] of the Eighth Column of Lin Biao's [[Fourth Field Army]]. Qiu, being a relatively junior officer, was not particularly close to Lin Biao at the time. He did not meet Lin in person until 1948, when Lin put him in charge of logistics of the Fourth Field Army. Qiu did work closely with [[Huang Yongsheng]], who was commander of the Eighth Column. They participated in the [[Liaoshen Campaign]], [[Pingjin Campaign]], and the [[Hengbao Campaign]].&lt;ref name=sina&gt;{{cite web |url=http://book.sina.com.cn/excerpt/sz/rw/2011-01-24/1233282665.shtml |script-title=zh:林彪后勤部长花花太岁邱会作浮沉录 |author=Gu Baozi |work=Sina |date=24 January 2011 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early People's Republic==
After the Communists won the Civil War and established the People's Republic of China, Qiu was appointed Director of the Political Department of the [[Guangzhou Military Region|South China Military Region]], serving under commander [[Ye Jianying]] and deputy commander Huang Yongsheng.&lt;ref name=sina/&gt;

In 1955, Qiu was appointed deputy director and political commissar of the [[PLA General Logistics Department]] (GLD), working under director [[Hong Xuezhi]]. He also attained the rank of [[lieutenant general]], when the PLA awarded military ranks for the first time in 1955. At the [[Lushan Conference]] in 1959, Defence Minister [[Peng Dehuai]] was purged for criticizing [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Great Leap Forward]] and replaced by Lin Biao. Hong Xuezhi was also dismissed for following Peng's lead, and Qiu was named head of the GLD.&lt;ref name=sina/&gt;

==Cultural Revolution==
When the [[Cultural Revolution]] began in 1966, Qiu was labelled a counter-revolutionary element and targeted by the rebels in the GLD. He was subject to physical abuse and torture, fainting many times.&lt;ref name=huiyi/&gt; Qiu appealed directly to [[Lin Biao]] for help, who arranged his dramatic rescue. In the early hours of 25 January 1967, Lin's men took him from the GLD compound and moved him to a safe location in the [[Western Hills]]. Qiu called the day his "rebirth".&lt;ref name="Guo2015"/&gt;

After Qiu's release, marshals [[Liu Bocheng]], [[Nie Rongzhen]] and [[Ye Jianying]] visited Qiu as he was undergoing treatment. The senseless mistreatment of Qiu was one of a series of events that pushed marshals Nie and Ye to voice their displeasure with the Cultural Revolution during the [[February Countercurrent]], the last serious phase of dissent in the senior ranks of the party during the movement. Zhou Enlai himself asked Qiu to be restored in his leadership position in the GLD. On Qiu, Zhou commented, "the logistics department is like a smaller [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], comrade Qiu has helped me with many things."&lt;ref name=huiyi/&gt;

In May 1967, Lin Biao appointed Qiu, together with [[Li Zuopeng]] and [[Wu Faxian]], leaders of the "proletarian revolutionaries of the armed forces." In return, Qiu helped to persecute Lin's enemies and consolidate Lin's power in the PLA. He authorized the torture of 462 people in the GLD, eight of whom died as a result,&lt;ref name="Guo2015"/&gt; including lieutenant generals [[Fu Lianzhang]] and [[Tang Ping]].&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite web |script-title=zh:邱会作浮沉录 |author=Xia Fei |url=http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/68742/69118/69658/5459511.html |work=People's Daily |date=March 12, 2007 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attacked General [[Xiao Hua (general)|Xiao Hua]], director of the [[PLA General Political Department]] (GPD), and wreaked havoc in the GPD.&lt;ref name="Guo2015"/&gt;

At the [[9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China]] in 1969, Qiu and many other PLA generals emerged as the main beneficiaries of the Cultural Revolution after the destruction of the old guard. Qiu was elevated to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Central Committee]] as well as the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]].&lt;ref name="Guo2015"/&gt; Qiu's political fortunes, however, were short-lived. When Lin Biao fled the country in September 1971 in an event still shrouded in mystery, Qiu was implicated by association.&lt;ref name=qiuh&gt;{{cite news |script-title=zh:林彪大将邱会作的晚年生活 2002年病逝 |url=http://news.ifeng.com/history/1/renwu/200901/0104_2665_951622.shtml |work=Phoenix News |date=January 4, 2009 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was relieved of his duties on September 24, 1971, then sent to confinement in a military base in [[Shunyi]] while the authorities sorted out the consequences of the incident. Qiu was then expelled from the party in 1973.&lt;ref name=qiuh/&gt;

==Trial, prison, and release==
Qiu was considered one of the main culprits of the so-called "Lin Biao-Jiang Qing Counter-revolutionary clique" and went on trial along with the [[Gang of Four]] in 1981.  Of Lin Biao's inner circle, Qiu was said to have a good attitude during the proceedings, openly confessing to the charges and kneeling in front of Lt. Gen. Tang Ping's widow to seek her forgiveness.&lt;ref name=people/&gt; On January 25, 1981, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison (including time served since 1971).&lt;ref name=qiuh/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guo2015"/&gt; He was released in 1987 after serving his full sentence, and resettled in [[Xi'an]] where he reunited with his family and was afforded some basic benefits from the state as well as a living stipend of about 200 yuan a month. As his health worsened in 2001, he was sent to [[Peking Union Medical College Hospital]] for treatment, and died there in 2002.&lt;ref name=qiuh/&gt;

==Autobiography==
Qiu wrote an autobiography, released in Hong Kong in 2012, which includes details on the intrigues of the Cultural Revolution and his relationship with Lin Biao. In it, Qiu portrays himself as a bulwark against the political machinations and ambitions of [[Jiang Qing]].&lt;ref name=huiyi/&gt;

'''Ras Thavas''' is a [[fictional]] [[Character (arts)|character]] created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] in his 1927 novel ''[[The Master Mind of Mars]]''. Within the narrative framework of the story he is an elderly [[Martian]] [[mad scientist]] of the city-state of Toonol, the "Master Mind" of the novel's title, skilled in the surgical transplantation of brains. He takes in protagonist [[Ulysses Paxton]], an earthman newly arrived on the planet, and educates him in the ways of [[Barsoom]], as Mars is known to its inhabitants.

Ras has perfected techniques of brain transplantation, which he uses to provide rich elderly Martians with youthful new bodies for a profit. Distrustful of his fellow Martians, he trains Paxton as his assistant to perform the same operation on him. But Paxton has fallen in love with Valla Dia, one of Ras' young victims, whose body has been swapped for that of the hag Xaxa, Jeddara (empress) of the city-state of Phundahl. He refuses to operate on Ras until his mentor promises to restore her to her rightful body. Ras agrees, and receives his operation. Now distrustful of his protege, the scientist plots to murder him, but Paxton escapes in the company of other experimental victims of the master mind and proceeds to Phundahl on his quest to retrieve Valla Dia's original body. Ras warns Xaxa against Paxton, but the group ultimately succeeds in kidnapping the Jeddara and reversing the brain exchange. Later Ras travels to Phundahl for aid in recovering his island laboratory, from which he has been expelled by soldiers from Toonol. He finds Xaxa overthrown and Paxton's ally Dar Tarus the new Jeddak. Tarus agrees to oust the Toonolians on the condition that Ras reform and cease trafficking in bodies.

==Further Appearances==
Ras later resurfaces in the later novel ''[[Synthetic Men of Mars]]'' (1939), by which time he has transferred his base to the dead city of Morbus in the Toonolian Marshes. There he has been experimenting in growing monstrous synthetic human beings called hormads. The most intelligent of these turn on him and force him to grow an army of hormads with which to conquer Barsoom. They also force their captive to transplant their brains into the bodies of imprisoned normal Martians. Ras's chance to turn the tables comes when the earthman [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], Warlord of Mars and prince of Helium, seeks his surgical aid for his wife [[Dejah Thoris]], injured in an accident. Imprisoned with Ras, Carter and his companion Vor Daj plot with him against the hormads. Vor Daj is given the body of a hormad to spy on their captors; meanwhile, Carter and Ras escape, returning with a great fleet of airships from Helium. Vor Daj is recovered and Morbus, which has been overrun by a huge mass of cancerously growing hormad flesh, is destroyed with incendiary bombs. Ras then restores Vor Daj to his original body.

One hormad, Ras's pupil Pew Mogel, is later revealed in "[[John Carter and the Giant of Mars]]" (1940) to have escaped from Morbus and established a new base in the dead city of Korvas, from which he continues to plot world conquest using the scientific skills he gleaned from his mentor. His scheme is defeated by John Carter.

Ras Thavas also appears in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s [[Harold Shea]] story "[[Sir Harold of Zodanga]]" (1995), in which he agrees to guide the world-hopping Harold Shea and his wife Belphebe on their quest to recover their kidnapped daughter Voglinda.  As payment he seeks professional help from psychologist Shea; since Paxton transplanted his brain from his original aged body into his present young and virile one, he has had difficulty adjusting to changed societal expectations, not to mention the youthful urges of his new form. Over the course of their Barsoomian journey Shea counsels the irascible genius successfully. In turn, Ras helps Shea win a duel with an assassin by employing his superior mental powers to make the hired killer believe he is confronting six Harolds rather than one. He also uses his medical skills to save the life of their enemy Malambroso, who has been wounded by Belphebe.

Farook had a profile on the [[online dating|dating website]] iMilap.com, in which he listed backyard [[target practice]] as a hobby. A lawyer for Farook's family also said that he would go to [[firing range]]s by himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who were Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/03/us/syed-farook-tashfeen-malik-mass-shooting-profile/|publisher=CNN|date=December 3, 2015|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farook worked as a [[food safety|food inspector]] for the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health for five years before the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Bernardino Shooting: Two Suspects Dead After Gun Battle|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/active-shooter-reported-in-southern-california-1449085770|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=San Bernardino shooting live updates: Syed Farook named as a suspect in attack that killed 14|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-bernardino-shooting-live-updates-htmlstory.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNwhatweknow" /&gt; From July to December 2010, he was a seasonal employee for the county.

====Religious views and travels====
According to family members and coworkers, Farook was a devout [[Sunni Muslim]], and traveled to Saudi Arabia several times, including to complete the [[hajj]]&lt;!--Do not capitalize; it's a common noun rather than a proper noun--&gt; in 2013.&lt;ref name="CluesMotive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNRadicalized"/&gt; Farook attended prayers at the [[Islamic Center of Riverside]] twice a day, in the mornings and the evenings, according to an interview in ''[[The New York Times]]'' with Mustafa H. Kuko, the Center's director. According to the ''Times'', Farook stood out as especially devout and "kept a bit of a distance" from other congregants.&lt;ref name=Nagourney&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nagourney|first1=Adam|title=Couple Kept Tight Lid on Plans for San Bernardino Shooting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/us/san-bernardino-shooting-syed-rizwan-farook.html|accessdate=December 4, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, according to friends, he never discussed politics. Farook abruptly stopped going to the mosque in 2014 following his marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Dexter|title=San Bernardino shooting suspect stopped attending mosque two years ago|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-bernardino-shooting-suspect-serious-about-studying-the-koran-20151203-story.html|accessdate=December 13, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' reported that Farook's father said that his son "shared the ideology of [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi|Al Baghdadi]] to create an Islamic state" and that he was fixated with [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-bernardino-suspect-was-obsessed-with-israel-father-says/ |title=San Bernardino suspect was obsessed with Israel, father says|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) later claimed the father did not recall making these statements about his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Bernardino attacker was 'normal guy' while practicing at shooting range|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-bernardino-shootings-fbi-raid-20151207-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Studies in Multan ====
Malik returned to Pakistan to study [[pharmacology]] at [[Bahauddin Zakariya University]] in [[Multan]], beginning the program in 2007 and graduating in 2012.&lt;ref name="inspired"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/12/04/suspects-family-shocked-killings/76773382/|title=FBI: No evidence San Bernardino killers were part of a cell|work=USA Today|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AttendedIslamicInstitute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Al-Huda"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Salman |last1=Masood |first2=Declan |last2=Walsh|title=Tashfeen Malik Attended Conservative Religious School in Pakistan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/world/asia/tashfeen-malik-attended-conservative-religious-school-in-pakistan.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Interior (Saudi Arabia)|Saudi Interior Ministry]] spokesman Major General Mansour Al-Turki denied reports that Malik grew up in his country, saying that she only visited Saudi Arabia for a few weeks in 2008 and again in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aunt: San Bernardino suspect 'became more devout'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/12/06/san-bernardino-shooting/76879058/|work=USA Today|date=December 6, 2015|accessdate=December 11, 2015|first=Jane|last=Onyanga-Omara|first2=John|last2=Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Multan has been linked to [[Jihadism|jihadist]] activity.&lt;ref name="USATodaySchool"&gt;{{cite web|title=Female San Bernardino suspect went to religious school|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/12/07/san-bernardino-suspect-religious-shool/76911152/|work=USA Today|date=December 7, 2015|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Multan, Malik attended the local center of the [[Al-Huda Institute|Al-Huda International Seminary]], a women-only [[madrassa|religious academy]] network with seminaries across Pakistan and branches in the U.S. and Canada that was founded in 1994.&lt;ref name="NYT Al-Huda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USATodaySchool" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimCraig"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Craig|first1=Tim|title=Pakistan is focus in hunt|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/pakistan-is-focus-in-hunt-for-clues-to-california-shooters-radical-turn/2015/12/09/aaec9a14-9ad3-11e5-aca6-1ae3be6f06d2_story.html|accessdate=December 11, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is aligned with the [[Wahhabi]] form of Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name="TimCraig" /&gt; According to school records, Malik enrolled in an eighteen-month [[Quran]]ic studies course with Al-Huda on April 17, 2013, and left on May 3, 2014, telling administrators that she was leaving to get married. Malik expressed an interest in completing the [[Distance education|course by correspondence]], but never did so.&lt;ref name="NYT Al-Huda" /&gt;

According to experts, Al-Huda "draws much of its support from women from educated, relatively affluent backgrounds."&lt;ref name="NYT Al-Huda" /&gt; Faiza Mushtaq, a Pakistani scholar that studied the organization, said that "these Al-Huda classes is teaching these urban, educated, upper-middle-class women a very conservative interpretation of Islam that makes them very judgmental about others around them." According to the ''Los Angeles Times'', Al-Huda seminaries promote anti-Western views and hard-line practices in a fashion that "could encourage some adherents to lash out against non-believers."&lt;ref name=LATimes.Al-Huda&gt;{{cite web |first1=Aoun |last1=Sahi |first2=Shashank |last2=Bengali |title=School that taught San Bernardino assailant is known for anti-Western, fundamentalist views |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-school-san-bernardino-fundamentalist-20151207-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' reported that the institute "teaches a strict literalist interpretation of the Quran, although it does not advocate violent jihad."&lt;ref name="MissedSocialMedia"&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Apuzzo|first2=Michael S.|last2=Schmidt|first3=Julia|last3=Preston|title=U.S. Visa Process Missed San Bernardino Wife's Zealotry on Social Media|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/us/san-bernardino-attacks-us-visa-process-tashfeen-maliks-remarks-on-social-media-about-jihad-were-missed.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Al-Huda administrator from the head office in Islamabad said that terrorism "is against the teachings of Islam" and that the school's curriculum did not endorse violence.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Al-Huda /&gt;

==== Marriage and entry into United States ====
According to one of Farook's coworkers, Malik and her husband married about a month after he traveled to Saudi Arabia in early 2014; the two had met over the Internet.&lt;ref name="Suspects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATIMES-Americandream"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-syed-farook-had-traveled-to-saudi-arabia-married-appeared-to-live-american-dream-co-workers-say-20151202-story.html|title=San Bernardino shooting suspect traveled to Saudi Arabia, was married, appeared to be living 'American Dream,' co-workers say|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malik joined Farook in California shortly after their wedding.

On December 16, 2015, FBI Director James Comey said, "We can see from our investigation that in late 2013, before there is a physical meeting of these two people [Farook and Malik] resulting in their engagement and then journey to the United States, they are communicating online, showing signs in that communication of their joint commitment to jihadism and to martyrdom.

Early reports had erroneously stated that Malik had openly expressed jihadist beliefs on social media, leading to calls for U.S. immigration officials to routinely review social media as part of background checks, which is not part of the current procedure.&lt;ref name="MissedSocialMedia" /&gt; Comey subsequently clarified that the remarks were "direct private messages" that were not publicly accessible and that "So far, in this investigation, we have found no evidence of posting on social media."&lt;ref name="BakerSantora" /&gt;

Comey said that the FBI's investigation had revealed that Farook and Malik were "consuming poison on the Internet" and both had become radicalized "before they started courting or dating each other online" and "before the emergence of ISIL."&lt;ref name="BakerSantora" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Michael |last1=Martinez |first2=Catherine E. |last2=Shoichet |first3=Pamela |last3=Brown|title=San Bernardino shooting: Couple radicalized before they met, FBI says|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/09/us/san-bernardino-shooting/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Comey said that "untangling the motivations of which particular terrorist [[propaganda]] motivated in what way remains a challenge in these investigations, and our work is ongoing there."&lt;ref name="BakerSantora" /&gt;

== Planning of the attack ==
In [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] testimony given on December 9, 2015, FBI Director [[James B. Comey]] said that the FBI investigation has shown that Farook and Malik were "homegrown violent extremists" who were "inspired by [[foreign terrorist organization]]s." Comey also said that Farook and Malik "were talking to each other about [[jihad]] and martyrdom," before their engagement and as early as the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="WilliamsAbdullah"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Pete|last1=Williams|first2=Halimah|last2=Abdullah|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/fbi-san-bernardino-shooters-radicalized-they-met-n476971|title=FBI: San Bernardino Shooters Radicalized Before They Met|publisher=NBC News|date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo.jihad"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldman|first1=Adam|last2=Berman|first2=Mark|title=San Bernardino Attackers Talked 'About Jihad and Martyrdom' in 2013|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/12/09/san-bernardino-attackers-talked-about-jihad-and-martyrdom-in-2013|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reportedly spent at least a year preparing for the attack, including taking target practice and making plans to take care of their child and Farook's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Andrew|last1=Blankstein|first2=Robert|last2=Windrem|first3=Pete|last3=Williams|first4=Richard|last4=Esposito|first5=Hannah|last5=Rappleye|title=San Bernardino Shooters Practiced for Attack a Year in Advance|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/san-bernardino-shooters-planned-attack-least-year-advance-n476521|publisher=NBC News|date=December 8, 2015|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comey has said that although the investigation has shown that Farook and Malik were radicalized and possibly inspired by foreign terrorist organizations, there is no indication that the couple were directed by such a group or part of a broader [[terrorist cell|cell or network]].&lt;ref name="inspired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT.Comey"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISIL radio: Two supporters carried out San Bernardino massacre|first=Gregg|last=Zoroya|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/12/05/isil-radio-two-supporters-carried-out-san-bernardino-massacre/76828170|work=USA Today|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/12/04/suspects-family-shocked-killings/76773382|title=FBI: No evidence San Bernardino killers were part of a cell|date=December 4, 2015|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple altered the guns: there was a failed attempt to modify the Smith &amp; Wesson rifle to fire in [[Automatic rifle|fully automatic]] mode, they made a modification that defeated the ban on detachable [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]], and they used a detachable [[high-capacity magazine]]. California laws limit magazines to a maximum of ten rounds, and the magazine must be fixed by a recessed button mechanism to the rifle and require [[bullet button|a tool such as a bullet, pen, or other implement]] to remove it, thereby creating a delay in the rate at which spent magazines can be replaced.&lt;ref name="WSJWeapons" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-gun-laws-san-bernardino_56606dd8e4b079b2818d7034 |title=Why California's Strict Gun Laws Didn't Matter In San Bernardino | work=The Huffington Post|date=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], the modifications made the guns illegal [[assault weapon]]s.&lt;ref name="CluesMotive" /&gt; The couple also [[Jungle style (firearm magazines)|taped magazines together]] to make switching them out easier.

The explosive device left at the Inland Regional Center comprised three explosive devices connected to one another. It was contained inside the backpack left by Farook during the departmental event. The devices were described as [[pipe bomb]]s constructed with [[Christmas lights]] and tied together, combined with a [[remote controlled car]] that was switched on.

The chase ended in a suburban neighborhood about {{convert|1.7|mi|km}} away from the scene of the initial attack. There, Farook and Malik exchanged gunfire with officers.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt; The gunfire lasted for around five minutes before both Farook and Malik were killed by police bullets.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suspects"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN.Hero"/&gt; Farook died from 26 gunshot wounds, sustained mostly in the legs and including one in the chin where the bullet [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmented]] into his neck.

== Aftermath ==
After Farook and Malik's corpses were released by law enforcement, local [[Islamic funeral|Islamic cemeteries]] refused to accept the remains. It took a week to find a willing cemetery, and the burial ultimately took place in Rosamond, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enrique Marquez Charged With Conspiring With San Bernardino Shooter in 2011, 2012|url=http://ktla.com/2015/12/17/san-bernardino-mass-shooting-federal-prosecutors-expected-to-file-charges-against-gunmans-friend-enrique-marquez/|accessdate=August 19, 2016|publisher=KTLA|agency=CNN Wire|date=December 17, 2015|first1=Steve|last1=Kuzj|first2=Kirk|last2=Hawkins|first3=Rick|last3=Chambers}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to two members of the mosque, many of the city's Muslim community refused to attend the funeral on December 15, 2015, which was attended by around ten mourners including relatives of Farook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abutaleb|first1=Yasmeen|title=Corrected – San Bernardino shooters buried in quiet funeral following Islamic rituals|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/california-shooting-funeral-exclusive-idINKBN0U002F20151217|accessdate=December 17, 2015|agency=Reuters|date=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one Arabic-language online radio broadcast, ISIL described Farook and Malik as "supporters" following the attack. During the police investigation into the attack, ''The New York Times'' reported that this language indicated "a less direct connection" between the shooters and the terrorist group.&lt;ref name=NYTimes_soldiers&gt;{{cite news|last=Callimachi|first=Rukmini|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/world/middleeast/islamic-state-san-bernardino-massacre.html|title=Islamic State Says 'Soldiers of Caliphate' Attacked in San Bernardino|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 5, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI probes ISIS, terror links to San Bernardino massacre|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-bernardino-shooting-isis-20151204-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 5, 2015, English-language broadcast on its [[Al-Bayan (radio station)|Bayan radio station]], ISIL referred to Farook and Malik as "soldiers of the caliphate," which is a phrase ISIL uses to denote members of the terrorist organization. ''The New York Times'' reported that it was unclear why the two versions differed.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_soldiers" /&gt;

On February 9, 2016, the FBI announced that it was unable to unlock one of the mobile phones they had recovered from Farook and Malik's home because of the phone's advanced security features. The phone was an [[iPhone 5C]] owned by the county and issued to Farook during his employment with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-shooting-encryption-idUSKCN0VI22A|title=FBI director says investigators unable to unlock San Bernardino shooter's phone content|work=Reuters|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2016|first=Dustin|last=Volz|first2=Mark|last2=Hosenball}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/washington-794488-help-killer.html|title=SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTING: Apple must help US hack killer's phone|work=The Press-Enterprise|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2016|first=Tami|last=Abdollah|first2=Eric|last2=Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by the FBI to create a new version of the phone's [[iOS]] [[operating system]] that could be installed and run in the phone's [[random access memory]] to disable certain security features, [[Apple Inc.]] declined due to its policy to never undermine the security features of its products.

On May 31, 2016, federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit against Farook's family. This lawsuit would allow them to seize both the proceeds of two [[life insurance]] policies (and the policies themselves) held by Farook, both of which listed Farook's mother as the beneficiary. One policy worth {{US$|25,000}} was taken out by Farook in 2012 when he started working for the county, while the other, worth {{US$|250,000}}, was taken out the following year. According to [[NBC News]], "Under federal law, assets derived from terrorism are subject to forfeiture. A federal judge must approve an application before the government can seize the money."&lt;ref name=SernaParviniHamiltonKnoll /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/feds-file-suit-against-family-san-bernardino-shooter-seize-life-n583781|title=Feds File Suit Against Family of San Bernardino Shooter to Seize Life Insurance Policies|work=NBC News|date=June 1, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016|first=Andrew|last=Blankstein|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Chuck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/feds-file-suit-to-seize-san-bernardino-shooters-life-insurance/|title=Feds file suit to seize San Bernardino shooter's life insurance|publisher=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|date=May 31, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the six-page lawsuit, the life insurance company claimed that Farook's mother was aware of her son's intentions to carry out the attack, and reasoned that she should not be entitled to the benefits as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/life-805336-farook-lawsuit.html|title=SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTING: Lawsuit reveals quandary over shooter's life insurance benefits|work=The Press-Enterprise|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=June 12, 2016|first=Joe|last=Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, 2016, government officials said they wanted to give the money to the victims' families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc7.com/news/judge-may-decide-if-san-bernardino-shooters-life-insurance-money-goes-to-victims-or-mom/1496372/|title=Government Wants Money From Life Insurance Policies of San Bernardino Terror Shooter Given to Families' Victims|work=KABC-TV|date=September 2, 2016|accessdate=September 5, 2016|first=Rob|last=McMillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|Saurashtra (state)}}

Saurashtrians migrated from southern [[Gujarat]] in [[11th century]] AD after the fall of [[Somnath Temple]]&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sourashtra-community-in-celebration-mode/article6055990.ece|title=Sourashtra community in celebration mode|last=Rohith|first=S.

It is said that the Saurashtrians lived in [[Devagiri]], the present day [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]] of [[Maharashtra]] during the regime of the [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Yadava]] kings up to [[13th century]] AD. After the fall of [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Yadavas]] in [[14th century]] AD they moved to [[Vijayanagar Empire]] by the invitation of the Kings. The expansion of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar empire]] brought the Saurashtrians into [[South India]] in [[14th century]] AD, since they were highly skilled manufacturers of fine [[silk]] [[garments]] and were patronized by the Kings and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=FGvXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Saurashtra+Brahmins|title=Theerthayathra: A Pilgrimage Through Various Temples|last=Srikumaran|first=K.|date=2005|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|year=|isbn=9788172763633|location=|pages=125–126|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar empire]] they were welcomed by the [[Nayak dynasty|Nayak]] Kings of [[Thanjavur]] during mid [[16th century]] AD&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and [[Madurai]] during [[17th century]] AD and were allowed to settle near the [[Thirumalai Nayakkar Mahal|Thirumalai Nayakkar Palace.]]&lt;ref name="Vandhana"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurais-sourashtrians-are-a-disappointed-lot/article5910444.ece|title=Madurai’s Sourashtrians are a disappointed lot|last=Vandhana|first=M.|date=2014-04-14|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boloji.com/articles/759/the-unwritten-history-of-the-saurashtrians-of-south-india|title=The Unwritten History of the Saurashtrians of South India|last=T K|first=Ramesh|date=|work=Boloji|access-date=2018-02-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Saurashtrians of South India|last=Randle|first=H.N|publisher=K.

== Social Division ==
===Occupation, sects and gotras===
From the view point of an outsider the community may be seen as a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogenous]] one. However, in reality many subdivisions exist among them at various levels. Occupationally, the Saurashtrians may be classified broadly as [[Vedic priesthood|priests]], [[merchant]]s and [[Weaving|weavers]].

====Sects====
The Saurashtrians may further be divided into three sects on a [[Religion|religious]] basis. viz.,
* [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavites]], who wear the vertical Vaishnavite mark, and call themselves northerners;
* [[Smarta tradition|Smarthas]], who wear horizontal marks;
* [[Dvaita Vedanta|Madhvas]], who wear gopi (Sandal paste) as their sect mark.
All the above three divisions intermarry and interdine, and the religious difference does not create a distinction in the community. The Saurashtrians classify their ancestors as originally belonging to the two lines of ''Thiriyarisham'' and ''Pancharisham'' descent groups. Their religion is [[Hinduism]], they follow [[Yajurveda]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and they were originally [[Dvaita Vedanta|Madhvas]]. After their settlement in [[South India|Southern India]], some of them, owing to the preachings of [[Adi Shankara|Sankaracharya]] and [[Ramanuja]]charya, were converted into [[Shaivism|Saivites]] and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavites]] respectively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Gotras====
{{See also|Pravaras}}

Saurashtrians, like all other [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin|Brahmins]], trace their paternal ancestors to one of the seven or eight sages, the [[Saptarshi|saptarishis]]. They classify themselves into [[Gotra|gotras]], named after the ancestor [[rishi]] and each gotra consists of different family names. The gotra was inherited from [[Guru]] at the time of [[Upanayana]], in ancient times, so it is a remnant of Guru-shishya tradition, but since the tradition is no longer followed, during Upanayana ceremony father acts as Guru of his son, so the son inherits his father's gotra. The entire community consists of 64 [[gotra]]s.

Saurashtrians belong to following gotras.

Marriage within common [[gotra]] is strictly prohibited.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Castes and Tribes of South India"|last=Edgar Thurston|first=K.

== Culture ==
===Saṃskāras, rituals and Festivals===
Saurashtrians have been traditionally an [[Orthodox Hinduism|orthodox]] and closely knit community. They are essentially [[Aryan|northern]] in their customs, manners and social structure. Traditionally, joint family was a social and economic unit for them. Moreover, the pattern of joint family helped them transmit their [[tradition]]al culture to the younger generations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

====Saṃskāras====
Saurashtrians strictly adhere to all the ''[[Saṃskāra|Ṣoḍaśa Saṃskāra]]'' or 16 [[Hindu]] [[Sanskara (rite of passage)|Samskaras]],&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; out of which, the main social customs among them consist of six social [[Ceremony|ceremonies]] in the life of a person. (1) the [[naming ceremony]]; (2) the [[Upanayana|sacred thread]] ceremony; (3) [[puberty]]; (4) [[marriage]]; (5) the attainment of the age of sixty; (6) the [[Antyesti|funeral rites]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=69yAAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=|title=Oral literature of the Saurashtrans|last=Učida|first=Norihiko|date=1979|publisher=Simant Publications India|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[rite]]s that are performed following the birth of a child are known as ''[[Jatakarma|jathakarma]]''. The naming ceremony in particular is known as ''[[namakarana]]m''. The main aim of performing these birth ceremonies is to purify and to safeguard the child from diseases. These rituals are believed to check the ill effects of Planetary movement. The above rites were carried out on the eleventh day after birth of the child. Grandfather's name was much preferred for a male child and the name of a female deity was suggested for female child.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The ''vaduhom'' ceremony ([[Sacred thread ceremony|Sacred Thread ceremony]]) of Saurashtrians is basically the ''[[upanayana]]m'' ceremony. This ceremony is exceedingly important among them. This is performed between seventh and thirteenth years. In rare cases when the sacred thread ceremony was not held in the young ages, it would be performed at the time of marriage. The goal of this ceremony was to highlight their [[Brahminical]] status. During this ceremony there was much feasting and entertainment which lasted for four days.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Among the Saurashtrians, attaining [[puberty]] was the greatest event in a girl's life. They also perform a pre-puberty marriage.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

The wedding ceremony lasted 11 days with as many as 36 [[ritual]]s. All these rituals were conducted by the Saurashtrian [[Vedic priesthood|priests]] who were a separate clan in the community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Saurashtrians have their own marital arrangements. Before a marriage is fixed, a long negotiation takes place between the parents of both partners. Being traditional [[Orthodox Hinduism|orthodox]] [[Hindu]]s they are very much particular in matching the [[horoscope]] of the couple. A man may claim his maternal uncle's daughter as his wife, and [[polygamy]] is permitted. Girls get married at an early age. Marriage within common gotra is strictly prohibited among them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

Death rituals are termed as ''abarakkirigai'' or ''[[Antyesti|andhiyaeshti]]'' in the Saurashtrian community. ''[[Antyesti|Andhiyaeshti]]'' means the last or final fire. These rituals are carried out by the eldest son of the deceased. In case of no son, the relatives carry out the last rites. ''Kartha'' is the name given to the one who carries out this rite. The performance of the rite signifies the belief that the life is continuous and does not end by one's death. Further, the deceased are believed to reach the level of the deities. The period of mourning lasts for ten days, but it is repeated every year in the form of ''[[Śrāddha|sraddha]]'' ceremonies.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

====Festivals====
The Saurashtrians are of a religious bent of mind and they value morality and high character. The chief divinity of Saurashtrians is [[Venkateswara|Venkateshwara]] of [[Tirupati]]. Among other Gods they worshipped Sun God, [[Rama]] etc. They made regular visits to [[Meenakshi Temple|Meenakshi temple]]. They celebrate [[Kolattam]], [[Chithirai festival]] and [[Rama Navami|Ramanavami]] with great enthusiasm, and observe [[Diwali|Deepawali]], [[Ganesh Chaturthi|Ganesh Chathurthi]], [[Dussehra]], [[Vaikuntha Ekadashi|Vaikunta Ekadasi]] and [[Avani Avittam]] as important religious days.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Their present social customs differ markedly from the traditional pattern and bear a close resemblance to those of [[Tamils]]. Only some orthodox well-to-do [[merchant]] families stick to their older customs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

===Cuisine===

Several historians believe that it was Saurashtrian [[textile]] merchants who introduced idly to [[South India]] during the 10th and 12th centuries. There are even claims that a mix of rice and [[urad dal]] ground together and later steamed to form cakes had its origins in [[Gujarat]]. This was called ''Iddada''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://food.manoramaonline.com/food/foodie/2017/03/30/celebrating-moon-faced-health-food-world-idly-day.html|title=Celebrating the moon-faced health food on World Idli Day|work=OnManorama|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

There are three group of Saurashtrians living in [[Tamil Nadu]]. First migrants came to [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]] and settled there, second group of migrants settled in [[Tanjore|Thanjavur]] and its surrounding places and later third group of migrants settled in [[Madurai]] and its surrounding places. Saurashtrians maintain a predominant presence in [[Madurai]], a city, also known as 'Temple City' in the southern part of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Though official figures are hard to come by, it is believed that the Saurashtrian population is anywhere between one-fourth and one-fifth of the city's total population.

The mother tongue of Saurashtrians is [[Saurashtra language|Saurashtra]] (alternate names and spellings: Sourashtra, Sowrashtra, Sourashtri, Palkar), a [[dialect]] of [[Gujarati languages|Gujarati]] with the amalgamation of present-day [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] &amp; [[Tamil language|Tamil]] but all of them are [[Multilingualism|bilingual]]&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and can speak either [[Tamil language|Tamil]] or [[Telugu language|Telugu]] or one of the local languages.

== Organisation ==
The prominent leaders among the community arose in the late [[19th century]] and felt the need of organizing the community. At first, the Madurai Saurashtra Sabha was formed in the year 1895 and it was formally registered in the year 1900 with many objectives. The formation of this Sabha was the first step towards [[social mobilization]]. The Sabha's administration is carried out by elected Councillors and office bearers. It has its own rules and regulations regarding holding of elections, rights and duties of office bearers and celebration of social functions. The election to the Sabha is held once in three years. The [[social]] life of the Saurashtrians is controlled almost wholly by the Saurashtra Sabha. This organisation is a committee of the leading men of the community, which manages and controls all the schools and public institutions, the [[temple]] and its worship, and all political, [[Religion|religious]], and social questions among the Saurashtrians.

The Saurashtra Madhya (central) Sabha, which has its headquarters at [[Madurai]] now remains as the cultural center for all the Saurashtrians living in [[Tamil Nadu]]. Many well-to-do [[merchant]]s and [[philanthropists]] of the community have contributed substantially to the growth of these institutions. Today, the Saurashtrians are represented in white collar jobs and professions in large numbers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Standing-tall-in-all-fronts/article14852589.ece|title=Standing tall in all fronts|last=Kavitha|first=S.S|date=2007-10-08|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-03-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Narendra Modi]], the 16th [[Prime Minister of India]], inaugurated the Research Institute of Saurashtra Heritage and Immigration (RISHI), a project in association with [[Saurashtra University]], [[Rajkot]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Politics ==

In the second decade of [[20th century]], the Saurashtrians emerged as a dominant group in social and political life of [[Madras Presidency]]. The Saurashtrians emerged as the dominant social group because of their collective mobilization, intellectual leadership, education, wealth, trade and enterprise. There are several instances when the leaders of the community organised the [[Weaving|weavers]] and made social and economic protests. The well-to-do [[merchant]]s of the community made donations to [[Tamil Nadu Congress Committee|TNCC]] for [[Vedaranyam March|Salt Satyagraha]] and welcomed any form of [[Swadeshi movement|Swadeshi]] agitation which favoured [[Indian people|Indian]] cloth.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fLY7v3tbM8kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=L.K.Tulsiram&amp;f=false|title=Politics and Social Conflict in South India: The Non-Brahman Movement and Tamil Separatism, 1916-1929|last=Irschick|first=Eugene F.|last2=Studies|first2=University of California, Berkeley Center for South and Southeast Asia|date=1969|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=9,138|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaders who came to lead the community were not always from the upper class. L.K. Thulasiram, who led the community in [[Madurai]], was not born into the [[Aristocratic family|aristocratic]] family. With his own efforts he travelled abroad which brought prosperity to himself and to the community in general. Thulasiram at first supported the non-[[Brahmin]] movement in [[Tamil Nadu]]. When he earned the displeasure of his community members who were fighting for [[Brahminical]] status, he changed his mind and supported the cause of his own people.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; He got elected as Municipal Chairman in 1921 amidst a fierce contest. During his tenure he brought many reforms within the community. He introduced free mid-day meal scheme in community owned school for the first time in the country which was later emulated by the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] during the period of [[K. Kamaraj]] in the name of [[Noon meal scheme|noon-meal scheme]] in Government schools.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; When he lost his hold in [[Municipal council|Municipal Council]], he became a prominent organizer of [[non-cooperation movement]]. Later he impressed the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] and became the leader of the [[merchant]]s. In this capacity he strove hard to raise the prestige and position of his community.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of South India, 1920-1937|last=Backer|first=C.J|publisher=Vikas Publishing House|year=1976|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=143–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[N. M. R. Subbaraman|N.M.R. Subbaraman]], another leader of the community, financed and led the [[Salt March|Civil Disobedience Movement]] In [[Madurai]] from 1930-32. He worked for the advancement of the depressed classes. He, along with [[A. Vaidyanatha Iyer]], organised a temple entry conference and helped the people of the depressed classes to enter [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]]. He was involved in the [[Bhoodan movement]] and donated his 100 acres of land to the movement. He contributed to establishing the first [[Gandhi Memorial Museum, Madurai|Gandhi Memorial Museum]] in Madurai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/throwing-light-on-the-life-of-madurai-gandhi/article3092865.ece|title=Throwing light on the life of `Madurai Gandhi'|date=2006-08-20|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he expressed his dissatisfaction with [[Civil disobedience|Civil Disobedience]]. He felt unhappy about the expenditure incurred on the agitational activities. He mobilized his followers into Municipal politics with the help of Venkatamarama Iyer faction under the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] banner.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Tennessee, 2012#District 4}}
By the 2012 election, the Fourth District had been significantly altered as a result of redistricting.  Notably, [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], formerly the heart of the 6th District, was shifted into the 4th. The redrawn 4th contains about half of the constituents who resided in the former 4th district, with 14 of 24 counties moved elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins |first=Michael |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2012/jan/15/desjarlais-has-to-scramble-with-new-district/ |title=DesJarlais has to scramble with new district alignment » Knoxville News Sentinel |publisher=Knoxnews.com |date=October 26, 2012 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DesJarlais was challenged by Democratic nominee and [[Tennessee Senate|state senator]] [[Eric Stewart (Tennessee politician)|Eric Stewart]]. For a time, it was thought that DesJarlais would face a primary challenge from state senator [[Bill Ketron]], a Murfreesboro resident and the chairman of the state senate redistricting committee, but Ketron did not run. DesJarlais defeated Stewart 56%–44%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=705219 |title=Ourcampaigns.com |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnelex"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/TN# |title=Tennessee election results |date=November 2012 |work=CNN |accessdate=November 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112210952/http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/TN |archivedate=November 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; joining all the other incumbent members of Tennessee congressional delegation in winning reelection.&lt;ref name="CBS election"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newschannel5.com/story/20024413/desjarlais-wins-second-term-despite-scandal|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129191227/http://www.newschannel5.com/story/20024413/desjarlais-wins-second-term-despite-scandal|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 29, 2013|title=DesJarlais Wins Second Term Despite Scandal|date=November 7, 2012|work=NewsChannel5.com | location=Nashville|publisher=CBS|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scandals====
Late in the 2012 campaign, more events from DesJarlais's personal life became public, making the race against Stewart "one of the ugliest Tennessee congressional races in decades".&lt;ref name="freepress2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2012/nov/07/chattanooga-scott-desjarlais-holds-lead/|title=Scott DesJarlais holds lead (with video) |first=Andy|last=Sher|date=November 7, 2012|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012 the [[Huffington Post]] obtained a transcript of a September 2000 phone conversation in which DesJarlais pressured a mistress to get an abortion.&lt;ref name="mcauliff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/10/scott-desjarlais-abortion-pro-life_n_1953136.html|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|title=Scott DesJarlais, Pro-Life Republican Congressman And Doctor, Pressured Mistress Patient To Get Abortion|date=October 10, 2012|last=McAuliff|first=Michael|accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/10/10/republican-rep-scott-desjarlais-pressed-mistress-to-get-an-abortion-report-says/ |title=Republican Rep.

In October he wrote to supporters on Facebook, "The media wrongly reported that I recorded the conversation myself. I was recorded unknowingly and without my consent."&lt;ref name=nooga&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nooga.com/158484/rep-scott-desjarlais-quiet-as-records-contradict-recent-comments/ |title=DesJarlais quiet as records contradict recent comments |last1=Harrison |first1=James |date=November 16, 2012 |website=nooga.com |publisher=Chattanooga Media Group |access-date=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine days before the general election a second woman came forward to state that she began dating DesJarlais while she was his patient. She alleged that the two smoked marijuana together and that he prescribed pain medications for her while she was at his house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2012/oct/28/2nd-desjarlais-girlfriend-talks-tennessee/ |title=2nd Scott DesJarlais girlfriend talks |publisher=timesfreepress.com |date= |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/28/scott-desjarlais-second-mistress_n_2034414.html|publisher=Huffington Post|title=Scott DesJarlais' Second Mistress: Another Woman Claims Affair With Tennessee Congressman|date=October 28, 2012|last=McAuliff|first=Michael|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks after DesJarlais won the 2012 election, the ''[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]'' obtained a full transcript of DesJarlais's 2001 divorce proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;The state Democratic Party had fought DesJarlais's lawyers to get the documents—which ultimately ran to 679 typed pages, as transcribed from court reporters' [[shorthand]]—released, but the court ruled that it could not be entered into the public record until it was properly transcribed in its entirety. DesJarlais lost the case, but the ruling came the day before the election.{{cite web |url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/news/story/2012/nov/06/scott-desjarlais-divorce-transcript-released/92138/ |title=Scott DesJarlais divorce transcript released |last1=Carroll |first1=Chris |last2=Belz |first2=Kate |date=November 6, 2012 |publisher=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]] |access-date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transcript revealed that DesJarlais had admitted under oath to at least six sexual relationships with people he came in contact with while chief of staff at Grandview Medical Center in [[Jasper, Tennessee]]. Among them were three co-workers, two patients and a drug representative.&lt;ref name="supported"/&gt; The transcript also revealed that his former wife had had two abortions,&lt;ref name="supported"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2012/nov/15/scott-desjarlais-supported-abortions-slept-patient|title=Scott DesJarlais supported ex-wife's abortions, slept with patients, divorce transcript shows|author1=Chris Carroll|author2=Kate Harrison|publisher=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael McAuliff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/15/scott-desjarlais-approved_n_2140171.html |title=Scott DesJarlais Approved Wife's Abortion, Slept With Coworkers, Patients, Court Records Say  |author= Michael McAuliff |date=November 16, 2012 |accessdate=December 25, 2012 |work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesfreepress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2013/may/24/desjarlais-fined-for-sex-with-2-patients/ |title=U.S. Rep.

"It was never my intention to mislead anyone, and had I read this, I don't think the inaccuracies that occurred would have taken place."&lt;ref name=nooga/&gt;

Three weeks after he won the election, DesJarlais said on a conservative talk radio show that "God has forgiven me" and asked "fellow Christians" and constituents "to consider doing the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/20229011/scott-desjarlais-says-god-has-forgiven-me |title=Scott DesJarlais says ‘God has forgiven me’ |author=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]] |date=November 30, 2012 |publisher=wrcbtv.com |access-date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formal reprimand====
In October 2012, the [[watchdog journalism|watchdog group]] [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) requested that the Tennessee Board of Health investigate evidence that DesJarlais had had a sexual relationship with a patient, in violation of the Tennessee Medical Practice Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Chas | last = Sisk | title = Rep.

In November 2012, after further details of the divorce proceedings were published, CREW asked the House of Representatives' [[Office of Congressional Ethics]] to investigate whether DesJarlais had violated House ethics rules, asserting that he had "blatantly" lied when he denied having taped the telephone conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Paul C. | last = Barton | title = Watchdog group files ethics complaint against Rep.

During a trial for his divorce from his first wife in 2000, DesJarlais testified that he had sexual affairs with at least two patients, three coworkers and a drug representative while he was working as a hospital chief of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2012/nov/16/scott-desjarlais-supported-ex-wifes-abortions/92999/|title=Scott DesJarlais supported ex-wife's abortions, slept with patients|newspaper=[[Times Free Press]]|date=November 16, 2012|first1=Chris|last1=Carroll|first2=Kate|last2=Belz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his public opposition to legal abortion, DesJarlais encouraged his ex-wife to terminate two pregnancies and encouraged a former patient with whom he was having an affair to get an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/16/congressman-who-advised-ex-wife-to-seek-abortion-votes-for-late-term-abortion-ban/|title=Congressman who advised ex-wife to seek abortion votes for late-term abortion ban|last=Holley|first=Peter|date=2015-05-16|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Shōji Nishimura'''|西村 祥治|Nishimura Shōji|extra=30 November 1889 – 24 October 1944}} was an admiral in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]].

==Biography==
Nishimura was from [[Akita prefecture]] in the northern [[Tōhoku region]] of Japan. He was a graduate of the 39th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in 1911, ranking 21st out of 148 cadets. As a [[midshipman]], he served on the [[cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Aso||2}} and [[battleship]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}}. After his commissioning as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]], he was assigned back to ''Aso'', and then to the [[battlecruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}}&lt;!-- ''Hiei'' wasn't corverted into a battleship until much later... --&gt;.

He attended naval artillery and torpedo school from 1914–1915, and was then assigned to the [[destroyer]] {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Yugiri|1899|2}}, cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yakumo||2}} and battlecruiser {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}}&lt;!-- ''Haruna'' wasn't converted into a battleship until much later...--&gt;.

As a [[lieutenant]] from 1917, he specialized in navigation, and served as chief navigator on a large number of vessels, including the [[corvette]] {{Ship|Japanese corvette|Yamato||2}}, destroyers {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kawakaze|1917|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Tanikaze|1918|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Yura||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Sunosaki||2}}, cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Kitakami||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Ōi||2}}, and battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hizen||2}}. Nishimura was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]] in 1928. He was subsequently chief navigator on the cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Nisshin||2}}. He was given his first command on 1 November 1926: the destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kiku|1920|2}}. He subsequently was captain of the destroyers {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Wakatake||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Urakaze|1915|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Mikazuki|1926|2}}, and (after his promotion to [[Commander#Commander as a naval rank|commander]] in 1929) {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Shirakumo|1927|2}}. In the 1930s, he was assigned command of the 26th Destroyer Group.

Promoted to [[Captain (naval)|captain]] in 1934, and briefly commander of the 19th Destroyer Group, Nishimura then served as captain of the cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Kumano||2}} (from 1937–1938) and the reconstructed [[fast battleship]] ''Haruna''&lt;!-- To differentiate between her origin as a battlecruiser and her status as a fast battleship after her moderization... --&gt; (from 1938–1940). He became a [[rear admiral]] on 15 November 1940, and a [[Vice Admiral|vice admiral]] on 1 November 1943.

Nishimura gained much fame as the commander of the 4th Destroyer Squadron during the [[Battle of the Java Sea]]. In June 1942, he was named the commander of the 7th Cruiser Division and participated in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]].&lt;ref name="Klemen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Klemen|first=L|url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/nishimura.html|title=Rear-Admiral Shoji Nishimura|date= 1999–2000|work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the war, Nishimura was named the commander of the "Southern Force"&lt;ref name= "Klemen"/&gt; in "Operation ''Sho-Go''", aimed at a final and decisive naval battle against the [[United States Navy]] in the [[Philippines]]. Nishimura's Force "C" consisted of battleships {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Fusō||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}}, [[heavy cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Mogami|1934|2}}, and destroyers [[Japanese destroyer Shigure (1935)|''Shigure'']], [[Japanese destroyer Michishio|''Michishio'']], [[Japanese destroyer Asagumo (1938)|''Asagumo'']], and [[Japanese destroyer Yamagumo (1937)|''Yamagumo'']]. In the [[Surigao Strait]] between [[Leyte]] and [[Dinagat Islands]] on the evening of 24 October 1944, he contacted the [[United States Seventh Fleet|U.S. 7th Fleet]] under [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Jesse Oldendorf]], which consisted of six battleships, eight cruisers, 29 destroyers, and 39 motor torpedo boats. Nishimura's force was crushed when the Americans [[crossing the T|crossed the Japanese "T"]]. Nishimura was killed during the battle when his flagship, the ''Yamashiro'', was sunk after being hit multiple times from the U.S. battleships.&lt;ref name="Klemen"/&gt;

'''Thomas Edward "Tommy" Hughes''' (25 December 1886 – 19 August 1981) was an [[Australian rules football]]er who played with [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), usually playing on the wing or in defence.

==Military Service==
He enlisted in the First AIF on 27 November 1915.

Some mistaken sources, confusing Hughes with one of two other AIF men of the same name who were killed in action,&lt;ref&gt;Namely, Private Thomas Edward Hughes (75) who died of his wounds on 8 October 1917, and Private Thomas Edward Hughes (4823) who was killed in action on 3 September 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that he was been killed in the Somme during [[World War I]]; when, in fact, he returned to Australia on 23 June 1919.

Other mistaken sources based their statements on the obituary of "Private Tom Hughes" that appeared in ''The Winner'' of 6 June 1917,&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/154544661 Brave Footballers, ''The Winner'', (Wednesday, 6 June 1917), p.8.]&lt;/ref&gt; without having seen the retraction notice published a week later,&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/154545949 Statement Corrected, ''The Winner'', (Wednesday, 13 June 1917), p.8.]&lt;/ref&gt; that clearly stated that the deceased "Private Tom Hughes" was not one and the same as the "Gunner Tom Hughes" who once played for Carlton.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, the deceased "Private Tom Hughes" was Private Albert Thomas Hughes (5985), who was killed in action on 3 May 1917 (see: [https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/R1632396 Roll of Honour: Private Albert Thomas Hughes (5985), ''Australian War Museum'']).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also: Tommy Hughes, ''blueseum.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
He died on 19 August 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6zJVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=h5QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1777%2C1440583 Deaths: Hughes, ''The Age'', (Thursday, 21 August 1981), p.30.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Val Allen Browning''' (August 20, 1895 – May 16, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Deaths | date=May 19, 1994 | work=[[Deseret News]] | location=Salt Lake City, Utah | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/354038/ | accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American industrialist, philanthropist and third-generation gunmaker. His grandfather, [[Jonathan Browning (inventor)|Jonathan Browning]], opened a gun shop in [[Ogden, Utah]] in 1852, and his father, [[John M. Browning|John Browning]],  is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"By 1900, over 75% of the repeating sporting arms on the United States market, both lever and pump, were of John's invention." [http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5508.pdf Browning Firearms Collection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120215642/http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5508.pdf |date=2012-11-20 }} brochure from The American Society of Mechanical Engineers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], [[Utah Territory]], Browning graduated from [[Ogden High School (Utah)|Ogden High School]] in 1913 and later studied law and engineering at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;Gun Digest 2011 by Dan Shideler, Krause Publications, Jul 14, 2010, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man he worked in the shop his grandfather had opened.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden's Trolley District, by Shalae Larsen, Sue Wilkerson, Arcadia Publishing, 2012, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Browning was commissioned as a second lieutenant with the [[United States Army]] and served with the [[79th Infantry Division (United States)|79th Infantry Division]] at [[Verdun]] during World War I. In 1920, he became the manager of the manufacturing of [[John M. Browning|John Browning]] guns in [[Liège (city)|Liege]], [[Belgium]], and served as his father's personal representative to [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]]. Upon his father's death in 1926, Browning had the responsibility of completing the projects that were not finished by his father, including the [[Browning Superposed]] shotgun and the [[Browning Hi-Power|Browning Hi-Power pistol (GP-35)]] (the latter in cooperation with his father's Belgian assistant, [[Dieudonné Saive]]).

In 1924, Browning married Ann Chaffin (1901–1975) of [[Farmington, Utah]], and they had four children. They lived in [[Belgium]] until 1935 when Browning returned to [[Utah]] as president of [[Browning Arms Company]].

Browning received 48 gun patents during his career, compared to his father [[John M. Browning|John Browning's]] 128 American gun patents. In 1955, Val Browning was awarded Knighthood in the [[Order of Léopold]] by [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]] of [[Belgium]] for an "outstanding contribution to the Gun Making Art;" an honor that had been bestowed upon his father in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/353829/VAL-A-BROWNING-INDUSTRIALIST-AND-PHILANTHROPIST-DIES-AT-98.html VAL A. BROWNING, INDUSTRIALIST AND PHILANTHROPIST, DIES AT 98] Deseret news, May 18, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Browning spent his career representing business interests in the United States and Europe. In addition to chairing Browning Arms, he served as director of the First Security Corporation, [[Utah Construction Company|Utah International]], [[Amalgamated Sugar Company]], and the Mountain Fuel Supply Company. Through the 1940s purchase of some of W. L. Wattis' of founding shares in [[Utah Construction Company]], Browning shared in the substantial gains in the sale of [[Utah Construction Company|Utah International]]. Browning was a benefactor of the [[Dixie State University]] and [[Weber State University]], and his donation of his substantial collection of European fine art formed the basis of the [[Utah Museum of Fine Arts]] masterwork paintings.

Browning died in 1994. He was a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

{{Gnosticism}}
'''Valentinus''' (also spelled '''Valentinius'''; {{circa|AD&amp;nbsp;100}}&amp;nbsp;– {{circa|lk=no|160}}) was the best known and for a time most successful [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] [[Theology|theologian]]. He founded his school in [[Rome]]. According to [[Tertullian]], Valentinus was a candidate for [[bishop of Rome]] but started his own group when another was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;''Adversus Valentinianos'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentinus produced a variety of writings, but only fragments survive, largely those embedded in refuted quotations in the works of his opponents, not enough to reconstruct his system except in broad outline.&lt;ref name ="Oxford"&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Valentinus''&lt;/ref&gt; His doctrine is known to us only in the developed and modified form given to it by his disciples.&lt;ref name ="Oxford"/&gt; He taught that there were three kinds of people, the spiritual, psychical, and material; and that only those of a spiritual nature received the ''[[gnosis]]'' (knowledge) that allowed them to return to the divine [[Pleroma]], while those of a psychic nature (ordinary Christians) would attain a lesser or uncertain form of salvation, and that those of a material nature were doomed to perish.&lt;ref name ="Oxford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnosis.org/naghamm/tripart.htm ''The Tripartite Tractate'', §14]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter VI.|Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haeresies'' i. 6]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentinus had a large following, the [[Valentinianism|Valentinians]].&lt;ref name ="Oxford"/&gt; It later divided into an Eastern and a Western, or Italian, branch.&lt;ref name ="Oxford"/&gt; The [[Marcosians]] belonged to the Western branch.&lt;ref name ="Oxford"/&gt;

==Biography==
Epiphanius wrote ({{circa|390}}) that he learned through word of mouth (although he acknowledged that it was a disputed point) that Valentinus was born in Phrebonis in the [[Nile Delta]], and thus was a native of Paralia in Egypt, and received his Greek education in nearby [[Alexandria]], an important and metropolitan [[early centers of Christianity|early center of Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius §31 in {{cite book|translator-last=Williams|translator-first=Frank|title=The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis, Book I (Sections 1–46)|location=Boston|publisher=Brill|year=2009|p=166|isbn=9789004170179}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he may have heard the Christian philosopher [[Basilides]] and certainly became conversant with Hellenistic [[Middle Platonism]] and the culture of Hellenized Jews like the great Alexandrian Jewish allegorist and philosopher [[Philo]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

[[Clement of Alexandria]] records that his followers said that Valentinus was a follower of [[Theudas (teacher of Valentinius)|Theudas]], and that Theudas in turn was a follower of [[Paul the Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/ANF-02/anf02-69.htm#P9770_2756928 Stromateis, book 7, chapter 17]. "Likewise they allege that Valentinus was a hearer of Theudas. And he was the pupil of Paul."&lt;/ref&gt; Valentinus said that Theudas imparted to him the secret wisdom that Paul had taught privately to his inner circle, which Paul publicly referred to in connection with his visionary encounter with the risen Christ ([[Romans 16]]:25; [[1 Corinthians 2]]:7; [[2 Corinthians 12]]:2–4; [[Acts 9]]:9–10), when he received the secret teaching from him.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Such [[Western esotericism|esoteric teachings]] were downplayed in Rome after the mid-[[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]].&lt;ref&gt;The article [[esoteric Christianity]] focuses on Early Modern and modern esoteric Christian revivals.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentinus taught first in [[Alexandria]] and went to [[Rome]] about 136, during the pontificate of [[Pope Hyginus]], and remained until the pontificate of [[Pope Anicetus]]. In [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian14.html ''Adversus Valentinianos''], iv, [[Tertullian]] says:
{{quote|Valentinus had expected to become a bishop, because he was an able man both in genius and eloquence. Being indignant, however, that another obtained the dignity by reason of a claim which confessorship had given him, he broke with the church of the true faith. Just like those (restless) spirits which, when roused by ambition, are usually inflamed with the desire of revenge, he applied himself with all his might to exterminate the truth; and finding the clue of a certain old opinion, he marked out a path for himself with the subtlety of a serpent.}}

Commonly unaccepted, we cannot know the accuracy of this statement, since it is delivered by his orthodox adversary Tertullian, but according to a tradition reported in the late fourth century by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], he withdrew to [[Cyprus]], where he continued to teach and draw adherents. He died probably about 160 or 161.

While Valentinus was alive he made many disciples, and his system was the most widely diffused of all the forms of Gnosticism, although, as Tertullian remarked, it developed into several different versions, not all of which acknowledged their dependence on him ("they affect to disavow their name").  Among the more prominent disciples of Valentinus was [[Bardaisan]], invariably linked to Valentinus in later references, as well as [[Heracleon]], [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]] and [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]]. Many of the writings of these Gnostics, and a large number of excerpts from the writings of Valentinus, existed only in quotes displayed by their orthodox detractors, until 1945, when the cache of writings at [[Nag Hammadi]] revealed a Coptic version of the ''[[Gospel of Truth]],'' which is the title of a text that, according to [[Irenaeus]], was the same as the ''Gospel of Valentinus'' mentioned by [[Tertullian]] in his ''Against All Heresies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Tertullian]]|title=Against All Heresies: Valentinus, Ptolemy and Secundus, Heracleon (Book I, Chapter 4)| url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0319.htm|publisher=NewAdvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian [[heresiology|heresiologist]]s also wrote details about the life of Valentinus, often scurrilous. As mentioned above, Tertullian claimed that Valentinus was a candidate for bishop, after which he turned to heresy in a fit of pique. Epiphanius wrote that Valentinus gave up the true faith after he had suffered a shipwreck in [[Cyprus]] and became insane. These descriptions can be reconciled, and are not impossible; but few scholars cite these accounts as other than rhetorical insults

==Valentinianism==
{{Main|Valentinianism}}
''[[Valentinianism]]'' is the name for the school of gnostic philosophy tracing back to Valentinus. It was one of the major gnostic movements, having widespread following throughout the Roman Empire and provoking voluminous writings by Christian heresiologists. Notable Valentinians included [[Heracleon]], [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]], [[Florinus (Gnostic)|Florinus]], [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]] and [[Axionicus]].

Valentinus professed to have derived his ideas from Theodas or [[Theudas (teacher of Valentinius)|Theudas]], a disciple of Paul.  Valentinus drew freely on some books of the New Testament. Unlike a great number of other gnostic systems, which are expressly [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]], Valentinus developed a system that was more monistic, albeit expressed in dualistic terms.&lt;ref&gt;'Valentinian gnosticism&amp;nbsp;... differs essentially from dualism' ([[Elaine Pagels]], ''The Gnostic Gospels'', 1978); 'a standard element in the interpretation of Valentinianism and similar forms of Gnosticism is the recognition that they are fundamentally monistic' (William Schoedel, 'Gnostic Monism and the Gospel of Truth' in ''The Rediscovery of Gnosticism, Vol.1: The School of Valentinus'', edited by Bentley Layton, E.J. Brill, Leiden, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===
Valentinian literature described the primal being, called ''[[Bythos]]'', as the beginning of all things. After ages of silence and contemplation, Bythos gave rise to other beings by a process of emanation. The first series of beings, the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|aeons]], were thirty in number, representing fifteen [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygies]] or pairs sexually complementary. Through the error of [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]], one of the lowest aeons, and the ignorance of Sakla, the lower world with its subjection to matter is brought into existence. Man, the highest being in the lower world, participates in both the psychic and the hylic (material) nature, and the work of redemption consists in freeing the higher, the spiritual, from its servitude to the lower. This was the word and mission of Jesus and the holy spirit. Valentinius' Christology may have posited the existence of three redeeming beings, but Jesus while on [[Earth]] had a supernatural body which, for instance, "did not experience corruption" by defecating, according to Clement:&lt;ref&gt;Clement, ''Stromateis'' 3.59.3 translated B. Layton p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; there is also no mention of the account of Jesus's suffering in [[First Epistle of Peter]], nor of any other, in any Valentinian text. The Valentinian system was comprehensive, and was worked out to cover all phases of thought and action.

Valentinius was among the early Christians who attempted to align Christianity with [[Platonism]],{{citation needed|reason=no similarity at all between platonism and Valentinianism, while conventional Logos-theology might actually be influenced from Platonism|date=March 2015}} drawing [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] conceptions from the Platonic world of ideal forms (''[[pleroma]]'') and the lower world of phenomena (''[[kenoma]]'').  Of the mid-2nd century thinkers and preachers who were declared heretical by Irenaeus and later mainstream Christians, only [[Marcion of Sinope]] is as outstanding as a personality. The contemporary orthodox counter to Valentinius was [[Justin Martyr]], though it was Irenaeus of Lyons who presented the most vigorous challenge to the Valentinians.

===Trinity===
Valentinus's name came up in the [[Arianism|Arian]] disputes in the fourth century when [[Marcellus of Ancyra]], a staunch opponent of [[Arianism]], denounced the belief in God existing in three ''hypostases'' as heretical. Marcellus, who believed Father and Son to be one and the same, attacked his opponents by attempting to link them to Valentinus:
{{quote|Now with the heresy of the Ariomaniacs, which has corrupted the Church of God... These then teach three hypostases, just as Valentinus the heresiarch first invented in the book entitled by him 'On the Three Natures'. For he was the first to invent three hypostases and three persons of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and he is discovered to have filched this from [[Hermes]] and [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcellus, in Logan 2000:95&lt;/ref&gt;}}
While this accusation is often sourced in stating Valentinus believed in a Triune Godhead, there is in fact no corroborating evidence that Valentinus ever taught these things. Irenaeus makes no mention of this in any of his five books against heresies, even though he deals with Valentinianism extensively in them. Rather, he indicates that Valentinus believed in the pre-existent Aeon known as Proarche, Propator, and Bythus who existed alongside Ennœa, and they together begot Monogenes and Aletheia: and these constituted the first-begotten Pythagorean Tetrad, from whom thirty Aeons were produced.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 1.1.1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in the work cited by Marcellus, the three natures are said to have been the three natures of man,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th Edition|last=|first=|work=Valentinus|publisher=Cambridge|year=1911|isbn=|location=|pages=854}}&lt;/ref&gt;  concerning which Irenaeus writes: "They conceive, then, of three kinds of men, spiritual, material, and animal, represented by Cain, Abel, and Seth. These three natures are no longer found in one person,  but constitute various kinds [of men]. The material goes, as a matter of course, into corruption."&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103107.htm Against Heresies, 1.7.5]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Eusebius, Marcellus had a habit of mercilessly launching unsubstantiated attacks against his opponents, even those who had done him no wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, Against Marcellus, Book I&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valentinus' detractors==
Shortly after Valentinus' death, [[Irenaeus]] began his massive work ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis]]'' (better known as ''Adversus Haereses'') with a highly negative portrayal of Valentinus and his teachings, which occupies most of his first book. A modern student, [[M.&amp;nbsp;T. Riley]], observes that Tertullian's ''Adversus Valentinianos'' retranslated some passages from Irenaeus, without adding original material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/articles/riley_adv_val/riley_00_index.htm M.T. Riley].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] discussed and dismissed him (''Haer.'', XXXI). As with all the non-traditional early Christian writers, Valentinus has been known largely through quotations in the works of his detractors, though an Alexandrian follower also preserved some fragmentary sections as extended quotes. A Valentinian teacher [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]] refers to "apostolic tradition which we too have received by succession" in his ''[[Letter to Flora]]''. Ptolemy is known only for this letter to a wealthy gnostic lady named Flora, a letter itself only known by its full inclusion in [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]]' ''Panarion''. The letter describes the gnostic doctrine about the [[Torah|laws of Moses]] and their relation to the [[demiurge]]. The possibility should not be ignored that the letter was composed by Epiphanius, in the manner of composed speeches that ancient historians put into the mouths of their protagonists, as a succinct way to sum up.

==The ''Gospel of Truth''==
{{Main|Gospel of Truth}}
A new field in Valentinian studies opened when the [[Nag Hammadi library]] was discovered in Egypt in 1945. Among the very mixed bag of works classified as gnostic was a series of writings which could be associated with Valentinus, particularly the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] text called the ''[[Gospel of Truth]]''  which bears the same title reported by [[Irenaeus]] as belonging to a text by Valentinus.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'' 3.11.9.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a declaration of the unknown name of Jesus's divine father, the possession of which enables the knower to penetrate the veil of ignorance that has separated all created beings from said father. It furthermore declares that Jesus has revealed that name through a variety of modes laden with a language of abstract elements.  

This unknown name of the Father, mentioned in the Gospel of Truth, turns out to be not so mysterious.  It is in fact stated in the text: "The name of the Father is the Child."&lt;ref&gt;See The Gospel of Truth 23:1, Hal Taussig, ed., A New New Testament: A Bible for the Twenty-first Century (Boston-New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the overarching theme of the text is the revelation of the oneness of Christian believers with the "Father" through the "Son", leading to a new experience of life characterized by the words "fullness" and "rest".  The text's primary claim is that "since need came into being because the Father was not known, when the Father is known, from that moment on, need will no longer exist."&lt;ref&gt;See Gospel of Truth 10:11, Hal Taussig, ed., A New New Testament: A Bible for the Twenty-first Century (Boston-New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The tone is mystical and the language symbolic, reminiscent of the tone and themes found in the canonical Gospel of John.&lt;ref&gt;Compare GofT 1:1 with John 1; GofT 8:10 with John 3:7&amp;8; GofT 10:10 with John 17:21-23; GofT 10:11 with John 17:1-3; GofT 14:5 with John 15:1-6; GofT 16:7 with John 1; GofT 27:6 with John 14:10; GofT 27:8 with John 15:1-6; Hal Taussig, edl, A New New Testament (Boston-New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also very striking linguistic similarities with the early Christian songs known as the Odes of Solomon. &lt;ref&gt;Compare GofT 2:2 with Ode 16:18; GofT 2:8 with Ode 22:1; GofT 5:1 with Ode 3:6-8; GofT 5:2 with Ode 3:2; GofT 6:1 with Ode 23; GofT 6:11 with Ode 15:8; GofT 10:8 with Ode 19:1-5; GofT 10:12 with Ode 14:10;  GofT 21:8 with Ode11; GofT 21:9 with Ode 9:3; GofT 22:4-7 with Ode 24:8; GofT 23:8&amp;9 with Ode 26; GofT 23:10 with Ode 23:1-3; GofT 27:2 with Ode 19:1&amp;2; GofT 27:4 with Ode 3:5; Hal Taussig, ed. A New New Testament (Boston-New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  It notably lacks the unusual names for deities, emanations, or angels found in many other of the Nag Hammadi texts.  Its accessibility has led to a newfound popularity, evidenced by inclusion in such devotional compilations as ''A New New Testament.''&lt;ref&gt;Hal Taussig, ed., A New New Testament: A Bible for the Twenty-first Century (Boston-New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15104">'''Vivek Maru''' is an American social entrepreneur and human rights activist who is a pioneer in the field of global legal empowerment. He is currently the CEO of Namati: Innovations in Legal Empowerment, which he founded in 2011. Namati and its partners have built cadres of grassroots legal advocates – sometimes known as "community paralegals"– in ten countries. The advocates have worked with over 65,000 people to protect community lands, enforce environmental law, and secure basic rights to healthcare and citizenship.&lt;ref name="aba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/vivek_maru_drawing_the_arc_to_global_justice |title=Vivek Maru: Drawing the arc to global justice |website=Abajournal.com |date=2015-09-02 |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 article, Maru complained that "when world governments adopted development goals 15 years ago, law and justice were left out."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/feb/07/rough-justice-rules-in-developing-world|title=Law and disorder: rough justice rules in the developing world {{!}} Vivek Maru|last=Maru|first=Vivek|date=2014-02-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, while major progress has been made in the fields of health, education, and the reduction of poverty, access to law and justice has lagged behind. He asserted that all people should have the right to information about the laws and institutions they live under, the right to a legal identity, the right to have their property ownership respected, the right to participate in the shaping of laws and policies, and the right to a fair legal resolution of problems and conflicts.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Law and disorder: rough justice rules in the developing world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/feb/07/rough-justice-rules-in-developing-world|website=Theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Maru's parents were immigrants from [[India]]; his grandfather was a Gandhian who ran a small printing press.&lt;ref name="ashoka"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivek Maru|url=https://www.ashoka.org/fellow/vivek-maru|publisher=Ashoka|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maru attended [[Harvard College]] from 1993–97, receiving an A.B. in Social Studies. He graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'', was a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and was Class Marshal. His thesis was entitled "Mohandas, Martin, and Malcolm on Violence, Culture and Meaning."

From August 1997 to August 1998, he was a Frederick Sheldon Fellow at the Harvard University Extension School in western India, where he worked with grassroots rural-development organizations, taught classes, trained teachers, designed a curriculum, and conducted research.&lt;ref name="linkedin"&gt;{{cite web|title=LinkedIn Page|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-maru-25941b43|website=Linkedin.com|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in "a hut made of sticks and dung amid the poverty and pollution of India's Kutch region, from which his grandfather came." He "worked with grassroots organizations on watershed management and education for girls."&lt;ref name="aba" /&gt;

He attended Yale Law School from 1998 to 2001, receiving a Doctor of Law (JD).&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt; According to the ABA Journal, Maru nearly quit law school "because it wasn't presenting him with a Gandhian approach" to legal work.&lt;ref name="aba" /&gt; At Yale he was co-founder and director of the Umoja Education Program and a fellow of the Schell Center for Human Rights. He was also a Founding Team Member of the Amistad Academy Charter School.&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt;

==Career==
From August 2001 to August 2002, Maru served as law clerk for Federal Appellate Judge Marsha Berzon of the Ninth Circuit of Appeals in the [[San Francisco]] Bay Area.
 
Based in [[New York City]], he was a Finberg Fellow at Human Rights Watch from September 2002 to September 2003.&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt;

After Maru was invited by a friend, Simeon Koroma,&lt;ref name="open"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voices|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/reverence-and-transformation-qa-on-legal-empowerment-with-vivek-maru-of-namati|publisher=Open Society Foundation|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help Sierra Leone in the wake of its civil war, they co-founded Timap for Justice, which developed a nationwide network of paralegals at a time when there were only about 100 lawyers in the entire country, almost all of them in Freetown. "Paralegals working and living in the community can squeeze a lot of justice out of the system," Maru explained.&lt;ref name="aba" /&gt; Maru directed Timap from October 2003 to October 2007. During the same period he was also co-director of the Fourah Bay Human Rights Clinic in Freetown. In addition, he was a Sierra Leone-based consultant for the World Bank for four months in 2007.

Based in Washington, D.C., he was senior counsel for the World Bank's Justice Reform Group from November 2007 to August 2011, and director of the World Bank Justice for the Poor Program in Sierra Leone. During this period he directed a program on community paralegals in Indonesia, Philippines, South Africa, Kenya, and Sierra Leone, and created a global "Grassroots Justice Network" to link these programs. He also developed the World Bank's first global strategy for justice reform.

He is now CEO of Namati: Innovations in Legal Empowerment, which he founded in August 2011. It is an international organization that seeks to build a movement of grassroots legal advocates.&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt; Namati has 186 paralegals in [[Kenya]], [[Liberia]], [[Mozambique]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Uganda]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], and [[Myanmar]], who are part of a legal-empowerment network involving some 1,000 organizations. Matt Brown, a member of Namati's board, has said that "Vivek and Namati are creating a new field of legal empowerment."&lt;ref name="aba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt; The organization has received support from the British and Australian governments, the United Nations Development Program, and other funders. He called the organization Namati, a Sanskrit word meaning to shape something into a curve, because of Martin Luther King Jr.'s statement that the "arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."&lt;ref name="aba" /&gt;

Ashoka has distinguished Namati from other such efforts to provide community justice. While previous groups have worked alone and on a relatively small scale, have rarely documented the impact of their work, and haven't been in a position to learn lessons from the results of one another's work, Namati is a larger-scale activity that places emphasis on documenting its results and on enabling workers in the field to learn from one another about best practices. In 2014, Namati helped 700 Nubians in Kenya to acquire citizenship rights, resolves health-care problems in Sierra Leone and Mozambique, helped resolve violations of environmental law along the Indian coast, secured land-rights documentation for several thousand Burmese farmers, and helped dozens of communities in Liberia, Uganda, and Mozambique to win their land rights.&lt;ref name="ashoka" /&gt;

Namati convenes the Global Legal Empowerment Network, more than 1,000 groups from 150 countries who are learning from one another and collaborating on common challenges. This community successfully advocated for the inclusion of access to justice in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

==Honors and awards==
At Harvard, he won the Frederick Sheldon Fellowship, the Harvard Foundation Award for Advancing Intercultural and Race Relations, the Revival Undergraduate Prize, and the John Harvard Award for Academic Excellence.&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt;

He received the Pioneer Award from the North American South Asian Bar Association in 2008.&lt;ref name="namati1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://namati.org/people/vivek-maru/ |title=Vivek Maru |website=Namati.org |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he won the Professional Achievement Award from the Kutchi Jain Association of North America. In 2012 he won the Entrepreneur Award from the Connecticut Chapter of the Global Organization of People of Indian Origin.&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt;

He received the [[Ashoka]] Fellowship in 2014. In 2015, he was named an ABA 2015 Legal Rebel.
In 2016, he, Namati, and the Global Legal Empowerment Netowrk received 2016 [[Skoll]] Award for Social Entrepreneurship.&lt;ref name="ashoka" /&gt;&lt;ref name="namati1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recipient of Award|url=http://theunn.com/2016/04/vivek-maru-ceo-of-namati-named-recipient-of-skoll-foundation-awards/|website=Theunn.com|accessdate=19 May 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, the [[Schwab Foundation]] named Vivek and Sonkita Conteh, director of Namati – Sierra Leone, two of its Social Entrepreneurs of the Year.&lt;ref name="schwab"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://widgets.weforum.org/social-entrepreneurs-2017 |title=Meet the Schwab Foundation Social Entrepreneurs of the Year 2017 |website=widgets.weforum.org |date=2017-01-01 |accessdate=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
