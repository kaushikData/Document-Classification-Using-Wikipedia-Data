[[File:Abbots Bromley original hobby horse.jpg|thumb|The original medieval hobby horse, photographed in the mid-1970s. It has since been replaced by a more realistic carving]]
The '''Abbots Bromley Horn Dance''' is an English [[folk dance]] dating back to the Middle Ages. The dance takes place each year in [[Abbots Bromley]], a village in [[Staffordshire]], England. The modern version of the dance involves [[reindeer]] [[antlers]], a [[hobby horse]], [[Maid Marian]], and a Fool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abbots Bromley|url=http://www.abbotsbromley.com/horn_dance|accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There are no recorded references to the horn dance prior to [[Robert Plot]]'s ''Natural History of Staffordshire'', written in 1686. However, there is a record of the hobby horse being used in Abbots Bromley as early as 1532, and it is possible that the horn dance component of the custom was also present at that time but not commented upon by the writer.&lt;ref name=hutton2001/&gt; A [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon analysis]] discovered that the antlers used in the dance date to the 11th century – though these may well have replaced an even older set. According to some, the use of antlers suggests an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] origin along with other native Anglo-Saxon traditions that have survived into modern times in various forms.&lt;ref name=CAMPBELLANGLO&gt;Campbell, James. ''The Anglo-Saxons'' (1991) Page 241, with illustration. {{ISBN|0-14-014395-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated, for example, that the dance originated in the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan]] period and was connected with the ruling dynasty of [[Mercia]], based some 15 miles away at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], who owned extensive hunting lands in [[Needwood Forest]] and [[Cannock Chase]] surrounding Abbots Bromley. On this theory, the royal forester would have organised [[sympathetic magic]] rituals to ensure a plentiful catch each year, a tradition that survived into [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity|Christian]] times and gradually came to be seen as affirming the villagers' hunting rights. Even when the lands were granted to Burton Abbey in 1004 a forester would still need to have been employed. By the 16th century, when the abbey was dissolved, this was a hereditary position with the title "Forester of Bentylee" (Bentylee being the wooded area of the parish). From then until the 19th century the dance remained the traditional prerogative of the Bentley family, eventually passing to the Fowell family in 1914. The Fowells continue to run it to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''Water Witches'' (1998) pp. 114–116. {{ISBN|1-86163-049-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such an ancient origin for the dance has been doubted by some folklorists, who point out that while the reindeer antlers date to the 11th century, reindeer were long since extinct in England and Wales (and probably Scotland), and there is no evidence that any domestic reindeer herds remained at that time. Therefore, even more confusingly, the antlers must have been imported from Scandinavia at some point between the 11th and 17th centuries. This analysis may lend weight to the theory that the custom originally began with only a hobby horse, and the horn dance component was added later, explaining why only the former was mentioned by 16th century sources.&lt;ref name=hutton2001&gt;Hutton, R. (2001). ''The stations of the sun: a history of the ritual year in Britain.'' Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance was, like similar events throughout the country, temporarily discontinued during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] years.

==Event==
The Horn Dance attracts a large number of visitors to the village.  As well as the dance itself, [[Wakes week|Wakes Monday]] sees a fair on the village green; [[Morris dance|Morris dancing]]; and numerous other attractions. The right to hold this fair was granted to the village in 1221.

===Date and schedule of performance===
The Horn Dance takes place on Wakes Monday, the day following Wakes Sunday, which is the first Sunday after 4 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buckland|first=T.|year=2001|title=Dance, Authenticity and Cultural Memory: The Politics of Embodiment|journal=Yearbook for Traditional Music|issue=33|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Violet Alford]], a prominent student of folklore and folk dance, wrote in 1940 that the dance had previously taken place on the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Twelfth Day]], during the first week of January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alford|first=Violet|title=The Baccubert|journal=Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society|volume=4|issue=1|year=1940|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Plot, it has also been performed on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] and [[New Year's Day]], in addition to the local Wakes Monday, though upon its revival in 1660 it was confined to the latter alone.

The dance starts at 08:00 with a service of blessing in St Nicholas Church, where the horns are housed. The dance begins on the village green, then passes out of the village&amp;nbsp;– but not out of the parish&amp;nbsp;– to [[Blithfield Hall]], owned by Lady Bagot.

The dancers return to the village in the early afternoon, and make their way around the pubs and houses. Finally, at about 20:00, the horns are returned to the church, and the day is concluded with a service of [[Compline]].

===Dancers===
[[File:Abbots Bromley Horn Dance c1900 Stone.jpg|thumb|right|The dancers, c. 1900]]
There are 12 dancers. Six carry the horns and they are accompanied by a musician playing an accordion (a violin in former times), [[Maid Marian]] (a man in a dress), the [[hobby horse|Hobby-horse]], the Fool (or Jester), a youngster with a bow and arrow, and another youngster with a triangle. Traditionally, the dancers are all male, although in recent years girls have been seen carrying the triangle and bow and arrow.

Until the end of the 19th century the dancers were all members of the Bentley family. The dance passed to the related Fowell family in the early 20th century; this has continued to this day, though due to rising house prices none of them live in the village any longer; many live in nearby towns. They have been known to allow visitors to "dance in" if asked politely, and will often invite musicians and others to take part when necessary.

===Antlers===
The "horns" are six sets of [[reindeer]] antlers, three white and three black. In 1976, a small splinter was [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to around 1065. Since there are not believed to have been any reindeer in England in the 11th century, the horns must have been imported from [[Scandinavia]]. However, it is equally mysterious as to why this should have been done and by whom. If the antlers were imported it must have been near the date of their growth-dropping. It is, therefore, just as likely that reindeer did survive somewhere in England at that period.

The antlers are mounted on small heads carved from wood. Since 1981, the horns are legally the property of Abbots Bromley Parish Council. For 364 days a year, they are on display in St Nicholas Church. They were once kept in the main Village Hall, which is now the Goat's Head Inn, beside the [[Buttercross|Butter Cross]]. An alternative set of antlers ([[Red Deer|red deer]]) are kept to use when the dancers are asked, as they frequently are, to perform outside the parish boundaries.

===Dance===
[[File:Horn Dance, Blithfield Reservoir - 2006-09-11.jpg|thumb|right|The dance, above [[Blithfield Reservoir]] in 2006]]
The dance itself is simple, since the antlers themselves have some weight to them and are large and bulky.

As described by [[Cecil Sharp]], there are six figures in the dance. He describes the dance as being done with the participants in a single line; however, it is currently performed with the dancers in a double column.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">The [[Baluba]] are one of the [[Bantu peoples]] of [[Central Africa]].  Their creation deity's name is [[Kabezya-Mpungu]].

==Creation myth of Kabezya-Mpungu==

The Baluba creation story makes a connection between God's invisibility or unavailability, and the endowment of humans with a soul or divine component longing for God.

In the creation story, Kabezya-Mpungu decides to become invisible after creating the world and the first humans who did not yet have a heart.  After balancing the rain, sun, moon, and darkness, he leaves.  To replace the visible god, he sends the people Mutshima ("heart"), the life-giving or divine part of humans.

{{quote|..I don't want that humans will see me any more. I return into myself and send Mutshima...Then Kabeza-Mpungu disappeared. Thereafter, the heart appeared, in a small, hand-sized vessel. The heart cried and turned towards Sun, Moon, Darkness and Rain: "Kabezya-Mpungu, our father, where is he!" "Father is gone, we don't know the way he went". "Oh how much I am longing to see him" the heart replied, "to talk to him. Since I cannot find him, I will enter into this man. So I will wander from generation to generation"''.&lt;ref&gt;Cited according to the German version of the text from Carl Einstein's book. The German text reads: ''Ich will nicht, daß Menschen mich länger sehen. Ich kehre in mich zurück und sende Mutima...Darauf verschwand Kabezya-Mpungu. Es erschien darauf das Herz, in einem kleinen, handgroßen Gefäß. Das Herz schrie und wandte sich gen Sonne, Mond, Finsternis und Regen: "Kabezay-Mpungu, unser Vater, wo ist er!" "Vater ist fort, und wir kennen nicht den Weg, den er ging." "Gewaltig sehnte ich mich" erwiederte das Herz, "mit ihm zu sprechen. Da ich ihn nicht finden kann, trete ich in diesen Mann. So wandere ich von Geschlecht zu Geschlecht.'' For the English version of Charlotte and Wolf Leslau see external links.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since then all humans have been endowed with Mutshima, the heart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1903">The '''''Barnwell Chronicle''''' is a thirteenth-century Latin [[chronicle]] named after [[Barnwell Priory]], near [[Cambridge]], where the manuscript was kept. Its anonymous author is well-regarded by historians. [[J.C. Holt]] described the Chronicler as "The most intelligent and valuable" &lt;ref&gt;Holt, J.C. ''The Northerners: A Study in the Reign of King John''  Oxford University Press(1992) p9&lt;/ref&gt; and "perceptive" &lt;ref&gt;Holt, J.C. ''Magna Carta'' Cambridge University Press(1992)p223&lt;/ref&gt; writer of his time.

The Chronicler gives the fairest account of the reign of [[King John of England]] of any contemporaries&lt;ref&gt;Gransden, Antonia''Historical Writing in England: c. 500 to c. 1307'' Routledge (1976) p343&lt;/ref&gt; describing him as a "great prince". He indicates that John's reforms of 1213 were worthy of being remembered. The Chronicler disliked foreigners and regrets John's use of foreign mercenaries, blaming them for the initial failures against the French invasion in 1215.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden, Antonia ''Historical Writing in England: c. 500 to c. 1307''  Routledge (1976) p344&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicle implies John's failure was due to bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;Clanchy, M. T. ''England and its rulers, 1066-1272''  Blackwell 2nd edition (1998) p136&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chronicler also wrote of the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], regarding the struggle against the rebel barons as a crusade against infidels,&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter,David ''The minority of Henry III''  University of California Press (1990) p28&lt;/ref&gt; and commented upon the increasing French acculturation in [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniell, Christopher ''From Norman Conquest to Magna Carta: England, 1066-1215'' Routledge (2003) p60.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bibi Bimal Kaur''' (died 1990) was an Indian politician and the wife of [[Beant Singh (assassin)|Beant Singh]], one of the two assassins of [[Indira Gandhi]].

Bibi Bimal Kaur was a nurse at [[Lady Hardinge Medical College]] when her husband assassinated Indira Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preventgenocide.org/prevent/news-monitor/2003mar.htm Playing at Grown-Ups FEAR has been their childhood companion&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the assassination she was picked by the Indian security forces, she disappeared for several days leaving her children Amrit, Sarabjeet and Jassi at home. The [[Damdami Taksal]] paid for her children's education for two years.

Bimal Kaur was later arrested and imprisoned for two years for an incendiary speech in a [[gurdwara]]. In 1986, she led a rampaging group of militants attacking the guards at the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;SIKHS SOUGHT IN SLAYING, NYTimes 6 June 1986&lt;/ref&gt; A guard was killed and seven people were injured.

Later she was elected a member of [[Lok Sabha]] from [[Ropar]]. Her father-in-law, Beant Singh's father, Sucha Singh Maloa was a member of parliament&lt;ref&gt;Fighting for Faith and Nation: Dialogues with Sikh Militants By Cynthia Keppley Mahmood, p. 136 Published 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Sarbjit Singh, her son, was nominated by the SAD (A) headed by [[Simranjit Singh Mann]] to run for parliament from the  [[Bathinda]] and [[Mansa, Punjab|Mansa]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040228/punjab1.htm The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Punjab&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bimal Kaur's death is shrouded in mystery. The first reports that reached the press indicated that Bimal Khalsa consumed cyanide. As she had small children, the suspicion immediately arose that she had been forcibly administered cyanide. Subsequently, this story was "corrected" by the police and it was given out that she had died by electrocution while using a washing machine. A 13-year-old servant normally did this work but this boy was not in the house at the time of her death. Her nearest relative demanded a post-mortem which, under normal circumstances, the police was bound to conduct on request but the police refused this. She died on 2 September 1990.

'''''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities''''' is an English language [[encyclopedia]] first published in 1842. The second, improved and enlarged, edition appeared in 1848, and there were many revised editions up to 1890. The encyclopedia covered law, religion, architecture, warfare, daily life, and similar subjects primarily from the standpoint of a [[Classics|classicist]]. It was one of a series of reference works on [[classical antiquity]] by [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], the others cover persons and places. It runs to well over a million words in any edition, and all editions are now in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities: Introduction|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA/|publisher=LacusCurtius|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eel]]s are elongated fish, ranging in length from {{convert|5|cm|in}} to {{convert|4|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N. |author= McCosker, John F. |year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 86–90|isbn = 0-12-547665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults range in weight from 30 grams to over 25 kilograms. They possess no [[pelvic fin]]s, and many species also lack [[pectoral fin]]s. The [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[anal fin]]s are fused with the [[caudal fin|caudal]] or tail fin, forming a single ribbon running along much of the length of the animal.&lt;ref name=FB&gt;{{FishBase order|order=Anguilliformes|year=2009|month=January}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most eels live in the shallow waters of the [[ocean]] and burrow into sand, mud, or amongst rocks.  A majority of eel species are nocturnal and thus are rarely seen.  Sometimes, they are seen living together in holes, or "eel pits". Some species of eels live in deeper water on the continental shelves and over the slopes deep as {{convert|4000|m|ft}}. Only members of the [[Anguillidae]] family regularly inhabit fresh water, but they too return to the sea to breed.&lt;ref name=EoG&gt;{{cite book |author= Prosek, James |year=2010|title=Eels|publisher= HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn = 978-0-06-056611-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eel blood is poisonous to humans&lt;ref&gt;"Poison in the Blood of the Eel", New York Times, 9 April 1899, viewed at [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/04/09/100439047.pdf], accessed 22 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and other mammals,&lt;ref&gt;"The plight of the eel", BBC online, as seen at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/content/articles/2006/12/19/angling_eels_feature.shtml], accessed 22 January 2010, mentions that "Only 0.1ml/kg is enough to kill small mammals, such as a rabbit..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Blood serum of the eel." M. Sato. Nippon Biseibutsugakukai Zasshi (1917), 5 (No. 35), From: Abstracts Bact. 1, 474 (1917)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hemolytic and toxic properties of certain serums." Wm. J. Keffer, Albert E. Welsh. Mendel Bulletin (1936), 8 76-80.&lt;/ref&gt; but both cooking and the digestive process destroy the toxic protein.  The toxin derived from eel blood serum was used by [[Charles Richet]] in his Nobel winning research which discovered [[anaphylaxis]] (by injecting it into dogs and observing the effect).

The Jewish laws of [[Kashrut]] forbid the eating of eels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/chapter1.html Yoreh De'ah - Shulchan-Aruch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603170414/http://www.torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/chapter1.html |date=2012-06-03 }} Chapter 1, ''torah.org''. Retrieved 17 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to the King James version of the Old Testament, it is acceptable to eat [[fin fish]], but fish like eels, which were erroneously believed to lack fins or scales, are [[Abomination (Bible)|an abomination]] and should not be eaten.&lt;ref&gt;"All that are in the waters: all that... hath not fins and scales ye may not eat" ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+14%3A9-10&amp;version=KJV Deuteronomy 14:9-10]) and are "an abomination" ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11%3A9-12&amp;version=KJV Leviticus 11:9-12]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan consumes more than 70 percent of the global eel catch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/07/29/national/indonesia-eel-hot-item-for-smugglers/#.Ufcwixb1s08|title=Indonesia eel hot item for smugglers|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of food==
Freshwater eels (''[[unagi]]'') and marine eels (''[[anago fish|anago]]'', [[conger eel]]) are commonly used in [[Japanese cuisine]]; foods such as [[unadon]] and [[unajuu]] are popular but expensive.  Eels are also very popular in [[Chinese cuisine]] and are prepared in many different ways. [[Hong Kong]] eel prices have often reached 1000 [[HKD]] per kilogram and once exceeded 5000 HKD per kilogram.  Eel is also popular in [[Korean cuisine]] and is seen as a source of stamina for men.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The [[European eel]] and other freshwater eels are eaten in [[Europe]], the [[United States]], and other places. Traditional east London foods are [[jellied eels]] and [[pie and mash]], although their demand has significantly declined since World War II. In [[Italian cuisine]] eels from the [[Valli di Comacchio]], a swampy zone along the [[Adriatic]] coast, are especially prized along with freshwater eels of [[Bolsena Lake]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Sustainability ==
In 2010, [[Greenpeace International]] added the [[American eel]], [[European eel]], and [[Japanese eel]] to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703000000/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=July 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The eel was a cheap, nutritious and readily available food source for the people of London; European eels were once so common in the [[River Thames|Thames]] that nets were set as far upriver as London itself, and eels became a [[staple food|staple]] for London's poor. The first "Eel Pie &amp; Mash Houses" opened in London in the 18th century, and the oldest surviving shop - M Manze - has been open since 1902.&lt;ref name='East End Food &amp; Drink'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visiteastlondon.co.uk/business/factsheets/Food%20and%20Drink.doc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026063140/http://www.visiteastlondon.co.uk/business/factsheets/Food%20and%20Drink.doc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-26 |title=FACT SHEET - East End Food &amp; Drink |accessdate=2008-12-11 |format=Doc |work=VisitEastLondon.co.uk |publisher=VisitEastLondon.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{lang|es|Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español|italic=no}}''' ({{lang-en|Universal Free Encyclopedia in Spanish}}) is a [[Spanish language]] [[wiki]] [[encyclopedia]], released under the [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License&amp;nbsp;3.0]]. It uses the [[MediaWiki]] software. It started as a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[Spanish Wikipedia]].

==History==
The {{lang|es|Enciclopedia Libre|italic=no}} was founded by contributors to the [[Spanish Wikipedia|Spanish-language Wikipedia]] who decided to start an independent project.  Led by Edgar Enyedy, they left Wikipedia on 26 February 2002, and created the new website, provided by the [[University of Seville]] for free, with the freely licensed articles of the Spanish-language Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Nathaniel Tkacz|Tkacz]]|first=[[Nathaniel Tkacz|Nathaniel]]|title=The Spanish Fork: Wikipedia's ad-fuelled mutiny|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-01/20/wikipedia-spanish-fork|newspaper=Wired UK|date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for the split are explained on Enciclopedia Libre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enciclopedia.us.es/index.php/Enciclopedia:Por_qué_estamos_aquí_y_no_en_es.wikipedia.org Enciclopedia: Por qué estamos aquí y no en es.wikipedia.org] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key issues included concerns about censorship and the possibility of advertising on Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="thewikipediarevolution9"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lih|first1=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Lih|title=[[The Wikipedia Revolution: How a Bunch of Nobodies Created the World's Greatest Encyclopedia]]|date=2009|publisher=Aurum|location=London|isbn=9781845134730|oclc=280430641|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the interview with Edgar Enyedy,&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-01/20/wikipedia-spanish-fork Nathaniel Tkacz (2011)] The Spanish Fork: Wikipedia's ad-fuelled mutiny&lt;/ref&gt; the main reasons for splitting at that time were:
* Perceived expectation that Wikipedia would soon start hosting advertisements.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;
* Non-English Wikipedias were running older, less featured versions of [[MediaWiki]]. When national groups offered help in software development and maintenance, access to the servers was denied.
* The downloadable database dumps of Wikipedia content were highly outdated.
* Wikipedia was hosted on a [[.com]] rather than a [[.org]] domain.

==Post-split history==
In 2011, Enyedy said that the sole reason for the failure of {{lang|es|Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español|italic=no}} as a long term project was because it "was not intended to last. It was merely a form of pressure. Some of the goals were achieved, not all of them, but it was worth the cost."&lt;ref name=Tkacz2&gt;Tkacz, Nathaniel. "The Spanish Fork: Wikipedia's ad-fuelled mutiny." ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''. 20 January 2011. p. [https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-01/20/wikipedia-spanish-fork/page/2 2]. Retrieved on 26 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Enyedy said "Nowadays, the romantic point of view is that EL survived and is still going strong."&lt;ref name=Tkacz2/&gt; He argued that while the viewpoint is positive, it is not factual.&lt;ref name=Tkacz2/&gt;

==Statistics==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
While {{lang|es|Enciclopedia Libre|italic=no}} initially grew much more rapidly than the Spanish Wikipedia, the Spanish Wikipedia overtook it in 2004. Since then, the Spanish Wikipedia has grown at a much greater rate. As of December 2016, the Spanish Wikipedia hosts approximately twenty-six times as many articles as Enciclopedia Libre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4356">'''English Men of Letters''' was a series of [[Biography in literature|literary biographies]] written by leading literary figures of the day and published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], under the general editorship of [[John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn|John Morley]]. The original series was launched in 1878, with [[Leslie Stephen]]'s biography of [[Samuel Johnson]], and ran until 1892. A second series, again under the general editorship of Morley, was published between 1902 and 1919. David Amigoni has argued that nineteenth-century projects such as the 63-volume ''Dictionary of National Biography'' (1885-1900) and ''English Men of Letters'' revealed a ‘powerful tradition of biographical pedagogic initiatives’ which was also rhetorical and ideological in character (2014: 21).

The '''''Epistula Mithridatis''''' ({{lang-la|"Letter of Mithridates"}}), also known as the '''Letter of Mithridates to King Arsaces''', is a letter allegedly written by [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] king [[Phraates III of Parthia|Phraates III]] ({{Reign}}70–57 BC).{{sfn|Adler|2011|page=17}}{{efn|In the letter Sallust refers to Phraates as [[Arsaces]].{{sfn|Adler|2011|page=216}}}} The letter was discovered "among a collection of [[Sallust]]ian speeches and letters probably originally produced in the first or second centuries A.D".{{sfn|Adler|2011|page=17}}{{efn|According to Adler, this means that the context of the letter "is wholly lost to us".{{sfn|Adler|2011|page=17}}}} In the letter, Mithridates requests Parthian aid against the troops of [[Lucullus]],{{efn|Sallust had Mithridates "most likely" write the letter after the [[Battle of Tigranocerta]].{{sfn|Adler|2011|pages=17, 216}}}} and in a series of arguments, Mithridates asks the Parthians to join an alliance with Mithridates and [[Tigranes the Great|Tigranes]] (king of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]]), against the [[Roman Republic|Romans]].{{sfn|Adler|2011|page=17}} The letter, assigned to Sallust, is considered to be an important source on the Pontic–Parthian relations at the time.{{sfn|Adler|2011|page=17}}{{sfn|Olbrycht|2009|page=178}}

According to Prof. Dr. Marek Jan Olbrycht, the letter suggests "a genuine document found by the Romans in the personal archives of Mithridates".{{sfn|Olbrycht|2009|page=178}} According to Dr. Eric Adler (associate professor), the composition of the letter by Sallust, is largely the result of his own invention.{{sfn|Adler|2011|page=17}} Adler states that "A few scholars have asserted that the ''EM'' (''Epistula Mithridatis'') owes its origin to a document culled from the archives of Mithridates, which Sallust somehow acquired and translated or adapted into Latin. Some claim that [[Pompey]] discovered this [[epistle]] in a secret archive after the [[Third Mithridatic War]], and then presumably brought to Rome. Others have supposed that the ''EM'' is an expression of authentic Pontic propaganda, and thus based on arguments that are not Sallust's own. (...) We can be reasonably certain, then, that the ''EM'' is the creation of Sallust and is the product of a Roman historian's attempt to reconstruct the likely arguments of an anti-Roman Eastern king".{{sfn|Adler|2011|pages=17–18}}

'''''Excerpta Latina Barbari''''' ("Excerpts in Bad Latin") is a [[Latin]] translation of a 5th or early 6th century Greek chronicle. 

==Origin==

The ''Excerpta Latina Barbari'' is a Latin translation of a Greek chronicle composed in [[Alexandria]] during the reign of [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] (474-491) or [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]] (491-518).&lt;ref&gt;Joh. Jos. Hoeveler, Die Excerpta Latini Barbari, Festschrift der dreiundvierzigsten Versammlung deutscher Philologen und Schulmanner, Bonn, 1895, pp. 193-214; Theodor Mommsen, Chronica Minora, p. 184(= Monumenta germaniae historica; Auctorum antiqyissimorum) tomus ix; Berlin, 1892, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;
The original Greek chronicle was a variation of the ''Chronica Alexandrina''.&lt;ref&gt;Frick. Chronica minora. 1892. p. 330; f. 48b. cf. his introduction. p. lxxxvii ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into Latin c. 750 by an anonymous [[Merovingian]] author. &lt;ref&gt;It was originally dated to the 7th century (MGH AA IX, p. 83, 249; Frick, Chronica [n.57], p.ccxi), but is now assigned to the mid-8th  (Loew, CL.A V, no.560; Porcher, in Karl der Grosse, Dusseldorf, 1967. III p. 59f n. 19; Bischoff. Mittel-alterlichen Studien, Stuttgart, 1966, I p. 60).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Excerpta Latina Barbari'' derives its name from the fact that the late Merovingian translator made many mistakes in translating the Greek into Latin. It is also now known that the translator included some alterations to the original chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;"Studies in Eusebian and post-Eusebian chronography", Richard W. Burgess, Witold Witakowski, Franz Steiner Verlag, 1999, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; These alterations include the insertion of a lineage linking the Merovingian kings to the ancient [[Troy|Trojans]] (see [[Francus]]) as popularised in the ''[[Liber historiae Francorum]]''.

[[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] took the first scholarly interest in the chronicle in his ''Thesaurus temporum'' (1606) and first named the chronicle ''Barbarus Scaligeri''. This subsequently became ''Excerpta Latina Barbari'' because of the translator's bad conversion Greek into Latin. Some modern scholars have criticized this name, but it remains in use.&lt;ref&gt;'Menelaos' in the Spartan Agiad King-List, R. Ball, The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 27, No. 2, 1977, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 8th-century manuscript of the Latin version of the text is now housed in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].

==Contents==

The chronicle contains two main sections: (a) the history of the world from the creation to [[Cleopatra]] and (b) a list of kings or rulers from Assyria to the consuls of Rome (including the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], a list entitled "high priests and kings of the Jews" and an entry for Macedonian kings). The king's lists start by including some mythological kings, for example the entry for Assyrian rulers starts from [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]] dated c. 2206 BC.&lt;ref&gt;The Assyrian King list in the ''Excerpta Latina Barbari'' claims Belus ruled 1430 years before the first [[Olympiad]] (776 BC) thus dating him to 2206 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menelaus]] is also considered a historical king of [[Sparta]].

'''''Funny Games''''' is a 1997 Austrian [[psychological thriller]] film written and directed by [[Michael Haneke]]. The plot of the film involves two young men who hold a family hostage and [[torture]] them with [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] games. The film was entered into the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4807/year/1997.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Funny Games |accessdate=21 September 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710235317/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4807/year/1997.html |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 it was [[Funny Games (2007)|remade]] in America by Haneke, this time with a different cast and a mostly American crew.

==Development==
Haneke wanted to make a film set in the United States, but for practical reasons he had to set it in Austria.&lt;ref name=CineasteFG&gt;Koehler, Robert. "[http://www.cineaste.com/articles/funny-games.htm Funny Games]." ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131002065215/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/funny-games.htm Archive]) ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]''. Retrieved on 12 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Funny Games (2007 film)|2007 American remake]] directed by Haneke used the same house including props and tones, Robert Koehler of ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' wrote that this "proves for certain that—whether he uses the great cinematographer {{Interlanguage link multi|Jürgen Jürges|de}} (for the 1997 version) or the great [[Darius Khondji]] (for the new film)—Haneke is fundamentally his own cinematographer exercising considerable control over the entire look of his films."&lt;ref name=CineasteFG/&gt;

==Plot==
The film begins with a wealthy Austrian family—Georg, his wife Anna, their son Georgie, and their dog Rolfi—arriving at their holiday home beside a lake in Austria. They spot their next-door neighbor Fred accompanied by two young [[Vienna|Viennese]] men, Peter and Paul, one of whom Fred introduces as the son of a friend.

The two men begin imposing themselves on the family's courtesy.  First Peter asks to borrow eggs which he keeps breaking, supposedly by accident, also destroying the family's phone with his apparent clumsiness. Eventually, a frustrated Anna demands that the men leave, asking Georg to eject them from the premises.  Peter breaks Georg's leg with the latter's golf club while Paul reveals he has killed Rolfi, and the two men take the family hostage, forcing the members to participate in games of pain and death.

Paul asks if the family wants to bet whether they will still be alive by 9:00 the next morning, though he doubts that they will win. Between playing their games, the two men keep up a constant patter, and Paul frequently ridicules Peter's weight and lack of intelligence. He relates contradictory stories of Peter's past. No definitive explanation of the men's origins or motives is offered. When some of the family's other neighbors arrive for a visit, Anna passes the men off as friends until the visitors leave—much in the same way Fred did at the beginning of the film. Georgie eventually escapes to the house next door, but finds the family dead. He attempts to shoot Paul with a [[shotgun]], but it is not loaded. Paul returns him to the house, along with the gun. After a few more games, Peter plays a [[counting-out game]] between the family members and shoots Georgie while Paul makes sandwiches in the kitchen. After this, both intruders leave.

Georg and Anna weep for their loss, but eventually resolve to survive. Anna flees the house while Georg, with a broken leg, tries to get help with the malfunctioning phone. Anna struggles to find help, but eventually Peter and Paul reappear, capture her, and return to the house. They kill Georg and take Anna out on the family's boat early the next morning. Around 8:00, Paul casually throws the bound Anna into the water to drown, thus winning their bet. They knock at the house of the neighbors that had previously visited the family, and ask for some eggs, thereby restarting their cycle of murder.

==Cast==
*[[Susanne Lothar]] as Anna 
*[[Ulrich Mühe]] as George
*Stefan Clapczynski as George Jr.
*[[Arno Frisch]] as Paul
*[[Frank Giering]] as Peter
*[[Christoph Bantzer]] as Fred
*Doris Kunstmann as Gerda
*[[Wolfgang Glück]] as Robert

==Themes==
The film frequently blurs the line between fiction and reality, especially highlighting the act of observation. The character Paul [[breaking the fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] throughout the film and addresses the camera in various ways. As he directs Anna to look for her dead dog, he turns, winks, and smirks at the camera. When he asks the family to bet on their survival, he turns to the camera and asks the audience whether they will bet as well. At the end of the film, when requesting eggs from the next family, he looks into the camera and smirks again. Only Paul breaks the fourth wall in the film, while Peter makes references to the formulaic suspense rules of traditional cinema throughout the film.

Paul also frequently states his intentions to follow the standards of movie plot development. When he asks the audience to bet, he guesses that the audience wants the family to win. After the killers vanish in the third act, Paul later explains that he had to give the victims a last chance to escape or else it would not be dramatic. Toward the end of the movie, he postpones killing the rest of the family because the movie has not yet reached [[feature length]]. Throughout the film, Paul shows awareness of the audience's expectations.

However, Paul also causes the film to go against convention on a number of occasions. In thrillers, [[Final girl|one protagonist that the audience can sympathize with]] usually survives, but here all three family members die. When Anna successfully shoots Peter, as a possible start to a heroic escape for the family, Paul uses a remote control to rewind the film itself and prevent her action. After Peter shoots Georgie, Paul scolds him for killing the child first because it goes against convention and limits the suspense for the rest of the film. At the end of the film, the murderers prevent Anna from using a knife in the boat to cut her bonds. An earlier [[close-up]] had pointed out the knife's location as a possible set-up for a final-act escape, but this becomes a [[Red herring (plot device)|red herring]]. At the end of the film, Paul again smirks triumphantly at the audience. As a self-aware character, he is able to go against the viewers' wishes and make himself the winner of the film.

After killing Anna, Peter and Paul argue about the line between reality and fiction. Paul believes that a fiction that is observed is just as real as anything else, but Peter dismisses this idea. Unlike Paul, Peter never shows an awareness that he is in a film.

Haneke states that the entire film was not intended to be a [[horror film]]. He says he wanted to make a message about violence in the media by making an incredibly violent, but otherwise pointless movie. He had written a short essay revealing how he felt on the issue, called "Violence + Media." The essay is included as a chapter  in the book ''A Companion to Michael Haneke.''&lt;ref&gt;Haneke, Michael (2010). "Violence and the Media". In Roy Grundmann (Ed.), A Companion to Michael Haneke, pp. 575–579. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-8800-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
Austrian critics argued that the intention was to undermine the [[heimatfilm|heimat]] genre and its values, which are bourgeois and based on the home. European and English-language critics, according to Robert Koehler of ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'', "generally set their criticism against the backdrop of the American [[slasher movie]] that the film was subverting" and "expressed mild forms of outrage along with admiration".&lt;ref name=CineasteFG/&gt; In an interview, the film director and critic [[Jacques Rivette]] made his displeasure with the movie clear, calling it "a disgrace", "vile", and "a complete piece of shit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2001/french-cinema-present-and-past/rivette-2/ |title=The Captive Lover - An Interview with Jacques Rivette|accessdate=7 November 2014 |publisher=Senses of Cinema | first=Frédéric | last=Bonnaud | date=25 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Funny Games'' received generally positive reviews, garnering a 64%, based an average score of 6.8/10 by 28 critics, on [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The site's critical consensus states: "Violent images and blunt audience provocation make up this nihilistic experiment from one of cinema's more difficult filmmakers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1083791-funny_games/|title=Funny Games|date=11 March 1998|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Tu Qui Santuzza" ([[Pietro Mascagni]]) &amp;mdash; from ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]''

'''GreatSchools''' is a [[United States]] national nonprofit organization that provides parents with information about [[PK-12]] schools and education. The website provides ratings based on test scores and a variety of other factors for schools in all 50 states, including tools for finding, evaluating, comparing, saving and following schools. {{As of|2017|July}}, the GreatSchools database contains information on over 138,000 public, private, and charter schools in the United States.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The GreatSchools website includes guides to the [[Common Core]], parenting advice and articles on children's brain development and social emotional learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=GreatSchools Site Partners With Yale Scholars on 'Emotional Intelligence'|date=June 24, 2015|first=|last=|url=https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/greatschools_site_partners_with_yale_scholars_on_emotional_intelligence/|publisher=Editorial Projects in Education, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can also review their children's schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nonprofit designs school index for low-income, minority parents|date=February 9, 2016|first=|last=|url=https://edsource.org/2016/nonprofit-designs-school-index-for-low-income-minority-parents/94564|publisher=EdSource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
GreatSchools was founded in 1998 as a school directory and parenting resource in [[Santa Clara County]], with seed funding from New Schools Venture Fund. The next four years (1999–2002), the school ratings expanded statewide in [[California]]. In 2003, the main school guide resource expanded nationwide. In 2008–2011 was the launch of College Bound Program, funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], the Robertson Foundation and the [[Walton Family Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=How Can Schools Best Communicate with Immigrant Parents?|date=June 14, 2012|first=|last=|url=https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2012/06/14/how-can-schools-best-communicate-with-immigrant-parents/|publisher=KQED}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 GreatSchools received a three-year grant from the [[Walton Family Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Walton Family Foundation Invests $7.5 Million in GreatSchools to Reach 45 Million Users With Information on School Quality|date=March 13, 2013|first=|last=|url=http://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/newsroom/greatschools-to-reach-45-million-users-with-information-on-school-quality|publisher=Walton Family Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 saw [[Zillow]] integrate GreatSchools information such as school search, school ratings and reviews into their real estate database.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Zillow Launches New Schools Search Tool; Allows Shoppers to Search in Multiple School Areas Simultaneously|date=September 12, 2013|first=|last=|url=http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2013-09-12-Zillow-Launches-New-Schools-Search-Tool-Allows-Shoppers-to-Search-in-Multiple-School-Areas-Simultaneously|publisher=Zillow}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2014 included an expanded partnership with [[Maponics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Maponics Adds GreatSchools Ratings and Reviews As Partnership Grows|date=January 10, 2014|first=|last=|url=http://www.maponics.com/about-us/news-events/press-releases/maponics-adds-greatschools-ratings-and-reviews-as-partnership-grows|publisher=Maponics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equity and Academic Progress Controversy==
In 2017 GreatSchools began using proprietary ratings called Equity and Academic Progress in addition to test scores to calculate schools' overall ratings. Schools with a small population of disadvantaged students were given an arbitrary Equity rating. The change had the effect of lowering the rating for many highly rated schools and raising ratings for poorly performing schools. The change has been a subject of considerable controversy with parents and teachers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7910">The '''International Federation of Film Archives''' ({{lang-fr|Fédération internationale des archives du film}}, '''FIAF''') was founded in [[Paris]] in 1938 by the [[Cinémathèque Française]], the [[Reichsfilmarchiv]] in [[Berlin]], the [[British Film Institute]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Laurent Mannoni, ''Histoire de la Cinémathèque française'' (Paris: Gallimard, 2006); Haidee Wasson, ''Museum movies: The Museum of Modern Art and the birth of art cinema'' (Berkeley, Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2005); Christophe Dupin, "The origins and early development of the National Film Library: 1929-1936", ''Journal of Media Practice'', 7.3, 2006; Rolf Aurich, "Cinéaste, collector, National Socialist: Frank Hensel and the Reichsfilmarchiv", ''Journal of Film Preservation'', 64, April 2002; [http://www.fiafnet.org/pages/History/Origins-of-FIAF.html?PHPSESSID=voma5qc668bdst9st2o63l0gk3 Christophe Dupin: The origins of FIAF, 1936-1938].&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:FIAF logo.jpg|thumb|Former FIAF logo]]
[[File:FIAF logo from 1 January 2015.jpg|thumb|FIAF logo from January 2015]]

FIAF brings together the world's leading institutions in the field of moving picture heritage.
Its affiliates describe themselves as "the defenders of the twentieth century's own art form". They are dedicated to the rescue, collection, preservation and screening of moving images, which are valued both as works of art and culture and as historical documents. As of May 2017, it comprises 164 film heritage institutions in 75 countries - a reflection of the extent to which preservation of moving image heritage has become a world-wide concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiafnet.org/pages/Community/Mission-FIAF.html FIAF's Mission].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims ==
* to uphold a code of ethics for film preservation and practical standards for all areas of film archive work
* to promote the creation of moving image archives in countries which lack them
* to seek the improvement of the legal context within which film archives carry out their work
* to promote film culture and facilitate historical research on both a national and international level
* to foster training and expertise in preservation and other archive techniques
* to ensure the permanent availability of material from the collections for study and research by the wider community
* to encourage the collection and preservation of documents and materials relating to the cinema
* to develop cooperation between members and "to ensure the international availability of films and documents".

== Affiliates ==
FIAF's members are archives that are actively engaged in the activities and fully committed to the ideals described earlier. Current members reflect a wide range of non-profit institutions, including government archives, independent foundations and trusts, self-contained cinematheques, and museum or university departments.

FIAF's Associates are non-profit institutions that support the goals of the Federation but are not involved in film preservation per se. In this way, FIAF is joined by moving image museums, videotheques, documentation centres, and so on.

== Activities ==
[[File:FIAF MANIFESTO.jpg|thumb|FIAF Manifesto: "Don't Throw Film Away"]]
Much of the work of FIAF takes the form of active cooperation between members on projects of mutual benefit or interest - for example, the careful restoration of a particular film, or the compilation of a national or international filmography. The more visible activities include the annual congress, publications and the work of the specialist commissions.

'''The Annual Congress'''
FIAF meets every year in a different country. The Congress combines a General Assembly at which the formal business of the Federation is transacted with a programme of symposia and workshops on technical or legal aspects of film archive work and on aspects of film history and culture.

'''The Specialized Commissions'''
The Commissions are groups of individual experts from affiliated archives who meet regularly to pursue work programmes that promote and assist in the development and maintenance of standards at both the theoretical and the practical level. The three FIAF Commissions are the Cataloguing and Documentation Commission, the Technical Commission, and the Programming and Access to Collections Commission.

== Publications ==
FIAF publishes the ''[[Journal of Film Preservation]]'' twice a year. A special office compiles and publishes the International Index to Film Periodicals and the FIAF International FilmArchive Database. Publications also include an annual bibliography of members' publications, the proceedings of symposia or workshops, the results of surveys and reports, manuals and discussion papers prepared by the specialist Commissions and the results of other FIAF projects.

* [http://www.fiafnet.org/pages/Publications/About-the-FBO.html ''FIAF Bulletin Online'']

== Relations with international organisations ==
FIAF has always had an active international profile. It was closely involved in the preparatory work for the [[UNESCO]] Recommendation for the Safeguarding and Preservation of Moving Images, approved in Belgrade in 1980. In pursuit of the goals of the Recommendation, the Federation facilitates contacts between developing archives and older archives to make sure that experience is passed on. The Federation is a member of the [[Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations]] (CCAAA).

== Education ==
Training of archive personnel takes place at FIAF Summer Schools and Technical Symposia that have been held several times in various countries. Their aim is to introduce participants to the necessary skills of preservation, cataloguing, documentation and even administration.

== FIAF Award ==
[[File:2011 FIAF Award.jpg|thumb|2011 FIAF Award]]
The FIAF Award celebrates a personality – external to the FIAF archival community – whose experience in the field of cinema underlines the objectives and goals of the Federation.

The FIAF Award was created in 2001, and has since then been presented to the following personalities:
* [[Martin Scorsese]] (2001)
* [[Manoel de Oliveira]] (2002)
* [[Ingmar Bergman]] (2003)
* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] (2004)
* [[Mike Leigh]] (2005)

[[Jack Reacher]] is a fictional [[protagonist]] of a series of novels, novellas and short stories by British author Jim Grant under the pen name [[Lee Child]].&lt;ref name=CurtisMarch2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Bryan|title=The Curious Case of Lee Child: Before Tom Cruise could become Jack Reacher, Jim Grant had to become Lee Child|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8766396/lee-child-jim-grant-jack-reacher |magazine=[[Grantland]] (20 December) | accessdate=5 September 2015|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former major in the [[United States Army Military Police Corps]], Reacher roams the United States taking odd jobs and investigating suspicious and frequently dangerous situations. The Reacher novels are written either in the [[First-person narrative|first-person]] or [[Third-person narrative|third-person]].  The schedule for the Reacher series, previously one-per-year, was increased in 2010 with the release of both ''61 Hours'' and ''Worth Dying For''. Most of the novels are set in the United States, in locales ranging from major metropolitan areas like New York City and Los Angeles to small towns in the Midwestern and Southern United States. To date, Reacher's travels outside the US have taken him to rural England (''[[The Hard Way (novel)|The Hard Way]]''), London (''[[Personal (novel)|Personal]]''), Hamburg (''[[Night School (novel)|Night School]]'') and Paris, France, where Reacher and his brother visit their dead mother's grave.

==Short stories and novellas==
Reacher has also appeared in several short stories by Child. "[[Second Son (Lee Child novel)|Second Son]]," "[[Deep Down (short story)|Deep Down]]" and "Not a Drill" were all released originally for the [[Amazon Kindle]] although "Second Son" was later included in the American &amp; Canadian paperback and Kindle editions of ''The Affair'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leechild.com/stories/second-son-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131118191246/http://www.leechild.com/stories/second-son-2/ |archivedate=2013-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Deep Down" with the American &amp; Canadian paperback and Kindle editions of ''A Wanted Man''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leechild.com/stories/deep-down/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928132638/http://www.leechild.com/stories/deep-down/ |date=28 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "High Heat" with the American paperback and Kindle editions of ''Never Go Back'', "Everyone Talks" with the UK edition of ''Never Go Back'', and "Not a Drill" with the American paperback of ''Personal''.

==="Second Son"===
"Second Son" is a snapshot of the life of Reacher and his family circa 1974, while they are stationed on a [[military base]] in [[Okinawa]]. Upon arriving they immediately get into deep trouble that is compounded by some bad news. The action is interspersed with contemplative moments, such as when 13-year-old Jack's grandfather, a prosthetic-limb maker and [[World War I]] veteran in Paris, recounts that "… a great war leaves a country with three armies: an army of cripples, an army of mourners, and an army of thieves."

==="Deep Down"===
In 1986, summoned by [[military intelligence]] to Washington, DC, Reacher is sent [[undercover]]. The assignment that awaits him: the army is meeting with its [[Capitol Hill]] paymasters for classified talks on a new, state-of-the-art sniper rifle for US forces. But vital details about the weapon are leaking from someone at the top of the federal government and probably into the hands of unidentified foreign [[arms dealer]]s. The prospect of any and every terrorist, mercenary, or dictator's militia getting their hands on the latest superior firepower is unthinkable. Reacher is tasked with infiltrating the top-secret proceedings and revealing the traitor. He targets a quartet of high-powered Army political liaison officers—all of them fast-track women on their way to the top. According to his bosses, it's a zero-danger mission, but Reacher knows that things are rarely what they seem.

==="Guy Walks into a Bar"===
The story is set in the moments before the beginning of the novel ''Gone Tomorrow''.  Reacher, while at a [[blues]] music club, observes what he believes to be the beginning of a kidnapping as part of a [[Russian mafia]] dispute.  This story was published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 6 June 2009.

==="James Penney's New Identity"===
The story features Reacher, still in the Army as a captain, helping James Penney, a [[Vietnam War]] veteran who has recently been made redundant at work and had his car stolen.  When Penney unknowingly becomes a fugitive (after he accidentally burns down two neighbours' houses in the course of deliberately burning down his own in an act of frustration after being fired), Reacher helps Penney obtain a new identity so he can start a new life.  The story has appeared in ''Fresh Blood 3'' (1999), an anthology of mystery short stories edited by Mike Ripley and [[Maxim Jakubowski]],&lt;ref&gt;Child, Lee (1999). "James Penney's New Identity," In [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1899344527 ''Fresh Blood III (Bloodlines)''], 163, (M.

He drives off the man after a small scuffle, only to learn that the man is Croselli, one of the mob bosses of New York City. Croselli had slapped Hemingway for wearing a wire tape, and from this he deduced that Hemingway was an FBI agent. Hemingway warns him to leave the city before midnight or else Croselli would have his men kill him. They then part ways.

Reacher then meets a brunette, Chrissie at a coffee shop and they agree to go [[CBGB]] together using Chrissie's car. Inside the club they find Hemingway along with one of Croselli's henchmen, who promptly calls his boss on seeing Reacher. Meanwhile, Reacher gets to know that Jill Hemingway had been suspended from the FBI, pending review as part of the deal cut by Croselli with the FBI and that she was planning to bring him down. Reacher takes care of the henchman, just before a power outage strikes, before making his escape with Chrissie.

Chrissie and Reacher then make out in her car, when they encounter the [[Son of Sam]], a serial killer who killed couples making out in cars. Son of Sam couldn't see Chrissie and leaves, but not before Reacher gets a good look at his posture and mannerisms.

Reacher and Chrissie then meet Hemingway outside Croselli's hideout. Hemingway informs Reacher that due to the outage, Croselli's men were out protecting various businesses that paid him money, from looters and plunderers, leaving Croselli alone in his warren. Chrissie and Reacher part ways and then Reacher breaks into the hideout to take care of Croselli but not before he gets him to profess his various crimes on tape. Reacher leaves Croselli tied to a chair with the tape at his feet and Hemingway calls in the FBI.

Hemingway also makes a call to the New York Police Department about the Son of Sam based on the description given to her by Reacher. They then go to a motel where Jill dies of a [[myocardial infarction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Child |first= Lee |title= High Heat |publisher= Delacorte Press |year= 2013 |pages= 125|isbn= 978-0-345-54664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reacher leaves the motel after informing the police of her death.

The region is the historic home of the Native American [[Klamath people|Klamath]], [[Modoc people|Modoc]], and [[Yahooskin]] peoples.]]

The '''Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement''' (KBRA) is an American multi-party legal agreement determining river usage and water rights involving the [[Klamath River]] and [[Klamath Basin]] in the states of [[California]] and [[Oregon]]. Discussion of the KBRA began in 2005 and was ultimately signed into law in February 2010.

Parties to the agreement included the state of California, the state of Oregon, the [[Karuk Tribe]], the [[Klamath Tribes]], the [[Yurok Indian Reservation|Yurok Tribe]], [[Del Norte County, California]], [[Humboldt County, California]], [[Klamath County, Oregon]], [[Siskiyou County, California]]; 26 private individuals, companies, and local irrigation districts; and seven NGOs including [[California Trout]] and [[Trout Unlimited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement|url=http://klamathrestoration.gov/sites/klamathrestoration.gov/files/Klamath-Agreements/Klamath-Basin-Restoration-Agreement-2-18-10signed.pdf|website=Klamath Restoration|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background===
The idea behind the document originally stemmed from the 2001 irrigation water shutoff to [[Klamath Project]] farmers, when water was withheld from the irrigators in favor of the threatened coho salmon and the endangered Lost River Sucker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opb.org/programs/oregonstory/water/conflicts/page_2.html "Water Conflicts and Crises,"] The Oregon Story, Oregon Public Broadcasting.&lt;/ref&gt;  Downstream populations of coho salmon are within the Southern Oregon/Northern California [[Evolutionary Significant Unit]] and are listed as threatened (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/publications/status_reviews/salmon_steelhead/coho/2011_status_review_southern_oregon_northern_california_coast_coho.pdf |title=Southern Oregon/Northern California Coast Recovery Domain 5-Year Review: Summary and Evaluation of Southern Oregon/Northern California Coast Coho Salmon ESU |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations |year=2011 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, a symbolic Bucket Brigade was held, where nearly 20,000 people passed 50 buckets of water, one for each state, from [[Upper Klamath Lake]] to the A canal that supplies water to the [[Klamath Project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2001/07/01/klamath-falls-bucket-brigade-protests-water-shutoff "Klamath Falls bucket brigade protests water shutoff."] ''Heartland,'' July 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Talks commenced in 2005; a draft was proposed by 2009.

The Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) is a document that aims to: 
* help restore [[Riparian zone|Riparian Zones]] along much of the rivers in the [[Klamath Basin]]
* remove 4 Hydroelectric dams on the [[Klamath River]] with the goal of salmon restoration
* provides irrigation water assurances for Klamath Basin farmers
* provides the [[Klamath Tribes]] with the 90,000 acre Mazama Tree Farm

The final document was signed on February 18, 2010 in [[Salem, Oregon]]. Among the more notable signatories to the agreement was the Governor of California, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], the Governor of Oregon, [[Ted Kulongoski]],  and the Chairman of the [[Klamath Tribes]], Joseph Kirk.

Unfortunately, Congress failed to pass legislation that would implement the KBRA by the January 1, 2016 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northcoastjournal.com/humboldt/uncharted-waters/Content?oid=3511050|title=Uncharted Waters|website=The North Coast Journal Weekly|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new agreement, the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (KHSA) was signed on April 6, 2016 which plans to remove four hydroelectric dams (the Copco 1, Copco 2, J.C. Boyle, and Iron Gate) by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.times-standard.com/article/NJ/20160407/NEWS/160409896|title=Klamath dam deal only the start, officials say|website=www.times-standard.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Klētorologion'' of Philotheos''' ({{lang-el|Κλητορολόγιον}}), is the longest and most important of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] lists of offices and court precedence (''[[Taktika (disambiguation)|Taktika]]'').&lt;ref name="ODB1661"&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=1661}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in September 899 during the reign of Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]] (r. 886–912) by the otherwise unknown ''[[protospatharios|prōtospatharios]]'' and ''[[atriklines|atriklinēs]]'' Philotheos. As ''atriklinēs'', Philotheos would have been responsible for receiving the guests for the imperial banquets (''klētοria'') and for conducting them to their proper seating places according to their place in the [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|imperial hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|1911|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to his work, he explicitly states that he compiled this treatise as a "precise exposé of the order of imperial banquets, of the name and value of each title, complied on the basis of ancient ''klētοrologia''", and recommends its adoption at the imperial table.&lt;ref name="ODB1661"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bury15"&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|1911|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections==
Philotheos's work survives only as an [[Addendum|appendix]] within the last chapters (52–54) of the second book of a later treatise on imperial ceremonies known as the ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' of Emperor [[Constantine Porphyrogennetos]] (r. 913–959).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|1911|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into four sections:

*Section I is the introductory, and gives a brief overview of all the court ranks and state offices of the [[Byzantine Empire]], which it divides into five categories: orders of rank for "bearded men" (i.e. non-eunuchs), great offices of the state, minor offices of the various bureaus and ministries, orders of rank for eunuchs, and great offices of the state reserved for eunuchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|1911|pp=14–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sections II and III give the order in which officials should be introduced to the imperial banquets. Section II gives the highest dignitaries, those who could be seated at the Byzantine emperor's own table, while Section III deals with middle-ranking and lower-ranking officials, as well as with the embassies from the other [[patriarchate]]s ([[Patriarch of Rome|Rome]], [[Greek Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]] and [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]) and foreign embassies ([[Caliphate|Arabs]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] and [[East Francia|Germans]]).&lt;ref name="Bury15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODB1662"&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=1662}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Section IV is the longest portion of the text, and is addressed to the court ''atriklinēs'' giving advice on arranging the various banquets throughout the year, beginning with the celebrations for [[Christmas]]. It also contains two attached memoranda, one on the largesses doled out by the Byzantine emperor to officials on certain occasions, and the other on the salaries of the ''atriklinai'' officials.&lt;ref name="Bury15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODB1662" /&gt;
*A short appendix follows (chapter 54 of the ''De Ceremoniis'') with the various ecclesiastic officials and their precedence, as well as the ''[[Notitia Episcopatuum]]'' of pseudo-Epiphanius, a list of [[Diocese|episcopal sees]].&lt;ref name="Bury15"/&gt;

'''''La Ventana''''' is the [[yearbook]] of [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]. The student media organization began its publication in 1925.&lt;ref name="Toreador"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/la_ventana/|title=La Ventana Yearbook|last=Toreador|first=The Daily|website=The Daily Toreador|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the oldest traditions at Texas Tech University, ''La Ventana'' (Spanish for "the window") serves as the school's primary source of recorded history. Its mission is to produce an outstanding depiction of the life of Texas Tech students in an accurate, appealing and innovative manner with broad coverage, in-depth stories, dynamic photographs, tight organization and creative design.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/studentmedia/laventana.php|title=Texas Tech University :: Student Media :: La Ventana|website=www.depts.ttu.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''La Ventana'' operates under the direction of an editorial board made up entirely of Texas Tech students. This group oversees the student staff. Student Media advisers oversee the activities of the yearbook; however, content is determined entirely by the student staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''La Ventana'' is printed each spring semester and distributed at the end of the spring semester.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
===Beginning===
The first volume of ''La Ventana'' was edited by James Biggers. It began in 1925 and was published in 1926 for Texas Technological College, as [[Texas Tech University]] was known at the time. The name was chosen in keeping with the university's [[Spanish Renaissance|Spanish-themed architecture]], which was also reflected in the name of the student newspaper ''[[The Daily Toreador|The Toreador]]'' and in the name of the football team (at the time) [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|The Matadors]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/archives/article_503f0bc1-624d-5572-9b32-1052756606e1.html | title=''La Ventana'' keeps same theme since 1925|accessdate=October 16, 2013 | date=February 24, 2003 | publisher=[[The Daily Toreador]] | first1=Nikki | last1=Siegrist | first2=Jason | last2=Lenz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''la ventana'' mean "the window". As the premier volume states:

{{quote|The editors express the hope it will serve not only as a window through which the world will gaze on the achievements of your first year, but as the window through which it can behold the dawning glory and splendor of the Greater Institution that is to be.|La Ventana Vol. 1&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;}}

===Growth===
The first color photos appeared in the book in 1933. Progress continued until the beginning of [[World War II]]. During the war years, it focused on victory themes, shrank in size, and re-used some older photos to fill space. Following the war, growth resumed and, by the 1950s, ''La Ventana'' was up to an average of 500 pages.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; In 1959, ''La Ventana'' went to a magazine format, with the book divided into sections mimicking national magazines such as ''[[Post Magazine|Post]]'', ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. The different sections represented different aspects of life at Texas Tech. ''Sports Illustrated'' focused on campus sports. ''Life'' looked at college life in general and ''Post'' covered honor councils and [[Students' union|student government]].&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

{{Contains Vietnamese text}}
{{for|the East Asian language superphylum proposed by Stanley Starosta|Sino-Austronesian languages}}
The languages of [[East Asia]] belong to several distinct [[language families]], with many common features attributed to interaction. In the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], Chinese varieties and languages of southeast Asia share many [[areal feature]]s, tending to be [[analytic language]]s with similar syllable and tone structure. In the 1st millennium AD, Chinese culture came to [[East Asian cultural sphere|dominate East Asia]]. [[Literary Chinese]] was adopted by scholars in [[Literary Chinese in Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Chinese-language literature of Korea|Korea]], and [[Kanbun|Japan]]. There was a massive influx of Chinese vocabulary into these and other neighboring languages. The [[Chinese script]] was also adapted to write [[Vietnamese writing system|Vietnamese]], [[Korean writing system|Korean]], and [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], though in the first two the use of Chinese characters is now restricted to university learning, linguistic or historical study, artistic or decorative works and (in Korean's case) newspapers.

== Language families ==
{{see also|Classification schemes for Southeast Asian languages}}

The [[Austroasiatic languages]] include [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Khmer language|Khmer]], as well as many other languages spoken in areas scattered as far afield as Malaya and eastern India, often in isolated pockets surrounded by the ranges of other language groups. Most linguists believe that Austroasiatic languages once ranged continuously across southeast Asia and that their scattered distribution today is the result of the subsequent arrival of other language groups.{{sfnp|Sidwell|Blench|2011|pp=339–340}}

One of these groups were the [[Tai–Kadai languages]] such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Lao language|Lao]] and [[Shan language|Shan]]. These languages were originally spoken in southern China, where the greatest diversity within the family is still found, and possibly as far north as the Yangtze valley. As Chinese civilization expanded [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|southward]] from the North China Plain, many Tai–Kadai speakers became sinicized, while others were displaced to Southeast Asia. With the exception of [[Zhuang language|Zhuang]], most of the Tai–Kadai languages still remaining in China are spoken in isolated upland areas.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=233}}

The [[Miao–Yao]] or Hmong–Mien languages also originated in southern China, where they are now spoken only in isolated hill regions. Many Hmong–Mien speakers were displaced into Southeast Asia during the Qing Dynasty in the 18th and 19th centuries, triggered by the suppression of a series of [[Miao Rebellion (1854–73)|revolts]] in [[Guizhou]].{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=278–279}}

The [[Austronesian languages]] are believed to have spread from [[Taiwan]] to the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, as well as some areas of mainland southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Diamond|2000}}

The [[varieties of Chinese]] are usually included in the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]], which also includes [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] spoken in Tibet, southwest China, northeast India, Burma and neighbouring countries.

To the north are the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] language families, which some linguists had grouped as an [[Altaic languages|Altaic family]], sometimes also including the [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] languages, but is now seen as a discredited theory and is no longer supported by specialists in these languages.&lt;ref&gt;"While 'Altaic' is repeated in encyclopedias and handbooks most specialists in these languages no longer believe that the three traditional supposed Altaic groups, Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic, are related." Lyle Campbell &amp; Mauricio J. Mixco, A Glossary of Historical Linguistics (2007, University of Utah Press), pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The languages tend to be atonal, polysyllabic and [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]], with [[subject–object–verb]] word order and some degree of [[vowel harmony]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=6}} Critics of the Altaic hypothesis attribute the similarities to intense language contact between the languages that occurred sometime in pre-history.{{sfnp|Schönig|2003|p=403}}

Chinese scholars often group Tai–Kadai and Hmong–Mien with Sino-Tibetan, but Western scholarship since the Second World War has considered them as separate families. Some larger groupings have been proposed, but are not widely supported. The [[Austric languages|Austric]] hypothesis, based on [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and other resemblances, is that Austroasiatic, Austronesian, often Tai–Kadai, and sometimes Hmong–Mien form a genetic family. Other hypothetical groupings include the [[Sino-Austronesian languages]] and [[Austro-Tai languages]]. Linguists undergoing long-range comparison have hypothesized even larger [[macrofamily|macrofamilies]] such as [[Dené–Caucasian]], including Sino-Tibetan and [[Ket language|Ket]].

== Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area ==
{{main|Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area}}
The Mainland Southeast Asia [[linguistic area]] stretches from Thailand to China and is home to speakers of languages of the Sino-Tibetan, Hmong–Mien (or Miao–Yao), Tai-Kadai, Austronesian (represented by [[Chamic]]) and Austro–Asiatic families. Neighbouring languages across these families, though presumed unrelated, often have similar typological features, which are believed to have spread by diffusion.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|pp=182–184}}

Characteristic of many MSEA languages is a particular syllable structure involving [[monosyllabic]] [[morpheme]]s, [[lexical tone]], a fairly large inventory of consonants, including phonemic [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], limited clusters at the beginning of a syllable, plentiful vowel contrasts and relatively few final consonants. Languages in the northern part of the area generally have fewer vowel and final contrasts but more initial contrasts.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|pp=186–187}}

A well-known feature is the similar tone systems in Chinese, Hmong–Mien, Tai languages and Vietnamese. Most of these languages passed through an earlier stage with three tones on most syllables (apart from [[checked syllable]]s ending in a [[stop consonant]]), which was followed by a [[tone split]] where the distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants disappeared but in compensation the number of tones doubled.
These parallels led to confusion over the classification of these languages, until [[André-Georges Haudricourt|Haudricourt]] showed in 1954 that tone was not an invariant feature, by demonstrating that Vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other languages of the Mon–Khmer family, and proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=53–56}}

MSEA languages tend to have monosyllabic morphemes, though there are exceptions.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|p=186}} Most MSEA languages are very [[analytic language|analytic]], with no [[inflection]] and little derivational morphology. Grammatical relations are typically signalled by word order, [[grammatical particle|particle]]s and [[coverb]]s or [[adposition]]s. [[linguistic modality|Modality]] is expressed using [[sentence-final particle]]s. The usual word order in MSEA languages is [[subject–verb–object]]. Chinese and [[Karen language|Karen]] are thought to have changed to this order from the [[subject–object–verb]] order retained by most other Sino-Tibetan languages.
The order of constituents within a noun phrase varies: noun–modifier order is usual in Tai languages, Vietnamese and Miao, while in Chinese varieties and Yao most modifiers are placed before the noun.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|pp=187–190}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=280}} [[Topic-comment]] organization is also common.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|pp=189–190}}

Languages of both eastern and southeast Asia typically have well-developed systems of [[numeral classifier]]s.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|p=189}} The neighbouring [[Bengali language]] has numerical classifiers, even though it is an Indo-European language which do not share the other features discussed in this article. Bengali also lacks [[grammatical gender|gender]], unlike most [[Indo-European languages]]. Bengali (especially the eastern variety) is more phonologically similar to southeastern and eastern languages than those further away from the region, with alveolar consonants replacing the retroflex consonants characteristic of other Indo-Aryan languages. Some dialects bordering southeast Asia such as [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]] have even developed phonemic tone. The other areas of the world where numerical classifier systems are common in indigenous languages are the western parts of North and South America, so that numerical classifiers could even be seen as a pan-[[Pacific Rim]] areal feature.{{sfnp|Nichols|1992|pp=131–133}} However, similar noun class systems are also found among most [[African languages|Sub-Saharan African languages]].

== Influence of Literary Chinese ==
{{main|Adoption of Chinese literary culture|Sino-Xenic vocabularies}}
For most of the pre-modern period, Chinese culture dominated East Asia. Scholars in Vietnam, Korea and Japan wrote in [[Literary Chinese]] and were thoroughly familiar with the [[Chinese classics]]. Their languages absorbed large numbers of Chinese words, known collectively as Sino-Xenic vocabulary, i.e. [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]], [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] and [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]]. These words were written with [[Chinese characters]] and pronounced in a local approximation of [[Middle Chinese]].{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|p=99}}

Today, these words of Chinese origin may be written in the [[traditional Chinese]] characters (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), [[simplified Chinese]] characters (Chinese, Japanese), a locally developed phonetic script (Korean [[hangul]], Japanese [[kana]]), or a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] ([[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]]). The Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages are collectively referred to as CJKV, or just [[CJK]], since modern Vietnamese is no longer written with Chinese characters at all.

In a similar way to the use of [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]] roots in English, the morphemes of Classical Chinese have been used extensively in all these languages to coin compound words for new concepts.{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|p=146}} These coinages, written in shared Chinese characters, have then been borrowed freely between languages. They have even been accepted into Chinese, a language usually resistant to loanwords, because their foreign origin was hidden by their written form.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2000|p=43}}

=== Topic–comment constructions ===
In [[Topic-prominent language|topic–comment constructions]], sentences are frequently structured with a [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]] as the first segment and a comment as the second. This way of marking previously mentioned vs. newly introduced information is an alternative to [[article (grammar)|articles]], which are not found in East Asian languages. The Topic–comment sentence structure is a legacy of Classical Chinese influence on the grammar of modern East Asian languages. In Classical Chinese, the focus of the phrase (i.e. the topic) was often placed first, which was then followed by a statement about the topic. The most generic sentence form in Classical Chinese is "A B 也", where ''B'' is a comment about the topic ''A''.

===Politeness systems===
Linguistic systems of [[politeness]], including frequent use of [[honorific]]s, with varying levels of politeness or respect, are well-developed in Japanese and Korean. Politeness systems in Chinese are relatively weak, having simplified from a [[Chinese honorifics|more developed system]] into a much less predominant role in modern Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inst.at/kctos/speakers_g-m/kadar.htm
KCTOS 2007: What Happened to the Honorifics?&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true when speaking of the southern Chinese varieties. However, Vietnamese has retained a highly complex system of pronouns, in which the terms mostly derive from Chinese. For example, ''bác'', ''chú'', ''dượng'', and ''cậu'' are all terms ultimately derived from Chinese and all refer to different statuses of "uncle".

In many of the region's languages, including Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Malay/Indonesian, new [[personal pronoun]]s or forms of reference or address can and often do evolve from nouns as fresh ways of expressing respect or social status. Thus personal pronouns are [[open class word]]s rather than [[closed class word]]s: they are not stable over time, not few in number, and not [[clitic]]s whose use is obligatory in grammatical constructs.

With modernization and other trends, politeness language is evolving to be simpler. Avoiding the need for complex polite language can also motivate use in some situations of languages like Indonesian or English that have less complex respect systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2016">[[File:Long Valley caldera NE rim.jpg|thumb|right|General area where Gid Whiteman searched for the Lost Cement Mine.]]
The '''Lost Cement Mine''' is a legendary gold vein situated in the eastern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] of [[California]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite book|title=Lost Cement Mine|first=James|last=Wright|isbn=0-931378-09-5|year=1984|publisher=Live Oak Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was supposedly found in 1857 by two men who were separated from their group while crossing the Sierra.  They traveled near the headwaters of the [[Owens River]], and found some hardened red [[igneous rock]] that may have had a large amount of gold in it. One of the men kept the ore, but was dying of [[tuberculosis]] in 1860, so gave the ore to a Doctor Randall in payment, along with a rough location of it. In miner's parlance of the era, the red igneous rock was known as "cement", hence the name of the lost mine.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

Doctor Randall and his assistant Gid Whiteman spent years looking for the ore in the [[pumice]] hills to the south and west of [[Deadman Summit]]. News of the search leaked out to the mining communities near [[Mono Lake]]. This news caused a frenzy of furtive searching. Mark Twain was near Mono Lake and joined in the search, which was documented in his book  ''[[Roughing It]]''.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roughing It|first=Mark|last=Twain|year=1872|chapter=XXXVII|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Roughing_It/Chapter_XXXVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Wright wrote a series of newspaper articles about the search in 1879. He speculated that the lost cement was actually found across the [[Sierra Crest]], near [[Devils Postpile]]. Wright claimed that the lost cement was mined for a number of years in secret, and then the mining cabin was destroyed to prevent others from finding the ore.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

'''''Merit Students Encyclopedia''''' was a printed [[encyclopedia]] that was very similar to ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'', but was geared towards upper grade school through college level. It was printed by Crowell-Collier Educational Corporation from about 1967-1992 (1967 was cited from the 1969 edition). There were twenty volumes, with two volumes of a dictionary in the set.

The encyclopedia volumes are also arranged like a dictionary, with each volume being of a uniform size separated by words, instead of by the letter of the alphabet. There were also "Student Guides" which give a brief overview of certain topics. Also, "Highlights In History" (a printed [[timeline]]) and other graphs another "headings" make it easy to find information. There is a listing of "Books for Further Study" on certain articles. The topics are written by various authors, who are cited at the end.

[[NATO]], through its interoperability directive, has recognized that widespread interoperability is a key component in achieving effective and efficient operations. In many of the operations world-wide in which [[NATO]] nations are engaged, they participate together with a wide variety of other organizations on the ground. Such organizations include coalition partners from non-NATO nations, [[Non-Governmental Organization]] (NGOs - e.g. Aid Agencies) and industrial partners. The [[NATO]] Interoperability Standards and Profiles (NISP) provides the necessary guidance and technical components to support project implementations and [[Federated Mission Networking]].

The Allied Data Publication 34 (ADaTP-34) [https://nhqc3s.hq.nato.int/Apps/Architecture/NISP/ '''NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles (NISP)'''] STANAG 5524, catalogs Consultation, Command and Control (C3) standards usable in NATO. Work on the NISP is performed under the [[NATO Consultation, Command and Control Board]].

'''Phillips v Phillips''' [1993] 3 NZLR 159; (1993) 10 FRNZ 110 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]], where both parties entering into a contract make the same mistake (often referred to as a common mistake) when a contract is formed, under section 6(1)(a)(ii) of the [[Contractual Mistakes Act 1977]].
&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Mrs Phillips was in a de facto relation with Mr Phillips for 12 years. They had 4 children together, and she had worked at several of her husbands businesses. At the breakdown of the relationship, they entered into a separation agreement, which gave Mrs Phillips far less than she was legally entitled to.

However, it was later discovered that such a separation agreement was not legally enforceable, and Mrs Phillips applied to the court to have the separation order set aside under section 6(1)(a)(ii) on the grounds that it was a common mistake, as both parties mistakenly thought that the separation agreement was legally enforceable.

==Held==
The court ruled that there was a common mistake here, and set aside the previous separation order.

The central and eastern [[Alps]] of Europe are rich in [[folklore]] traditions dating back to pre-Christian times, with surviving elements amalgamated from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]], [[Celtic paganism|Gaulish]] ([[Gallo-Roman]]), [[Slavic paganism|Slavic]], ([[Carantanians|Carantanian]]) and [[Raetians|Raetian]] culture.

== Survival through the ages ==
{{further information|Crypto-Paganism|Syncretism}}
Ancient customs survived in the [[rural]] parts of [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Bavaria]], [[Slovenia]], western and northern [[Croatia]] and north eastern [[Italy]] in the form of [[dance]], [[art]], processions, [[rituals]] and [[game]]s. The high regional diversity results from the mutual isolation of Alpine communities. In the Alps, the relationship between the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and paganism has been an ambivalent one. While some customs survived only in the remote [[valley]]s inaccessible to the church's influence, other customs were actively assimilated over the centuries. In light of the dwindling rural population of the Alps, many customs have evolved into more modern interpretations.

==Pastoral traditions==
Around September 8, the feast of the Nativity of Mary, it is customary to bring the cattle down from the [[upland pasture]]s for the winter. In Bavaria, women weave fir wreaths decorated with paper roses and small mirrors to ward off demons during the downhill journey. It has been suggested that this derives from end-of-summer festivals in honor of the Germanic goddess [[Iðunn]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IKqOUfqt4cIC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=Pre-Christian+Alpine+traditions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6t19bstbDH&amp;sig=G-4TY2DRRQcVBsJzk33Ml4ROZDA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK2cLCt4zOAhUGkh4KHR6ABLM4KBDoAQhGMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=Pre-Christian%20Alpine%20traditions&amp;f=false Roy, Christian. "Alpine Pastoral Customs", ''Traditional Festivals'', Vol. 1, ABC-CLIO, 2005] {{ISBN|9781576070895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winter traditions==

===Krampus===
{{Main article|Krampus}}
[[File:Krampus at Perchtenlauf Klagenfurt.jpg|right|thumb|Krampus]]
The word ''Krampus'' originates from the [[Old High German]] word for [[claw]] (''Krampen''). In the Alpine regions, the Krampus is a mythical horned figure represented as [[Companions of Saint Nicholas|accompanying Saint Nicholas]]. Krampus acts as an anti–Saint Nicholas, who, instead of giving gifts to good children, gives warnings and punishments to the bad children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/krampus-could-come-you-holiday-season-180957438/?no-ist Billock, Jennifer. "The Origin of Krampus, Europe's Evil Twist on Santa", Smithsonian.com, December 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, young men dress up as the Krampus in the first two weeks of December, particularly in the evening of December 5, and roam the streets frightening children and women with rusty chains and whips and bells. This figure is believed to originate from stories of house spirits such as [[kobolds]] or [[elves]].

===Perchten===
{{Main article|Perchta}}
Originally, the word ''Perchten'' (plural of ''Perchta'') referred to the female masks representing the entourage of an ancient [[goddess]], ''Frau Perchta'', or ''Pehta Baba'' as it is known in Slovenia. Some claim a connection to the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] goddess [[Freyja]], though this is uncertain. Traditionally, the masks were displayed in processions (''Perchtenlauf'') during the last week of December and first week of January, and particularly on January 6. The costume consists of a brown wooden mask and brown or white sheep's skin. In recent times Krampus and Perchten have increasingly been displayed in a single event, leading to a loss of distinction of the two. Perchten are associated with [[midwinter]] and the embodiment of [[Destiny|fate]] and the [[soul]]s of the dead. The name originates from the Old High German word ''peraht'' ("brilliant" or "bright").

Sometimes, ''[[The Devil|der Teufel]]'' is viewed to be the most ''schiach'' ("ugly") '''Percht''' (masculine singular of ''Perchten'') and ''[[Perchta|Frau Perchta]]'' to be the most ''schön'' ("beautiful") '''Perchtin''' (female singular of ''Perchten'').

==Spring traditions==
[[Chalandamarz]] is an ancient festival celebrated by the Romansh speaking part of the Swiss Canton Graubünden. It is celebrated on the first of March and marks the end of winter and the arrival of spring.

{{Main article|Badalisc}}
The [[Badalisc]] is a "good" mythological animal who lives in the woods of Andrista, in [[Val Camonica]], [[Italy]]. During an annual town festival someone dresses up as the creature and is "captured" and brought to the town. The animal is made to tell the people of the town gossip. At the end of the festival the creature is released until the next year's ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demologia.it/brescia/feste/3cevo/basalisk.htm ADL ©Atlante Demologico Lombardo: Il Bresciano - Festa del Badalisc ad Andrista di Cevo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of the [[Cold War]] the international community through international institutions has been focusing on preventive diplomacy. As the [[United Nations]] and regional organizations as well as global and regional powers discovered the high costs of managing conflict, there is a strong common perception of benevolence of preventive diplomacy. Preventive diplomacy actions can be implemented by the [[UN]], regional organizations, [[NGO]] networks and individual states. One of the examples of preventive diplomacy is the [[UN]] [[peacekeeping]] mission in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] ([[UNPREDEP]]) in 1995–1999. It was the first UN preventive action. 

Preventive measures include: [[conflict early warning]], [[fact-finding]], [[confidence-building measures]], [[early deployment]], [[humanitarian assistance]], and [[demilitarized zone]]s.&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2600">Dr. '''Richard Francis Weymouth''' (M.A., D.Litt.) (1822–1902) was an English schoolmaster, [[Baptists|Baptist]] layman and [[Biblical studies|Bible student]] known particularly for producing one of the earliest modern language translations of the [[New Testament]].

==Life==
Born near [[Devonport, Devon]], he was the son of [[Richard Weymouth]] and his wife Ann Sprague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=36846|first=John D.|last=Haigh|title=Weymouth, Richard Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[University College London]]. He taught at a [[private school]] in [[Surrey]] before being appointed [[headmaster]] of [[Mill Hill School]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22138 Schools - Mill Hill School | British History Online&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.british-history.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; in 1869, when Thomas Scrutton and his supporters formed a new trust to reopen and revive the school, which had closed the previous year. Weymouth was also a fellow of [[University College London]] from 1869, and taught there until 1886, before retiring in 1891 to devote himself to [[textual criticism]] and Bible study. He died in 1902.

==Works==
Weymouth's first important work was ''The Resultant Greek Testament'', an eclectic text based on the work of the most prominent textual critics of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. His major publication was ''The Modern Speech New Testament'', known as the [[Weymouth New Testament]], edited by his secretary, Ernest Hampden-Cook, and published in 1903 in New York and [[London England]]. Weymouth wanted to produce a version that ordinary people could read. It renders Greek idioms into modern English.

'''Saadiyat Island''' ({{lang-ar| جزيرة السعديات}}; ''{{Transl|ar|jazīrat as-saʿdiyyāt}}'', for "Island of Happiness"&lt;ref name="Group2014" /&gt;) is a [[Cultural tourism|tourism-cultural]] project for nature and [[Culture of the United Arab Emirates|Emirati heritage and culture]].&lt;ref name="Exell2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQu4CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|title=Modernity and the Museum in the Arabian Peninsula|date=10 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-27901-3|page=63|author=Karen Exell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, under development, consists of a large, [[Low-lying coast|low-lying]] island, {{convert|500|m}} off the coast of [[Abu Dhabi]] island, [[UAE]]. A mixed commercial, residential, and leisure project is currently under construction on the island, expected to be completed in 2020. Saadiyat Island is expected to become Abu Dhabi's cultural centre, mostly for the Island’s Cultural District that is expected to include eight museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uae-embassy.org/news-media/saadiyat-island-home-guggenheim-and-louvre-museums|title=Saadiyat Island Home to Guggenheim and Louvre Museums|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island is five-minute drive away from downtown Abu Dhabi, 20 minutes from [[Abu Dhabi International Airport]], and one hour from Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.saadiyat.ae/en/about-saadiyat |title= About Saadiyat Island Abu Dhabi - Project by TDIC
|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The project is being developed by the [[Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority]]-held [[Tourism Development &amp; Investment Company]] (TDIC). The company plans is to dispose of development to private investors that will work on their sites in accordance with the master plan as well as other ground rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/abu-dhabi/press-room/press-releases/1853-abu-dhabi-to-build-gehry-designed-Guggenheim|title=Abu Dhabi to Build Gehry-Designed Guggenheim Museum|publisher=The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|date=July 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saadiyat.ae/en/about-saadiyat|title= Saadiyat in Numbers|website=www.saadiyat.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan for Saadiyat island was done by [[EDAW]] and continued under [[AECOM]].

The Island is located 500 meters off the coast of Abu Dhabi. An entire district on the island is devoted to culture and the arts, with exhibitions, permanent collections, productions and performances.&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdic.ae/TDIC/aboutus/Pages/index.aspx|title=Overview - About Us - TDIC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Close cooperation ===
In developing the island project, the [[Cooperation|close cooperation]] model is being followed by TDIC and the government agencies. The government-related entity has been working in cooperation with government agencies such as the Department of Transport to create an integrated project, complete with public amenities, in a relatively short period of time. Such close cooperation reassures smaller, private developers, who follow the GRE by providing smaller-scale works like shops, entertainment venues or real estate developments, which in turn attract a [[Residency (domicile)|full-time resident]] community.&lt;ref name="Group2014" /&gt;

== Features and services ==
The island has several cultural institutions in [[Saadiyat Island#Saadiyat Cultural District|Saadiyat Cultural District]].

== The Accommodation Village ==
The Saadiyat Accommodation Village, opened in 2009, is a modern housing community that offers social, recreational and educational facilities for residents.&lt;ref name="ftn5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saadiyat.ae/en/worker-welfare|title=Welfare|website=saadiyat.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development and labor conditions ===
The [[European Union]] has sent several delegations to Saadiyat Accommodation Village to meet with representatives from the TDIC.&lt;ref name="ftn6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/eu-delegates-positive-about-saadiyat-workers-living-space|title=EU delegates ‘positive’ about Saadiyat workers’ living space|website=thenational.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Gulf Ultra Luxury Faction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/arts/design/inside-frank-gehrys-guggenheim-abu-dhabi.html|title=A New Art Capital, Finding Its Own Voice|date=7 December 2014|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued a report accusing the contractors working on Saadiyat Island of violating the rights of workers on the site by charging them fees to obtain their work contracts, paying them less than they were promised, and holding their passports to prevent their resignation or departure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/05/18/uae-exploited-workers-building-island-happiness UAE: Exploited Workers Building ‘Island of Happiness’].&lt;/ref&gt; The report also called on western partners (including Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, the [[French Museum Agency]], and [[New York University]]) to seek contractual assurances that these violations would not continue once construction on facilities for those institutions was underway. The alleged violations of the workers' rights would also constitute violations of [[United Arab Emirates]] law. The activist group [[Gulf Labor]], which has staged protests at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] and the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]], continues to pressure Western art museums to use ethical labor practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/19/the-gulf-art-war|title=The Gulf Art War|last=Azimi|first=Negar|date=December 19, 2016|website=The New Yorker|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed districts==
[[File:Al Jubail Saadiyat Island aerial view.jpg|thumb|The eastern side of Saadiyat Island, seen from the air]]
Saadiyat Island, a natural island that is the focus of 27&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of development, will be divided into 7 districts ({{Lang-ar|منطقة}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdic.ae/ar/project/saadiyat/Pages/lagoons_district.aspx|title=منطقة لجونز السعديات|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will eventually accommodate over 145,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saadiyat.ae/en/about-saadiyat|title=About Saadiyat Island Abu Dhabi - Project by TDIC|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saadiyat.ae/Admin/Content/TDIC-EPP-Compliance-Monitoring-2012-File223201565218.pdf|title=Tourism Development &amp; Investment Company.

=== Saadiyat Cultural District ===
Located at the Western end of the island, Saadiyat Cultural District occupies not much more than 10 per cent of the total area of the project.&lt;ref name="WippelBromber2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfmXCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA179|title=Under Construction: Logics of Urbanism in the Gulf Region|date=17 February 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00529-2|pages=179–|author1=Steffen Wippel|author2=Katrin Bromber|author3=Birgit Krawietz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cultural District lies on a total area of {{convert|2.43|km2|mi2}}. There are plans to spend 85 million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] on the following projects:
* [[Louvre Abu Dhabi|Louvre]] museum, which was planned to open in 2015,&lt;ref name="open1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saadiyat.ae/en/masterplan/saadiyat-cultural-district/louvre-abu-dhabi2.html|title=Saadiyat -Louvre Abu Dhabi  |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Sheikh [[Zayed National Museum]] by [[Foster + Partners]]
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Abu Dhabi Performing arts center|tr|3=Abu Dabi Gösteri Sanatları Merkezi}} by [[Zaha Hadid]]

==== Museums ====
{{See also|Abu Dhabi Art}}
The Cultural District will house three major museums: The local Louvre and Guggenheim, as well as the Zayed National Museum. The contract for the Louvre Abu Dhabi was awarded in January 2013 to Arabtec Construction, Oger Abu Dhabi and Constructor San José, and it was scheduled for completion in 2015. The Zayed National Museum, designed by architect Norman Foster of [[Foster and Partners]], was set to open in 2016. The Guggenheim, by [[Frank Gehry]], is slated to open in 2017.&lt;ref name="Group2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RDPBwAAQBAJ|title=The Report: Abu Dhabi 2014|last=|first=|date=25 March 2014|publisher=Oxford Business Group|year=|isbn=978-1-907065-97-2|location=|pages=|via=|author=Oxford Business Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these institutions will represent a significant attraction in its own right. However, the Louvre and the Guggenheim will be the major draws.&lt;ref name="SandıkcıRice2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SkCtS-n7GEEC&amp;pg=PA450|title=Handbook of Islamic Marketing|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-0-85793-602-8|pages=450–|author1=Özlem Sandıkcı|author2=Gillian Rice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manarat Al Saadiyat ({{Lang-ar|منارة السعديات}}), the building designed to host temporary taster exhibitions for the planned museums, hosts the Saadiyat Experience, a permanent exhibition that introduces the plans for the development Of Saadiyat Island.&lt;ref name="Exell20163"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQu4CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|title=Modernity and the Museum in the Arabian Peninsula|date=10 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-27901-3|pages=63–|author=Karen Exell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local Louvre will mark the first time the French government has entered into an international partnership to extend the Louvre overseas. The 30-year agreement, signed in 2007, will see the loan of some 200–300 artworks over the period of the deal.&lt;ref name="SandıkcıRice2011" /&gt;

The architecture of the museum reflects Emirati construction and decoration. The ceiling of the museum will picture the sky and the sea merging into one another. Wind, as one of the natural factors that shape the history of the UAE in general, will also be pictured. The main part of the project will be an underground basin, a traditional sailboat and the boat "Zayed Memorial", which crossed the Atlantic in 2007 for humanitarian purposes.&lt;ref name="ftn4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/abu-dhabi/about/cultural-district|title=Saadiyat Cultural District|website=guggenheim.org/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118105118/http://www.guggenheim.org/abu-dhabi/about/cultural-district|archivedate=2011-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social History and Industrial Classification''' (SHIC) is a classification system used by many British museums for social history and industrial collections.
It was first published in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHIC Home|url=http://www.holm.demon.co.uk/shic/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
SHIC was classifies materials (books, objects, recordings etc.) by their interaction with the people who used them. For example, a carpenter's hammer is classified with other tools of the carpenter, and not with a blacksmith's hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHIC Section A|url=http://www.holm.demon.co.uk/shic/shicint.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast other classification systems, for example the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]], might class all hammers together and close to the classification for other percussive tools. The specialist subject network, Social History Curator's Group (SHCG), obtained funding in 2012 to develop an on-line version, now on their website http://www.shcg.org.uk/&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social History Curators' Group - SHCG|url=http://www.shcg.org.uk/About-SHIC|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheme==
Materials are classified under four major category numbers:
#Community life
#Domestic and family life
#Personal life
#Working life
 
Further classification within a category is by the use of further numbers after the decimal point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHIC Section B|url=http://www.holm.demon.co.uk/shic/shicint.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is permissible to assign more than one classification in cases where the object had more than one use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHIC Section F |url=http://www.holm.demon.co.uk/shic/shicint.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1183">The '''Sofia Second Chronicle''' is a [[Russia]]n [[chronicle]] from the 16th century.  It is found in two redactions: The Archival redaction, from the first quarter of the 16th century and now in the [[Russian State Archive of Ancient Documents]] (RGADA) (Fond 181, No. 371); and the Voskresenskii (''Resurrection'') Redaction from the middle of the 16th century, now housed in the [[State Historical Museum]] (GIM) on the north end of [[Red Square]] (Voskresenskoe Sobranie, bumazhnoe, No. 154).  It was first published at the beginning of the 19th century and is included in the [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles]] (PSRL, vol. 6; St. Petersburg, 1851).

The Sofia Second Chronicle is thought to have derived from the [[Lvov Chronicle]] with which it shares many similarities.&lt;ref&gt;See entry on Sofia Second Chronicle in Ia. S. Lur'e, ed., ''Slovar' Knizhnikov i knizhnosti drevnei Rusi,'' available online at http://lib.pushkinskijdom.ru/Default.aspx?tabid=4296&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], '''symbolic ethnicity''' is a nostalgic allegiance to, love for, and pride in a [[Cultural history|cultural]] [[tradition]] that can be felt and lived without having to be incorporated to the person's everyday behavior;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winter|first=J. Alan|title=Symbolic ethnicity or religion among Jews in the United States: a test of Gansian hypothesis|jstor=3512276|work=Review of Religious Research, Vol. 37, No.3|publisher=Connecticut College|date=March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; as such, a symbolic ethnic identity usually is composed of images from mass communications media.{{vague|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref name="Identity and belonging"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The term was introduced in the article "Symbolic Ethnicity: The Future of Ethnic Groups and Cultures in America" (1979), by [[Herbert J. Gans]], in the journal ''[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gans|first=Herbert J.|authorlink=Herbert J. Gans|title=Symbolic ethnicity: the future of ethnic groups and cultures in America|journal=[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]|volume=2|issue=1|date=January 1979|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/charles/562_f2011/Week%2010/Gans%201979.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tandfonline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Symbolic ethnicity and symbolic religiosity: Towards a comparison of ethnic and religious acculturation|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870.1994.9993841#preview|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The development of symbolic ethnicity, as a sociological phenomenon, is attributed to mainly to ethnic European immigrants of second and subsequent generations, because "[[Black American|Black]], [[Hispanic American|Hispanic]], [[Asian American|Asian]] and [[Indian Americans]] do not have the option of a symbolic ethnicity, at present, in the United States"; a socio-economic circumstance "in which ethnicity does not matter for white Americans, [yet] it does matter for non-whites".&lt;ref name="Identity and belonging"/&gt;
==Overview==
In the U.S., symbolic ethnicity is an important component of American cultural identity, assumed as "a voluntary, personally chosen identity marker, rather than the totally ascribed characteristic" determined by physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ammerman|first=Nancy T.|title=Everyday Religion: Observing Modern Religious Lives|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780195305401|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a sociological phenomenon, symbolic ethnicity is attributed to Americans of European ancestry, most of whom either are influenced by or assimilated to the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] (WASP) community.&lt;ref name="Identity and belonging"/&gt;

As such, symbolic ethnicity is the process of [[social identity]] whereby the person's "ethnic identity is solely associated with iconic elements of the culture" from which he or she originated. Gans's investigations concentrated on the latter generations of Roman Catholic and Jewish Americans who had "begun to re-associate themselves with their ethnic culture", noting that "the ethnic associations were mainly symbolic, and that the traditional community interactions were lost". Those Catholic and Jewish Americans identified "their ethnic race in a personal perspective, as opposed to a communal" perspective, which actions produced an "outward ethnic identity that uses superficial symbols and icons to label and categorize a certain race". That is to say, people identify their ethnicity by way of images from the mass communications media, as accepted through past associations derived from social and historical judgements.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Stephen|title=(E)race: Symbolic Ethnicity and the Asian Image|url=https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/4900/ubc_1994-0067.pdf?sequence=1|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=1 December 2012|date=December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''(E)race: Symbolic Ethnicity and the Asian Image'' (1993), Stephen Lee describes symbolic ethnicity:
{{quote|From unrelenting integration of outside influences, self-definition becomes less associated with the community as a collective, and becomes more associated with personal ethnicity as self. As the definition of ethnicity becomes increasingly personal, the need to reassert the community associations decreases. Ethnicity then becomes a symbolic identity more than a lifestyle. The definition of ethnicity, as formed by cinema, follows this symbolic pattern. In fact, in most cinema that deal with ethnic integration, ethnic lifestyle is inseparable from its symbolic codes. Ethnic lifestyle is not an associative or collective means of existence, but a symbolic code—an icon.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;}}

In the book ''Identity and Belonging: Rethinking Race and Ethnicity in Canadian Society'' (2006), by B. Singh Bolaria and Sean P. Hier, symbolic ethnicity is defined by, with, and in the actions of "individuals who identify as Irish, for example, on occasions such as [[Saint Patrick's Day]], on family holidays, or for vacations. They do not usually belong to Irish-American organizations, live in Irish neighborhoods, work in Irish jobs, or marry other Irish people."&lt;ref name="Identity and belonging"&gt;{{cite book|title=Identity and Belonging: Rethinking Race and Ethnicity in Canadian Society|year=2006|publisher=Canadian Scholars' Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9781551303123|editor=B. Singh Bolaria|editor2=Sean P. Hier|chapter=Optional Ethnicity for Whites Only?|author=Marcy. C. Waters|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpPgK3bs6YUC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=irish+symbolic+ethnicity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9mDiZahSV-&amp;sig=HPLNXb9MezYyyPhK_Gkmi17dRe8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qWK6UOZYh4fRAeDvgOgF&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=irish%20symbolic%20ethnicity&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the symbolic identity of "being Irish" is:
{{quote|. . . [an] ethnicity that is individualistic in nature and without real social cost for the individual. These symbolic identifications are essentially leisure-time activities, rooted in a nuclear family traditions and reinforced by the voluntary enjoyable aspects of being ethnic.&lt;ref name="Identity and belonging"/&gt; }}
&lt;!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=0C_dk8oMPxUC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Symbolic+ethnicity+gans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jli6UJXdKIHj0gG1_IGoAQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Symbolic%20ethnicity%20gans&amp;f=false
--&gt;
In terms of the derogatory term [[Plastic Paddy]] used to describe symbolic ethnicity in the Irish diaspora, Hickman (2002) states that the use of this term was "a part of the process by which the second-generation Irish are positioned as inauthentic within the two identities, of Englishness and Irishness...&lt;ref name="Marc Scully 2009 p126-127"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, M.J. et al., (2005). The Limitations of Whiteness and the Boundaries of Englishness. Ethnicities, 5 160–182. Cited in Marc Scully. (2009). 'Plastic and Proud'?: Discourse of Authenticity among the second generation Irish in England. Open University.&lt;/ref&gt; The message from each is that second-generation Irish are 'really English' and many of the second-generation resist this."&lt;ref name="Marc Scully 2009 p126-127"&gt;Marc Scully. (2009). 'Plastic and Proud'?: Discourse of Authenticity among the second generation Irish in England. Open University p126-127. Marc Scully. (2009). 'Plastic and Proud'?: Discourse of Authenticity among the second generation Irish in England. Open University.&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective suggests that symbolic ethnicity is a result of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and some assimilated individuals may prefer to explore a culture that they may not have been raised with to a significant extent.

Many displays of what could be argued to be symbolic ethnicity, such as the study of [[Scottish Gaelic]] by the [[Scottish diaspora]] in North America, do not necessarily conform to the stereotype of individuals feeling entitled to a cultural ethnicity due to ancestry. Most Gaelic learners in one study, even those with Scottish ancestry, stated that Gaelic ethnic identity was not related to ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newton|first1=Michael|journal=eKeltoi|page=17|url=https://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol1/1_1/newton_1_1.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2017|title="This Could Have Been Mine": Scottish Gaelic Learners in North America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1963">'''Tag omission''' is an optional feature to minimize an [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]] document. Whenever a tag can be implicitly anticipated by the parser from the structure of the document, the tag can be omitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.is-thought.co.uk/book/sgml-9.htm#OMITTAG Web SGML and HTML 4.0 Explained - Chapter 9&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The tag omission feature can be generally enabled or disabled in the SGML Declaration. The [[Document Type Definition]] is used to enable or disable the tag for a specific tag.

Tag omission is one of the main features of SGML which was removed from [[XML]] to simplify parsing.

== Example ==
In this example the &amp;lt;document&amp;gt; tag has a distinct order of the tags. The information that &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; needs to come first and is followed by &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; can be used to omit the title start and end tag. Furthermore, the end tag of &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; can also be omitted, because it will be delimited by the next &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; tag or the document end.

&lt;source lang="dtd"&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT document - O  (title, p+) &gt;
   &lt;!ELEMENT title O O  (#PCDATA)&gt;
   &lt;!ELEMENT p     - O  (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this DTD specification, the behavior of the tag omission feature is specified for each element by the two characters following the element name. The values can be - or O for disabling and enabling the features. The first character specifies the behavior of the start tag and the second the behavior of the end tag.

A valid document not using tag omission:
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;document&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Tag Omission&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;first paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;third paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/document&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

A valid document simplified by using tag omission:
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;document&gt;
   Tag Omission
   &lt;p&gt;first paragraph
   &lt;p&gt;second paragraph
   &lt;p&gt;third paragraph
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''Teylers astronomical observatory''' (Dutch: '''Teylers Sterrenwacht''') is an [[astronomical observatory]] built in 1784 on the roof of the [[Oval Room (Teylers)|Oval Room]] of the [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref name="MuseumSterrenwacht"&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&amp;id=37 Teylers Museum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718164341/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&amp;id=37 |date=2014-07-18 }} about the observatory.

Hendriks' painting shows that museum visitors used the Observatory to view the panorama of Haarlem and its surroundings.]]
[[File:Reflecting Telescope after Isaac Newton by William Herschel from Slough 1790 - Teylers Oval Room.jpg|thumb|left|Reflecting telescope after [[Isaac Newton]] by [[William Herschel]], built to order in 1790 and formerly used in the observatory]]
[[File:Viervant, Design for an observatory on the roof of the Oval Room of Teylers Museum.jpg|thumb|Leendert Viervant, ''Design for an observatory on the roof of the Oval Room of [[Teylers Museum]]'', drawing, 498 × 374 mm.]]
The observatory was built on the suggestion of [[Jacobus Barnaart (1726-1780)|Jacobus Barnaart]], one of the five initial directors of the [[Teylers Stichting]], which was the foundation responsible for taking care of the inheritance of [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]]. Barnaart was an amateur scientist who had a great interest in astronomy and wanted to build a state-of-the-art astronomical observatory on the roof of the Oval Room. This proved to be a bad idea, because the roof was made of wood, which transfers too many vibrations to make reliable and precise observations. Hence a [[belvedère]] was built instead, a square tower with two doors in each wall.&lt;ref name="MuseumSterrenwacht" /&gt; 

Though the observatory couldn't be used for precision measurements, it was still used for manual observations. The collection of the [[Teylers Oval Room|Teylers physical cabinet]] contains several [[telescope]]s and other devices that were used. Until 1817 the observatory also had a [[camera obscura]], which was used for drawings of the view from the little tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://teylersmuseum.ning.com/profiles/blogs/452-trap-naar-de-sterrenwacht-verwijderd photo of the removal of the staircase in the process or renovation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=T1778&gt;Teyler 1778-1978. Studies en bijdragen over Teylers Stichting naar aanleiding van het tweede eeuwfeest (Haarlem / Antwerpen 1978), p 189&lt;/ref&gt; Though they have not survived, the Teylers archives have evidence that [[Vincent Jansz van der Vinne]] was paid 86 guilders for painting the "walls and ceilings of the cupula".&lt;ref name=T1778/&gt; That was not the only artwork that early stargazers met with when they climbed the stairs. On the rooftop of the first staircase a vase was installed that was delivered by [[Jan Woortman]] in 1781.&lt;ref name=T1778/&gt; Though lost since, the vase can be seen in the painting of the courtyard of the Foundation house by Wybrand Hendriks. The vase was the trademark of Teyler, and is visible on the top of [[Large electrostatic generator (Teylers)|Van Marum's electrostatic generator]] as well.

The observatory can be reached via a staircase from the Grote Herenkamer (large board room), which is located next to the Oval Room. That staircase leads the visitor to the lower roof, where a steep open air wooden staircase leads to the small room on top of the dome. For precision measurements, a new observatorium was built in the garden, that was later used as a studio by the later curator [[Jan van Borssum Buisman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4703">'''The Full English''' launched in 2013 and is an ongoing [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]] (EFDSS) project to create a searchable digital archive of [[Folk music of England|English folk]] song collections from the early 20th century, thereby preserving and improving the accessibility of these resources. The project is supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[The Folklore Society]], the National Folk Music Fund and the English Miscellany Folk Dance Group. An offshoot of the archive, also in 2013, was an album and concert tour under The Full English name by a collective of UK folk singers.

== Archive ==

Launched in June 2013, The Full English is a folk archive of 44,000 records and over 58,000 digitised images; it is the world's biggest digital archive of traditional music and dance tunes.&lt;ref name="archive launch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chilton|first=Martin|title='Staggering' digital folk music archive launched|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10134011/Staggering-digital-folk-music-archive-launched.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive brings together 19 collections from noted archivists, including [[Lucy Broadwood]], [[Percy Grainger]], [[Cecil Sharp]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].&lt;ref name="archive launch"/&gt;

The project has been divided into two parts. The first part of the project involved making manuscript collections available to the public in a searchable online database. The second part, still ongoing, is to improve accessibility by supplying transcripts of musical notation and texts, as well as audio recordings of the tunes. The archive can be searched by various criteria including title, collector, subject, original singer or location they were collected from.&lt;ref name ="Petridis, Alexis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|title=The Full English: on a mission to revive interest in our musical heritage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/25/full-english-revive-musical-heritage|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated the project overall will involve around 15,000 people by the time it is completed, including children learning traditional folk songs and dances and audiences at live gigs.&lt;ref name = "The Full English"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Full English|url=http://www.efdss.org/efdss-the-full-english|publisher=English Folk Dance and Song Society|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical collaboration ==

Folk singer and scholar [[Fay Hield]] was commissioned by the EFDSS to create new musical arrangements, drawing on the archive material, to accompany the project.&lt;ref name = "Hickling, Alfred"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hickling|first=Alfred|title=The Full English - review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/25/full-english-folk-review|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She assembled a collective of musicians to perform at the launch party in June 2013, but after creating a set the musicians decided to extend the collaboration by producing an album and touring under The Full English name in order to promote the archive. The tour visited 11 English towns and cities in autumn 2013. Alongside Hield, other musicians involved included [[Seth Lakeman]], [[Martin Simpson]], [[Nancy Kerr]], [[Sam Sweeney]], Rob Harbron and Ben Nicholls.&lt;ref name ="Petridis, Alexis" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tour&gt;{{cite web|title=Seth Lakeman and Martin Simpson to tour Full English|url=http://www.m-magazine.co.uk/news/seth-lakeman-and-martin-simpson-to-tour-full-english/|publisher=M-Magazine|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the tour, The Full English group performed folk songs from the archive and other traditional sources.&lt;ref name ="Hickling, Alfred" /&gt; They subsequently won two awards at the 2014 [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]] for best group and best album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Full English win two BBC Radio 2 Folk awards|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26254230|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1941">A '''union catalog''' is a combined [[library catalog]] describing the collections of a number of [[library|libraries]]. Union catalogs have been created in a range of media, including [[book]] format, [[microform]], [[Card catalog|card]]s and more recently, networked electronic [[databases]]. Print union catalogs are typically arranged by title, author or subject (often employing a [[controlled vocabulary]]); electronic versions typically support keyword and [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] queries.

Union catalogs are useful to [[librarian]]s, as they assist in locating and requesting materials from other libraries through [[interlibrary loan]] service. They also allow researchers to search through collections to which they would not otherwise have access, such as [[manuscript]] collections.

The largest union catalog ever printed is the American ''[[National Union Catalog|National Union Catalog Pre-1956 Imprints]]'' (NUC), completed in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Who Killed Who?''''' is a 1943 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] [[animated short]] directed by [[Tex Avery]].  The cartoon is a parody of [[whodunit]] stories and employs many clichés of the genre for humor.

==Plot==
A live-action host ([[Robert Emmett O'Connor]]) opens with a disclaimer about the nature of the cartoon, namely, that the short is meant to "prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that crime does not pay."

The story begins on a dark and stormy night as the victim (voiced by [[Kent Rogers]] doing an impression of [[Richard Haydn]]), presumably the master of the very large "Gruesome Gables" mansion, is reading a book based on the cartoon he's in. Frightened, he muses that, according to the book, he is about to be "[[Murder|bumped off]]." Someone throws a dagger with a letter attached, telling the master that he will die at 11:30. When he objects, another letter informs him that the time has been moved to midnight.

True to form, on the final stroke of midnight a mysterious killer in a heavy black cloak and hood shoots him dead with a rather large pistol (''how'' dead he is, though, is a matter of question), and a police officer (voiced by [[Billy Bletcher]], modeled on characters portrayed in film by [[Fred Kelsey]]) immediately begins to investigate. After investigating the premises and the staff, the officer gives a lengthy chase to the real killer, finding the mansion to be filled with many surreal pitfalls, strange characters—including a red skeleton, a parody of [[Red Skelton]]—and [[booby trap]]s that slow and obstruct him. He eventually traps the killer and unmasks him, revealing him to be the opening-sequence host, who confesses "I dood it"—one of Skelton's catchphrases—before bursting into tears.

'''William Ballantyne Hodgson''' (6 October 1815 – 24 August 1880) was a Scottish educational reformer and political economist.

==Life==
[[File:Grave of William Ballantyne Hodgson, Grange Cemetery.JPG|thumb|grave of William Ballantyne Hodgson, Grange Cemetery]]
The son of William Hodgson, a printer, he was born in [[Edinburgh]] on 6 October 1815. In 1820 the family were living at 54 Bristo Street in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1820&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823 he entered the [[Edinburgh High School]], and, after working for a short time in a lawyer's office, matriculated in November 1829, when just turned 14, at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He took no degree as a student.{{sfn|Gordon|1891}}

Initially, Hodgson employed himself in lecturing on literature, education, and [[phrenology]] at towns in [[Fife]]. On 1 June 1839 he was appointed secretary to the [[Mechanics' Institute of Liverpool]]. He was offered the editorship of a Liverpool newspaper in 1841, and that of a Manchester newspaper somewhat later, but declined both. In 1844, on Hodgson's advice, a girls' school was added to the Liverpool Institute, and in the same year he was appointed Principal. On 11 March 1846, he received an honorary LL.D. from the [[University of Glasgow]].{{sfn|Gordon|1891}}

From 1847 to 1851, Hodgson was principal of the [[Chorlton High School]], Manchester. In 1848, he argued for the [[education of women]] at the [[Royal Institution of Manchester]]. In 1851, he travelled abroad, remaining in Paris from October 1851 to July 1852. In 1853 he returned to Edinburgh, giving lectures on physiology, having qualified himself by attending the classes at the College of Surgeons.{{sfn|Gordon|1891}} Because of his work in the field of education, he served in 1849 and again in 1864 as vice-president of the College of Preceptors ([[College of Teachers]]).

In 1854 he lectured at the [[Royal Institution]], London, on economic science and, in 1858, he was appointed an assistant commissioner to the inquiry into primary education, moving to London. He was examiner in [[political economy]] to London University from 1863 to 1868, and was appointed to the council of [[University College, London|University College]]. As a member of council, Hodgson seconded the confirmation of [[James Martineau]] to the vacant chair of mental philosophy; he resigned his seat on the council on 19 January 1867, when [[George Grote]] successfully argued for [[George Croom Robertson]] over the Unitarian Martineau.{{sfn|Gordon|1891}}

In 1870 Hodgson retired to [[Bournemouth]], but in the following year (17 July 1871) he was appointed to the new Chair of [[political economy]] and mercantile law at the University of Edinburgh. He frequently attended the social science congresses, acting at [[Norwich]] in 1873 as president of the educational section. In 1875, he was made president of the [[Educational Institute of Scotland]]. In his political outlook, Hodgson was strongly Liberal, but he took little active part in politics.  He settled at Bonaly Tower, Colinton, a Scottish baronial house built by Lord Cockburn.{{sfn|Gordon|1891}}

Hodgson died of heart disease in [[Brussels]] while attending the educational congress there on 24 August 1880. He was buried at the [[Grange, Edinburgh|Grange cemetery, Edinburgh]]. The grave lies above the central vaults, towards the west, and is the closest to the path.

==Family==

He married, first (in 1841), Jane Cox of Liverpool, who died without issue on 1 July 1860; and secondly (on 14 January 1863), Emily Walmsley (1829-1919), second daughter of [[Sir Joshua Walmsley]] of Liverpool, who survived him, with two sons and two daughters.{{sfn|Gordon|1891}}

His son, Alexander Ireland Hodgson (1874-1958) is buried with William.
