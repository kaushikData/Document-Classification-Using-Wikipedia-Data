'''Akinator''' is an [[online game]] and [[mobile app]] by French company [[Elokence.com]] based on the game known as [[Twenty Questions]] that attempts to determine which character the player is thinking of by asking them a series of questions. It is an [[artificial intelligence]] program that learns the best questions to ask from other players.

==Gameplay==
In order to begin the questionnaire, the user must press the play button and think of a popular character (musician, athlete, political personality, actor, fictional film/TV character, Internet personality, etc.). Akinator, a cartoon genie, begins asking a series of questions (as many as required), with "Yes", "No", "Probably", "Probably not" and "Don't know" as possible answers, in order to narrow down the potential character.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |title=Summer time waster: Stumping the Akinator |author=Jen Chaney |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/celebritology/2010/08/summer_time_waster_stumping_th.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Akinator, el genio que leerá tu mente |author= |url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/tecnologia/noticias/2010/10/19/akinator-el-genio-que-leera-tu-mente |newspaper=Medio Tiempo |date=October 19, 2010 |accessdate=June 23, 2011 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the answer is narrowed down to a single likely option before 25 questions are asked, the program will automatically ask if the character it chose is correct. If the character is guessed wrong three times in a row, then the program will prompt the user to input the character's name, in order to expand its database of choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=アップ・スウェル、『Akinator』のモバイルサイトの提供を開始 |author= |url=http://www.asahi.com/business/pressrelease/ATP201007210007.html |newspaper=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=July 21, 2010 |access-date=June 23, 2011 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; It predicts the answer based on the tree match algorithm. "Aki Awards" can be rewarded for guessing a new Character.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} An update allowed the user to purchase new backgrounds and clothing with in-game currency. Although, things such as animals or objects will not be counted as a real character, even when akinator says it is, and players can decide if they are characters or not based on the rules given to them.

==Critical reception==
''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' rated Akinator a 5 out of 5 on their list of iPhone Apps of the Week for September 9, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paybuddy, Stand o'food et Akinator |author= |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/high-tech/paybuddy-stand-o-food-et-akinator_785566.html |newspaper=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=June 23, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Excite|Excite France]]'' stated that Akinator "is just that interactive. It is revolutionary, attractive, and entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Akinator, vraiment le plus fort! |author= |url=http://digital.excite.fr/akinator-vraiment-le-plus-fort-N2784.html |newspaper=[[Excite|Excite France]] |date=November 23, 2008 |accessdate=June 23, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the game reached its peak popularity in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Tracy Bad Day at Black Rock Color Still 1955.jpg|thumb|left|[[Spencer Tracy]] and [[John Ericson]] in ''Bad Day at Black Rock'']]
In late 1945, one-armed John J. Macreedy ([[Spencer Tracy]]) gets off a passenger train at the isolated desert hamlet of Black Rock. It is the first time in four years that the train has stopped there. Macreedy is looking for a man named Komoko, but the few residents are inexplicably hostile. The young hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth ([[John Ericson]]), claims he has no vacant rooms. Macreedy is threatened by Hector David ([[Lee Marvin]]). Later, Reno Smith ([[Robert Ryan]]) informs Macreedy that Komoko, a [[Japanese-American]], was [[Japanese American internment|interned during World War II]].

Certain that something is wrong, Macreedy sees the local sheriff, Tim Horn ([[Dean Jagger]]), but the alcoholic lawman is clearly afraid of Smith and is impotent to help. The veterinarian and undertaker, Doc Velie ([[Walter Brennan]]), advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but also lets slip that Komoko is dead. Pete's sister, Liz ([[Anne Francis]]), rents Macreedy a [[Jeep]]. He drives to nearby Adobe Flat, where he finds a homestead burned to the ground and wildflowers. On the way back, Coley Trimble ([[Ernest Borgnine]]) tries to run him off the road.

Macreedy decides to leave town and goes to the garage to again rent the jeep from Liz; but she, having been confronted by Smith earlier, denies him the vehicle and drives away to avoid conversation about the strange goings-on in the town.  Macreedy then sits down outside the garage to consider his situation.  Smith comes by, ostensibly to fill his car with gas.  Smith asks and Macreedy discloses that he lost his left arm [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|fighting in Italy]]. Macreedy says the wildflowers at the Komoko place lead him to suspect that a body is buried there. Smith reveals that he is virulently anti-Japanese; he tried to enlist in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] the day after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], but failed the physical.

Macreedy tries to telephone the [[state police]] from Doc Velie's office, but Pete refuses to put the call through. Doc Velie admits that something terrible happened four years ago and that Smith has everyone too terrified to speak up. Velie offers Macreedy his [[hearse]] to leave town. Hector rips out the distributor cap and spark plug wires. Macreedy goes to Hastings' ([[Russell Collins]]) telegraph office and writes a [[telegraphy|telegram]] addressed to the state police. At the town diner, Trimble picks a fight with Macreedy, but Macreedy uses martial arts to beat him up. Macreedy tells Smith that he knows Smith killed Komoko and that he was too cowardly to do it alone, so he involved Hector, Pete, and Coley; Macreedy also warns that when Smith's hoods eventually realize they're being played by Smith one of them will turn against him.

[[File:Bad-Time-at-Honda-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Robert Fawcett]] illustrated ''[[The American Magazine]]'' printing of "Bad Time at Honda", a 1947 short story by Howard Breslin that was adapted for the film ''Bad Day at Black Rock'']]

When Macreedy goes to the hotel lobby, Smith and his henchmen are already there, as are Doc Velie and Sheriff Horn. Hastings arrives and tries to give Smith a piece of paper, but Macreedy snatches it away and discovers that it is his own unsent telegram. Macreedy and Doc Velie demand that Sheriff Horn do something. When Horn tries, Smith just takes away his sheriff's badge and pins it on Hector. Hector tears up the telegram form.
After Smith and Hector leave, Macreedy reveals that the loss of his arm had left him wallowing in self-pity, but Smith's attempt to kill him has reinvigorated him.  Macreedy finally reveals why he is there: Komoko's son [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|died in combat]] while saving Macreedy's life. Macreedy intended to give his posthumous medal to Komoko.  In turn, Macreedy learns that the elder Komoko had leased some farmland from Smith, who was sure there was no water there. Komoko had dug a well and found water. After Smith was turned down for enlistment after Pearl Harbor, he and the other men spent the day drinking, then decided to scare Komoko. The old man barricaded himself inside his home, but the men set the place on fire. When Komoko emerged ablaze, Smith shot him.

Pete sets in motion a plan, involving Liz and Doc Velie, to help Macreedy escape under cover of darkness. Hector is standing guard outside the hotel; Pete lures him into the hotel office, where Doc Velie knocks him out. Liz drives Macreedy out of town in her Jeep, but stops in a canyon. Macreedy realizes he has been betrayed. When Smith starts shooting at him, Macreedy hides behind the Jeep. Liz rushes to Smith despite Macreedy's warning. Smith tells her that she has to die along with the rest of his accomplices. He shoots her in the back as she runs away. Macreedy finds a bottle and fills it with [[gasoline]], creating a [[Molotov cocktail]]. When Smith climbs down for a better shot, Macreedy lights and throws it, setting Smith on fire.

Macreedy drives into town with the injured Smith and Liz's body. The state police are called in. As Macreedy is leaving, Doc Velie requests Komoko's medal to help Black Rock heal. Macreedy gives it to him just before boarding the train.

==Production==
[[Nicholas Schenck]], president of [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews Incorporated]], MGM's parent company at the time, nearly did not allow the picture to be made because he felt that the story was subversive. The film's producer, [[Dore Schary]], wanted Spencer Tracy for the leading role. Concerned that Tracy might not accept, Schary ordered the script changed so that Macreedy was a one-armed man. He concluded that no actor would turn down the chance to play a character with a handicap. Screenwriter [[Millard Kaufman]], a World War II Marine platoon leader at age 25 thought Tracy too old for the role of a former platoon leader&lt;ref&gt;https://erenow.com/biographies/spencer-tracy/28.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

As John Wayne had recently made a film called ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'' the producers feared that calling their film ''Bad Day at Honda'' would confuse filmgoers into thinking they had already seen it.  Kaufman whilst location scouting in Arizona, came upon a post office and gas station collectively known as Black Rock. Kaufman telephoned Dore Schary to ask, "Why don’t we call it Black Rock? And do it in California?”&lt;ref&gt;https://erenow.com/biographies/spencer-tracy/28.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before shooting began, an indecisive Tracy tried to back out of the picture. Schary made clear that he was willing to sue the actor if he quit the film.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Andersen|Andersen, Christopher P.]], p.243&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert Osborne]] of the television network [[Turner Classic Movies]], in the introduction to the film's airing on its weekly segment ''[[The Essentials (TCM)|The Essentials]]'', Tracy, weighed down by his growing alcoholism, refused to give MGM an answer. In order to close the deal, according to Osborne, an MGM executive contacted Tracy shortly before filming was to begin and said, "Don't worry, Mr. Tracy, a copy of the script has been sent to [[Alan Ladd]] and he has agreed to do the picture." The next day, Tracy committed to ''Bad Day at Black Rock''. Ladd, however, apparently never even saw the script. It turned out to be Tracy's last film for MGM, with the exception of ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), for which Tracy supplied the narration. 

Preview audiences reacted negatively to the film's original opening sequence. A revised one, showing the speeding train rushing at the camera, replaced it. The shot was taken from a helicopter as it flew away from the moving train. The film was run in reverse to create the opening shot.

''Bad Day at Black Rock'' was filmed in [[Lone Pine, California]] and the nearby [[Alabama Hills]], one of hundreds of movies that have been filmed in the area since 1920. The "town" of Black Rock was built for the film. Today nothing remains of the set, erected one mile north  ({{coord|36|38|2.84|N|118|2|23.74|W|scale:20000_type:city_region:US|display=inline,title}}) of the [[Lone Pine Station, California|Lone Pine station]], a stop on the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]'s [http://users.innercite.com/kj6ko/railroad.htm Jawbone Branch], which served the northern [[Mojave Desert]] and [[Owens Valley]].

==Reception==
According to MGM records the film earned $1,966,000 in the US and Canada and $1,822,000 elsewhere, making the studio a profit of $947,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

===Critical response===
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine's reviewer wrote: "Considerable excitement is whipped up in this suspense drama, and fans who go for tight action will find it entirely satisfactory. Besides telling a yarn of tense suspense, the picture is concerned with a social message on civic complacency."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788838.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'']. Film review, 1954. Last accessed; February 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bosley Crowther]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]],'' also liked it, writing, "Slowly, through a process of guarded discourse, which director John Sturges has built up by patient, methodical pacing of his almost completely male cast, an eerie light begins to glimmer&amp;nbsp;... Quite as interesting as the drama, which smacks of being contrived, are the types of masculine creatures paraded in this film. Mr. Tracy is sturdy and laconic as a war veteran with a lame arm (which does not hamper him, however, in fighting judo style). Mr. Ryan is angular and vicious as the uneasy king-pin of the town, and Walter Brennan is cryptic and caustic as the local mortician with a streak of spunk. Ernest Borgnine as a potbellied bully (he was Sgt. "Fatso" Judson in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''), Dean Jagger as a rum-guzzling sheriff, Lee Marvin as a dimwitted tough, John Ericson as a nervous hotel clerk and Russell Collins as a station-master are all good, too."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9E01EFDB1F3FE035A65751C0A9649C946492D6CF&amp;oref=slogin Crowther, Bosley]. ''The New York Times,'' film review, February 2, 1955. Last accessed: March 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a storyline she called "crudely melodramatic", [[Pauline Kael]] heaped praise on the film for its direction and cinematography, calling it "a very superior example of motion picture craftsmanship".&lt;ref name="Kael"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kael|first=Pauline|authorlink=Pauline Kael|title=5001 Nights at the Movies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4LzeUZ03vQC|year=2011|origyear=1991|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-1-250-03357-4|pages=46–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bilge Ebiri]] considers the film to be "one of the greatest films ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|author=[[Bilge Ebiri]]|user=BilgeEbiri|number=821567879892140032|date=17 January 2017|title=This is one of the greatest films ever made.

===Cultural references===
The 1980s television program, ''[[The A-Team]]'', had a Season 1 [[word play]] title episode called "Black Day at Bad Rock", with a somewhat similar theme of an isolated California desert town, only this one a present-day town threatened by an oncoming [[biker gang]] out to free its leader and avenge his imprisonment by destroying the town.

One of the cartoon episodes in the ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection]]'' is titled ''[[Bad Day at Cat Rock]]'', a pun on the film's title. The cartoon bears no resemblance to the film's plot.

'''''Battle vs. Chess''''' is a [[computer simulation]] [[computer game|game]] of [[chess]] developed by [[Targem Games]] and [[Zuxxez Entertainment]] and published by [[TopWare Interactive]]. It was released on May 17, 2011 for [[Personal computer|PC]] ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X|Mac]]), [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Wii]] in Europe.

The game was not initially released in the United States because of a lawsuit by [[Interplay Entertainment]] for [[trademark infringement]] due to its similarity to their title [[Battle Chess]]. The case went to trial by jury in the summer of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2010/12/25/interplay-wins-injunction-against-topwares-battle-vs-chess-game/ |title=Interplay wins injunction against Topware's Battle vs Chess game |last=Callaham |first=John |date=2010-12-05 |publisher=BigDownload |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ca.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.20101102_0004919.CCA.htm/qx |title=Interplay Entertainment Corp. v.

Battle vs. Chess uses [[Chessbase]]'s [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] 10 engines to make it moves.  It has no way of setting time controls though, and on the highest level 9 can take half a day to make a single move.

'''''Beneath the Planet of the Apes''''' is a 1970 American [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Ted Post]] and written by [[Paul Dehn]]. It is the second of five films in the original ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' series produced by [[Arthur P. Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.mediacircus.net/pota.html| title=Those Damned Dirty Apes!| accessdate=2011-08-03| publisher=www.mediacircus.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars [[James Franciscus]], [[Kim Hunter]], [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]], and [[Linda Harrison (actress)|Linda Harrison]], and features [[Charlton Heston]] in a supporting role.

In this sequel, another spacecraft crashes on the planet ruled by apes, carrying astronaut Brent who searches for Taylor and discovers an underground city inhabited by mutated humans with psychic powers. ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' was a success at the box office but met with mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by ''[[Escape from the Planet of the Apes]]''.

==Plot==
Following the events of ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', time-displaced astronaut [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Taylor|Taylor]] and the mute [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Nova|Nova]] are riding on horseback through the desert of the Forbidden Zone. Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes.

Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second Earth spaceship has crash landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Its only survivor [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Brent|Brent]], while noting he is in the year 3955, assumes he has traveled to another planet. He encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's [[dog tag]]s. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the [[gorilla]] [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#General Ursus|General Ursus]] leading a rally for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the [[orangutan]] [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Dr. Zaius|Dr. Zaius]]. Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the [[chimpanzee]]s [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Cornelius|Cornelius]] and [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Zira|Zira]], who treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone.

Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. They hide in a cave which Brent soon discovers is the ruins of the [[Queensboro Plaza (New York City Subway)|Queensboro Plaza]] station of the [[New York City Subway]], realizing he traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future. After following a humming sound deeper into the underground tunnels, Brent begins to hear voices telling him to kill Nova. Entering the remains of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], he finds a population of [[telepathy|telepathic]] humans who worship an ancient [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]].

Brent and Nova are captured and telepathically interrogated by the telepaths' leadership under [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Méndez|Mendez]]. They explain themselves to be the descendants of humans who survived nuclear holocaust and mutated over generations. While claiming to be a peaceful society despite using mind-control and illusion on their enemies, the mutants force Brent into revealing the apes' march on the Forbidden Zone; but their attempts to repel the invaders with illusions of fire and other horrors ultimately fail when Zaius sees through it. With the apes closing in, the telepaths plan to detonate their "Divine Bomb" as a last resort, holding a pseudo-religious ritual during which they remove their human-skinned masks to reveal their malformed skinless appearance from generations of radiation exposure.

Brent is separated from Nova and taken to a cell where he finds Taylor. The mutant Ongaro, explaining that they cannot let them leave the city alive, uses his telepathic powers to force Brent and Taylor to kill each other. Nova escapes her guard and runs to the cell, screaming her first word: "Taylor!" This breaks Ongaro's concentration, freeing Brent and Taylor from his control long enough to overpower and kill the mutant. Brent describes the bomb the mutants worship to have Greek letters [[Alpha and Omega]] on its casing, Taylor recognizing it as a [[Doomsday device|"doomsday bomb"]] capable of destroying the entire planet.

The apes invade the subterranean city, making their way to the cathedral; many of the mutants are either captured, killed, or found to have committed suicide. After Nova is killed in the midst of the chaos, Taylor and Brent reach the cathedral as Méndez is shot dead after raising the bomb into activation position. The humans attempt to stop Ursus from accidentally setting off the weapon, but Taylor is shot as his pleas to Zaius fall on deaf ears. When Brent is gunned down after killing Ursus, the mortally wounded Taylor collapses while bringing his hand down on the activation switch and triggering the bomb. The scene whites out, and [[voiceover]] narration states: "In one of the countless billions of galaxies in the universe lies a medium-sized star, and one of its satellites, a green and insignificant planet, is now dead".

==Production==

===Development and writing===
Soon after ''Planet of the Apes'' became a hit, a sequel started being considered by 20th Century Fox. Screenwriter [[Rod Serling]] was consulted, but his ideas did not interest the studio. Then the producers turned to the author of the [[Planet of the Apes (novel)|original novel]], [[Pierre Boulle]], who wrote a draft for a sequel called ''Planet of the Men'', where protagonist George Taylor would lead an uprising of the enslaved men to take back control from the apes as the gorilla general Ursus wants to fight humans. Boulle's script was rejected as it was felt that it lacked the "visual shock and the surprise" of the original. Associate producer [[Mort Abrahams]] then wrote story elements, and British writer [[Paul Dehn]] was hired to develop them into a script, tentatively called ''Planet of the Apes Revisited''. Dehn implemented his trauma of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|1945 atomic bombings]] and the fear of [[nuclear warfare]] on the story. One of the elements thought up by Abrahams and Dehn was a half-human, half-ape child, but despite even going through make-up tests this was dropped due to the implication of [[bestiality]].&lt;ref name=alpha&gt;"From Alpha to Omega: Building a Sequel", ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' Blu-ray&lt;/ref&gt; According to screenwriter Dehn the idea for ''Beneath'' came about from the end of the first movie which suggested that New York City was buried underground.&lt;ref&gt;Russo, Joe and Landsman, Larry with Gross, Edward "Planet of The Apes Revisited", 2001, pg. pg. 103. Thomas Dunne Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Charlton Heston showed little interest in reprising his role as Taylor, studio head [[Richard D. Zanuck]] thought the actor was essential to the sequel. After some disagreement with the actor's agents, Heston agreed to briefly appear with the provision that Taylor be killed and that Heston's pay go to charity. The writers decided to have Taylor disappear at the story's start and only return by the film's ending, and have a new protagonist for the major part of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Russo, Joe and Landsman, Larry with Gross, Edward "Planet of The Apes Revisited", 2001. Thomas Dunne Books&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Franciscus]] accepted the role of Brent as a break from his usual TV fare.&lt;ref name=alpha/&gt;

Director [[Franklin J. Schaffner]] was invited to return to the series, but declined due to a commitment to ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''. Television and film director [[Ted Post]] was approached, and while objecting to the script for "not making a point at all", the producers asked what he did not like. Post then wrote a letter saying that "the loss of a planet is the loss of all hope". Post tried to get the other writer of the original, [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]], but a budget cut prevented him from doing so. Post and Franciscus – who wanted to help clarify the actions of and give depth to the character of Brent – spent a week rewriting the script, leading to over fifty pages of notes suggesting story ideas to fix some of the narrative problems in Paul Dehn's script.&lt;ref name=alpha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russo, Joe and Landsman, Larry with Gross, Edward "Planet of The Apes Revisited", 2001, pg. 105. Thomas Dunne Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roddy McDowall]] could not return for his role in this sequel, because he was in [[Scotland]] directing ''[[Tam-Lin (film)|Tam Lin]]''. Actor David Watson portrayed Cornelius in this film with McDowall only appearing briefly in clips from the first film used during ''Beneath'''s pre-title sequence.&lt;ref&gt;BEHIND THE PLANET OF THE APES documentary, in the DVD box sets.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the animated series ''[[Return to the Planet of the Apes]]'', this film is one of only two 1970s ''Planet of the Apes'' productions in which McDowall does not appear. [[Orson Welles]] was offered the role of General Ursus, but he turned it down objecting against spending all his screentime in a mask and make-up. The part ultimately went to [[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]].&lt;ref name=alpha/&gt;

Before Zanuck was fired as studio president during production, he suggested that Post add an element suggested by Heston, the Alpha Omega doomsday bomb, to end the series. However, before the film's release, the producers were considering ideas for another sequel.&lt;ref name=alpha/&gt;

===Filming===
Production began in February 1969. The sequel, now titled ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'', had its budget reduced from $5 million to $2.5 million because Fox had suffered recently from several underperforming big-budget films, like ''[[Star! (film)|Star!]]'', ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' and ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]''  Nonetheless, the studio expected the film to return Fox to profitability.

Heston's parts were filmed in just eight days.&lt;ref name=alpha/&gt;  The sets of the mutants' council chamber and the temple of the bomb were redresses of the [[Grand Central – 42nd Street (New York City Subway)|Grand Central – 42nd Street]] station and hotel lobby sets from the film ''Hello, Dolly!''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://pota.goatley.com/magazines/cinefantastique-summer-1972.pdf 'Cinefantastique Planet of the Apes Issue' (1972)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The original ''Apes'' composer, [[Jerry Goldsmith]], was invited to write the score for the sequel, but Schaffner was using Goldsmith for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''. [[Leonard Rosenman]] was hired to compose the score.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/1999/08_Feb---The_Great_Apes_Score_Debate.asp ''The Great "Apes" Score Debate'', by John O'Callaghan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704124106/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/1999/08_Feb---The_Great_Apes_Score_Debate.asp |date=July 4, 2010 }} - Film Score Monthly (8 February 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenman tried to blend Goldsmith's distinctive score with his own style, showcased in productions such as ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/cds/detail.cfm/CDID/70/Beneath-the-Planet-of-the-Apes ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' at Film Score Monthly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625005140/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/cds/detail.cfm/CDID/70/Beneath-the-Planet-of-the-Apes |date=June 25, 2012 }} - (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; An official soundtrack LP was issued on the Amos Records label soon after the film's debut in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsnpubs.com/la/amos/amos.html ''Amos Album Discography'', by Mike Callahan, Patrice Eyries and Dave Edwards] - Both Sides Now Publications (June 23, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; For the LP, Rosenman was asked to rearrange his score for a smaller orchestra, adding contemporary elements such as [[electric guitar]] and rock percussion. These re-recorded pieces were interspersed with dialogue taken from the film. The soundtrack featured some of the leading Los Angeles studio musicians of the time, including bassist [[Carol Kaye]] and [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]] pioneer [[Paul Beaver]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaldogproductions.info/a/amos.html ''45 Discography for Amos Records''] - Global Dog Productions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novelization==
The [[novelization]] of the film by [[Michael Avallone]] retained the original scripted ending. Brent does not kill General Ursus. Taylor confronts him and Dr. Zaius. As Taylor tries to reason with Zaius, Zaius condemns him and Ursus repeatedly shoots Taylor with his pistol; Brent's rifle empties and the gorillas kill him. Ursus is horrified, telling Zaius that he has emptied the pistol into Taylor; he should be dead, but he still lives. Knowing he is dying, Taylor (after Zaius refuses to help him) decides to stop the violence by detonating the bomb. This he does, destroying the Earth itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' by Michael Avallone (Paperback - 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic book adaptations==
[[Gold Key Comics]] produced an adaptation of ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' in 1970. This was the first comics publication in the ''Planet of the Apes'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/1953/ ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Marvel Comics]] published a different version in two series (b/w magazine 1974-77,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/2185/ ''Planet of the Apes''] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; color comic book 1975-76&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/2231/ ''Adventures on the Planet of the Apes''] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Malibu Comics]] reprinted the Marvel adaptations when they had the license in the early 1990s.

==Reception==
''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' grossed $18,999,718 (approximately US $118M in 2016) [http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/usic] at the box office.&lt;ref name="mojo"/&gt; The film holds a 40% "Rotten" rating at the film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 25 reviews, with an average grade of 5.2 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beneath_the_planet_of_the_apes/ |title= ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes'' Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has a 6.1 (out of 10) rating from visitors to its [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Beneath the Planet of the Apes|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065462/|date = 1970-05-26|accessdate = 2016-01-28|first = Ted|last = Post|work = IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. H. Weiler]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film was "proof, in living color, that Heston is vulnerable and that a sequel to striking science fiction can be pretty juvenile."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiler |first=A.

Weiler |date=May 29, 1970 |title=The Screen |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' panned the film as "hokey and slapdash," adding, "The dialog, acting and direction are substandard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 6, 1970 |title=Beneath The Planet Of The Apes |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film two stars out of four, writing, "Missing from the sequel is much of the droll humor of the original as well as the adventure. It was a gross error to try to give the series a moral."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (June 2, 1970). "The Sequel Fails". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it a "striking, imaginative picture," adding, "Director Ted Post, writers Mort Abrahams and Paul Dehn are to be congratulated for sounding so timely a toll of doom in such an entertaining context."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Thomas, Kevin]] (May 26, 1970). "Sequel to 'Planet of the Apes'". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that the film was "inferior in every respect to its predecessor—a condition common to virtually every sequel in movie history—but it's reasonably entertaining and fast-moving, a good enough Saturday matinee kind of movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arnold |first=Gary |date=June 30, 1970 |title=Beneath 'Apes' Level |url= |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |page=D8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' declared, "Certainly it's nice to see some of the magnificent settings again, and most of the acting is of a high standard; but this isn't enough to transcend the script's limitations or the virtual annihilation of the original's deftly constructed atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=July 1970 |title=Beneath the Planet of the Apes |url= |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=37 |issue=438 |page=146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3212">The '''Bindlestiff Family Cirkus''' was founded in 1995 by Keith Nelson and Stephanie Monseu. Initially, the duo was named "Fireplay." They toured the world with a mix of [[circus]] and [[sideshow]]. In 1999, the company became a [[non-profit organization]] incorporated as "Bindlestiff Family Variety Arts, Inc." The mission statement was as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Bindlestiff Family Variety Arts, Inc. is a non-profit [[performing arts]] organization dedicated to increasing the knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of the history of circus, sideshow, vaudeville, and related arts through activities including performances, lectures, print media, and workshops for the general public, as well as creating opportunities for cultural exchange and fostering a sense of community.&lt;ref&gt;mission statement from www.bindlestiff.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Juggle Magazine, May/June 2004"&gt;''Juggle Magazine'', May/June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Shows ==

Beginning in 2001, the cirus produced full-length theatrical productions, including "Buckaroo Bindlestiff's Wild West Gender Bender Jamboree" (2001), "High Heels and Red Noses" (2003), and "From the Gutter to the Glitter: A Night Out with the Bindlestiffs" (2005), directed by Michael Preston.

They produced several editions of the ''Cavalcade of Youth'', a showcase for performers 21 years of age and under.

== The Palace of Variety ==

In 2002, the company converted a defunct shoe store just off [[Times Square]] into a performance space called The Palace of Variety and a museum called The Free Museum of Times Square. During the following seasons, The Palace of Variety became the focal point of variety arts in New York City. As many as fifteen shows per week featured the Bindlestiff Family Cirkus and other performing artists. Acts included plays, sideshow exhibitions, [[burlesque]] shows and a [[flea circus]]. The Free Museum of Times Square showcased the area's history. They were forced to close in February 2004 due to the planned demolition of the building.

== Company members ==
Mainstay performers included founders Keith Nelson and Stephanie Monseu, keyboardist Raja Azar, aerialist Tanya Gagne, clown Christine Duenas, musician Peter Bufano, clown Matthew Morgan, juggler Adam Kuchler, drummer Tim Hoey, flea circus [[impresario]] and [[clown]] Adam Gertsacov, [[magic (illusion)|magician]] Magic Brian, [[Stunt performer|daredevil]] clown Jonah Logan and magician MC Scotty the Blue Bunny.&lt;ref name="Juggle Magazine, May/June 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Michelle (2004) ''Burlesque {and the new bump and grind}''. Denver: Speck Press; pp. 107-08&lt;/ref&gt; Other members have included [[Sxip Shirey]].

== Appearances ==

The circus has appeared on including [[HBO]]'s ''[[Real Sex]]'', the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and the Glastonbury Festival.

In 2008, they collaborated with M. J. Loheed to create an online reality show called ''The Bindlestiffs.'' The [[webisode]]s detailed the behind-the-scenes drama as they toured with their political parody ''Kinko For President''.

{{Nihongo|'''''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations'''''|BORUTO-ボルト- -Naruto Next Generations-|Boruto: Naruto Nekusuto Jenerēshonzu|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written by Ukyō Kodachi and illustrated by [[Mikio Ikemoto]]. Serialised monthly in [[Shueisha]]'s [[Shōnen manga|''shōnen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', ''Boruto'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] and a [[sequel]] to [[Masashi Kishimoto]]'s ''[[Naruto]]'', which follows the exploits of [[Naruto Uzumaki]]'s son, [[Boruto Uzumaki]], and his [[List of Naruto characters#Team Konohamaru|ninja team]]. An [[anime]] television series adaptation directed by [[Noriyuki Abe]] started airing on [[TV Tokyo]] on 5 April 2017. Unlike the manga, which began as a retelling of the film ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' (2015), the ''Boruto'' anime begins as a [[prequel]] set before Boruto and his friends become [[ninja]]s in a later story arc. A series of [[light novel]]s have also been written.

''Boruto'' originated from Shueisha's proposal to Kishimoto on making a sequel to ''Naruto''. However, Kishimoto rejected this offer and proposed his former assistant Mikio Ikemoto to draw it; the writer of the ''Boruto'' film, Ukyō Kodachi, created the plot. While both Kodachi and Ikemoto are in charge of the manga, Kodachi also oversees the anime's adaptation alongside Kishimoto.

Critical reception to the series has been largely positive; most critics liked the traits of the main characters, most notably Boruto, who resembles his father, Naruto, but is spoiled and pampered and therefore faces different problems than Naruto did during childhood as a social pariah and an orphan. The story was also applauded for building up the original ''Naruto'' scenario by showing the new generation of ninjas and their relationships with their parents and mentors. [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]]'s anime prequel also earned praise for its use of both new and returning characters. Shueisha has shipped a million copies of the manga series {{as of|2017|January|lc=y}}.

==Plot==
{{See also|Boruto: Naruto the Movie}}
Opening up with an [[Boruto Uzumaki]] facing a foe named Kawaki during the destruction of his village, the manga follows with a retelling of events of ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' with added content. Being the son of the Seventh Hokage [[Naruto Uzumaki]] and [[Hinata Hyuga]], Boruto who felt angry over his father placing the village before that of his family. At that time, Boruto had become a member of a [[List of Naruto characters#Team Konohamaru|ninja team]] led by Naruto's protégé [[List of Naruto characters#Konohamaru Sarutobi|Konohamaru Sarutobi]], along with [[Sarada Uchiha]], the daughter of [[Sasuke Uchiha|Sasuke]] and [[Sakura Haruno|Sakura Uchiha]], and [[Mitsuki (Naruto)|Mitsuki]], [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]]'s artificial son. When Sasuke returns to the village to warn Naruto of an impending threat relating to deducing the motivations of Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, Boruto persuades the Uchiha to train him for the upcoming Chunin exam to impress his father. During the exam, [[List of Naruto characters#Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki|Momoshiki Otsutsuki]] and [[List of Naruto characters#Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki|Kinshiki Otsutsuki]]—the threat of whom Sasuke spoke—appear and abduct Naruto so they can use [[List of Naruto characters#Kurama|Kurama]], a tailed beast sealed inside his body, to revitalise the dying Divine Tree from the dimension they came from. Boruto joins Sasuke and the four Kages—the leaders of other ninja villages—to rescue Naruto. The battle ends when Momoshiki, sacrificing Kinshiki to increase, is defeated by Boruto and his father with Sasuke's help. But Momoshiki survived long enough to realize Boruto's full potential while warning him of future tribulations. After recovering from his fight, Boruto decides to become like his mentor, Sasuke in the future while entrusting Sarada to follow her dream of becoming the next Hokage.

In his next mission, Boruto serves as a bodyguard for the Fire Daimyo's son Tentou with the two finding kinship in both wanting to be acknowledged by their fathers. When a group of bandits known as the Mujina kidnaps Tentou, Boruto saves the boy with the group's leader incarcerated due to having knowledge on the mark that Momshiki placed on Boruto. Naruto and the other lead there is a group called {{nihongo|"Kara"|殻||lit. The Husk}} searching for people with the marks called Karma, Boruto's team is assigned to investigate the mysteries behind Kara while crossing paths with the organisation's fugitive member Kawaki.

===Anime===
{{See also|List of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations episodes}}
Unlike the manga, after the flash-forward showing Kawaki the series begins with Boruto attending the Hidden Leaf Village's Ninja Academy. He learns of his special eye technique, which played a role in detecting contaminated energy in certain people who turned violent. Mitsuki helped in revealing their classmate and friend, Sumire, as the one responsible for contaminating and draining people's chakras. This led to Boruto trying to save Sumire from both Mitsuki and herself, and to bring her back, having to travel between dimensions to do so.

Then Sarada has her own [[Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring|adventure]] where she searches for her father, Sasuke Uchiha, while helping him and Naruto save her mother Sakura from [[List of Naruto characters#Shin Uchiha|Shin Uchiha]].

The Hidden Leaf students then go on a field trip to the Hidden Mist Village where Boruto befriends a ninja named Kagura while stopping an attempted coup by traditionalists.

Boruto and his class then graduate from the academy, being assigned to Konohamaru Sarutobi with Sarada and Mitsuki and they and the other teams begin having missions, one with [[Shikadai Nara]] befriending a criminal named Ryōgi.

The anime also retells the events of ''Boruto: Naruto the Movie'' with additional content that includes the antagonist Urashiki Ōtsutsuki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-12-17/boruto-anime-reveals-new-visual-for-upcoming-chunin-exam-arc/.125393|title=Boruto Anime Reveals New Visual for Upcoming Chūnin Exam Arc|date=17 December 2017|accessdate=17 December 2017|work=[[Anime News Network]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20180105205204/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-12-17/boruto-anime-reveals-new-visual-for-upcoming-chunin-exam-arc/.125393|archivedate=5 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
When the ''[[Naruto]]'' manga ended in 2014, the company [[Shueisha]] asked [[Masashi Kishimoto]] to start a [[sequel]]. Kishimoto rejected the idea and proposed artist [[Mikio Ikemoto]], who had been working as an assistant for Kishimoto ever since ''Naruto''{{'}}s early chapters, to draw it instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook |title= Naruto, volume 6 |year=2005 |isbn= 978-1-59116-739-6 |publisher= [[Viz Media]] |last= Kishimoto |first=Masashi |author-link= Masashi Kishimoto |page= 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title= [[Weekly Shonen Jump (American magazine)|Weekly Shonen Jump]] |publisher= [[Viz Media]] |date= July 2016 |issue=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title= [[Weekly Shōnen Jump]] |publisher= [[Shueisha]] |date= July 2016 |issue=2370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A countdown website titled "Next Generation" was used to promote the new manga. In December 2015, the ''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations''{{'}}s serialisation was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-12-19/viz-english-shonen-jump-to-publish-new-boruto-manga-1-shot/.96703 |title= Viz's English Shonen Jump to Publish New Boruto Manga, 1-Shot |work= [[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170428060345/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-12-19/viz-english-shonen-jump-to-publish-new-boruto-manga-1-shot/.96703 |archivedate= 28 April 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kishimoto said he wanted ''Boruto'' to surpass his own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-12-17/boruto-manga-gets-anime-project-in-april-2017/.110033 |title= Boruto Manga Gets Anime Project in April 2017 |work= [[Anime News Network]] |accessdate= 7 January 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20161217104955/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-12-17/boruto-manga-gets-anime-project-in-april-2017/.110033 |archivedate= 17 December 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer of ''Boruto'', Ukyō Kodachi, had written a [[light novel]] called ''Gaara Hiden'' (2015) and had assisted Kishimoto in writing the script for the film ''Boruto: Naruto the Movie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-05/boruto-naruto-the-movie-reveals-naruto-sasuke-designs/.88930|title=Boruto -Naruto the Movie- Reveals Naruto, Sasuke Designs|work=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=28 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806100323/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-05/boruto-naruto-the-movie-reveals-naruto-sasuke-designs/.88930|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides writing for the series, Kodachi supervises the story of the anime. Kishimoto also acted as the supervisor of the anime for episodes 8 and 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spirallingsphere.com/2017/06/ukyou-kodachi-talks-about-kishimotos-extremely-carefull-supervision-of-boruto/|title=Ukyou Kodachi Talks about Kishimoto’s Extremely Carefull Supervision of Boruto|website=Spiralling Sphere|date=1 June 2017|accessdate=26 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906191750/http://www.spirallingsphere.com/2017/06/ukyou-kodachi-talks-about-kishimotos-extremely-carefull-supervision-of-boruto/|archivedate=6 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Kishimoto revising the manga's scenario, he advised Ikemoto to make his own art style instead of imitating his. Ikemoto agreed and felt optimistic about his art style. While noting long-time fans might be disappointed Kishimoto is not drawing Boruto, Ikemoto stated he would do his best in making the manga.&lt;ref name="frenchinter"/&gt; While feeling honoured to create the art for ''Boruto'', Ikemoto stated he is grateful the series is released monthly rather than weekly because producing the required amount of nearly 20 pages per chapter would be stressful; however, he still finds the monthly serialisation challenging. Regular chapters of ''Boruto'' tend to exceed 40 pages;  creation of the thumbnail sketches takes a week, the pages take 20 days to produce, while the rest of the time is used for colouring images and retouching the chapters.&lt;ref name="voltwo"/&gt;

Despite having a lighter tone than ''Naruto'', the series begins by hinting at a dark future. This set-up was purposed by Kishimoto to give the manga a bigger impact and to take a different approach than the one from the ''Boruto'' movie. In this scenario, Ikemoto drew an older Boruto, but he believes this design may change once the manga reaches this point.&lt;ref name="frenchinter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfmtv.com/culture/le-manga-de-la-semaine-mikio-ikemoto-commente-boruto-le-spin-off-de-naruto-1201304.html|title=Le manga de la semaine: Mikio Ikemoto commente Boruto, le spin-off de Naruto|website=BFMTV|language=French|accessdate=14 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081239/http://www.bfmtv.com/culture/le-manga-de-la-semaine-mikio-ikemoto-commente-boruto-le-spin-off-de-naruto-1201304.html|archivedate=16 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kodachi drew parallels between ''Boruto'' and the post-[[Cold War]] era, stating that while the new characters are living in a time of peace, something complicated might bring the world back to chaos.&lt;ref name="voltwo"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boruto: Naruto Next Generations|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|last2=Ikemoto|first2=Mikio|last3=Morimoto|first3=Mari|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4215-9584-9|volume=2|pages=1|author1-link=Masashi Kishimoto|author2-link=Mikio Ikemoto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Kishimoto is not writing the series, he created multiple characters for the staff to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://otakukart.com/animeblog/2017/01/31/jump-festa-2017-interview-masashi-kishimoto-future-boruto-naruto-next-generations/ |title=Jump Festa 2017 Interview – Masashi Kishimoto And The Future Of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations! |website=OtakuKart |date=31 January 2017 |accessdate=2 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170620152720/http://otakukart.com/animeblog/2017/01/31/jump-festa-2017-interview-masashi-kishimoto-future-boruto-naruto-next-generations/ |archivedate=20 June 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kishimoto did not specify whether Naruto or another important character would die, but he said he would find a situation like this interesting and added that the authors have freedom to write the story as they wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/sounds-like-narutos-creator-just-talked-about-killing-o-1795009454 |title=Sounds Like Naruto's Creator Just Talked About Killing Off A Character |website=[[Kotaku]] |date=8 May 2017 |accessdate=16 July 2017 |last=Aschcraft |first=Brian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711163329/http://kotaku.com/sounds-like-narutos-creator-just-talked-about-killing-o-1795009454 |archivedate=11 July 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebecca Silverman of ''[[Anime News Network]]'' (''ANN'') said ''Boruto'' appealed to her despite never having gotten into the ''Naruto'' manga. She praised how the writers dealt with Boruto's angst without it coming across as "teen whining" and the way Sasuke decides to train him.&lt;ref name=ANN2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-30/the-spring-2017-manga-guide/boruto-vol-1/.116744|title=The Spring 2017 Manga Guide Boruto Vol. 1|work=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=1 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170701034504/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-30/the-spring-2017-manga-guide/boruto-vol-1/.116744|archivedate=1 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy McNulty of ''ANN'' regarded the manga as appealing to fans of the original ''Naruto'' series, adding that while Mitsuki has a small role in the story, his side-story helps to expand his origins.&lt;ref name=ANN2/&gt; Nik Freeman of the same website criticised Boruto's lack of development in comparison with his introduction in ''Naruto''{{'}}s finale; Freeman also said there are differences between the reasons both the young Naruto and Boruto vandalised their village. Nevertheless, Freeman liked Mitsuki's backstory as he did not feel it retold older stories.&lt;ref name=ANN2/&gt; Reviewing the first chapter online, Chris Beveridge of ''The Fandom Post'' was more negative, complaining about the sharp focus on Naruto and Boruto's poor relationship and the retelling of elements from ''Boruto: Naruto the Movie''; Beveridge also criticised the adaptation of Kishimoto's artwork, but he praised the relationship between Naruto and Sasuke as well as the foreshadowing of a fight involving an older Boruto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandompost.com/2016/05/10/boruto-chapter-1-manga-review/|title=Boruto Chapter #1 Manga Review|work=The Fandom Post|date=10 May 2016|accessdate=1 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170701055507/http://www.fandompost.com/2016/05/10/boruto-chapter-1-manga-review/|archivedate=1 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more comical article, ''[[Geek.com]]'' writer Tim Tomas compared ''Boruto'' with the series ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'', since both were different from their predecessors despite sharing themes with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geek.com/culture/what-to-expect-from-viz-media-for-the-next-3000-years-1673964/|title=What To Expect From Viz Media For the Next 3000 Years|website=[[Geek.com]]|date=10 October 2016|accessdate=1 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107112130/http://www.geek.com/culture/what-to-expect-from-viz-media-for-the-next-3000-years-1673964/|archivedate=7 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Nelkin considered ''Boruto'' as a more lighthearted version of the ''Naruto'' series, but Amy McNulty praised its 13th episode for the focus on a subplot that had been developing since the first episode because its revelations made the series darker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anime-now.com/entry/2017/05/16/230044 |title=Boruto Is Basically What Naruto Would’ve Looked Like if the World Had Been at Peace |last=Nelkin |first=Sarah |date=16 May 2017 |website=Anime Now |accessdate=18 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612163429/http://www.anime-now.com/entry/2017/05/16/230044 |archivedate=12 June 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/boruto-naruto-next-generations/episode-13/.118147 |title=Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 13 |last=McNulty |first=Amy |date=28 June 2017 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=28 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630210717/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/boruto-naruto-next-generations/episode-13/.118147 |archivedate=30 June 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart agreed with McNulty, commenting that the developers reached the climax of the anime's first story arc. The villain's characterisation also impressed the reviewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/29/boruto-naruto-next-generations-episode-13-the-demon-beast-appears-review|title=Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 13: "The Demon Beast Appears!"

Critics also commented on Boruto's characterisation in the anime. Beveridge applauded the series' first episode, saying he felt Boruto's portrayal was superior to the one from the manga, while other writers enjoyed his heroic traits that send more positive messages to the viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandompost.com/2017/04/05/boruto-naruto-next-generations-episode-01-anime-review/|title=Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode #02 Anime Review|work=The Fandom Post|date=5 April 2017|accessdate=2 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170701060415/http://www.fandompost.com/2017/04/05/boruto-naruto-next-generations-episode-01-anime-review/|archivedate=1 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/boruto-naruto-next-generations/episodes-31-32/.123784|title=Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episodes 31-32|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=8 November 2017|accessdate=4 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205072430/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/boruto-naruto-next-generations/episodes-31-32/.123784|archivedate=5 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://manga.tokyo/interview/an-interview-with-chihiro-ikki-the-voice-of-denki-kaminarimon-from-boruto-naruto-next-generations/2/|title=An Interview With Chihiro Ikki, The Voice of Denki Kaminarimon from Boruto: Naruto Next Generations|website=Manga Tokyo|last=Kouchi |first=Kanako|date=January 2018|accessdate=15 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316023836/https://manga.tokyo/interview/an-interview-with-chihiro-ikki-the-voice-of-denki-kaminarimon-from-boruto-naruto-next-generations/2/|archivedate=16 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers praised that the returning character Sasuke Uchiha had become more caring toward his daughter, Sarada, the female protagonist of the series, and they felt this highly developed the two characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/24/boruto-naruto-next-generations-episode-21-sasuke-and-sarada-review|title=Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 21: "Sasuke and Sarada" Review|work=[[IGN]]|date=24 August 2017|accessdate=30 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831045904/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/24/boruto-naruto-next-generations-episode-21-sasuke-and-sarada-review|archivedate=31 August 2017|last=Stewart |first=Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics felt this further helped to expand the connection between the Uchiha family members — Sasuke, Sakura, and Sarada — due to how their bond is portrayed during the anime's second story arc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anime-now.com/entry/2017/09/06/230036|title=In Boruto, Sasuke Is a Jerk Who Loves His Daughter|website=Anime Now|date=6 September 2017|accessdate=6 September 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906182539/http://www.anime-now.com/entry/2017/09/06/230036|archivedate=6 September 2017|last=Iikura |first=Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anime-now.com/entry/2017/09/15/230004|title=Sasuke &amp; Sakura’s Marriage Has a Balance That’s Hard to See|website=Anime Now|date=15 September 2017|accessdate=15 September 2017|last=Nelkin |first=Sarah|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916010856/http://www.anime-now.com/entry/2017/09/15/230004|archivedate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/08/boruto-naruto-next-generations-episode-23-bonds-come-in-all-shapes-review|title=Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 23: "Bonds Come In All Shapes" Review|last=Stewart |first=Sam|work=[[IGN]]|date=8 September 2017|accessdate=8 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908204431/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/08/boruto-naruto-next-generations-episode-23-bonds-come-in-all-shapes-review|archivedate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In March 2018, Chinese animator Chengxi Huang posted a video of Naruto and Hinata embracing each other naked. The image got disapproval from young fans as they considered it "gross". Huang's apology stated that the animation was simply practice, and that he wanted to portray the everyday life of a married couple but still deleted the video in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/animator-apologizes-posting-adult-naruto-animation/|title=Animator Apologizes After Posting Adult Naruto Animation|publisher=Otaku Usa|date=January 10, 2018|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10924">A '''caller''' is a person who prompts [[dance figure]]s in such dances as [[line dance]], [[square dance]], and [[contra dance]].  The caller might be one of the participating dancers, though in modern [[country dancing|country dance]] this is rare.

In [[Round dance (ballroom)|round dance]] a person who performs this function is called a '''cuer'''.  Their role is fundamentally the same as a caller, in that they tell dancers what to do in a given dance, though they differ on several smaller points. In northern New England contra dancing, the caller is also known as the prompter.

== Comparing callers and cuers ==
Callers and cuers serve slightly different functions in different types of dance.  [[Improvisation]] in modern Western square dance calling distinguishes it from the calling in many other types of dance.

Callers in many dance types are expected to sing and to be entertaining, but round dance cuers do not sing and are expected to be as unobtrusive as possible.

Standardized dances such as [[Round dance (ballroom)|round dance]], [[modern Western square dance]], and [[Salsa Rueda]] consist of a number of defined difficulty levels.  Callers and cuers are responsible for knowing all of the calls or cues (respectively), also known as figures, for the defined difficulty level at which their dancers are dancing, as well as all figures belonging to lower or easier levels.

Callers for other types of dance may be required only to know the particular dance they are calling.

== The modern Western square dance caller ==
The role of a caller in [[modern Western square dance]] is not only to provide the dance steps which all of the dancers on the floor should be able to follow, but also to provide entertainment through a combination of factors, including programming, showmanship, singing ability, and challenging [[choreography]].

Part of the entertainment factor can come from the caller's use of "[[patter]]" — a set of rhyming words and rhythms that complement the names of the dance steps being called.  Patter can not only be entertaining because it is innovative and surprising, but it can also fill in the space between lengthy dance patterns, helping boost up the energy during potentially dull moments.

There is a large, common pool of patter which callers might use.  Examples are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;u&gt;Allemande Left&lt;/u&gt; with your left hand. / Back to the partner for a &lt;u&gt;[[Right and Left Grand]]&lt;/u&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
OR
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ace of Diamonds, Jack of Spades / Meet your partner and all &lt;u&gt;[[Promenade (dance move)|Promenade]]&lt;/u&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The square dance calls are underlined; all the rest is patter.

Many callers spend time inventing their own unique patter or variants on common patter.

Entertainment also comes from callers challenging the dancers on the floor.  There are many techniques to accomplish this.  This can be done choreographically, for example, by mixing dance calls in unexpected or unusual ways, by varying expected dance patterns, or by calling figures from unusual and unexpected formations.  Callers might also use gimmicks such as calling a common and well-known sequence of calls, and then catching dancers off guard by suddenly changing an expected call.

Occasionally callers make mistakes, or forget what they are doing momentarily, in which case, it is important for them to be able to keep the dancers moving and to bring the dancers back to their partners, and home again, smoothly, and hopefully without anybody noticing.

=== Call types ===
There are two primary classifications of figure types in modern Western square dancing, ''patter'' and ''singing''.

==== Patter calls ====
''Patter calls'', also known as ''hash calls'', are based on a quick and fluid succession of spoken ("[[patter]]ed") or sing-song delivered calls, often to the accompaniment of an instrumental piece of music that it is not necessarily recognizable as a song.  Choreography may appear "on-the-fly" with calls randomly strung together, but it conforms to strict choreographic rules.  Most patter calling is improvised by the caller as the dancers are moving; if the tempo of the calling is done at a fast pace allowing the dancers to flow from one move to another without pauses, it may be called ''hot hash''.

The primary purpose of patter calls is to give dancers a challenge by surprising them with unexpected choreography.

Many callers are very well known for their ability to put calls together to create a unique, smooth-flowing dance.  Some callers are also known for the unusual and interesting formations they move the dancers through.

==== Singing calls ====
''Singing calls'' are based on a sung delivery of calls, most often to a recognizable melody, and square dance calls are mixed in with the song's original lyrics.  Many widely recognized songs have been turned into singing calls.  The primary purpose of singing calls is to help the dancers relax, dance well together as a group, and enjoy the song and the caller's performance.

Some callers are very well known for their voices, and for how well they can perform singing calls.

There is often a very specific format for singing calls.  Most singing calls are structured in an A-B-B-A-B-B-A format, with each section consisting of 64 [[Beat (music)|beats]].  The "A" sections (the beginning, middle and end "break" sections) often involve simple moves done in a circular fashion, with no partner change.  The "B" sections, known as the "figures", are often, especially at the lower levels of dancing, identical, and produce a partner change.  Usually this means that at the end of each "B" section each "lady" moves to the next "gent" to her right.  At the end of the final B section, each "lady" has returned to her original partner.  Variations are occasionally seen; for example, the ladies may move left instead of right, or the last "A" section may be omitted.

Singing calls, like patter calls, vary in dance difficulty, and are rarely improvised in full.  They are uncommon above the [[Square dance program|Advanced]] program, although there are famous singing calls at the highest challenge levels.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Winchester is famous for his challenge-level singing calls. [http://tiac.net/~mabaker/winchester.html Stan Winchester Singing Call Page].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Programming ===
A modern Western square dance tip is composed of a combination of patter calls and singing calls.  Usually one patter call is followed by one singing call to make a tip, although this is not universal.

There are a number of ways that a caller programs the evening's entertainment.  The caller might feature a particular music theme (such as a Rock and Roll party, or a Halloween festival), or might include variations of a particular dance call throughout the night.

Generally callers start the evening slowly to warm dancers up, and to give them chances to succeed during the first tip.  Then tempo and difficulty increases and peaks for most of the evenings.  At the end of the evening there is usually a slower dance number at the end to relax the dancers, and to let them wind down.

=== Training to call  ===
Calling a modern Western square dance requires a number of different skills and some natural talent; becoming a caller requires training— both educational training and "in front of the microphone" practice.

Sometimes people who get the desire to call believe that it is enough to stand up on a platform, and sing the provided text to a square dance song, or call a pre-written sequence of patter.  Difficult as even that can be for some, with some natural talent, a good ear for rhythm and timing, an engaging stage presence, and perhaps a robust singing voice, even a beginner can sound good.

A caller has two main roles:
* Teacher
* Dance caller

As a [[teacher]], the caller must develop their educational skills, as well as the educational materials used in class.  People skills are very important.

As a dance caller, the caller must prepare choreographic material, and must be able to deliver it, whether by memory, or by using written sequences, or by using sight calling.  The choreographic material must conform to a strict, basic set of choreographic rules:  
* Bring dancers back to their original [[partner dance|partner]]
* Bring partners home
* And keep people dancing smoothly and enjoyably.

Caller training is available, and [[Callerlab]] certifies instructors.

==The round dance cuer==
[[Round dance (ballroom)|Round dance]] cuers recite rehearsed, pre-choreographed sequences of figures.  Unlike callers in [[Salsa Rueda]] or [[modern Western square dance]], who invoke an execution of figures in an unexpected order that varies from one run of the dance to another, a round dance cuer only "cues", i.e., hints each subsequent figure of a predefined sequence, possibly already known to the dancers.

The cuer, rather than being expected to call out original, on-the-fly choreography, is expected to know many (sometimes lengthy) dances and lead the floor through each one by appropriately and clearly stating the name of each successive step in the dance just in time to hear it before the last step has finished.  Often cuing is from ''cards'' which list the steps in abbreviated notation.  Cuing each step with proper timing is often tricky, as some dance steps can have very long names ("through-side-close to sidecar" for example), and there are times when a series of quick steps have been placed together, which requires quick speech, while maintaining good diction.

Cuers are not expected (or even encouraged or suggested) to add patter.  Rather, they speak more softly, and as quickly as possible to allow the dancers to enjoy as much of the song as possible. Cuers do not sing, either, except in rare occasions.  Being more calm than most folk and [[country dance]]s, round dance cuers are not expected to entertain; the act of dancing is the primary entertainment.

Cuers are expected to also know the steps they are cuing well enough to teach them.  At most round dances, there are a few pieces that most people know, but it is a cuer's job to also introduce new dances and teach them.  Especially in both very early levels and very advanced levels, it is important that cuers can teach the steps, as several dances are listed as "Phase 2 + 1", meaning that the majority of the steps are at phase two, but there is ''one'' step added in from another level.

==The Salsa Rueda caller==
In [[Salsa Rueda]], [[hand sign]]s are used to complement voice calls; these are useful in noisy venues, where spoken calls might not be easily heard.

== Publication history ==
Comic strip expert [[Don Markstein]] postulates that Link illustrated the strip from the beginning, with the more well-known Smith's name being attached to give the strip credibility.&lt;ref name=Markstein /&gt; When Smith died in 1935, Link's name was credited, until his own death in 1957. Link's former assistant Will Henry then produced the strip until it ended syndication in 1971.&lt;ref name=Markstein /&gt;

The strip was revived from 1975 to 1990 by the writer/illustrator team of Rocco Lotto and Will Levinson.&lt;ref name=Markstein /&gt; The strip was discontinued for good on June 4, 1990.

==Concept==
As with [[Charlie Chan]], in later decades critics took contending views, finding that ''Ching Chow'' reinforced condescending Asian stereotypes such as an alleged incapacity to speak idiomatic English and a tradition-bound and subservient nature. As one critic wrote about ''Ching Chow'', "It wasn’t as much a strip as it was a daily [[fortune cookie]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://bmj2k.com/2011/08/27/the-saturday-comics-ching-chow/&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, ''Ching Chow'' was viewed by many as a secret tip sheet for [[Numbers_game|playing the numbers]] — the panel would appear far in the back pages of the ''New York Daily News''. In a 1978 ''[[Village Voice]]'' article, one believer is quoted as saying, "Why you think ''Ching Chow'' has been in the newspaper all these years? Because it's funny? Hah, hah."&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1299&amp;dat=19780731&amp;id=eA4QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aosDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5084,2267476&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfmu.org/~davem/docs/ching.html|title=Ching Chow's Hidden Agenda|last=Mandl|first=Dave|publisher=WFMU.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, John.

'''Club Paradise''' is an upscale, award-winning [[Las Vegas]] [[strip club]].

The club gained infamy in the late nineties when its owner, Sam Cecola, was indicted for tax fraud and having alleged ties to the [[Chicago Outfit]].  It was revealed that the club served as an outpost and hang-out for many underworld figures including Chicago crime associates.  Subsequently, he was listed for nomination in the [[Black Book (gambling)|Black Book]] and transferred ownership to his wife.  He reportedly tried to control the club while in prison and it is alleged the club is still operated today by members of the Chicago Mafia.  Today, the club thrives as one of the top Gentlemen's Clubs in the country.

It also reportedly has ties to the infamous [[Admiral Theatre]] in Chicago, a known hang-out of Chicago Outfit members, which was previously owned by made-man Patsy Ricciardi, who was brutally murdered and left locked in the trunk of a car in the late 1980s.

Prior to becoming Club Paradise in 1994, the club was known as the Pussycat Lounge, which also gained infamy as being the site of a brutal murder of one of its entertainers.  Prior to being the Pussycat Lounge, the club was a dance club, [[Teenbeat Club]], which was reportedly the first teen dance club in the world and was owned by former County Commissioner Steve Miller.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2730">A family of [[computer]] models is said to be '''compatible''' if certain [[software]] that runs on one of the models can also be run on all other models of the family.  The computer models may differ in [[Computer performance|performance]], [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] or some other characteristic.  These differences may affect the outcome of the running of the software. 

== Software compatibility ==

Software compatibility can refer to the compatibility that a particular software has running on a particular [[CPU architecture]] such as Intel or [[PowerPC]]. Software compatibility can also refer to ability for the software to run on a particular [[operating system]]. Very rarely is a [[Object file|compiled software]] compatible with multiple different CPU architectures. Normally, an application is compiled for different CPU architectures and operating systems to allow it to be compatible with the different system. [[Interpreter (computing)|Interpreted software]], on the other hand, can normally run on many different CPU architectures and operating systems if the interpreter is available for the architecture or operating system. Software incompatibility occurs many times for new software released for a newer version of an operating system which is incompatible with the older version of the operating system because it may miss some of the features and functionality that the software depends on.

== Hardware compatibility ==

Hardware compatibility can refer to the compatibility of computer hardware components with a particular [[CPU architecture]], bus, [[motherboard]] or [[operating system]]. Hardware that is compatible may not always run at its highest stated performance, but it can nevertheless work with [[Legacy system|legacy components]]. An example is [[RAM]] chips, some of which can run at a lower (or sometimes higher) [[clock rate]] than rated. Hardware that was designed for one operating system may not work for another, if device or kernel drivers are unavailable. For example, much of the hardware for [[Mac OS X]] is [[proprietary hardware]] with drivers unavailable for use in operating systems such as [[Linux]].

[[File:Dayparting in the United States.svg|thumb|Approximate U.S. television broadcast dayparts for weekdays ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]). The blank area from 2:00 to 6:00 a.m. is the "[[graveyard slot]]" and not considered important.]]

In [[broadcast programming]], '''dayparting''' is the practice of dividing the broadcast [[day]] into several parts, in which a different type of [[radio programming|radio]] or [[television program]] apropos for that time period is aired. Television programs are most often geared toward a particular [[demographic]], and what the target [[audience]] typically engages in at that time.

==North America==
===Dayparts on radio===
[[Nielsen Audio]] (formerly known as Arbitron until it merged with [[A.C. Nielsen Co.]] in 2013), the leading [[audience measurement]] [[Ratings (broadcast)|ratings]] service in the [[United States]], divides a weekday into five dayparts: morning [[drive time]] (6:00–10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.), midday (10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.–3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.), afternoon drive (3:00–7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.), evenings (7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.–midnight) and overnight (midnight–6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.).

In radio broadcasting through most of the 1990s, dayparting was also used for censorship purposes. Many songs that were deemed unsuitable for young listeners were played only during the late evening or overnight hours, when children were presumably asleep. Even today, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) dictates less stringent decency requirements for programming aired between the hours of 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time.

The drive time dayparts coincide with [[rush hour]]; these dayparts are traditionally the most listened-to portions of the schedule, since these are the times when most people are in their cars, where [[car audio|radios]] remain nearly ubiquitous. Most stations (both talk and music) air local programming in one or both drive time slots. The midday, or "at work" slot, has in recent years become particularly prone to [[voice tracking]], as large station ownership groups cut costs and use supposedly local jocks at multiple stations (often in different time zones). Music stations often are careful not to repeat songs during the midday shift, as they generally have a captive audience, and will often use "9 to 5 No Repeat Workdays" and all-request or specialty lunch hours to lure listeners and air a broader variety of music. Evenings are a popular time for [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|syndicated]] programs, while overnights are generally automated, either with or without a voice-tracked jock, though there are a few niche programs that target special audiences in the overnight and early morning hours (''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'', ''[[Midnight Trucking Radio Network]]'' and the ''[[Orion Samuelson|National Farm Report]]'', among them). On weekends, music stations often air syndicated programming, without regard to time slots (though Saturday nights often remain live with either local or syndicated hosts, especially on [[oldies]] and [[country music]] stations, to take requests) and talk stations air niche network shows or [[brokered programming]]. Religious programming often airs on Sunday mornings.

In talk radio, where voice tracking is impossible and syndicated content is live and national, these lines blur somewhat. ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'' airs in a time slot that is in midday in all time zones, but other than that and overnight shows such as ''Coast to Coast AM'', a show that airs in a slot corresponding to afternoon drive time in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] (for instance, ''The [[Lars Larson]] Show'') would fall into a less-listened-to evening time slot on the East Coast. Similarly, a show that airs during early midday on the East Coast (such as the ''[[Glenn Beck Program]]'') would be aired during the morning drive time period on the West Coast, and may not live up to the expectations of listeners expecting local, informative content. The general solution for this problem is to [[broadcast delay|tape-delay]] programming to fit schedules, though another problem develops where West Coast listeners are unable to interact with those programs unless they stream them live from a station east of them.

===Dayparts on television===
In the United States, dayparting is by far the most common among the [[Big Three television networks]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] and [[CBS]]), all three of which continue to produce programming for a wide array of audiences (a programming strategy known as [[full service (radio format)|full service]]). This is also generally true of other countries where the major terrestrial broadcasters have more general audiences. Cable and satellite channels, most of which cater to smaller niche audiences, generally use much simpler programming strategies: infomercials in the morning, [[rerun]]s (often in [[block programming|block]] or [[marathon (television)|marathon]] format) in the daytime, and feature programming in prime time, replayed in late night (though this structure varies, some channels may opt not to lease out certain time periods to infomercials and program overnight and morning time periods with entertainment programs instead). [[Cable news in the United States|Cable news]] outlets typically program a network-style morning show, rolling news coverage in the daytime with opinion programming or long-form documentaries at night; [[ESPN]] follows a similar format, but with sporting events in prime time, while its opinion programs air primarily on sister outlet [[ESPN2]]. Stations such as [[MTV]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] and [[VH1]] that feature music programming may devote their morning and/or midday blocks to [[music video]]s. Children's channels such as [[Disney Channel]] and [[Nickelodeon]] generally air programs for preschool children during the early morning hours in the form of blocks such as [[Nick Jr.]] and [[Disney Junior]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] carries a similar lineup called [[PBS Kids]], while broadcast networks carry syndicated content; some air older programs (such as reruns of classic cartoons such as ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' on [[Cartoon Network]]) at midday while children are at school, while programs for older school-age children and high school-aged teenagers air in the late afternoon slot. During prime time, programs that are generally aimed at the entire family (such as movies, which Disney Channel often airs) are common. Cartoon Network switches from children's programming content later in the evening to carry adult-oriented live-action/animation block [[Adult Swim]], which runs through late night.

====Daytime====
On [[television]], like on radio, the day is divided into similar dayparts, although the times have been blurred somewhat. In general, [[breakfast television]]/[[morning show]] programs air between 7:00 and 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.; on [[television network|network television]], these are usually long-form news programs featuring entertainment, light fare and features aimed toward women. Until the 1970s or so, children's programs such as ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' aired in this time slot (since that time, however, the school day has started earlier, making such programs less viable). 

After breakfast comes [[daytime television]], which targets college students, older retirees and the ever-shrinking base of stay-at-home moms and housewives; the [[soap opera]], [[tabloid talk show]], [[judge show]] and (much more rarely since the 1990s) the [[game show]] are popular genres in this daypart. In the United States and Canada, a local midday [[newscast]] also airs during the noon hour on most stations as well (this is not always the case; some stations may schedule their midday newscasts up to one hour earlier). PBS and other noncommercial [[public broadcasting]] networks generally broadcast educational programs aimed at children, especially toddlers and preschool children (such as ''[[Sesame Street]]'') throughout the early and later part of the daytime slot, while some show other alternative programs such as cooking programs during the midday period. Cable and satellite television networks generally broadcast an occasional movie during the daytime slot or acquired programs during prime time.

The later part of the daytime slot can sometimes be targeted at children ages 7&amp;ndash;12 and teenagers ages 13&amp;ndash;16 when they come home from school. The U.S. networks [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[The WB]] had children's program blocks during the mid-1990s into the early 2000s, and even prior to that, CBS's ''[[Match Game]]'' exploited this audience to set ratings records in the 1970s. PBS traditionally broadcasts educational children's programs until approximately 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. in most areas. 

From 5:00 to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (in the United States, this can sometimes be as early as 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.), newscasts are usually shown on most television stations. Local news is usually coupled with a half-hour network newscast and possibly a syndicated news program. Unlike morning news shows, these are more generally targeted programs and feature more hard news stories (network evening newscasts, unlike their local counterparts, tend to limit weather and sports coverage unless it is a notable news story). In the United States, stations affiliated with minor networks, or those that have no network affiliation at all, usually air syndicated sitcom reruns or continue daytime programming during this daypart. Following the news, [[prime time]] begins with what is usually referred to as the "[[fringe time|early fringe]]" or "access period" (so named after the [[Prime Time Access Rule]], former legislation in the United States which previously ''required'' networks to not show network-supplied programming in that hour). In the United States (and Canada, to a certain extent), two game shows, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' have dominated this time slot since the 1980s, and they usually compete with syndicated entertainment [[Newspaper|news]] magazines (such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''). Additional local newscasts have become increasingly popular in this time slot.

====Evening====
Prime time is the highest-profile television daypart, from 7:00 or 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 10:00 or 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., depending on the network and time zone. The highest rated programs on television often air during prime time, and almost all scripted programming (except soap operas, game shows, and more recently, [[sketch comedy]] shows) air during the prime time slots. Occasionally, especially during the 1980s and in the 2000s, programs that were "daytime orientated" sometimes enter the prime time daypart, such as the popular nighttime soap opera ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' and the game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''. Usually the main reason for the high profile of prime time television is due to the fact that many people who come home from work and school tend to watch television rather than engage in any other activity. 

Following prime time, [[Late local news|late newscasts]] often air, followed by [[late night television]] programs. Late-night shows are predominantly targeted toward younger male audiences (college students and people who suffer from [[insomnia]] are also a large audience for late night programs) and feature a common format of a male host delivering a [[stand-up comedy]] routine (known as a [[monologue]]) centered around current events, followed by several guests and a house band's performance. After the late night shows, programming varies; this time slot between approximately 2:00 and 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. is known as the "[[graveyard slot]]" due to the extremely low numbers of viewers. Some stations may [[sign-off]] for the night (though this has become less common since the 1980s), air [[infomercials]], or air news or reruns of other programming. In some countries, programming aimed at adult audiences may also air during the late night hours, such as [[softcore pornography]]. In the United States, a handful of cable television channels such as [[Cinemax]] and [[AXS.TV|HDNet]] have used this practice, but this is forbidden on American broadcast television. An exception to this is if the broadcast signal is encrypted; this allowed [[pay television|subscription networks]] that transmitted over broadcast television in the 1970s and 1980s such as [[ON-TV (pay TV)|ON-TV]] to air pornographic films at night.

In North America, Friday nights are often considered to be the "[[Friday night death slot|death slot]]", due to the concept that many shows scheduled on or moved to Friday nights would not last long before cancellation due to low ratings. Some shows have achieved success on Fridays even with the notion of the "death slot" (examples include CBS’s [[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]], [[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]] and [[MacGyver (2016 TV series)|MacGyver]], programs within the now-defunct [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] lineup, and more recently ''[[Shark Tank]]'', both aired on ABC in the U.S.). Other "death slots" include Saturday nights, the 12:00 noon and 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. weekday time slots (at least during the 1980s; both time slots have since been abandoned by all networks and given to local news or syndication), and the time slot or slots immediately opposite popular shows such as ''[[American Idol]]'' or the [[Super Bowl]] (see also ''[[Super Bowl counterprogramming|Super Bowl counter programming]]''). The phenomenon of fewer viewers on Friday and Saturday is in part because most people (particularly the younger viewers that advertisers often seek) are usually not home to watch television on Friday and Saturday nights as they participate in leisure activities on those days, and as a result, programs that air during this time usually receive low ratings. However, some cable channels aimed at children, teenagers or [[pre-teen]] audiences (such as Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and Disney Channel) have experienced success with original programs that they commonly air in the perceived Friday and Saturday night death slots; Nickelodeon in particular, has aired first-run teen programs during Saturday prime time since 1992 with the creation of the [[SNICK]] block (later renamed [[TEENick]] from 2004 to 2009).

====Weekends====
Weekends have a slightly different setup than weekdays. On Saturdays, morning shows share time with the [[Saturday morning cartoon|children's programming meant for that day]], where the networks usually fulfill federally mandated regulations requiring the airing of educational or children's shows (such as [[E/I|in the United States]], where at least three hours of this programming must air weekly across all television stations; although most of the children's programs have increasingly become more live action in nature than animated). Sunday mornings, often known as a graveyard slot (particularly very early on Sunday morning) feature more morning shows, [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs programming]] designed for very small audiences, additional infomercials, [[religious broadcasting|religious programs]], and a series of influential political and news analysis/interview programs known as the [[Sunday morning talk shows]].

Weekend afternoons (both Saturday and Sunday) often feature different sporting events to varying degrees. During the fall, ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC in the United States all broadcast football (all four networks air [[college football]], though all but ABC air [[National Football League|NFL]] football as well), the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] airs on ABC, [[college basketball]] airs on CBS and Fox during the winter and spring, while the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] airs on NBC during this time period. [[Golf]] (on all networks except ABC), [[auto racing]] (NBC and Fox for [[NASCAR]], though NBC sometimes airs [[IndyCar]] racing) and [[baseball]] (Fox) occur during the summer; in addition, sports anthology series such as the ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'', [[Canada]]'s ''[[CBC Sports]] Saturday'' and ABC's ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' broadcast a broad variety of sports with a smaller following. Most stations also find time when sports are not airing to air large blocks of infomercials and some syndicated programs during this time slot. Cable networks and some broadcast stations frequently air feature films during weekend afternoons.

In North America, not many new programs air on Saturday nights, with the focus more on movies, reruns and sports. This is largely due to the increasing status of Saturday prime time as a "death slot", which led most American broadcast networks to abandon first-run scripted fare on that night by the mid-2000s. In Canada, [[CBC Television]] has historically aired Saturday night NHL [[hockey]] nationally under the title ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'', dating back to the early days of radio. Other Canadian networks use the Saturday night slot to meet [[Canadian content]] quotas (a practice colloquially known as the "[[beaver hour]]"). The U.S.-based Fox network established a permanent sports block on Saturday night in 2012, carrying a range of sports including [[Pac-12 Conference]] college football, [[Major League Baseball]], NASCAR and the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] on a periodic basis with reruns airing when sports events are not scheduled (this block displaced Fox's long-running reality series ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'' from its time slot of over two decades); ABC carries [[Saturday Night Football|Saturday Night College Football]] during the fall, then switches to a mix of [[NBA Saturday Primetime on ABC|NBA basketball]], movies, news magazines and prime time reruns for the rest of the year.

In the U.S., late night programming on Saturday features one prominent sketch comedy show, NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', while other stations carry syndicated reruns. Sunday evening is generally treated as a regular weeknight, with popular prime time programs airing. In the United States and Canada, prime time network programs start one hour earlier on Sunday evenings (6:00 or 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., depending on the time zone) than on Monday through Saturdays, an exception to the since-repealed Prime Time Access Rule as part of a 1975 revision that allowed networks to program the time slot on Sundays. No network programming currently airs in the Sunday late night slot.

==United Kingdom==
Weekdays on the major British channels generally consist of breakfast programming followed by game shows, soap operas and lifestyle programmes during the day. [[Channel 4]] has also had consistent success with late-afternoon game shows; ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', airing daily since the network's launch, has been one of the network's most popular programs.

In the UK, Saturday night prime time is usually devoted to entertainment programming such as reality talent shows such as ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in the United Kingdom or drama programmes such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'' on the BBC and ''[[Primeval (TV series)|Primeval]]'' on ITV. Unlike other regions, such as the United States and Canada, some programs aired during Saturday primetime in the UK achieve strong viewership levels.

==Australia==
In Australia, dayparting is not as complex. The breakfast television slot is generally seen as 6:00 to 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., although two of the three major networks have begun morning news programmes at 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. since 2010. Morning television involves a news bulletin and a 'light news/talk' show, often featuring [[advertorial]]s. The daytime television slot adjoins the morning slot, lasting from 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., and features imported daytime programmes from the U.S. (such as ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'', ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' and ''[[Judge Judy]]''), with three of the four U.S. soaps airing in the country (''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' on [[Arena (TV network)|Arena]], after many years on [[Nine Network|Nine]], ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' also on Arena, and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' on [[Network Ten|Ten]]; ''[[General Hospital]]'' has not screened in Australia since 2011). Various repeated shows and movies are also aired.

The early fringe occurs in the late afternoon/early evening, from 4:00 to 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., with children's programming being shown in the early part of the time period, as well as afternoon and evening news and public affairs shows at 4:30, 5:00, 6:00 and 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., depending on the channel. Locally produced game shows such as ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'' and ''[[Millionaire Hot Seat|Hot Seat]]'' air at 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. across two channels. At 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., one channel airs repeats of U.S. sitcoms, while another airs an Australian soap, ''[[Home and Away]]'', and the third airs a light news/talk show.

Primetime is officially, in terms of ratings figure designations, from 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. until midnight, however the peak audiences are between 6:00 and 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Primetime programming is advertised as starting from 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., with more family-friendly programs airing during this time, until classification restrictions allow for racier content from 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. There is a small audience drop off at 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., and a significant audience drop off after 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., with not much promotion given to programmes airing after this time. Late local news programmes only air on one of the three networks. As a result, the late fringe occurs from 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. to around 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., depending on the programme which precedes it.

Overnight occurs anywhere from midnight to 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., and features mostly reruns, home shopping advertorials and religious programs. From around 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. until local news resumes, the three networks air the three U.S. breakfast shows (''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'', ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and ''[[CBS This Morning]]'') in a condensed format with continuity meant for American local television stations removed (the U.S. ''Today'' show is retitled ''NBC Today'' in Australia, to avoid confusion with the [[Today (Australian TV program)|Australian program of the same name]], which airs on a different network than the U.S. show).

===Daily variations===
There are some variations to dayparting based on the day. The highest ratings are achieved in primetime on Sunday to Thursday, although the early fringe holds lifestyle shows before the news instead of game shows. Friday and Saturday primetime, much like the U.S., has lower audience numbers due to the fact that younger audiences are not at home watching television, though this varies depending on the country. Friday nights feature live [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) and [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) matches, as well as less popular series or movies, although lifestyle series ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (TV series)|Better Homes and Gardens]]'' has pulled in high ratings on Friday nights, airing before live sport events. Saturday nights are dedicated to either family movies or programming for older audiences, such as movies or series such as ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' or ''[[A Touch of Frost]]''; AFL also airs on Saturday nights.

Friday and Saturday nights are the almost the only times when programming differs between states, due to the differing popularity of sports interstate. AFL is only broadcast live in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]], and [[Tasmania]], while the NRL is only shown in the other states ([[Northern Territory]], [[Queensland]], and [[New South Wales]]) live.

Weekend daytime is also very different; with the exception of sport and weekend breakfast programs, there are no regular programs.

{{Table Digital video broadcast standards}}
'''Digital television''' ('''DTV''') is the transmission of television signals, including the sound channel, using [[Digital signal|digital]] encoding, in contrast to the earlier television technology, [[analog television]], in which the video and audio are carried by [[analog signal]]s. It is an innovative advance that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since [[color television]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, L. G. (2001). Digital Television: An Overview. Hauppauge, New York: Nova Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital TV can transmit in [[high definition television|HDTV]] with greater resolution than analog TV, in a wide screen  [[aspect ratio]] similar to recent movies.   It makes more economical use of scarce [[radio spectrum]] space; it can transmit multiple channels in the same [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] occupied by a single channel of analog television,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/digital-hdtv.shtml|title=HDTV Set Top Boxes and Digital TV Broadcast Information|accessdate=28 June 2014}} - dead link&lt;/ref&gt; and provides many new features that analog television cannot. A switchover from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2006 in some countries, and many industrial countries have now completed the changeover, while other countries are in various stages of adaptation. Different digital television broadcasting standards have been adopted in different parts of the world; below are the more widely used standards:
* Digital Video Broadcasting ([[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]) uses coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ([[OFDM]]) modulation and supports hierarchical transmission. This standard has been adopted in Europe, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand.
* Advanced Television System Committee ([[ATSC]]) uses eight-level vestigial sideband ([[8VSB]]) for terrestrial broadcasting. This standard has been adopted by six countries: United States, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Dominican Republic and Honduras.
* Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting ([[ISDB]]) is a system designed to provide good reception to fixed receivers and also portable or mobile receivers. It utilizes [[OFDM]] and two-dimensional interleaving. It supports hierarchical transmission of up to three layers and uses [[MPEG-2 video]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding]]. This standard has been adopted in Japan and the Philippines. [[ISDB-T International]] is an adaptation of this standard using [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] that been adopted in most of South America and is also being embraced by Portuguese-speaking African countries.
* Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting ([[DTMB]]) adopts time-domain synchronous (TDS) OFDM technology with a pseudo-random signal frame to serve as the guard interval (GI) of the OFDM block and the training symbol. The DTMB standard has been adopted in the People's Republic of China, including Hong Kong and Macau.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, C. Y., Song, J., Pan, C., &amp; Li, Y.(2010, May).

== History ==

Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It wasn't until the 1990s that digital TV became a real possibility.&lt;ref name="benton"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.benton.org/initiatives/obligations/charting_the_digital_broadcasting_future/sec1 |title= The Origins and Future Prospects of Digital Television |publisher= [[Benton Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, as Japanese consumer electronics firms forged ahead with the development of [[HDTV]] technology, and as the [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] analog format was proposed by Japan's public broadcaster [[NHK]] as a worldwide standard, Japanese advancements were seen as pacesetters that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard—based on an analog system—was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, [[General Instrument]], demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.

In March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced [[analog signal]], but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images. Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being "[[simulcast]]" on different channels. The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.&lt;ref name="benton" /&gt;

The final standard adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This outcome resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—is superior. Interlaced scanning, which is used in televisions worldwide, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. Progressive scanning, which is the format used in computers, scans lines in sequences, from top to bottom. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not "flicker" in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offers a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then (and currently) feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format.&lt;ref name="benton" /&gt;

=== Inaugural launches ===
[[DirecTV]] in the U.S. launched the first commercial digital [[satellite television|satellite]] platform in May 1994, using the [[Digital Satellite System]] (DSS) standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/u-s-satellite-broadcasting-company-inc-history/|title=History of U.S. Satellite Broadcasting Company, Inc. – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eu.indystar.com/story/money/2015/09/04/business-insider-digital-satellite-tv-indy-roots/71611606/|title=Business Insider: Digital satellite TV has Indy roots|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital cable]] broadcasts were tested and launched in the U.S. in 1996 by [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI]] and [[Time Warner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/1997/12/17/technology/nextlevel/|title=NextLevel signs cable deal - Dec. 17, 1997|website=money.cnn.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/1996/08/15/companies/tci_pkg/|title=TCI faces big challenges - Aug. 15, 1996|website=money.cnn.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[digital terrestrial]] platform was launched in November 1998 as [[ONdigital]] in the United Kingdom, using the [[DVB-T]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onhistory.co.uk/timeline/1998/11/10/canal-technologies-and-worlds-first-digital-terres|title=CANAL+ TECHNOLOGIES and the world's first digital terrestrial television service in the United Kingdom|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formats and bandwidth ===
[[File:Digital &amp; Analog TV screen quality comparison-1.jpg|thumbnail|right|Comparison of image quality between [[ISDB-T]] (1080i broadcast, top) and [[NTSC]] (480i transmission, bottom)]]
Digital television supports many different picture formats defined by the [[broadcast television system]]s which are a combination of size and [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] (width to height ratio).

With [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) broadcasting, the range of formats can be broadly divided into two categories: [[high definition television]] (HDTV) for the transmission of [[high-definition video]] and [[standard-definition television]] (SDTV). These terms by themselves are not very precise, and many subtle intermediate cases exist.

One of several different HDTV formats that can be transmitted over DTV is: 1280&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;720 [[pixel]]s in [[progressive scan]] mode (abbreviated ''[[720p]]'') or 1920&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1080 pixels in [[interlaced video]] mode (''[[1080i]]''). Each of these uses a [[16:9]] aspect ratio. HDTV cannot be transmitted over analog [[television channel]]s because of [[channel capacity]] issues.

SDTV, by comparison, may use one of several different formats taking the form of various aspect ratios depending on the technology used in the country of broadcast. In terms of rectangular pixels, [[NTSC]] countries can deliver a 640&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;480 resolution in 4:3 and 854&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;480 in [[16:9]], while [[PAL]] can give 768&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;576 in [[4:3]] and 1024&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;576 in [[16:9]]. However, broadcasters may choose to reduce these resolutions to reduce [[bit rate]] (e.g., many DVB-T channels in the United Kingdom use a horizontal resolution of 544 or 704 pixels per line).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dtt.me.uk Latest snapshots - Freeview/DTT bitrates] (Mendip transmitter, UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

Each [[commercial broadcasting]] [[terrestrial television]] DTV channel in North America is permitted to be broadcast at a bit rate up to 19 [[megabit]]s per second. However, the broadcaster does not need to use this entire bandwidth for just one broadcast channel. Instead the broadcast can use the channel to include [[PSIP]] and can also subdivide across several video [[subchannel]]s (a.k.a. feeds) of varying quality and compression rates, including non-video [[datacasting]] services that allow one-way high-bit-rate streaming of data to computers like [[National Datacast]].

A broadcaster may opt to use a standard-definition (SDTV) digital signal instead of an [[HDTV]] signal, because current convention allows the bandwidth of a DTV channel (or "[[multiplex (TV)|multiplex]]") to be subdivided into multiple [[digital subchannel]]s, (similar to what most FM [[radio station]]s offer with [[HD Radio]]), providing multiple feeds of entirely different [[television program]]ming on the same channel. This ability to provide either a single HDTV feed or multiple lower-resolution feeds is often referred to as distributing one's "[[bit budget]]" or [[multicasting]]. This can sometimes be arranged automatically, using a [[statistical multiplexer]] (or "stat-mux"). With some implementations, image resolution may be less directly limited by bandwidth; for example in [[DVB-T]], broadcasters can choose from several different modulation schemes, giving them the option to reduce the transmission [[bit rate]] and make reception easier for more distant or mobile viewers.

=== Receiving digital signal ===
There are several different ways to receive digital television. One of the oldest means of receiving DTV (and TV in general) is from terrestrial transmitters using an [[Television antenna|antenna]] (known as an ''aerial'' in some countries). This way is known as [[Digital terrestrial television]] (DTT). With DTT, viewers are limited to channels that have a terrestrial transmitter in range of their antenna.

Other ways have been devised to receive digital television. Among the most familiar to people are [[digital cable]] and [[digital satellite]]. In some countries where transmissions of TV signals are normally achieved by [[microwaves]], digital [[MMDS]] is used. Other standards, such as [[Digital multimedia broadcasting]] (DMB) and [[DVB-H]], have been devised to allow handheld devices such as [[mobile phones]] to receive TV signals. Another way is [[IPTV]], that is receiving TV via Internet Protocol, relying on [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) or optical cable line. Finally, an alternative way is to receive digital TV signals via the open Internet ([[Internet television]]), whether from a central streaming service or a P2P (peer-to-peer) system.

Some signals carry [[encryption]] and specify use conditions (such as "may not be recorded" or "may not be viewed on displays larger than 1 m in diagonal measure") backed up with the force of law under the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty ([[WIPO Copyright Treaty]]) and national [[legislation]] implementing it, such as the U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Access to encrypted channels can be controlled by a removable [[smart card]], for example via the Common Interface ([[DVB-CI]]) standard for Europe and via [[Point Of Deployment]] (POD) for IS or named differently [[CableCard]].

=== Protection parameters for terrestrial DTV broadcasting ===
{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}
Digital television signals must not interfere with each other, and they must also coexist with analog television until it is phased out.
The following table gives allowable signal-to-noise and signal-to-interference ratios for various interference scenarios. This table is a crucial regulatory tool for controlling the placement and power levels of stations. Digital TV is more tolerant of interference than analog TV, and this is the reason a smaller range of channels can carry an all-digital set of television stations.{{Citation needed|reason=As far as I know, it's the data compression possible with digital that makes higher channel density possible.|date=September 2011}}

=== Interaction ===
People can interact with a DTV system in various ways.  One can, for example, browse the [[electronic program guide]].  Modern DTV systems sometimes use a return path providing feedback from the end user to the broadcaster.  This is possible with a coaxial or fiber optic cable, a dialup modem, or Internet connection but is not possible with a standard antenna.

Some of these systems support [[video on demand]] using a [[communication channel]] localized to a neighborhood rather than a city (terrestrial) or an even larger area (satellite).

=== 1-segment broadcasting ===
{{main article|1seg}}
[[1seg]] (1-segment) is a special form of [[ISDB]]. Each channel is further divided into 13 segments. The 12 segments of them are allocated for [[HDTV]] and remaining segment, the 13th, is used for narrow-band receivers such as mobile television or [[cell phone]].

== Timeline of transition ==
{{Further information|Digital television transition}}

== Comparison of analog vs digital ==
{{See also|Analog television}}

DTV has several advantages over analog TV, the most significant being that digital channels take up less bandwidth, and the bandwidth needs are continuously variable, at a corresponding reduction in image quality depending on the level of compression as well as the resolution of the transmitted image. This means that digital broadcasters can provide more digital channels in the same space, provide [[high-definition television]] service, or provide other non-television services such as multimedia or interactivity. DTV also permits special services such as multiplexing (more than one program on the same channel), electronic program guides and additional languages (spoken or subtitled). The sale of non-television services may provide an additional revenue source.

Digital and analog signals react to interference differently. For example, common problems with analog television include [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]] of images, noise from weak signals, and many other potential problems which degrade the quality of the image and sound, although the program material may still be watchable. With digital television, the audio and video must be synchronized digitally, so reception of the digital signal must be very nearly complete; otherwise, neither audio nor video will be usable. Short of this complete failure, "blocky" video is seen when the digital signal experiences interference.

Analog TV began with monophonic sound, and later developed [[multichannel television sound]] with two independent audio signal channels. DTV allows up to 5 audio signal channels plus a [[sub-woofer]] bass channel, with broadcasts similar in quality to movie theaters and DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/crashcourse/digital_v_analog/sound.html |title=Digital TV: A Cringley Crash Course&amp;nbsp;— Digital Vs. Analog |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compression artifacts, picture quality monitoring, and allocated bandwidth ===
DTV images have some picture defects that are not present on analog television or motion picture cinema, because of present-day limitations of bit rate and compression algorithms such as [[MPEG-2]]. This defect is sometimes referred to as "[[mosquito noise]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |author1=Le Dinh, Phuc-Tue |author2=Patry, Jacques | url=http://www.videsignline.com/howto/180207350
 | title=Video compression artifacts and MPEG noise reduction
 | work=Video Imaging DesignLine | date=February 24, 2006
 | accessdate=April 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the way the human visual system works, defects in an image that are localized to particular features of the image or that come and go are more perceptible than defects that are uniform and constant. However, the DTV system is designed to take advantage of other limitations of the human visual system to help mask these flaws, e.g. by allowing more [[compression artifacts]] during fast motion where the eye cannot track and resolve them as easily and, conversely, minimizing artifacts in still backgrounds that may be closely examined in a scene (since time allows).

Broadcast, cable, satellite, and Internet DTV operators control the picture quality of television signal encodes using sophisticated, neuroscience-based algorithms, such as the structural similarity ([[SSIM]]) video quality measurement tool, which was accorded each of its inventors a [[Primetime Emmy]] because of its global use. Another tool, called [[Visual Information Fidelity (VIF)]], is a top-performing algorithm at the core of the [[Netflix]] [[VMAF]] video quality monitoring system, which accounts for about 35% of all U.S. bandwidth consumption.

=== Effects of poor reception ===
Changes in signal reception from factors such as degrading antenna connections or changing weather conditions may gradually reduce the quality of analog TV. The nature of digital TV results in a perfectly decodable video initially, until the receiving equipment starts picking up interference that overpowers the desired signal or if the signal is too weak to decode. Some equipment will show a garbled picture with significant damage, while other devices may go directly from perfectly decodable video to no video at all or lock up. This phenomenon is known as the digital [[cliff effect]].\\

[[Block error]] may occur when transmission is done with compressed images. A block error in a single frame often results in black boxes in several subsequent frames, making viewing difficult.

For remote locations, distant channels that, as analog signals, were previously usable in a snowy and degraded state may, as digital signals, be perfectly decodable or may become completely unavailable. The use of higher frequencies will add to these problems, especially in cases where a clear line-of-sight from the receiving antenna to the transmitter is not available.

=== Effect on old analog technology ===
{{Update|section|date=February 2017}}
Television sets with only analog tuners cannot decode digital transmissions. When analog broadcasting over the air ceases, users of sets with analog-only tuners may use other sources of programming (e.g. cable, recorded media) or may purchase set-top converter boxes to tune in the digital signals. In the United States, a [[Coupon-eligible converter box|government-sponsored coupon]] was available to offset the cost of an external converter box. Analog switch-off (of full-power stations) took place on December 11, 2006 in The Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/sloot/switch-off.pdf |title=How Television went Digital in The Netherlands |accessdate=2013-02-04 |format=PDF |work=Open Society Foundations September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; June 12, 2009 in the United States for full-power stations, and later for Class-A Stations on September 1, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtv.gov/affected.html |title=The Digital TV Transition: Will You Be Affected? |accessdate=2009-11-02 |work=FCC }}&lt;/ref&gt; July 24, 2011 in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/BC_DC_Eggerton_on_Washington/15430-New_DTV_Hard_Date_July_24_2011_.php |title=New DTV Hard Date: July 24, 2011? |accessdate=2009-11-02 |work=B&amp;C }}&lt;/ref&gt; August 31, 2011 in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/DTV_PLAN_Dec08-e.pdf/$file/DTV_PLAN_Dec08-e.pdf |title=DTV Post-Transition Allotment Plan |accessdate=2009-11-02 |format=PDF |work=Spectrum Management and Telecommunications }}&lt;/ref&gt; February 13, 2012 in Arab states, May 1, 2012 in Germany, October 24, 2012 in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/82057/24-10-12_DSO_completion.pdf |title=End of analogue TV era as switchover completes in the UK |accessdate=2012-12-21 |work=Digital UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saorview.ie/news/analogue-switch-off-has-finally-happened/|title=Analogue switch off has finally happened|accessdate=2012-12-21 |work=SAORVIEW}}&lt;/ref&gt; October 31, 2012 in selected Indian cities,&lt;ref name="india-switchover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalindiamib.com/digital_switch_over.html |title=Find out when digital switch over is coming to you |accessdate=2012-12-21 |work=Government of India Ministry of Information &amp; Broadcasting }}&lt;/ref&gt; and December 10, 2013 in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalready.gov.au/|title=Australia's ready for digital TV |accessdate=2013-12-25 |work=Digital Ready AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of analog switch-off is scheduled for December 31, 2017 in the whole of India,&lt;ref name="india-switchover"/&gt; December 2018 in Costa Rica and around 2020 for the Philippines.

=== Disappearance of TV-audio receivers ===
Prior to the conversion to digital TV, analog television broadcast audio for TV channels on a separate FM [[carrier signal]] from the video signal. This FM audio signal could be heard using standard radios equipped with the appropriate tuning circuits.

However, after the [[digital television transition|transition of many countries to digital TV]], no portable radio manufacturer has yet developed an alternative method for portable radios to play just the audio signal of digital TV channels. ([[DTV radio]] is not the same thing.)

=== Environmental issues ===
The adoption of a broadcast standard incompatible with existing analog receivers has created the problem of large numbers of analog receivers being discarded during [[digital television transition]]. One superintendent of public works was quoted in 2009 saying; "some of the studies I’ve read in the trade magazines say up to a quarter of American households could be throwing a TV out in the next two years following the regulation change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonawanda-news.com/local/local_story_027233552.html North Tonawanda: council discusses future TV disposal], Neale Gulley, Tonawanda News, January 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, an estimated 99 million analog TV receivers were sitting unused in homes in the US alone and, while some obsolete receivers are being retrofitted with converters, many more are simply dumped in [[landfill]]s where they represent a source of toxic metals such as [[lead]] as well as lesser amounts of materials such as [[barium]], [[cadmium]] and [[chromium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wltx.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=69896&amp;catid=306 Old Toxic TVs Cause Problems], USA TODAY, January 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/38198929.html Unloading that old TV not quite so simple], Lee Bergquist, [[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]], January 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one campaign group, a [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] [[computer monitor]] or TV contains an average of {{convert|8|lb|kg}} of lead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7820229.stm Campaigners highlight 'toxic TVs'], Maggie Shiels, [[BBC News]], 9 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to another source, the lead in glass of a CRT varies from 1.08&amp;nbsp;lb to 11.28&amp;nbsp;lb, depending on screen size and type, but the lead is in the form of "stable and immobile" lead oxide mixed into the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead in Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) Information Sheet** |date=2001-11-30 |url=http://www.premierinc.com/quality-safety/tools-services/safety/topics/computers/downloads/k_3_lead_in_crts.pdf |format=PDF |page=1 |publisher=[[Electronic Industries Alliance]] |accessdate=2009-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520124802/http://premierinc.com/quality-safety/tools-services/safety/topics/computers/downloads/k_3_lead_in_crts.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that the lead can have long-term negative effects on the environment if dumped as landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C.S. |last=Poon |title=Management of CRT glass from discarded computer monitors and TV sets |year=2008 |journal=Waste Management |volume=28 |pages=1499–1499 |url=http://ewasteguide.info/biblio/management-cr |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2008.06.001 |quote=number of studies have demonstrated that the neck and funnel glasses of CRT are hazardous wastes, while the panel glass exhibits little toxicity. |accessdate=2009-09-29 |pmid=18571917 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the glass envelope can be recycled at suitably equipped facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcsh6.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=99680&amp;catid=2 What To Do With Your Old TV's], Mike Webster, [[WCSH-TV]], January 28, 2009 - dead link&lt;/ref&gt; Other portions of the receiver may be subject to disposal as [[hazardous material]].

Local restrictions on disposal of these materials vary widely; in some cases [[second-hand store]]s have refused to accept working color television receivers for resale due to the increasing costs of disposing of unsold TVs. Those [[thrift store]]s which are still accepting donated TVs have reported significant increases in good-condition working used television receivers abandoned by viewers who often expect them not to work after digital transition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/custom/consumer/sfl-flhlpvasquez0119sbjan19,0,4669489.column Many people throwing out perfectly good TVs over digital confusion], Daniel Vasquez, Sun-Sentinel, Florida, January 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In Michigan in 2009, one recycler estimated that as many as one household in four would dispose of or recycle a TV set in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090123/METRO/901230383 Trashing the tube: Digital conversion may spark glut of toxic waste], Jennifer Chambers, [[Detroit News]], January 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The digital television transition, migration to [[high-definition television]] receivers and the replacement of CRTs with flatscreens are all factors in the increasing number of discarded analog CRT-based television receivers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1673">The '''dove pan''' is a classic [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] effect in which a magician produces a [[dove]] from an empty pan.  The illusion continues to be performed by professional and amateur magicians.

The effect consists of a shallow pan made of [[brass]] or [[aluminium]] and a matching lid which has a very deep rim or shoulder all around that fits inside the pan when closed. The pan is usually no more than ten inches in diameter and roughly 2-3 inches deep.  Dove pans are a common item at magicians' supply stores.

In presentation, the magician demonstrates that the pan is empty and then fills it with a small quantity of a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] liquid which is ignited.  Often, the magician will place other items in the pan (''e.g.'' cracking an [[egg (food)|egg]] into it) before setting the fuel on fire.  To extinguish the fire, the magician slams the lid onto the pan.  When the magician removes the lid, a dove flies from the pan which is shown to be otherwise empty.

==Method==
The [[gimmick]] of the dove pan lies in the design of the lid. The deep shouldered rim of the lid conceals an additional pan (or liner) that fits snugly into the main pan. When the lid is placed on the pan the liner is deposited inside it, resembling the main pan when it was displayed empty. The liner, when fitted into the lid, may be loaded with birds (or anything else the magician wishes to produce) before the trick begins. The magician must not show the underside of the lid to the audience while performing the trick.

'''Eli Finish''' ({{lang-he|אלי פיניש}}, born 17 July 1975) is an [[Israel]]i actor and [[comedian]]. He is well known for acting in the popular TV show [[Eretz Nehederet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelhayom.co.il/site/newsletter_article.php?id=8392 המאליכ של הצחוק]. Israel Today. 10.08.2010 (In Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After his release from the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] in 1996, Finish studied acting in the art school HaBustan in [[Netanya]]. He also appeared in [[Dudu Topaz]]'s stand-up comedy show called The First in Entertainment with [[Mariano Idelman]] in the same year, and signed a 2-year contract with the show.

Finish and Idelman continued working together with a stand-up act called ''Ovrim Al HaTzhok'' (a word play on ''Ovrim Al HaHok'', Hebrew for "breaking the law"), and in 2001 created their own show named ''Ahla Seret'' ("A Great Movie"). In 2002 they released a 'best moments' DVD. In the same year, they appeared in a show on [[Bip (channel)|Bip]] called ''Lo Nafsik Litzhok'' ("(We) Won't Stop Laughing") along with [[Tal Friedman]], [[Asi Cohen]] and [[Rotem Abuhav]]. The first two continued with Finish and Idelman to Eretz Nehederet in 2003.

In 2005, Finish played his first non-comic character in the TV series ''Heder Milhama'' ("War Room"), and continued as an actor in the show ''Lo Hivtahti Lakh'' ("I Didn't Promise You") in 2006.

===Eretz Nehederet===
Eli Finish began his career starring in Eretz Nehederet in 2003, along with Mariano Idelman, Tal Friedman, Asi Cohen, [[Orna Banai]], [[Eyal Kitzis]], etc. He has parodied numerous real-life persons, including [[Shimon Peres]], [[Moshe Katzav]] and [[Amir Peretz]].

'''''G.I. Combat''''' was an American [[comics anthology]] featuring [[war comics|war stories]]. It was published from 1952 until 1956 by [[Quality Comics]], followed by [[DC Comics]] until its final issue in 1987. In 2012 it was briefly revived.

==Publication history==
The focus was on stories about American soldiers or [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]]s.  Initially, the stories involved [[Cold War]] adventures with strong [[anti-Communist]] themes, but over time the focus shifted to tales from [[World War II]], and most of the stories after Quality ceased publishing the title were set during this period.  As with other media, the World War II setting was sometimes used to discuss themes pertinent to contemporary conflicts such as the [[Vietnam War]].

The first issue of ''G.I. Combat'' was published in October 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id= 879|title= ''G.I. Combat'' (Quality Comics)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When DC Comics acquired the rights to the Quality Comics characters and titles, they continued publishing the series starting with issue #44 (January 1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id= 1245|title= ''G.I. Combat'' (DC Comics)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''G.I. Combat'' and ''[[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]]'' were the only Quality titles which DC continued publishing. Many notable writers and artists worked on ''G.I. Combat'' during its run, including [[Robert Kanigher]], who also edited the title, [[Joe Kubert]], [[Jerry Grandenetti]] and [[Neal Adams]].

Each issue of ''G.I. Combat'' contained several short comic stories, a format that continued throughout its run. There were several recurring features in the DC Comics version of the title, including most notably "The [[Haunted Tank]]", which first appeared in issue #87 (May 1961)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 103|quote= ''G.I. Combat'' #87 saw Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart guide Lt. Jeb Stuart and the Haunted Tank on their first adventure by scribe Robert Kanigher and artist Russ Heath.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran until 1987. [[The Losers (comics)|The Losers]]' first appearance as a group was with the Haunted Tank crew in issue #138 (Oct.-Nov. 1969),&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 135: "Scribe Robert Kanigher and artist Russ Heath turned these self-described Losers - including "Navajo Ace" Johnny Cloud of the U.S. Army Air Force, Marines Gunner Mackey and Sarge Clay, and Captain William Storm, a PT boat commander with a prosthetic leg - into a fighting force that meshed as one."&lt;/ref&gt; in a story titled "The Losers". Other recurring features included "The Bravos of Vietnam" (about U.S. Marines in the Vietnam War) and late in its run, a return to Cold War themes with a short-lived recurring feature about 1980s [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Beginning with issue #201 (April–May 1977), ''G.I. Combat'' was DC's only war comic to be upgraded to its "[[Dollar Comics]]" line, with additional pages of content beyond the then-standard 32-page format.  The Dollar Comic format was used through issue #259 (November 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Romero|first = Max|title = I'll Buy That For a Dollar! DC Comics' Dollar Comics|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 57|pages = 39–41|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = July 2012|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series continued in a 52-page giant-sized format through issue #281 (January 1986)&lt;ref&gt;{{Gcdb issue|id= 40946|title= ''G.I. Combat'' #281}}&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to a standard 32 page size with #282 (March 1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{Gcdb issue|id= 41171|title= ''G.I. Combat'' #282}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]]'s first full appearance was in ''G.I. Combat'' #274 (February 1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Robert Kanigher|Kanigher, Robert]]|penciller= [[Sam Glanzman|Glanzman, Sam]]|inker= Glanzman, Sam|story= Death March|title= G.I.

Rock]]'', ''The [[Unknown Soldier (DC Comics)|Unknown Soldier]]'', and ''[[Weird War Tales]]'' were discontinued.  ''G.I. Combat'''s final issue was #288 (March 1987).

=== 2012 series ===
DC launched a new ''G.I. Combat'' ongoing series ([[cover date]]d July 2012) as part of [[The New 52]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/dc-adds-6-titles-including-modern-gi-combat-065141967.html |title=DC adds 6 new titles, including modern ''G.I.

== Company background ==

Gossip Center was created in March 2003 by a network of girls located in Los Angeles, New York City, and the [[Midwest]] who were passionate about celebrity gossip. It originally operated under the [[URL]] of celebrity-gossip.net, but this was changed when Brand Technologies acquired Gossip Girls in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gossipCenter Gossip Center Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, it has participated in the [[Glam Media|Glam Media Network]] and now syndicates video to its entertainment section along with other providers such as [[E! Online]] and [[TV Guide]].

== Content ==

Gossip Center publishes over 30 original stories and between 200-600 images each day. It routinely covers the most popular celebrities of the moment, such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Brad Pitt]], and [[Vanessa Hudgens]], but unlike many of its competitors, such as [[Dlisted]] and [[Perez Hilton]], it portrays them in a neutral or positive light.

The film was released to cinemas in United Kingdom on June 10, 2011 and on direct to DVD in the United States on February 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/461876/Honey-2/overview |title=Honey-2 - Trailer - Cast - Showtimes - NYTimes.com |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was followed by a sequel, ''[[Honey 3: Dare to Dance]]'' (2016).

== Plot ==
17-year-old Maria Bennett ([[Kat Graham]]) returns from prison to rebuild her life with nothing but a talent for street dance and a burning ambition to prove herself. She finds refuge in the place that made her feel most alive as a kid at the rec center where Honey's exuberant classes first ignited her passion for dance. Keeping on the straight and narrow means living with Honey's mother Connie ([[Lonette McKee]]) and holding down a job just to make ends meet. She joins the HD crew to give pay back to her old crew (the 718 Crew) and ex-boyfriend Luis (Christopher Martinez) after realizing the bad influence they had on her. She convinces them to audition to compete on the television dance competition "Dance Battlezone" which means going up against the 718.

}}'''Hyper Hippo Productions''' is a Canadian online video game and software development company. It was co-founded by [[Club Penguin]] founder Lance Priebe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hyperhippo.ca|title=Lance Priebe - Hyper Hippo|first=|last=|coauthor=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pascale Audette, a former employee of [[Disney Online Studios Canada]]. Their current most popular games include ''[[Adventure Capitalist (video game)|AdVenture Capitalist]]'' and ''Wild Warfare'', among many others.

== History ==
Hyper Hippo was founded by Lance Priebe and Pascale Audette in late 2012. Its original purpose was to expand the size of Priebe's old studio, RocketSnail Games, which is today used as a personal studio for independent projects by Priebe. Hyper Hippo formally inherited all of RocketSnail's projects, including ''[[Mech Mice]]'' and ''Leviathans Online''.

In November 2012, [[Catalyst Game Labs]] announced a partnership with Hyper Hippo to create ''Leviathans Online''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catalystgamelabs.com/2012/11/21/catalyst-teaming-with-hyper-hippo-productions-to-develop-leviathans-online/|title=Catalyst, Hyper Hippo Productions to develop Leviathans Online|first=|last=|coauthor=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in December 2012, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'''s [[GeekDad]] also reported about Catalyst Games and Hyper Hippo Games possibly partnering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/12/leviathans-online/ |title=Leviathans Online GeekDad  Wired.com |first= |last= |coauthor= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=September 15, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204195242/http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/12/leviathans-online/ |archivedate=December 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, they published a revamped version of browser game ''[[Adventure Capitalist (video game)|AdVenture Capitalist]]'' for mobile.

In February 2016, [[Jagex Limited]] announced a partnership with Hyper Hippo to create ''RuneScape: Idle Adventures''&lt;ref&gt;http://services.runescape.com/m=news/runescape-idle-adventures--coming-spring-2016&lt;/ref&gt; a spin-off of ''[[RuneScape]]'' described as a quick to play RPG boiled down to the basics where your character will progress in real time. On September 1, 2016 an early access beta was released through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on PC. It was planned to also be available on tablet and mobile. It was removed from Steam, however, on May 15, 2017.

The International Fellowship of Christian Magicians was formed in 1953 by a group of individuals interested in sharing the Gospel using sleight of hand illusions.  Since it’s humble California beginnings it has grown into an international organization with thousands of members from all walks of life.  These members aren't only performers of Gospel magic, but also entertainers across the world, secular and gospel, that are members of the Christian faith.  Notable members include entertainers like [[André Kole|Andres Kole]], [[Justin Flom]], [[Duane Laflin]], and others.
[[File:Fellowship of Christian Magicians Photo.jpg|thumb|Photos from International Conference in Nashville, TN]]
Many of its members are involved in ministries that not only share the Gospel and entertain through the use of illusions but also by using puppetry, ventriloquism, clowning, balloon sculpturing, drama, storytelling, chalk art, face art, juggling and other visual arts; as a result they include all these art forms at our training conventions, regional conferences and in our magazine, The Voice.

The '''International Fellowship of Christian Magicians''' has an annual [[Magic convention|convention]] that moves across the country, but is currently held in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Their website is found at www.FCM.org.

The current President of the organization is Joey Evans.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Kokkuri'''''|こっくり, 狐狗狸}} or {{nihongo|''Kokkuri-san''|こっくりさん}} is a Japanese game popular during the [[Meiji period]] that is also a form of [[divination]], based partially on Western [[table-turning]].  The name ''kokkuri'' is an [[onomatopoeia]] meaning "to nod up and down", and refers to the movement of the actual kokkuri mechanism.  The kanji used to write the word is an [[ateji]], although its characters reflect the popular belief that the movement of the mechanism is caused by supernatural agents (''ko'' 狐, [[kitsune|foxes]]; ''ku'' 狗, [[tengu]]; ''ri'' 狸, [[tanuki]]).

The word ''kokkuri'' refers to the game, the actual physical apparatus, and the spirit(s) believed to possess the apparatus in order to communicate with humans.  The physical mechanism is composed of three bamboo rods arranged to make a tripod, upon which is placed a small pot, which is covered by a cloth.  Three or more people will place their hands upon the kokkuri and ask the spirits a question, which that spirit will in theory answer by moving the pot or remaining still.

Japanese folklorist [[Inoue Enryō]] wrote about the kokkuri phenomenon, denouncing it as mere superstition, yet his efforts did not succeed in depopularizing the game.  Some scientific figures of the age attempted to explain the phenomena with the more scientific sounding yet ultimately equally mysterious term "human electricity".

==In popular culture==
*Tamamura Tamao from the ''[[Shaman King]]'' series is a young [[Shugendō|shugenja]] who performs kokkuri in its [[Japanese_urban_legend#Kokkuri-san|modern form]]. Based on the ateji writing of the word, her partner spirits are a kitsune and a tanuki, and as a shugenja she fulfills the role of the tengu.
*In the manga series ''[[Gugure! Kokkuri-san]]'', a girl named Kohina Ichimatsu plays the game by herself and summons the fox spirit Kokkuri-san who, upon seeing her unhealthy lifestyle, takes it upon himself to become her guardian and raise her properly.

'''''Leviathan''''' is a 2012 documentary film directed by [[Lucien Castaing-Taylor]] and [[Véréna Paravel]] of the [[Sensory Ethnography Lab]] at [[Harvard University]].  It is an experimental work about the North American fishing industry. The film has been acquired for U.S. distribution by [[The Cinema Guild]].

The filmmakers used GoPro cameras and worked 20-hour shifts during the shooting of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/18/leviathan-fishing-film-moby-dick|title=Leviathan: the film that lays bare the apocalyptic world of fishing|date=2013-11-18|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Peter Howell of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' said the film "plunges us into the sights and sounds of this visceral business", using "[t]iny waterproof cameras that could be clipped or rested upon people, fish or objects…to capture the film’s raw images and natural sounds. Edited together into a non-linear and virtually wordless whole, it creates a briny immersive effect that is almost hallucinatory."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Howell, [https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2013/03/14/leviathan_a_fisheye_view_aboard_a_commercial_trawler_review.html "Leviathan a fish-eye view aboard a commercial trawler: review"], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', March 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that the film "conveys the brutal toll that the enterprise takes on the workers and on the ocean, and it could even be read as an environmental parable in which the sea threatens to exact its revenge on humanity. But none of this is explicit in the film, which avoids exposition and context, unfolds almost entirely in the dark and often verges on hallucinatory abstraction. Where most documentaries prize clarity, this one attests to the power of estrangement."&lt;ref&gt;[[A. O. Scott]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/movies/harvard-filmmakers-messy-world.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "The Merger of Academia and Art House: Harvard Filmmakers’ Messy World"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Melissa Anderson of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' opined that "[t]he density of aural and visual stimuli overwhelms—and liberates."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Anderson, [http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-02-27/film/steel-yourself-for-leviathan-a-watery-knockout/ "Steel Yourself for Leviathan, A Watery Knockout"], ''[[The Village Voice]]'', February 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[National Public Radio|NPR]] critic [[Stephanie Zacharek]] was less complimentary, calling the film "a self-conscious tone poem concocted from oblique camera angles, shots held longer than it takes a tadpole to reach maturity and nighttime images enhanced with a psychedelic glow. An alternate title for it might be David Lynch, Gone Fishin'."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Zacharek, [https://www.npr.org/2013/02/28/172981501/leviathan-of-fish-and-men-without-chats?ft=1&amp;f=1045 "'Leviathan': Of Fish And Men, Without Chats"], [[National Public Radio]], February 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film won the Michael Powell award for best British feature at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/28/edinburgh-film-festival-awards-leviathan|title=Edinburgh gives top award to experimental documentary Leviathan|date=2013-06-28|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Experimental/Independent Film/Video Award at the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards 2012|2012]] [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/amour-named-best-film-by-399661|title='Amour' Named Best Film by Los Angeles Film Critics|date=2012-12-09|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented within [[Maryland Film Festival]] 2013 as a favorite film of Baltimore-based filmmaker [[Matthew Porterfield]].

{{nihongo|'''''Lunar: Sanposuru Gakuen'''''|Lunar さんぽする学園||lit. "Lunar: Walking School"}} is a [[role-playing video game]] in the [[Lunar series]] released for the [[Sega]] [[Game Gear]] in Japan in 1996. Since then, no international versions or translations have officially been released, though an unofficial English translation was released in 2009.[http://agtp.romhack.net/project.php?id=lunar]  It was developed and produced by the Japanese software company [[Game Arts]] and [[Studio Alex]], their in-house development team responsible for other Lunar titles.

Even though the game was released after ''[[Lunar: The Silver Star]]'', it is set hundreds of years before it.  Several creatures and places from the game also make an appearance.  The game was remade two years later for the [[Sega Saturn]] as '''''Mahō Gakuen Lunar!'''''.

==Gameplay==
The game has several elements common to [[role-playing video game]]s, with 2D character sprites and environments. During the game, the player will encounter monsters that are fought randomly within dungeons, and gain experience from winning battles.  Magic and additional skills are unlocked through leveling up, as well as allowing the characters to grow stronger.  The battles take place from a [[first person (video games)|first-person]] perspective, with menus appearing along the left edge of the screen.

The character menu can be accessed at any time and allow the use of items, magic, or other gameplay settings.  A player's progress is saved on one of three possible slots using the Game Gear's battery back-up.

==Plot==
Walking School tells the tale of a young girl named Ellie and her best friend, Lena, as they leave their quiet lives as field workers in the town of Burg to enroll in a newly established [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] school located on an island called Ien.  There, along with several other youths, the girls find the school and the area around it completely deserted, and try to establish order by getting all the students together within the surrounding town.  During their stay, they encounter several magical creatures and monsters who also call the island home, all while they continue to search for their instructors.

The game itself is divided into 12 chapters, each one presented with a curtain closing and opening.

===Characters===
Playable characters:
*Ellie: The main character of the story who grew up in a small town working on her father's [[farm]].  She is selected along with her best friend Lena to attend the floating magic school.  Somewhat quiet and reserved, she is very loyal to her friends and has a naturally curious personality.
*Lena: Ellie's best friend since childhood.  Unlike Ellie, she is very talkative and often sticks up for herself when bullied about her height.  She likes to wear fancy clothing and is quite self-confident.
*Senia: A young Beastwoman who attends the magic school with Ellie and Lena.  Though she is very strong and athletic, she can command some powerful magic as well.  Almost as vocal as Lena, and the two of them became fast friends.
*Wing: A mysterious and quiet boy who is a later addition to the school's roster.  Naturally gifted at using magic, Wing makes a name for himself early, and is actually enrolled on a [[scholarship]].

Other characters:
*Ant Kule and Rick: Three boys accepted into the magic school who make it their business to tease and otherwise make life difficult for Ellie and Lena.  Eventually, they warm up to each other, but only after a lengthy exchange of insults.
*Barua: Second-in-command of the Vile Tribe who has an interest in Wing.  Commands a wide assortment of dark magic.
*Memphis: Power-hungry leader of the Vile Tribe who worships an entity known as "D".

==Remake==
[[File:Magic School Lunar! Screen01.jpg|thumb|right|A battle in ''Mahō Gakuen Lunar!'']]
{{Nihongo|''Mahō Gakuen Lunar!''|魔法学園ルナ！|lit. "Magic School Lunar!"}} is an [[enhanced remake]] of ''Sanposuru Gakuen'' with updated graphics, newly added [[anime]] cutscenes, and a more complex story. It was developed by [[Studio Alex]] in association with Game Arts and published by [[Entertainment Software Publishing|ESP Software]] and [[Kadokawa Shoten]] for the [[Sega Saturn]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url=http://mediaarts-db.jp/gm/syosai.php?id=392109200856&amp;kbn=c12
| title=魔法学園ルナ
|trans-title=Mahou Gakuen Lunar
| publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] | work=Media Arts Database 
| accessdate=August 11, 2015
| location=Japan | language=Japanese}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Magic School Lunar!'' was released about the same time as other ''Lunar'' remakes, ''[[Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete]]'' and ''[[Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete]]'', and though it  was mildly successful it was never made available outside Japan.

Several enhancements were made to the game that take advantage of the capabilities of modern hardware. While the first game was limited to the hardware restrictions of the 
[[Game Gear]], the new Saturn version boasted a larger color palette, more sophisticated music and sound effects, and the ability to handle full-motion animated sequences placed sporadically throughout the story. The use of a Saturn [[Memory Card]] could also ensure more save slots. The first-person perspective battle interface of the Game Gear version is replaced by a simplified version of the signature Lunar battle system. Character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s are visible on the battlefield and animations for spells and attacks have been considerably upgraded. A number of multi-character combination attacks have been added as well.

==Early life==
Hirannaiah was born in [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], Karnataka on 15 February 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Master Hirannaiah |url= http://www.nettv4u.com/celebrity/kannada/writer/master-hirannaiah |publisher= ''nettv4u'' |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164324/http://www.nettv4u.com/celebrity/kannada/writer/master-hirannaiah |archivedate= 1 March 2018 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father K. Hirannaiah too was an Indian film actor, director, and writer in the [[Kannada film industry]] and a [[Theatre of India|theatre]] artist in the [[Karnataka|state]]. His mother was Sharadamma. After finishing [[Education in India|primary education]] in Banumayya Middle school, Hirannaiah completed [[Secondary school|intermediate]] in Sharada Vilas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sharada Vilas College, Mysore |url= http://www.saradavilas.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=6 |publisher= ''saradavilas.com'' |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180301225024/http://www.saradavilas.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=6 |archivedate= 1 March 2018 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mysore, Karnataka.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13682">A '''motion comic''' (or '''animated comic''') is a form of [[animation]] combining elements of print [[comic book]]s and [[animation]]. Individual panels are expanded into a full shot while sound effects, voice acting, and animation are added to the original artwork. Text boxes and sound effect bubbles are typically removed to feature more of the original artwork being animated. Motion comics are often released as short serials covering a story arc of a long running series or animating a single release of a graphic novel. Single release issues of a story arc are converted into ten- to twenty-minute-long episodes depending on content.

==History==
The earliest examples of motion comics are found in independent creations such as ''[[Broken Saints]]'' (2001). However, the concept was fully outlined in the mid-1960s by science fiction author [[Philip K. Dick]] in his novel ''The Zap Gun'', an expansion of his [[novella]] ''[[Project Plowshare]]'', which was written in 1964 and first published as a [[Serial (literature)|serial]] in the November 1965 and January 1966 issues of ''Worlds Of Tomorrow'' magazine. In Dick's novel, weapon designers of the future are [[mediumship|mediums]], who create their new designs in trance states. The weapon designs are extracted telepathically from a motion comic book, ''The Blue Cephalopod Man from Titan'', created by mad Italian artist Oral Giacomini. Dick describes both the storyline and the animated panels of this comic book in detail. 
[[File:SelinaMedium.gif|thumb|Animation similar to that presented in the series [[The Marvel Super Heroes]].]]
 
In the mid 1960's, [[Marvel_Comics|Marvel Comics Animation]] used the technique for the television show ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]''. Actual artwork from the originally published comic books was augmented by voices, music, and a small amount of animation. The term "Motion comic" did not exist yet.

In 1982, the comic strip [[Jane_(comic_strip)|Jane]] was made [[Jane (TV series)|into a TV series]] by [[BBC]]. It featured brief sequences of a stylized approach to comic panels, partly done with animation, partly with actors in a drawn environment via [[chroma key]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-medium-is-not-enough.com/2011/02/lost_gems_jane_1982-1984.php|title=Lost Gems: Jane (1982-1984) - The Medium is Not Enough|author=|date=18 February 2011|website=the-medium-is-not-enough.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Lions Gate released an animated version of the ''Saw: Rebirth'' comic, one of the first examples of an animated comic created to tie into a film franchise. The first major motion comics released, which is also the first use of the term "motion comic,"  were released by [[Warner Bros.]], the owner of [[DC Comics]] to coincide with the film premieres of ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' and ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'', releasing an adaptation of ''[[Mad Love (comics)|Batman: Mad Love]]'' and ''[[Watchmen: Motion Comics]]'', adapting the [[Watchmen|comic book of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.watchmenmotioncomic.com/ | title=Watchmen Motion Comic | work=Watchmenmotioncomic.com | accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Howell|url=https://www.thestar.com/Entertainment/article/595402|title=Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=March 3, 2009|accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121634908179464605 |last=McBride|first=Sarah|title=Web Draws on Comics|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=July 18, 2008|accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a motion comic called ''Inception: The Cobol Job'' was released as prequel and prologue to the movie [[Inception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/6277-inception-multichannel-marketing-that-works-like-a-dream|title=Inception: multichannel marketing that works like a dream|author=|date=|website=econsultancy.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik0mpATaV9k|title=YouTube|author=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 a prequel motion comic of the movie [[Dredd]] was made to show the origins of the movie's main antagonist, Ma-Ma.

[[Marvel Comics]] has released motion comics using a company owned by [[Neal Adams]]. The first release was an adaptation of [[Joss Whedon]] and [[John Cassaday]]'s ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'': "Gifted". Other adaptations include ''[[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'': "Agent of S.W.O.R.D.", ''[[Iron Man]]'': "[[Extremis (comics)|Extremis]]", [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], ''Thor/Loki: Blood Brothers'', ''Inhumans'' and ''Astonishing X-Men'': "Dangerous".

Examples from other companies include ''[[Peanuts Motion Comics]]'', ''Zits'' Motion Comics, the ''[[Dead Space (comics)|Dead Space]]'' prequel comics and the "Lucy" element of the ABC News documentary ''[[Earth 2100]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Marshall |first=Rick |url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2009/06/02/comic-creators-play-big-role-in-tonights-earth-2100-special/ |title=Comic Creators Play Big Role In Tonight’s ‘Earth 2100’ Special.| work=MTV | date=June 2, 2009 | accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another example would be a four-part motion comic based on the ''[[Uncharted]]'' video game series as a prequel called ''Eye of Indra'', released for the [[PlayStation Network]]. 

=== Illustrated films ===
A sibling format to ''motion comics'' called ''[[HALO 8 Entertainment#Illustrated films|illustrated films]]'' was developed by [[transmedia]] studio [[HALO 8 Entertainment]] with their ''[[Godkiller (series)|Godkiller]]'', which was produced at the same time as (but separately from) the ''Watchmen'' motion comic. As opposed to repurposing an existing comic book, Halo-8 created new sequential art that was designed from its inception to be transmedia art for both a comic book and an illustrated film. ''Godkiller'' creator [[Matt Pizzolo]] told [[Bloody Disgusting]] "''Godkiller'' was just a slower production than ''Watchmen'' because we had to create 200 pages of art and story from the ground up first, rather than starting with one of the greatest comic books ever made as source material. Plus we had a dozen voice performers instead of just one."&lt;ref&gt;THEoDEAD. "[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/comics/589 MAY SPOTLIGHT: Halo-8 PLUS An Interview With Founder Matt Pizzolo!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507220720/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/comics/589 |date=2010-05-07 }}". Bloody Disgusting.'' May 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although aesthetically similar to motion comics, Pizzolo identifies ''illustrated film'' influences as including ''[[Liquid Television]]'', the [[MTV]] cartoon adaptation of ''[[The Maxx]]'', the ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]'' anime series, [[Chris Marker]]'s ''[[La jetée]]'', the motion comic ''[[Broken Saints]]'', and the experimental cinema of [[Ralph Bakshi]].&lt;ref&gt;Anders, Jason.

According to [[Comics Alliance]], Pizzolo stated "the difference between an illustrated film and a motion comic is kind of the difference between a movie that was shot in 3D versus a movie that was shot in 2D but got a 3D post-conversion. We're not repurposing an existing comic book here, we're building something unique from scratch."&lt;ref&gt;Khouri, Andy.

==Reception==
Reception to motion comics has been mixed. 

[[NewTeeVee]] commented, "This first generation [of motion comics] is admittedly crude, but there is enough 'motion' in these motion comics to keep the viewer’s attention, and so far the music and voice acting have been great. Plus, the level of experimentation and sophistication will grow as more are produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newteevee.com/2008/07/30/the-rise-of-motion-comics-online/ | last=Albrecht | first=Chris | title=The Rise of Motion Comics Online | publisher = NewTeeVee.com | date=July 30, 2008 | accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ComicsWorthReading.com asked,
{{quote|When you add camera tricks and a soundtrack to a comic, is it still a comic? Or just a poor excuse for a cartoon, done on the cheap? Are they reaching a new audience, attracted by a new format in more modern sales outlets (that come to them)? Will those hypothetical new readers eventually wind up buying traditional-format comics? Could this be just another way to try and make more money from the same, previously existing content?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Draper Carlson | first1=Johanna |first2=K.C. | last2=Carlson | url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2009/08/23/whats-the-point-of-a-motion-comic/ | title=What's the Point of a Motion Comic | publisher = ComicsWorthReading.com | accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Artist [[John Cassaday]] described his experience with the motion comic adaptation of ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'', saying:
{{quote|I'd seen some motion comic animation, and the quality varied. When Marvel approached me, I was initially hesitant, but after looking at some test footage and hearing how committed they were, I knew what direction they were wanting to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=23421 | title=Cassaday on the "Astonishing X-Men" Motion Comic | publisher= [[ComicBookResources.com]] | first=Dave | last=Richards | date=October 23, 2009 | accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Comparison to visual novels==
The [[visual novel]], a form of [[interactive fiction]] largely created in [[Japan]] (and also constituting the majority of [[PC game]]s sold in the country), makes similar usage of animated transitions between still graphic images for narrative purposes. Visual novels, which have been released since the 1980s, also make use of background music and voice talents in order to help drive the narrative. 

However, unlike most Western motion comics: 
* Visual novels only occasionally make use of motion in-scene (i.e., a body part moving inside an otherwise-static scene).
* Visual novels, while making use of voice talents, also provide dialogue through dialogue boxes - usually superimposed on the bottom of the screen.
* Visual novel characters are usually depicted through graphic [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] superimposed upon a generic background; more detailed character designs and backgrounds are typically reserved for key scenes and events in the narrative.
* The majority of visual novels are original properties and are adapted for, rather than adaptations of, manga or anime.
* Visual novels can either be little more than [[interactive film]]s or much more interactive [[adventure game]]s, with the dialog boxes containing controls for interaction with the game.
* Visual novels are also typically written from the [[first-person narrative]].
* Most visual novels have [[Dialogue tree|dialogue choices]], [[Nonlinear gameplay|branching storylines]], and [[multiple endings]].
==List of Motion Comics Projects==

*''[[Watchmen: Motion Comic]]'' (2008)
*''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' (2009)
*''[[Batgirl: Year One]]'' (2009)
*''[[Superman:_Red_Son#Miscelleanous|Superman: Red Son]]'' (2009)

It covers topics related to culture, design, events, oddities and tourism in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronorp.net/zurich_en/ron-orps-mail/archive/newsletter/b95302860c594dd777456af6a51dce10|title=Web tip: New in town| work=Ron Orp|date=5 February 2015|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://swisscgny.tumblr.com/page/26|title=Swiss Event In NYC Jul 8-23| work=Swiss GNY|date=8 July 2014|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Newly Swissed'' was launched in 2010 by Dimitri Burkhard, a digital marketing expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helloswitzerland.ch/-/from-buckeyes-to-newly-swissed| title=From Buckeyes To Newly Swissed|work=Hello Switzerland|date=27 October 2015|accessdate=18 December 2016|author=Ashley Roque}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globesession.com/edition07/artikel/top-10-beste-schweizer-reiseblogs/|title=Top10 – Beste Schweizer Reiseblogs|work=globesession|accessdate=18 December 2016|author=Martin Hoch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine incorporated as Newly Swissed GmbH in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moneyhouse.ch/de/company/newly-swissed-gmbh-6760123481|title=Newly Swissed GmbH|work=Moneyhouse|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.themenpuls.ch/2015/02/04/blogcharts-januar-expats-bewegen-die-schweiz/|title=Blogcharts November: Der Datenblog des Tages-Anzeigers ist der Aufsteiger|work=Blog von Themenpuls|date=4 February 2015| accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was the only online magazine about Switzerland written in English. ''Newly Swissed'' is frequently quoted by major publications on the subject of expat life in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2015/05/06/why-switzerland-so-often-tops-quality-of-life-surveys/ |title=Why Switzerland So Often Tops Quality-of-Life Surveys|author=Chantal Panozzo|date=6 May 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annabelle.ch/leben/gesellschaft/allein-unter-fremden-expats-schweiz-43990|title=Allein unter Fremden: Expats in der Schweiz|last=Dinah Leuenberger|work=Annabelle|access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early stages, observations about Swiss lifestyle and culture served as the main sources of content. Now, the magazine covers a range of topics in depth, from architecture to oddities, and from tourism to advice on in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dicconbewes.com/2012/07/20/have-you-been-newly-swissed-yet/|title=Have you been Newly Swissed yet?|work=Diccon Bewes|date=July 2012|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication is primarily concerned with serving the international community in Switzerland, as well as the Swiss population living abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zurich1200fountains.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/zurich-1200-fountains-in-newly-swissed/| title=Zurich 1200 Fountains in Newly Swissed|work=Zurich1200Funtains|date=22 April 2015|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the magazine’s success has historically been built on its journalistic coverage of Switzerland from the perspective of multiple writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newlyswissed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Blick-am-Abend_031214_page252.pdf|title=Follow me |work=Blick am Abend}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newlyswissed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/regio-Newly-Swissed-Feb-5-2015_singlepage.pdf |title=Ein Blog für Zugezogene |publisher=züriost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Noesa Penida''''' ({{IPA-id|nuˈsa pəˈnida|}}; [[EYD|Perfected Spelling]] '''''Nusa Penida''''') is a 1941 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (present-day Indonesia) which was directed by [[Andjar Asmara]] and produced by [[The Teng Chun]] of Java Industrial FIlm. It tells of a love triangle between two brothers, born to a commoner, and a noble woman.

==Plot==
On the island of [[Nusa Penida]], two common-born brothers (Jaya and I Pageh) are friends with Pandansari, daughter of the king. When the king is murdered, Pandansari goes into hiding with her father's loyal manservant I Murda. Jaya, I Pageh, and Pandansari are soon entangled in a [[love triangle]], one which is rendered more difficult owing to differences in [[Balinese caste system|caste]]. Ultimately, after rumors emerge that Jaya has been killed, Pandansari chooses I Pageh.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Noesa Penida}}

==Production==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">'''[[Performing arts]] presenting organizations''' facilitate exchanges between artists and audiences through creative, educational, and performance opportunities. The work that these artists perform is produced outside of the presenting organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urban.org/url.cfm?ID=410604 "The Capacity of Performing Arts Presenting Organizations,"] by Mark A. Hager and Thomas H. Pollak, The [[Urban Institute]], Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy, April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performing arts presenters are typically found in three varieties:
*Those attached to a college, university, or other educational institution, with performances usually taking place on campus;
*Those that are an administrative branch of a theater or concert hall, usually presenting performances only in that space;
*Those that are independently administered outside any specific venue, usually renting multiple venues for performances.


The [[Association of Performing Arts Presenters]], located in Washington, D.C., is the largest organizing body of performing arts presenters in the United States. The primary international organizing body of performing arts presenters is the International Society for the Performing Arts.[http://www.ispa.org/]

==Performing arts presenters in the United States==
* [[Celebrity Series of Boston]] ([[Boston, Massachusetts]])
* [[Rockport Music]] ([[Rockport, Massachusetts]])
* [[University Musical Society]] ([[Ann Arbor, Michigan]])
* [[Whitefish Theatre Company]] ([[Whitefish, Montana]])
* [[Hopkins Center for the Arts]] ([[Dartmouth College]], [[Hanover, New Hampshire]])

'''Polaqia''' (frequently misspelled Polaquia) is a group of comic-book creators born in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (a state in the northwest of [[Spain]]) who self-publish their own projects besides working for external publishers. Currently it's a legally constituted cultural association.

==History==
Founded in June 2001 by writer Kike Benlloch and artists Bernal, Jano, David Rubín and Alberto Vázquez, its editorial debut took place in August of the same year with the 48 page anthology "Mmmh!!", a collection of speechless B/W short stories. In 2002, two individual [[comic-books]] were published, the intimist "Patricia" by Jano and the ironic "Alter ego" by Alberto Vázquez. Both artists left Polaqia soon. In 2003 Polaqia launched its twice-a-year anthology "Barsowia". "Barsowia" has reached issue number fourteen by August 2009. Only two founding members are still in the organisation, Bernal and David Rubín, after Kike Benlloch's departure in 2009.

Other artists featured under the seal are Emma Ríos with her 4 issue [sci-fi] miniseries "A prueba de balas" and Álvaro López with three one-shots ("Feliz cumpleaños, May", "A voz na caixa" and "38", the latter co-created with Luís Sendón). Self-published books from Polaqia also include "Corazón de tormentas" by David Rubín and "Tanque Familiar" by Diego Blanco.

==Awards==
Barsowia won in June 2006 the Readers' Award for Best Fanzine in [[Spain]], 2005, at the Barcelona Convention, Spain's main comic-related event. At the same festival Barsowia won in April 2007 the Official Award for Best Fanzine in [[Spain]], 2006. This award is voted by professionals and critics alike and the highest honor a fanzine can achieve in Spain. The third award to the group was given by the Youth House of Ourense: The Premio Ourense de BD is the main regional award, it acknowledges annually the best comic-related work in Galicia.

==Current lines of work==
Besides the ongoing Barsowia and self-conclusive comic-books, Polaqia publishes a series of mini art-books ("Polaqia Sketchbook", #1 by Miguel Robledo) and a collection of graphic novels in Spanish ("Rompehielos", the first title is 76-page "Pinche Mundo" by Kike Benlloch and Diego Blanco).

==Languages==
Polaqia has published books both in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Galician language]], as well as short stories in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

==Members==
As of December 2009 the current Polaqia members (11) are Hugo Covelo, Roque Romero, Brais Rodríguez, Diego Blanco, David Rubín, Sergio Covelo, Bernal Prieto, Álvaro López, Emma Ríos, Luís Sendón, Jose Domingo. Meanwhile, the anthology "Barsowia" has had uncountable contributors including Michael Bonfiglio (USA), Bouss (France), Louis Bertrand Devaud (France), Ken Niimura (Spain), Esteban Hernández (Spain), Susa Monteiro (Portugal), Paulo Monteiro (Portugal).

==Coordinators==
Kike Benlloch 2001-2006
&lt;br&gt;Hugo Covelo 2006-2008
&lt;br&gt;David Rubín 2008-2009

'''Red Shirt''' (Oglala Lakota: ''Ógle Šá'' in Standard Lakota Orthography) (a/k/a "Ogilasa" and "Joseph Red Shirt") (1847-January 4, 1925) was an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]] [[Lakota People|Lakota]] chief, warrior and statesman. Red Shirt is notable in American history as a U.S. Army Native Scout and a progressive Oglala Lakota leader who promoted friendly associations with whites and education for his people. Red Shirt opposed Crazy Horse during the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877 and the Ghost Dance Movement of 1890, and was a Lakota delegate to Washington in 1880. Red Shirt was one of the first Wild Westers with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and a supporter of the Carlisle Native Industrial School. Red Shirt became an international celebrity Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and his 1887 appearance in England captured the attention of Europeans and presented a progressive image of Native Americans.

[[File:Russellwarcouncil.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|Intertribal warfare]]
[[File:Red Dog in Carlisle.png|200px|thumbnail|right|Chief Red Dog and daughters, Carlisle, PA.]]
Red Shirt was born near [[Fort Fetterman]], [[Wyoming]]. There are several accounts of Red Shirt's early life. One account is that Red Shirt is the son of a white man and a Lakota mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amertribes.proboards.com/thread/1854/chief-red-shirt#ixzz2ZsPXbiJy|title=Chief Red Shirt - www.American-Tribes.com|website=amertribes.proboards.com|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another account, by Red Shirt, is that he was the son of a great warrior chief.&lt;ref&gt;In an interview, Red Shirt said his father was a great chief, and that he was eager to prove himself a great warrior in his eyes.  The ''Brisbane Courier'', “The Sioux Chief Red Shirt Interviewed”, June 23, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Will Rogers]] reported that Red Shirt was the son of Red Dog, a progressive headman of the Oyuhpe band who settled at [[Pine Ridge, South Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Frank Wertheim and Barbara Bair, ed., ''The Papers of Will Rogers: Wild West and Vaudeville, April 1904-September 1908'', (2000), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Red Shirt and Red Dog were Lakota delegates to Washington in 1880, served as Pine Ridge Indian Police and sent their children to the [[Carlisle Native Industrial School]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]]. Historians agree that by 1877 Red Shirt had emerged as a leader of the [[Wagluhe]] at Pine Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Seavey Ricker and Richard E. Jensen, “Voices of the American West: The Indian interviews of Eli S. Ricker, 1903-1919, Volume 1, p.15 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Four Wagluhe Leaders.png|400px|thumbnail|right|Wagluhe leaders after the Battle of the Little Big Horn: Left to right: Blue Horse, American Horse, Three Bears and Red Shirt.]]

Red Shirt was a [[U.S. Army Native Scouts|U.S. Army Native Scout]] with [[U.S. 4th Cavalry Regiment]] during the [[Great Sioux War of 1876-77]]&lt;ref name=Bourke&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bourke |first=John |title=Mackenzie's Last Fight with the Cheyennes |publisher=Argonaut Press Ltd. |year=1966 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emerged as a "up and coming" [[Wagluhe]] leader.&lt;ref&gt;The Wagluhe were considered by the U.S. Army and Indian agents to be the most progressive band of Lakota and many became U.S. Army Indian Scouts with the U.S. 4th Cavalry Regiment and intermediaries with other bands of Lakotas. The Wagluhe first formed a civil administration at Ft. Laramie and Old Chief Smoke appointed Chief Blue Horse and Chief Big Mouth the first Native Police officers.  The U.S. Army concluded that, even if there were doubts about their reliability, the Wagluhe’s role as scouts, civil administrators and mediators was absolutely essential. The Wagluhe were the first Oglala Lakota to send their children to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, for a formal education, and the first to go Wild Westing with Col. "Buffalo Bill" Cody and his Wild West. Former U.S. Army Native Scouts and traditional Lakota law enforcers (akicitas) filled the ranks of the early Pine Ridge police force. In 1876 and 1877, more than five hundred Lakotas had served as army scouts in the Nez Perce campaign and in the pursuit of their tribesmen after the Battle of the Little Bighorn.  Mark R. Ellis, “Reservation Akicitas: The Pine Ridge Indian Police, 1879-1885" (hereinafter "Ellis"), South Dakota History, Vol. 29, No. 3, (1999), p. 187-190.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, the Wagluhe split into three bands, those of [[American Horse]], [[Chief Blue Horse|Blue Horse]] and Three Bears. Red Shirt served as Three Bears’ lieutenant, and officially became a chief in 1879 at Pine Ridge Agency. In 1879, Red Shirt also became a chief of the Pine Ridge Police, and continued in that capacity at least through 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Red Shirt and Red Dog were listed on the police roster as members of the Oyuhpe Band. Ellis, p. 200. “Chief Red Shirt Quits Footlights”, ''New Castle News'', July 12, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1880, Red Shirt traveled to the [[Carlisle Native School]] with Red Cloud and Red Dog and on to Washington D.C. as a Lakota delegate.&lt;ref&gt;Herman J.

== Warrior ==
Although many consider him not a part of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] that is still up for debate.{{According to whom|date=September 2016}} Most of Red Shirt's history has been written down. Living family members of his tell of his bravery in battle. Buffalo Bill Cody was impressed with Red Shirt. “Among the prominent chiefs thus engaged was Red Shirt, a redoubtable warrior and second only in influence to [[Sitting Bull]] himself. A short while before his engagement with us he had quelled an uprising among his people, instigated by a pretender to the chieftainship of the tribe, by invading the pretender's camp with only two of his followers and shooting the leader dead before the eyes of his affrighted wife. This fearless act had served to elevate him very much in the eyes of his people, who thereafter accepted him as a leader. When, therefore, he decided to join the Wild West show, under the flattering offers I made him, his influence aided us very much in procuring our complement of Indians, not only from his own tribe, but from others as well.”&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Bill and William Lightfoot Visscher, ''The Life and Adventures of Buffalo Bill'' , (hereinafter "Buffalo Bill"), (1917), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Red Shirt, along with Blue Horse and American Horse, enrolled their children in the first class at [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]]. They wanted their children to learn English, trade skills and white customs. "Those first Sioux children who came to Carlisle could not have been happy there. But it was their only chance for a future." &lt;ref&gt;Ann Rinaldi, “My Heart is on the Ground: the Diary of Nannie Little Rose, a Sioux Girl, Carlisle Native School, Pennsylvania, 1880,” (1999), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wild Westing]] and the Carlisle Indian School were portals to education, opportunity and hope, and came at a time when the Lakota people were depressed, impoverished, harassed and confined.  Many Wild Westers from Pine Ridge enrolled their children at the Carlisle Native Industrial School from its beginning in 1879 until its closure in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Alida S. Boorn, “Oskate Wicasa (One Who Performs)” (hereinafter “Oskate Wicasa”), Department of History, Central Missouri State University, (2005), p.131.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wild Westing ==
[[File:Buffalo Bill and Wild Westers at Sea.png|300px|thumbnail|right| On March 31, 1887, [[Chief Blue Horse]], [[American Horse|Chief American Horse]] and Chief Red Shirt and their families boarded the ''S.S. State of Nebraska'' in New York City, and began a new journey for the Lakota people when they crossed the sea to England with Buffalo Bill to perform at the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria]].]]

On March 31, 1887, Chief Red Shirt,  [[Chief Blue Horse]] and Chief [[American Horse]] and their families boarded the ''S.S. State of Nebraska'' in New York City, leading a new journey for the Lakota people when they crossed the sea to England on Buffalo Bill’s first international to perform at the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria]] and tour through Birmingham, Salford and London over a five–month period. The entourage consisted of 97 Indians, 18 buffaloes, 2 deer, 10 elk, 10 mules, 5 Texas steers, 4 donkeys, and 108 horses. Buffalo Bill treated Native American employees as equals with white cowboys. [[Wild Westers]] received good wages, transportation, housing, abundant food and gifts of clothing and cash from Buffalo Bill at the end of each season.  Wild Westers were employed as performers, interpreters and recruiters.  Men had money in their pockets and for their families on the reservation. Female performers were paid extra for infants and children and supplemented wages by making and selling Lakota crafts.&lt;ref&gt;Calls the Name and other women supplemented wages by making and selling Lakota crafts. Women served important community roles in camps backstage. Augmenting their show wages was common among Show Indians, especially "'bead work' made into moccasins, purses, etc.," which earned them "very large prices," according to Nate Salsbury. Cody and Salsbury often purchased goods at wholesale prices and sold the goods to Indians at cost, allowing them to create souvenirs for tourists. Show Indians created and sold goods to museums, collectors, and customers across Europe and the United States. Jason Heppler, “Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Natives”, {{cite web |url=http://segonku.unl.edu/~jheppler/showindian/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419101910/http://segonku.unl.edu/~jheppler/showindian/ |archivedate=2011-04-19 |df= }}.  Performers’ newborn babies became part of the villages set up outside show areas. Oskate Wicasa, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt; Shows hired venerable elder male Natives to appear in the parades to ensure that young men acted with consideration and politeness when visiting host communities, and rules were self-policed by traditional Oglala Lakota chiefs and former U.S. Army Native Scouts.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.6, 54. The number of police chosen depended on the number of Natives traveling with the show each season, a usual ration being one policeman for every dozen Natives. Native policemen selected from the ranks of the performers were given badges and paid $10 more in wages per month. in 1898, Chief Iron Tail managed the Native Police. Michele Delaney, [http://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Details/Buffalo-Bill%E2%80%99s-Wild-West-Warriors-Photographs-by-Gertrude-K%C3%A4sebier-4679 “Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude Kasebier, Smithsonian National Museum of American History”],  (2007), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Known as “Show Natives”, Oglala Wild Westers referred to themselves as "''Oskate Wicasa''" or "Show Man", a title of great honor and respect.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa is a colloquialism meaning “one who performs.” Its usage began in the early days of the Buffalo Bill Cody Wild West Shows. Oskate Wicasa, p.1. The phrase "Show Natives" likely originated among newspaper reporters and editorial writers as early as 1891.  By 1893 the term appears frequently in Bureau of Native Affairs correspondence. Some believe that the term is derogatory describing the "phenomenon of Native exploitation and romanticization in the U.S."  Arguments of a similar nature were made by the Bureau of Native Affairs during the popularity of Wild West shows in the U.S. and Europe.  L.G. Moses, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1887, Wild Westing has been family tradition with several hundred Pine Ridge families, and the tradition of the Wild Wester community is not unlike the tradition of circus families and communities.&lt;ref&gt;American Horse’s sons Ben American Horse and Samuel American Horse were Carlisle Wild Westers and interpreters. Between 1906 and 1915, 570 individuals from Pine Ridge went Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill and other shows. Oskate Wicasa, p.164. L.G. Moses, “Wild West Shows and the Images of American Natives, 1883-1933,” (1996), p. 33 , 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crossing the sea ==
Before starting on the trip to England in 1887, several of the Indians expressed grave fears that the great waters soon overtake them a bring a horrible death.  Red Shirt explained that these fears were caused by a belief prevalent among many tribes of Natives, that if a red man attempted to cross the ocean, soon after beginning his journey he would be seized of a malady that would first prostrate the victim, and then slowly consume his flesh day after day, until at length the very skin itself would drop from his bones, leaving nothing but the skeleton and this even could never find burial.  On the day following the departure from New York, the Indians began to grow weary and their stomachs became both treacherous and rebellious. Their fears were now so greatly intensified that even Red Shirt, the bravest of his people, began to feel his flesh to see if it were really diminishing.  Buffalo Bill, "used his utmost endeavors to cheer them up and relieve their forebodings. But for two days nearly the whole company was too sick for any other active service than feeding the fishes, in which I am not proud to say that I performed more than an ordinary share. On the third day, however, we all began to mend so far that I called the Natives together in the main saloon and gave them a Sunday address, as did also Red Shirt, who was now recovered from his anxiety about the future.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Bill, p. 318-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Red Shirt in England ==

[[File:Chief Red Shirt by Henry W. Wyman 1904.png|200px|thumbnail|left| Chief Red Shirt was a Wild Wester for over thirty years. Chief Red Shirt, St. Louis World's Fair, 1904.]]
Chief Red Shirt was lionized by the British press and photographed by reporters wherever he went. His handsome features and stately bearing caused reporters to hang on his every word and he became the most quoted Wild Wester celebrity of Cody’s trip to England.&lt;ref&gt;Oskate Wicasa, p.67. By the Columbian Exposition (1893) he was the most famous Wild Wester in the world. p.43-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Red Shirt explained to a reporter from Sheffield: “I started from my lodge two moons ago knowing nothing, and had I remained on the Native Reservations, I should have been as a blind man.  Now I can see a new dawn. I have seen the great houses (ships) which cross the mighty waters, the great villages which have no end where the pale faces swarm like insects in the summer sun. Our people will wonder at these things when we return to the Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.”{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Statesman ===
Red Shirt adopted a show business persona and proved to be a statesman. Red Shirt presented an image of Native Americans that Europeans could associate with progress, nobility, and civilization. Queen Victoria adored Chief Red Shirt and requested a special command performance.&lt;ref&gt;“Could building site be burial ground of the lost warrior from Buffalo Bill's show?, ''Daily Mail'', August 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Red Shirt commented to ''[[The Brisbane Courier]]''  on the future of Natives in the United States. "The red man is changing in every season.  The Native of the next generation will not be the Native of the last.  Our buffaloes are nearly all gone, the deer have entirely vanished, and the white man takes more and more of our land. But the United States government is good. True, it has taken away our land, and the white man have eaten up our deer and our buffalo, but the government now gives us food that we may not starve. They are educating our children and teaching them to use farm implements.  Our children will learn the white man’s civilization and to live like him.  It is our only outlook in the future.  Now we are dependent upon the rations of the Government but we feel we are fully entitled to that bounty.  It is a part of the price they pay for the land they have taken from us, and some compensation to us for having killed off the herds upon which we subsisted.  For myself, I know it is no use fighting against the United States government.  I accept my fate.  The red man cannot kill all the white men that live in villages as big as the largest forests.  But some of our young men do not know this, and they may perhaps elect to die like their fathers with their tomahawks in their hands rather than starve to death like a dog upon the prairie."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Brisbane Courier, “The Sioux Chief Red Shirt Interviewed”, June 23, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visitors to Earl’s Court ===
[[File:William Ewart Gladstone - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[William Ewart Gladstone]]. "When I saw the great White Chief I thought he was a great man.  When I heard him speak, then I felt sure he was a great man." ''Chief Red Shirt'' ]]
The royal party inspected the Indian encampment after a performance and [[Prince Albert Edward]] had an extended conversation with Red Shirt.  [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]], through an interpreter, welcomed Chief Red Shirt and other Wild Westers to England.  The chief, with great dignity, responded: "Tell the Great White Chief 's wife that it gladdens my heart to hear her words." On April 28, 1887, [[William Ewart Gladstone]], former Prime Minister and current leader of the opposition party in Parliament, toured the Wild West show grounds with his wife at [[Earl's Court]] and spoke at length with Red Shirt. Red Shirt was impressed with Gladstone.

“When I saw the great White Chief I thought he was a great man.  When I heard him speak, then I felt sure he was a great man.  But the White Chief is not as the big men in out tribes.  He wore no plumes and no decorations.  He had none of his young men (warriors) with him, and only that I heard him talk he would have been to me as other white men.  But my brother Mr. Gladstone came to see me in my lodge as a friend, and I was glad to see the White Chief, for though my tongue was tied in his presence my heart was in full friendship.  After he went away they told me that half of his great nation of white men have adopted him as their chief.  If he were not both good and wise, so many young men of his nation would have never taken him for their leader.”&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Bill, p. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grandmother England ===
[[File:Buffalo Bill and Indians in Salford, 1887.png|300px|thumb|left|Buffalo Bill and Indians, Salford, England, 1887]]
[[File:Queen Victoria 60. crownjubilee.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Queen Victoria]] adored Chief Red Shirt.]]
On May 9, 1887, Buffalo Bill's Wild West opened in London. Among the audience members was Queen Victoria, who visited the Earl's Court encampment three days later.  [[Black Elk]] recalled that Natives were told "that Majesty was coming. I did not know what that was at first, but I learned afterward. It was Grandmother England who owned Grandmother's Land where we lived awhile after the ''Wasichus'' murdered Crazy Horse."  Red Shirt expressed his pleasure in meeting the Queen and remarked to her that "I have come many thousands of miles to see you. Now that I have seen you, my heart is glad."  The encounter and his words were widely circulated among the press and noted in her diary. Since the death of Prince Albert, her husband, which event had occurred thirty years previous to this "command," the queen had been more than ordinarily seclusive. She seldom appeared before great assemblages of her subjects and her visits to even her parliament were rare. To theatrical performances she never went during that long period of her mourning. Her latest knowledge of the greatest actors and actresses of the time was gained by private performances given, by command, in her court, and these were infrequent.  "The Wild West was altogether too big a thing to take to Windsor Castle, and as in the case of Mahomet and the mountain, as the Wild West could not go to the Queen it became absolutely necessary for the Queen to go to the Wild West, if she desired to see it, and it was evident that she did."&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Bill, p. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt; "Then I presented Red Shirt, the Native Chieftain, who was gorgeous in war paint and feather trappings. His proud bearing was fetching among the royal party, and when he spoke through an interpreter, saying he had come a long way to see her Majesty and "felt glad," the Queen smiled appreciatively, and as the red man, unconventionally, but proudly, strolled away with the dignity of a Supreme Court Judge, she seemed to say, "I know a real prince when I see him."&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Bill, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; "Every act went with a rush and a cheer, and was received by cries of 'bravo,' 'well done,' etc. At the close of the exhibition calls were made for Red Shirt and myself, in response to which I thanked my patrons and assured them that the recollection of that evening's display of kindness would ever be fresh in my memory. Cries of 'Bravo, Bill,' and the singing of 'For he's a jolly good fellow' by the entire audience brought the demonstration to a close."&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Bill, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goethe's ''Faust'' ===
[[File:Goethe's Faust.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|The Sioux, who did not believe in a hell, took the fantastic scenes of Hades in Goethe’s Faust, according to their interpreter, “for what it’s worth,” a ''Wasichu’s'' dream.]] [[File:Red Shirt3.png|200px|thumbnail|right|Red Shirt wearing a President Grant [[Native Peace Medal]] and badge No. 25 identifying him as a Chief in Cummins's "Native Congress of Forty-eight Tribes."

Shortly after arriving in London, Cody took some of his Wild Westers to see Sir [[Henry Irving]]'s production of [[Goethe's Faust]] at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theater]].  ''[[The London Times]]'' reported that the Sioux were greatly frightened by its horror. In the premier theater of London, Red Shirt, considered the "Chief of the Show Natives by the press, was seated in the royal box suggesting an aura of nobility for the cowboys and Natives in attendance. Irving used the occasion to his own advantage, inviting the performers onstage after the show. Irving remarked to the theatrical paper [[The Era (newspaper)|''Era'']] that it was novel to "see Native chiefs in the full panoply of war–paint, holding the scalp–fringed banner in one hand and eating sugar plums with the other." Red Shirt remarked that the show reminded him of a dream. The Sioux, who did not believe in a hell, took the fantastic scenes of Hades, according to their interpreter, “for what it’s worth,” a ''Wasichu’s'' dream.

=== Vision at Westminster Abbey ===
"The white man’s lodges for the Great Spirit, whose pinnacles reach the sky, and which have stood for more seasons than the red man reckon, all struck me with terrible wonder. And the Great Spirit speaks to me sometimes since I have been here.  When I was in the Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands.  The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy.  Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw in a blaze of light the girls with wings and they beckoned me.  And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called out to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for when I looked around the great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams.  Our people will wonder at these things, when we return to the Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== English hospitality ===
[[File:Annie Red Shirt, 1898.png|200px|thumbnail|left|Annie Red Shirt, daughter of Chief Red Shirt, Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, Omaha, Nebraska, 1898.]]
The ''London Courier'' reported Red Shirt and companions were treated to an evening of English hospitality. “[[Willesden]] was as it were taken by storm on Sunday last, being invaded by the Indian contingent of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. The fact was that Mr. T.B. Jones, of the White Hart Hotel had, as another instance of his great geniality, invited Red Shirt, Blue Horse, Little Bull, Little Chief and Flies Above and about twenty others to an outing to his well-known hostelry, whereabout they might enjoy his bounteous hospitality. In carriage and brake, provided by my host, these celebrated chiefs, along with their swarthy companions, with faces painted gaily, bedizened and bedangled with feathers and ornaments, and clad in their picturesque garments, accompanied by their chief interpreter, Broncho Bill and other officials, reached the White Heart about half-past 12 o’clock.”&lt;ref&gt;The Courier (London), September 1, 1887, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surrounded By the Enemy's funeral ===
In 1887, Buffalo Bill and his Wild West camped in the [[City of Salford|City of Salford, England]], for five months. While in Salford, a Wild West gun-slinging and horse-riding stuntman known as Surrounded By the Enemy died from a chest infection, probably caused by the chilly weather, in his teepee at the Salford Quays.  "Surrounded" was described as six feet seven inches tall, aged 22 and an imposing sight of a Sioux warrior. There was no recorded church burial, and it is believed that Surrounded was buried in a traditional Sioux ceremony conducted by Red Shirt and Black Elk. The Oglala Lakota connection lives on in Salford with street names such as Buffalo Court and Dakota Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.canadiancontent.net/history/66250-could-british-burial-ground-sioux.html|title=Could the British burial ground of Sioux warrior have been found?|website=forums.canadiancontent.net|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eiffel Tower ===
[[File:Descendants of old Chief Red Shirt and Chief Two Bulls - NARA - 285585.jpg|300px|thumb|right| Descendants of Chief Red Shirt and Chief Two Bulls, c. 1930]]
In 1889, Cody's Wild West spent six months in Paris.  On the centennial of the fall of the Bastille, a group of Wild Westers ascended the Eiffel Tower.  From the observation plat, Red Shirt surveying Paris below him and the sky above, remarked "If people look so little to us up here, how much smaller they must seem to One ''"Wakantanka"'' who is up higher."&lt;ref&gt;Moses, p. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final days ==
Wild Westing was Chief Red Shirt's main economic support for the next several decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franksrealm.com/Native_American/tribes/Sioux_Lakota/Oglala/pages/oglala-redshirt.htm ]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Red Shirt died in 1925 at the age of 77 and is buried at [[Pine Ridge, South Dakota]].

[[File:Buffalo Gap National Grassland.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Buffalo Gap National Grassland]]
Red Shirt Table is a [[Table (landform)|table mountain]] in [[Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota|Oglala Lakota County]], [[South Dakota]], and part of the [[Pine Ridge Native Reservation]] of the [[Oglala Sioux Tribe]]. The table, named after Chief Red Shirt is approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} long, generally extending in a north-south direction, and is located along the western boundary of [[Badlands National Park]]'s Stronghold Unit. The park's highest point is located at the southern end of the table at {{convert|3340|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =U.S. National Park High Points | work = | publisher =Peakbagger.com | date = | url =http://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=1821 | accessdate =2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The irregularly shaped southern portion of the table is connected to the more rectangular northern portion by a narrow section less than {{convert|800|ft|m}} wide; the northern portion is up to two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) wide and is composed of two elongated lobes with a [[erosion|runoff channel]] between them. The top surface of the table slopes gently downhill as it extends northward, with the north edge being at about 2,800' in elevation. It drops off steeply from almost all sides, up to 300'. [[French Creek (Cheyenne River)|French Creek]] flows to the northeast, and the [[intermittent]] Cedar Creek drains the entire east side of the table.

Red Shirt Table is one of many tables in the White River Badlands. Others include Cuny Table, Sheep Mountain Table, and Heck Table.

The Oglala [[Lakota people|Lakota]] community of [[Red Shirt, South Dakota|Red Shirt]] is located below the north end of the table in the [[Cheyenne River]] valley in the  [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]].

== Red Shirt Wilderness Area ==
[[Buffalo Gap National Grassland]] located primarily in southwestern [[South Dakota]], [[United States]], is the second largest National Grassland in the country and covers almost 600,000 acres.  The area is mixed prairie and chalky badlands and managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Within this grassland, the Cheyenne River watershed contains some of the finest examples of potential prairie wilderness left in the nation, including the largest remaining roadless area in the Great Plains. Three areas—Red Shirt, Indian Creek, and Chalk Hills—have been proposed for wilderness designation by the South Dakota Wild Grassland Coalition, which is working hard to protect these areas as a legacy to South Dakotans. Red Shirt comprises approximately 16,000 acres and is characterized by colorful striped buttes, mounds and cones rising to stunning grassy plateaus and ridge lines, with Schumacher Canyon and its exposed layers of color-banded clays on steep slopes as its centerpiece. It is northwest of the Pine Ridge Native Reservation and was used by the Lakota for shelter, food, medicinal plants, and burial sites until the Native Wars ended. One can still find remnants of that time throughout the area. Red Shirt borders Black Hills National Forest, where the contrast in landscapes is marked. Black Elk Wilderness, which lies within the forest, contains [[Black Elk Peak]], the highest U.S. pinnacle east of the Rocky Mountains. Hikers can get a stunning view of this from Red Shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewenvironment.org/news-room/other-resources/south-dakotas-red-shirt-proposed-wilderness-85899442712#sthash.O87f1RqT.dpuf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910025135/http://www.pewenvironment.org/news-room/other-resources/south-dakotas-red-shirt-proposed-wilderness-85899442712#sthash.O87f1RqT.dpuf#sthash.O87f1RqT.dpuf |archive-date=2013-09-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Richmond Night Market''' is an annual [[night market]] held through the summer months in [[Richmond, British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It runs on weekends and is held near [[Bridgeport Station (TransLink)|Bridgeport Station]] and [[River Rock Casino]]. Until 2007, it was held at the Vulcan Way location behind [[Home Depot]], but in 2008, the competing Summer Night Market was able to secure the lease to the Vulcan Way location.&lt;ref name="taste"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100812020527/http://www.vancouversun.com/Night+Market+offers+tantalizing+taste+Asian+culture/3048658/story.html Night Market offers a tantalizing taste of Asian culture | The Vancouver Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; Richmond's large immigrant population has provided a strong Asian influence to the night markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Broom |first=Jack |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/outdoors/2009379253_nwwmarket25.html |title=Cheap socks?

==History==

The Richmond Night Market was first held in 2000 at the Continental Centre. By 2003, it was moved to [[Lansdowne Centre]] to accommodate its growth. As attendance continued to increase, it moved again to the present site of the River Rock Casino Resort and finally to River Rd. Over 30,000 people visit the night market each night.

At its peak, the Richmond Night Market had over 400 booths selling mostly Asian cuisine, merchandise, and entertainment. Entrance to the market was free, though parking on site near the entrance can cost as high as $5.50 for the evening. Currently, year 2012, there is free parking and only a small admission fee. The merchandise sold at the night market is of a lower price point than traditional retail stores and primarily imported from Asia.

In October 2007, the Richmond Night Market's lease on Vulcan Way expired.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/richmondnews/news/story.html?id=df0c8abe-8ed3-44b4-b5c7-042d853e275b&amp;k=98766 |title=Councillor eyes space under Canada Line &amp;#124; Richmond News |publisher=Canada.com |date=2007-08-14 |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104054726/http://www.canada.com/richmondnews/news/story.html?id=df0c8abe-8ed3-44b4-b5c7-042d853e275b&amp;k=98766 |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The landlord  and Target Event Production Ltd. were unable to negotiate a new lease, primarily due to a rent increase.&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/article-140044/2008-richmond-night-market-cancelled |title=2008 Richmond Night Market canceled |publisher=Straight.com |date=2008-04-07 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Target Event Production Ltd. attempted to find an alternative location, within Richmond, to host the night market for 2008. However, they were not able to find a venue in time, in Richmond or anywhere else within Metro Vancouver.  It was then announced through a press release that the Richmond Night Market was canceled.&lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt;

A new location was found for the return of the Richmond Night Market for 2010. However, due to cost concerns, plans for the new location were dropped.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;[http://www.bclocalnews.com/richmond_southdelta/richmondreview/news/92879749.html Night market fates determined soon | Richmond Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511005743/http://www.bclocalnews.com/richmond_southdelta/richmondreview/news/92879749.html |date=May 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, they made a comeback with the night market on from May 18 to October 8, with a new location next to [[Skytrain (Vancouver)|Skytrain]] [[Canada Line]]s' [[Bridgeport Station (TransLink)|Bridgeport Station]] and [[River Rock Casino]].

==Developments==
By March 2008, a new location for the Richmond Night Market had not been found. Target Events Production Ltd. had stated that it would require about {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of paved land to hold the event. Discussions had been taking place with other cities and municipalities but it was hoped that the market would remain in Richmond, BC. In April 2008, Target Events Production Ltd. issued a news release canceling the event for 2008 and stated it would attempt to find an alternative location for the following year.&lt;ref name="ref4"/&gt;

Another promoter, not affiliated with the Richmond Night Market, hosted the night market in 2008 and has continued to do so. The succeeding promoter, Lions Communication Inc. renamed the event from Richmond Night Market to "Summer Night Market".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summernightmarket.com/cp-7-News28Mar2008.html |title=Summer Night Market - March 28, 2008 News Release (at archive.org) |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708235053/http://www.summernightmarket.com/cp-7-News28Mar2008.html |archivedate=July 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a hearing at Richmond City Hall on 20 May 2008, the Summer Night Market was granted a permit for two-years operation at the Vulcan Way location.&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/richmondnews/news/story.html?id=a91a8771-3ea8-41ad-bc29-265961ca2559 |title=New night market operator wins approval &amp;#124; Richmond News |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108193955/http://www.canada.com/richmondnews/news/story.html?id=a91a8771-3ea8-41ad-bc29-265961ca2559 |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season took place between May 30 and 5 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vancouver |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=8f816a43-5300-4557-ba3e-5dc3c7ace299 |title=Richmond night market gets the nod from council &amp;#124; The Vancouver Province |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108194743/http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=8f816a43-5300-4557-ba3e-5dc3c7ace299 |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival for 2009 started on 15 May 2009 and ended on 4 October 2009. The festival for 2010 started on May 21, in order to coincide with start of the May long weekend, and is scheduled to finish on October 5.

In early May 2008, the site was subject to suspicious vandalism which caused Lions Communication Inc. to power the night market with emergency generators while electrical repairs estimated at $100,000 were made. The main service pole was cut down and the fuses and wiring were ripped out. The RCMP had investigated and no charges were laid.&lt;ref name="ref7"/&gt;

Lions Communications Inc. has previous experience in organizing various night markets both in Richmond and [[Vancouver]], notably the first night market of its kind for Richmond in the 1998 Continental Square Mid Autumn Festival along with the Chinese New Year Night Market at [[Lansdowne Centre]] which ran for 6 consecutive years starting from 1999. This company also includes the core operators behind Paradise Entertainment, a company which has organized events such as the Molson Indy opening ceremonies, Mid Autumn Festival 1995 and Chinese New Year celebrations in 1998 at the [[Plaza of Nations]] in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This company has also stated that they will reduce parking costs compared to previous years and improve access to the night market site.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In October 2009, Raymond Cheung stated a new location was found and will be located in New Westminster, BC. Cheung had previously promoted the night market at its future location, as being the 'largest in North America' when it opens for 2010. The night market was planned to run from May 21 until October 11, operating Friday, Saturday, Sunday and holiday evenings. Target Entertainment Inc. had formed a partnership with Starlight Casino for the event. The planned area offered 1000 free parking spots. It was expected the night market would draw around 10,000 visitors per week and two million over the course of the year, said Darren Harding, executive general manager of the casino. However, before the night market can be permitted to open, approval from New Westminster City Council was needed, which is also requesting a traffic impact study be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:7KpqExD8oIAJ:www.richmondnightmarket.com/pdf/www-bclocalnews-com_greater_vancouver_newwestminsternewsleader_news_645.pdf&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi7XIbggYTjyzvbJPdWc_ZD3XN7VGKoQXpocHGFYK4dAMdFh5Kjmdj02IthzKH6H-lGYJrIcRJHfrdakeJawYmcFT-d1ZBgndhbfgi5giO2gsLC_bdHP2xraG_EPGrGvlJGqum9&amp;sig=AHIEtbR3PwIbJmTeOnTLKBftp55KKoiGCw |title=Night market in New West to be 'largest in North America' &amp;#124; New Westminster News Leader (at Google docs) |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2010, more than 60 people attended the Queensborough Residents Association where plans for the Richmond Night Market were discussed.&lt;ref name="ref11"&gt;[http://www.bclocalnews.com/greater_vancouver/newwestminsternewsleader/community/82841812.html Night Market meeting draws a crowd | New Westminster News Leader]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Residents expressed concerns over the market traffic and parking.  The association formed a community advisory group to further investigate  the issues. Queensborough residents also raised questions about how potential crime, litter, and lighting from the market would be dealt with.

Organizers for the Richmond Night Market and Summer Night Market had planned, in 2010, to hold two separate competing night markets. However, on 16 April 2010, a few weeks prior to the planned re-opening at the Queensborough location, Starlight Casino gave notice to New Westminster's city planning department that they were formally withdrawing their application for a temporary use permit to host the night market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclocalnews.com/greater_vancouver/newwestminsternewsleader/news/91116259.html New Westminster night market canceled | New Westminster News Leader] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704090302/http://www.bclocalnews.com/greater_vancouver/newwestminsternewsleader/news/91116259.html |date=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint press release from Raymond Cheung of Target Events Production Ltd. and Starlight Casino followed announcing the cancellation to select media by email on April 19. Starlight Casino general manager Tim Barnett explained that it was due to the scaling down of vendors from 300 to 225, increasing operating costs from policing, providing traffic management plans, and ensuring additional parking for vendors, had made operating the night market adjacent to the casino "no longer sustainable". In the end only the Summer Night Market in Richmond was able to open on schedule for the 2010 Victoria Day Long Weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclocalnews.com/greater_vancouver/newwestminsternewsleader/newFs/91708339.html Richmond Night Market searches for new home | New Westminster News Leader]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new temporary home has yet to be found, and might not be ready until 2011. Besides the location in New Westminster, Cheung has suggested returning the Richmond Night Market to central Richmond as a possibility.&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/richmondnews/news/story.html?id=9f737e51-9295-45c7-b735-8c95b93effce |title=Summer Night Market permit edges closer &amp;#124; Richmond News |publisher=.canada.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==

Previously, Raymond Cheung of Target Event Production Ltd. was hoping to continue his night market at a different location in 2009 and had filed a lawsuit against Paul Cheung (no relation) of Lions Communication Inc., alleging trademark infringement over the name of the night market and copyright infringement on the vendor application forms. Paul Cheung said the allegations are without merit, stating night markets are "not an exclusive concept".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sun |first=Vancouver |url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=dca46e1f-702d-4f0f-b670-843650787f04&amp;sponsor= |title=Richmond night market may get another life &amp;#124; '&amp;#39;The Vancouver Sun'&amp;#39; |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108194823/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=dca46e1f-702d-4f0f-b670-843650787f04&amp;sponsor= |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between May 12–15 and 19–21, and June 10–11, 2009, a hearing in Federal Court occurred regarding copyright infringement between Target Event Production Ltd. and Paul Cheung and Lions Communication Inc.

On 11 January 2010, judgment was passed regarding copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="ref15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2010/2010fc27/2010fc27.html |title=Target Event Production Ltd. v. Cheung &amp;#124; Federal Court |publisher=Decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that the plaintiff (TARGET EVENT PRODUCTION LTD.) had acquired rights in four trademarks: RICHMOND NIGHT MARKET, RICHMOND NIGHT MARKET SUMMER FESTIVAL and Chinese characters for each of these. The trademarks were originally merely descriptive, but by January 2007 they were valid trademarks because they enjoyed substantial goodwill and had acquired distinctiveness in association with the plaintiff and the location of the market. However, the Court also concluded that the distinctiveness was not durable, and the trademarks lost their distinctiveness and associated goodwill when the Plaintiff failed to open another night market in 2009.&lt;ref name="ref16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trademarkblog.ca/trademark-issues-at-richmond-night-market/ |title=Trademark Issues at Richmond Night Market &amp;#124; Canadian Trademark Blog |publisher=Trademarkblog.ca |date=2010-03-05 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court concluded that the defendants (PAUL CHEUNG AND LIONS COMMUNICATIONS INC.) had failed to adequately distance themselves from Target's former business when trying to take advantage of the opportunity presented by Target's cessation of services. As a result, the Court found both copyright infringement and passing off, thus a ruling in favour of Target Event Production Ltd.

Damages in the amount of $15,000.00 plus costs and interest was awarded to the plaintiff, for which the Lions Communication Inc. and Paul Cheung are both liable to pay.

Lions Communications Inc. is currently appealing the Federal Court's January decision. Paul Cheung, while okay with the name change, does not believe the floor plan (which details where vendor booths and the stage are to be set up), can be considered "intellectual property" and subject to copyright.&lt;ref name="ref17"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100603181423/http://www.vancouversun.com/Richmond+market+back+despite+legal+tussle/3091734/story.html Richmond market is back, despite legal tussle | The Vancouver Sun]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name change, Raymond Cheung also threatened to sue media outlets that used the words "Richmond Summer Night Market" in news stories or advertisements.&lt;ref name="sued"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100924232022/http://www.richmond-news.com/news/night+market+being+sued/2880893/story.html New night market being sued | Richmond News]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Roving Mars'' has made over [[US$]]10 million as of January 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/mv/boxoffice/weekend/ |title=Movie Box Office &amp;#124; Highest Grossing Movies - Yahoo!

''Roving Mars'' is also the title of a non-fiction book by MER principal investigator [[Steve Squyres]] about the rover mission.

==Music==
The [[film score|musical score]] for ''Roving Mars'' was composed by [[Philip Glass]]. A soundtrack album was released by [[Lakeshore Records]] on June 27, 2006. The album also features the song "[[Glósóli]]" by [[Sigur Rós]].

==Reception==
''Roving Mars'' received positive reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a 70% rating based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. Its consensus states that "''Roving Mars'' is a decent thrill ride even when it starts feeling like a commercial plug for NASA's failing space program."

''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the film a B-, stating that "Only a series of pics featuring a set of strange little nodes that look like blueberries planted in a pile of red rocks carry any kind of translatable otherworldly kick." The ''New York Post'' called it a "splendidly photographed 2D IMAX film." The ''Boston Globe'' said "Despite audiences knowing the happy ending from the get-go, [director] [George] Butler manages to inject considerable drama."

Conversely, the ''Los Angeles Times'' claimed, "Not having a way to capture images of the machines at work means that too much of Butler's film... is disappointingly made up of computer simulations.", while the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' claimed that "There aren't enough pyrotechnics in the paltry 40-minute run time to justify the ticket price."

'''Sand animation''' is the manipulation of sand to create [[animation]]. In [[performance art]] an artist creates a series of images using [[sand]], a process which is achieved by applying sand to a surface and then rendering images by drawing lines and figures in the sand with one's hands. A sand animation performer will often use the aid of an [[overhead projector]] or [[lightbox]] (similar to one used by photographers to view [[Reversal film|translucent films]]). To make an animated film, sand is moved on a backlit or frontlit piece of glass to create each frame.

Techniques for animating with sand were pioneered by [[Caroline Leaf]] when she was an undergraduate art student at [[Harvard University]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nfb.ca/film/handcrafted_cinema|title=Hand-Crafted Cinema Animation Workshop with Caroline Leaf|last=Roberts|first=Eric|year=1998|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created her first film, ''Sand, or Peter and the Wolf'' (1968), by dumping beach sand on a light box and manipulating the grains to build figures, textures and movement frame-by-frame.&lt;ref name="HARV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2012octdec/leaf.html|title=The Animated Art of Caroline Leaf|date=November 5, 2012|work=Film Series / Events|publisher=Harvard College Library|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, [[Eli Noyes]], another Harvard graduate, created the noted ''Sandman'' short film (1973) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Griffin | first=George | title=Cartoon, Anti-Cartoon | journal=The American Animated Cartoon | editor=Donald Peary and Gerald Peary | year=1980 | page=261-268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.filmpreservation.org/preserved-films/2016-federal-grant-winners|title=Sandman|work=2016 Federal Grant Winners|publisher=National Film Preservation Foundation|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Sand Alphabet'' (1974) which became a feature on the children's educational television program ''Sesame Street''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Educational Film Library Association | title=Motion pictures in education | journal=Sightlines | year=1976 | volume=10-11 | page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, ''[[The Sand Castle (film)|The Sand Castle]]'' by Dutch-Canadian animator [[Co Hoedeman]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]. &lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Gary|title=In the National Interest: A Chronicle of the National Film Board of Canada from 1949 to 1989|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-0802068330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gM2j0CN64isC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=The+Sand+Castle+Co+Hoedeman#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Sand%20Castle%20Co%20Hoedeman&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 March 2012|page=232|date=30 September 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About||the 2017 Korean film|Single Rider (film)}}
'''Single rider''' lines are an opportunity at various theme parks to reduce the amount of time waiting in line for an attraction. When a single-rider line is in use, empty seats on the ride vehicles are filled using individuals from the line, thus ensuring that every vehicle is carrying the maximum number of occupants possible. A park using a single-rider line offers guests a chance to wait for a significantly shorter length of time in exchange for not necessarily being able to experience the attraction with others in their party or from a desired seat (e.g., the front row of a [[roller coaster]]).

==Operations==
In practice, a single-rider line is available adjacent to the main entrance of the attraction.  It is often manned by a park employee who will remind guests of any important policies.  The line may bypass pre-show elements of the attraction; again, this is a trade-off that allows a much shorter wait in line.  Typically, the line ends at the loading platform, where another employee is stationed.  This employee will sort out the arriving guests from the main line and direct them to the ride vehicles.  When an empty seat becomes available, the employee will direct the person at the front of the single-rider line to take the empty seat.

The actual movement of the line is subject to many variables, including the loading speed of the attraction and, sometimes, the park's management style for dealing with such lines.  Some parks will use single riders to fill odd-numbered seating configurations every time, while others will actively attempt to balance out the ride vehicle with guests in the main line, even inviting guests from further back in the main line to come forward and board. Generally, single rider lines are used for rides which have vehicles of four to eight people and are popular. Single rider lines can reduce wait times by 80% or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faqorlando.com/planning-an-orlando-trip/orlandos-single-rider-lines/|title=Orlando’s single rider lines|work=FAQ Orlando}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rides may seat three individuals across, and due to the number of couples that visit theme parks, the third individual is needed to fill the row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pe.com/iguide/family/family-headlines/20120620-theme-parks-single-rider-option-saves-time.ece|title=THEME PARKS: Single rider option saves time|author=FIELDING BUCK|date=20 June 2012|work=Press Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because single rider lines are normally used to fill up otherwise empty seats, they have no direct, negative impact on the main queue. This is different from paid priority queues, in which visitors are allowed to jump the main queue for an upcharge, taking away available rides.

In most cases, a guest using a single-rider line must meet the normal rider requirements for the attraction and must be able to ride in any empty seat presented. Therefore, a number of park guests are generally discouraged from using these lines, such as:
* Younger guests, who may not meet the height requirement for the attraction but would otherwise be able to ride if a parent or guardian was present (a responsibility the park will not impose on a stranger)
* Handicapped guests, who might require special wheelchair seating or need assistance from a member of their party to board the attraction
* Guests with larger frames (some muscular or obese guests), who would require a specific seat (one modified for larger guests) to experience the attraction&lt;ref name="Glass"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Glass|title=Things To Do At Disneyland 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyzu4s8GpgcC&amp;pg=PT22|publisher=Alternative Travel Press|pages=22–27|id=GGKEY:9XZ3XH94302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Single-rider lines may be discontinued at the discretion of the park at any time, usually when there is no perceivable benefit to using the line. This can occur during off-peak operating days when the regular wait is very short already. Similarly, it may be temporarily discontinued when the single-rider line length creates waits that are longer than those for the regular line.

Some parks provide provisions for visitors who are alone, regardless of whether a "single-rider line" is designated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/travel/articles/2012/06/29/20120629disneyland-single-rider-line-tips.html|title=Disneyland: Single-rider line reduces wait|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not specifically a single-rider plan, some parks provide provisions for parents of children who are too small or young for an attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/rider-switch/|title=Rider Switch|work=Walt Disney World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disneylandparis.com/nl/good_to_know/park_information/park_services.htm disneylandparis.com] Praktische informatie&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g29092-c4552/Anaheim:California:Disneyland.With.Babies.html Tripadvisor] Anaheim: Disneyland with babies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efteling.com/NL/Park/Voorzieningen/Voorzieningen-Baby-Switch.html Efteling] Baby switch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://park.hongkongdisneyland.com/hkdl/en_US/general/guestServices?name=SpecialNeedsGuestServicesPage Hong Kong Disneyland] Guests with Special Needs&lt;/ref&gt; One party waits with the non-riders, until a responsible adult returns, then the waiting party enters the front of the single-rider line or another line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://california.legoland.com/FAQ/parent_swap/ Legoland Californië] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217122031/http://california.legoland.com/FAQ/parent_swap/ |date=2014-12-17 }} Parent Swap&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phantasialand.de/nl/informatie-service/voor-families Phantasialand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902170643/http://www.phantasialand.de/nl/informatie-service/voor-families |date=2014-09-02 }} Voor gezinnen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familyvacationcritic.com/seaworld-orlando-planning-and-tips/dtp/ Family vacation Critic] SeaWorld Orlando Planning &amp; Tips&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tokyodisneyresort.co.jp/en/faq/park.html Tokyo Disney Resort] FAQ - At the parks&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.universalorlando.com/Resort-Information/Traveling-with-Kids.aspx Universal Orlando Resort] Traveling with Kids&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beaconfell.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Beacon Fell, looking across Beacon Tarn.]]'''''The Outlying Fells of Lakeland''''' is a book written by [[Alfred Wainwright]], dealing with hills in and around the [[Lake District]] of [[England]]. It differs from Wainwright's ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells|Pictorial Guides]]'' in that each of its 56 chapters describes a walk, sometimes taking in several summits, rather than a single fell. This has caused some confusion on the part of authors attempting to prepare a definitive list of peaks. The Outlying Fells do not form part of the 214 hills generally accepted as making up the [[List of Wainwrights|Wainwrights]], but they are included in Category 2B of the Hill Walkers Register&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldwa.org.uk/hillwalkers/register2.php Hill Walkers Register]&lt;/ref&gt; maintained by the Long Distance Walkers Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldwa.org.uk/ Long Distance Walkers Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fells included==
The arrangement of chapters in the book is clockwise starting in the south east, with the first chapter devoted to [[Scout Scar]], a walk starting at [[Kendal]] Town Hall.

The list at the back of Wainwright's book contains 110 named fells and summits. Close inspection shows seven of them to refer to other hills in the list, while Newton Fell has two summits. Thus:

*[[Cartmel Fell]] is the same as Ravens Barrow (page 42).
*[[Hollow Moor]] is the summit of Green Quarter Fell (page 14).
*[[Hooker Crag]] is the summit of Muncaster fell (page 186).
*[[Newton Fell]] includes Newton Fell (North) and Newton Fell (South) (page 53).
*[[Potter Fell]] is the name given to the hill whose summits are Brunt Knotts and Ulgraves (page 8).
*[[Lord's Seat (Whitbarrow)|Lord's Seat]] is the summit of Whitbarrow (page 36).
*[[Williamson's Monument]] is the same as High Knott (page 18).
*[[Woodland Fell]] is the name of the moor of which Yew Bank and Wool Knott are high points (page 102).

The addition of the 12 nameless summits brings the number of Wainwright's Outlying Fells to 116. This is 14 more than the 102 hills listed in John M. Turner's ''New Combined Indexes to A. Wainwright's Pictorial Guides'' (second edition, Lingdales Press, 1984). Turner's list omits two tops explicitly mentioned in the book (St. John's Hill and Newton Fell South) and the 12 nameless summits, and it contains many inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;For more up-to-date heights, grid references and other data, see the [http://www.hills-database.co.uk/downloads.html Database of British and Irish Hills]&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition of the book, revised by [[Chris Jesty]], was published by [[Frances Lincoln Publishers|Frances Lincoln]]  in 2011 ({{ISBN|978-0-7112-3175-7}}).  It maintains the same format but uses red to highlight paths on the route diagrams, and includes updated content (e.g. for [[Staveley Fell]] where Jesty says (p.&amp;nbsp;49)  "There must be many people who, encouraged ... by the first edition of this book, have turned left and ... been turned back by an uncrossable fence." before providing an alternative route.)

==Highest and lowest==
The highest three summits listed by Wainwright are:
*[[Walna Scar]] {{convert|2035|ft|m}}
*[[Black Combe]] {{convert|1970|ft|m}}
*[[Great Yarlside]] {{convert|1986|ft|m}}

The lowest summits are:
*[[Humphrey Head]] {{convert|172|ft|m}}, of which Wainwright says ''"A fell it certainly is not, being a meagre 172 feet above the sea..."''
*[[Cartmel Fell|Cartmel Fell/Raven's Barrow]] {{convert|500|ft|m}}
*[[Newton Fell South]] {{convert|585|ft|m}}

==List of summits==
&lt;!-- Where a chapter name is a fell name but not the named summit, this table should include details at the summit name and a "chapter see fell" link at the chapter name - eg Cartmel Fell --&gt;
The list below has been arranged in alphabetical order rather than height in order to align as far as possible with the list at the back of Wainwright's book.  Summits are listed by the name used in the Database of British and Irish Hills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Version 12.1|url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/downloads.html|work=Database of British and Irish Hills|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with cross-references from other summit names used by Wainwright to the entries in this table. Each summit appears only once, with height and grid reference. The "page" column allows the list to be sorted into Wainwright's order of chapters, which is roughly geographical, moving clockwise round the area from Kendal in the east.

==Map==
The map marks the highest point reached on each of Wainwright's 56 walks. The number adjacent to each point gives the page number of the corresponding chapter in the book and the colour indicates the general height of the summit. Clicking a number provides a link to the article about the fell in question.

&lt;!--
There seems to be a problem with the [[Template:Location map~ so that sometimes the marks and annotation for a mountain are not clickable. This seems to be associated with nearby text rather than with the data for the mountain itself. By positioning the annotation carefully (top, right, bottom and right} I think I have got all the annotation, but not all the marks, to link properly. User:Thincat

'''''The Triumph of Beauty''''' is a [[Literature in English#Caroline and Cromwellian literature|Caroline]] era [[masque]], written by [[James Shirley]] and first published in [[1646 in literature|1646]]. The masque shows a strong influence of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]].''

The plot of the masque draws upon one of the most famous tales of [[Greek mythology]], the [[Judgement of Paris]]; Shirley derives some material from the ''Dialogues'' of [[Lucian]]. (Shirley had previously used the same subject matter in the masque in Act V of his [[1640 in literature|1640]] play ''[[The Constant Maid]].'') The cast includes all the principals of the story, with the divinities occurring in their Roman versions: [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], [[Hera|Juno]], [[Aphrodite|Venus]], and [[Athena|Pallas]] all appear, along with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Cupid]], [[Hymenaios|Hymen]], the [[Charites|Graces]], the [[Horae|Hours]], and a personified [[Hedone|Delight]]. (The three Hours, [[Eunomia (goddess)|Eunomia]], [[Dike (mythology)|Dike]] and [[Eirene (Greek goddess)|Eirene]], also appear in Shirley's ''[[The Triumph of Peace]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;Both works, ''Beauty'' and ''Peace,'' refer to the "feather-footed Hours," a phrase that also occurs in the play ''[[The Country Captain]],'' which Shirley may have helped the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] to write. Forsythe, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; The figures of the anti-masque are seven shepherds, Bottle, Crab, Clout, Toadstool, Shrub, Scrip, and Hobbinoll; as a group they resemble the comic Athenians in Shakespeare's ''Dream,'' with Bottle as Shirley's version of Bottom. The scene is set at [[Mount Ida]], in keeping with the traditional story; the masque ends with Venus's victory in the contest of beauty, and makes no mention of the ensuing events (that is, the [[Trojan War]]).

The text of the masque was first published in the [[book size|octavo]] volume of Shirley's ''Poems'' that was issued in 1646 by the bookseller [[Humphrey Moseley]]. The masque was also, apparently, sometimes bound and sold as a separate volume.&lt;ref&gt;Greg, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the London theatres closed in 1642 at the start of the [[English Civil War]], Shirley made his living as a schoolteacher, and created his final dramatic works for student performance. His late works ''[[Honoria and Mammon]],'' ''[[The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses]],'' and ''[[Cupid and Death]]'' fall into this category. The 1646 title page of ''The Triumph of Beauty'' states that the masque "was personated by some young Gentlemen, for whom it was intended, at a private Recreation." Judging by its publication date, ''The Triumph of Beauty'' may have been the earliest of these pedagogic dramas.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The music for the masque was composed by [[William Lawes]], who also composed the music for Shirley's ''[[The Triumph of Peace]].''&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, p. 161; Walls, pp. 334-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The wise fool''', or '''the''' '''wisdom of the fool,''' is a form of [[Paradox (literature)|literary paradox]] in which through a narrative a character recognized as a fool comes to be seen as a beholder of wisdom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55800981|title="Wisdom of the Fool."

In turn, the wise fool is often opposed to learned or elite knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While examples of the paradox can be found in a wide range of early world literature, from [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] works to the oral traditions of [[Folklore|folk culture]], the paradox received unprecedented attention from authors and artists during the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More than [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] for his range of clownish wise men or [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] for his lunatic genius [[Don Quixote|Don Quijote]], sixteenth century scholar [[Erasmus]] is often credited for creating the definitive wise fool and most famous paradox in western literature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/778636649|title=Behler, E.H.

While society reprimands violent maniacs, destined to be locked away in jails or asylums, the harmless fool often receives kindnesses and benefits from the social elite.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25707836|title=Majnūn : the madman in medieval Islamic society|last=1942-|first=Dols, Michael W.

This ability to be reckless, honest, and free with language has greatly contributed to the wise fool's popularity in the literary imagination.

''To call a man a fool is not necessarily an insult, for the authentic life has frequently been pictured under the metaphor of the fool. In figures such as Socrates, Christ, and the Idiot of Dostoyevsky we see that foolishness and wisdom are not always what they seem to be.'' - [[Sam Keen]], Apology for Wonder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keen, Sam|title=Apology for Wonder |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
The employment and occupation of the fool played a significant role in the ancient world. The Ancient Greek authors [[Xenophon]] and [[Athenaeus]] wrote of normal men hired to behave as insane fools and clowns while the Roman authors [[Lucian]] and [[Plautus]] left records of powerful Romans who housed deformed buffoons famous for their insolence and brazen madness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Plato]], through the guise of [[Socrates]], provides an early example of the wisdom of the fool in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' through the figure of an escaped prisoner in [[Allegory of the Cave|The Allegory of the Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/908430812|title=Republic|last=Plato.|date=2015|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=067499650X|oclc=908430812}}&lt;/ref&gt; The escaped prisoner, part of a group imprisoned from birth, returns to free his fellow inmates but is regarded as a madman in his attempts to convince his shackled friends of a greater world beyond the cave.

Numerous scholars have long regarded Socrates as the paramount wise fool of [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through what would come be to branded as [[Socratic irony]], the philosopher was known to make fools of people who claimed to be wise by pretending to be an ignorant fool himself.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary under ''irony.''&lt;/ref&gt; His name also bears a strong association with the [[I know that I know nothing|Socratic Paradox]], "I know that I know nothing," a statement that has come to frame him in the oxymoron of the ignorant knower. In Plato's [[Apology (Plato)|Apology]], this self admission of ignorance ultimately leads the [[Pythia|oracle at Delphi]] to claim there is no man with greater wisdom than Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1050649303|title=Apology|last=Plato.|isbn=1504052137|oclc=1050649303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval ===
The wise fool manifested most commonly throughout the Middle Ages as a religious figure in stories and poetry.  During the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (approx. 750 - 1280 CE), an entire literary genre formed around reports about the "intelligent insane."&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25707836|title=Majnūn : the madman in medieval Islamic society|last=1942-|first=Dols, Michael W. (Michael Walters),|date=1992|publisher=Clarendon Press|others=Immisch, Diana E.|isbn=0198202210|location=Oxford|oclc=25707836}}&lt;/ref&gt; One book in particular, ''Kitab Ugala al-majanin'', by an-Naysaburi, a muslim author from the [[Abbasid period|Abbasid Period]], recounts the lives of numerous men and women recognized during their lifetimes as 'wise fools.'&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Folkloric variations of madmen, lost between wisdom and folly, also appear throughout the period's most enduring classic, [[One Thousand and One Nights|The Thousand and One Nights]]. Buhlil the Madman, also known as the Lunatic of Kufa and Wise Buhlil, is often credited as the prototype for the wise fool across the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/148646349|title=Fools are everywhere : the court jester around the world|last=K.|first=Otto, Beatrice|date=2001|publisher=Univ of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226640921|oclc=148646349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holy fool|The fool for God's sake]] was a figure that appeared in both the Muslim and Christian world. Often wearing little to no clothes, this variant of the [[Foolishness for Christ|holy fool]] would forego all social customs and conventions and feign madness in order to be possessed with their creator's spirit.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; By the twelfth century in France, such feigning led to [[Feast of Fools|the Fête des Fous]] (Feast of Fools), a celebration in which clergy were allowed to behave as fools without inhibition or restraint.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During [[Crusades|the Crusades]], Christ was recognized as a 'wise fool' figure through his childlike teachings that yet confounded the powerful and intellectual elite. Numerous other writers during this period would explore this theological paradox of the wise fool in Christ, sustaining the trope into the Renaissance.

=== Renaissance ===
[[File:The_praise_of_folly_Fleuron_T140366-21.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_praise_of_folly_Fleuron_T140366-21.png|thumb|''Erasmus and Stultitia, the Goddess of Folly, are joined through literature. Engraving by W. Kennet, late [[Bishop of Peterborough|Lord Bishop of Peterborough]]. Based on the designs of the painter [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbeine]].''|287x287px]]
The wise fool received tremendous popularity in the literary imagination during the [[Italian Renaissance|Italian]] and [[English Renaissance|English Renaissances]]. In Italian scholar Erasmus' ''[[In Praise of Folly|Moriae encomium]],'' written in 1509 and first published in 1511, the author portrays [[In Praise of Folly|Stultitia]], the goddess of folly, and a wise fool herself, who asks what it means to be a fool and puts forth a brazen argument praising folly and claiming that all people are fools of one kind or another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855542|title=Living without philosophy : on narrative, rhetoric, and morality|last=1967-|first=Levine, Peter,|date=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0585062382|location=Albany, N.Y.|oclc=42855542}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to scholar Walter Kaiser, Stultitia is "the foolish creation of the most learned man of  his time, she is the literal embodiment of the word  ''oxymoron,'' and in her idiotic wisdom she represents the  finest flowering of that fusion of Italian humanistic  thought and northern piety which has been called  [[Christian humanism|Christian Humanism]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the same time,  Shakespeare greatly helped popularize the wise fool in the English theater through incorporating the trope in a variety of characters throughout many of his plays.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeares-fools|title=Shakespeare's fools|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Shakespeare's early plays largely portray the wise fool in comic terms as a buffoon, the later plays characterize the fool in a much more melancholic and contemplative light.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; For example, in ''[[King Lear]]''&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/931813845|title=The tragedy of King Lear|last=author.|first=Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616,|isbn=9781501118111|oclc=931813845}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Fool becomes the only one capable of speaking truth to the King and often takes on the role of revealing life's tragic nature to those around him. For Shakespeare, the trope became so well-known that when [[Olivia (Twelfth Night)|Olivia]] says of the clown [[Feste]] in [[Twelfth Night]], "This fellow is wise enough to play the fool" (III.i.60), his audiences recognized it as a popular convention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Numerous other authors rendered interpretations of the wise fool across the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries from [[Hans Sachs]] to [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]. The image of the wise fool is as well found in numerous Renaissance artworks by a range of artists including [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Breughel]], [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]], and [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein the Younger]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Spain, Cervantes' novel [[Don Quixote]] exemplifies the world of the wise fool through both its title character and his companion, Sancho Panza.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Close|first=A. J.|date=1973|title=Sancho Panza: Wise Fool|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3725864|journal=The Modern Language Review|volume=68|issue=2|pages=344–357|doi=10.2307/3725864}}&lt;/ref&gt;
