The ways in which [[glass]] was exchanged throughout ancient times is intimately related to its production and is a stepping stone to learning about the economies and interactions of ancient societies.  Because of its nature it can be shaped into a variety of forms and as such is found in different archaeological contexts (window panes, jewellery, tableware...). This is important because it can inform on how different industries of sections of societies related to each other – both within a cultural region or with foreign societies.

Glass trade is mainly studied by compositional analysis of glass objects creating groups with specific chemical compositions that hopefully allow to differentiate between production centres (both geographically and chronologically). Complications arise from the fact that for long periods of time glass was made following very similar recipes and as such the major elements found do not vary significantly. It is made by a mixture of raw materials which means that different sources of each raw material even for the same production centre further complicate the situation. That it is a material that lends itself well to recycling can only add to this. However, as scientific techniques improve it is becoming increasingly possible to discern some compositional groups, together with other archaeological and textual evidence a picture of glass technology, industry and exchange is starting to emerge.

== Mesopotamia and Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age ==
{{see also|History of glass|Hellenistic glass}}
Glass beads are known from the 3rd millennium BC but it is only in the late 2nd millennium that glass finds start occurring more frequently, primarily in Egypt and Mesopotamia.  This is not to say that it was a widespread commodity, quite the contrary.  It was a material for high-status objects with archaeological evidence for the Late Bronze Age (LBA) also showing an almost exclusive distribution of glass finds at palace complexes such as that found in the city of Amarna – Egypt.  Texts listing offerings to Egyptian temples would start with gold and silver, followed by precious stones (lapis lazuli) and then bronze, copper and other not so precious stones with glass mentioned together with the lapis lazuli.  ''In this period it was rare and precious and its use largely restricted to the elite.'' &lt;ref&gt;Shortland 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest glass ingot was discovered in the 1300 B.C. Egyptian [[Uluburun]] shipwreck off the coast of Turkey &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/travel/12-amazing-sunken-treasure-discoveries-20130816?pageno=13|title=Sunken Treasures: The World's Most Valuable Shipwreck Discoveries|author= Liz Burlingame| date=Aug 23, 2013|publisher=The Weather Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of raw glass occurred at primary workshops of which only 3 are known, all in Egypt:  [[Amarna]], [[Pi-Ramesses]] and [[Malkata]].&lt;ref name="Walton et al 2009"&gt;Walton et al 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the first two sites cylindrical ceramic vessels with vitrified remains have been identified as glass crucibles&lt;ref&gt;Rehren &amp; Push 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson et al 1997&lt;/ref&gt; where the raw materials (quartz pebbles and plant ash) would be melted together with a colourant. The two sites seem to show a specialisation in colour, with blue glass, via the addition of cobalt, being produced at [[Amarna]] and red, through copper, at [[Pi-Ramesses]]. The resulting coloured glass would then be fashioned into actual objects at secondary workshops – far more common in the archaeological record. It seems certain that glass making was not exclusive to Egypt (in fact current scholarly opinion resides with the industry having originally been imported into the country) as there are Mesopotamian cuneiform texts which detail the recipes for the making of glass. Further supporting this hypothesis are the [[Amarna Letters]], a contemporaneous diplomatic correspondence detailing the demand and gift giving from vassal princes in Syro-Palestine to the Egyptian King, in these the most asked for item is glass.

The evidence then points to two regions that were making and exchanging glass. It seems logical to believe that at an initial stage it was glass objects, as opposed to raw glass, that were exchanged. The major element composition of glass finds from Mesopotamia and Egypt is indistinguishable with as much variation found within a specific assemblage than between different sites. This is indicative of the same recipe being used in both regions. As analytical techniques develop the presence of trace elements can be more accurately determined and it has been found that glass is compositionally identical within each region, but it is possible to discriminate between them.&lt;ref&gt;Shortland et al 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  This could be a huge step in uncovering trade patterns, however ''at present no Egyptian glass has been found in Mesopotamia, nor have any Mesopotamian glasses been found in Egypt''.&lt;ref name="Walton et al 2009"/&gt;

Across the sea, Mycenaean glass beads were found to have been made with glass from both regions. The fact that the beads are stylistically Mycenaean would imply an import of raw glass.&lt;ref name="Walton et al 2009"/&gt; Archaeological evidence for this trade comes from the [[Uluburun shipwreck]], dated to the 14th century BC.  As part of its cargo it carried 175 raw glass ingots of cylindrical shape. These ingots match the glass melting crucibles found at [[Amarna]] and [[Pi-Ramesses]]. 

It is not yet possible to discern if trade in glass was occurring directly between the glass producing regions and foreign consumers, it is quite possible that indirect routes via trading and seafaring partners along the Mediterranean coast,  trace element analysis of the Uluburun ingots might allow us to learn more.  At this point we know glass was being consumed by the elites of Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia, it was produced in Egypt and Mesopotamia with workshops possibly specialising in colour and distributed locally presumably through state control to state sponsored artisans, and exported further out as raw glass ingots.

== The Mediterranean during Roman times ==

From [[Hellenistic Glass|Hellenistic]] times glass production sees considerable technological developments culminating with the introduction of glass blowing in the 1st century BC. Glass objects could now be made in large scale production, with less raw material and faster and as a consequence became more common. From the early [[Roman glass|Roman times]], to Byzantine and early [[Glass in Islamic culture|Islamic]] periods the glass from Northern Europe to Eastern Mediterranean shows an incredible compositional homogeneity in its major elements. Unlike the LBA glass, Roman glass was made from the melting of sand and [[natron]] – mineral soda – from the Wadi Natron in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Freestone et al 2000"&gt;Freestone et al 2000&lt;/ref&gt; With one raw material being common to all glass it should be possible to differentiate between glass made from different sands using composition variation of the trace elements and certain isotope ratios.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter et al 2005, Freestone et al 2003, Leslie et al 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These compositional analyses aimed to investigate two models for glass production:
glass was produced in large scale primary workshops along the Levantine coast&lt;ref name="Freestone et al 2000"/&gt; and Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Nenna et al 2000&lt;/ref&gt; mixing natron and sand from the mouth of the Belus river – as mentioned by Pliny – and then traded to local glass working workshops. If natron was traded and mixed with local sands following a strict recipe could result in the homogeneous composition.

Glass making furnaces have been uncovered in Israel at two sites – 17 at Bet Eli'ezer and 3 at [[Apollonia-Arsuf|Apollonia]].&lt;ref name="Gorin-Rosen 2000"&gt;Gorin-Rosen 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These are rectangular in shape measuring about 2m x 4m and matching in size a glass slab found inside a cave at [[Beit She'arim National Park|Bet She'arim]]. The resulting slabs would be broken up into chunks that were traded to glass workshops in the Middle East and across the Mediterranean as evidenced by the contemporaneous shipwrecks carrying such glass chunks.&lt;ref name="Gorin-Rosen 2000"/&gt;

The situation is not so simple; these workshops are dated from the 6th to the 11th century AD and although similar the compositions do not exactly match those of the earlier Roman period. Pliny, writing in the 1st century AD, describes glass making in the Levantine coast but also in Italy, Spain and Gaul – however ''the installations that produced the large quantities of primary glass needed to supply the Roman industry have yet to be located''.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie et al 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These same authors report a difference in isotopic ratios for oxygen and strontium that differentiates between Middle eastern and Roman glasses. Other authors counter idea of a unique centralised production with primary production reported from Northern Europe&lt;ref&gt;Jackson et al 2003, Baxter et al 2005 and Wolf et al 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and inferred for Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Silvestri et al 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  	
Evidence for large scale production has only come the Eastern Mediterranean and from latter dates and assumes a continuing glass making tradition. That there was a large scale and centralised production even this early is evidenced by the Ouest Embiez I shipwreck – 3rd century – carrying 8 tons of raw glass.&lt;ref&gt;Foy &amp; Jezegou 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  This however does not exclude the smaller scale local production reported elsewhere.  The Julia Felix, also sunk during the 3rd century AD, was carrying as part of its cargo glass cullet presumably for recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Silvestri et al 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Trace element analysis of colourless glass showed these were made using sands from different sources and giving some support to the de-centralised production hypothesis.

By the 9th century the raw materials for glass shift again to quartz pebbles and plant ash and  the 'forest glass' of medieval Europe. Natron was no longer in use and the low lime composition of the Bet'eliezer glass would be suggestive of a decline in access to the material from at least the 6th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone &amp; Gorin-Rosen 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This could in turn be suggestive of a shift from a trade both in natron and raw glass to tighter control over natron and increase of centralised production.

== South East Asia,  Africa and the Indian Ocean ==

Glass shows up in Northern India at the end of the 2nd millennium BC becoming more common throughout South East Asia during the following millennium. [[glass beadmaking|Glass beads]] in particular become extremely popular and together with bangles form the largest group of glass finds. From its Indian origins, glass beads spread to an area from Africa to Japan, sailing with the monsoon winds and leading to their christening as 'Trade wind beads'.&lt;ref&gt;van der Sleen 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The most common compositional type, representing 40% of the glass finds for the region, is known as mineral soda-alumina glass&lt;ref&gt;Dussubieux et al 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and is found from the 4th century BC to the 16th century AD.  As the name indicates this it is typically characterized by a high alumina content and was made by the probably melting of ''reh'' with local, alumina rich, sands.&lt;ref&gt;Brill &amp; Rising 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Through LA-ICP-MS analysis, however, Carter found that Cambodia had a large amount of glass beads made of potash glass and predominantly high alumina soda glass. Potash glass is a glass that uses potash or K2O as a flux in order to decrease the melting point of the glass and is the most common type of glass found in SE Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Alison|title=Trade and Exchange networks in Iron Age Cambodia: Preliminary results from a compositional analysis of glass beads|journal=Journal of Indo-Pacific Archaeology|date=2011|pages=178–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed compositional data recently summarised by (Lankton, &amp; Dussubieux 2006) has uncovered several  distinct and yet contemporaneous glass technologies across the Indian Ocean, but the geographical assignment is not completely clear.  Two small groups show compositions matching those of natron based Mediterranean glass and Plant-ash Mesopotamian glass, demonstrating trade with these other regions. Trade in raw glass from Egypt to India was described in the 1st century texts of Periplus of the Erythraean, Mesopotamian glass increases in presence with increased [[sasanian glass|Sasanian]] control of the Indian Ocean from the 4th to 6th centuries. It is also possible that some glass was traded via the Silk Road.

The majority of glass beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa pre dating European contact are from Indian or Sri Lankan origin with a recent paper (Dussubieux et al. 2008) demonstrating contact between Kenyan sites and Chaul in the West coast of India for the 9th to the 19th century.  Previously analysed samples from the East coast of Africa and Madagascar could potentially  fit this group but further work is still needed. Whether Chaul was the single port for trade in glass beads or if it was part of several competing ports on that coast is still unknown. Data from a site in South Africa, near the borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe, has tentatively assigned some beads to Islamic 8th century compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Prinsloo &amp; Colomban 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the old camel caravan routes that connected this region to Egypt and the Mediterranean were still in use even for glass at a site with easy access, via the Limpopo river, to the Indian Ocean trade and therefore to the West Indian glass that seem to be the most common.There is enough evidence that in ancient Sri Lanka, glass was manufactured in order to use for magnifying glasses or spectacles.

'''Antonio Candido de Mello e Souza''' (July 24, 1918 – May 12, 2017) was a [[Brazil]]ian writer, professor, [[sociologist]] and [[literary critic]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cultura.estadao.com.br/noticias/literatura,morre-antonio-candido-aos-98-anos,70001776504|title=Morre Antonio Candido aos 98 anos|last=|first=|date=May 12, 2017|work=Estadão|access-date=May 12, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a critic of [[Brazilian literature]], he is regarded as having been one of the foremost [[scholars]] on the subject by Brazilian universities. He was the co-winner of the [[Prêmio Jabuti]] for essays in 1965 and was awarded the [[Prêmio Machado de Assis]] in 1993, the [[Camões Prize]] in 1998 and the [[Alfonso Reyes International Prize]] in 2005.

Candido was professor-emeritus at the [[University of São Paulo]] and [[São Paulo State University]] and doctor ''honoris causa'' by the [[University of Campinas]].

==Biography==
Son of Aristides Candido de Mello e Souza, M.D., and Clarisse Tolentino de Mello e Souza, most of Antonio Candido's childhood was spent in the Brazilian countryside, in the states of [[Minas Gerais]] and [[São Paulo]]. During this period, he did not attend school, being taught at home by his mother. In 1937 he and his family settled down in São Paulo, where he received formal education. In 1939, Candido began studying Law at the [[Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo|University of São Paulo School of Law]], a course he would eventually abandon in order to study philosophy at the same university.

His first critical works were published in 1941, in the magazine ''[[Clima]]'', co-founded by himself, and, in the following year, he began teaching at the University of São Paulo, first in the department of sociology and later, a position he would hold, although with a brief interval from 1958 to 1960, for thirty-six years. Candido also taught Brazilian Literature at the [[University of Paris]] from 1964 to 1966, and became [[visiting scholar]] at [[Yale University]] two years later.

His major work of literary criticism was published in 1959, entitled ''Formação da Literatura Brasileira'' (literally, "Formation of Brazilian Literature), a highly polemic and influential study of the foundations of his country's literary arts.

Candido was also active in politics during many periods of his life: he was a militant against [[Getúlio Vargas]]'s [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] and helped to found the [[Partido dos Trabalhadores|Worker's Party]] in 1980.

Candido married Gilda de Melo e Sousa in 1943, a Brazilian essayist and fellow professor at the University of São Paulo, with whom he has three daughters.

Candido was hospitalized at [[Albert Einstein Hospital]] in [[São Paulo]] days before his death on May 12, 2017 due to a [[hiatus hernia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/culture/2017/05/1883413-brazilian-literary-critic-and-sociologist-antonio-candido-dies-in-sao-paulo-at-age-98.shtml|title=Brazilian Literary Critic and Sociologist Antonio Candido Dies in São Paulo at Age 98|last=Rizzo|first=Sergio|date=May 12, 2017|website=Folha de S.Paulo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 98.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cartacapital.com.br/cultura/um-radical-de-ocasiao-antonio-candido-morre-aos-98-anos|title=Um "radical de ocasião": Antonio Candido morre aos 98 anos|last=Martins|first=Miguel|date=May 12, 2017|work=CartaCapital|access-date=May 12, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Archaeological Park of Urbs Salvia ''' is situated in the ''[[comune]]'' of [[Urbisaglia]]  ([[Province of Macerata]]), in the [[Marche]]s, Italy. It is the largest archaeological park in the region.

== History ==
[[File:Umbria et Picenum.JPG|thumb|''Regio V Picenum'' et ''VI Umbria'']]The city, located in the [[Picenum|V Regio Picenum]], was founded as a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' during the 2nd century BC. &lt;br /&gt;
It was the birthplace of some leading figures of the Roman Empire, such as the consul [[Gaius Fufius Geminus (consul 29)|Gaius Fufius Geminus]] and [[Lucius Flavius Silva|Lucius Flavius Silva Nonius Bassus]]. 
Urbs Salvia was sacked by the [[Visigoths]]  in 408-10 AD, and suffered destruction over the years from earthquakes and plundering.&lt;br /&gt;
The decadence of the town is described by the poet [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321) in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (Paradiso, XVI, 73-78):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If Luni thou regard, and Urbisaglia,&lt;br /&gt;
How they have passed away, and how are passing&lt;br /&gt;
Chiusi and Senigallia after them,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To hear how races waste themselves away&lt;br /&gt;
Will seem to thee no novel thing nor hard&lt;br /&gt;
Seeing that even cities have an end.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Archaeological Park ==
The Archaeological Park of Urbs Salvia is exceptional on account of the ease with which the overall building plan can be deciphered. &lt;br /&gt;
The itinerary starts at the Archaeological Museum which houses, among other things, epigraphs, statues and portraits that were excavated in Urbisaglia from the middle of the 18th century onwards.

===Reservoir===
Just outside the medieval city walls, on the highest point of the site, you can find the large '''reservoir''' collecting and cleaning the water coming from the Roman Aqueduct of Urbs Salvia. [[File:Cistern.jpg|thumb|Reservoir, Urbs Salvia]]It was formed by an underground vaulted conduit with lateral walls made of bricks ([[opus latericium]]). The ancient aqueduct ran under the top of this hill and was about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km long. It had a gentle and constant slope so that it could carry water from a spring situated at the opposite side of the present-day Urbisaglia into this structure. &lt;br /&gt;
The cisterns consist of two barrel vaulted tunnels connected at both ends, with internal walls covered by hydraulic mortar. The whole structure was built in [[opus caementicium]] (Roman mortar).
Each tunnel was about 51 m long,  2.90 m wide and 4.10 m high and had a capacity of about 1,000 cubic metres of water.&lt;br /&gt;
The reservoir provided the whole town with spring water and it was situated in the highest area inside Urbs Salvia so that it could be powered only by gravity. In the reservoir are still visible:
* the water outlet: the opening through which water was distributed to the town. The pipes (fistulae) were made of lead;
* the ventilation shafts (lumina): a series of openings in the vault for air exchange, check of level and quality of water and periodical maintenance (manual cleaning of the internal walls);
* the water inlet: whence water flowed inside. It is formed by one of the ends of the aqueduct and shows a very thick layer of water deposit (calcium carbonate);
* traces of the planks utilized to build the vaults are still visible at some parts.

===From the theater to the amphitheater===
[[File:Urbs Salvia Theatre1.jpg|thumb|Roman theatre of Urbs Salvia]]
[[File:Urbs Salvia Theatre2.jpg|thumb|left|Roman theatre of Urbs Salvia]]
Proceeding downwards there is the imposing Roman '''[[Roman theatre (structure)|Theatre]]''', built in 23 AD, on the Hellenic model. The structure presents a ''cavea'' (auditorium) divided into three tiers of seats with entrances on the different levels. Around the cavea there is a corridor with steps running to the top, where there was a ''sacellum'' (small temple). Of the original stage the lower part of the walling is preserved; behind the stage, there is an artificial terrace which was framed by a colonnade supported by solid brick walling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Urbs Salvia Theatre.jpg|thumb|Roman theatre of Urbs Salvia]]
Lower down is a '''niched building''', a containment wall which is to be included in the whole urban context pivoting on an axis characterized by the Theatre – Forum – Temple.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the foot of the hill, conveniently placed alongside the [[via Salaria Gallica|Salaria Gallica]] (i.e. the main line of communication in the [[Picenum]], here matching up with the [[Cardo Maximus]] of the town), was the '''sanctuary-complex'''. &lt;br /&gt;
The main temple had a six-column facade. What remains of the original structure is part of the podium lacking the white limestone slabs with which it was originally paved. It was dedicated to the [[Salus Augusta]] (protector goddess of the Emperor), and was probably used for the imperial cult promoted by [[Tiberius]], successor of [[Augustus]]. The temple is enclosed by a porticus made up of four underground galleries with frescoes in the 3rd Pompeiian style. The frescoes represent haunting animals, masks, and pictures connected with Augustus' political propaganda ([[tropaion|trophies]]).&lt;br /&gt;
Next to the main temple there is a smaller one. Behind it there is an area which was probably devoted to the ritual use of water, and behind the main temple there is a [[Roman roads|via munita]], corresponding to the first East [[cardo]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Anfiteatro Urbs Salvia2.jpg|thumb|left|Roman Amphiteatre of Urbs Salvia]]
[[File:Anfiteatro Urbs Salvia.jpg|thumb|Roman Amphiteatre of Urbs Salvia]]
Just outside the '''city walls''', there are two '''funeral monuments''' and the '''[[Roman amphitheatre|Amphitheatre]]''', one of the best preserved examples of this type in the Marche region. &lt;br /&gt;
The amphitheatre was built after the year 81 AD by the Urbisalvian [[Titus]]' military general [[Lucius Flavius Silva|Lucius Flavius Silva Nonius Bassus]], who captured the [[Masada]] fortress in Palestine. The amphitheatre was used for gladiatorial contests and other entertainments. All its perimeter is preserved up to the first seating level, including the first level of the vomitoria (the exit-ways) and the bases of the pillars of the external corridor. In its original form it probably had three tiers of seats. The external wall of the ''cavea'' (auditorium) had a series of semicircular niches which later formed the supports of the stairs to the entrances on the upper floors. &lt;br /&gt;
The arena is 59m long and 35m wide. The two entrances at the major axis of the elliptical amphitheatre were for the [[gladiator]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33630">The '''Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies (ACMRS)''' is a statewide research unit in [[Arizona]] charged with coordinating and stimulating the interdisciplinary exploration of [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] culture. Its activities cover a period roughly from 400 C.E., the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], to 1700 C.E. ACMRS organizes programs at [[Northern Arizona University]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], and the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson]].[[File:ASU Main - Coor SEC - 2009-01-30.jpg|thumb|ASU Main - Coor SEC - 2009-01-30]]

ACMRS is a tri-university research unit within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Clas) at [[Arizona State University]] (ASU).  ACMRS was established in 1981 by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]] for the purpose of promoting and coordinating all aspects of Medieval and Renaissance Studies at all three state universities through the support of research, lectures, symposia, conferences, visiting professorships, and publications.  It cooperates with the Medieval and Renaissance Committees (MARC) of Northern Arizona University (NAU) and the [[University of Arizona]] (UA) to promote similar scholarly activity at ASU's sister universities.

== History of ACMRS ==

=== Directors ===
From 1982 until 1994, ACMRS was directed by Jean R. Brink from the Department of English at ASU. It is currently directed by Robert E. Bjork, also from the Department of English at ASU.

=== 1981-1987 ===
In establishing ACMRS, ASU employed Professor Fredi Chiappelli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fredi Chiappelli Memorial Fellowship for 2011-12|url=http://www.cmrs.ucla.edu/awards/chiappelli_fellows.html|work=UCLA Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  then Director of the [[UCLA Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies]], as a consultant. Because he directed an internationally recognized center and had previously served as a visiting professor at the [[University of Arizona]] and as a visiting lecturer at [[Northern Arizona University]] and was therefore familiar with the Arizona universities, his participation in the founding of the Center was viewed as essential. The founding document approved by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]] (ABOR) in 1981 indicated the following provisions: ACMRS was to be located at ASU; a Director with an indefinite term was to be appointed; a steering committee composed of three scholars from each university, and other such detailed specifications.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Accessed in: ACMRS Sunset Review: 1994-1999, pages 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1987-1993 ===
During the next stage in ACMRS history, continued lack of funding made it more and more difficult to maintain a statewide network. Communication by telephone and electronic mail continued to flourish, and some cooperation among faculty continued independently of a formal structure as well as through ACMRS. Local campus operations at the three universities, however, began to perform many of the functions originally envisioned for a statewide Center. Because of a statewide budgetary crisis, ACMRS was asked in the spring of 1993 to cut $50,000 from its budget. In response to that request some operating reductions were made, and some activities discontinued completely. The Center in this period had two full-time staff and several graduate student assistants besides the Director. The main activities included a lecture series, hosting the national conferences of the Sixteenth-Century Studies Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sixteenth Century Society and Conference|url=http://www.sixteenthcentury.org/|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Renaissance Society of America]], and a Distinguished Visiting Professor program.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=== 1994-1999 ===
In July 1994, Robert E. Bjork&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Bjork|url=https://webapp4.asu.edu/directory/person/15493|work=Arizona State University|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed Director of ACMRS. Since his appointment, in addition to continuing programs already established such as an ad hoc lecture series, a graduate student travel award to the Medieval Congress at [[Western Michigan University]] in [[Kalamazoo]], and a book award for promising undergraduates intending to do post-graduate work in medieval or Renaissance studies, Bjork instituted over twenty programs or initiatives that changed the structure of ACMRS, lent it more national and international prominence, and reinvigorated cooperation among Arizona's three universities. Chief among these new programs was the inauguration of the annual interdisciplinary conference in 1995 and the institution of ''MRTS'' (''Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies''&lt;ref name=mrts&gt;{{cite web|title=Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies|url=http://acmrs.org/publications/mrts|work=ACMRS|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at ACMRS in 1996, a prestigious publication initiated at [[Binghamton University]]. As a result of all the programmatic changes instituted during this period, the ACMRS staff grew to five full-time staff personnel. By 1999, ACMRS had several well-established publishing programs besides ''MRTS'', and a much stronger local, national, and international presence than it had in the past.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=== 1999-2002 ===
ACMRS’s local, regional, national, and international standing continued to rise during this period; new programs and initiatives were put into place; and external and internal funding continued to grow. Grant writing both externally and internally, for example, increased to an average of sixteen proposals per year; and manuscript submissions to the Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies&lt;ref name="mrts" /&gt; (MRTS) series continued to flow in.   In the spring of 1999, Bjork inaugurated the lecture series “Distinguished Lectures in Medieval and Renaissance Studies”&lt;ref name=dl&gt;{{cite web|title=ACMRS Distinguished Lecture Series in Medieval and Renaissance Studies|url=http://acmrs.org/public-programs/distinguished-lecture-series|work=ACMRS|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over the course of that year entered into new joint publication ventures in the U.S. and abroad, established new book series, and continually increased cooperation between ASU, UA and NAU. Outreach programs likewise remained strong and internationally included joint meetings of the ACMRS conference with that of the [[Medieval Academy of America]] in 2001 that attracted 367 attendees from 12 countries and with that of the [[Renaissance Society of America]] in spring 2002 that attracted approximately 730 attendees worldwide.  Since the acquisition of MRTS in 1996, ACMRS saved [[ASU College of Liberal Arts and Sciences]] an average of $7,224 per year in its salary commitment to ACMRS for the series and, because of that commitment, generated an average of $20,000 per year in grant support and $15,500 in additional salaries.&lt;ref name=sunset2002&gt;Accessed in: ACMRS Sunset Review: 2002-2007, pages 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2002-2007 ===
In 2002-3, ACMRS began to distribute the publications of the [[Viking Society for Northern Research]] at the [[University of London]], the Istituto storico italiano per il Medio Evo in [[Rome]], and Roma nel Rinascimento also in [[Rome]]; it also successfully negotiated with AMS Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMS Press,Inc.|url=http://www.amspressinc.com/|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the publication of the annual journal ''Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Studies in Medieval and  Renaissance History|url=http://www.amspressinc.com/smrh.html|work=AMS Press, Inc.|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biannual meeting of the International Society of Anglo-Saxonists,&lt;ref name=isas&gt;{{cite web|title=International Society of Anglo-Saxonists|url=http://www.isas.us/|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which Director Bjork was president, came to Arizona then. In 2003-4, the ACMRS director negotiated agreements with the Medieval Studies Program at [[Pennsylvania State University]] and with the International Society of Anglo-Saxonists to publish series of their books and with [[Brepols]] to have another book series ''Late Medieval and Early Modern Studies'' produced under ACMRS’s auspices and the auspices of the [[University of Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="lmems" /&gt; These agreements were designed to embed ACMRS in the world community of medieval and Renaissance scholars and to foster international cooperation. And to gauge how successful ACMRS was becoming in funding its own programs, the Director conducted an informal survey of all medieval and Renaissance studies centers in [[North America]], inquiring about what percentage of their annual budgets they managed to cover from their own funds and what percentage was covered by their universities.  He discovered that as of March, 2003, ACMRS ranks first in this category, its closest competitor being the Medieval Institute at [[Western Michigan University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Medieval Institute|url=http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/|work=Western Michigan University|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which hosts the largest medieval conference in the world every year and covers approximately 50% of its own budget. Beginning in 2007, ACMRS negotiated an agreement with the [[University of Maryland]], College Park, to co-publish the journal ''Early Modern Women'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Modern Women: An Interdisciplinary Journal|url=http://www.emwjournal.umd.edu/index.shtml|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it began a new subseries within MRTS called FRETS, ''French of England Texts and Studies''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The French of England|url=http://www.fordham.edu/academics/programs_at_fordham_/medieval_studies/french_of_england/index.asp|work=Fordham University|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Fordham University]] and [[York University]]; and it became the joint sponsor with the Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship of MEDFEM-L (medieval feminist listserv).&lt;ref name=smfs&gt;{{cite web|title=Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship|url=http://smfsweb.org/|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Last, the director served on the inaugural standing committee of CARMEN, Co-operative for the Advancement of Research through a Medieval European Network, a European organization whose main purpose is to generate ideas and institutional teams for major funding proposals to agencies in Europe such as the European Science Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CARMEN: The Worldwide Medieval Network|url=http://www.carmen-medieval.net/|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the second meeting of CARMEN, held this time in [[Prato, Italy]], Bjork also began negotiations for collaborative efforts between ACMRS and the developing Prato Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies of [[Monash University]] in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="sunset2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prato Consortium for Medieval and Renaissance Studies|url=http://www.medren.ed.ac.uk/pratoconsortium.html|work=Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies|publisher=The University of Edinburgh|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Biesdorf Palace''' ({{lang-de|Schloss Biesdorf}}) is a [[Neoclassical Architecture|Neoclassical]]-style building in [[Marzahn-Hellersdorf]], [[Berlin]]. Constructed in 1868, [[Werner von Siemens]] acquired the palace in 1887. However, in 1889 he handed the building over to his son, [[Georg Wilhelm von Siemens]]. Damaged in [[World War II]], the building was reconstructed on the basis of its original appearance, with the work being completed in 2016.

'''''Broad City''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] television sitcom, created by and starring [[Ilana Glazer]] and [[Abbi Jacobson]].

==Cast==
===Main cast===
[[File:Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer at Internet Week 11.jpg|thumb|Jacobson (left) and Glazer (right) at Internet Week New York in May 2015.]]
* [[Abbi Jacobson]] as Abbalah "Abbi" Abrams,&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Jews on a Plane' script|url=http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=108&amp;t=26750}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was born in 1988&lt;!--she celebrates her 26th birthday during s1 e10--&gt; and is from the [[Philadelphia Main Line]]. Like her best friend Ilana, she enjoys smoking [[marijuana]], albeit less often. During the first season and most of the second, Abbi works as a cleaner at a fitness center called Soulstice (a [[parody]] of, and named for [[Equinox Fitness|Equinox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/broad-city-parody-on-the-nyc-fitness-scene-is-perfect/|title=''Broad City’s'' parodied take on the NYC fitness scene is really perfect|date=2 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SoulCycle]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jessica-goodman/broad-city-best-new-show_b_4776073.html|title=The Best New Show You're Not Watching|first1=Jessica Goodman Entertainment|last1=Editor|first2=The Huffington|last2=Post|date=12 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is promoted to trainer and begins teaching fitness classes for senior citizens. She is also a struggling illustrator who dreams of quitting Soulstice to pursue art full-time. Abbi endeavors to find a balance between being a responsible, self-sufficient adult while being fun-loving and free-spirited like Ilana. She lives in [[Astoria, Queens]]&lt;ref&gt;''s3 e7''&lt;/ref&gt; and has a roommate, Melody, who is [[unseen character|never seen]]. Melody's [[freeloading]] boyfriend Matt, called by his last name "Bevers", spends most of his time at Abbi and Melody's apartment. Abbi has a huge crush on her neighbor Jeremy, but manages to embarrass herself every time she is around him. They eventually [[have sex]], but break up soon after Abbi accidentally melts his [[strap-on dildo]]. In season 3, she has sex with her boss Trey, then later go on a date, but she attempts to keep it a secret out of embarrassment. Abbi is the more level-headed of the two friends, but can lose her head when intoxicated or participating in competition.

* [[Ilana Glazer]] as Ilana Wexler,&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic1" /&gt; who was born in 1992&lt;!--she celebrates her 23rd birthday during s2 e10--&gt; and is a [[New York University]] graduate from [[Long Island]]. She is an [[extravert]]ed [[slacker]] and marijuana enthusiast who is often oblivious to how others react to her self-absorbed antics. For the majority of the series, Ilana works at a nondescript sales company called Deals Deals Deals, but rarely does any work and often takes breaks lasting hours. She is disdained by her coworkers because of her lazy attitude, but her passive boss Todd keeps her employed due to his submissiveness. She is finally fired after posting the [[Zoophilia|bestiality]] video "[[Enumclaw horse sex case|Mr. Hands]]" on the company's [[Twitter]] account. She shares an apartment with [[gay]] Guatemalan [[immigration to the United States|immigrant]] Jaimé, and has an ongoing sexual relationship with Lincoln, a mild-mannered dentist. Ilana regards their relationship as "purely physical," much to Lincoln's dismay, although she often exhibits genuine caring for him. Compared to her best friend Abbi, she is more free-spirited, sexually liberated and much more bold and confident. However, every escapade has unintended consequences—which usually impact Abbi, who is reluctantly dragged into Ilana's schemes.

===Recurring cast===
* [[Hannibal Buress]] as Lincoln Rice, [[Dental degree|DDS]] – a successful pediatric dentist with whom Ilana has a [[casual sexual relationship]]. He has romantic feelings for Ilana and wants to take their relationship further, but Ilana, who is afraid of commitment, wants to remain sex buddies. He is a funny, easygoing guy and often plays games and tells jokes with his patients. He is also a loyal friend to Abbi. In Season 3, he decides that in order to be [[monogamous]] with his new girlfriend Stephanie, he can no longer have sex with Ilana, and does not feel they can be friends either. In Season 4, Ilana and a newly single Lincoln decide to try being in a serious relationship for at least a year. After that they will check in with each other to see if they wish to continue the relationship.
* [[Paul W. Downs]] as Trey Pucker – Abbi's boss at Soulstice. He is a genuinely nice guy and a hardcore health and fitness enthusiast. When he was 18, he made homemade masturbation videos under the name "Kirk Steele". For the majority of the series, he was oblivious to Abbi's desire to be a trainer and badgered her to clean things around the gym. Abbi and Trey began dating in Season 3, although Abbi attempted to keep it a secret out of embarrassment and left him humiliated when he heard her describe him to Ilana as a "joke" and a "[[guilty pleasure]]." 
* [[John Gemberling]] as Matt Bevers – Abbi's (never-seen) roommate Melody's boyfriend who rarely leaves. He is a messy, lazy, obese freeloader who eats Abbi's food and lives in her apartment rent-free. In spite of this, he has been shown to have a sweet, sensitive side. He is oblivious to Abbi's disdain for him and considers them to be best friends. The Season 4 premiere revealed that when he met Abbi, he was unselfish and in good shape, and implied that his gross ways came about because Abbi unwittingly encouraged him to be that way.
* [[Arturo Castro (Guatemalan actor)|Arturo Castro]] as Jaimé Castro – Ilana's gay drug-dealing roommate. Jaimé is a Guatemalan immigrant. He becomes an American citizen in Season 2. He and Ilana were in a relationship back in 2011 when they were both students at NYU.
* [[Stephen Schneider (actor)|Stephen Schneider]] as Jeremy Santos – Abbi's across-the-hall neighbor, on whom she has a big crush; he is polite and easy-going, but his mere presence reduces Abbi to nervous, regrettable behavior. Abbi and Jeremy eventually have sex, but break up after she ruins his custom strap-on dildo and can't find a suitable replacement.
* [[Chris Gethard]] as Todd – Ilana's former boss at fictional web "deal" company Deals! Deals! Deals! He was generally submissive and ineffective at attempting to curb Ilana's lack of commitment to the job, but finally got the nerve to get rid of her for good in Season 3.
* Nicole Drespel as Nicole – Ilana's former co-worker, a serious worker who disdains Ilana and secretly documented her offensive activities in the office.
* Eliot Glazer as Eliot – Ilana's gay brother who got a promotion at work requiring him to move to London, England. The actor is Ilana's brother in real life.
* [[Susie Essman]] as Bobbi Wexler – Ilana and Eliot's mother who lives on Long Island and loves high quality knock-off handbags.
* [[Bob Balaban]] as Arthur Wexler – Ilana and Eliot's father who lives on Long Island.

==Production==
Glazer and Jacobson met when they both attended courses at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]]. In February 2010 they started their own web series on [[YouTube]], which proved popular. [[Amy Poehler]] became aware of the series and mentored Glazer and Jacobson, becoming executive producer when the show came to TV. When Glazer and Jacobson wrote the pilot script, their characters were named Evelyn Wexler and Carly Abrams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-calling.com/scripts/TV_Comedies/Broad_City_1x01.pdf|title=Pilot episode script|accessdate=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, but ended up using their real first names instead. The pair continued writing most of the episodes together, with approximately half of the episodes to date bearing their names as writers.

[[Paul W. Downs]], who produces and stars as Trey, has written several episodes on the series with [[Lucia Aniello]], who has also produced and directed episodes on the series. Paul has written "Working Girls" (episode 1.3), "Knockoffs" (episode 2.4) and "Coat Check" (episode 2.9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/arts/television/the-secret-weapons-of-broad-city-makefine-art-fromcrude-humor.html?_r=0|title=The Secret Weapons of ‘Broad City’ Make Fine Art From Crude Humor|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|first=Joy|last=Press|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic Megan Angelo quotes Abbi Jacobson, main star of Comedy Central's ''Broad City'': "If you watch one of our episodes, there’s not a big message, but if you watch all of them, I think, they’re empowering to women.”&lt;ref name="Angelo 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Angelo|first=Megan|title=The Sneak-Attack Feminism of ‘Broad City’ |website=Wall Street Journal|date=14 February 2011|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/02/14/the-sneak-attack-feminism-of-broad-city/|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V.

Season 3 received positive reviews as well, with Metacritic giving it a score of 87 out of 100, based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating "universal acclaim." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/broad-city/season-3|title=Broad City|work=Metacritic|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ben Travers from Indiewire summarizes what he sees as the strengths of the first two episodes of season 3: "Each half hour feels as free-wheeling and wild as Ilana so boldly is, but also as meticulously put-together as Abby [sic] strives to be...the integration of its two creators attitudes into the core makeup of the series helps to illustrate how groundbreaking ''Broad City'' really is." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/review-broad-city-season-3-prevails-as-a-singular-and-innovative-comedy-of-the-now-20160216|title=Review: 'Broad City' Season 3 Prevails as a Singular and Innovative Comedy of the Now|date=14 January 2015|work=rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US_Employment_Statistics_from_FRED_Database_-_v1.png|thumb|right|250px|Employment statistics from the FRED database, comparing September 2014 and October 2009. Many of the mathematical relationships between the variables are shown.]]

The data series can be obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED). As of September 2014, there were 248,446,000 persons in the civilian noninstitutional population &lt;ref&gt;[http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CNP16OV Federal Reserve Economic Database FRED - Civilian Noninstitutional Population - Retrieved October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; out of a U.S. population of approximately 320 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/POP Federal Reserve Economic Database FRED - Total Population Including All Ages and Armed Forces Overseas-Retrieved October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; It has steadily grown along with the U.S. population, roughly 1% per year for 2005-2013 period.

==Usage==
The measure is used to help gauge the percentage of the population that is employed or in the workforce, as the denominator in the "civilian employment to population ratio", also called the EM ratio,&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EMRATIO Federal Reserve Economic Database-FRED-EMRATIO-Retrieved October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and the "civilian labor force participation rate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CIVPART Federal Reserve Economic Database-FRED-CIVPART-Retrieved October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Trends in these figures are shown in the first graphic; the computation of these figures is shown in the second graphic.

The '''cohort model''' in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[neurolinguistics]] is a model of lexical retrieval first proposed by William Marslen-Wilson in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Packard, 287.&lt;/ref&gt;  It attempts to describe how visual or auditory input (i.e., hearing or reading a word) is mapped onto a word in a hearer's [[lexicon]].  According to the model, when a person hears speech segments real-time, each speech segment "activates" every word in the lexicon that begins with that segment, and as more segments are added, more words are ruled out, until only one word is left that still matches the input.

==Background Information==
The cohort model relies on a number of concepts in the theory of lexical retrieval. The [[lexicon]] is the store of words in a person's mind.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mental+lexicon], The Free Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; it contains a person's vocabulary and is similar to a mental dictionary. A [[lexical item|lexical entry]] is all the information about a word and the lexical storage is the way the items are stored for peak retrieval. Lexical access is the way that an individual accesses the information in the mental lexicon. A word's cohort is composed of all the lexical items that share an initial sequence of phonemes.,&lt;ref&gt;^ Fernandez, E.M. &amp; Smith Cairns, H. (2011). Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics (Malden, MZ: Wiley-Blackwell). {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9147-0}} (&lt;/ref&gt; and is the set of words activated by the initial phonemes of the word.

==Model==
The cohort model is based on the concept that auditory or visual input to the brain stimulates [[neuron]]s as it enters the brain, rather than at the end of a word.&lt;ref&gt;Altmann, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  This fact was demonstrated in the 1980s through experiments with [[speech shadowing]], in which subjects listened to recordings and were instructed to repeat aloud exactly what they heard, as quickly as possible; Marslen-Wilson found that the subjects often started to repeat a word before it had actually finished playing, which suggested that the word in the hearer's lexicon was activated before the entire word had been heard.&lt;ref name="altmann70"&gt;Altmann, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Findings such as these led Marslen-Wilson to propose the cohort model in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Marslen-Wilson, W. (1987). "Functional parallelism in spoken word recognition." ''Cognition'', 25, 71-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cohort model consists of three stages: access, selection, and integration.&lt;ref name="Gaskell 1997 613–656"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaskell|first=M. Gareth|author2=William D. Marslen-Wilson|title=Integrating Form and Meaning: A Distributed Model of Speech Perception|journal=Language and Cognitive Processes|year=1997|volume=12|issue=5/6|pages=613–656|url=https://docs.google.com/a/virginia.edu/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:e4UnfkwbulEJ:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi%3D10.1.1.133.303%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESidz3RezMAk_Gbu6oN8Ngfc6NEWN08lUng3NzoaCI7xJ_qdpWwcxO-_y_dpcPVDYyo0w4mcdkaFhj3EyCXT07rcIBxwhWIZdlqXuoqdaG5rbPAKyZQnT71SVAxlI-PpMzgmqV2G&amp;sig=AHIEtbRCkFf47KQqIzNAM_Wqr3jyVs3sDQ|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this model, auditory lexical retrieval begins with the first one or two speech segments, or [[phoneme]]s, reach the hearer's ear, at which time the mental lexicon activates every possible word that begins with that speech segment.&lt;ref name="packard288"&gt;Packard, 288.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs during the "access stage" and all of the possible words are known as the cohort.&lt;ref name=harley&gt;HARLEY, T. A. (2009). Psychology of language, from data to theory. New York: Psychology Pr.&lt;/ref&gt; The words that are activated by the speech signal but are not the intended word are often called "competitors."&lt;ref name="ibrahim"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.linguistics-journal.com/August_2008_ri.php | title=Does Visual and Auditory Word Perception have a Language-Selective Input?

These processes continue until an instant, called the ''recognition point'',&lt;ref name="packard288"/&gt; at which only one word remains activated and all competitors have been kicked out. The recognition point process is initiated within the first 200 to 250 milliseconds of the onset of the given word.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, E.M. &amp; Smith Cairns, H. (2011). Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics (Malden, MZ: Wiley-Blackwell). {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9147-0}} (&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also known as the uniqueness point and it is the point where the most processing occurs.&lt;ref name=harley /&gt; Moreover, there is a difference in the way a word is processed before it reaches its recognition point and afterwards. One can look at the process prior to reaching the recognition point as bottom-up, where the phonemes are used to access the lexicon. The post recognition point process is top-down, because the information concerning the chosen word is tested against the word that is presented.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, M., &amp; Hambly, G. (1986). Exploring the cohort model of spoken word recognition. Cognition, 22(3), 259-282.
&lt;/ref&gt; The selection stage occurs when only one word is left from the set.&lt;ref name=harley /&gt; Finally, in the integration stage, the semantic and syntactic properties of activated words are incorporated into the high-level utterance representation.&lt;ref name="Gaskell 1997 613–656"/&gt;

[[File:Candle cohort.JPG|thumb|Increasing segments of the word, "candle"]]For example, in the auditory recognition of the word "candle," the following steps take place. When the hearer hears the first two phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/æ/}} ((1) and (2) in the image), he or she would activate the word "candle," along with competitors such as "candy," "can," "cattle," and numerous others.  Once the phoneme {{IPA|/n/}} is added ((3) in the image), "cattle" would be kicked out; with {{IPA|/d/}}, "can" would be kicked out; and this process would continue until the recognition point, the final {{IPA|/l/}} of "candle," were reached ((5) in the image).&lt;ref name="brysbaert"&gt;Brysbaert, Marc, and Ton Dijkstra (2006). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20061003140303/http://www.pc.rhul.ac.uk/staff/M.Brysbaert/marcbrysPDF/Changing%20views%20on%20word%20recognition%20in%20bilinguals.doc Changing views on word recognition in bilinguals]." in ''Bilingualism and second language acquisition'', eds. Morais, J. &amp; d’Ydewalle, G.  Brussels: KVAB.&lt;/ref&gt;  The recognition point need not always be the final phoneme of the word; the recognition point of "slander," for example, occurs at the {{IPA|/d/}} (since no other English words begin "sland-");&lt;ref name="altmann70"/&gt; all competitors for "spaghetti" are ruled out as early as {{IPA|/spəɡ/}};&lt;ref name="brysbaert"/&gt; [[Jerome Packard]] has demonstrated that the recognition point of the [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese]] word ''huŏchē'' ("train") occurs before ''huŏch-'';&lt;ref&gt;Packard, 289.&lt;/ref&gt; and a landmark study by Pienie Zwitserlood demonstrated that the recognition point of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''kapitein'' (captain) was at the vowel before the final {{IPA|/n/}}.&lt;ref name="altmann72"&gt;Altmann, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its original proposal, the model has been adjusted to allow for the role that [[Context (language use)|context]] plays in helping the hearer rule out competitors,&lt;ref name="packard288"/&gt; and the fact that activation is "tolerant" to minor acoustic mismatches that arise because of [[Assimilation (linguistics)|coarticulation]] (a property by which language sounds are slightly changed by the sounds preceding and following them).&lt;ref&gt;Altmann, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental evidence==
Much evidence in favor of the cohort model has come from [[Priming (psychology)|priming studies]], in which a "priming word" is presented to a subject and then closely followed by a "target word" and the subject asked to identify if the target word is a real word or not; the theory behind the priming paradigm is that if a word is activated in the subject's mental lexicon, the subject will be able to respond more quickly to the target word.&lt;ref&gt;Packard, 295.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the subject does respond more quickly, the target word is said to be "primed" by the priming word.  Several priming studies have found that when a stimulus that does not reach recognition point is presented, numerous words targets were all primed, whereas if a stimulus past recognition point is presented, only one word is primed. For example, in Pienie Zwitserlood's study of Dutch compared the words ''kapitein'' ("captain") and ''kapitaal'' ("capital" or "money"); in the study, the stem ''kapit-'' primed both ''boot'' ("boat," semantically related to ''kapitein'') and ''geld'' ("money," semantically related to ''kapitaal''), suggesting that both lexical entries were activated; the full word ''kapitein'', on the other hand, primed only ''boot'' and not ''geld''.&lt;ref name="altmann72"/&gt; Furthermore, experiments have shown that in tasks where subjects must differentiate between words and non-words, reaction times were faster for longer words with phonemic points of discrimination earlier in the word. For example, discriminating between ''Crocodile'' and ''Dial'', the point of recognition to discriminate between the two words comes at the /d/ in ''crocodile'' which is much earlier than the /l/ sound in ''Dial''.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later experiments refined the model.  For example, some studies showed that "shadowers" (subjects who listen to auditory stimuli and repeat it as quickly as possible) could not shadow as quickly when words were jumbled up so they didn't mean anything; those results suggested that sentence structure and speech context also contribute to the process of activation and selection.&lt;ref name="altmann70"/&gt;

Research in bilinguals has found that word recognition is influenced by the number of neighbors in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;Van Heuven, W.J.B., Dijkstra, T., &amp; Grainger, J. (1998). "Orthographic Neighborhood Effects in Bilingual Word Recognition." Journal of Memory and Language. pp. 458-483.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creolistics''', or '''Creology''', is the [[scientific]] study of [[creole language]]s and, as such, is a subfield of [[linguistics]]. Someone who engages in this study is called a '''creolist'''.

==Controversy==
Creolistics investigates the relative creoleness of languages suspected to be [[creole (language)|creole]]s, what {{Harvcoltxt|Schneider|1990}} calls "the [[cline (linguistics)|cline]] of creoleness."  No consensus exists among creolists as to whether the nature of creoleness is [[prototypical]] or merely evidence indicative of a set of recognizable phenomena seen in association with little inherent unity and no underlying single cause.

==="Creole", a sociohistoric concept===
''Creoleness'' is at the heart of the controversy with [[John McWhorter]]&lt;ref&gt;As in {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mikael Parkvall{{sfnp|Parkvall|2001}} opposing [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and [[Michel DeGraff]].&lt;ref&gt;As in {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2003}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In McWhorter's definition, creoleness is a matter of degree, in that prototypical creoles exhibit all of the three traits he proposes to diagnose creoleness: little or no [[inflection]], little or no [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparent]] [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]; In McWhorter's view, less prototypical creoles depart somewhat from this [[prototype]]. Along these lines, McWhorter defines [[Haitian Creole]], exhibiting all three traits, as "the most creole of creoles."{{sfnp|McWhorter|1998|p=809}} A creole like [[Palenquero]], on the other hand, would be less prototypical, given the presence of inflection to mark plural, past, gerund, and participle forms.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2000}} Objections to the McWhorter-Parkvall hypotheses point out that these typological [[parameters]] of creoleness can be found in languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Sooninke]], and [[Magoua]] [[French language|French]] which are not considered creoles. Wittmann and DeGraff come to the conclusion that efforts to conceive a [[yardstick]] for measuring [[creoleness]] in any scientifically meaningful way have failed so far.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1999}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2003}} {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} comes to the same conclusion for [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}} have adduced evidence as to creole languages which respond unexpectedly to one of McWhorter's three features (for example, [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]]). {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|2001}} have argued further that Creole languages are structurally no different from any other language, and that Creole is in fact a sociohistoric concept (and not a linguistic one), encompassing displaced population and slavery. {{Harvcoltxt|DeGraff|Walicek|2005}} discuss creolistics in relation to [[colonialism|colonialist]] ideologies, rejecting the notion that Creoles can be responsibly defined in terms of specific grammatical characteristics. They discuss the history of linguistics and nineteenth-century work that argues for the consideration of the sociohistorical contexts in which Creole languages emerged.

==="Creole", a genuine linguistic concept===
On the other hand, McWhorter points out that in languages such as Bambara, essentially a dialect of Manding, there is ample non-transparent derivation, and that there is no reason to suppose that this would be absent in close relatives such as Mandinka itself.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|p=16}} Moreover, he also observes that Soninke has what all linguists would analyze as inflections, and that current lexicography of Soninke is too elementary for it to be stated with authority that it does not have non-transparent derivation.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|pp=35, 369}} Meanwhile, Magoua French, as described by Henri Wittmann, retains some indication of grammatical gender, which qualifies as inflection, and it also retains non-transparent derivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1996}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}} as interpreted by {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Michel DeGraff's argument has been that Haitian Creole retains non-transparent derivation from French.

To the defense of DeGraff and Wittmann it must be said that McWhorter's 2005 book is a collection of previously published papers and that it contains nothing on "defining creole", Manding, Sooninke or Magoua that wasn't already known when DeGraff and Wittmann published their critiques as can be seen from their published debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R6278&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133249/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R6278&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R12834&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133212/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R12834&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R14907&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133219/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R14907&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R20843&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133224/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R20843&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R21590&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133229/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R21590&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R4629&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133259/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R4629&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} Also see the list at the end of [http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As it is, McWhorter's book does not offer anything new by the way of analysis of Manding, Soninke, or Magoua that wasn't already debated on in his exchange with Wittmann on Creolist. The issues in question are, at this point, unresolved as to sustaining McWhorter's hypotheses in any significant way though DeGraff's 2005 contribution addresses their weaknesses as far as Haitian Creole is concerned adding new evidence against. The only conclusion possibly so far as the typological differences between Manding, Soninke, Magoua and Haitian are concerned is that their comparative data do not confirm McWhorter's yardstick approach to defining creole.

===Proposed synthesis===
The answer might be that creoleness is better described and referred to as a syndrome. In some cases, the modified source language might be the [[substratum|substrate]] language when warranted by a [[homogeneous]] substrate.{{sfnp|Singler|1988}} In other cases, the modified source language clearly is what [[creolist]]s identify as the [[superstrate]] language'{{sfnp|Wittmann|2001}} and in still other cases, no single source language might be identifiable.{{sfnp|DeGraff|2001}}  The same approach must be applied to identifying individual features as inherited or non-inherited and to distilling the defining grounds which separate creole languages from [[mixed language]]s such as [[Michif]], especially when [[relexification]] is somehow claimed to be a moving factor.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1973}}{{sfnp|Singler|1996}}{{sfnp|Wittmann|Fournier|1996}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2002}}

The answer might also be, however, that creole languages (i.e. like Haitian Creole) are indeed a unique in terms of the perspective that they offer on the human language competence in terms of the nature of their grammars though there have been no new responses to the counter-claims of DeGraff and Wittmann that would warrant the reopening of the debate as for now. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|Lim|2007}} critically assesses the proposal that creole languages exist as a homogeneous structural type with shared and/ or peculiar origins.

Though the call for a sane approach to creolistics goes back to {{Harvcoltxt|Givón|1979}}, the first unbiased overview of the scientifically meaningful characteristics of creole languages must go to the credit of {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}. In their account of approaches to creole genesis, they group theories into four categories:

:* ''Theories focusing on the [[Europe]]an input''
:* ''Theories focusing on the non-European input''
:* ''[[Gradualist]] and [[Developmental linguistics|developmental]] hypotheses''
:* ''[[Universalist]] approaches''

The authors also confine [[Pidgins]] and [[mixed languages]] into separate chapters outside this scheme whether or not relexification come into the picture.

A '''''determinatio''''' is an authoritative determination by the legislator concerning the application of practical principles, that is not necessitated by deduction from natural&lt;ref name=Finnis&gt;Finnis, John. ''Aquinas'', 266-271.&lt;/ref&gt;  or divine law&lt;ref name=Hervada33&gt;Hervada, ''Introduction'', pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; but is based on the contingencies of practical judgement within the possibilities allowed by reason.&lt;ref name="Finnis"/&gt;

In [[natural law]] jurisprudence, ''determinatio'' is the process of making natural law into positive law&lt;ref name=Waldron&gt;Waldron, Jeremy. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1722308 ''Torture, Suicide, and Determinatio'' main page], Social Science Research Network. Accessed 22 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]], ''determinatio'' is the act by which natural law or divine positive law is made determinate in the canonical legal system as specific norms of law,&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; although the content of such law is still essentially that of divine law, which, together with canon law, forms "a single juridical system of law".&lt;ref name=Hervada34&gt;Hervada, ''Introduction'', pg. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept derives from the [[legal philosophy]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-law-theories/#PurPosLawDetTheLegMorAutForCitJudFacMadReaForAct Natural Law Theories], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, accessed 23 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to be a part of discussions in natural law theory.&lt;ref name=Waldron/&gt;

==Canon law==
{{main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
{{see also|Treatise on Law}}
''Determinatio'' is a legal doctrine in the jurisprudence of the canon law of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; It was imported from the legal philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Hervada, ''Introduction'', pg. 34 (citing ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]'' [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2095.htm#article3 Ia-IIæ q.95 a.3])&lt;/ref&gt;

The general norms of divine or natural law serve as "shaping factors"&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; and "a necessary basis"&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; for the human-made canon law, but such general norms in themselves cannot have a greater legal effect until they are made into specific human laws, since the norms of divine law are "general and non-specific".&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt;

But in the movement from the general to the concrete, there are sometimes many possibilities;&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; that is, divine or natural law can be made concrete in may different ways,&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; and all the legitimate alternatives are in line with the requirements of divine law.&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; Wherefore the legislator must make a ''determinatio'' and "opt or choose among them".&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt;

'''''Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|ドラゴンクエストIV 導かれし者たち|Doragon Kuesuto Fō Michibikareshi Monotachi|lit. "Dragon Quest IV: The Guided Ones"}}. Known in English speaking parts of Europe and in Australia as '''''Dragon Quest: The Chapters of the Chosen''''', on the Nintendo DS.}}, originally published as '''''Dragon Warrior IV''''' in North America, is a [[role-playing video game]] and the fourth installment of the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' video game series developed by [[Chunsoft]] and published by [[Enix]]. It was originally released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] on 11 February 1990 in Japan. A North American NES version followed in October 1992, and would be the last ''Dragon Quest'' game localized and published by Enix's [[Enix#North America|Enix America Corporation]] subsidiary prior to its closure in November 1995, as well as the last ''Dragon Quest'' game to be localized into English prior to the localization of ''[[Dragon Warrior Monsters]]'' in December 1999. The game was [[enhanced remake|remade]] by Heartbeat for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which eventually was available as an [[Ultimate Hit]]s title. This was followed with a second remake developed by [[ArtePiazza]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], released in Japan on 22 November 2007. This remake was released in Australia on 11 September 2008, in Europe on 12 September 2008&lt;ref name="eurorelease"&gt;{{cite web | title=EXPERIENCE DRAGON QUEST IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND ZENITHIA TRILOGY ANNOUNCED FOR EUROPE | url=http://www.mcvuk.com/press-releases/37219/DRAGON-QUEST-The-Chapters-of-the-Chosen | publisher=MCV | date=2008-05-21 | accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in North America on September 16, 2008. A version based on the Nintendo DS remake for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] was released in 2014.

''Dragon Quest IV'' differs from the rest of the series by breaking up the game into five distinct chapters, each of which focuses on a different protagonist or protagonists. The first four are told from the perspective of the Hero's future companions and the fifth one, from the hero's perspective, brings all the characters together as they start their journey to save the world.&lt;ref name="NP46"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Staff |date=March 1993 |title= ''Dragon Warrior IV'' |journal= [[Nintendo Power]] |volume= |issue=46 |pages= 82–87 | publisher= Nintendo of America| id= |url=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PlayStation remake adds a sixth chapter, which is retained in the DS remake.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Dragon Quest IV.png|left|thumb|The Hero and the party with a wagon that is able to travel through one of selected dungeon areas in the NES version of ''Dragon Quest IV'', where menu commands and character stats are displayed]]
''Dragon Quest IV'' offered several new features over the first three titles, while carrying on many of those introduced in the previous games.&lt;ref name="NP46"/&gt; Similar features included are the day and night cycles, the ability to travel via ship and a flying vehicle (this time, a hot air balloon), and the three levels of keys. They are Thief, Magic and Ultimate (originally localized as Final). There are also travel doors, which allow the party to move a great distance on the world map with little travel. Unlike the Hero in ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'', the Hero of ''Dragon Quest IV'' is not required to be in the party at all once the wagon becomes available. Despite this, the Hero is again the character that possesses the most powerful healing and attack spells. Many spells, weapons, armor, and shops (including the vault/bank) function the same as in past games.

In addition to the new chapter-based storylines, an [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] system called "Tactics" was implemented that allowed the player to provide strategies to the party members (who become [[Non-player character|NPCs]] in the final chapter), such as prioritizing damage, healing or MP conservation, while maintaining full control of the Hero. ''[[Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride]]'', ''[[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation]]'' and the remakes of IV allow tactics to be set for characters individually rather than using one tactics mode for all characters, as well as including the "Follow Orders" Tactics mode, which allows other characters to be controlled manually.&lt;ref name="kurt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3520/the_history_of_dragon_quest.php|title=The History of Dragon Quest|accessdate=2009-09-30|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|date=2008-02-04|work=Gamasutra|publisher=Gamasutra}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "Tactics" system is seen as a precursor to ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'''s "[[Time-keeping systems in games#Pausable real-time|Gambits]]" system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reeves|first=Ben|title=A Warrior’s Quest: A Retrospective of Square-Enix’s Classic RPG Series|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/02/14/a-warrior-s-quest-a-retrospective-of-square-enix-s-classic-rpg-series.aspx|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=28 December 2011|date=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wagon, first introduced in this game, allows the player to choose which characters are used in battle. The wagon can also be seen in ''Dragon Quest V'' and ''Dragon Quest VI''. The first casino appears in this installment as a place to play several mini-games ([[slot machine]], [[poker]], and the Monster Betting that was introduced in ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'') using tokens that could be traded for special items. Searching drawers and inside of jars was first introduced in this game as a means to find items. Small Medals, later Mini Medals, were introduced as a new item to search for and trade for special unique items from a secluded king.

Saving the game was made easier by allowing one to save a game in a House of Healing, rather than talking to a king.&lt;ref name="kurt"/&gt; Also, the save ("Confession" in the DS remake) and EXP point to the next level-up ("Divination" in the DS remake) are now separate commands. Returning to the format of the original North American ''Dragon Warrior'', programmers allowed users to open a door using a command appearing in the top level of the menu (rather than requiring users to search through various characters' inventories for the key as in some previous games). The only requirement was that at least one character in the party needed to have an appropriate key in his or her inventory. Since this command was added, an unlocked door was added in this game, as well as large Castle Doors. However, this command was eliminated in later games and the remake, in which doors can be opened by attempting to walk through them.

==Synopsis==

===Plot===
In the original version, the game is divided into five [[chapter (books)|chapters]]. The first four provide back-story for the Hero’s party members, while the fifth follows the Hero himself or herself as he or she meets up with the other characters. 

Chapter One begins when a knight from Burland (Ragnar) is tasked to find children who have gone missing from a nearby town.  Ragnar finds and defeats the monster responsible for the abductions and returns the children to their homes. In doing so, he learns the monsters were looking for the Legendary Hero (in order to kill him or her), who is supposedly still a child.  Ragnar decides to leave his home and set out on a quest to protect him.&lt;ref name="kurt" /&gt;

Chapter Two follows the tomboyish Princess Alena and her two friends/mentors, tutor Borya (localized as Brey) and chancellor Kiryl (localized as Cristo) as she travels to prove her strength.&lt;ref name="kurt" /&gt; Partway through her journey, Alena’s father (the King) loses his voice after speaking of a dream he had depicting the end of the world. After restoring his voice, she travels to the town of Endor to enter a fighting tournament. She defeats all of the combatants except a warrior named Psaro the Manslayer (originally localized as Saro until he rescues Rosa from humans and changes his name to Necrosaro), who fails to appear. After the victory, she returns to her home castle to find all the inhabitants have gone missing, so she sets out to find out what happened to everyone.

Chapter Three follows a merchant named Torneko (localized as Taloon), a humble merchant working in a weapon shop in his hometown with his wife and young son.  His dream is to own his own shop and be the world's greatest merchant.  As he travels and performs favors at the towns he visits, Torneko eventually obtains permission to purchase a shop in Endor.  By finding the rare Silver Statuette in a nearby cave, Torneko is able to obtain the funds to purchase the shop and move his family to Endor. After establishing a successful business with his wife, he hears about a set of legendary weapons, which he sets out to find by funding the construction of an underground passageway to a neighboring continent.

Chapter Four follows Maya and Meena, two sisters seeking revenge for the murder of their father. By teaming up with a former student of their father (Oojam), they manage to plot a way into Keeleon Castle and find the man responsible.  They avenge their father’s murder by defeating the King of Keeleon, but are quickly defeated by the King's master and thrown in the dungeon. Oojam sacrifices himself to allow the sisters to escape the castle.  They then decide to flee the continent and head for Endor, where they hope to learn more about their new foe and about the Legendary Hero, whom they became aware of during their travels.

Chapter Five follows the game's [[protagonist]], known as the Hero.&lt;ref name="kurt"/&gt; It begins with the Hero’s hometown being attacked by monsters, led by Psaro the Manslayer. The Hero manages to escape, and is joined by the main characters of the previous chapters, as well as Hoffman, who drives the cart. Together, they spy on Psaro and discover that Estark, the Ruler of Evil (originally localized as Esturk), has been awakened. Their quest then becomes to travel to Estark’s palace and defeat him.

In the town of Strathbaile&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; (originally localized as Izmit), the heroes have a dream that explains Psaro’s plan. Developing a deep hatred of humanity after the death of his [[Elf|elven]] girlfriend, Rose (originally localized as Rosa), at the hands of humans, Psaro plans to become the next Ruler of Evil using the power of [[Transmutation of species|evolution]] he obtained from the "Armlet of [[Alchemy|Transmutation]]" (an item Alena's party had obtained and given away in Chapter 2 as a ransom payment for a kidnapped woman.)  The party then obtains the four pieces of the Zenithian weapons and armor (sword, shield, body armor, and helm) to permit entry into Zenithian Castle. There, they meet the Zenith [[Dragon]], who takes them to Nadiria (originally localized as Evil World), where Psaro is undergoing his evolution into the new Ruler of Evil. There, they defeat his generals before challenging Psaro. After fighting a continually evolving form of Psaro, he is vanquished.

The PlayStation and DS remakes include a sixth chapter. This chapter focuses on the heroes working with Psaro to avenge the death of Rose, and finally put the world back in order. Throughout this chapter, Rose is revived and the party is able to defeat her true killer, the Dark Priest [[Aamon]] (originally localized as Radimvice), one of Psaro the Manslayer's subordinates who intended to take the secrets of evolution for himself and usurp Psaro the Manslayer, setting all plans in motion that drove Psaro to his insanity.

===Characters===
[[File:Dragon Quest IV characters.jpg|thumb|Characters of ''Dragon Quest IV'': ''(top row, from left)'' Torneko, Kiryl, Alena, Meena, and Maya; ''(bottom row)'' Ragnar, the Male Hero, the Female Hero, and Borya]]
These are the main characters of the story, and are controllable party members during their introduction chapters (Chapters 1-4). When they join the Hero in Chapter 5, the other party members become NPC characters that are only controlled by the ''Tactics'' command. In the re-releases, this setting can be changed to ''Follow Orders'', which allows the player to choose their actions. Also, with the re-releases, many of the character's names were changed to be closer, or incorporate their Original Japanese names.

* '''Hero''' ''(Male Hero is named Solo, while the Female Hero is named Sofia) &lt;ref&gt;Dragon Quest 4 Japanese Playstation Manual&lt;/ref&gt; ''The main character of the game, who's eighteen-years-old and does not appear until Chapter 5. The Hero can use the best equipment, and is the only character who can learn lightning spells and the most powerful healing spell in the game, Omniheal (originally localized as HealUsAll). In the DS remake, the Hero also learns Gigasword, the game's most powerful single-target attack spell. The player can choose the name and gender of the hero. The gender of the hero has little impact to the story, only affecting some dialogue, although a few optional weapons, pieces of armor, and accessories can only be equipped by female characters. In the remakes, the Hero first appears during a short prologue chapter before Chapter 1.&lt;ref name="NP230"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Loe |first= Casey|date=July 2008 |title= A flight of Dragons |journal= [[Nintendo Power]] |volume= |issue=230 |pages= 50–57| publisher= Future USA, Inc| id= |url=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{nihongo|'''Ragnar McRyan'''|ライアン|''Ryan''|''originally localized as Ragnar''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Captain of the Burland (a Scottish English speaking land) army, and Royal Knight. He investigates a case of children who are disappearing throughout the kingdom which is causing havoc and despair throughout the kingdom. He first appears in Chapter 1. He also cameos in Chapters 2 (Inn by Endor) and 3 (Endor Casino). He is the classic Warrior or Soldier, specializing in melee combat with no magical abilities, and he also has a very low base agility score, so he will often strike last out of all the party members. Ragnar is the last character to join the Hero in Chapter 5, having coincidentally set out to kill the Marquis de Leon (originally localized as Keeleon) at the same time the party arrives.
* {{nihongo|'''[[Tsarevna]] Alena'''|アリーナ姫|''Arîna Hime''|''Arlina'', ''originally localized as Princess Alena''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Tomboyish Princess of the Zamoksva (a Russian dialect English speaking land)&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; (''originally localized as Santeem'') Kingdom. She is bored of the palace life and wishes to travel the world, much to the dismay of her father and his officials who urge her to act more like a woman instead of a tomboy. This could be due to the possibility that she had overheard her father discuss a dream he had with his chancellor and wishes to do something to ease his fears. She first appears in Chapter 2 but joins after the party cures Kiryl with a [[Feverfew]] Root (originally localized as "Padequia Root"). She is the classic Fighter or Martial Artist, preferring to use claws as a weapon though she can use other weapons as well.
* {{nihongo|'''Borya'''|ブライ|''Burai''|''originally localized as Brey''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Alena's tutor. He's a magician who travels with Alena to look after her because he promised her late mother to do so. He learns Ice attack magic, and more [[buff (computer gaming)|buff and debuff]] spells than Maya, such as ''Oomph'' and ''Acceleratle''; in the DS remake, he also learns ''Snoop'' (localized as ''MapMagic'' in other games in the series), a spell generally associated with the thief class which reveals the location of treasures. He first appears in Chapter 2, and he joins the party to search for a Feverfew Seed to cure Kiryl's sickness right away.
* {{nihongo|'''Kiryl'''|クリフト|''Kurifuto''|''Clift'', ''originally localized as Cristo''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; A priest (originally localized as chancellor) that travels along with Alena and Borya, and has feelings for Alena (but she is oblivious to it)&lt;ref name="DQ4Site"&gt;{{cite web|author=Square-Enix |year=2008 |title=Dragon Quest IV (Official Site) |url=http://na.square-enix.com/dq4/ |work= |accessdate=June 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620055852/http://na.square-enix.com/dq4/ |archivedate=June 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He can use healing and support magic, as well as instant death spells. He first appears in Chapter 2, but is recruited in Chapter 5 after the Hero finds a rare Feverfew Seed to grow into a Feverfew Root and to cure his sickness.
* {{nihongo|'''[[Torneko|Torneko Taloon]]'''|トルネコ|''Toruneko''|''originally localized as Taloon''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; A weapons merchant from Lakanaba (an Irish English speaking town), who wishes to open his own store. He first appears in Chapter 3. He is much like the Merchant class in other Dragon Quest games, however he also learns abilities used by Jesters, Thieves and Dancers in other games in the series, when he joins the Hero in Chapter 5 he sometimes performs a random action in battle, such as summoning an army of merchants, throwing sand in the enemy's eyes, tripping and scoring a critical hit on an enemy or stealing an item from an enemy. In the DS remake, he learns four non-combat spells: ''padfoot'', which reduces the encounter rate, ''eye for distance'', which locates the nearest town, ''nose for treasure'', which reveals the number of remaining treasures in the area, and ''whistle'', which causes a [[random encounter]].
* {{nihongo|'''Maya'''|マーニャ|''Mânya''|''originally localized as Mara''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; A dancer who works in Lassize Fayre (originally localized as Monbaraba) and is originally from Aubout du Monde (originally localized as Kievs) who can use magic, primarily fire and explosion attack spells. Her father, Mahabala&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; (originally localized as Edgar), died under mysterious circumstances. It is later revealed that he was murdered by Balzack, her father's apprentice, who was driven mad by the Secret of Evolution. She and her sister seek revenge. They both first appear in Chapter 4, and are the first to join the Hero in Chapter 5, after Meena reads the Hero's fortune.
* {{nihongo|'''Meena'''|ミネア|''Minea''|''originally localized as Nara''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Maya's younger sister. She is a fortune teller that can use healing spells and wind attack spells, as well as support spells. Unlike Kiryl or the hero, she cannot learn any multi-target healing spells other than the ''Kerplunk'' spell (which knocks her out to heal everyone else at once), but only she can use her Tarot weapon as a battle item to generate random effects, similar to the Chance (or ''Hocus Pocus'') spell in other DQ games. Meena reads the Hero's fortune in Endor and joins because of the unique destiny she read.
* {{nihongo|'''Psaro'''|ピサロ|''originally localized as Saro and Necrosaro}} A monster who is the main villain of Chapter 5. In Chapter 6 of the PlayStation and DS remakes, he is a recruitable party member, seeking revenge against Aamon. Like the Hero, Psaro is a fighter / spellcaster hybrid, with a mixture of attack, healing, buff and debuff magic, and the ability to wield powerful weapons and wear heavy armour. Furthermore, Psaro can learn various special attacks (originally introduced to the series in [[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation|Dragon Quest VI]]), and can use cursed equipment without penalty.

'''Non-Playable Characters:'''

These characters join the party temporarily. Unlike permanent party members, they cannot gain levels or [[experience point]]s, cannot change their equipment, and their actions in battle cannot be controlled through the ''Tactics'' command (instead, they are always lockd into their default AI mode).

* '''Healie''', a friendly Healslime who meets Ragnar during Chapter 1. He is an invaluable ally, providing free healing, saving Ragnar the trouble so he can concentrate on killing monsters. After Ragnar joins the party in Chapter 5, Healie can be seen in a human form in the courtyard of Keeleon Castle.
* '''Laurel''' &amp; '''Hardie''' (''originally localized as Laurent and Strom''), two mercenaries who Taloon can meet in Endor during Chapter 3. Hardie, a soldier, requests 400 Gold and simply uses a powerful physical attack each turn. Laurel, a magician, requests 600 and has a small, versatile magical repertoire along with an average physical attack which can cause paralysis. While unconnected story-wise, their naming in the DS remake is a nod to the early-20th century comedy duo, [[Laurel and Hardy]].
* '''Oojam''' (''originally localized as Orin''), he was a student of Maya and Meena's father that went into hiding after Balzack had killed his teacher. The girls seek him out during Chapter 4 to assist them in their quest for revenge. Oojam provides a powerful physical attack each turn, in addition to being able to pick locks. At the end of Chapter 4, Oojam appears to be mortally wounded fending off the guards of Palais de Léon (originally localized as Castle Keeleon) to allow Meena and Maya to escape, but it is revealed in Chapter 5 that a young woman who was fleeing the castle found him near-dead and managed to get him safely to the town of Vrenor so he can rest and recover.
* '''Hank Hoffman Junior''' (''originally localized as Hector''), a young man hanging out near Casabranca who is initially cold to people, having been betrayed by a friend. After the Hero finds the "Symbol of Faith" in a nearby cave, Hoffman offers to lend the party his services, and his wagon. He tags along for a short while until shortly after Torneko is recruited, then leaves his cart to the Hero so he can pursue his own endeavors in owning an inn. In the DS remake, he resurfaces later at the oasis where he opens up the "Immigrant Town" sidequest.
* '''Tom Foolery''' (''originally localized as Panon''), he is a performer who works at the same stage-house as Maya and Meena. While not particularly good at combat, Tom is necessary for one game mission which nets the Hero the Zenithian Helm.
* '''Orifiela''' (''originally localized as Lucia''), a Zenithian the party encounters at the Great World Tree, [[Yggdrasil]]. She needs the party to help her get back up to Zenithia, and provides the party with information regarding the Zenithian Sword.
* '''Sparkie''' (''originally localized as Doran''), a baby dragon found in Zenithia. Apparently, Zenithians have conducted research that suggests dragons mature faster than Zenithians do. He doesn't have great battle intelligence, but can occasionally mow down enemies or put them to sleep with a breath attack. In the remakes, he leaves the party once Rose is resurrected.

According to [[Yuji Horii]], he wanted to have something the player went around collecting as the previous ''Dragon Quest'' games had crests and orbs respectively. However, he did not want to do the same thing over again by forcing the player to collect a certain number of items before they beat the game; mini medals instead have nothing to do with clearing the game.&lt;ref name="Jump8"&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:週刊少年ジャンプ|trans-title=[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]|volume=45|year=1989|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|location=Japan|language=Japanese|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promotional illustrations for the Japanese version was drawn by famed manga artist [[Akira Toriyama]], whom provided the artwork for the previous games in the series and would continue to do so for every future installment.&lt;ref name=techbuffalo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2014/10/11/history-of-dragon-quest-localizations-1989-to-2001/|title=History of Dragon Quest Localizations - 1989 to 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike all the other games up to this point, the changes in this version were not as radical. Among them were the usual religious/violence censorship, new graphics for the opening copyright and ending credits, and the betting in the Casino was slightly modified to allow more money being won during a bet.

=== PlayStation remake ===

[[File:Dragon Quest IV remake.jpg|right|thumb|One of overworld areas of the PlayStation ''Dragon Quest IV'' remake]]

''Dragon Quest IV'' was [[enhanced remake|remade]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] on November 22, 2001 in Japan. It was developed by [[Heartbeat (company)|Heartbeat]] and published by Enix. The remake was developed using ''Dragon Quest VII's'' 3D graphics engine. The characters, towns, world maps, sound, battles and enemies all received updates. The character sprites were updated to match the original artwork for the characters in the original ''Dragon Quest IV'' Manual and artwork.
With this remake came several new features. Among these features were a new chapter in which Psaro is available as a party member (as well as a prologue chapter), an intra-party talk command similar to ''Dragon Quest VII'', and the ability to turn off the artificial intelligence for party members to allow for direct control of their attacks (except UC Party Members). The game sold over one million copies in Japan by the end of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Witham, Joseph | date=December 12, 2001 | title=Enix Ships 1 Million Copies of Dragon Quest IV | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2001/121201b.html | work=RPGamer.com | accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enix|Enix America]] originally planned to bring the remake to [[North America]] in 2002 and had even advertised this upcoming release on the back cover to the US instruction manual for ''Dragon Warrior VII'', but it was later canceled due to Heartbeat closing its video game development operations before the localization and translation could be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN staff | date=August 22, 2001 | title=Dragon Quest IV Headed Stateside | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/097/097618p1.html | work=IGN.com | accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Eric Malenfant |author2=Eve C. |author3=Nicole Kirk | year=2002 | title=Enix Interview With Justin Lucas | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/features/e32k2-enix/index.html | work=RPGFan.com | accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later explained that the cost and time that a different company would need to invest to complete the translation prevented Enix from passing this to another developer, as Heartbeat was the most familiar with their own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Dwaine Bullock | year=2005 | title=Dragon Warrior IV: The Explanation | url=http://www.dqshrine.com/features/dw4.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111214556/http://www.dqshrine.com/features/dw4.htm | archivedate=2009-01-11 | work= | accessdate=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nintendo DS remake ===

''Dragon Quest IV'' was later re-released for the [[Nintendo DS]] in Japan in November 2007. The game has been remade into a 2D/3D hybrid, similar to the PlayStation version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Square Enix | year=2007 | title=Dragon Quest 4 to 6 | url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/dragonquest/4to6/ | work= | accessdate=September 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This release has kept many of the enhancements from the PlayStation, such as the slightly altered immigrant town, but has received enhanced upgrades to smooth the graphics further, and improved sound. This release also allows players to take manual control of all of their party members in the final two chapters.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt;

Shortly after the Japanese release, several people editing the Japanese ROM file discovered a near complete English translation along with Spanish, French, German, and Italian translations already inside the Japanese game.&lt;ref name=discovered&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2007/12/13/dragon-quest-iv-hides-a-partial-english-translation/|publisher=Siliconera|accessdate=2016-06-08|date=2007-12-13|author=Spencer|title=Dragon Quest IV hides a partial English translation}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 9, 2008, Square Enix applied for a trademark to the title "Chapters of the Chosen", and speculation began that this was the new subtitle to ''Dragon Quest IV'' for an American release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Spencer | year=2008 | title=Siliconera » Square Enix trademarks Chapters of the Chosen (update: Dragon Quest IV?) | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2008/04/16/square-enix-trademarks-chapters-of-the-chosen-any-guesses/ | work= | accessdate=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008, ''Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen'' was found to have a rating of E10+ by the ESRB, for Alcohol Reference, Animated Blood, Mild Fantasy Violence, Mild Language, Simulated Gambling, and Suggestive Themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=ESRB| year=2008 | title=Entertainment Software Rating Board | url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/search.jsp | work= | accessdate=April 18, 2008}} - May need to input ''Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen'' to get result&lt;/ref&gt; An official release date of September 16, 2008 was finally established on the official North American site.&lt;ref name="NADS"/&gt; The game was released in Europe under the title ''Dragon Quest: Chapters of the Chosen'', omitting the number IV in a similar fashion to the European version of [[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King|Dragon Quest VIII]].&lt;ref name="eurorelease"/&gt;

This version of the game contains an entirely new translation of the script.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; It was claimed in Nintendo Power that the new translation has changed the names of many of the main characters, weapons and towns to be closer to, or include their original Japanese names, while adding several new localizations,&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; yet an analysis of the location and character names indicates the original localization of ''Dragon Warrior IV'' was closer to the original Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year= | title=List of Name Changes in the Zenithia Trilogy | url=https://dragon-quest.org/wiki/List_of_Name_Changes_in_the_Zenithia_Trilogy | work=Dragon Quest Wiki | accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version also uses the new spell naming convention first used in ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King|Dragon Quest VIII]]'', such as the spell ''Beat'' from ''Dragon Warrior IV'' becoming ''Whack''.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; The western translations have been slightly changed in places where the Japanese version included sexual components, and the Japanese version's party talk feature was completely excised from the western versions.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt;

The Nintendo DS [[English language|English]] translation includes 13 regional dialects for the various areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=EBGAMES | year=2008 | title=EBGames.com - Buy Dragon Quest IV - Nintendo DS | url=http://www.ebgames.com/ds/games/dragon-quest-iv/71541 | work= | accessdate=June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Burland now being Scottish, and Zamoksva being Russian.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Simon Carless of [[Gamasutra]] feels that the use of dialects can help some people to understand different cultures, saying, "It has the potential to nurture cross-language and cross-cultural understanding in a very intelligent manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23659|title= Analysis: The Implications of Dialect in Dragon Quest IV|work=News|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|first=Simon|last=Carless|date=2009-05-19|accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version also reintroduces the party talk feature removed from the international Nintendo DS releases, being translated into the appropriate language.

== Other media ==

=== Manga ===

A five volume manga called ''Dragon Quest: Princess Alena'' was released. It followed the story of Chapter 2, Alena's adventure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |title=Dragon Quest Manga |url=http://www.dqshrine.com/ma/other/ |work= |accessdate=September 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822182900/http://www.dqshrine.com/ma/other/ |archivedate=August 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Beth | last=Cato | year=2003 | title=Besu's Dragon Quest Slime Shrine:Manga: Dragon Quest IV: | url=http://www.slimeshrine.net/manga/DQIVmanga.html | work= | accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but begins to divert during the events in the Birdsong Tower. From this point forward, it introduces several new characters, including the evil Evil Leather [[Dominatrix]] Woman, and new locations, including an Arctic location and a haunted house. This story ends with Alena fighting Psaro and defeating him before he goes on with the Golden Bracelet to perfect the secret of evolution.

=== Soundtrack ===

As with every ''Dragon Quest'', [[Koichi Sugiyama]] composed the music and directed all the associated spinoffs. The song heard during gameplay depends on a number of factors. A specific track is always played for towns, another for caves or dungeons, another while the party is mounted on the hot air balloon, for instance. Lastly, while out in the world, each of the first four acts has its own theme song, as does the Hero—in act five, the theme song played depends on who is the first character in the formation.

The original ''Dragon Warrior IV'' was one of the few NES games to feature a ''[[crescendo]]'' during the battle music, a gradual increase in volume from soft to loud. This technique was rare for an NES game. However, the PlayStation and Nintendo DS versions do not feature the crescendo in the battle music. This level of detail can be found in the NES version's soundtrack, as well as the 2014 Android and iOS mobile releases.

''Dragon Quest IV ~The People Are Shown the Way~ Symphonic Suite'' is a compilation of music from ''Dragon Quest IV''. The first print of the album was in 1990, the London Philharmonic version came out a year later, and a reprint of the original was released in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Lucy Rzeminski | year=2007 | title=Dragon Quest IV soundtrack | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/dq4-ss/index.html | work= | accessdate=August 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dragon Warrior IV'' was awarded "[[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Game Grand Prize]]", "Best RPG Game" and the "[[List of best-selling video games|Best-Seller Award]]" in ''[[Famitsu]]''{{'}}s 1990 awards, "Best Challenge" and 2nd place "Best Overall Game" in 1993 by ''[[Nintendo Power]]''.&lt;ref name="famitsu-award"&gt;[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.video/OccmuafYtzc Best Games of 1990], ''Famicom Tsushin''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NintendoPowerAwards"/&gt;

In August 2008, ''Nintendo Power'' ranked ''Dragon Warrior IV'' the 18th best [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] video game, describing it as the peak of the NES' ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series and praising it for its innovative five-act story that made it one of their favourite old-school role-playing games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 2008 |title= Best of the Best |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |volume= |issue=231 |page= 71| publisher= Future USA, Inc| id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers of ''[[Famitsu]]'' voted the game as the 14th best game of all time in a 2006 poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Edge Staff | date=March 6, 2006 | title=Japan Votes on All Time Top 100 | url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/japan-votes-all-time-top-100/ | work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, critics noticed with interest that the game's third chapter, Torneko's, departed largely from standard RPGs by making the only goal to collect money and by allowing players to have Torneko simply working in an in-game store.&lt;ref name="kurt"/&gt;

In Japan, the original Famicom version sold 3.1 million units, it's the fourth best selling game of the system, below its predecessor, ''Dragon Quest III''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Famicom Software| url=https://sites.google.com/site/gamedatalibrary/software-by-platform/famicom| work=Game Data Library | accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One million of its sales occurred in its first day of release.&lt;ref name=sales2&gt;{{cite journal |title=Westward, Ho!

"Ragnar McRyan is in no way a character designed off the back of some intense Japanese schoolgirl demographic focus testing", wrote [[Eurogamer]]'s Simon Parkin, pleased.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web | author=Parkin, Simon | title= Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen | date=September 15, 2008 | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/dragon-quest-iv-chapters-of-the-chosen-review | work=[[Eurogamer]] | accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequels===
''Dragon Quest IV'' is the first game in the series to spawn spin-offs. The merchant [[Torneko]] (also known as Taloon in the NES version) was popular enough to star his own series, in which he finds himself in quests in order to expand his store. These games are the ''Torneko no Daibouken'' sub-series (translated as ''Torneko's Great Adventure''), [[roguelike]] and [[random dungeon]] games produced by [[Enix]] (and [[Square Enix]]) and developed by [[Chunsoft]]. The success of the games later inspired the creation of the ''[[Mystery Dungeon]]'' series.

Ragnar, Healie, and Torneko all later appear as cameos in ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King#Development and release|Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King]]'' in the Monster Arena. Torneko later cameos in ''[[Dragon Quest: Shōnen Yangus to Fushigi no Dungeon|Dragon Quest Yangus]]'' as a merchant.

{{Rights |Human}}
'''Economic, social and cultural rights''' are [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] [[human rights]], such as the [[right to education]], [[right to housing]], [[right to adequate standard of living]], [[right to health]], [[victims' rights]] and the [[right to science and culture]]. Economic, social and cultural rights are recognised and protected in international and regional human rights instruments. Member states have a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil economic, social and cultural rights and are expected to take "progressive action" towards their fulfilment.

The [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]] recognises a number of economic, social and cultural rights and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) is the primary international legal source of economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] recognises and protects many of the economic, social and cultural rights recognised in the ICESCR in relation to children and women. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin in relation to a number of economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] also prohibits all discrimination on the basis of the disability including refusal of the [[reasonable accommodation]] relating to full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.

== International and regional human rights instruments ==
Economic, social and cultural rights are recognized and protected in a number of international and regional human rights instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International human rights instruments ===
The [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]] (UDHR), adopted by the [[UN General Assembly]] in 1948, is one of the most important sources of economic, social and cultural rights. It recognizes the [[right to social security]] in Article 22, the [[right to work]] in Article 23, the [[right to rest and leisure]] in Article 24, the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] in Article 25, the [[right to education]] in Article 26, and the [[right to benefits of science and culture]] in Article 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) is the primary international legal source of economic, social and cultural rights. The Covenant recognized and protects the [[right to work]] and to just and favorable working conditions in Article 6 and 7, the right to join [[trade unions]] and take collective labor action in Article 8, the [[right to social security]] in Article 9, the right to protection of the family, including protection for mothers and children, in Article 10, the [[right to an adequate standard of living]], including the [[right to food]] and the [[right to housing]], in Article 11, the [[right to health]] in Article 12, the [[right to education]] in Article 13, as well as the right to participate in cultural life and  the [[right to benefits of science and culture]] in Article 15. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], adopted at the same time as the ICESCR, recognizes and protects a number of core economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to join [[trade unions]] in Article 22, and the right of ethnic, religious or linguistic [[minority group|minorities]] to engage in their culture, practice their religion and use their language in Article 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other major international human rights instruments contain provisions relating to economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] recognizes and protects many of the economic, social and cultural rights recognized in the ICESCR in relation to children. Including the [[right to health]] in Article 24, the [[right to social security]] in Article 25, the right to an adequate standard of living in Article 27, the [[right to education]] in Article 28, and the right to protection from economic exploitation (see [[child labour]]) in Article 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin in relation to a number of economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] affirms a range of economic, social and cultural rights to women. The [[ILO Conventions]] of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) protect a range of work related economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional human rights instruments ===
The [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] protects the [[right to work]] in Article 15, the [[right to health]] in Article 16, and the [[right to education]] in Article 17. The [[European Social Charter]] protects a wide range of economic, social and cultural rights, including the [[right to work]], to favourable working conditions, the right to join [[trade unions]] and to take collective labour action in Article 1 to 10, the [[right to health]] in Article 11, the [[right to social security]], including the right to medical assistance and the right to social welfare services, in Article 12 to 14, protection of especially [[social vulnerability|vulnerable groups]] are enshrined in Article 15 to 17 and 19, and [[right to housing]] in Article 31. The [[Protocol of San Salvador]] protects a range of economic, social and cultural rights within the Inter-American human rights system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secondary legal sources ==
A range of secondary legal sources exist on economic, social and cultural rights which provide guidance on their normative definition. An important secondary legal source is the [[United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] which is overseeing the implementation of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR). The Committee has been central in developing the normative definition of key economic, social and cultural rights, interpreting the role of State Parties to the ICESCR, and monitoring protection and violation of the ICESCR rights. The Committee issues guiding pronouncements in the form of ''general comments'', and other human rights treaty bodies may also issue comments relevant to economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important secondary legal sources on economic, social and cultural rights are the [[Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] 1987 and the [[Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] 1997. The Limburg Principles have been extensively used in national legal systems as an interpretive tool for establishing violations of economic, social and cultural rights. The Maastricht Guidelines build on the Limburg Principles and identify the legal implications of acts and omissions which are violations of economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv-xvi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs]] have influenced the normative development of economic, social and cultural rights. Appointed by the [[Commission on Human Rights]] and its sub-commissions, key rapporteurs include the Special Rapporteur on the Realization of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, and the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xvi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National constitutions ==
A number of national constitutions recognize economic, social and cultural rights. For example, the 1996 [[Constitution of South Africa]]  includes economic, social and cultural rights and the [[South African Constitutional Court]] has heard claims under these obligations (see ''[[Grootboom]]'' and ''[[Treatment Action Campaign]]'' cases). [[India's constitution]], which does not explicitly recognize economic and social rights in their constitution, has nonetheless found that these rights exist, though [[unenumerated rights|unenumerated]], inferable from the right to life. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

== State responsibility ==
Economic, social and cultural right enshrined in international and regional human rights instruments are legally binding. Member states have a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil these rights. The exact nature of states' obligations in this respect has been established principally in relation to the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xvi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] has been established in accordance with [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], Part II paragraph 75&lt;/ref&gt;

State parties to the ICESCR are required to take "progressive action" towards fulfilment of the ICESR rights. While immediate fulfilment may not be possible due to the economic situation of a country, postponement of proactive action is not permitted. State parties must show genuine efforts to secure the economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in the ICESCR. The burden of proof for progressive action is considered on be with the state party. The prohibition on [[discrimination]] in relation to economic, social and cultural rights is regarded as having immediate effect. State parties must abolish laws, policies and practices which affect the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and take action to prevent discrimination in public life. All state parties, regardless of the economic situation in the country or resource scarcity, are required to ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all. State parties must also ensure that available resources are accessed and used equitably. Therefore, government decisions on how to allocate resources should be subject to scrutiny. Legislative measures alone are not sufficient to ensure compliance with the ICESCR and state parties are expected to provide judicial remedies in addition to taking administrative, financial, educational and social measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xvi-xvii | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monitoring, enforcement and implementation framework ==
[[Intergovernmental organisations]] and [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs) have persistently neglected economic, social and cultural rights over the past 50 years.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} While all human rights are said to be "equal, indivisible, interrelated, and interdependent", the monitoring, enforcement and implementation framework for economic, social and cultural rights is less advanced than that for [[civil and political rights]]. International enforcement mechanisms are strongest for civil and political rights, and their violation is considered more serious than that of economic, social and cultural rights. There are few international NGOs that focus on economic, social and cultural rights and there are few lawyers who have the knowledge or experience to defend economic, social and cultural rights at a national or international level. Economic, social and cultural rights are less likely than civil and political rights to be protected in national constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiii | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], which gives the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] competence to receive and consider communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the Covenant have been violated by a state party. The Protocol entered into force on 5 May 2013.

== Advocacy ==
Networking groups such as [[ESCR-Net]] are working to create online resources and spread information about effective cases, initiatives, and working groups promoting ideals and celebrating victories of human rights initiatives and the [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]. Currently, human rights advocacy groups are working diligently to fine-tune rules, regulations and implementation schemes; little news of complaint successes or failures is available.&lt;ref&gt;“Campaign for the Ratification and Implementation of the Optional Protocol to the ICESCR-Justice NOW! Ratify to protect all Human Rights.” ESCR-Net Newsletter December (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions ([[COHRE]]) has helped to establish the [[Housing and Property Directorate]] (HPD/HPCC) in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hassine, Regularizing Property Rights in Kosovo and Elsewhere, 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-86553-340-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory of rights ==
According to [[Karel Vasak]]'s theory of [[three generations of human rights]], economic, social and cultural rights are considered second-generation rights, while [[civil and political rights]], such as [[freedom of speech]], [[right to a fair trial]], and the [[right to vote]], are considered first-generation rights.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Vasak, "Human Rights: A Thirty-Year Struggle: the Sustained Efforts to give Force of law to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights", ''UNESCO Courier'' 30:11, Paris: [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]], November 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[negative and positive rights]] considers economic, social and cultural rights [[positive rights]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

'''El Castillo''' ({{IPA-es|el kas'tiʎo}}, Spanish for "the castle"), also known as the '''Temple of Kukulcan''' (or sometimes '''Kukulkan'''), is a [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Mesoamerican step-pyramid]] that dominates the center of the [[Chichen Itza]] archaeological site in the Mexican [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]. The building is more formally designated by archaeologists as Chichen Itza '''Structure 5B18'''.

Built by the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] sometime between the 9th and 12th centuries CE, El Castillo served as a temple to the god [[Kukulkan]], the Yucatec Maya [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|Feathered Serpent deity]] closely related to the god [[Quetzalcoatl]] known to the [[Aztec]]s and other central Mexican cultures of the [[Postclassic period]].

The pyramid consists of a series of square terraces with stairways up each of the four sides to the temple on top. Sculptures of plumed serpents run down the sides of the northern balustrade. Around the [[spring equinox|spring]] and [[autumn equinox]]es, the late afternoon sun strikes off the northwest corner of the pyramid and casts a series of triangular shadows against the northwest balustrade, creating the illusion of a feathered serpent "crawling" down the pyramid. The event has been very popular and is witnessed by thousands of visitors at the spring equinox, but it is questionable whether it is a result of a purposeful design, because the light-and-shadow effect can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=El Sol en Chichén Itzá y Dzibilchaltún: la supuesta importancia de los equinoccios en Mesoamérica |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=XXV |issue=149 |pages=26-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the pyramid's four sides has 91 steps which, when added together and including the temple platform on top as the final "step", produces a total of 365 steps (which is equal to the number of days of the ''[[Haab']]'' year).&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath 1989: 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure is {{convert|24|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, plus an additional {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} for the temple. The square base measures {{convert|55.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} across.

==Construction==
The construction of El Castillo, like other Mesoamerican pyramids, likely reflected the common practice of executing several phases of construction. The last construction probably took place between 900-1000 CE, while the substructure may have been constructed between 600-800 AD. Based on archaeological research, construction of El Castillo was based on the concept of ''[[axis mundi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the space remained sacred regardless of the structure positioned on the location. When a temple or pyramid structure was renewed, the former construction was ritually destroyed, which involved resolving the space of spiritual forces to preserve its sacredness.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that this construction dates to the [[eleventh century]] CE. After all of the work was completed, an entryway was cut into the balustrade of the northeastern exterior staircase to provide access to tourists. The older, inner pyramid is referred to as the "substructure".

==Inside the pyramid==
In 1566, the pyramid was described by Friar [[Diego de Landa]] in the manuscript known as Yucatán at the Time of the Spanish Encounter ([[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]). Almost three centuries later, [[John Lloyd Stephens]] described with even more detail the architecture of the pyramid in his book Incidents of Travel in Yucatán (Incidentes del viaje Yucatán), published in 1843. At that time, the archaeological site of [[Chichén Itzá]] was located on an estate, also called [[Chichén Itzá]], owned by Juan Sosa. [[Frederick Catherwood]] illustrated the book with lithographs depicting the pyramid covered in abundant vegetation on all sides. There are some photographs taken in the beginning of the 20th century that also show the pyramid partially covered by said vegetation.

In 1924, the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]] in Washington, D.C. requested permission from the Mexican government to carry out explorations and restoration efforts in and around the area of [[Chichen Itza]]. In 1927, with the assistance of Mexican archaeologists, they started the task. In April 1931, looking to confirm the hypothesis that the structure of the pyramid of Kukulkan was built on top of a much older pyramid, the work of excavation and exploration began in spite of generalized beliefs contrary to that hypothesis. On June 7, 1932, a box with coral, obsidian, and turquoise encrusted objects was found alongside human remains, which are exhibited in the [[National Anthropology Museum]] in Mexico City.

El Castillo is located above a cavity filled with water, labeled a sinkhole or [[cenote]]. Recent archaeological investigations suggest that an earlier construction phase is located closer to the south-east cenote, rather than being centered.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; This specific proximity to the cenote suggests that the Maya may have been aware of the cenote’s existence and purposefully constructed there to facilitate their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After extensive work, in April 1935, a [[Chac Mool]] statue, with its nails, teeth, and eyes inlaid with [[mother of pearl]] was found inside the pyramid. The room where the discovery was made was nicknamed the "Hall of offerings" or "North Chamber". After more than a year of excavation, in August 1936, a second room was found, only meters away from the first. Inside this room, dubbed the "Chamber of Sacrifices", archaeologists found two parallel rows of human bone set into the back wall, as well as a red [[jaguar]] statue. Both deposits of human remains were found oriented north-northeast. Researchers concluded that there must be an inner pyramid approximately {{convert|33|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, shaped similarly to the outer pyramid, with nine steps and a height of {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} up to the base of the temple where the Chac Mool and the jaguar were found.

The discovery of what appears to be a throne (referred to as the "Red Jaguar") in the throne room was previously assumed to have been decorated with flint and green stone discs, but recent research has determined the jaguar to be composed of highly symbolic and valued materials for ritualistic significance. The use of x-ray fluorescence (pXRF) was used to determine that the sculpture is painted red with a pigment that includes [[cinnabar]], or mercury sulfide (HgS)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Cinnabar was not in accessible proximity to Chichén Itzá, so the transportation of this pigment through long-distance trade placed a high value of this product.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the color red appears to be significant to Maya symbolism, and it is associated with creating life as well as death and sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that objects in Maya culture were imbued with vital essence, so the choice of painting the jaguar red may be a reflection of these beliefs, deeming the jaguar as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; The high-status associated with the cinnabar pigment and its red tone suggest that the jaguar was linked to ritual importance of closing a temple for renewal.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The four fangs of the Red Jaguar have been identified as gastropod mollusk shells (''[[Lobatus costatus]]'') using a digital microscope  and comparative analysis from [[malacology]] experts from the National Institute of Anthropology and History, another valued resource that may have been traded into Chichén Itzá.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; The green stones were also analyzed and determined to be a form of jadeite.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; Jadeite was valuable economically and socially, and the acquisition and application of the material is indicative of the access Chichén Itzá had along its trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological studies indicate that the Red Jaguar is similar to other depictions of thrones found in murals (Temple of [[Chacmool]]), thus whomever was seated on this throne could have been accessing the point of ''axis mundi'', which is essential to the elements and relationship to the cosmological system.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbolic usage of materials related to the underworld and death also suggest that it acted as an offering for ritually closing the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Juárez-Rodríguez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ramírez, M., &amp; López-García, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chichén Itzá, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alignment==


The location of the pyramid is aligned at the intersection between four cenotes: the Sacred Cenote, Xtoloc, Kanjuyum, and Holtún. This alignment supports the position of El Castillo as an ''axis mundi''.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The western and eastern sides of the temple are angled to the zenith sunset and nadir sunrise, which may correspond with other calendar events such as start of the traditional planting and harvesting seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Wren, L., Kristan-Graham, C., Nygard, T., &amp; Spencer, K. R. (2018). Landscapes of the Itza : Archaeology and art history at Chichen Itza and neighboring sites. Gainesville: University Press of Florida.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the approximate correspondence with the Sun's positions on its zenith and nadir passages is likely coincidental, because very few Mesoamerican orientations match these events and even for such cases a different explanation is much more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Zenith and nadir passages of the Sun in Mesoamerica |journal=Journal of Skyscape Archaeology |date=2018 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=108–117 |doi=10.1558/jsa.36092 |url=https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/JSA/article/viewFile/36092/32903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the sunrise and sunset dates recorded by solar orientations, which prevail in Mesoamerican architecture, tend to be separated by multiples of 13 and 20 days (i.e. of basic periods of the calendrical system), and given their clustering in certain seasons of the year, it has been argued that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars intended to facilitate a proper scheduling of agricultural and related ritual activities. In agreement with this pattern, detected both in the Maya Lowlands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sánchez Nava |first1=Pedro Francisco |last2=Šprajc |first2=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas |date=2015 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-607-484-727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere in Mesoamerica,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica |journal=Journal of Archaeological Research |date=2018 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=197–251 |doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; the north (and main) face of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá has an azimuth of 111.72°, corresponding to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, separated by 65 and 300 days (multiples of 13 and 20). Significantly, the same dates are recorded by El Castillo at Tulum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Astronomía en la arquitectura de Chichén Itzá: una reevaluación |journal=Estudios de Cultura Maya |date=2013 |volume=XLI |pages=31-60 |doi=10.19130/iifl.ecm.2013.41.153 |url=https://revistas-filologicas.unam.mx/estudios-cultura-maya/index.php/ecm/article/view/153/154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
In recent years, the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] (INAH), which manages the archaeological site of Chichen Itza, has been closing monuments to public. While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers. Climbing El Castillo was stopped in 2006, after a woman fell to her death. At the same time INAH closed the public access to the interior throne room.&lt;ref&gt;Diario de Yucatan, "Fin a una exención para los mexicanos: Pagarán el día del equinoccio en la zona arqueológica," March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today "El Castillo" is one of the most recognized and widely visited pre-Columbian structures in present-day Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999: 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, researchers have discovered an enormous cenote (also known as a sinkhole) beneath the 1,000-year-old temple of Kulkulkan. The forming sinkhole beneath the temple is around {{convert|82|by|114|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} and up to {{convert|65|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. The water filling the cavern is thought to run from north to south.

Researchers also found a layer of limestone about {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} thick at the top of the cenote, on which the pyramid is sitting.

Recent archaeological investigations have utilized [[Electrical Resistivity Tomography]] (ERT) to examine the construction sequence of El Castillo.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve the site from potential damage, electrodes were placed non-traditionally as flat-based detectors around the quadrangle of the pyramid bodies of the pyramid. After each pyramidal body was tested, the data revealed two previous construction phases within El Castillo with a possible temple at the top of the second substructure. Determining the dates of when these constructions happened will provide time periods of when Chichen Itza may have been significantly occupied.&lt;ref&gt;Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hernández-Quintero, E., Chávez, R.E., &amp; García-Serrano, A. (2018). ‘Illuminating’ the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chichén Itzá, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Chanal''' is an [[archaeological site]] located at El Chanal town, {{Convert|4|km}} north of the [[Colima City]], [[Mexico]].  Based on its extension, over {{Convert|50|ha}}, it is probable that it was the largest settlement of the [[Colima]] state; it developed on both banks of the “Río Verde” or Río Colima. This archeological zone is maintained by the people of El Chanal. The area may have been inhabited by native groups around 1300 BC, achieving its maximum splendor between 1100 and 1400 CE.&lt;ref name= "  Arturo" &gt;{{cite journal |last= Cháirez |first=   Arturo |date=  |title= El Chanal (Colima) |trans-title=El Chanal (Colima)   |journal=  Mexico desconocido |location=  |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-chanal-colima.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a Nahuatl connection shown by archaeological materials representing deities such as [[Tláloc]] and [[Ehécatl]].&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Architectonically, the Chanal used the double temple concept, palaces with portals, ceremonial spaces with Mesoamerican ballgame, sidewalk-altar and altar-platform. Ceramics found indicates the massive use of braziers and “sahumerios” (used to burn Copal resin), associated with ceremonial rituals.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Some polychromatic images recreate divine attributes, observed in stone reliefs which have made this site somewhat famous.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Obviously there are many unknowns about the solemnity and majesty that surround the ceremonial spaces. But what we do know is that the whole town is and archeological zone that more treasures might found there. About the daily life in neighborhoods and community spaces, and all events that built this great city. A scientific investigation and formal exploration of this important site is indeed needed.

==The name==
The name of the site is related to imaginary beings known as "chanos" that inhabited water streams. From the many [[Tlaloc]] (rain god) representations in the region, it is likely that the El Chanal, was a remembrance of the myths probably associated with Tlaloc worship.&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correa Fuentes |first=Dora A. |date= |title=Página web zona arqueológica El Chanal |trans-title=El Chanal archaeological site web page |journal=[[INAH]] |location=Mexico |url=http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za00602.htm |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a version that relates El Chanal with “Place inhabited by water custodians”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=  Ma.

In the Mexican State of Chiapas, is a municipality with the same name, according to the municipalities encyclopedia of Mexico, the “Chanal” name means "wise man that teaches".&lt;ref name=Muni&gt;{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Denominación Chanal|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/chiapas/municipios/07024a.htm|publisher=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México|location=Chanal, Chiapas  State|language=Spanish|trans-title=Chanal Denomination|year=|accessdate=September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518004410/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/chiapas/municipios/07024a.htm|archivedate=2011-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The ethnic background of the site inhabitants has yet to be determined; ceramic materials found are not easily associated with the Colima ceramic tradition.

It is considered that site had artisan groups that knew metallurgical techniques. The presence of metal associated with plumbate vessels, used obsidian, manufactured clay sculptures with figures of “Xantiles” and [[Xipe Totec]] seem an indication that El Chanal was inhabited by a group, somehow related with [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Unfortunately, the Colima prehispanic ceramic was subject of theft and illegal trade, some pieces are in museums abroad.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

== The site ==
[[File:Ollinchanal.JPG|300px|thumb|Ollín Petroglyph.]]
The site has ceremonial spaces, plazas, central altars, and ballgame courts. In 1945 the site was explored by archaeologist Vladimiro Rosado Ojeda, who discovered a pyramid with remains of a stairway and bas-relief engraved steps. The motifs had 36 tablets (Nine per step) that displayed Gods images such as [[Tlaloc]] and [[Ehécatl]].  Among the structures are the Ossuary, the Pyramid and the Great Platform

The north-south slope that characterizes the Colima valley was advantageously used by the Chanal constructors; the town was arranged following its contour.

The pyramidal structures were built using rounded stone from nearby rivers beds. Some of the stones have petroglyphs with animal figures, plants and possible deities.&lt;ref name=Arturo /&gt;

El Chanal has six plazas or important ceremonial centers:

=== Altars Plaza ===
Include two altars, one of rectangular shape, very deteriorated and other is circular, where several burials were found.

=== Ballgame court ===
[[File:Estructurachanal.JPG|300px|thumb|Pyramidal Structure.]]
Located south of the “Plaza del Tiempo”, separated by a corridor, measures 38 by 13.5 meters.

The presence of a [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] court in the south of the archaeological site as part of ceremonial spaces is evidence of the strong religious life of the site. The cosmic sense of the town allowed battles by deities to culminate at the court, that fought day after day and allowed the reign of day and night and, hence the construction of the “Time Plaza”, include in the northeast the “Day and Night” Plaza and the “Water Plaza” at the northwest. The game deity was [[Xolotl]] that accompanied the sun in its passage through the underworld and announced its success over darkness by means of Venus, the morning star. The game rules, played by men, featured, a fundamental character for the world future. It is very probable that human sacrifice contemplated the magic that allowed supporting the fight of the light against the darkness.

===Plaza del Día y la Noche===
“Day and Night Plaza” Represents a large open space 60 by 80 meters, delimited to the south by a retaining wall; to the west is structure 2 and to the east is structure1.

The acute El Chanal settler’s religiosity is evident in the magnificent ritual and ceremonial spaces. There are two essential elements: The temples, represented by these native groups of western Mexico, are the home of gods on earth; and the plazas, as congregation spaces for the faithful masses. Some temples had public functions and were accessed by ample entrances. Others, however, had restricted entrances to which only the religious and civil authorities could enter. A way to describe and learn what their use was is by observing the type of materials used associated with the temples. In relation to the ample platform, it had on top two wooden rooms with roofs made of perishable materials, it is possible they used “sahumerios” and small incense dispensers. It is therefore probable, that the place was visited with the purpose of burning incense such as [[Copal]], and render individual and simple tributes to the Gods.

=== Plaza del Tiempo ===
The “Time Plaza” contains the most impressive site buildings: structures 1 and 3.

====Structure 1====

====Structure 2====
Composed by two bodies in the west side and three in the east.

=== Plaza del Agua ===
The “Water Plaza” is made up of a series of low platforms with inner patios, corridors and open plazas.

=== Patio alto ===
The “High Patio” corresponds to the residential housing area of the site.

=== Plaza del Altar ===
The round “Altar Plaza” visually dominates the plazas of Altars and Time.

'''Ewloe Castle''' ({{lang-cy|Castell Ewlo}}) is a native [[Castle|Welsh castle]] built by the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] near the town of [[Ewloe]] in [[Flintshire]], [[Wales]]. The castle, which was one of the last fortifications to be built by the native [[Prince of Wales|Princes of Wales]], was abandoned at the beginning of the [[Welsh Wars|invasion of Wales]] by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1277. Its construction, using locally quarried [[sandstone]], appears to have continued piecemeal over many years and may have not been completed. On taking the castle, the [[The Crown|English Crown]] gave it little military value and allowed it to fall into ruin.

Ewloe was sited on high ground within [[Tegeingl]], a [[cantref]] in the [[Perfeddwlad|lands of North East Wales]] ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Perfeddwlad''). Standing near the [[Chester]] road, it maintained a strategic position near the [[England–Wales border|Wales–England border]]. The castle is located on a steeply-sloped [[promontory]] within a forested valley. It overlooks the junction of two streams with higher ground to the south. 

==Layout==
Ewloe Castle combines features from both [[motte-and-bailey]] and earlier enclosure castles. An asymmetrical [[curtain wall (castle)|curtain wall]] – with [[parapet]]s – encloses two courtyards. A rock-cut [[neck ditch]] defends the southern side of the castle. In the upper triangular [[Ward (castle)|inner ward]] is a [[Fortified tower|D-shaped tower]] known as the "Welsh [[keep]]". This stands on a stone outcrop that forms the motte; it has a stone [[revetment]] around its base (a basic [[Chemise (wall)|Chemise]]). The lower [[Ward (castle)|outer ward]] is enclosed by two separate sections of wall that meet at a circular [[fortified tower]], which stands upon a rocky [[hillock|knoll]]. As the curtain walls are not joined together, ladders would have had to be used to reach their parapets.

No gateways connect the inner ward to the outer courtyard. Access into Ewloe Castle was entirely via wooden ramps. The outer ward had several wooden buildings. An external [[Earthworks (engineering)|defensive rampart]] occupies the higher ground to the south of the castle above the neck ditch.

Within the inner ward is a D-shaped (or horseshoe-shaped) tower known as the "Welsh Keep". Although a flight of stairs lead up to a first floor gateway – a similarity shared with contemporary [[Romanesque secular and domestic architecture#Keeps|military architecture]], the shape of the tower does not conform with keeps of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet period]]. D-shaped towers usually projected out from a wall or [[gatehouse]] but at Ewloe the castle builders placed the tower/keep on a motte in the upper ward surrounded by its own curtain wall. This feature has precedence in Welsh military architecture. [[Llywelyn the Great]] built a similar D-shaped tower at [[Castell y Bere]] at [[Llanfihangel-y-pennant]] in Gwynedd in the 1220s.

The tower's outer walls – which are {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} at their base – rose to about {{convert|11|m|abbr=on}}. They were higher than the upper storey to protect its pitched roof from projectiles. A parapet ran around the top of the tower. Spaces in the stonework show where storage slots were placed in the upper roof spaces. The tower had a single first floor hall that stood above a lower ground floor chamber. Defensive [[arrowslit]]s were placed on the curved sides of the tower. The flat side, which overlooks the outer ward, has a Romanesque window.

==History==
===Background===
Ewloe Castle, which was built around 1257, is a relic of a brief triumph that the Welsh prince [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] had over the [[The Crown|English Crown]] and the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[Marcher Lord]]s in the mid 13th century. Until then, this part of north east Wales had been the starting point for repeated [[Norman invasion of Wales|Norman invasions of Gwynedd]] for more than 150 years.

But beginning in the early 1230s, the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Princes of Gwynedd]] had had started to gain the upper hand against the [[Earl of Chester|Anglo-Normans]] and [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenets]] who had taken territory in North Wales. Eventually by the late 1250s, the Welsh had reached Ewloe retaking lands up to the [[England–Wales border]]. A fortification had existed on or near the site since the [[Battle of Ewloe]] ({{lang-cy|Brwydr Cwnsyllt}}) in 1157, when the Welsh successfully ambushed an English force under the command of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (as they marched to [[Twthill, Rhuddlan|Twthill]] at [[Rhuddlan]]). The English king only narrowly avoiding being killed himself having been rescued by [[Roger de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford|Roger, Earl of Hertford]].

===Construction===
In 1257 Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had work begin on the castle. The fortification incorporated previous work undertaken by both [[Owain Gwynedd]] and [[Llywelyn the Great]]. It was built from locally quarried  sandstone. There are no records to say when construction ended, however, its design – such as the D-shaped Welsh Keep – suggest it was conceived and built entirely by a Welsh workforce. Debate varies on whether Ewloe was intended to be an actual defensive fortification or a hunting lodge for Welsh nobility.&lt;ref name="castle"/&gt;

===Demise===  
In July 1277, Edward I began the [[Welsh Wars|first Welsh War]] by marching his forces out of the [[Chester Castle|castle]] at [[Chester]] and up the west coast of the [[Dee Estuary]]. After an advanced base was established at [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]] (a day's travel from Chester), building work immediately began on [[Flint Castle]]. Ewloe Castle is not mentioned in chronicles of the 1277 invasion suggesting the Welsh had abandoned the area; retreating to stronger defensive positions along the [[Clwydian Range|Clwydian Hills]] further to the west.

As [[Edward I]]'s castles at Flint and [[Rhuddlan Castle|Rhuddlan]] could be provisioned by sea, Ewloe was never used by the English military.

The only contemporary reference to the Ewloe Castle is in the [[Chester]] ''Plea Rolls'' that mentions a report sent to [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] in 1311. The [[Justice of Chester]] wrote to the King regarding the history of the manor at Ewloe from the middle of the 12th century. The rolls record that by 1257 Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had regained Ewloe from the English and built a castle in the wood; noting in 1311 that much of the castle was still standing.

By the late medieval period, the site was in ruins. Much of the castle's [[ashlar|dressed stone work]] from its [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]s and Keep were removed for construction material around [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] and [[Connah's Quay]].

==Preservation==
Ewloe Castle, which is a [[Grade I listed buildings in Flintshire|Grade I listed building]], is incorporated within [[Wepre Park]]; a [[country park]] managed by [[Flintshire County Council]]. The castle is under the care of [[Cadw]] – the national heritage agency for Wales. It can be reached by footpaths through Wepre Woods. Public access is free.

In November 2009, the castle was among five lots of farmland and woodland put up for sale by Flintshire County Council. The local authority stressed Ewloe and the site it occupies were protected from any development.&lt;ref name="castle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/8364611.stm|title=13th-Century castle is to be sold|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2009-11-18|accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold at auction to an anonymous farmer along with {{convert|24|acre|abbr=on}} of surrounding land for £122,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/local-news/ewloe-castle-sold-farmer-auction-2770922|title=Ewloe Castle has sold to farmer at auction | newspaper=[[North Wales Daily Post|Daily Post]]|date=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lieutenant Colonel]] '''Sir Francis Edward Younghusband''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCSI|KCIE}} (31 May 1863 &amp;ndash; 31 July 1942) was a [[British Army]] officer, [[List of explorers|explorer]], and spiritual writer. He is remembered for his travels in the [[Far East]] and [[Central Asia]]; especially the [[British expedition to Tibet|1904 British expedition]] to [[Tibet]], led by him, and for his writings on Asia and foreign policy. Younghusband held positions including British commissioner to Tibet and President of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].

== Early life ==
Francis Younghusband was born in 1863 at [[Murree]], [[British India]] (now Pakistan), to a British military family, being the brother of Major-General [[George Younghusband]] and the second son of Major-General John W. Younghusband&lt;ref name="IndianBio" /&gt; and his wife Clara Jane Shaw. Clara's brother, [[Robert Barkley Shaw|Robert Shaw]], was a noted explorer of [[Central Asia]]. His uncle Lieutenant-General [[Charles Younghusband]] CB FRS, was a British Army officer and meteorologist.

As an infant, Francis was taken to live in England by his mother. When Clara returned to India in 1867 she left her son in the care of two austere and strictly religious aunts. In 1870 his mother and father returned to England and reunited the family. In 1876 at age thirteen, Francis entered [[Clifton College]], [[Bristol]]. In 1881 he entered the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and was commissioned as a [[Subaltern (rank)|subaltern]] in the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards]] in 1882.&lt;ref name="IndianBio" /&gt;

== Military career ==
[[File:Long White Mountain - p235 - Interior of an inn.png|thumb|left|A one-room inn in a then-wild area east of [[Tonghua]], [[Jilin Province|Jilin]], where Younghusband and his companions stayed in 1887&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1887|pp=235–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Having read [[Charles MacGregor|General MacGregor]]'s book ''Defence of India'' he could have justifiably called himself an expert on the "[[The Great Game|Great Game]]" of espionage that was unfolding on the Steppes of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;General Sir C MacGregor, The Defence of India, (Simla, 1884)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1886-1887, on leave from his regiment, Younghusband made an expedition across Asia though still a young officer.  Sailing to China his party set out with Colonel Mark Bell's permission to cross 1200 miles of desert with the ostensible authority to survey the geography; but in reality the purposes were to ascertain the strength of the Russian physical threats to the Raj.  Departing Peking with a senior colleague, [[H. E. M. James|Henry E. M. James]] (on leave from his [[Indian Civil Service]] position) and a young British consular officer from [[Newchwang]], [[Harry English Fulford]], on April 4, 1887, Lieut Younghusband explored [[Manchuria]], visiting the frontier areas of [[Chuang Guandong|Chinese settlement]] in the region of the [[Changbai Mountains]].&lt;ref name=yh1896/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Sir Henry Evan Murchison |last=James|authorlink=Evan James (civil servant) | publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co. |year=1888|title=The Long White Mountain, or, A journey in Manchuria: with some account of the history, people, administration and religion of that country|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4bICAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On arrival in India he was granted three months leave by the C-in-C [[Field Marshal Lord Roberts]]; the scientific results of this travel would prove vital information to the [[Royal Geographical Society|RGS]].  Younghusband had already carried out numerous scientific observation (in particular, showing that the [[Changbai Mountains]]'s highest peak, [[Baekdu Mountain]] is only around 8,000 feet tall, even though the British maps the travelers had showed [nonexistent] snow-capped peaks 10,000-12,000&amp;nbsp;ft tall in the area&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|pp=254,262}})&lt;/ref&gt;), while Fulford was providing the travelers with a language and cultural expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|pp=125,217}})&lt;/ref&gt; Younghusband crossed the most inhospitable terrain in the world to the Himalayas before being ordered to make his way home.  Parting with his British companions, Younghusband then crossed the [[Taklamakan Desert]] to the [[Chinese Turkestan]], and pioneered a route from [[Kashgar]] to [[India]] through the uncharted [[Mustagh Pass]].&lt;ref name=yh1896&gt;Younghusband, Francis E. (1896). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Avk88OI8bQkC The Heart of a Continent]'', pp. 58-290. John Murray, London. Facsimile reprint: (2005) Elbiron Classics.&lt;/ref&gt;  He reported to the Viceroy, [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]] his crossing through the Karakoram Range, the Hindu Kush, Pamirs where the range converged with the Himalayas; the nexus of three great empires.  In the 1880s the region of the Upper Oxus was still largely unmapped.  For this achievement, aged still only 24 he was elected the youngest member of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and received the society's 1890 [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]].

[[Image:Younghusband PekingToYarkand Map.jpg|thumb|450px|right|"From Peking To Yarkand and Kashmir via the Mustagh Pass"]]
In 1889,  he made captain, and was dispatched with a small escort of [[Gurkha]] soldiers to investigate an uncharted region north of [[Ladakh]], where raiders from [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] had disrupted trade between [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] and India the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;''The Heart of a Continent'', pp. 186ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst encamped in the valley of the [[Yarkand River]], Younghusband received a messenger at his camp, inviting him to dinner with Captain [[Bronislav Grombchevsky]], his Russian counterpart in "The Great Game". Younghusband accepted the invitation to Grombchevsky's camp, and after dinner the two rivals talked into the night, sharing brandy and vodka, and discussing the possibility of a Russian invasion of British India. Grombchevsky impressed Younghusband with the horsemanship skills of his [[Cossack]] escort, and Younghusband impressed Grombchevsky with the rifle drill of his Gurkhas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Heart of a Continent'', pp. 234ff&lt;/ref&gt; After their meeting in this remote frontier region, Grombchevsky resumed his expedition in the direction of [[Tibet]] and Younghusband continued his exploration of the [[Karakoram]].

Younghusband received a telegram from Simla, to attend the Intelligence Department (ID) to be interviewed by Foreign Secretary, [[Sir Mortimer Durand]] transferred to the [[Indian Political Service]].  He served as a political officer on secondment from the British Army.  He refused a request to visit Lhasa as an interpreter, disguised as a Yarkandi trader, a cover not guaranteed to fool the Russians, after Scots merchant, [[Andrew Dalgleish]] had been brutally hacked to death.  Younghusband was accompanied by a Gurkha escort, celebrated for their ferocity in combat.  The Forward policy was circumscribed by a legal offer to all travellers of a peaceable security crossing borders.  Departure from [[Leh]] on 8 August 1889 on the caravan route took them up the mountain pass of [[Shimshal]] towards Hunza; his aim being to restore the tea trade to Xinjiang and prevent any further raids into Kashmir.  Colonel Durand from [[Gilgit]] joined him.  Younghusband probed the villages to gauge the reception: calculating it was a den of thieves, they ascended the steep ravine.  The Hunza was barred to them, a trap was sprung; the parley terms took him inside to negotiate.  The nervous reception over, they were all relieved to find safety; Younghusband wanted to know why and who was way-laying innocent civilian traders?  The ruler, [[Safdar Ali]] extended a letter of welcome to his Kashmiri kingdom; the British investigated from whence came the Russian infiltrators under Agent Gromchevsky. Further south at [[Ladakh]], he kept close watch on their movements. Reluctantly, Younghusband dined with the Cossack leaders who divulged the secrets of their common rivalry. Gromchevsky explained that the Raj had invited enmity for meddling in the Black Sea ports. The Russian displayed little grasp of strategy, but basic raw courage; he betrayed the confidence of [[Abdul Rahman]] as no friend to the British. Younghusband tentatively concluded that their possessions at Bokhara and Samarkand were vulnerable. Having drunk large quantities of vodka and brandy, the Cossacks presented arms in cordial salute and they parted in peace. Woefully unprepared for winter, the British garrison at Ladakh refused them entry.

Younghusband finally arrived at [[Gulmit]] to a 13-gun salute. In khaki, the envoy greeted [[Safdar Ali]] at the marquee on the Karakoram Highway, the men of Hunza kneeling at their ruler's feet. This was colonial diplomacy, based on protocol and etiquette, but Younghusband had not come for merely trivial discussions. Reinforced by Durand's troops, Younghusband's arguments were to prevent the criminal looting, murder and highway robbery. Impervious to reason though he was, Younghusband was not prepared to allow Safdar Ali to laugh at the Raj. A demonstration of firepower "caused quite a sensation" he wrote in his diaries. The British major was disdainful, but content when he left on November 23, to return to India, which he reached by Christmas.

In 1890, Younghusband was sent on a mission to [[Chinese Turkestan]], accompanied by [[George Macartney (British consul)|George Macartney]] as interpreter. He spent the winter in [[Kashgar]], where he left Macartney as British consul.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of National Biography ''Sir George Macartney''&lt;/ref&gt; Younghusband wanted to investigate the Pamir Gap, a possible Russian entry route to India. But he had had to ensure the Chinese at Kashgar were sorted out to prevent a tripartite attempt by the Hunza clans. It was for this reason he recruited a Mandarin-interpreter, junior officer, George Macartney to accompany his missions into the frozen mountains. They wintered in Kashgar, as a listening post: meeting in conference with the Russian [[Nikolai Petrovsky]], who had always resisted trade with Xinjiang ([[Sinkiang]]). The Russian agent was well-informed about British India, but proved unscrupulous. Believing he had succeeded, Younghusband did not reckon on Petrovsky's deal with the ''[[Taotai]],'' the Chinese governor of Hunza.

In July 1891, they were still in the Pamirs when news reached them the Russians intended to send troops "to note and report with the Chinese and Afghans". At [[Bozai Gumbaz]] in the [[Little Pamir]] on 12 August he encountered Cossack soldiers, who forced him to leave the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Riddick | first = John | title = The history of British India | year = 2006 | page=82 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Es6x4u_g19UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Riddick&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q | isbn = 978-0-313-32280-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the incidents which provoked the [[Hunza-Nagar Campaign]]. The troop of 20 or so soldiers planted a flag on what they anticipated was unclaimed territory, 150 miles south of the Russian border. But to the British the area was Afghan territory. Colonel [[:ru:Ионов, Михаил Ефремович|Yonov]], decorated with the [[Order of St George]], approached his camp to announce that the area now belonged to the Tsar. Younghusband learnt that they had raided the [[Chitral]] territory; furthermore they had penetrated the [[Darkot Pass]] into the [[Yasin Valley]]. They were joined by eager intelligence officer Lieutenant Davison; but the British were disabused by Ivanov of British sovereignty: Younghusband remained polite, maintained protocol but hospitable to the big Russian bear hug.

During his service in Kashmir, he wrote a book called '''Kashmir''' at the request of [[Edward Molyneux]]. Younghusband's descriptions went hand in glove with Molyneux's paintings of the valley. In the book, Younghusband declared his immense admiration of the natural beauty of Kashmir and its history. The Great Game, between Britain and Russia, continued beyond the start of the 20th century until officially ended by the 1907 Anglo-Russian Treaty. Younghusband, among other explorers such as [[Sven Hedin]], [[Nikolay Przhevalsky]], [[Shoqan Walikhanov]] and [[Aurel Stein|Sir Auriel Stein]], had participated in earnest.&lt;ref name="Nalle"&gt;{{cite journal|author=David Nalle |date=June 2000 |title=Book Review&amp;nbsp;– Tournament of Shadows: The Great Game and the Race for Empire in Central Asia |journal=[[Middle East Policy]] |volume= VII |issue=3 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Washington DC |issn=1061-1924 |url=http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol7/0006_nalle.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601233205/http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol7/0006_nalle.asp |archivedate=1 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours of Russian expansion into the [[Hindu Kush]] with a Russian presence in Tibet prompted the new [[Viceroy of India]] [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] to appoint Younghusband, by then a major, British commissioner to Tibet from 1902-1904.

=== Invasion of Tibet and massacre at Guru ===
In 1903, Curzon appointed Younghusband head of the [[Tibet Frontier Commission]] with [[John Claude White]], political officer of [[Sikkim]], and [[E. C. Wilton]] as deputy commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick French|title=Younghusband: The Last Great Imperial Adventurer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENfKlCIqAxoC|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-196430-0|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently led the 1903-04 [[British expedition to Tibet]], whose putative aim was to settle disputes over the [[Sikkim-Tibet border]]; the expedition by exceeding instructions from London, controversially became a ''de facto'' [[History of Tibet|invasion]] of Tibet.&lt;ref name="Younghusband"&gt;{{cite web|first= |title=Tibetans' fight against British invasion |publisher=En.Tibet.cn&amp;nbsp;– China Tibet Information Center |url=http://en.tibet.cn/history/tib/t20050309_14950.htm |accessdate=15 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103094834/http://en.tibet.cn/history/tib/t20050309_14950.htm |archivedate=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About {{convert|100|mi}} inside Tibet, on the way to [[Gyantse]], thence to the capital of [[Lhasa]], a confrontation outside the hamlet of Guru led to a victory by the expedition over 600-700 Tibetan militia, largely monks.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, James: ''Farewell the Trumpets'' (Faber &amp; Faber, 1979), p.102.&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates of Tibetan casualties are far higher; inciting other conflicts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Nick Heil]] |title=Dark Summit: The Extraordinary True Story of One of the Deadliest Seasons on Everest |url=http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/amit/books/heil-2008-dark-summit-extraordinary.html
|publisher=Virgin Books Ltd |date=2008 |page=54 |isbn=0-7535-1359-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younghusband's well-trained troops were armed with rifles and machine guns, confronting disorganized monks wielding hoes, swords, and flintlocks. Some accounts estimated that more than 5,000 Tibetans were killed during the campaign, while the total number of British casualties was about five.

The British force was supported by [[Ugyen Wangchuck|King Ugyen Wangchuck]] of [[Bhutan]], who was knighted in return for his services. The incident, portrayed by Chinese sources as a "massacre", embarrassed the British Government, which desired good relations with China for the sake of the coastal Chinese trade. Accordingly, the British repudiated the treaty known as the [[Treaty of Lhasa]] that Younghusband's services had obtained.

In 1891, Younghusband received the Companion of the [[Order of the Indian Empire]], which was upgraded to Knight Commander in 1904;&lt;ref name="IndianBio"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Indian Biographical Dictionary|editor=C. Hayavando Rao|publisher=Pillar &amp; Co.|location=Madras|year=1915|pages=470–71|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Indian_Biographical_Dictionary_%281915%29/Younghusband,_Lt.-Colonel_Sir_Francis_Edward|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1917, he was awarded the honour of Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Star of India]]. He was also awarded the [[Kaisar-I-Hind Medal]] (gold) in 1901&lt;ref name="IndianBio" /&gt; and the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rsgs.org/inspiring-people/medals-awards/scottish-geographical-medal/|title= Scottish Geographical Medal|publisher= Royal Scottish Geographical Society|accessdate = 26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, Younghusband settled in [[Kashmir]] as the British representative before returning to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], where he was an active member of many clubs and societies. In 1908, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. During the [[World War I|First World War]], his patriotic [[Fight for Right]] campaign commissioned the song [[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]].

== Himalaya and mountaineering ==
Younghusband was elected President of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1919, and two years later became Chairman of the [[Mount Everest Committee]] which was set up to coordinate the initial [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition]] to [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountain-portal.co.uk/text/everest/Evrst02.htm Text of ''The Epic of Mount Everest'', Sir Francis Younghusband.]&lt;/ref&gt; He actively encouraged the accomplished climber [[George Mallory]] to attempt the first ascent of Mount Everest, and they followed the same initial route as the earlier Tibet Mission. Younghusband remained Chairman through the subsequent [[1922 British Mount Everest expedition|1922]] and [[1924 British Mount Everest expedition|1924]] British Expeditions.

In 1938 Younghusband encouraged [[Ernst Schäfer]], who was about to lead a German expedition to "sneak over the border" when faced with British intransigence towards Schäfer's efforts to reach Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, Christopher. ''Himmler's Crusade'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003) pp. 149-151&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1897 Younghusband married Helen Augusta Magniac, the daughter of [[Charles Magniac]], MP. Augusta's brother, Vernon, served as Younghusband's private secretary during the expedition to Tibet.&lt;ref name = Fleming&gt;[[Peter Fleming (writer)|Fleming, Peter]] (2012). ''Bayonets to Lhasa - the British invasion of Tibet''. Tauris Parke, London. {{ISBN|9780857731432}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Younghusbands had a son who died in infancy, and a daughter, [[Eileen Younghusband (British social worker)|Eileen Younghusband]] (1902–1981), who became a prominent social worker.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1921 to 1937 the couple lived at Westerham, Kent, but Helen did not accompany her husband on his travels. In July 1942 Younghusband suffered a stroke after addressing a meeting of the World Congress of Faiths in Birmingham. He died of cardiac failure on 31 July 1942 at Madeline Lees' home Post Green House, at [[Lytchett Minster]], Dorset.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;Anon. 1942 Obituary: Sir Francis Edward Younghusband. Geographical Review 32(4):681&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the village churchyard.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

== Spiritual life ==
Biographer [[Patrick French]] described Younghusband's religious belief as one who was
&lt;blockquote&gt;brought up an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christian, read his way into [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoyan]] simplicity, experienced a revelatory vision in the mountains of Tibet, toyed with [[telepathy]] in [[Kashmir]], proposed a new faith based on virile [[racial theory]], then transformed it into what [[Bertrand Russell]] called 'a religion of [[atheism]].'&lt;ref&gt;French, p.313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Ultimately he became a spiritualist and "premature hippie" who "had great faith in the power of [[cosmic ray]]s, and claimed that there are extraterrestrials with translucent flesh on the planet [[Altair]]."&lt;ref&gt;French, p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 1904 retreat from Tibet, Younghusband had a mystical experience which suffused him with "love for the whole world" and convinced him that "men at heart are divine."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in French, p.252.&lt;/ref&gt; This conviction was tinged with regret for the invasion of Tibet, and eventually, in 1936, profound religious convictions invited a founder's address to the [[World Congress of Faiths]] (in imitation of the [[World Parliament of Religions]]). Younghusband published a number of books with what one might call [[New Age]] themes, with titles like ''The Gleam: Being an account of the life of Nija Svabhava, pseud.'' (1923); ''Mother World (in Travail for the Christ that is to be)'' (1924); and ''Life in the Stars: An Exposition of the View that on some Planets of some Stars exist Beings higher than Ourselves, and on one a World-Leader, the Supreme Embodiment of the Eternal Spirit which animates the Whole'' (1927). The last drew the admiration of Lord [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]], the Boy Scouts founder.&lt;ref&gt;French, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; Key concepts consisted of the central belief that would come to be known as the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[pantheism]], and a Christlike "world leader" living on the planet "Altair" (or "Stellair"), exploring the theology of spiritualism, and guidance by means of telepathy.

Younghusband allegedly believed in [[free love]] ("freedom to unite when and how a man and a woman please"), marriage laws examined as a matter of "outdated custom."&lt;ref&gt;French, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; One of Younghusband's domestic servants, [[Gladys Aylward]], became a Christian missionary in China.

=== Fictional portrayal ===
The [[Ingrid Bergman]] film ''[[The Inn of the Sixth Happiness]]'' (1958) is based on Gladys Aylward's life, with [[Ronald Squire]] portraying Younghusband.&lt;ref&gt;French., p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Gaza flotilla raid}}
On 3 June, in the aftermath of the [[Gaza flotilla raid]], activists revealed there was another Gaza-bound aid ship, the [[MV Rachel Corrie|MV ''Rachel Corrie'']]: this was expected to arrive in the region early the following week.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The vessel is a former merchant ship owned and operated by the Free Gaza Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=59331|title=Israel army says ready to attack another Gaza ship|work=World Bulletin|date=1 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612110605/http://worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=59331|archivedate=12 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was partially funded by the [[Perdana Global Peace Organisation]], a Malaysian NGO headed by former Malaysian prime minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aid ship Rachel Corrie, with 6 M'sians, presses on to Gaza |newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|''The Star'' (Malaysia)]] |date=1 June 2010 |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/6/1/nation/20100601105855&amp;sec=nation |accessdate=5 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604004141/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2010%2F6%2F1%2Fnation%2F20100601105855&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=4 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ship is Irish-owned, and had the former Assistant [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Denis Halliday]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Mairead Corrigan|Mairead Maguire]] on board. Halliday said that the ship would stop only when Israelis forced the ship to do so.&lt;ref name="CNN603"/&gt;

Passengers aboard the ''Rachel Corrie'' said that the purpose of their journey was to bring both humanitarian aid to the Gazan population and public attention to the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|Egypt-Israel blockade]] of the Gaza region; a blockade criticised by [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] for imposing "abject poverty" on 350,000 Gazans.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=41 | title=United Nations Relief and Works Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Former United Nations Assistant Secretary-General, [[Denis Halliday]], aboard the ''Rachel Corrie'', expressed concern that some of these humanitarian goods would likely be seized if the MV ''Rachel Corrie'' accepted "an offer of an escort to another port". The cargo, although it all falls within the remit of humanitarian aid as defined by the United Nations, "would be confiscated by the Israelis, given that they do not define this as humanitarian goods&amp;nbsp;– in breach of the UN definition of same".

'''Glospace SGK-70''' is the world's first [[Automotive navigation system]] that is able to navigate using both [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[GLONASS]] signals.

Glospace is a brand of НИИ КП ("Научно-исследовательский институт космического приборостроения", the Russian Institute of Space Device Engineering).

Its hardware part is based on 24 channel NAVIOR-24 (СН-4701) chip that handles signals of both systems (12 channels per each system). Its software part is based on ПалмГИСGPS (PalmGISGPS) that runs on Windows CE 5.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Graz''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡʁaːt͡s}}) is the capital of [[Styria]] and the [[List of cities and towns in Austria#List of cities and towns by population size|second-largest city]] in [[Austria]] after [[Vienna]]. On 1 January 2018, it had a population of 325,021 (of which 289,440 had principal residence status).&lt;ref name="grazpraes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.graz.at/Statistik/Bevölkerung/aktuelles_quartal.pdf|title=Anwesende Bevölkerung nach Wohnsitz und Gechlecht pro Bezirk – Stand 1.

Graz has a long tradition as seat of universities: its six universities have almost 60,000 students. Its historic centre is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interreg-central.eu/Content.Node/SOLEZ/Graz.html|title=City of Graz/Stadt Graz|website=Interreg CENTRAL EUROPE|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, Graz ({{Lang-sl|Gradec}}) was more important to [[Slovenes]], both politically and culturally, than the capital of [[Slovenia]], [[Ljubljana]], and it remains influential to this day.&lt;ref name="Granda"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://isn.zrc-sazu.si/files/file/Traditiones/Traditiones_35_2_Krek_separati/TR352%20099-103%20Granda.pdf |title=Gradec in Slovenci |language=sl |first=Stane |last=Granda |year=2006 |publisher=University of Graz |journal=Traditiones |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=99–103 |accessdate=17 December 2010&lt;!--(via Google Documents; [http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:KsSTt5sfY7UJ:isn.zrc-sazu.si/files/file/Traditiones/Traditiones_35_2_Krek_separati/TR352%2520099-103%2520Granda.pdf+granda+gradec+slovenci&amp;hl=sl&amp;gl=si&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiyiNKQdxVieE89s2c8irLJ_Y7pplCPGUZxciVC_ERHycwKkALq3zwFtoF_N3_9QCodJRCu9jYcEgBEKh5IvguAAAPkSCfW4p15qd_3FXs-cnfgEHFe8WgxsOsI-7vm3fWIyP8a&amp;sig=AHIEtbRJwxKwdl8G-BlsHzCdCpoCV95qxw])--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Graz was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]], and the site was extended in 2010 with [[Eggenberg Palace, Graz|Eggenberg Palace]] (German: Schloss Eggenberg). Graz was the sole [[Cultural Capital of Europe]] of 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.

==Etymology==
The name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled '''Gratz''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB9|wstitle= Gratz |volume= 11 |page= 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; most likely stems from the Slavic ''gradec'', "small castle". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by [[Alpine Slavs|Alpine Slavic]] people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In literary [[Slovene language|Slovene]], ''gradec'' still means "small castle", forming a [[hypocoristic]] derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *gradьcъ, whichs descends via [[liquid metathesis]] from [[Common Slavic]] *gardьcъ and via the Slavic third [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalisation]] from [[Proto-Slavic]] *gardiku, originally denoting "small town, settlement". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as ''[[Grad (Slavic settlement)|grad]]''. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128.

== Geography ==
[[File:Historic City Center of Graz.jpg|thumb|Aerial photography showing the historic centre of Graz]]
Graz is situated on the [[Mur (river)|Mur]] river in southeast Austria. It is about {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Vienna. The nearest larger [[urban centre]] is [[Maribor]] in Slovenia which is about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. Graz is the capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested area.

The oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the [[Copper Age]]. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.

During the 12th century, dukes under [[Babenberg]] rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the [[Habsburg]]s and, in 1281, gained special privileges from [[Rudolf I of Germany|King Rudolph I]].

In the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the [[Inner Austria]]n line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the [[Schlossberg (Graz)|Schlossberg]] castle and from there ruled [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy ([[Carniola]], [[Gorizia and Gradisca]], [[Trieste]]).

In the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings built in this style is the [[Landhaus]], designed by [[Domenico dell'Allio]], and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.

Karl-Franzens-Universität, also called the [[University of Graz]], is the city's oldest university, founded in 1585 by Archduke [[Charles II of Austria|Karl II]]. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic church]], and was closed in 1782 by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-instituted as a university by Emperor [[Franz I of Austria|Franz I]], thus gaining the name 'Karl-Franzens Universität,' meaning 'Charles-Francis University.' Over 30,000 students currently study at this university.

The astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] lived in Graz for a short period. There, he worked as a math teacher and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz to go to [[Prague]] when [[Lutheran]]s were banned from the city.

[[Ludwig Boltzmann]] was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, [[Nikola Tesla]] studied electrical engineering at the [[Graz University of Technology|Polytechnic]] in 1875. Nobel Laureate [[Otto Loewi]] taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. [[Ivo Andric]], the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. [[Erwin Schrödinger]] was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.

Graz lies in Styria, or ''Steiermark'' in German. ''Mark'' is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was often assaulted (unsuccessfully), e.g. by the Hungarians under [[Matthias Corvinus]] in 1481, and by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the [[Riegersburg Castle]], the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to [[Landeszeughaus|the region's provincial armory]], which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.

From the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of [[Emperor Ferdinand II]], who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Armée occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönbrunn]] of the same year. The belltower and the civic clock tower, often used as the symbol of Graz, were spared after the people of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.&lt;ref name="graz-sh"/&gt;

Archduke [[Charles II of Austria|Karl II]] of Inner Austria had 20,000 [[Protestant]] books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the [[Holy See]]. [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] was born in Graz, in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).

The more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.&lt;ref name="graz1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.graz.at/cms/beitrag/10034466/7772565/Zahlen_Fakten_Bevoelkerung_Bezirke_Wirtschaft.html |title=Zahlen + Fakten: Bevölkerung, Bezirke, Wirtschaft, Geografie |date=1 January 2017 |publisher=Stadt Graz – Magistratsdirektion, Abteilung für Öffentlichkeitsarbeit |accessdate=22 December 2017 |location=Graz |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stata1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.at/blickgem/blick1/g60101.pdf|title=Ein Blick auf die Gemeinde Graz &lt;60101&gt;|publisher=[[Statistik Austria]]|language=Austrian|accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate ==
[[Oceanic climate]] is the type found in the city&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=4211&amp;cityname=Graz,+Styria,+Austria&amp;units=|title=Graz, Austria Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but due to the 0 ° C isotherm, the same occurs in a [[humid continental climate]] with based in [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]] (Cfb/Dfb borderline). [[Wladimir Köppen]] himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the [[Continental drift|Continental Drift theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=X4ymCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293&amp;lpg=PA293&amp;dq=Graz+koppen+climate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qYzy8clfiQ&amp;sig=f19Mzw_ibf9D_mqd2dwo_SNk9QE&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwirk46vpNLeAhUMkJAKHTdzA1wQ6AEwBHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Graz%20koppen%20climate&amp;f=false|title=Modern Climatology|last=Saha|first=Pijushkanti|date=2012-06-05|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=9788184247565|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its position southeast of the [[Alps]], Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the [[North Atlantic]] to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude.&lt;ref&gt;Graz-Universität Klimadaten&lt;/ref&gt; Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.

Politically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all [[Slovenes]], especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of [[University of Ljubljana]] in 1919. In 1574, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Compendium Catechismi in Slauonica lingua{{!}}first Slovene Catholic book|sl|3=Compendium Catechismi Catholici in Slavonica lingua per Questiones in gratiam Catholicae iuventutis propositum}} was published in Graz, and in 1592, [[Hieronymus Megiser]] published in Graz the book ''[[Dictionarium quatuor linguarum]]'', the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-H9LFKLTH/? |title=Primeri nekaj sklanjatev in spregatev v Megiserjevem Dictionarium quatuor linguarum 1592 |trans-title=The Concise Grammar of Four Languages in Megiser's 1592 Dictionary |language=sl |journal=Jezikoslovni zapiski |volume=13 |issue=1/2 |year=2007 |publisher=Inštitut za slovenski jezik Frana Ramovša, ZRC SAZU |id={{COBISS|ID=26967085}} |pages=23–32 |issn=0354-0448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styrian]] Slovenes did not consider Graz a German city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.&lt;ref name="Granda"/&gt;

Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the [[Institute for Jazz, Graz|Institute for Jazz]] in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia.&lt;ref name="Granda"/&gt; For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the [[Universalmuseum Joanneum]] archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.&lt;ref name="Granda"/&gt;

A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the [[Graz Lyzeum|Lyzeum of Graz]] in July 1811 on the initiative of {{Interlanguage link multi|Janez Nepomuk Primic|sl}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.srl.si/arhiv/2002-01/pdf/sumrada.pdf |title=Janez Nepomuk Primic in ustanovitev stolice za slovenski jezik na liceju v Gradcu 1811 |language=sl |trans-title=Janez Nepomuk Primic and the Establishment of the Chair of Slovene at the ''Lyzeum'' in Graz in 1811 |journal=Slavistična revija [Journal of Slavic Linguistics] |volume=50 |date=January–March 2002 |issue=1 |issn=1855-7570}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The [[Pošta Slovenije|Slovenian Post]] commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.posta.si/downloadfile.aspx?fileid=18801 |journal=Razgledi: glasilo Pošte Slovenije [Views: The Bulletin of the Post of Slovenia] |title=Predstavitev znamke v baročni dvorani graškega semenišča |publisher=Pošta Slovenije [Post of Slovenia] |first=Bojan |last=Bračič |date=November–December 2011 |editor=Korber, Mateja |issn= 1318-5705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
{{wide image|Graz Austria pano from Schlossberg.jpg|700px|A panoramic view of the old town from the Grazer Schlossberg}}
For Graz's stint as [[Cultural Capital of Europe]] a few new public buildings were erected in the city. The most famous is the [[Kunsthaus Graz|Kunsthaus]] (house of modern art) designed by [[Peter Cook (architect)|Peter Cook]] and [[Colin Fournier]], a museum constructed next to the river Mur, and the [[Murinsel]] (island in the Mur), an island made of steel, situated in the river. It was designed by the American architect [[Vito Acconci]] and contains a café, an open-air theatre and a playground.

=== Old Town ===
{{main|Innere Stadt (Graz)}}
[[File:Grazer Schlossberg Kriegssteig.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schlossberg (Graz)|Schlossberg]] (Castle mountain) with clock tower]]
The historic centre was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] in 1999&lt;ref name="graz-sh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graz.at/cms/ziel/4519230/EN/|title=A Short History of the City|website=www.graz.at|publisher=Stadt Graz – Magistratsdirektion, Abteilung für Öffentlichkeitsarbeit.|location=Graz|accessdate=25 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209042512/http://www.graz.at/cms/ziel/4519230/EN/|archive-date=9 December 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the old town consists of over 1000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.

The most important sights in the historic centre are:
* '''Rathaus''' (Town Hall).
* '''[[Schlossberg (Graz)|Schlossberg]]''', hill dominating the old town ({{convert|475|m|2|abbr=on}} high), site of demolished fortress, with views over Graz.
* '''Uhrturm''' clocktower, symbol of Graz, on the top of Schlossberg.
* '''Neue Galerie'''. Museum of art.
* '''[[Schloßbergbahn (Graz)|Schlossbergbahn]]''', a funicular railway up the Schlossberg.
* The '''Landhaus''', the building where the federal state parliament of Styria resides, a palace in Lombardic style. It is one of the most important examples of Renaissance architecture in Austria and was built by the Italian architect [[Domenico dell'Allio]] between 1557 and 1565.
* The '''[[Landeszeughaus]]''', armoury, the largest of its kind in the world.
* The '''[[Graz Opera|Opernhaus]]''', the principal venue for opera, ballet, and operetta performances. It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.
* The '''Schauspielhaus''', the principal theatre for productions of plays.
* '''[[Graz Cathedral|Dom]] '''(cathedral), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the ''Landplagenbild'' ("picture of plagues") painted in 1485, presumably by [[Thomas von Villach]]. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.
* '''Mausoleum''' of Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] next to the cathedral, the most important building of [[Mannerism]] in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.
* '''Burg''' (castle complex), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] because the old castle on the Schlossberg was too small and uncomfortable. The ''Burg'' remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence of the government of Styria.
* '''Gemaltes Haus''' ("painted house"), in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).
* '''[[Kunsthaus Graz|Kunsthaus]]''' (museum of modern art).
* '''[[Murinsel]]''', an artificial island in the Mur.
* '''Buildings''', '''courtyards''' (e. g. Early Renaissance courtyard of the ''Former House of Teutonic Knights'' in Sporgasse 22) and '''roofscape''' of the old town.

=== Outside the Old Town ===
[[File:Graz Schloss Eggenberg front facade.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schloss Eggenberg (Graz)|Schloss Eggenberg]]]]
* '''[[Schloss Eggenberg (Graz)|Schloss Eggenberg]]''' a Baroque palace on the western edge of Graz with State rooms and museum. In 2010 it was added to the existing World Heritage site of the historic centre of Graz.
* '''[[Mariatrost Basilica|Basilika Mariatrost]]''' a late Baroque church, on the eastern edge of Graz.
* The '''[[Herz-Jesu-Kirche (Graz)|Herz Jesu Kirche]]''' is the largest church in Graz with the third highest spire in Austria, built in Gothic Revival style.
* '''Calvary Hill''' in the Gösting area of Graz with a 17th-century cavalry and church.
* The '''LKH-Universitätsklinikum''', is the largest hospital in Graz and one of the largest hospitals in [[Austria]]. It is the largest Jugendstil building complex in Austria and was built between 1904 and 1912. It is run by the state and one of the most renowned hospitals in Austria and Central Europe.
* Best viewpoints for vistas of the city are '''[[Gösting Castle|Ruine Gösting]]''', hilltop castle ruins on northwestern edge of city, and '''Plabutsch/Fürstenstand''', behind Schloss Eggenberg with a hilltop restaurant and viewing tower.

The Old Town and the adjacent districts are characterized by the historic residential buildings and churches found there. In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.

In 1965 the ''Grazer Schule'' (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the ''RESOWI'' center by Günther Domenig.

Before Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the ''Stadthalle'', the ''Kindermuseum'' (museum for children), the ''Helmut-List-Halle'', the ''Kunsthaus'' and the ''Murinsel''.

It's still facing referendum, meaning usually the end for many former olympic bids in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] since 1970 -century.

=== Styriarte ===
Graz hosts the annual festival of classical music [[Styriarte]], founded in 1985 to tie conductor [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]] closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.

== Transport ==
[[File:Tramway graz23.jpg|thumb|right|Tram at [[Jakominiplatz]]]]
An extensive [[public transport]] network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the [[Trams in Graz|Graz tram network]] consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.

The [[Schlossbergbahn (Graz)|Schlossbergbahn]], a [[funicular railway]], and the [[Schlossberg lift]], a vertical lift, link the city centre to the [[Schlossberg (Graz)|Schlossberg]].

Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including [[Vienna]], [[Salzburg]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Maribor]] and [[Ljubljana]] in [[Slovenia]], [[Zagreb]] in [[Croatia]], [[Budapest]] in [[Hungary]], [[Prague]] and [[Brno]] in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Zürich]] in [[Switzerland]], as well as [[Munich]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Heidelberg]], and [[Frankfurt]] in [[Germany]]. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the "S-Bahn Graz", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.

'''Ixcateopan''' is an archaeological site located in the town and municipality of [[Ixcateopan de Cuauhtémoc]], 36 kilometers from Taxco, in the isolated and rugged mountains of the northern part of [[Guerrero]] state, [[Mexico]].

The explored archeological remains are part of a city which functioned as an important regional ceremonial center. Ixcateopan was a place of cult and army garrisons inhabited by various native groups, such as the Cohuixcas (people of the place where there are lizards), The Chontales (foreigners)&lt;ref&gt;Chontal, from the Nahuatl word chontalli, means "foreigner", has been applied to various different ethnic groups in the Mesoamerican world&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Aztecs, at the time when the latter were at war with the Purépecha.&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |last= Jiménez García |first=   Elizabeth |date=  |title= |trans-title=|journal= INAH, Based on the work of Robert Lister, Robert Barlow, Juan Yadeun, Eduardo Matos, Alejandro Pastrana, José Hernández, Mario Arturo Morales, Edgar Pavía y Raúl Vélez.|location= Mexico |url=http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za01002.html# |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is known as the final resting place of [[Cuauhtémoc]], the last [[Aztec]] [[Tlatoani]], whose remains were found under the parish church here in the mid-20th century. This church has been converted into a museum with displays a number of pre-Hispanic artifacts, offerings left in honor of the emperor and the remains of Cuauhtémoc himself.&lt;ref name="heroe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Quiroz Cuarón |first=Alfonso |title= Ichcateopan: La tumba de Cuauhtémoc – Héroe Supremo de la Historia de México|trans-title=Ixcateopan: The tomb of Cuahtemoc – Supreme Hero of the History of Mexico |year=2002 |publisher=Aconcagua Ediciones y Publicaciones, S. A. |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |pages=2–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a portion of the "original" structures remain, as a result of a street construction and multiple sackings that have occurred by people seeking “carved” stones.&lt;ref name=Guerrero &gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |title=Zonas Arqueológicas Guerrero|url=  http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&amp;ArtOrder=ReadArt&amp;Article=66 |publisher=Government of Guerrero |location=  |language= Spanish |trans-title=Guerrero Archaeological Sites  |year= |accessdate= Sep 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Only the civic-religious section can be seen, constituted by several rooms and open spaces, where remains of red stucco in the floors can be observed, the main structure is of circular shape and might have been dedicated to Quetzalcoatl. The chronological placing of the site is from 1350 to 1521 CE.&lt;ref name= Guerrero    /&gt;

==Background==
The first humans in the state’s territory were nomadic hunter-gatherers who left evidence of their existence in various caves starting about 22,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="enchistoria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |title=Estado de Guerrero Historia |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=State of Guerrero History |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003153/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="riquezahis"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&amp;ArtOrder=ReadArt&amp;Article=71 |title= La Riqueza Histórica de Guerrero |publisher= Government of Guerrero |location=Guerrero, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Historical Richness of Guerrero |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until about 8,000 years ago, climatic conditions better favored human habitation than those today;&lt;ref name="enchistoria"/&gt; however, sedimentary human habitation happened around this time in the mountainous areas with more moisture, and better soil for agriculture. After that, settlements appeared near the coast because of fishing.&lt;ref name="mediofisico"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/medi.htm |title=Estado de Guerrero Medio Fisico |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=State of Guerrero Environment |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616191605/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/medi.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At these sites, evidence of weaving, ceramics, basketry and other crafts have been found. Around this time, a grain called teocintle, or the forerunner to corn, became the staple of the diet.&lt;ref name="enchistoria"/&gt;

The first settlers of the state were the Olmecs during the Mesoamerican Preclassical period, establishing themselves in the vicinity of the Balsas River, living in caves. The chichimecas inhabited the Tierra Caliente region.&lt;ref name=Members   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= Antecedentes históricos del Estado de Guerrero.|trans-title=Historical background of the State of Guerrero |journal=  |location=  |url= http://members.tripod.com/chilapa_gro.mx/ante_edogro.html|language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to whether the earliest civilizations here were [[Olmec]]s who migrated to this region or native peoples who were heavily influenced by the Olmecs, especially in the [[Balsas River|Mexcala River]] area. Olmec influences can be seen in cave paintings such as those found in [[Juxtlahuaca]] and well as stone tools and jade jewelry from the time period.&lt;ref name="enchistoria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riquezahis"/&gt;

Eventually, the peoples of the Mexcala River area developed their own [[Mezcala culture|distinctive culture]], called Mezcala or Mexcala. It is characterized by its own sculpture and ceramics, distinguished by its simplicity. Olmec influence remained with this culture, especially evident in the grouping of villages, construction of ceremonial centers and a government dominated by priests. Later, the culture assimilated aspects of the [[Teotihuacan]] model, which included the [[Mesoamerican ball game]] .&lt;ref name="enchistoria"/&gt;

Later migrations to the area brought ethnicities such as the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]], the [[Mixtec]]s, the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] and the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]s who left traces on the local cultures as they established commercial centers around the 7th century. In the 8th century, [[Toltec]] influence was felt as they traveled the many trade routes through here in search of tropical bird plumage and [[amatl|amate paper]]. From the 12th century to the 15th, the various peoples of the state were influenced by the [[Chichimeca]]s, culminating in [[Aztec empire|Aztec domination]] by the 15th century.&lt;ref name="enchistoria"/&gt;

In the 11th century, new migrations entered the area from the north, which included the Nahuas, who occupied what is now the center of the state and the Purépecha who took over the west. The Nahuas established themselves in [[La Unión de Isidoro Montes de Oca|Zacatula]], [[Atoyac de Álvarez|Atoyac]] and [[Tlacotepec]], later conquering the areas occupied by the [[Putún Maya|Chontals]] and [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzincas]].&lt;ref name="riquezahis"/&gt;

By the 15th century, the territory of modern Guerrero state was inhabited by a number of peoples, none of whom had major cities or population centers. The most important of these peoples where the Purépecha, [[Cuitlatec people|Cuitlatec]]s, [[Ocuiteca]]s and Matlatzincas in the [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]], the Chontales, [[Mazatleco]]s and [[Tlahuica]]s in the Sierra del Norte, the [[Coixca]]s and [[Tepozteco]]s in the Central Valleys, the Tlapanecos and Mixtecs in the La Montaña, the [[Jopi]]s, Mixtecos and [[Amuzgo people|Amuzgos]] in [[Costa Chica of Guerrero|Costa Chica]] and [[Tolimeca]]s, [[Chubia]]s, [[Panteca]]s and Cuitlecas in [[Costa Grande of Guerrero|Costa Grande]]. Most of these lived in smaller dominions with moderate social stratification. One distinctive feature of the peoples of this was the use of cotton garments.&lt;ref name="enchistoria"/&gt;

The Aztecs began making incursions in the Guerrero area as early as 1414 under [[Chimalpopoca]] as part of the conquest of the [[Toluca Valley]]. Incursions into the Tierra Caliente came around 1433 under [[Itzcoatl]] who attacked the Cuitlatecos settled between the [[Teloloapan River|Teloloapan]] and [[Cocula River]]s. By 1440, the Aztec Empire controlled the north of the state, or the mountainous areas. Attempts to take the Costa Chica area began in 1452 against the Yopis, which failed. Various battles would be fought between 1452 and 1511 before most of the rest of the state became Aztec tributary provinces. The modern state of Guerrero the comprised seven Aztec provinces.&lt;ref name="enchistoria"/&gt;

Some of the inhabitants of this area before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]] were the Cohuixas and the [[Putún Maya|Chontals]]. The native community located at what is now the southern edge of the town dates back to at least 350 CE. This community was an important regional ceremonial center as well as the headquarters for the guardian soldiers. It was also closely associated with the production of cotton and cotton products, a valuable commodity at the time. Ixcateopan was one of the last cities to be subjugated by the [[Aztec Empire]]. The location served as a point to gather and then distribute tribute from surrounding areas. [[Mexica]] from other parts of the Aztec Empire, including soldiers, came here due to the wars between them and the [[Purépecha Empire]]. Because of this, Ixcateopan, originally a purely Chontal city, became multicultural.&lt;ref name="visiting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="declared"&gt;{{cite web |title= Ixcateopan may be Declared Archaeological Monuments Zone |url=http://dti.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1668&amp;Itemid=150 1 |publisher=INAH|date=September 2008 |accessdate=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tlatoani Cuauhtémoc===
Cuauhtémoc, the last Aztec [[Tlatoani]] (emperor), was born here in 1501. His mother, Cuayauhtitali, was the daughter of the Ixcateopan lord.  Shortly before Cuauhtémoc was born, Ixcateopan was subjugated by the Aztecs and Cuayauhtitli was captured and brought to Tenochtitlan. There she met prince Ahuizotl, who married her. Cuauhtémoc was born of this union. Cuauhtémoc was educated in [[Tenochtitlan]] and then sent back to Ixcateopan. In 1519, he was ordered back to the Aztec capital to help defend it against the Spanish. After the deaths of Emperors [[Moctezuma II]] and, a short time later, [[Cuitláhuac]], Cuauhtémoc became emperor, but was a captive of [[Hernán Cortés]] when Tenochtitlan fell in 1521. After enduring much torture, he and nine other Aztec lords were hung near a place called Izancánac in what is now [[Chiapas]] state.&lt;ref name="heroe"/&gt; The remains of Cuauhtémoc, the other Aztec lords and a priest who opposed their execution were brought to Ixcateopan and buried here.&lt;ref name="turista"&gt;{{cite news  |title= Sigue viva la memoria de Cuauhtémoc en Museo de Ixcateopan, Guerrero |trans-title=Cuahtémoc’s memory lives on at the Museum of Ixcateopan, Guerrero |url= http://www.turista.com.mx/article674.html  |agency= Notimex |date=2009-08-25 |accessdate=29 August 2009 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From that time to the mid-20th century, the whereabouts of his tomb remained unknown.&lt;ref name="heroe"/&gt;

Fray Torbio de Benavente, the local evangelist, and Fray [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] wrote texts about the death and burial of Cuauhtémoc which were initially kept at the Church of San Hipólito in [[Mexico City]] but somehow wound up in the hands of the family of Salvador Rodriguez Juárez, who was the doctor of Ixcateopan in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="turista"/&gt;  The documents had been passed down in his family for generations. They told of how Cuauhtémoc’s body had been recovered and brought to Ixcateopan and initially buried at the palace of his maternal grandparents in 1525. In 1529, Fray Toribio de Benavente had the body moved to a spot in front of the destroyed pagan temple, where the Church of Santa Maria de la Asunción would be built over it. The documents indicated that this tomb was nearly directly under the main altar of the church. After Rodríguez Juárez showed the documents to elders at the parish church, the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) was contacted, which sent archeologist [[Eulalia Guzmán]] to investigate the authenticity of the documents. After examining the documents, investigating the oral traditions of the area and other archeological and historical evidence, it was decided to excavate in the place where the documents indicated.&lt;ref name="heroe"/&gt;

===Toponymy===
The word Ixcateopan is of Nahuatl origin, from íxcatl or íchcatl, "Cotton", and teopan, teopancalli or teopantli, "temple", hence "cotton temple".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Ixcateopan (sometimes spelled Ichcateopan) from the [[Nahuatl]] words “ichcacates” (or “ixcatle”) and “moteopan,” “teopan,” or  “teopancalli.” Most interpret the first word as meaning cotton and the second temple, leading to a translation of temple of cotton. However, some sources claim the real name of the area is Zompancuahuithli, and the name was changed to Ixcateopan after the arrival of Cuauhtemoc's body and means (here is the temple/church). The glyph in the Mendoncino Codex for Ixcateopan reflects both interpretations, a cotton flower, a depiction of Cuauhtémoc and a pyramid.&lt;ref name="visiting"&gt;{{cite web |title= Ixcateopan |url= http://www.visitingmexico.com.mx/turismo-en-mexico/arqueologico/tur-arqueologico-guerrero-ixcateopan.php |language= Spanish |accessdate= 29 August 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100201211436/http://www.visitingmexico.com.mx/turismo-en-mexico/arqueologico/tur-arqueologico-guerrero-ixcateopan.php |archivedate= 1 February 2010 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gobmx"&gt;{{cite web |title= Ixcateopan de Cuauhtémoc  |url=http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=ixcateopan_de_cuauhtemoc |publisher=State of Guerrero |language=Spanish |accessdate=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; “De Cuauhtémoc” was added to Ixcateopan’s name by the Congress of the State of Guerrero in 1950.&lt;ref name="gobmx"/&gt;

However, according to the Mexico Municipalities Encyclopedia,  Ixcateopan is a Nahuatl derived word, from the words Ichacates and Moteopan, which mean: "here is your Lord of great respect" according to this version, the ancient name of the municipality was Zompancuahuithli, other authors attribute the meaning to "here is the Church" and others "Temple of cotton".&lt;ref name=Emm&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |date= |title=Ixcateopan de Cuauhtémoc |trans-title=|journal=Enciclopedia de los Municipios y Delegaciones de México |location=Mexico |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=Sep 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003153/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hieroglyphs in the [[Codex Mendoza]] represents two elements; a cotton flower called Ixcatl in Nahuatl placed on the steps of a pyramid representing a temple (in Nahuatl teopantli), the translated symbols of means: "in the Temple of cotton".&lt;ref name=Emm   /&gt;

As noted above, there were three main groups occupying the area, at one time or another, these were the Cohuixcas, Chontales and Aztecs.

===Cohuixcas===
Towards 1100 CE, the Nahua-Cohuixcas and [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] arrived in the area; the Cohuixcas settled the central region of the State of Guerrero, founding the towns of: Taxco, Iguala, Tepecoacuilco, Huitzuco, Tlaxmalac, Cocula, Teloloapan, Atenango, Tlamacazapa, Ixcateopan, Acapetlahuaya, Zumpango del Rio, Tlapa, Tixtla, Acapulco and Chilapa. The Purépecha groups founded Pungarabato, Coyuca Zirándaro and took over throughout the Tierra Caliente region.&lt;ref name= Members   /&gt;

They are referred to as Nahua-Cohuixcas, possibly because they spoke Nahuatl.&lt;ref&gt;The Nahuatl (derives from the words nāhua-tl, "clear or pleasant sound" and tlahtōl-li, "tongue or language) or Mexican is a Uto-Aztecan language spoken mainly by Mexico and Central America Nahuas. Emerged since at least the 7th century. Since the expansion of the Toltec at the end of 10th century Mesoamerican culture, Nahuatl began its diffusion over other mesoamerican languages to become the lingua franca in most of Mesoamerica, especially under territories conquered by the Mexicas, also called Aztecs, since the 13th century until their fall (August 13, 1521), this is the reason why the Nahuatl language is also known as the Mexican language.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nahua name is given to different ethnic groups who have Nahuatl or Mexican as a common language. Nahuatl means "something that sounds good, such as bell" and also "cunning or crafty man" (Ladino).&lt;ref name=NahuaCohuix   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= Los Nahuas del Estado de Guerrero |trans-title=The Nahua of the Guerrero State |journal=Buenas tareas  |location=  |url= http://www.buenastareas.com/ensayos/Los-Nahuas-Del-Estado-De-Guerrero/410259.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most important ethnic group in the Guerrero state was the Cohuixcas, who settled the central and northern regions. They came from northern territories. Coahuixca means "plain of snakes".&lt;ref name= NahuaCohuix   /&gt;

The Cohuixcas were the oldest inhabitants of this region, within the Atenango del Rio municipality, upon the Spaniards arrival, they were tributaries of the Aztecs, who through their expeditions had come to dominate this region.&lt;ref name=Sages   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= La importancia de los sabios Cohuixcas |trans-title=The importance of the Cohuixca sages |journal=Buenas tareas |location=  |url= http://www.buenastareas.com/ensayos/Grupos-En-La-Escuela/914221.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Chontales, Cohuixcas and other small fractions of peoples who spoke various languages, scattered from Guerrero to Oaxaca, nothing is known; modern people judges them from remains of tribes that preceded the Nations that left history traces.&lt;ref name=Sages   /&gt;

This opinion is not so risky; Humboldt in the past, had tried the same judgment, while incurring certain errors. «The Nations that successively invaded Mexico, he noted, the Toltec, the chichimecas, the nahuatlaques, the Acolhuas, the Tlaxcaltecas and the Aztecs, formed a single group, almost like the Germans, the Norwegians, Goths and Danes, mixed into a single race; the Germanic peoples.» It is likely, that other Nations such as the Otomi, Olmecs, Cuitlateques, Zacatecos and Purépecha, have appeared in the region before the Toltec. Wherever people have progressed in the same direction, the place they geographically occupy somehow designates the chronological order of their migrations. By the same rule can place the Nations who spoke lost languages.&lt;ref name=Sages   /&gt;

The last external offensive from forces loyal to the Aztecs came from the Malinalcas, Matlatzincas and Cohuixcas. Spaniards Andrés de Tapia and Gonzalo de Sandoval stop their advance.&lt;ref name=Norma   &gt;{{cite journal |last=Lopez Simon |first=Norma B. |date=  |title= La conquista de Mexico|trans-title=The conquest of Mexico |journal=Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de estudios superiores, Aragón|location= Mexico|url=http://www.buenastareas.com/ensayos/La-Conquista-De-Mexico/230898.html|language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chontales===
There are two ethnic groups called Chontales, which do not have any cultural or linguistic relationship to each other:&lt;ref name=Chonoax   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= Chontales Oaxaca: Principales Grupos Indígenas |trans-title=Chontales Oaxaca: Major indigenous groups  |journal=  |location=  |url= http://www.buenastareas.com/ensayos/Oaxaca/127703.html
|language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chontales of Tabasco====
'''Chontales de Tabasco''', as they are commonly known, another designation is mayas-chontales or Maya putunes in the academic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Roys (1996); Thompson (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the own struggles for social, political, economic demands, basic services, cultural rights and defense of their identity, the native groups call themselves, yoko-winik "the real man". The Chontal Supreme Council call themselves Yokokiniko ethnia: “real man and natives of these lands”.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atlas   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Martínez Ruiz |first=   José Luis |date=  |title= Atlas de las Culturas del agua en América Latina y el caribe |trans-title=Atlas of wáter cultures in Latin America and the Caribbean  |journal=  Pueblos indígenas de Mexico y Agua: Yokotames de Tabasco |location=  Instituto Mexicano de Tecnología del Agua |url= http://www.buenastareas.com/ensayos/04-Chontales-De-Tabasco/437315.html
|language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Chontal group is a descendant of the Mayans, the so-called Acalan-Tixchel chontales, and today are seated in the municipalities of Nacajuca, Centla, Jonuta, Macuspana and Center, in prehispanic times their presence extended to other municipalities such as Tenosique, Emiliano Zapata, Jalapa, Cardenas and Cunduacán.&lt;ref name=Atlas   /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roys: 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yoko ochoco''', also known as '''Chontal Maya''', and '''Acalan''', is a [[Maya people|Maya]] [[Mayan languages|language]] of the [[Chol language|Cholan]] family spoken by the [[Chontal Maya people]] of the [[Mexican state]] of [[Tabasco]]. There are at least three [[dialects]], identified as Tamulté de las Sábanas Chontal, Buena Vista Chontal, and Miramar Chontal.

====Chontales of Oaxaca====
'''Chontales de Oaxaca''' or Tequistlatecos, the term comes from Tequisistlán, one of its main towns in the past. Their language, tequistlateco Joca-Meridional group and trunk Yumapacua, seems to be related with some languages of Baja California Norte, in the southeast of Mexico, Honduras and/or Nicaragua; however, to date their linguistic origin is still uncertain. There are dialect differences between speakers of the mountains and the coast, which hinders their mutual understanding.&lt;ref name= Chonoax   /&gt;

The '''Tequistlatecan languages''', also called '''Chontal of Oaxaca''', consists of three distinct languages.  One called '''Huamelultec''' or '''Lowland Oaxaca Chontal''', '''Tequistlatec''' (which is probably extinct), and '''Highland Oaxaca Chontal'''. The ''Chontal'' languages are spoken by the Chontal people of the [[Mexican state]] of [[Oaxaca]]. Highland Chontal and Lowland Chontal (Huamelultec)  are mutually unintelligible languages.

The Tequistlatecan languages are part of some versions of the controversial [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] Macro-family proposal, but generally considered to be [[language isolate|isolates]]. Campbell and Oltrogge (1980) believe that the Tequistlatecan languages may be related to [[Jicaque people|Jicaquean]] but this hypothesis remains to be explored further.

==The Site==
The archaeological site remains so far explored comprise a section that possibly functioned as an important ceremonial center at regional level. Ixcateopan was placed of cult and war goods storage inhabited by various native populations, such as Cohuixcas “people from the place with small lizards”, the chontales “foreigners” and by mexicas, at the time when they were at war with the purépecha. The buildings correspond to at least five different constructive periods; the complex was dedicated to religious ceremonies, administrative activities and trade.&lt;ref name=Turismo&gt;{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Turismo Arqueológico en Guerrero|url=http://www.visitingmexico.com.mx/turismo-en-mexico/arqueologico/tur-arqueologico-guerrero.php|publisher=Visiting Mexico|location=|language=Spanish|trans-title=Archaeological tourism in Guerrero|year=|accessdate=Sep 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811111741/http://www.visitingmexico.com.mx/turismo-en-mexico/arqueologico/tur-arqueologico-guerrero.php|archivedate=2010-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some Mexica military raids to areas near the [[Balsas River]], under the command of [[Itzcóatl]] fourth Mexica [[Tlatoani]] (from [[náhuatl]] tlahtoāni “the speaker”), the military success over the northern part of the current Guerrero State was formalized during the ruling of Moctezuma Ilhuicamina, fifth [[Mexica]] “huey tlatoani” from 1440 to 1469, during which period the people of Oztuma, Ixcateopan, Taxco, Tlaxmalac and Cuetzala were conquered. Therefore, Ixcateopan became a tributary province of Tepecoacuilco.

The above was intimately associated with storage activities and clothing manufacturing from cotton, raw material that had to be the main source of supply and cult in the region. The archaeological zone is formed by a series of over laid structures built on the natural land elevation, it occupies approximately 5 thousand square meters. For construction they used local materials like: stone slabs, limestone and marble; for finishing, stucco and red paint was used.&lt;ref name= Turismo    /&gt;

Finding of ancient instruments in the Ixcateopan archeological site corroborates that this place was subjugated by the Mexica military power.&lt;ref name=Azteca   &gt;{{cite journal |last=Administrator |first=   |date=  May 3, 2010 |title= Hallazgo de antiguos instrumentos en la zona arqueológica de Ixcateopan corroboran que este lugar era sojuzgado por el poderío militar mexica |trans-title=Discovery of ancient instruments in the archaeological zone of Ixcateopan corroborate this place was dominated by Aztec military power  |journal=  Azteca |volume=21|location=  |url= |language=Spanish |format= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ixcateopan was one of the last places conquered and dominated by the Mexica military power, becoming towards the end of the 15th and early 16th century, a tributary of the Triple Alliance; tools found at this archaeological site corroborate that this prehispanic site spun cotton for Tenochtitlan, which was used to make soldiers suits.&lt;ref name=Perio   &gt;{{cite web |first=   |last=  |title=  Hallan en Ixcateopan un sitio que hilaba algodón a Tenochtitlán|url=http://www.periodicodigital.com.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=110183&amp;catid=37&amp;Itemid=76|publisher=Periódico Digital|location= |language=Spanish|trans-title=Found in Ixcateopan a site that spun cotton for Tenochtitlan |date= May 4, 2010 |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several site excavations ancient instruments were found, mainly spindle whorls apparatus (malacates&lt;ref&gt;[https://ucalgary.academia.edu/GeoffreyMcCafferty/Papers/137684/Textile_Production_in_Postclassic_Cholula_Mexico Mesoamerican Textile Production]&lt;/ref&gt;), in the remains of some rooms.&lt;ref name=Perio    /&gt;

[[File:Malacate3.jpg|thumb|right|Ceramic Malacate]]
[[File:Malacate.jpg|thumb|left|Ceramic Malacate]]

===Malacates===
The Malacates or disks with a central hole, sometimes referred to as “Rodelas” (washers), are complex to analyze. On the one hand, they have often been associated with spindle whorls, although there is little ethnographic documentation to support it was their main function.&lt;ref name="Moholy-Nagy: 2003"&gt;Moholy-Nagy: 2003&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, sometimes it is considered that these could have been beads or hanging decoration. It is difficult to consider other features for these curious samples.&lt;ref name=Malacate   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Reyes, Mara A.|first=   Laporte, Juan Pedro|date=  |title= Cronología, contexto y función de los artefactos cerámicos en el sureste del Peten|trans-title=Chronology, context and function of ceramic artifacts in the southeast of the Petén |journal=  |location=  |url= http://www.buenastareas.com/ensayos/Hilar-Tapar-Jugar-cronologia-Contexto-Y-Funcion/1203179.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other functional possibility, that considered them as beads or hanging decoration, is somewhat complex to analyze, considering these are disks with perforated center holes and not precisely on its edges, as they could easily hung as necklace beads and pendant disks.&lt;ref name="Moholy-Nagy: 2003"/&gt; In fact, the rodelas could have functioned as necklace beads, on a necklace that used on edge rather than front position. In other words, is a peculiar ornament, but not impossible to do.&lt;ref name=Malacate   /&gt;

The Malacates are all artifacts of primary class ceramic artifacts. Decoration on its upper side, many of them are flat on the bottom section, but the shape -all are circular- is variable in their section. In the past, (in Chiapas), it was mentioned that some Malacates were tapered, flat and mixed&lt;ref&gt;Navarrete: 1966&lt;/ref&gt; existed.&lt;ref name=Malacate   /&gt;
Its most definite function,  more than any of the remaining ceramic artifacts, always considered as spindle whorls. However, as a secondary or alternate function could also serve as necklace beads.&lt;ref name=Malacate   /&gt;

The finding of malacates, plus the Nahuatl site denomination, “Cotton Temple”, implies that Ixcateopan provided large amounts of this plant, already manufactured, to the towns of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan.&lt;ref name=Azteca   /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perio   /&gt;

It is considered that Ixcateopan spun cotton that was used to make suits of the mexicas soldiers. These data corroborate the narrow relation between Ixcateopan and the center of Mexico; local ceramics remains found here, are similar to those from the Valley of Mexico.&lt;ref name=Azteca  /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perio   /&gt;

These aspects seem to point out that, since Ixcateopan did not have the topographic and strategic characteristics of sites located in the war belt, very possibly it formed part of the Mexica rear and was a storage place, for foods and war equipment.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name=Azteca  /&gt;

Ixcateopan was a Chontal settlement, and even though neither their language nor physical features are known, archaeological y physical anthropologic studies shall determine the various aspects of this cultural group, unknown to date. However, this prehispanic site had a multi-cultural configuration.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perio  /&gt;

In the north of the Guerrero State, Ixcateopan represents the only late postclassical period (1200–1521 AD.) site that has been extensively explored.&lt;ref name=Azteca  /&gt;

Excavations from the first field season at this archaeological site, conducted in 2008, provided detection of at least three constructive stages, from 1450 to 1521 AD. This is known from ceramic remains of the denominated type Aztec III, other locally manufactured as an imitation of the previous, fragments of the type called “Rojo Texcoco”, from Cholula and, in addition, two local types colored dark red over beige and “Yestla”-Orange.&lt;ref name=Azteca  /&gt;

This unique village could well be named "the marble town", because its narrow streets are paved with this noble material, which magnificently beautifies the physiognomy of the town, due to the borrow sites surrounding the town.&lt;ref name=Marble   &gt;{{cite web |first=   Arturo|last=  Chairez |title= A este singular poblado bien podría agregársele el sobrenombre de "pueblo de mármol" |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/ixcateopan-de-cuauhtemoc-guerrero.html|publisher=   Guía México desconocido No. 66 Guerrero |location= |language= Spanish|trans-title=This unique village could well be named "marble town" |date=Jan 2001 |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structures===
Ixcateopan covers an extension of about one hectare and a half, and it is within the city of the same name, where circular altars are distributed and stairways, finished in a dice shape.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

East and west sections of the site have been explored, which was built on a natural slope. In the first area vestiges of a 56 meters long wall was found, part of a platform; and in the second area (west) a series of terraces were found.&lt;ref name=Perio    /&gt;

The top of this slope was arranged by means of artificial terraces, which facilitated the construction of a large platform on which the ceremonial center was built, as well as plazas, walkways, stairways, living quarters and storage.&lt;ref name=Perio    /&gt;

The constructions, from the postclassical period, were built between 1350 and 1450 CE.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The buildings are at least from five different constructive periods; the complex was dedicated to religious ceremonies, administrative and trade activities.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Esto a su vez, está íntimamente asociado an actividades de almacenamiento y elaboración de productos derivados del algodón, materia prima que debió ser la principal fuente de abasto y de culto en la región.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The archaeological zone consists of a series of overlays built on a natural elevation of the terrain, which occupies approximately 5 thousand square meters. Construction materials employed include: stone slabs, marble, limestone, boulders; and stucco and red paint used for finishing.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Ceramic===
Ceramic artifacts are a large and important group of samples found, generally mentioned in archaeological reports, serve to describe as well as chronological placement of sites, although seldom are investigation and study specific subjects&lt;ref name=Malacate   /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dixon: 1959; Sanders: 1961; Green &amp; Lowe: 1967; Nelson: 1973; Howell: 1989; Hermes: 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical ceramics used at that time was made of three legged hollow “Boxes” (cajetes), and with a streamlined serpent shape, or metlapilcoate. “Cajetes” were painted brown over beige, and there were other decoration painted color brown, black and polychrome beige.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Gods===
The 16th century geographic relations written by Lucas Pinto, state that in "Ichcateopan", people adored two main Gods, a man and a woman, called "Iztac Tlamacazqui" (white priest) and Acxoyatl Cihuatl (the fir tree woman). Two main priests were in charge of the cult and the sacrifice of virgin women. The population made penances and self-sacrifices; they stuck their tongue and ears with thorns, removed blood and ignited copal. The white priest seemed to represent cotton, part Ixcateopan glyph of the place name.

==Other Sites in the Guerrero State==
The zone has older Olmec settlements from the mid preclassical (1200 – 400 BC.) period such as [[Teopantecuanitlán]] and [[Oxtotitlán]], as well as from the classical and postclassical (200 BC. - 1521 AD.), during which period it had a cultural mosaic, and people talked in various languages; tlapanec, mixteco, Nahuatl, Matlatzinca, purépecha, etc.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Kristen R. Ghodsee''' (born April 26, 1970) is an American ethnographer and Professor of Russian and East European Studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref&gt;Faculty page: https://rees.sas.upenn.edu/people/kristen-r-ghodsee&lt;/ref&gt; known primarily for her ethnographic work on post-communist [[Bulgaria]] as well as being a contributor to the field of postsocialist [[gender studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/exploratory-seminars/gender-socialism-and-postsocialism|title=Gender, Socialism, and Postsocialism: Transatlantic Dialogues &amp;#124; Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University|publisher=Radcliffe.harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the prevailing opinion of most feminist scholars in the 1990s who believed that women would be disproportionately harmed by the collapse of [[communism]], Ghodsee argued that many East European women would actually fare better than men in newly competitive labor markets because of the [[cultural capital]] that they had acquired before 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wings.buffalo.edu/ARD/cgi/showme.cgi?keycode=2812|title=Anthropology Review Database|publisher=Wings.buffalo.edu|date=2008-02-25|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was critical of the role of Western feminist [[nongovernmental organizations]] doing work among East European women in the 1990s. She examined the shifting gender relations of Muslim minorities after communism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kristen Ghodsee|url=http://intl-eep.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/04/21/0888325410364254|title=Minarets after Marx: Islam, Communist Nostalgia, and the Common Good in Postsocialist Bulgaria|publisher=Intl-eep.sagepub.com|date=2010-04-21|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the intersections of Islamic beliefs and practices with the ideological remains of [[Marxism–Leninism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1556-3502.2009.50531_2.x/abstract|title=The Headscarf Debate in Bulgaria |date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2015-04-02|doi=10.1111/j.1556-3502.2009.50531_2.x|volume=50|issue=5|journal=Anthropology News|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ghodsee received her B.A. from the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]] and her Ph.D. from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  She has been awarded numerous research fellowships, including those from the [[National Science Foundation]], [[Fulbright]], the [[American Council of Learned Societies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acls.org/research/fellow.aspx?cid=8c706223-f8a4-db11-8d10-000c2903e717|title=Kristen R.

She was a resident fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.ias.edu/people/past-scholars|title=Past Scholars &amp;#124; School of Social Science|publisher=Sss.ias.edu|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/kghodsee|title=Ghodsee, Kristen Rogheh &amp;#124; Institute for Advanced Study|publisher=Ias.edu|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in Washington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/staff/kristen-r-ghodsee|title=Kristen R.

==Red Nostalgia and Neoliberalism==
In 2004, Ghodsee published one of the first articles considering the gendered aspects of the growing [[nostalgia]] for the communist era in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/Geschichte/LHOMME/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19%3A15-1-2004-postkommunismen&amp;catid=5%3Alhomme-zfg&amp;Itemid=6&amp;lang=en |title=15, 1 (2004), Post/Kommunismen |publisher=Univie.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Already beginning in the late 1990s, various scholars were examining the phenomenon of ''[[Ostalgie]]'' in former East Germany and what had been called “[[Yugo-nostalgia]]” in the successor states of the former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diasporiclivesofobjects2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/east-german-objects-nostaligia.pdf|format=PDF|title='(N)Ostalgie' for the present: Memory, longing, and East German things|author=Daphne Berdahla|publisher=Diasporiclivesofobjects2012.files.wordpress.com|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This earlier work on the emergence of communist nostalgia focused on its consumer aspects and considered the phenomenon a necessary phase that post-socialist populations needed to pass through in order to fully break with their communist pasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ahu.2000.25.2.131/abstract|title="Go, Trabi, Go!": Reflections on a Car and Its Symbolization over Time  |accessdate=2015-04-02 | doi=10.1525/ahu.2000.25.2.131|volume=25|issue=2|journal=Anthropology and Humanism|pages=131–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, her concept of "red nostalgia" considered how individual men and women experienced the loss of the real material benefits of the socialist past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wamc.org/post/dr-kristen-ghodsee-bowdoin-college-nostalgia-communism|title=Dr. Kristen Ghodsee, Bowdoin College - Nostalgia for Communism|publisher=Wamc.org|date=2011-11-01|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2004-11-09-lhommeabstr-en.html|title=Abstracts for L'Homme 1/2004|publisher=Eurozine.com|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than just a wistful glance back at a lost youth, red nostalgia formed the basis of an emerging critique of the political and economic upheavals that characterized the post-socialist era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-specter-still-haunts-revisiting-1989|title=The Specter Still Haunts: Revisiting 1989|publisher=Dissentmagazine.org|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/12/05/confidence-in-democracy-and-capitalism-wanes-in-former-soviet-union|title=Confidence in Democracy and Capitalism Wanes in Former Soviet Union - Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|publisher=Pewglobal.org|date=2011-12-05|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Ghodsee has explored the politics of [[public memory]] about communism, World War II, and the Bulgarian Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muftah.org/historical-amnesia-in-eastern-europe|title=Victims of Communism and Historical Amnesia in Eastern Europe|publisher=Muftah.org|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/historypresent.4.2.0115 Ghodsee profile], jstor.org; accessed April 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2017 book ''Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism'', Ghodsee posits that the triumphalist attitudes of Western powers at the end of the [[Cold War]], and the fixation with linking all leftist and [[socialist]] political ideals with the horrors of [[Stalinism]], allowed [[neoliberalism]] to fill the void, which undermined democratic institutions and reforms, leaving a trail of economic misery, unemployment, hopelessness and rising inequality throughout the former [[Eastern Bloc]] and much of the West in the following decades that has fueled the rise of extremist [[nationalism]] in both the former and the latter. She says that the time has come "to rethink the democratic project and finally do the work necessary to either rescue it from the death grip of neoliberalism, or replace it with a new political ideal that leads us forward to a new stage of human history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghodsee|first=Kristen|date=2017 |title=Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-hangover|location= |publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|pages=xix-xx, 134, 197–200 |isbn=978-0822369493|author-link=Kristen R. Ghodsee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary ethnography==
Ghodsee's later work combines traditional ethnography with a literary sensibility, employing the stylistic conventions of creative nonfiction to produce academic texts that are meant to be accessible to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;''From Notes to Narrative: Writing Ethnographies that Everyone Can Read''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the work of [[Clifford Geertz]] and the conventions of “[[thick description]]”, she is a proponent of “literary ethnography.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1409.2011.01091.x/abstract|title=Walking the Walk: On the Epistemological Merits of Literary Ethnography |date=2011-12-09|accessdate=2015-04-02|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1409.2011.01091.x|volume=36|issue=2|journal=Anthropology and Humanism|pages=178–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genre uses narrative tension, dialogue and lyrical prose in the presentation of ethnographic data.  Furthermore, Ghodsee argues that literary ethnographies are often “documentary ethnographies,” i.e. ethnographies whose primary purpose is to explore the inner working of a particular culture without necessarily subsuming these observations to a specific theoretical agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://literary-ethnography.tumblr.com/post/13995875783/syrian-episodes-fathers-sons-and-an|title=Literary Ethnography|publisher=Literary-ethnography.tumblr.com|accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Ghodsee's scholarly work on gender and everyday life during and after socialism has drawn criticism from both Western [[feminists]] and [[communists]].  In a 2014 essay in the ''European Journal of Women’s Studies'', philosopher Nanette Funk included Ghodsee among a handful of “Revisionist Feminist Scholars” who uncritically tout the achievements of communist era women's organizations, ignoring the oppressive nature of authoritarian regimes in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funk | first1 = Nanette | year = 2014 | title = A very tangled knot: Official state socialist women's organizations, women's agency and feminism in Eastern European state socialism | url = http://ejw.sagepub.com/content/21/4/344.abstract | journal = European Journal of Women’s Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 344–360 | doi=10.1177/1350506814539929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funk argued that the “Feminist Revisionists” are too eager in their “desire to find women’s agency in an anti-capitalist Marxist past,” and that this “leads to distortions” and “making overly bold claims” about the possibilities for feminist activism under communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funk | first1 = Nanette | year = 2015 | title = (K)not so: A response to Kristen Ghodsee | url = http://ejw.sagepub.com/content/22/3/350.refs | journal = European Journal of Women's Studies | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 350–355 | doi=10.1177/1350506815592759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Ghodsee asserts that her scholarship seeks to expand the idea of feminism beyond the attainment of "personal self-actualization", asserting that "if the goal of feminism is to improve women’s lives, along with eliminating discrimination and promoting equality with men, then there is ample room to reconsider what Krassimira Daskalova calls the ‘women-friendly’ policies of state socialist women's organizations." She notes that "the goal of much recent scholarship on state socialist women’s organizations is to show how the communist ideology could lead to real improvements in women’s literacy, education, professional training, as well as access to health care, the extension of paid maternity leave, and a reduction of their economic dependence on men (facts that even Funk does not deny)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ghodsee|first1=Kristen R.|year= 2015|title=Untangling the knot: A response to Nanette Funk|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kristenghodsee/files/ghodsee_response_to_funk_-_ejws.pdf|journal=European Journal of Women’s Studies|volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=248–252 |doi=10.1177/1350506815571264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19710">In [[information theory]], [[linguistics]] and [[computer science]], the '''Levenshtein distance''' is a [[string metric]] for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. It is named after the Soviet mathematician [[Vladimir Levenshtein]], who considered this distance in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Влади́мир И.

Levenshtein distance may also be referred to as '''edit distance''', although that term may also denote a larger [[Edit distance|family of distance metrics]].&lt;ref name="navarro"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Navarro |first1=Gonzalo |doi=10.1145/375360.375365 |title=A guided tour to approximate string matching |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=31–88 |year=2001 |url=http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/126168/Navarro_Gonzalo_Guided_tour.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.452.6317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}} It is closely related to [[Sequence alignment#Pairwise alignment|pairwise string alignments]].

== Definition ==
Mathematically, the Levenshtein distance between two strings &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; (of length &lt;math&gt;|a|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|b|&lt;/math&gt; respectively) is given by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lev}_{a,b}(|a|,|b|)&lt;/math&gt; where

:&lt;math&gt;\qquad\operatorname{lev}_{a,b}(i,j) = \begin{cases}
  \max(i,j) &amp; \text{ if } \min(i,j)=0, \\
  \min \begin{cases}
          \operatorname{lev}_{a,b}(i-1,j) + 1 \\
          \operatorname{lev}_{a,b}(i,j-1) + 1 \\
          \operatorname{lev}_{a,b}(i-1,j-1) + 1_{(a_i \neq b_j)}
       \end{cases} &amp; \text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;1_{(a_i \neq b_j)}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]] equal to 0 when  &lt;math&gt;a_i = b_j&lt;/math&gt; and equal to 1 otherwise, and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lev}_{a,b}(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the first &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; characters of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the first &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; characters of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the first element in the minimum corresponds to deletion (from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;), the second to insertion and the third to match or mismatch, depending on whether the respective symbols are the same.

=== Example ===
For example, the Levenshtein distance between "kitten" and "sitting" is 3, since the following three edits change one into the other, and there is no way to do it with fewer than three edits:

# '''k'''itten → '''s'''itten (substitution of "s" for "k")
# sitt'''e'''n → sitt'''i'''n (substitution of "i" for "e")
# sittin → sittin'''g''' (insertion of "g" at the end).

===Upper and lower bounds===
The Levenshtein distance has several simple upper and lower bounds. These include:
* It is at least the difference of the sizes of the two strings.
* It is at most the length of the longer string.
* It is zero if and only if the strings are equal.
* If the strings are the same size, the [[Hamming distance]] is an upper bound on the Levenshtein distance.
* The Levenshtein distance between two strings is no greater than the sum of their Levenshtein distances from a third string ([[triangle inequality]]).

An example where the Levenshtein distance between two strings of the same length is strictly less than the Hamming distance is given by the pair "flaw" and "lawn". Here the Levenshtein distance equals 2 (delete "f" from the front; insert "n" at the end). The [[Hamming distance]] is 4.

==Applications==
In [[approximate string matching]], the objective is to find matches for short strings in many longer texts, in situations where a small number of differences is to be expected. The short strings could come from a dictionary, for instance. Here, one of the strings is typically short, while the other is arbitrarily long. This has a wide range of applications, for instance, [[spell checker]]s, correction systems for [[optical character recognition]], and software to assist natural language translation based on [[translation memory]].

The Levenshtein distance can also be computed between two longer strings, but the cost to compute it, which is roughly proportional to the product of the two string lengths, makes this impractical.  Thus, when used to aid in [[fuzzy string searching]] in applications such as [[record linkage]], the compared strings are usually short to help improve speed of comparisons.

In linguistics, the Levenshtein distance is used as a metric to quantify the [[linguistic distance]], or how different two languages are from one another. It is related to [[mutual intelligibility]], the higher the linguistic distance, the lower the mutual intelligibility, and the lower the linguistic distance, the higher the mutual intelligibility.

==Relationship with other edit distance metrics==
{{main|Edit distance}}
There are other popular measures of [[edit distance]], which are calculated using a different set of allowable edit operations. For instance,
* the [[Damerau–Levenshtein distance]] allows insertion, deletion, substitution, and the [[Transposition (mathematics)|transposition]] of two adjacent characters;
* the [[longest common subsequence problem|longest common subsequence]] (LCS) distance allows only insertion and deletion, not substitution;
* the [[Hamming distance]] allows only substitution, hence, it only applies to strings of the same length.
* the [[Jaro distance]] allows only [[Transposition (mathematics)|transposition]].

[[Edit distance]] is usually defined as a parameterizable metric calculated with a specific set of allowed edit operations, and each operation is assigned a cost (possibly infinite). This is further generalized by DNA [[sequence alignment]] algorithms such as the [[Smith–Waterman algorithm]], which make an operation's cost depend on where it is applied.

==Computing Levenshtein distance==
===Recursive===
This is a straightforward, but inefficient, recursive [[C (programming language)|C]] implementation of a &lt;code&gt;LevenshteinDistance&lt;/code&gt; function that takes two strings, ''s'' and ''t'', together with their lengths, and returns the Levenshtein distance between them:

&lt;!--
  Please do not add an additional implementation in your language of choice.
  Many of those have been added to and deleted from this article in the past.
  See the talk page archive for relevant discussion
--&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C"&gt;
// len_s and len_t are the number of characters in string s and t respectively
int LevenshteinDistance(const char *s, int len_s, const char *t, int len_t)
{ 
  int cost;

  /* base case: empty strings */
  if (len_s == 0) return len_t;
  if (len_t == 0) return len_s;

  /* test if last characters of the strings match */
  if (s[len_s-1] == t[len_t-1])
      cost = 0;
  else
      cost = 1;

  /* return minimum of delete char from s, delete char from t, and delete char from both */
  return minimum(LevenshteinDistance(s, len_s - 1, t, len_t    ) + 1,
                 LevenshteinDistance(s, len_s    , t, len_t - 1) + 1,
                 LevenshteinDistance(s, len_s - 1, t, len_t - 1) + cost);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This implementation is very inefficient because it recomputes the Levenshtein distance of the same substrings many times.

A more efficient method would never repeat the same distance calculation. For example, the Levenshtein distance of all possible prefixes might be stored in an array {{code|lang=C|code=d[][]}} where {{code|lang=C|code=d[i][j]}} is the distance between the first &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; characters of string &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; and the first &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; characters of string &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;. The table is easy to construct one row at a time starting with row 0. When the entire table has been built, the desired distance is {{code|lang=C|code=d[len_s][len_t]}}.

===Iterative with full matrix===
{{main|Wagner–Fischer algorithm}}
::{{small|Note: This section uses 1-based strings instead of 0-based strings}}
Computing the Levenshtein distance is based on the observation that if we reserve a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to hold the Levenshtein distances between all [[prefix (computer science)|prefix]]es of the first string and all prefixes of the second, then we can compute the values in the matrix in a [[dynamic programming]] fashion, and thus find the distance between the two full strings as the last value computed.

This algorithm, an example of bottom-up [[dynamic programming]], is discussed, with variants, in the 1974 article ''The [[String-to-string correction problem]]'' by Robert A. Wagner and Michael J. Fischer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Robert A. |last=Wagner |first2=Michael J. |last2=Fischer |author2-link=Michael J. Fischer |title=The String-to-String Correction Problem |journal=Journal of the ACM |volume=21 |issue=1 |year=1974 |pages=168–173 |doi= 10.1145/321796.321811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a straightforward pseudocode implementation for a function &lt;code&gt;LevenshteinDistance&lt;/code&gt; that takes two strings, ''s'' of length ''m'', and ''t'' of length ''n'', and returns the Levenshtein distance between them:

The [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] maintained throughout the algorithm is that we can transform the initial segment {{code|lang=C|code=s[1..i]}} into {{code|lang=C|code=t[1..j]}} using a minimum of {{code|lang=C|code=d[i,j]}} operations. At the end, the bottom-right element of the array contains the answer.

===Iterative with two matrix rows===
It turns out that only two rows of the table are needed for the construction if one does not want to reconstruct the edited input strings (the previous row and the current row being calculated).

The Levenshtein distance may be calculated iteratively using the following algorithm:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Fast, memory efficient Levenshtein algorithm |first=Sten |last=Hjelmqvist |date=26 Mar 2012 |url=http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/13525/Fast-memory-efficient-Levenshtein-algorithm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C"&gt;
function LevenshteinDistance(char s[1..m], char t[1..n]):
    // create two work vectors of integer distances
    declare int v0[n + 1]
    declare int v1[n + 1]

    // initialize v0 (the previous row of distances)
    // this row is A[0][i]: edit distance for an empty s
    // the distance is just the number of characters to delete from t
    for i from 0 to n:
        v0[i] = i

    for i from 0 to m-1:
        // calculate v1 (current row distances) from the previous row v0

        // first element of v1 is A[i+1][0]
        //   edit distance is delete (i+1) chars from s to match empty t
        v1[0] = i + 1

        // use formula to fill in the rest of the row
        for j from 0 to n-1:
            // calculating costs for A[i+1][j+1]
            deletionCost := v0[j + 1] + 1
            insertionCost := v1[j] + 1
            if s[i] = t[j]:
                substitutionCost := v0[j]
            else:
                substitutionCost := v0[j] + 1

            v1[j + 1] := minimum(deletionCost, insertionCost, substitutionCost)

        // copy v1 (current row) to v0 (previous row) for next iteration
        swap v0 with v1
    // after the last swap, the results of v1 are now in v0
    return v0[n]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This two row variant is suboptimal—the amount of memory required may be reduced to one row and one word of overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://bitbucket.org/clearer/iosifovich/ | title=Clearer / Iosifovich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hirschberg's algorithm]] combines this method with [[Divide and conquer algorithms|divide and conquer]]. It can compute the optimal edit sequence, and not just the edit distance, in the same asymptotic time and space bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirschberg|first=D. S.|authorlink=Dan Hirschberg|title=A linear space algorithm for computing maximal common subsequences|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|volume=18|issue=6|year=1975|pages=341–343|doi=10.1145/360825.360861|mr=0375829|url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/pubs/p341-hirschberg.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript|bibcode=1985CACM...28...22S|citeseerx=10.1.1.348.4774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaptive variant ===

The dynamic variant is not the ideal implementation. An adaptive approach may reduce the amount of memory required and, in the best case, may reduce the time complexity to linear in the length of the shortest string, and, in the worst case, no more than quadratic in the length of the shortest string. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://bitbucket.org/clearer/iosifovich/ | title=Clearer / Iosifovich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approximation===
The Levenshtein distance between two strings of length {{mvar|n}} can be [[Approximation algorithm|approximated]] to within a factor

:&lt;math&gt;(\log n)^{O(1/\varepsilon)}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}} is a free parameter to be tuned, in time {{math|''O''(n&lt;sup&gt;1 + ''ε''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Andoni |first1=Alexandr |first2=Robert |last2=Krauthgamer |first3=Krzysztof |last3=Onak |title=Polylogarithmic approximation for edit distance and the asymmetric query complexity |conference=IEEE Symp. Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) |year=2010 |citeseerx=10.1.1.208.2079 |arxiv=1005.4033|bibcode=2010arXiv1005.4033A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational Complexity===
It has been shown that the Levenshtein distance of two strings of length {{mvar|n}} cannot be computed in time {{math|''O''(n&lt;sup&gt;2 - ''ε''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for any ε greater than zero unless the [[strong exponential time hypothesis]] is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Backurs |first1=Arturs |first2=Piotr |last2=Indyk |title= Edit Distance Cannot Be Computed in Strongly Subquadratic Time (unless SETH is false) |conference=Forty-Seventh Annual ACM on Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) |year=2015 | arxiv=1412.0348|bibcode=2014arXiv1412.0348B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spatial Levenshtein Distance===
By its definition, the Levenshtein distance is one-dimensional (it is used to measure string distance between only one pair of strings each time). It was made two-dimensional by Papadimitriou (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ecoinf.2009.01.001 |title=Modelling spatial landscape complexity using the Levenshtein algorithm |journal=Ecological Informatics |volume=4 |pages=48–55 |year=2009 |last1=Papadimitriou |first1=Fivos }}&lt;/ref&gt; who gave a formula for the calculation of spatial complexity of a 2-dimensional map from the Levenshtein distances of strings representing horizontal and vertical stripes of the map. It was thus shown that this (Papadimitriou-Levenshtein) measure can as well serve to evaluate a map's spatial complexity and, in this way, was created a Spatial Levenshtein Distance.

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Lovers of Valdaro.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Excavation of archaeological dig from [[Mantua, Italy]].|alt=Lovers of Valdaro]] --&gt;The '''Lovers of Valdaro''', also known as the "'''Valdaro Lovers'''," are a pair of human [[skeleton]]s dated as approximately 6,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Time | title=6,000 Years Later, the 'Lovers of Valdaro' Need a New Home | author = La Stampa / Worldcrunch 	 | url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2092970,00.html | date=September 13, 2011 | accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were discovered by archaeologists at a [[Neolithic tomb]] in San Giorgio near [[Mantua]], Italy, in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Reuters | title=Scientists to save 5,000-year-old embrace | author = Phil Stewart | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/02/14/us-italy-embrace-idUSL12831255020070214 | date=February 12, 2007 | accessdate=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=www.stonepages.com | title=Prehistoric skeletons found locked in eternal embrace | author = | url=http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002264.html | date=February 11, 2007 | accessdate=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two skeletons appear to have died or were interred facing each other with arms around each other, thus reminiscent of a "[[Sexual partner|lovers']] [[Physical intimacy|embrace]]".

Archaeologist Elena Maria Menotti led the excavation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Daily Mail| title=Locked in an eternal embrace | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-434454/Locked-eternal-embrace.html | date=February 8, 2007 | accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that the pair are a male and female no older than 20 years old at death and approximately {{convert|1.57|m|abbr=on}} in height.

The male skeleton was found with a flint arrowhead near the neck. The female had a long flint blade along the thigh, plus two flint knives under the pelvis. [[Osteology|Osteological]] examination found no evidence of violent death, no fractures, and no microtrauma, so the most likely explanation is the flint tools were buried along with the people as grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher= | title=Neolithic lovers seek new home | author = | url=http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12797 | date=September 13, 2011 | accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years after their discovery, on 11 April 2014 they were permanently displayed inside a glass case in the National Archaeological Museum of Mantua, museum within the perimeter of the [[Ducal palace, Mantua|Ducal palace of Mantova]].

The skeletons were displayed briefly in public for the first time in September 2011 at the entrance of  National Archaeological Museum of Mantua, thanks to the effort of the association Lovers in Mantua which is seeking a permanent home for the ancient couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher= | title=6,000-Year-Old Lovers Make Debut In Italy | author = | url=http://jezebel.com/5839639/6000-year-old-lovers-make-debut-in-italy | date=September 13, 2011 | accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohawk''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|h|ɔː|k}};&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kanien’kéha'', "[language] of the Flint Place") is a threatened, yet resilient [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]] currently spoken by around 3,500 people of the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk nation]], located primarily in [[Canada]]  (southern [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]), the [[Haudenosaunne Confederacy]] and to a lesser extent in the [[United States]] (western and northern [[New York (state)|New York]]).

==Name==
The word "Mohawk" is an [[exonym]]. In the Mohawk language, the people say that they are from ''Kanien'kehá:ka'' or "Flint Stone Place" or "People of the Flint Nation".&lt;ref name="First3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstvoices.com/en/Kanienkeha-Mohawk-EN|title=FirstVoices-Kanienkeha/Mohawk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mohawks were extremely wealthy traders, as other nations in their confederacy needed their flint for tool-making. Their Algonquian-speaking neighbors (and competitors), the People of ''Muh-heck Heek Ing'' ("food-area place"), a people called by the Dutch "[[Mohicans]]" or "Mahicans", called the People of Ka-nee-en Ka "Maw Unk Lin" or ''Bear People''. The Dutch heard and wrote that as "Mohawks" and so the People of Kan-ee-en Ka are often referred to as ''Mohawks''. The Dutch also referred to the Mohawk as ''Egils'' or ''Maquas''. The [[French people|French]] adapted those terms as ''Aigniers'' or ''Maquis'', or called them by the generic ''Iroquois''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==History==
The Mohawks comprised the largest and most powerful of the original [[Iroquois|Five Nations]], controlling a vast area of land on the eastern frontier of the Iroquois Confederacy. The [[North Country, New York|North Country]] and [[Adirondacks|Adirondack]] region of present-day [[Upstate New York]] would have constituted the greater part of the Mohawk-speaking area lasting until the end of the 18th century.

===Alexander Graham Bell===
The Scottish scientist [[Alexander Graham Bell]], one of the inventors of the [[telephone]], was greatly interested in the human voice: when he came across the [[Six Nations 40, Ontario|Six Nations Reserve]] across the river at [[Onondaga (village)|Onondaga]], he learned the Mohawk language and translated its then unwritten vocabulary into [[Visible Speech]] symbols for the first time. For his work, Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] headdress and danced traditional dances.&lt;ref&gt;Groundwater, Jennifer. ''Alexander Graham Bell: The Spirit of Invention''. Calgary: Altitude Publishing, 2005. {{ISBN|1-55439-006-0}}; p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
[[File:Mohawk language stop sign.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Mohawk language stop sign.]]
The Mohawk language is currently classified as threatened, and the number of native speakers has continually declined over the past several years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/18/language/moh/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohawk has the largest number of speakers among the [[Iroquois|Northern Iroquoian]] languages, and today it is the only one with more than a thousand remaining speakers.  At [[Akwesasne]], residents have begun a language immersion school (pre-K to grade 8) in ''Kanien’kéha'' to revive the language. With their children learning it, parents and other family members are taking language classes, too.

A Mohawk language immersion school was established.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mohawkcommunity.com/languageimmersion.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mohawk parents, concerned with the lack of culture-based education in public and parochial schools, founded the Akwesasne Freedom School in 1979. Six years later, the school implemented a Mohawk language immersion curriculum based on a traditional cycle of fifteen seasonal ceremonies, and on the Mohawk Thanksgiving Address, or Ohén:ton Karihwatékwen, "The words before all else." Every morning, teachers and students gather in the hallway to recite the Thanksgiving Address in Mohawk.&lt;ref&gt;http://ourmothertongues.org/language/Mohawk/7&lt;/ref&gt;

An adult immersion program was also created in 1985 to address the issue of intergenerational fluency decline of the Mohawk language.&lt;ref&gt;http://mje.mcgill.ca/article/view/8645.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kanatsiohareke''' (Gah-nah-jo-ha-lay-gay) is a small [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]]/''Kanienkahaka'' community on the north bank of the [[Mohawk River]], west of [[Fonda, New York]]. The name means "Place of the clean pot."&lt;sup&gt;[[Kanatsiohareke#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Kanatsiohareke was created to be a "[[Carlisle Indian Boarding School]] in Reverse", teaching Mohawk language and culture.&lt;sup&gt;[[Kanatsiohareke|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Located at the ancient homeland of the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk), it was re-established in September 1993 under the leadership of Thomas R. Porter (Sakokwenionkwas-"The One Who Wins").&lt;sup&gt;[[Kanatsiohareke#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; The community must raise their own revenue and frequently hold cultural presentations, workshops, and academic events, including an annual Strawberry Festival.&lt;sup&gt;[[Kanatsiohareke#cite note-4|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; A craft shop on site features genuine handmade Native crafts from all over North America.

The primary mission of the community is to try to preserve traditional values, culture, language and lifestyles in the guidance of the ''Kaienerekowa'' (Great Law of Peace).&lt;sup&gt;[[Kanatsiohareke#cite note-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Kanatsiohareke, Inc. is a [[non-profit organization]] under IRS code 501c3.

In 2006, over 600 people were reported to speak the language in Canada, many of them elderly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Statistics Canada, 2006 Census of Population, Statistics Canada catalogue no. 97-558-XCB2006015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Kahnawake]]''' is located at a metropolitan location, near central [[Montreal]], [[Canada]]. As Kahnawake is located near Montreal, many individuals speak both English and French, and this has contributed to a decline in the use of Mohawk language over the past century. The Mohawk Survival School, the first immersion program was established in 1979. The school's mission was to revitalize Mohawk language. To examine how successful the program had been, questionnaire was given to the Kahnawake residents following the first year. The results indicated that teaching towards younger generation have been successful and showed an increase in the ability to speak the language in private settings, as well as an increase in the mixing of Mohawk in English conversations were found.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.brandonu.ca/cjns/12.2/hoover.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current number of speakers===
In 2011, there were approximately 3,500 speakers of Mohawk, primarily in Quebec, Ontario and western New York.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, Christopher and R. E. Asher, ed. ''Atlas of World Languages'' (New York: Routelege, 1994) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mohawk|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/moh|website=Ethnologue|accessdate=Jan 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immersion (monolingual) classes for young children at [[Akwesasne]] and other reserves are helping to train new first-language speakers. The importance of immersion classes among parents grew after the passage of [[Charter of the French Language|Bill 101]], and in 1979 the Mohawk Survival School was established to facilitate language training at the high school level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author= Michael Hoover|author-link= |authors= |date= |title= The Revival of the Mohawk Language in Kahnawake |url= http://www3.brandonu.ca/cjns/12.2/hoover.pdf|publisher= |page= |docket= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage in popular culture===
Mohawk dialogue features prominently in [[Ubisoft Montreal]]'s 2012 [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[open world]] [[video game]] ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', through the game's main character, the half-Mohawk, half-English [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]], also called Connor, and members of his native [[Mohawk people#Mohawk communities today|Kanièn:ke]] village around the times of the [[American revolution]]. Ratonhnhaké:ton was voiced and modelled by [[Crow tribe|Crow]] actor [[Noah Watts|Noah Bulaagawish Watts]]. [[Hiawatha]], the leader of the [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] civilization in ''[[Sid Meier's Civilization V]]'', voiced by Kanentokon Hemlock, speaks modern Mohawk.

The stories of Mohawk language learners are also chronicled in 'Raising The Words', a short documentary film that explores personal experiences with Mohawk language revitalization in [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory|Tyendinaga]], a Mohawk community roughly 200 kilometres east of [[Toronto, Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raisingthewords.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; The film is set to be shown at the 4th annual Ethnografilm festival in [[Paris, France]].

==Dialects==
Mohawk has three major dialects: Western (Ohswé:ken and Kenhté:ke), Central (Ahkwesáhsne), and Eastern (Kahnawà:ke and Kanehsatà:ke); the differences between them are largely phonological. These are related to the major Mohawk territories since the eighteenth century. The pronunciation of {{IPA|/r/}} and several consonant clusters may differ in the dialects.

==Phonology==
The phoneme inventory of Mohawk is as follows (using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]). Phonological representation (underlying forms) are in /slashes/, and the standard Mohawk orthography is in bold.

===Consonants===
An interesting feature of Mohawk (and Iroquoian) phonology is that there are no [[labial consonant|labials]], except in a few adoptions from French and English, where {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[p]}} appear (e.g., '''mátsis''' ''matches'' and '''aplám''' ''Abraham''); these sounds are late additions to Mohawk phonology and were introduced after widespread European contact.

All clusters can occur word-medially; those on a red background can also occur word-initially.

The consonants {{IPA|/k/, /t/}} and the clusters {{IPA|/ts kw/}} are pronounced voiced before any voiced sound (i.e. a vowel or {{IPA|/j/}}). They are voiceless at the end of a word or before a voiceless sound. {{IPA|/s/}} is voiced word initially and between vowels.

:''that'' – '''thí:ken''' {{IPA|[ˈthiːɡʌ̃]}}

''i'', ''e'', ''a'', and ''o'' are [[oral vowel]]s, while ''{{IPA|ʌ̃}}'' and ''{{IPA|ũ}}'' (see [[help:IPA]]) are [[Nasal vowel|nasalized]]; oral versions of ''{{IPA|ʌ̃}}'' and ''{{IPA|ũ}}'' do not occur in the language.

==Grammar==
[[File:Mohawk no-swimming sign.jpg|left|thumb|A warning sign in Mohawk]]
Mohawk words tend to be longer on average than words in English, primarily because they consist of a large amount of [[morphemes]], or 'meaningful parts'. 

Mohawk expresses a number of distinctions on its pronominal elements: person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, dual, plural), gender (masculine, feminine/indefinite, feminine/neuter) and [[Inclusive and exclusive we|inclusivity/exclusivity]] on the first person dual and plural. Pronominal information is encoded in prefixes on the verbs; separate pronoun words are used for emphasis. There are three main paradigms of pronominal prefixes: subjective (with dynamic verbs), objective (with stative verbs), and transitive.

There are three core components to the Mohawk proposition: the noun, the predicate, and the particle.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Mohawk words can be composed of many morphemes. What is expressed in English in many words can often be expressed by just one Mohawk word, a phenomenon known as [[polysynthetic language | polysynthesis]].

'''Nouns''' &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Grammar Of Awkwesasne Mohawk|last = Bonvillain|first = Nancy|publisher = National Museum of Man, National Museums of Canada|year = 1973|isbn = |location = |pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Thousand Words Of Mohawk|last = Michelson|first = Günther|publisher = National Museum of Man, National Museums Of Canada|year = 1973|isbn = |location = |pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = One thousand useful Mohawk words|last = Maracle|first = David|publisher = Audio-Forum|year = |isbn = |location = Guilford, Conn|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nouns are given the following form in Mohawk:
{| class="wikitable"
!Nominal Prefix
!Noun Stem
!Nominal Suffix
|}
Noun prefixes give information relating to gender, animacy, number and person, and identify the word as a noun.

For example:

1) '''o''''nenste   "corn"

2) '''o'''ien'kwa  "tobacco"

Here, the prefix  ''o-'' is generally found on nouns found in natural environments. Another prefix exists which marks objects that are made by humans.

3) '''ka'''nhoha     "door"

4) '''ka''''khare  "slip, skirt"

Here, the prefix ''ka-'' is generally found on manmade things. Phonological variation amongst the Mohawk dialects also gives rise to the prefix ''ga-'' to generally denote human made objects.

Noun roots are similar to nouns in English in that the noun root in Mohawk and the noun in English have similar meanings.

(Caughnawaha)

5) –eri-  "heart"

6) –hi- "river"

7) –itshat- "cloud"

These noun roots are bare. There is no information other than the noun root itself. It should be noted that morphemes can not occur individually. That is, to be well-formed and grammatical, ''-eri-'' needs pronominal prefixes, or the root can be incorporated into a predicate phrase.

Nominal suffixes aren't necessary for a well-formed noun phrase. The suffixes give information relating to location and attributes. For example:

Locative Suffix:

8) i. onu'ta'               "hill"

ii. onuta''''ke'''  "'''on''' the hill"

9) i. onekwvhsa'       "blood"

ii. onekwvhsa''''ke'''   "'''in''' the blood"

Here the suffix &lt; -ke &gt; denotes location.

Attributive Suffix:

10) kvjy'                   "fish"

11) kvja''''ko'wa'''       "sturgeon" or "big fish"

Here, the suffix ''-ko'wa'' denotes an augmentative suffix, which increases the attribute of the noun in question.

'''Verbs''' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mohawk verbs are one of the more complex parts of the language, composed of many morphemes that describe grammatical relations. The verb takes the following structure:
{| class="wikitable"
!Pre-Pronominal Prefix
!Pronominal Prefix
!Reflexive And Reciprocal Particle
!Incorporated Noun Root
!Verb Root
!Suffixes

Mohawk grammar allows for whole propositions to be expressed by one word, which we classify as a verb. The other core elements (subjects, objects, etc.) can be incorporated into the verb. Well-formed verb phrases contain at the bare minimum a verb root and a pronominal prefix. The rest of the elements are not necessary.

Tense, aspect and modality are expressed via suffixes on the verb phrase as well.

Some examples:

12) katorats                 "I hunt"

k-atorat-s

I-hunt-habitual ASP

This is composed of three parts; the pronominal prefix, the verb root and a suffix which marks aspect. Mohawk seems to prefer aspect markers to tense to express grammaticalisation in time.

13) nya'tsvshayaya'ke'                   "…where he will cross over again from here to there…"

n-ya'-t-v-s-ha-yahya'k-e'

partitive-translocative-dualic-future-iterative-noun-verb root-suffix

"Where over here to there will again he cross."

This example shows multiple prefixes that can be affixed to the verb root, but certain affixes are forbidden from coexisting together. For example, the aorist and the future tense affix will not be found on the same well-formed sentence.

14)  vsenatara'                    "You will make a visit"

v-se-natahr-a'

future tense+ nominative pronoun + verb root + momentary ASP suffix

15) asenatara'                     "You should make a visit"

a-se-natahr-a'

conditional mood prefix + nominative pronoun + verb root + momentary suffix

16) sanatahrune'                 "You were visiting"

Sa-natahr-u-hne'

Accusative Pronoun + verb root + stative suffix + momentary suffix

Here, different prefixes and suffixes are used that mark tense, aspect and modality.

Most grammatical relations in Mohawk are expressed through various different affixes onto a verb. Subjects, objects, and relationships between subjects and objects are given their own affixes. In Mohawk, each transitive relationship between subjects and objects are given their own prefix. For example:

17) a: ku-noruhkwa

I-you + love

"I love you"

b: ri-noruhkwa

I-him + love

"I love him"

c: ke-noruhkwa

I-it/her + love

"I love it/her"

Each of these affixes are denoting a transitive relationship between two things There are more affixes for denoting transitive relationships like "we-they", they-us (inclusive/exclusive), etc.

'''Noun incorporation'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One of the features of Mohawk called ''noun incorporation'' allows a verb to absorb a noun into it. When incorporation happens, an epenthetic ''a'' can appear between the noun root and the verb root. For example:

18) Owira'a wahrake' ne o'wahru

Baby      ate        the  meat

With noun incorporation:

19) Owira'a wah'''a'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'wahrake'

Baby     meat-ate

20) Wa'eksohare'                 "She dish-washed"   ks = dish, ohare=wash

21) Wa'kenakt'''a'''hninu'           "I bed-bought"   nakt=bed + a (increment) + hninu=buy

22) Wahana'tar'''a'''kwetare'     "He bread-cut"           Na'tar=bread + a (increment) + kwetar=cut

Most of these examples take the epenthetic vowel ''a''; it can be omitted if the incorporated noun doesn't give rise a complex consonant cluster in the middle of the word.

==Orthography==
[[File:Trilingual plaque on the Grand River, Cambridge, Ontario.jpg|thumb|Plaque in English, Mohawk, and French describing the Grand River. Plaque located in Galt, Cambridge, Ontario]]
The Mohawk alphabet consists of these letters: '''a e h i k n o r s t w y''' along with '''’''' and ''':'''. The orthography was standardized in 1993.&lt;ref name="Standarization"&gt;[http://www.kanienkehaka.com/msp/msp.htm "Mohawk Language Standardization Project", Kanienkehaka]&lt;/ref&gt; The standard allows for some variation of how the language is represented, and the clusters {{IPA|/ts(i)/}}, {{IPA|/tj/}}, and {{IPA|/ky/}} are written as pronounced in each community. The orthography matches the phonological analysis as above except:
*The glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is written with an apostrophe '''’''', it is often omitted at the end of words, especially in Eastern dialect where it is typically not pronounced.
*{{IPA|/dʒ/}}
**{{IPA|/dʒ/}} is written '''ts''' in the Eastern dialect (reflecting pronunciation). ''Seven'' is '''tsá:ta''' {{IPA|[dzaːda]}}.
**{{IPA|/dʒ/}} is written '''tsi''' in the Central dialect. ''Seven'' is '''tsiá:ta''' {{IPA|[dʒaːda]}}.
**{{IPA|/dʒ/}} is written '''tsy''' in the Western dialect. ''Seven'' is '''tsyá:ta''' {{IPA|[dʒaːda]}}.
*{{IPA|/j/}}
**{{IPA|/j/}} is typically written '''i''' in the Central and Eastern dialects. ''Six'' is '''ià:ia’k''' {{IPA|[jàːjaʔk]}}.
**{{IPA|/j/}} is usually written '''y''' in the Western dialect. ''Six'' is '''yà:ya’k''' {{IPA|[jàːjaʔk]}}.
*The vowel {{IPA|/ʌ̃/}} is written '''en''', as in ''one'' '''énska''' {{IPA|[ʌ̃ska]}}.
*The vowel {{IPA|/ũ/}} is written '''on''', as in ''eight'' '''sha’té:kon''' {{IPA|[shaʔdɛːɡũ]}}.
*In cases where the vowel /e/ or /o/ is followed by an /n/ in the same syllable, the /n/ is written with a low-macron accent: '''keṉhó:tons''' (I am closing a door). If the '''ṉ''' did not have the accent, the sequence {{angle bracket|en}} would be pronounced {{IPA|[ʌ̃]}}.
The low-macron accent is not a part of standard orthography and isn't used by the Central or Eastern dialects.
In standard orthography, /h/ is written before /n/ to create the [en] or [on]: '''kehnhó:tons''' 'I am closing it'.

===Stress, length, and tone===
Stress, vowel length and tone are linked together in Mohawk. There are three kinds of stressed vowels: short-high tone, long-high tone, and long-falling tone. Stress is always written and occurs only once per word.
*Short-high tone usually (but not always) appears in closed syllables or before /h/. It is written with an acute accent: ''fruit'' '''káhi''', ''road'' '''oháha'''.
*Long-rising tone generally occurs in open syllables. It is written with a combination acute accent and colon: ''town'' '''kaná:ta''', ''man'' '''rón:kwe'''. Notice that when it is one of the nasal vowels which is long, the colon appears after the '''n'''.
*Long-falling tone is the result of the word stress falling on a vowel which comes before a {{IPA|/ʔ/}} or {{IPA|/h/}} + a consonant (there may be, of course, exceptions to this and other rules). The underlying {{IPA|/ʔ/}} or {{IPA|/h/}} reappears when stress is placed elsewhere. It is written with a grave accent and colon: ''stomach'' '''onekwèn:ta''' (from {{IPA|/onekwʌ̃ʔta/}}).

The '''NoHo Arts District''' is a community in [[North Hollywood]], [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], that is home to contemporary theaters, art galleries, cafes, and shops. The community is generally bounded by Hatteras Street to the north, Cahuenga Blvd to the east, Tujunga Ave to the west, and Camarillo Street to the south. The area features more than twenty professional theaters, producing new work and classics, diverse art galleries, public art, and professional dance studios. The district also features the largest concentration of music recording venues west of the Mississippi. A Metro Rail station is located here, the [[North Hollywood station]] of the Red Line, and serves as the terminus of the Metro Orange Line busway.

Business and theater owners in the Universal City/North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce established a theater and arts district in 1992 with support from the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs. They chose "NoHo", a play off the well-known [[SoHo|SoHo Arts District]] neighborhood of New York City.

Today, The NoHo Arts District, in conjunction with greater [[North Hollywood]], is being transformed into a regional center, in large part as a result of the construction of Metro Stations for the [[LACMTA Red Line|Red Line]] and the [[LACMTA Orange Line|Orange Line]], two lines that have made the neighborhood into a regional hub for the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Medium- and high-density developments are being built around the Metro Station, making the Arts District a center of citywide development, with the intent of creating a walkable [[New Urbanism|urban village]]. North Hollywood's landscape (and the Art's District as a result) has been transformed in recent years, with condominium towers (including a fifteen-story building on [[Lankershim Boulevard]] being built in the midst of older one-story bungalows and small apartment complexes.

The theater district includes two new large venues that expand upon existing theaters, the newly redesigned NoHo Arts Center (formerly the American Renegade Theatre) and the redesigned Historical El Portal. They add to the existing 31 theaters located in and around the NoHo Arts District. NoHo Commons, developed by J.H. Snyder Company, is located near the NoHo Arts District's commercial core and subway station. The $100-million, 292-unit loft apartment project by Snyder was the first segment to be completed of NoHo Commons, part of a "transit village" taking form at the terminus of the Metro Red Line subway and the Orange Line busway. The NoHo Commons construction and development consisted of three phases, completing with the construction of a [[Laemmle Theatres|Laemmle Theatre]]. Phase III also consisted of the construction of an eight-story office on the corner of Lankershim and Weddington in 2009. The building's primary tenant is currently the Art Institute of California-Hollywood. NoHo 14, a 180-unit, fourteen-story apartment building, was built in 2004 as one of the first large-scale developments in the neighborhood.

The historic North Hollywood train depot at Lankershim and Chandler Boulevards was restored in 2014 for $3.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segura|first1=Daniella|title=Metro finishes $3.6 million makeover of Lankershim Depot|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/10/30/47757/metro-finishes-3-6-million-makeover-of-lankershim/|accessdate=July 25, 2016|work=Southern California Public Radio|date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] standard design, a One Story Combination Depot No. 15 or 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southern Pacific Lines Standard-Design Depots|last=Bender|first=Henry E., Jr.|publisher=Signature Press|year=2013|isbn=9781930013339|location=Berkeley and Wilton, California|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The train depot, dating to 1896, sits on land owned by the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], across from the Metro Red Line subway station and next to the terminus of the Orange Line bus line.

Currently the NoHo Arts District, in conjunction with the Community Redevelopment Agency-Los Angeles, is working on beautification efforts to make the area more appealing to businesses. The current focus is primarily on revamping store fronts on Lankershim Blvd and Magnolia Blvd with Burbank Blvd to follow.

In the future, North Hollywood plans a $1 billion [[mixed-use development]] at Lankershim and Chandler, surrounding the Metro Red and Orange line terminals. The project would re-develop {{convert|15.6|acre|m2}} with {{convert|1720000|sqft|m2}} of commercial and residential space, including 562 residential units and three high-rise office towers. The project was awarded to Lowe Enterprises by the Los Angeles Metro board and will be designed by architects AC Martin Partners.

The '''''Patrologia Latina''''' ([[Latin]] for ''The Latin Patrology'') is an enormous collection of the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] and other ecclesiastical writers published by [[Jacques-Paul Migne]] between 1841 and 1855, with indices published between 1862 and 1865. It is also known as the '''Latin series''' as it formed one half of Migne's '''''Patrologiae Cursus Completus''''', the other part being the ''[[Patrologia Graeca|Patrologia Graeco-Latina]]'' of [[patristic]] and [[Byzantine Greek|medieval Greek]] works with their (sometimes non-matching) medieval [[Latin]] translations.

Although consisting of reprints of old editions, which often contain mistakes and do not comply with modern standards of scholarship, the series, due to its availability (it is present in many academic libraries) and the fact that it incorporates many texts of which no modern critical edition is available, is still widely used by scholars of the [[Middle Ages]] and is in this respect comparable to the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''.

The ''Patrologia Latina'' includes Latin works spanning a millennium, from [[Tertullian]] (d. 230) to [[Pope Innocent III]] (d. 1216), edited in roughly chronological order in 217 volumes; 
volumes 1 to 73, from Tertullian to [[Gregory of Tours]], were published from 1841 to 1849, and volumes 74 to 217, from [[Pope Gregory I]] to Innocent III, from 1849 to 1855. 
Although the collection ends with Innocent III,&lt;ref&gt;It includes some authors of the second quarter of the 13th century, such as [[John Halgren of Abbeville]], and (exceptionally) [[John of Garland]] (died c. 1270) in volume 150, among authors of the 12th century.&lt;/ref&gt;
Migne originally wanted to include documents all the way up to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; this task proved too great, but some later commentaries or documents associated with earlier works were included.

Most of the works are ecclesiastic in nature, but there are also documents of literary, historical or linguistic (such as the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] bible in vol. 18) interest.

The printing plates for the ''Patrologia'' were destroyed by fire in 1868, but with help from the Garnier printing house they were restored and new editions were printed, beginning in the 1880s. These reprints did not always correspond exactly with the original series either in quality or internal arrangement, and caution should be exercised when referencing to the ''PL'' in general.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://pld.chadwyck.co.uk/help/about2.htm ProQuest – Central To Research Around The World]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peronism''' ({{lang-es|peronismo}}) or '''Justicialism''' (''justicialismo'') is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] political movement based on the political ideology and legacy of former President [[Juan Perón|Juan Domingo Perón]] and his second wife [[Eva Perón]].

The Peronist's [[Justicialist Party]] (''Partido Justicialista'') derives its name from the concept of [[social justice]] ({{lang-es|justicia social}}).

Since its inception in 1946, Peronist candidates have won nine of the 12 presidential elections from which they have not been banned. As of 2018, Perón was the only Argentine to have been elected president three times.

==Overview==
The pillars of the Peronist ideal, known as the "three flags", are social justice, economic independence and political sovereignty. Peronism can be described as a [[third position]] [[ideology]] as it rejects both [[capitalism]] and [[communism]]. Peronism espouses [[corporatism]] and thus aims to mediate tensions between the classes of society, with the state responsible for negotiating compromise in conflicts between managers and workers.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

However, it is a generally ill-defined ideology as different and sometimes contradictory sentiments are expressed in the name of Peronism. Today, the legacy and thought of Perón have transcended the confines of any single political party and bled into the broader political landscape of Argentina; therefore Peronists are usually described as a [[political movement]]. Traditionally, the Peronist movement has drawn its strongest support from the [[working class]] and sympathetic [[Trade union|unions]] and has been characterized as [[proletarian]] in nature.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

From the perspective of opponents, Peronism is an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] ideology. Perón was often compared to [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Dictator|dictators]], accused of [[demagoguery]] and his policies{{which|date=October 2018}} derided as [[populism|populist]]. Proclaiming himself the embodiment of nationality, Perón's government often silenced dissent by accusing opponents of being unpatriotic. The corporatist character of Peronism drew attacks from [[socialists]] who accused his administration of preserving capitalist exploitation and class division. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] rejected its modernist ideology and felt their status threatened by the ascent of the Peronist [[wiktionary:apparat|apparat]]. [[Liberalism|Liberals]] condemned the Perón regime's arbitrariness and dictatorial tendencies.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Defenders of Peronism also describe the [[doctrine]] as populist, albeit in the sense that they believe it embodies the interests of the masses and in particular the most vulnerable social strata. Admirers hold Perón in esteem for his administration's [[anti-imperialism]] and [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]] as well as its socially [[progressivism|progressive]] initiatives. Amongst other measures introduced by Perón's governments, [[social security]] was made universal while education was made free to all who qualified and working students were given one paid week before every major examination. Vast low-income housing projects were created and paid vacations became standard. All workers (including [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] employees) were guaranteed free medical care and half of their vacation-trip expenses and mothers-to-be received three paid months off prior to and after giving birth. Workers' recreation centers were also constructed throughout the country.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Perón's policies==
{{History of Argentina}}
Perón's ideas were widely embraced by a variety of different groups in Argentina across the political spectrum. Perón's personal views later became a burden on the ideology, see for example his [[anti-clericalism]], which did not strike a sympathetic chord with upper-class Argentinians.

Peronism is widely regarded as a form of corporate socialism, or "[[right-wing socialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/13/world/buenos-aires-journal-carlos-carlos-how-does-your-economy-sink.html "Buenos Aires Journal"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 13 January 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Perón's public speeches were consistently [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[populism|populist]]. It would be difficult to separate Peronism from [[corporate nationalism]], for Perón nationalized Argentina's large corporations, blurring distinctions between corporations and government. At the same time, the [[labor union]]s became corporate, ceding the right to strike in agreements with Perón as Secretary of Welfare in the military government from 1943–1945. In exchange, the state was to assume the role of negotiator between conflicting interests.

Peronism also lacked a strong interest in matters of [[foreign policy]] other than the belief that the political and economic influences of other nations should be kept out of Argentina—he was somewhat [[Isolationism|isolationist]]. Early in his presidency, Perón envisioned Argentina's role as a model for other countries in Latin America and beyond, but such ideas were ultimately abandoned. Despite his oppositional rhetoric, Perón frequently sought cooperation with the United States government on various issues.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Chronicle of an Inconclusive Negotiation: Perón, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank (1946–1955)|url=http://hahr.dukejournals.org/content/92/4/637.abstract|journal=Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Perón===
Political opponents sustain that Perón and his administration resorted to organized violence and dictatorial rule; that Perón showed contempt for any opponents; and regularly characterized them as traitors and agents of foreign powers. Perón maintained the institutions of democratic rule, but subverted freedoms through such actions as nationalizing the broadcasting system, centralizing the unions under his control and monopolizing the supply of newspaper print. At times, Perón also resorted to tactics such as illegally imprisoning opposition politicians and journalists, including [[Radical Civic Union]] leader [[Ricardo Balbin]]; and shutting down opposition papers, such as ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]''.

Perón's admiration for [[Benito Mussolini]] is well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Political Ideologies |last=Eatwell |first=Roger |year=1999 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-8264-5173-6 |pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars categorize Peronism as a [[Fascism|fascist]] ideology.&lt;ref name="peronism"&gt;Brennan, James P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AsuoVCbF7DgC&amp;q=Fayt#v=snippet&amp;q=Fayt&amp;f=false ''Peronism and Argentina'']. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlos Fayt]] believes that Peronism was just "an Argentine implementation of [[Italian fascism]]".&lt;ref name="peronism"/&gt; Hayes{{Clarify|reason=who is Hayes?|date=May 2016}} reaches the conclusion that "the Peronist movement produced a form of fascism that was distinctively Latin American".&lt;ref name="peronism"/&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of Peronism was the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. After Perón ascended to the presidency in 1946, Borges spoke before the Argentine Society of Writers (SADE) by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;Dictatorships breed oppression, dictatorships breed servility, dictatorships breed cruelty; more loathsome still is the fact that they breed idiocy. Bellboys babbling orders, portraits of [[caudillo]]s, prearranged cheers or insults, walls covered with names, unanimous ceremonies, mere discipline usurping the place of clear thinking... Fighting these sad monotonies is one of the duties of a writer. Need I remind readers of ''[[Martín Fierro]]'' or ''[[Don Segundo Sombra|Don Segundo]]'' that individualism is an old Argentine virtue.&lt;ref&gt;''Borges: A Life''. p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Attitudes towards Jews===
Perón's ideology was economic and political in character and did not feature the [[antisemitism]] of [[Nazism]].

Before Perón came to power in Argentina, the country had the largest Jewish population in Latin America. After becoming president, he invited members of the Jewish community to participate in his government. One of his advisors was [[José Ber Gelbard]], a Jewish man from Poland. Peronism did not have antisemitic or other bias.&lt;ref&gt;Crassweller, David. ''Perón and the Enigmas of Argentina''. W.W. Norton and Company. 1987. p. 221. {{ISBN|0-393-30543-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish Virtual Library]] writes that while Juan Perón had sympathized with the Axis powers, "Perón also expressed sympathy for Jewish rights and established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1949. Since then, more than 45,000 Jews have immigrated to Israel from Argentina".&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Rebecca. [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Argentina.html#WW2 "Post World War II"]. Jewish Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Inside Argentina from Perón to Menem'', author Laurence Levine, also former president of the U.S.–Argentine Chamber of Commerce, writes that "although anti-Semitism existed in Argentina, Perón's own views and his political associations were not anti-Semitic".&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Laurence. ''Inside Argentina from Perón to Menem: 1950–2000 From an American Point of View''. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; While Perón allowed many Nazi criminals to take refuge in Argentina, he also attracted many Jewish immigrants. Argentina has a Jewish population of over 200,000 citizens, the largest in Latin America and one of the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Valente, Marcela. [http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/education/diplomacy/argentina-75/continuing-efforts-conceal/ "Continuing Efforts to Conceal Anti-Semitic Past"]. IPS-Inter Press Service. 27 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peronism after Perón==
===The fall of Perón===
A military and civilian coup, the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'', led by General [[Eduardo Lonardi]], overthrew the Perón regime in 1955. During the coup, Lonardi drew analogies between Perón and [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]. Lonardi used the quote "neither victors nor vanquished" ({{lang-es|link=no|ni vencedores ni vencidos}}), which was used by [[Justo José de Urquiza]] after deposing Rosas in the [[battle of Caseros]]. The official perspective was that Perón was "the second tyranny", the first one being Rosas; and that both ones should be equally rejected and conversely both governments that ousted them should be praised. For this end, they draw the line of historical continuity "[[May Revolution|May]] – [[Battle of Caseros|Caseros]] – [[Revolución Libertadora|Libertadora]]", matching the coup with the May Revolution and the defeat of Rosas. This approach backfired. Perón was highly popular and the military coup unpopular, so Peronists embraced the comparison established between Rosas and Perón, but viewing him with a positive light instead.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto. pp. 278–281.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist historians draw then their own line of historical continuity "[[José de San Martín|San Martín]] – [[Juan Manuel de Rosas|Rosas]] – [[Juan Perón|Perón]]".&lt;ref name="tres"&gt;Chaneton. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of Perón, who lived for 16 years in exile in [[Spain under Franco|Francoist Spain]], is an important key to understanding Peronism. After he went into exile, he could be invoked by a variety of Argentine sectors opposed to the current state of affairs. In particular, the [[personality cult]] of [[Eva Perón]] was conserved by supporters while despised by the "national [[bourgeoisie]]". In the 1960s, John William Cooke's writings became an important source of left-wing revolutionary Peronism. Left-wing Peronism was represented by many organizations, from the [[Montoneros]] and the [[Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas]] to the Peronist Youth, the Frente Revolucionario Peronista and the Revolutionary Peronist Youth, passing by Peronismo en Lucha or Peronismo de Base, which supported a [[Marxist]] viewpoint.&lt;ref name="Navarrazo"&gt;Servetto, Alice. [http://bibliotecavirtual.unl.edu.ar:8180/publicaciones/bitstream/1/681/1/ES_9_17_1999_pag_91_109.pdf "El derrumbe temprano de la democracia en Córdoba: Obregón Cano y el golpe policial (1973-1974)"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706083051/http://bibliotecavirtual.unl.edu.ar:8180/publicaciones/bitstream/1/681/1/ES_9_17_1999_pag_91_109.pdf|date=6 July 2011}} ''Estudios Sociales''. n° 17. Late 1999, revised paper of a 1997 conference at the [[National University of La Pampa]], 19 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, older Peronists formed the base of the orthodox bureaucracy, represented by the Unión Obrera Metalúrgica ([[Augusto Vandor]], famous for his 1965 slogan "For a Peronism without Perón" and declaring as well that "to save Perón, one has to be against Perón", or [[José Ignacio Rucci]]). Another current was formed by the "62 Organizaciones 'De pie junto a Perón'", led by [[José Alonso (trade unionist)|José Alonso]] and opposed to the right-wing Peronist unionist movement. In the early 1970s, left-wing Peronism rejected liberal democracy and political pluralism as the mask of bourgeois domination. The anti-communist right-wing Peronism also rejected it in the name of corporatism, claiming to return to a "Christian and humanist, popular, national socialism".&lt;ref name="Navarrazo"/&gt;

===Perón restored===
By 1970, many groups from opposite sides of the political spectrum had come to support Perón, from the left-wing and Catholic [[Montoneros]] to the fascist-leaning and strongly antisemitic [[Tacuara Nationalist Movement]], one of Argentina's first [[guerrilla]] movements. In March 1973, [[Héctor José Cámpora]], who had been named as Perón's personal delegate, was [[Argentine general election, March 1973|elected President of Argentina]], paving the way for the return of Perón from Spain. A few months after Perón's return and the subsequent [[Ezeiza massacre]] during which the Peronist Left and Right violently clashed, [[Argentine general election, September 1973|new elections]] were held in September with Perón elected president and his third wife Isabel vice president.&lt;ref name=Navarrazo/&gt;

José Cámpora, a left-wing Peronist, had been replaced temporarily by interim President [[Raúl Alberto Lastiri]] while Perón had chosen to openly support the Peronist right. On 1 October 1973, Senator Humberto Martiarena, who was the national secretary of the Superior Council of the National Justicialist Movement, publicized a document giving directives to confront "subversives, terrorist and Marxist groups" which had allegedly initiated a "war" inside the Peronist organizations.&lt;ref name=Navarrazo/&gt; From then on, the Superior Council took a firm grip on the Peronist organizations to expel the Left from it.&lt;ref name=Navarrazo/&gt;

On that same day, a meeting took place among President [[Raúl Lastiri]], Interior Minister Benito Llambí, Social Welfare Minister [[José López Rega]], general secretary of the Presidency José Humberto Martiarena and various provincial governors, which has been alleged to have been the foundational act of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] [[death squad]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaggero, Manuel Justo.  [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-80601-2007-02-19.html "El general en su laberinto"]. ''[[Pagina/12]]''. 19 February 
2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perón's health was failing throughout his third and final term, which ended abruptly with his death and the succession of his wife to the presidency on 1 July 1974, but she was ousted by the military in another ''coup d'état'' in 1976, paving the way for the ensuing dictatorship's '"[[National Reorganization Process]]" and the subsequent "[[Dirty War]]" against everyone deemed [[subversion|subversive]], especially leftists, including left-wing Peronists.

===Menem years===
[[File:Kirchner en Gualeguaychú 5-may-2006 3-presidencia-govar.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Néstor Kirchner]] addressing a multitude at Gualeguaychú]]
The official Peronist party is the [[Justicialist Party]] (PJ), which was the only Peronist party for a long time. During the government of [[Carlos Menem]], a group of legislators led by [[Carlos Álvarez (politician)|Carlos Álvarez]] known as the "Group of 8" left the party, claiming that the government was not following Peronist doctrines. They created a new party, the [[Broad Front (Argentina)|Broad Front]].

A short time later, [[José Octavio Bordón]] left the PJ as well, fearing that he might lose a [[primary election]] against Menem and thus he created his own party to take part in the [[Argentine general election, 1995|1995 elections]] and allied with Álvarez' Broad Front in the [[Front for a Country in Solidarity]] (Frepaso) coalition. Similar breakaway movements followed frequently after that, creating many small parties which were led by single politicians claiming to be the authentic inheritors of Peronism.

===Kirchnerism===
{{Further|Kirchnerism}}
The PJ did not participate as such during the [[Argentine general election, 2003|2003 elections]]. The party allowed all three precandidates to run for the general elections, using small parties created for that purpose. [[Néstor Kirchner]] won the elections running on a [[Front for Victory]] ticket. As he did not disband his party after the election, Kirchnerism relies on both the PJ and the Front for Victory.

In 2004, Chilean [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democrat]] [[Ignacio Walker]] wrote a column in ''[[El Mercurio]]'' criticizing Peronism stating it had "Fascistoid", "authoritarian" and "corporative" traits. He added that "I tend to think the real wall that separates Chile from Argentina is not the Andes but the  legacy of Peronism and its perverse logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2004/10/04/160124/ignacio-walker-nuestros-vecinos-argentinos.html|title=Ignacio Walker: "Nuestros vecinos argentinos"|last=Walker|first=Ignacio|date=6 May 2004|newspaper=[[El Mercurio]]|access-date=26 May 2014|location=Santiago, Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after Walker had written this column, he was appointed [[chancellor]] and the surfacing of his previous statements caused a diplomatic impasse between Chile and Peronist-ruled Argentina. A similar situation happened again in 2006, when it was made known that Chilean minister [[Andrés Velasco]] had referred to some Peronist leaders as having "fascist traits" and had supported Walker's analysis in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/internacional/2006/03/20/214075/resurgen-en-argentina-polemicos-dichos-de-velasco-sobre-el-peronismo.html|title=Resurgen en Argentina polémicos dichos de Velasco sobre el peronismo|last=|first=|date=20 March 2006|newspaper=[[El Mercurio]]|access-date=26 May 2014|location=Santiago, Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Protagonize is an [[online community]] and [[self-publishing]] platform, launched in December, 2007 by creator Nick Bouton &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/nick-bouton|title=Nick Bouton on Crunch Base|publisher=Crunch base |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a home for [[Choose Your Own Adventure]]-style branching stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kyllo|first=Blaine|title=Web community spins Protagonize's yarns|url=https://www.straight.com/life/web-community-spins-protagonizes-yarns|newspaper=straight.com|date=Jul 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riley|first=Duncan|title=Protagonize Is A Good Read, Help Write "FriendFeed Fan"|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/572/protagonize-is-a-good-read-help-write-friendfeed-fan/|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=THE INQUISITR|date=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after launch, the site began to allow for linear narrative as well, and has since expanded to include poetry, screenplays, and other forms of literature.

Following its subsequent growth, there has been an increasing focus on the community aspect of the site, with features such as groups and writing circles being added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plus |url=http://www.protagonize.com/help/about |title=About Protagonize on Protagonize, a creative writing community |publisher=Protagonize.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008 Protagonize was selected as a finalist in the 2008 Canadian New Media Awards for "Excellence in Social Media Websites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Admin|title=Excellence in Social Media Websites|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/winners-at-the-canadian-new-media-awards-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009 Protagonize was one of seven local BC startups chosen to demo at Launch Party Vancouver 7 as part of the Startup Most Likely to Succeed competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Admin|title=Launch Part Vancouver 7 Companies Announced|url=http://blog.bootuplabs.com/2009/05/12/launch-party-vancouver-7-companies-announced/|publisher=Bootup Labs Blog|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Rob|title=Seven for LPV7 announced|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/seven-for-lpv7-announced|publisher=TECHVIBES|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one published book started out life as a story on Protagonize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heighway|first=Tricia|title=Paddytum|year=2010|publisher=Hirst Publishing|isbn=978-0956641731|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Paddytum-Tricia-Heighway/dp/0956641733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boog|first=Jason|title=Tricia Heighway: Digital Writer Spotlight|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/appnewser/tricia-heighway-digital-writer-spotlight_b1101|publisher=APP NEWSER|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2017, Protagonize closed down due to stagnant user growth and declining revenue from advertising and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bouton|first=Nick|title=The End of the Road|url=http://blog.protagonize.com/2017/05/04/the-end-of-the-road/|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4333">In [[mathematic]]s and [[political science]], the '''quota rule''' states that when proportionally [[Apportionment (politics)|apportioning seats]], the number of representative seats that should be alloted to a given party should be no more than the upper or lower roundings (called upper and lower quotas) of the [[proportional representation]];&lt;ref name="maa"&gt;https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/apportioning-representatives-in-the-united-states-congress-the-quota-rule Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt; i.e if a party deserves 10.56 seats out of 15, the quota rule states that when the seats are alloted, the party may get 10 or 11 seats, but not lower or higher. The use of this rule is important when allocating seats in places such as the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and any place that uses proportional representation.

==Mathematics==
The rule can be rigorously defined as follows: Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be the population of the party, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be the total population, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be the number of available seats. The quota for that party is then

: &lt;math&gt; \frac P T \cdot S&lt;/math&gt;

When the quota results in a fractional value, the lower quota is the quota rounded down and the upper quota is the quota rounded up. Hence, the quota rule states that the only allocation for that party should be either the lower or upper quota.&lt;ref name="maa"/&gt; If at any time an allocation gives a party a greater or lesser number of seats than the upper or lower quota, that allocation (and by extension, the method used to allocate it) is said to be in violation of the quota rule.

===Relation to other apportionment paradoxes===
The [[Apportionment_paradox#Balinski–Young_theorem|Balinski–Young theorem]] proved in 1980 that if an apportionment method satisfies the quota rule, it must fail to satisfy some other [[apportionment paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~bosikiew/Math11008/imposs-apportion.pdf Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, although [[Largest remainder method|Hamilton's method]] satisfies the quota rule, it violates the [[Alabama paradox]] and the [[population paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;https://rangevoting.org/Apportion.html Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem itself is broken up into several different proofs that cover a wide number of circumstances.&lt;ref name="Balinski"&gt;http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/1338/1/WP-80-131.pdf Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, there are two main statements that apply to the quota rule:
*Any method that follows the quota rule must fail the population paradox.&lt;ref name="Balinski"/&gt;
*Any method that is free of both the Alabama paradox and the population paradox must necessarily fail the quota rule for some circumstances.&lt;ref name="Balinski"/&gt;

==Use in apportionment methods==
Different methods for allocating seats may or may not satisfy the quota rule. For example, Hamilton's method proportions seats equally until a fractional value is reached; the surplus seats are then given to the state with the largest fractional parts until there are no more surplus seats. Hamilton's method will always pass the quota rule, as there is no period in which a state can be allotted more than the upper quota or less than the lower quota.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.math.colostate.edu/~freeman/m130/apportionment1.pdf Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jefferson's method]], which was one of the first used by the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;http://people.cas.uab.edu/~jcmayer/Apportionment%202.pdf
Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes allocated more than is allowed, violating the quota rule.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.math.colostate.edu/~spriggs/m130/apportionment2.pdf Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt; This violation led to a growing problem where larger states receive more representatives than smaller states, which was not corrected until [[Webster/Sainte-Laguë method|Webster's method]] was implemented in 1842; Webster's method also violates the quota rule, although much more rarely.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.vcu.edu/~gasmerom/MAT131/lecture4.html Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Road to Germany'''" is the third episode of the [[Family Guy (season 7)|seventh season]] and the fourth episode of the "[[Road to... (Family Guy)|Road To...]]" series of the American animated television series ''[[Family Guy]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 19, 2008.&lt;ref name=release&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Listings&amp;nbsp;— FAMILY GUY on FOX|publisher=The Futon Critic|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings.aspx?id=20080925fox20&amp;date=10/19/08|accessdate=2008-10-11|date=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, [[Mort Goldman|Mort]] accidentally goes into [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]'s time machine and is sent to [[Warsaw]], Poland on September 1, 1939. [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and Stewie realize Mort has gone back in time, and go in the time machine to save him. 

The episode was written by [[Patrick Meighan (writer)|Patrick Meighan]] and directed by Greg Colton. [[Brian Blessed]], [[Gregory Jbara]], [[Martin Savage (actor)|Martin Savage]], Jeff Witzke and Robert Boomfield guest star in the episode. "Road to Germany" was seen by approximately 9.07 million viewers during its original broadcast, and it received positive reviews from television critics. In 2009, the episode, along with "[[I Dream of Jesus]]" and "[[Family Gay]]", received an [[Emmy Award]] nomination for "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]".

==Plot==
While the neighbors are watching the [[Oscars]] at the Griffins' house, [[Mort Goldman|Mort]] needs to use the bathroom so desperately that he runs into what he thinks is a portable toilet in Stewie's room. The "toilet" turns out to be a time machine, and Mort is sent to the past. Realizing that Mort does not have a return pad that would be able to bring him back to the present, Stewie and Brian take one of the return pads and go back in time to save Mort. They end up in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] and find Mort in a [[Nożyk Synagogue|synagogue]]. He believes he is in [[Heaven]] as he sees dead family members there. It does not take long for them to realize that the date is September 1, 1939, the day of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[invasion of Poland]] and when [[World War II]] started.

The three cannot return to the present right away since the "return pad" to Stewie's time machine fails to activate.  They decide to go to [[England]] where Mort, who is Jewish, will be safe from the Nazis. While attempting to cross the border, German officers find out that Mort is Jewish (while doing a poor impersonation of a Catholic priest), resulting in their being chased by the Nazis.  Mort, Stewie and Brian make a getaway on a [[motorbike]], followed by an elaborate undersea pursuit in a hijacked [[U-boat]]. The chase scene on the motorbike re-enacts the skateboard chase scene in ''[[Back to the Future]]''.  Like Biff, the Nazi officers' car ends up slamming into a manure truck ("Das Poop!").  The three make it to England safely, and see [[Winston Churchill]]. Stewie examines the return pad and discovers it has run out uranium fuel.  Brian states that the only place they can find the needed uranium in this time is at a "secret" nuclear testing facility in [[Berlin]], [[Nazi Germany]]. The three join the [[Royal Air Force]] and fly a [[Lancaster bomber]] as they participate in a [[dogfight]] against a squadron of Luftwaffe [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters, eventually reaching Berlin. After finding the nuclear research lab, Stewie disguises himself as [[Adolf Hitler]], while the other two disguise themselves as Nazi Officers, and obtains the needed uranium. They then run into the real Hitler, who orders their execution, but they escape on the return pad back to their time (Hitler offered to spare them if they performed a charming musical number, but Mort cuts the eager Stewie and Brian off at the first line).

The group arrives back in Stewie's room 30 seconds before Mort originally entered the time machine. To keep these events from repeating themselves, Stewie kills the Mort that traveled with them by shoving him into the time machine and then blowing it up. The original Mort then enters the room and, now lacking the time machine "toilet" and seeing Stewie and Brian in Nazi uniform, [[Defecation|soils]] himself instead.

Furthermore, the U-boat crashing scene is a reference to the multiple police car chases (and subsequent crashes) from ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. The submarine scene also features a melody of 'Wishing Well' by [[Terrence Trent D'Arby]]. The scene where the Hawk Men defeat the Nazi Air Force is a parody of the film ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'', with its original soundtrack by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Stewie, Brian and Mort's escape from their crashing plane is a recreation of the raft scene from ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''. The Hebrew wedding scene plays a song titled "Through Poland to Jewish Village". The scene in the uranium lab where the scientist shows Stewie "one hundred Luftballons" followed by one popping is a reference to the song "[[99 Luftballons]]" where 99 red balloons trigger a nuclear war.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast in the United States on October 19, 2008, "Road to Germany" was watched by 9.07 million viewers and was the most watched show in Fox's [[Animation Domination]] block that night, beating ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[King of the Hill]]''.&lt;ref name="Ep3"&gt;{{cite news|author=Bill Gorman |title=Sunday: Desperate Housewives Tops Night, But Fox Animation Draws Youth |publisher=TV by the Numbers |date=October 20, 2008 |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2008/10/20/sunday-tv-ratings-desperate-housewives-tops-night-but-fox-animation-draws-youth/6506 |accessdate=September 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023083128/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2008/10/20/sunday-tv-ratings-desperate-housewives-tops-night-but-fox-animation-draws-youth/6506 |archivedate=October 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode acquired a 4.7 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] in the 18–49 demographic, finishing second in its timeslot after [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''.&lt;ref name="Ep3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The episode also acquired a 6.1 rating in the 18–34 demographic, finishing first in its timeslot.&lt;ref name="Ep3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

"Road to Germany" received positive reviews. Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] rated the episode 9.6 saying, "Featuring gorgeous CGI animation, a genuinely exciting storyline, and some hilariously offensive humor, this Stewie and Brian centric episode of Family Guy easily stands out as one of the best episodes of the show in years."&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; Alex Rocha of ''[[TV Guide]]'' was much more critical stating, "it seemed that the show has taken a slight fall back. After having great episodes the past few weeks to get this current season started on a roll, we have witnessed another average, even sub-par episode."&lt;ref name=tvguide/&gt; In his review of ''Family Guy'', volume 7, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called the episode "hugely memorable", and stated that it "features some of the finest animation the series has ever produced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/37739/family-guy-vol-7/|title=Family Guy, Vol. 7|work=DVD Talk|author=Rizzo, Francis III|date=June 16, 2009|accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Seth MacFarlane, "Road to Germany" was one of three episodes (Along with "[[I Dream of Jesus]]" and "[[Family Gay]]") submitted for consideration for "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]" in the [[61st Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2009.  "We picked three of our edgier shows as a choice," he explained,  "Ya know, we figured if we are going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are."  The series was ultimately nominated for the award, the first time in 48 years an animated series was nominated for the same category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = James | last = Hibberd | title = Family Guy smashes Emmy barrier for cartoons | publisher = Reuters | date = 2009-07-17 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE56G15O20090717 | accessdate = 2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Samut khoi''''' ({{lang-th|สมุดข่อย}}, {{IPA-th|sā.mùt kʰɔ̀j|pron}}; {{lang-lo|ສະໝຸດຂ່ອຍ}}; "''khoi'' books") or '''''samut thai''''' ({{lang-th|สมุดไทย|links=no}}, {{IPA-th|sā.mùt tʰāj|}}) are a type of folding-book [[manuscript]] which were historically widely used in many buddhist cultures, including [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Thailand]], as well as in [[Myanmar]], where they are known as ''[[parabaik]]''. The techniques used in their production came probably from the ancient kingdom of Ceylon (today's Sri Lanka). They are usually made with the paper of the [[Streblus asper|Siamese rough bush]] or ''khoi'' tree, and are not [[Bookbinding|bound]] like Western books but are folded in an accordion style. ''Samut khoi'' are made either with black paper (in Thailand known as ''samut thai dam''), or with white paper (''samut thai khao''). The use of ''samut khoi'' in Thailand dates to the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Paper|publisher=Nakorn Phanom National Library (Thailand)|url=http://www.finearts.go.th/nakhonphanomlibrary/parameters/km/item/ตำนานกระดาษ}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually used for secular texts including royal chronicles, legal documents and works of literature, while [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s were more commonly used for religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=สมุดข่อย และคัมภีร์ใบลาน กรุสมบัติจากบรรพชน|trans-title=''Samut khoi'' and palm-leaf manuscipts: treasure troves from our ancestors|url=http://www.ayutthayastudies.aru.ac.th/content/view/627/32/ |publisher=Ayutthaya Studies Institute, Ayutthaya Rajabhat University|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book: A Global History|chapter=Southeast Asia (2): The Mainland |first=Jana |last=Igunma |editor-first1=Michael F.|editor-last1=Suarez|editor-first2=H.

'''''Saudade''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˌ|s|aʊ|ˈ|d|ɑː|d|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;"[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/saudade Saudade]" in ''Oxford Dictionaries''. Oxford University Press. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-pt|sɐwˈðaðɨ|eu}}, {{IPA-pt|sawˈdadi|br}} or {{IPA-pt|sawˈdadʒi|}}, {{IPA-gl|sawˈðaðe|lang}}; plural '''''saudades''''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/default.aspx?pal=saudade|title=Significado / definição de saudade no Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa|author=Priberam Informática, S.A.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a deep emotional state of [[Nostalgia|nostalgic]] or profound [[Melancholia|melancholic]] longing for an absent something or someone that one loves. Moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never return.&lt;ref name="Bell, A.F. 1912 p. 402"&gt;Bell, A. F. (1912) ''In Portugal''. London and New York: The Bodley Head. Quoted in [[Shirlee Emmons|Emmons, Shirlee]] and Wilbur Watkins Lewis (2006) ''Researching the Song: A Lexicon.'' Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; One English translation of the word is '''missingness''', although it might not convey the feeling of deep emotion attached to the word "saudade".  Stronger forms of ''saudade'' might be felt towards people and things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as a lost lover, or a family member who has gone [[missing person|missing]], [[moving (address)|moved away]], separated, or died.

''Saudade'' was once described as "the love that remains" after someone is gone. ''Saudade'' is the recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events that once brought excitement, pleasure, well-being, which now triggers the senses and makes one live again. It can be described as an emptiness, like someone (e.g., one's children, parents, sibling, grandparents, friends, pets) or something (e.g., places, things one used to do in childhood, or other activities performed in the past) that should be there in a particular moment is missing, and the individual feels this absence. It brings sad and happy feelings together: sadness for missing and happiness for experiencing the past.

In Brazil, the day of ''Saudade'' is officially celebrated on 30 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/pwdtcomemorativas/default.php?reg=11&amp;p_secao=57|title=Portoweb - Datas Comemorativas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilescola.com/datacomemorativas/dia-da-saudade.htm|title=Dia da Saudade. Origem e curiosidades sobre o Dia da Saudade - Brasil Escola|work=Brasil Escola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Portuguese Empire.png|alt=|thumb|left|The distant lands of the [[Portuguese Empire]] made a special longing for the loved ones of explorers and sailors]]
The word ''saudade'' was used in the [[Cancioneiro da Ajuda]] (13th century), in the [[Cancioneiro da Vaticana]] and by poets of the time of King [[Denis of Portugal]]&lt;ref&gt;Basto, Cláudio. "Saudade em português e galego". ''Revista Lusitana'', Vol XVII, Livraria Clássica Editora, Lisboa 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; (reigned 1279–1325).
Some specialists say the word may have originated during the [[Portugal in the period of discoveries|Great Portuguese Discoveries]], giving meaning to the sadness felt about those who departed on journeys to unknown seas and disappeared in [[shipwreck]]s, died in battle, or simply never returned. Those who stayed behind—mostly women and children—suffered deeply in their absence. However, the Portuguese discoveries only started in 1415 and since the word has been found in earlier texts, this does not constitute a very good explanation. The [[Reconquista]] also offers a plausible explanation.

The state of mind has subsequently become a "Portuguese way of life": a constant feeling of absence, the sadness of something that's missing, wishful longing for completeness or wholeness and the yearning for the return of what is now gone, a desire for presence as opposed to absence—as it is said in Portuguese, a strong desire to ''matar as saudades'' (lit. ''to kill the saudades'').

In the latter half of the 20th century, ''saudade'' became associated with the longing for one's homeland, as hundreds of thousands of Portuguese-speaking people left in search of better futures in South America, North America, and Western Europe. Besides the implications derived from a wave of emigration trend from the motherland, historically speaking ''saudade'' is the term associated with the decline of Portugal's role in world politics and trade. During the so-called "Golden Age", synonymous with the era of discovery, Portugal  rose to the status of a [[world power]], and its monarchy became one of the richest in Europe. But with the competition from other European nations, the country went both colonially and economically into a prolonged period of decay. This period of decline and resignation from the world's cultural stage marked the rise of ''saudade'', aptly described by a sentence in Portugal's [[A Portuguesa|national anthem]]: ''Levantai hoje de novo o esplendor de Portugal'' (Lift up once again today the splendour of Portugal).

==Definition==
The ''[[Dicionário Houaiss da Língua Portuguesa]]'' defines ''saudade'' (or ''saudades'') as "A somewhat melancholic feeling of incompleteness. It is related to thinking back on situations of privation due to the absence of someone or something, to move away from a place or thing, or to the absence of a set of particular and desirable experiences and pleasures once lived."&lt;ref&gt;''Dicionário Houaiss da língua portuguese'' (Brazilian Portuguese Dictionary).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dictionary from the Royal Galician Academy, on the other hand, defines ''saudade'' as an "intimate feeling and mood caused by the longing for something absent that is being missed. This can take different aspects, from concrete realities (a loved one, a friend, the motherland, the homeland...) to the mysterious and transcendent. It is quite prevalent and characteristic of the galician-portuguese world, but it can also be found in other cultures."

===Related words===
Saudade is a word in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]] that claims [[Untranslatability|no direct translation]] in English. In Portuguese, "''Tenho saudades tuas''" (European Portuguese) or "''Estou com saudades de ti/você''" (Brazilian Portuguese), translates as "I have (feel) ''saudade'' of you" meaning "I miss you", but carries a much stronger tone. In fact, one can have ''saudade'' of someone whom one is with, but have some feeling of loss towards the past or the future. For example, one can  have "saudade" towards part of the relationship or emotions once experienced for/with someone, though the person in question is still part of one's life, as in "Tenho saudade do que fomos" (I feel "saudade" of the way we were). Another example can illustrate this use of the word saudade: "Que saudade!" indicating a general feeling of longing, whereby the object of longing can be a general and undefined entity/occasion/person/group/period etc. This feeling of longing can be accompanied or better described by an abstract will to be where the object of longing is.

Despite being hard to translate in full, ''saudade'' has equivalent words in other cultures, and is often related to music styles expressing this feeling such as the ''[[blues]]'' for African-Americans, ''[[Sehnsucht]]'' in German, ''[[wikt:dor#Romanian|dor]]'' in Romania, ''[[Tizita]]'' in Ethiopia, ''[[Hiraeth]]'' in Welsh, or ''Assouf'' for the [[Tuareg people]], appocundria in Neapolitan. In Slovak, the word is ''clivota'' or ''cnenie'', and in Czech, the word is ''stesk''. In Turkish, the word ''[[Hasret]]'' meaning longing, yearning or nostalgia has similar connotations.

The similar melancholic music style is known in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] as '''sevdah''' (ultimately from Arabic سَوْدَاء sawdā' : 'black [bile]', translation of the Greek µέλαινα χολή, mélaina cholē from which the term melancholy is derived).

==Elements==
[[File:Bertha Worms - Saudades de Nápoles, 1895.JPG|thumb|''Saudades de Nápoles'' (Missing Naples), 1895 by [[Bertha Worms]].]]

''Saudade'' is similar but not equal to [[nostalgia]], a word that also exists in Portuguese.

In the book ''In Portugal'' of 1912, A. F. G. Bell writes: {{quotation|The famous saudade of the Portuguese is a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist, for something other than the present, a turning towards the past or towards the future; not an active discontent or poignant sadness but an indolent dreaming wistfulness.&lt;ref name="Bell, A.F. 1912 p. 402"/&gt;}}

A stronger form of ''saudade'' may be felt towards people and things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as old ways and sayings; a lost lover who is sadly missed; a faraway place where one was raised; loved ones who have died; feelings and stimuli one used to have; and the faded, yet golden memories of youth. Although it relates to feelings of melancholy and fond memories of things/people/days gone by, it can be a rush of sadness coupled with a paradoxical joy derived from acceptance of fate and the hope of recovering or substituting what is lost by something that will either fill in the void or provide [[consolation]].

To F. D. Santos, ''Saudade'' as a noun has become a longing for longing itself: {{quotation|There was an evolution from saudades (plural) to Saudade (singular, preferably written with a capital S), which became a philosophical concept. ... Saudade has an object; however, its object has become itself, for it means 'nostalgia for nostalgia', a meta-nostalgia, a longing oriented toward the longing itself. It is no more the Loved One or the 'Return' that is desired, based on a sense of loss and absence. Now, Desire desires Desire itself, as in the poetry of ''love for love's sake'' in Arabic, or as in Lope de Vega's famous epigram about the Portuguese who was crying for his love for Love itself. Or, rather, as poetess Florbela Espanca put it, ''I long for the longings I don't have'' ('Anoitecer', Espanca 1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Santos|first1=Filipe D.|title=Education and the Boarding School Novel, The Work of José Régio|date=2017|publisher=Sense Publishers|location=Rotterdam|isbn=978-94-6300-739-9|page=102|url=https://books.google.pt/books?id=KqENDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Music===
As with all emotions, ''saudade'' has been an inspiration for many songs and compositions. "[[Sodade]]" (''saudade'' in [[Cape Verdean Creole]]) is the title of the [[Cape Verde]] singer [[Cesária Évora]]'s most famous song. [[Étienne Daho]], a French singer, also produced a song of the same name. ''[[The Good Son (album)|The Good Son]]'', a 1990 album by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]], was heavily informed by Cave's mental state at the time, which he has described as ''saudade''. He told journalist Chris Bohn: "When I explained to someone that what I wanted to write about was the memory of things that I thought were lost for me, I was told that the Portuguese word for this feeling was ''saudade''. It's not nostalgia but something sadder."

[[File:Cesária Évora 2008.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|upright=.79|Cape Verdean pop singer [[Cesária Évora]] had her biggest hit singing about ''saudade'']]
The usage of ''saudade'' as a theme in Portuguese music goes back to the 16th century, [[Portugal in the period of discoveries|the golden age of Portugal]]. ''Saudade'', as well as love suffering, is a common theme in many [[villancico]]s and [[cantiga]]s composed by Portuguese authors; for example: "Lágrimas de Saudade" (''tears of saudade''), which is an anonymous work from the ''[[Cancioneiro de Paris]]''. [[Fado]] is a Portuguese music style, generally sung by a single person (the ''fadista'') along with a [[Portuguese guitar]]. The most popular themes of fado are ''saudade'', nostalgia, jealousy, and short stories of the typical city quarters. [[Fado]] and ''saudade'' are intertwined key ideas in Portuguese culture. The word fado comes from Latin ''fatum'' meaning "fate" or "[[destiny]]". Fado is a musical cultural expression and recognition of this unassailable determinism which compels the resigned yearning of ''saudade'', a bitter-sweet, [[Existentialism|existential]] yearning and hopefulness towards something over which one has no control.

Spanish singer [[Julio Iglesias]], whose father is a [[Galician people|Galician]], speaks of ''saudade'' in his song "Un Canto a Galicia" (which roughly translates as "a song/chant for Galicia"). In the song, he passionately uses the phrase to describe a deep and sad longing for his motherland, Galicia. He also performs a song called "Morriñas", which describes the Galicians as having a deeply strong ''saudade''.

The Paraguayan guitarist [[Agustin Barrios]] wrote several pieces invoking the feeling of ''saudade'', including ''Choro de Saudade'' and ''Preludio Saudade''. The term is prominent in Brazilian popular music, including the first [[bossa nova]] song, "[[Chega de Saudade]]" ("No more ''saudade''", usually translated as "No More Blues"), written by [[Tom Jobim]].
Jazz pianist [[Bill Evans]] recorded the tune "Saudade de Brasil" numerous times. In 1919, on returning from two years in Brazil, the French composer [[Darius Milhaud]] composed a suite, ''[[Saudades do Brasil]]'', which exemplified the concept of ''saudade''. "Saudade (Part II)" is also the title of a flute solo by the band [[Shpongle]]. The singer [[Amália Rodrigues]] typified themes of ''saudade'' in some of her songs. J-Rock band [[Porno Graffitti]] has a song entitled "サウダージ", "Saudaaji" transliterated ("Saudade"). The alternative rock band [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love And Rockets]] has a song named "Saudade" on their album ''[[Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven]]''. June 2012 brought Bearcat's release of their self-titled indie album that included a song called "Saudade".

The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[jazz]]/Rock guitarist [[Jan Akkerman]] recorded a composition called "Saudade", the centerpiece of his 1996 album ''Focus in Time''. The Belgian electronic music band [[Arsenal_(Belgian_band)|Arsenal]] recorded a song called "Saudade" on their album ''Outsides'' (2005). The jazz fusion group [[Trio Beyond]], consisting of [[John Scofield]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], and [[Larry Goldings]] released in 2006 an album dedicated to drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] (1945–1997), called ''[[Saudades (Trio Beyond album)|Saudades]]''. Dance music artist Peter Corvaia released a progressive house track entitled "Saudade" on HeadRush Music, a sub-label of [[Toes in the Sand Recordings]]. New York City post-rock band [[Mice Parade]] released an album entitled ''[[Obrigado Saudade]]'' in 2004. [[Chris Rea]] also recorded a song entitled "Saudade Part 1 &amp; 2 (Tribute To Ayrton Senna)" as a tribute to [[Ayrton Senna]], the Brazilian three-times Formula One world champion killed on the track in May 1994. There is an ambient/noise/shoegazing band from Portland, Oregon, named Saudade. The rock band [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] has a Portuguese guitarist [[Nuno Bettencourt]]; the influence of his heritage can be seen in the band's album ''[[Saudades de Rock]]''. During recording, the mission statement was to bring back musicality to the medium. "Nancy Spain", a song by Barney Rush, made famous by an adaptation by [[Christy Moore]], is another example of the use of ''saudade'' in contemporary Irish music, the chorus of which is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"No matter where I wander I'm still haunted by your name&lt;br /&gt;
The portrait of your beauty stays the same&lt;br /&gt;
Standing by the ocean wondering where you've gone&lt;br /&gt;
If you'll return again&lt;br /&gt;
Where is the ring I gave to Nancy Spain?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

American singer/songwriter [[Grayson Hugh]] wrote a song called "Saudade" that he performed with jazz guitarist Norman Johnson on Johnson's 2013 album "Get It While You Can".

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] author [[Fernando Pessoa]]'s posthumous collection of writings ''[[The Book of Disquiet]]'' is written almost entirely in a tone of saudade, and deals with themes of nostalgia and alienation.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Australian author [[Suneeta Peres Da Costa]]'s novella ''Saudade'' follows Maria, a young girl from a Goan immigrant family, growing up in a political hierarchy of racism and colonialism&lt;ref&gt;Saudade, Peres Da Costa, Giramondo Publishing, March 2018 https://giramondopublishing.com/product/saudade/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
[[File:Localización de Galicia.svg|alt=|thumb|The Spanish region of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (red) lies north of Portugal and shares a cultural history of ''saudade''.]]
''Saudade'' is also associated with [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], where it is used similarly to the word ''morriña'' (longingness). Yet, morriña often implies a deeper stage of ''saudade'', a "''saudade'' so strong it can even kill," as the Galician saying goes. Morriña was a term often used by emigrant Galicians when talking about the Galician motherland they left behind. Although ''saudade'' is also a Galician word, the meaning of ''longing for something that might return'' is generally associated with ''morriña''. A literary example showing the understanding of the difference and the use of both words is the song ''Un canto a Galicia'' by [[Julio Iglesias]]. The word used by Galicians speaking Spanish has spread and become common in all Spain and even accepted by the [[Real Academia Española|Academia]].&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;''[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=morri%C3%B1a morriña]'' in the Spanish-language ''[[Diccionario de la Real Academia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Portugal, ''morrinha'' is a word to describe sprinkles, while ''morrinhar'' means "to sprinkle." (The most common Portuguese equivalents are ''chuvisco'' and ''chuviscar'', respectively.) ''Morrinha'' is also used in northern Portugal for referring to sick animals, for example of sheep [[dropsy]],&lt;ref name="DRAE"/&gt; and occasionally to sick or sad people, often with irony. It is also used in some Brazilian regional dialects for the smell of wet or sick animals.

In [[Goa]], [[India]], which was a Portuguese colony until 1961, some Portuguese influences still remain. A suburb of [[Margão]], Goa's largest city, has a street named Rua de Saudades. It was aptly named because that very street has the Christian cemetery, the Hindu ''[[shmashana]]'' (cremation ground) and the Muslim ''qabrastan'' (cemetery). Most people living in the city of Margão who pass by this street would agree that the name of the street could not be any other, as they often think fond memories of a friend, loved one, or relative whose remains went past that road. The word ''saudade'' takes on a slightly different form in Portuguese-speaking Goan families for whom it implies the once-cherished but never-to-return days of glory of Goa as a prized possession of Portugal, a notion since then made redundant by the irrevocable cultural changes that occurred with the end of the Portuguese regime in these parts.

In [[Cape Verdean Creole]] there is the word ''sodadi'' (also spelled ''sodade''), originated in the Portuguese ''saudade'' and exactly with the same meaning.

"'''Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious'''" is the thirteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on February 7, 1997.&lt;ref name=officialsite&gt;[http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-8_episode-13 "SimpsoncalifragilisticexpialaD'oh!cious"], ''The Simpsons.com''. Retrieved on March 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] becomes stressed, the Simpsons hire a nanny, a [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] parody, Shary Bobbins (voiced by [[Maggie Roswell]]).&lt;ref name="officialsite"/&gt; The episode was directed by [[Chuck Sheetz]] and written and executive produced by [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season8/page13.shtml Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious], ''BBC.co.uk''. Retrieved on March 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last episode for which Reiss received a writing credit. In 2014, Jean selected it as one of five essential episodes in the show's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2014/08/20/5-things-essential-simpsons-episodes/|title=5 Things: Essential Simpsons Episodes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
After discovering that she is losing hair at an alarming rate, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] visits [[Dr. Hibbert]], who informs her that [[Stress (biology)|stress]] is the cause. The Simpson family decides to hire a nanny who can help clean the house and take care of the children but have trouble finding the right one. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] sing a song about what they would consider as the perfect nanny and when a woman with an umbrella glides down from the sky and introduces herself as Shary Bobbins, she seems perfect and is hired. Shary proves helpful for the Simpson family. Marge recovers from her stress and her hair returns to normal. The next day, as the reformed Simpsons sit down to a perfect dinner, Shary declares her work finished but after leaving the house, she sees Homer strangling Bart as they are smashed through the living room window, Maggie attempting to put out a fire and Marge losing her hair again. With the family reverting to its previous state of [[dysfunctional family|dysfunction]], Shary is forced to stay. The family then treats her rudely and loses interest in her zest for life. Declaring that the Simpsons would be the death of her, she becomes [[clinical depression|depressed]] and starts to cry, sing, and drink. The family realizes what they have done and Marge admits to Shary that nothing can be done to change the Simpsons. Through song, they state that they are happy the way they are. Shary accepts this and leaves using her magical umbrella and although Homer suggests that they might see her again in the future, she is seen getting sucked into a jet engine in the background, unbeknownst to the family.

==Production==
Although the majority of the season eight episodes were [[executive producer|executive produced]] by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], former executive producers [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] had signed a deal with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] that allowed them to produce four episodes of ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for this episode originated several years before its airdate when Jean and Reiss were the regular showrunners. The idea was pitched at a writers' retreat by Jean but nobody had wanted to flesh it out. After being allowed to come back to produce some episodes, Jean and Reiss decided to write this episode.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; At first, Reiss was against the episode and felt that it was a bad idea.&lt;ref name="Reiss"&gt;{{cite video |people=Reiss, Mike |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that the plot was slightly ridiculous and that the show should not feature any magic; except for a few moments, he largely kept magic out of the episode. He now considers it one of the best episodes that he co-wrote.&lt;ref name="Reiss"/&gt;At the time, "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious" had more music in it than any other episode.&lt;ref name="Sheetz"&gt;{{cite video |people=Sheetz, Chuck |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode        Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; While writing, Jean thought that the songs would stretch out and make the episode the proper length but it was considerably shorter than required.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; Several additional scenes, such as the ''[[Itchy &amp; Scratchy]]'' segment, were added to pad out the episode.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; There was originally a sequence where Bart, Lisa and Shary visit [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Patty and Selma]] who sing "We Love to Smoke", a parody of "[[I Love to Laugh]]".&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; The song was cut because it wasn't getting any laughs but the full version was included on the album ''[[Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons]]'' and a brief animated version was included as a deleted scene on the Season 8 [[DVD]].&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; During the end song, Homer can be seen dancing along but not singing; this was because the producers forgot to record [[Dan Castellaneta]].&lt;ref name="Reiss"/&gt; Many of the scenes were animated by [[Eric Stefani]], a former member of [[No Doubt]], who specialized in animation for musical numbers.&lt;ref name="Sheetz"/&gt;

===Casting===
[[Julie Andrews]] (who portrayed the titular role in ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'') was originally slated to appear in the episode as Shary, but in the end, the producers went with series regular [[Maggie Roswell]] after hearing Roswell's reading for the part.&lt;ref name="Reiss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartwright"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cartwright |first=Nancy |title=My Life as a Ten Year old Boy |isbn=0-7868-6696-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quentin Tarantino]] was also asked to guest star, but he did not want to deliver the lines required, believing them to be insulting.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; Instead, regular Dan Castellaneta did the voice.&lt;ref name="Groening"&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The plot of the episode is a reference to the 1964 film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''; Shary Bobbins is [[wiktionary:expy|based on the character]] [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] and the episode title is a spoof of the word "[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]". Several of the musical numbers are also direct parodies of songs from the film, including "[[The Perfect Nanny]]", "[[The Life I Lead]]", "[[A Spoonful of Sugar]]" and "[[Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)|Feed the Birds]]"; a deleted scene featured [[Patty and Selma]] singing their version of "[[I Love to Laugh]]".&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt;

The montage of Marge losing her hair features the song "[[Hair (Hair song)|Hair]]" from the musical ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]'' (though the version heard is [[The Cowsills]] version).&lt;ref name="Silverman"&gt;{{cite video |people=Silverman, David |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homer says he has seen ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' and believes that some of the candidates for the role of nanny are men in drag.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; Homer's imagination is a parody of the dancing characters in ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' and features the song "[[Turkey in the Straw]]".&lt;ref name="Silverman"/&gt; In the park, [[Groundskeeper Willie]] is seen singing a cover version of "[[Maniac (Michael Sembello song)|Maniac]]" by [[Michael Sembello]]. The scene where Principal Skinner attempts to sell Jimbo is a reference to a similar scene in the story ''[[Oliver Twist]]''.

The ''[[The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show|Itchy &amp; Scratchy]]'' short "Reservoir Cats" is a parody of the scene in ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' where Mr. Blonde cuts off the ear of the police officer. The sequence features the same setting, camera angles and music &amp;mdash; "[[Stuck in the Middle With You]]" by [[Stealers Wheel]]. At the end, Itchy and Scratchy dance in a manner similar to that seen in the film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; Shary and [[Barney Gumble]] sing a drunken rendition of [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s "[[Margaritaville]]".&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt;

'''''The People That Time Forgot''''' is a 1977 [[Technicolor]] [[fantasy]]/[[adventure film]] based on the novel ''[[The People That Time Forgot (novel)|The People That Time Forgot]]'' (1924) and ''[[Out of Time's Abyss]]'' (1924) by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]. It was produced by Britain's [[Amicus Productions]] and directed by [[Kevin Connor (director)|Kevin Connor]]. Like Connor's other two Burroughs-derived films, ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (1975 film)|The Land That Time Forgot]]'' and ''[[At the Earth's Core (film)|At the Earth's Core]]'', the film was distributed in the United States by [[American International Pictures]]. 

The film is a direct sequel to ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (1975 film)|The Land That Time Forgot]]'', which initiated the series in 1975. The story follows a rescue expedition, led by [[Patrick Wayne]] in search of his friend, played by [[Doug McClure]], who had vanished many years before. The expedition lands on [[Caprona (island)|Caprona]], the same fantastic [[prehistoric]] land where [[dinosaur]]s and [[barbarian]] tribes of men coexist.

==Plot==
Major Ben McBride ([[Patrick Wayne]]) organises a mission to the Antarctic wastes to search for his friend Bowen Tyler ([[Doug McClure]]) who has been missing in the region for several years. A British naval survey ship takes them to Caprona. McBride's party: the [[paleontology|paleontologist]] Norfolk ([[Thorley Walters]]), gunner and mechanic Hogan ([[Shane Rimmer]]) and photographer Lady Charlotte 'Charlie' Cunningham ([[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]]) fly over the mountain wall of Caprona in an amphibious aircraft, but are attacked by a [[pterodactyl]] and forced down.

They find themselves in a world populated by primitive warriors and terrifying prehistoric creatures, all of whom they must evade in order to get back safely to their ship. They meet a cave-girl, Ajor ([[Dana Gillespie]]), who can speak English (she was taught by Tyler); she leads them to the land of a race of [[samurai]]-like warriors called the Nargas, who are keeping Tyler prisoner. When the volcano that the Nargas worship erupts, they must escape the cataclysm engulfing the land. Tyler sacrifices himself to cover their retreat.

According to Kevin Connor, Amicus Productions wanted to follow ''At the Earth's Core'' with an adaptation of the [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] stories but could not afford the rights so they made this sequel instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickfeast.co.uk/spotlight/interview-kevin-connor/|title=An Interview with Kevin Connor |website=Flickfeast|date=10 Ausut 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the film was made by Amicus Productions, the company folded before it was released meaning [[American International Pictures|AIP]] took sole credit.&lt;ref name="amicus"&gt;Ed. Allan Bryce, ''Amicus: The Studio That Dripped Blood'', Stray Cat Publishing, 2000 p 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes==
The film makes some notable changes from the book:
* The lost world is a "polar continent" rather than the interior of a polar island.
* Bowen dies in the film and Lisa (Lys in the novels) is already dead during the events of the film while they both survive in the novel.
* In the book, the ship's crew scale the mountains to come to the rescue.
* The book ends with two marriages; the film, none.

==Creatures==
* ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''
* ''[[Stegosaurus]]''
* ''[[Scutosaurus]]''
* ''[[Megalania]]''
* ''[[Pterodactylus]]''

==Critical reception==
''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' thought the film "A lame sequel to Connor's earlier Edgar Rice Burroughs adaptation, The Land That Time Forgot, which was at least occasionally lively";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/people_that_time_forgot/reviews/|title=The People That Time Forgot - Movie Reviews - Rotten Tomatoes|website=www.rottentomatoes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Radio Times]]'' called it an "OK sequel," but a "constipated confection" with "ludicrous mechanised dinosaurs and hopeless acting from an interesting cast." The reviewer however, found that "A few shots, composed around celebrated fantasy illustrations, compensate for all the film's shortcomings";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/wjnr/the-people-that-time-forgot/|title=The People That Time Forgot – review - cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and critic Derek Winnert similarly opined "the monsters and special effects are below par," but "there are effective moments, and there is some curiosity value in seeing singer Dana Gillespie playing Ajor";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.derekwinnert.com/the-people-that-time-forgot-1977-doug-mcclure-patrick-wayne-sarah-douglas-classic-movie-review-6223/|title=The People that Time Forgot ** (1977, Doug McClure, Patrick Wayne, Sarah Douglas) – Classic Movie Review 6223 - Derek Winnert|website=www.derekwinnert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Blu-ray.com'' thought the film "may not be the most polished effort around, but there's fun to be had with its crazy dino encounters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-People-That-Time-Forgot-Blu-ray/126466/#Review|title=The People That Time Forgot Blu-ray|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TheStoryOfArt.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''The Story of Art''''', by [[Ernst Gombrich|E. H. Gombrich]], is a survey of the [[art history|history of art]] from ancient times to the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Gombrich|E. H. Gombrich]] (2006), ''The Story of Art'', London: [[Phaidon Press]], 978-0-7148-324-70&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1950 by [[Phaidon Press|Phaidon]], the book is widely regarded both as a seminal work of criticism and as one of the most accessible introductions to the [[visual arts]]. It was originally intended for younger readers. Over seven million copies have been sold, making it the best selling art book of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/17/story-of-art-eh-gombrich Picture perfect.] William Skidelsky, ''[[The Observer]]'', 17 May 2009. theguardian.com Retrieved 5 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in its 16th edition and has been translated into approximately 30 languages.

==Summary==
The book is divided into an introduction, 27 chapters each dealing with a defined time period of art history within one or several cultural/geographic contexts, and a concluding chapter summarizing the latest developments in visual arts. The first chapter starts examining [[prehistoric art]] and native cultures. The next four chapters are dedicated to the greater ancient cultures, especially Greece and Rome. Starting with chapter 8, Gombrich then begins to focus on Central European art, returning to a more global view in chapter 24 that deals with art of the late 18th and early 19th century in England, France and America. A striking property of ''The Story of Art'' is the amount of illustrations it contains, with more than 50% of the book's pages devoted to color photographs of paintings, drawings, architecture and sculptures. In the preface, Gombrich explains that it has been his intention not to mention any work of art that he could not also include as an illustration.

The first two sentences of the book have become famous: ″There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=E. H.|title=The Story of Art|date=1984|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-850066-5|page=4|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gombrich later elaborated on this statement by saying that he defines "art" based on its Latin root, meaning "skill," and that there is "no disembodied skill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrier|first1=David|title=Gombrich and Danto on Defining Art|journal=The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1996|volume=54|issue=3|page=279|jstor=431629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of technology attempt to explain the factors that shape technological innovation as well as the impact of technology on society and culture. Most contemporary theories of technology reject two previous views: the [[Linear model of innovation|linear model of technological innovation]] and [[technological determinism]]. To challenge the linear model, today's theories of technology point to the historical evidence that technological innovation often gives rise to new scientific fields, and emphasizes the important role that social networks and cultural values play in shaping technological artifacts. To challenge technological determinism, today's theories of technology emphasize the scope of technical choice, which is greater than most laypeople realize; as science and technology scholars like to say, "It could have been different." For this reason, theorists who take these positions typically argue for greater public involvement in technological decision-making.

== Social theories ==
'Social' theories focus on how humans and technology affect each other. Some theories focus on how decisions are made with humans and technology: humans and technology are equal in the decision, humans drive technology, and vice versa. The interactions used in a majority of the theories on this page look at individual human's interactions with technology, but there is a sub-group for a group of people interacting with technology. The theories described are purposefully vague and ambiguous, since the circumstances for the theories change as human culture and technology innovations change.

=== Descriptive approaches ===

* [[Social construction of technology]] (SCOT) – argues that technology does not determine human action, but that human action shapes technology. Key concepts include:
** '''interpretive flexibility''': "Technological artifacts are culturally constructed and interpreted ... By this we mean not only that there is flexibility in how people think of or interpret artifacts but also that there is flexibility in how artifacts are designed." 
** '''Relevant social group''': shares a particular set of meanings about an artifact
** ''''''Closure''' and stabilization''': when the relevant social group has reached a consensus 
** '''Wider context:''' "the sociocultural and political situation of a social group shapes its norms and values, which in turn influence the meaning given to an artifact" 
: Key authors include MacKenzie and Wajcman (1985).

* [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT) –  posits a heterogeneous network of humans and non-humans as equal interrelated actors. It strives for impartiality in the description of human and nonhuman actors and the reintegration of the natural and social worlds. For example, Latour (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (1992). Where are the missing masses? The sociology of a few mundane artifacts. In Bijker, W. and Law, J., editors, Shaping Technology/Building Society. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA&lt;/ref&gt; argues that instead of worrying whether we are anthropomorphizing technology, we should embrace it as inherently anthropomorphic: technology is made by humans, substitutes for the actions of humans, and shapes human action. What is important is the chain and gradients of actors' actions and competences, and the degree to which we choose to have figurative representations. Key concepts include the '''inscription''' of beliefs, practices, relations into technology, which is then said to '''embody''' them. Key authors include [[Bruno Latour|Latour]] (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (1997). On Actor Network Theory: a few clarifications&lt;/ref&gt; and Callon (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Callon, M. (1999). Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of Saint Brieuc Bay. In Biagioli, M., editor, The Science Studies Reader, pages 67–83. Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*[[Structuration theory]] – defines structures as rules and resources organized as properties of social systems. The theory employs a recursive notion of actions constrained and enabled by structures which are produced and reproduced by that action. Consequently, in this theory technology is not rendered as an artifact, but instead examines how people, as they interact with a technology in their ongoing practices,enact structures which shape their emergent and situated use of that technology. Key authors include DeSanctis and Poole (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Desanctis, G. and Poole, M. S. (1994). Capturing the complexity in advanced technology use: adaptive structuration theory. Organization Science, 5(2):121-147&lt;/ref&gt;, and Orlikowski (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Orlikowski, W.J. (1992). The duality of technology: rethinking the concept of technology in organizations. Organization Science, 3(3):398-427.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Systems theory]] – considers the historical development of technology and media with an emphasis on inertia and heterogeneity, stressing the connections between the artifact being built and the social, economic, political and cultural factors surrounding it. Key concepts include [[reverse salient]]s when elements of a system lag in development with respect to others, differentiation, [[operational closure]], and [[autopoietic autonomy]]. Key authors include [[Thomas P. Hughes]] (1992) and [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]] (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. (2000). The reality of the mass media. Stanford, Stanford, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Activity theory]] - considers an entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations, etc.) beyond just one actor or user. It accounts for environment, history of the person, culture, role of the artifact, motivations, and complexity of real life activity. One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality—it studies both through the mediating activity. The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object-oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or activity system.

=== Critical approaches ===

[[Critical theory]] goes beyond a descriptive account of how things are, to examine why they have come to be that way, and how they might otherwise be. Critical theory asks whose interests are being served by the [[status quo]] and assesses the potential of future alternatives to better serve social justice. According to Geuss's&lt;ref&gt;Geuss, R. (1981) The Idea of a Critical Theory, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; definition, "a critical theory, then, is a reflective theory which gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment and emancipation' (1964). Marcuse argued that whilst matters of technology design are often presented as neutral technical choices in fact they manifest political or moral values. Critical theory is a form of archaeology that attempt to get beneath common-sense understandings in order to  reveal the power relationships and interests determining particular technological configuration and use. 
 
Perhaps the most developed contemporary critical theory of technology is contained in the works of [[Andrew Feenberg]] including 'Transforming Technology' (2002).

* Values in Design - asks how do we ensure a place for values (alongside technical standards such as speed, efficiency, and reliability) as criteria by which we judge the quality and acceptability of information systems and new media. How do values such as privacy, autonomy, democracy, and social justice become integral to conception, design, and development, not merely retrofitted after completion? Key thinkers include [[Helen Nissenbaum]] (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Nissenbaum, H. (2001). How computer systems embody values. Computer, 34(3):120-118.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Group Theories ===
There are also a number of technology related theories that address how (media) technology affects group processes. Broadly, these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media. Some (e.g., media richness) are concerned with questions of media choice (i.e., when to use what medium effectively). Other theories (social presence, SIDE, media naturalness) are concerned with the consequences of those media choices (i.e., what are the social effects of using particular communication media).

* [[Social presence theory]] (Short, et al., 1976&lt;ref&gt;Short, J. A., Williams, E., and Christie, B. (1976). The social psychology of telecommunications. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a seminal theory of the social effects of communication technology. Its main concern is with telephony and telephone conferencing (the research was sponsored by the British Post Office, now British Telecom). It argues that the social impact of a communication medium depend on the ''social presence'' it allows communicators to have. Social presence is defined as a property of the medium itself: the degree of acoustic, visual, and physical contact that it allows. The theory assumes that more contact will increase the key components of "presence": greater intimacy, immediacy, warmth and inter-personal rapport. As a consequence of social presence, social influence is expected to increase. In the case of communication technology, the assumption is that more text-based forms of interaction (e-mail, instant messaging) are less social, and therefore less conducive to social influence.
* [[Media richness theory]] (Daft &amp; Lengel, 1986)&lt;ref&gt;Daft, R. L. and Lengel, R. H. (1986). Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design. Management Science, 32(5):554-571&lt;/ref&gt; shares some characteristics with social presence theory. It posits that the amount of information communicated differs with respect to a medium's ''richness''. The theory assumes that resolving ambiguity and reducing uncertainty are the main goals of communication. Because communication media differ in the rate of understanding they can achieve in a specific time (with "rich" media carrying more information), they are not all capable of resolving uncertainty and ambiguity well. The more restricted the medium's capacity, the less uncertainty and equivocality it is able to manage. It follows that the richness of the media should be matched to the task so as to prevent over simplification or complication.
* [[Media naturalness theory]] (Kock, 2001; 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Kock, N. (2001). The ape that used email: Understanding e-communication behavior through evolution theory. Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 5(3), 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kock, N. (2004). The psychobiological model: Towards a new theory of computer-mediated communication based on Darwinian evolution. Organization Science, 15(3), 327-348.&lt;/ref&gt; builds on human evolution ideas and has been proposed as an alternative to media richness theory. Media naturalness theory argues that since our Stone Age hominid ancestors have communicated primarily face-to-face, evolutionary pressures have led to the development of a brain that is consequently designed for that form of communication. Other forms of communication are too recent and unlikely to have posed evolutionary pressures that could have shaped our brain in their direction. Using communication media that suppress key elements found in face-to-face communication, as many electronic communication media do, thus ends up posing cognitive obstacles to communication. This is particularly the case in the context of complex tasks (e.g., business process redesign, new product development, online learning), because such tasks seem to require more intense communication over extended periods of time than simple tasks.
* Media synchronicity theory (MST, Dennis &amp; Valacich, 1999) redirects richness theory towards the ''synchronicity'' of the communication.
* The [[social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE)]] (Postmes, Spears and Lea 1999&lt;ref&gt;Postmes, T., Spears, R., and Lea, M. (1999). Social identity, group norms, and deindividuation: Lessons from computer-mediated communication for social influence in the group. In N. Ellemers, R. Spears, B. D., editor, Social Identity: Context, Commitment, Content. Blackwell., Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;; Reicher, Spears and Postmes, 1995&lt;ref&gt;Reicher, S., Spears, R., &amp; Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. In W. Stroebe &amp; M. Hewstone (Eds.), European Review of Social Psychology (Vol. 6, pp. 161–198). Chichester: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;;Spears &amp; Lea, 1994 &lt;ref&gt;Spears, R., &amp; Lea, M. (1994). Panacea or panopticon? The hidden power in computer-mediated communication. Communication Research, 21, 427-459.&lt;/ref&gt;) was developed as a response to the idea that anonymity and reduced presence made communication technology socially impoverished (or "deindividuated"). It provided an alternative explanation for these "[[deindividuation]] effects" based on theories of social identity (e.g., Turner et al., 1987&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S., &amp; Wetherell, M. S. (1987). Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory. Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;). The SIDE model distinguishes cognitive and strategic effects of a communication technology. Cognitive effects occur when communication technologies make "salient" particular aspects of personal or social identity. For example, certain technologies such as email may disguise characteristics of the sender that individually differentiate them (i.e., that convey aspects of their personal identity) and as a result more attention may be given to their social identity. The strategic effects are due to the possibilities, afforded by communication technology, to selectively communicate or enact particular aspects of identity, and disguise others. SIDE therefore sees the social and the technological as mutually determining, and the behavior associated with particular communication forms as the product or interaction of the two.
* Time, interaction, and performance (TIP; McGrath, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, J.E. (1991). Time, interaction, and performance (tip): A theory of groups. small group research. 22(2):147-174.&lt;/ref&gt; theory describes work groups as time-based, multi-modal, and multi-functional social systems. Groups interact in one of the modes of inception, problem solving, conflict resolution, and execution. The three functions of a group are production (towards a goal), support (affective) and well-being (norms and roles).

=== Other Stances ===
Additionally, many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories. For example, [[Steve Woolgar]] (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, S. (1991). The turn to technology in social studies of science. Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 16(1):20-50.&lt;/ref&gt; considers ''technology as text'' in order to critique the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion: the instrumental response (interpretive flexibility), the interpretivist response (environmental/organizational influences), the reflexive response (a double hermeneutic). Pfaffenberger (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Pfaffenberger, B. (1992). Technological dramas. Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 17(3):282-312.&lt;/ref&gt; treats ''technology as drama'' to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power. A technological drama is a discourse of technological "statements" and "counterstatements" within the processes of technological regularization, adjustment, and reconstitution.

An important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by [[Bernard Stiegler]]&lt;ref&gt;Stiegler, B. (1998). Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including [[Gilbert Simondon]] and [[André Leroi-Gourhan]].
In the Schumpeterian and Neo-Schumpeterian theories technologies are critical factors of [[economic growth]] ([[Carlota Perez]])&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Carlota (2009).Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms. Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20. (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn)&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Analytic theories ==

Finally, there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent, but are used by authors in describing existing literature, in contrast to their own or as a review of the field.

For example, Markus and Robey (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Markus, M. and Robey, D. (1988). Information technology and organizational change: causal structure in theory and research. Management Science, 34:583-598.&lt;/ref&gt; propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency (technological, organizational, imperative, emergent), its structure (variance, process), and the level (micro, macro) of analysis.

Orlikowski (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Orlikowski, W.J. (1992). The duality of technology: rethinking the concept of technology in organizations. Organization Science, 3(3):398-427.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope (is technology more than hardware?) and role (is it an external objective force, the interpreted human action, or an impact moderated by humans?) and identifies three models:
# '''Technological imperative:''' focuses on organizational characteristics which can be measured and permits some level of contingency
# '''Strategic choice:''' focuses on how technology is influenced by the context and strategies of decision-makers and users
# '''Technology as a trigger of structural change:''' views technology as a social object

[[Gerardine DeSanctis|DeSanctis]] and Poole (1994) similarly write of three views of technology's effects: 
# '''Decision-making:''' the view of engineers associated with positivist, rational, systems rationalization, and deterministic approaches
# '''Institutional school:''' technology is an opportunity for change, focuses on social evolution, social construction of meaning, interaction and historical processes, interpretive flexibility, and an interplay between technology and power
# '''An integrated perspective (social technology):''' soft-line determinism, with joint social and technological optimization, structural symbolic interaction theory

Bimber (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Bimber, B. (1998). Three faces of technological determinism. In Smith, M. and Marx, L., editors, Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism, pages 79–100. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; addresses the determinacy of technology effects by distinguishing between the:
# '''Normative:''' an autonomous approach where technology is an important influence on history only where societies attached cultural and political meaning to it (e.g., the industrialization of society)
# '''Nomological:''' a naturalistic approach wherein an inevitable technological order arises based on laws of nature (e.g., steam mill had to follow the hand mill). 
# '''''[[Unintended consequence]]s:''''' a fuzzy approach that is demonstrative that technology is contingent (e.g., a car is faster than a horse, but unbeknownst to its original creators become a significant source of pollution)

'''Women to the Top''' ('''W2T''') was a European project for bringing more women into top management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/lika-villkor-pa-jobbet-viktigt/|title=Lika villkor på jobbet viktigt|last=Björklund|first=Marianne|date=2004-11-08|work=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded by the [[European Commission]] and ran 2003-2005 in Estonia, Denmark, Greece and Sweden,&lt;ref name="aboutus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w2t.se/uk/about.htm|title=Women to the Top|publisher=Women to the Top (W2T) |accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in a transnational conference in Stockholm, 24–25 January 2005.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt; The total budget was 5.6 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]] (half a million euros). The project was directed toward private and public employers.&lt;ref name="svd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/nyheter/artikel_1043415.svd|title=Gemensamt krafttag för ett mer jämställt Europa|last=Danielsson|first=Anna|date=2005-01-25|work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report of Women to the Top, and a summary of the final report, are available online&lt;ref name=FinalReport&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trollvik|first1=Marie|title=Women to the Top (Final Report)|url=http://www.femtech.at/fileadmin/downloads/Wissen/Themen/Gleichstellung_in_Unternehmen/Women_to_the_top.pdf|publisher=FEMtech - Frauen in Forschung und Technologie|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FinalReportSummary&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report - Women to the Top (Summary)|url=http://www.w2t.se/uk/facts/final_report.htm|publisher=Women to the Top|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an article was published discussing the results:  {{cite journal|last=Eriksson-Zetterquist|first=Ulla|author2=Styhre, Alexander |year=2007|title=Overcoming the Glass Barriers: Reflection and Action in the 'Women to the Top' Programme|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|volume=15|issue=2|pages=133–160|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2007.00366.x}}

== Estonia ==
In Estonia, Tiina Raitviir surveyed female executives from Estonia’s Top500 companies.  One hundred women managers were identified as the basis for an informal network and a mentorship program.  Eighty women managers participated in an initial seminar. Nine women followed up in subsequent workshops.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt; All of the companies were foreign owned because it was believed they would be more willing to participate in the project than Estonian companies.&lt;ref name="svd" /&gt;

== Denmark ==
Fifty-one potential top managers attended interdisciplinary networks hosted by CeLi and two trade unions, the Danish Society of Engineers (IDA) and the Danish Association of Lawyers and Economists (DJØF). These women formed professional networks for Women in Top Management, Women in Human Resource Management and Women in Project Management.  They attended seminars and a national conference.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt; In addition, four recruitment firms were involved in a focus group to develop gender recommendations for consultants and managers.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt;

== Greece ==
In Greece, the project worked with The Research Centre for Gender Equality (KETHI). Thirty women attended counselling on entrepreneurship for women who wanted to start their own businesses. Seven more women attended vocational workshops at the organisations Amel, Elgeka and the Municipality of Athens. Members from ten recruitment companies took part in seminars and research on gender inequality and leadership. A survey was carried out to learn more about gender and employment.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt;

== Sweden ==
In Sweden the project was administered by the [[Swedish Ombudsman for Equal Opportunities|Ombudsman for Equal Opportunities]] (Jämo)&lt;ref name="NIKK"&gt;{{Cite news
