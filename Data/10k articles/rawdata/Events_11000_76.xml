The '''Morecambe Bay cockling disaster''' ({{zh|拾貝慘案}} ''Shi bèi cǎn'àn'', "cockle-picking tragedy") occurred on the evening of 5&amp;nbsp;February 2004 at [[Morecambe Bay]] in [[North West England]], when at least 21 Chinese illegal immigrant labourers were drowned by an incoming [[tide]] after picking [[Common cockle|cockles]] off the [[Lancashire]]/[[Cumbria]]n coast.&lt;ref name=bbc-20060324&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4582470.stm#map |title=Death in a cold, strange land |author=Joe Boyle |publisher=BBC |date=24 March 2006 |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
David Anthony Eden, Sr., and David Anthony Eden, Jr., a father-and-son team from England, had unlawfully hired a group of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] workers to pick cockles; they were to be paid [[pound sterling|£]]5 per 25&amp;nbsp;kg of cockles, (9p per [[pound (mass)|lb]]), far less than the typical local rate at the time.&lt;ref name="thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/640835.cockles_pickers_were_swimming_the_wrong_direction/ |title=Cockle pickers were swimming the wrong direction |newspaper=Westmorland Gazette |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese had been imported unlawfully via containers into Liverpool, and were hired out through local criminal agents of international Chinese [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]]s. The cockles to be collected are best found at low tide on sand flats at Warton Sands, near [[Hest Bank]]. The Chinese workers were unfamiliar with local geography, language, and custom. They were cut off by the incoming tide in the bay around 9:30 pm.

The emergency services were alerted by a mobile phone call made by one of the workers, who spoke little English and was only able to say "sinking water" before the call was cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/4364586.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cockle jury played distress call | date=21 October 2005 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4582470.stm|work=BBC News|title=Death in a cold, strange land|date=24 March 2006|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 21 bodies, of men and women between the ages of 18 and 45, were recovered from the bay after the incident.

At the subsequent hearing,  British cocklers returning to shore on the same evening were reported to have attempted to warn the Chinese group by tapping their watches and trying to speak with them.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt; A survivor testified that the leader of the group had made a mistake about the time of the tides.&lt;ref name="thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk" /&gt; Fourteen other members of the group are reported to have made it safely to the shore, making 15 survivors in total. The workers were all [[illegal immigrant]]s, mainly from the [[Fujian]] province of China, and have been described as being untrained and inexperienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Victims of the sands and the snakeheads|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/07/china.immigration1|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Anthony Eden, Sr., and David Anthony Eden, Jr., from [[Prenton]] in [[Merseyside]], who bought cockles from the work gang, were cleared of helping the workers break immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2006/c06005.htm Cocklers tragedy highlights need for high safety standards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020142609/http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2006/c06005.htm |date=20 October 2010 }} [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] press release, 24 March 2006, accessed 19 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Gangmaster Lin Liang Ren was found guilty of the manslaughter of at least 21 people (two further cocklers were thought to have been killed, but their bodies were never found).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/4832454.stm|title=Man guilty of 21 cockling deaths|date=2006-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ren, his girlfriend Zhao Xiao Qing and his cousin Lin Mu Yong were also convicted of breaking immigration laws. Ren was sentenced to 12 years for manslaughter, 6 years for facilitating illegal immigration (to be served concurrently with the manslaughter sentence), and 2 years for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice (to be served subsequent to the manslaughter sentence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/4851194.stm|title=Cockler gangmaster gets 14 years|date=2006-03-28|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lin Mu Yong was sentenced to four years and nine months. Zhao Xiao Qing was sentenced to 2 years and 9 months for facilitation of illegal immigration and perverting the course of justice.

==Media==
The 2006 film ''[[Ghosts (2006 film)|Ghosts]]'', directed by [[Nick Broomfield]], is a dramatisation of the events leading up to the tragedy.

In 2013, artist [[Isaac Julien]] released his film ''[[Ten Thousand Waves]]'' about the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-24915036|title=From Morecambe to MoMA: New York showing for Ten Thousand Waves|date=25 November 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013|author=Simon Armstrong|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 folk song "On Morecambe Bay" by folk artist Kevin Littlewood tells the story of these tragic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancasterguardian.co.uk/what-s-on/bay-tragedy-is-set-in-song-1-1170659|title=Bay tragedy is set in song|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This song was later covered by folk musician [[Christy Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shirazsocialist.wordpress.com/2012/02/11/on-morecambe-bay/|title=On Morecambe Bay|work=Shiraz Socialist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 spoken-word track by [[Momus (musician)|Momus]], "Cockle Pickers", relates the story of the tragedy.

In 2017, British Band [[Stereo Honey]] released "The Bay" as a part of their "Monuments" EP, which is about the 2004 tragedy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/Stereo-honey-the-bay-lyrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''22 June 1897''''' is a 1979 [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film, co-written by [[Shankar Nag]] and Nachiket Patwardhan and directed by the husband and wife team of Jayoo Patwardhan and Nachiket Patwardhan. The duo are also practising architects. It is based on the true life story of the assassination of British Government officers Rand ICS and Lt. Ayerst.
The film has been included in the book ''One Hundred Indian Feature Films: An Annotated Filmography'', a representative selection from the first Indian talkies to the then-present date (1988). The title of the film is the date of the assassination, 22 June 1897. It won the 1980 Indian [[National Film Awards|Silver Lotus]] at the [[National Film Awards]] in two categories: Best film on National Integration and Art Direction. It also won the 1980 [[Maharashtra State Film Awards|Maharashtra State awards]] for best film of the year and best director. The film has been included in the selected collection of Indian films and videos in the US [[Library of Congress]]. Most of the performers in the film then belonged to Theatre Academy, Pune.

==Plot==
[[Poona]] was visited by the pestilence of [[bubonic plague]] which took a heavy toll of life. But the plague had another, indirect and far reaching consequence on the politics of the country. The behaviour of the military which was called out to deal with the situation arising from the pestilence caused great indignation. On 22 June 1897, British officer Charles Walter Rand Assistant Collector of Pune and Chairman of the Special Plague Committee, Pune, and British Army officer Lieutenant Charles Egerton Ayerst, were assassinated on the Ganeshkhind road, Pune, on their way back from a Government house party celebrating the Diamond Jubilee anniversary of the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]]. 
C. W. Rand of the ICS was appointed to take charge of the plague control measures and had successfully contained the epidemic; but his methods of evacuating the people, of fumigating their dwellings, and burning the contaminated articles, evoked tremendous hatred amongst certain sections of the society, which led to his assassination. The climax scene is the shooting, after the midnight party finished, the carriages started moving out of the Government House, one of the boys in that group watched from outside the gate. As Rand came out, he gave the signal. Another boy began running with the carriage. As he reached the spot where Damodar, Balkrishna and others were waiting, he shouted to them 'Gondya ala re! (Gondya has come)'. Balkrishna jumped on the carriage and shot the occupant. But there was a mistake. It was Ayerst whom he had killed. They realised their mistake. When Rand's carriage came to the spot, Damodar climbed on it and shot Rand.  Ayerst was killed on the spot, and Rand died in hospital on 3 July 1897.&lt;ref name = "Rudra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Nachiket Patwardhan.jpg|thumb|left|Film's director and producer Nachiket Patwardhan]]
The film was the directorial debut of Jayoo and Nachiket Patwardhan, commissioned by the [[National Film Development Corporation of India]] (NFDC) on a shoestring [[Rupee]]s 350,000 budget. Jayoo Patwardhan scouted for locations in [[Wai, Maharashtra|Wai]] and [[Pune]] for the period look, poring over scores of photographs obtained by her grandfather, and spending months researching the details. The film was shot entirely on locations in Pune, Wai and [[Mumbai]] in March and April 1979. The co-director considers the film ''"a solid piece of history with huge archival value"''. [[Vijay Tendulkar]] its dialogue writer considered that ''"the film is significant because it shows the way history needs to be treated in cinema – in a deglam manner where martyrs are also shown as human beings"'', and judged the effort to be stupendous given the tight budget and other limitations of the time. ''"The dialogues I wrote were brief and simple, just like the script demanded,"'' felt Tendulkar.&lt;ref name ="Sunanda"&gt;{{cite news

===Damodar Hari Chapekar's autobiography===
Damodar Hari's narration of the shooting differs from the events as shown in the film. In his autobiography Damodar Hari writes that he believed the jubilee celebrations would cause Europeans of all ranks to go to the Government House, and this would give them the opportunity to kill Rand. The brothers Damodar Hari and Balkrishna Hari selected a spot of Ganeshkhind road, by the side of a yellow bungalow to shoot at Rand. Each armed with a sword and a pistol. Balkrishna in addition carried a hatchet. They reached Ganeshkhind, they saw what looked like Rand's carriage pass by, but they let it go, not being sure, deciding to attack him on his way back. They reached Government House at 7.00–7.30 in the evening, as darkness was beginning to set in. A large number of people had gathered to witness the spectacle at Government House, and there were bonfires on the hills. The swords and the hatchet they carried made movement without raising suspicion difficult, so they deposited them under a stone culvert near the bungalow, so as to retrieve it in case of need. As planned, Damodar Hari waited at the gate of the Government House, and as Rand's carriage emerged, ran 10–15 paces behind it. As the carriage reached the yellow bungalow, Damodar made up the distance, and called out "Gondya", a predetermined signal for Balkrishna to take action. Damodar Hari undid the flap of the carriage, raised it and fired from a distance of about a span. It was originally planned that both would shoot at Rand, so as to ensure that Rand would not live, however Balkrishna Hari lagged behind and Rand's carriage rolled on, Balkrishna Hari meanwhile on the suspicion that the occupants of the following carriage were whispering to each other, fired at the head of one of them from behind.&lt;ref name = "Autobiography"&gt;{{cite book

== Critical appreciation ==
The book ''One Hundred Indian Feature Films: An Annotated Filmography'', calls the film, made by the Patwardhans, practising architects, a leaf out of history more as an exercise in cinema than in patriotism, faithful in every detail and structurally controlled, an unusual attempt at bringing a new visual perception into the mechanisms of film making. It finds the faces, mostly from [[Marathi language|Marathi]] stage, powerful in their authenticity, chiselled of grim determination, with firelight dancing on them, rugged stone walls, skirting narrow paths, the pillared inner courtyards of traditional dwellings, all into place in an intensely moving dramatic experience.&lt;ref name = "Hundredfilms"&gt;{{cite book|title=One Hundred Indian Feature Films: An Annotated Filmography

Gokulsing et al. write in their book ''Popular Indian Cinema'', that the film cinematises a violent incident in Indian history, the determination of a group of Brahmin youths to challenge two of the elements of British imperialism – the English language and Christianity, the killing of Rand and events before and its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Mukta Rajadhyaksha, [[Mumbai]] based theatre and media critic, writing in [[The Times of India]], considers this film an honourable exception amid the degeneration that Marathi cinema went through after its golden age, the decades of 50s and 60s. She feels that the film should have won the [[Indian National Film Awards#Golden Lotus Award|Golden Lotus]] for best film, but did not as [[Marathi cinema]], unlike cinema from Bengal and the South lacked a powerful lobby at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{About|the play|the work by Beethoven|Diabelli Variations}}
'''''33 Variations''''' is a play by [[Moisés Kaufman]], inspired by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Diabelli Variations]]. It débuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on March 9, 2009, starring [[Jane Fonda]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/fonda-in-33-variations-will-play-oneill-theatre-opening-march-9-2009-155805|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422180736/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/fonda-in-33-variations-will-play-oneill-theatre-opening-march-9-2009-155805|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-04-22|title=Fonda in 33 Variations Will Play O'Neill Theatre, Opening March 9, 2009 - Playbill.com|date=2015-04-22|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally written in 2007, its world première was held at [[Arena Stage]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/33_Variations_An_Ode_to_Joy_20070907|title='33 Variations' - An Ode to Joy|first=Charles|last=Shubow|website=Broadwayworld.com|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14265733|title=Play Dramatizes Beethoven's '33 Variations'|website=Npr.org|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The play simultaneously examines the creative process behind Beethoven's ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' and the journey of a [[musicology|musicologist]], Katherine Brandt, to discover the meaning behind why Beethoven was compelled to write thirty-three distinct variations on a simple theme by a minor music publisher. The progression of her [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) and her relationship with her daughter are also themes of the story, as is Beethoven's growing deafness.

The action takes place both in Beethoven's time and the present, switching back and forth between the two. However, at certain key points, characters from both time periods appear on stage to deliver lines simultaneously, emphasizing the parallels between the exploits of both sets of characters.

==Production history==
The original production was directed by the playwright, Moisés Kaufman, with piano by Diane Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.33variations.com/whos_who.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025183636/http://www.33variations.com/whos_who.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-10-25|title=33 V A R I A T I O N S|date=2016-10-25|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''33 Variations'' premièred at Arena Stage in September 2007, with [[Mary Beth Peil]] as Katherine, [[Laura Odeh]] as her daughter Clara, and [[Graeme Malcolm]] as Beethoven.

A [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] production ran in April 2008 at [[La Jolla Playhouse]]'s [[Mandell Weiss Theatre]], with [[Jayne Atkinson]] as Katherine, [[Zach Grenier]] as Beethoven, and Odeh returning as Clara.

The play premièred on Broadway at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theatre]] in a limited engagement, on March 9, 2009, with [[Jane Fonda]] as Katherine, in her first appearance on Broadway in forty-six years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Grenier returned as Beethoven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.33variations.com/whos_who.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025183636/http://www.33variations.com/whos_who.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-10-25|title=33 V A R I A T I O N S|date=2016-10-25|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sets by [[Derek McLane]]; costumes by Janice Pytel; lighting by David Lander; sound by André J.

'''Air France Flight 296''' was a chartered flight of a new [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-111]] operated by [[Air France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19880626-0|title=ASN Aircraft accident Airbus A320-111 F-GFKC Mulhouse-Habsheim Airport|last=Ranter|first=Harro|website=Aviation Safety Network|access-date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 1988, it crashed while making a low pass over [[Mulhouse–Habsheim Airport]] ([[ICAO]] airport tcode LFGB) as part of the Habsheim Air Show. Most of the crash sequence, which occurred in front of several thousand spectators, was caught on video. The cause of the crash has been the source of major controversy.

This particular flight was not only the A320's first passenger flight (most of those on-board were journalists and raffle winners), but it was also the first public demonstration of any civilian fly-by-wire aircraft.  The low-speed flyover, with landing gear down, was supposed to take place at an altitude of 100 feet (33 metres); instead, the plane performed the flyover at 30 feet, skimmed the treetops of the forest at the end of the runway (which had not been shown on the airport map given to the pilots), and crashed. All the passengers survived the initial impact, but a woman and two children died from smoke inhalation before they were able to escape.

Official reports concluded that the pilots flew too low, too slow, failed to see the forest and accidentally flew into it. The captain, Michel Asseline, disputed the report and claimed an error in the fly-by-wire computer prevented him from applying thrust and pulling up. In the aftermath of the crash, there were allegations that investigators had tampered with evidence, specifically the aircraft's [[flight recorder]]s ("black boxes").

This was the first crash of an A320 aircraft.

==Aircraft==

The aircraft, an [[Airbus A320]]-111, registration F-GFKC, serial number 9, first flew on 6 January 1988, and was delivered to [[Air France]] on 23 June 1988. It was the third A320 delivered to Air France, the launch customer.&lt;ref&gt;https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19880626-0&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flight deck crew ==

Captain Michel Asseline, 44, had been an airline pilot with Air France for almost 20 years and had the following endorsements: [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]], Boeing [[Boeing 707|707]], [[Boeing 727|727]], and [[Boeing 737|737]], and Airbus [[Airbus A300|A300]] and [[Airbus A310|A310]]. He was a highly distinguished pilot with 10,463 flight hours.&lt;ref name="bea.aero"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bea.aero/docspa/1988/f-kc880626/pdf/f-kc880626.pdf |title=Commission D'Enquête |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=24 April 1990 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MJuIKMJe?url=http://www.bea.aero/docspa/1988/f-kc880626/pdf/f-kc880626.pdf |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df=dmy }}{{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; A training captain since 1979, he was appointed to head the company's A320 training subdivision at the end of 1987.  As Air France's technical pilot, he had been heavily involved in test flying the A320 type and had carried out maneuvers beyond normal operational limitations. He had total confidence in the aircraft's computer systems.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"&gt;{{cite book|last=Job|first=Macarthur|authorlink=Macarthur Job|title=Air Disaster Volume 3|year=1998|publisher=Aerospace Publications|location=Australia|isbn=1 875671 34 X|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First Officer Pierre Mazières, 45, had been flying with the company since 1969 and had been a training captain for six years. He was endorsed on the Caravelle, Boeing 707 and 737, and had qualified as an A320 captain three months before the accident.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt; He had 10,853 hours of flight time.&lt;ref name="bea.aero"/&gt;

== Flight plan ==

At the time of the incident, only three of the new aircraft type had been delivered to Air France, and the newest one (in service for two days) had been chosen for the flyover.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

The aircraft was to fly from [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to [[EuroAirport Basel–Mulhouse–Freiburg|Basel–Mulhouse Airport]] for a press conference. Then, sightseeing charter passengers would board and the aircraft would fly the short distance to [[Mulhouse–Habsheim Airport|Habsheim aerodrome]]. The captain would make a low-level fly-pass over Runway 02, climb up and turn back, and repeat the fly-pass over the same runway in the reciprocal direction (Runway 20). This would be followed by a sightseeing trip south to [[Mont Blanc]] before the passengers would be returned to Basel–Mulhouse Airport. Finally, the aircraft would return to Paris.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

The pilots had each had a busy weekend and did not receive the flight plan until the morning of the flight. They received no verbal details about the flyover or the aerodrome itself.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

== Flyover ==

The [[flight plan]] was that as they approached the airfield, they would extend third-stage flap, lower the landing gear, and line up for level flight at {{convert|100|ft|m}}. The captain would slow the aircraft to its minimum flying speed with maximum [[angle of attack]], disable the "alpha floor" (the function that would otherwise automatically increase engine thrust when the angle of attack reached 15°) and rely on the first officer to adjust the engine thrust manually to maintain 100 feet. After the first pass, the first officer would then apply [[Takeoff/Go-around switch|TOGA]] (takeoff, go-around) power and climb steeply before turning back for the second pass.
"I've done it twenty times!" the captain assured his first officer.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

The flyover had been approved by Air France's Air Operations Directorate and Flight Safety Department, and air traffic control and Basel tower had been informed.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

Habsheim aerodrome was too small to be listed in the aircraft's flight computer, thereby requiring a [[visual flight rules|visual approach]]; both pilots were also unfamiliar with the airfield when they began their descent from {{convert|2000|ft|m}} only {{convert|6|nmi|km}} from the field. This distance was too short for them to stabilize the aircraft's altitude and speed for the flyover.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

Additionally, the captain was expecting from the flight plan to do the pass over runway 02 ({{convert|3281|ft|m}} long, paved) and was preparing for that alignment. But as the aircraft approached the field, the flight deck crew noticed that the spectators were gathered beside runway 34R ({{convert|2100|ft|m}} long, grass). This last-minute deviation in the approach further distracted the crew from stabilizing the aircraft's altitude and they quickly dropped to {{convert|40|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

From higher up, the forest at the end of 34R had looked like a different type of grass. But now that the aircraft was performing its flyover at only 30 feet, the crew noticed the aircraft was lower than the now-identified hazard that they were fast approaching.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt; The cockpit voice recorder recorded the first officer's call:

:First officer: "TOGA power! Go-around track!"&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

The crew applied full power and the pilot attempted to climb. However, the elevators did not respond to the pilot's commands, because the A320's computer system engaged its "alpha protection" mode (meant to prevent the aircraft from entering a stall). Less than five seconds later, the turbines began ingesting leaves and branches as the aircraft skimmed the tops of the trees. The combustion chambers clogged and the engines failed. The aircraft fell to the ground.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

Traditionally, pilots respect the inherent dangers of flying at low speeds at low altitude, and normally, a pilot would not attempt to fly an aircraft so close to stalling with the engines at flight idle (minimum thrust setting in flight). But in this instance, the pilots involved did not hesitate to fly the aircraft below its normal minimum flying speed because the  purpose of the flyover was to demonstrate that the aircraft's computer systems would ensure that lift would always be available regardless of how the pilots handled the controls. The captain's experience of flying the aircraft type at the outer limits of its flight performance envelope may have led to overconfidence and complacency.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

== Crash and evacuation ==

During the impact, the right wing was torn off, and the spilling fuel ignited immediately. Two fire trucks at the airshow set off and an ambulance followed. Local emergency services were informed by radio communication.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

In the aircraft, many of the passengers were dazed from hitting their heads on the backs of the seats in front of them. Some passengers had difficulty unfastening their seatbelts because they were unfamiliar with the mechanism (it differs from the type used in car seatbelts). The purser went to announce instructions to the passengers but the public address system handset had been torn off. He then tried to open the left-side forward door, which was blocked by trees. The door opened partway, and the emergency escape slide began inflating while it was stuck partly inside the fuselage. The purser, a passenger, and a flight attendant (a guest from another airline) managed to push the door fully open. In the process, the purser and the passenger were thrown out of the fuselage with the slide landing on top of them. The flight attendant then began evacuating the passengers but they soon began to pile up at the bottom of the slide as their route was blocked by trees and branches. The egress of the passengers was temporarily halted while the purser and another flight attendant began clearing the branches. When the evacuation continued, the flight attendant stayed at the door, helping passengers, until she began suffering from smoke inhalation.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

By this time, the fire had entered the right side of the fuselage through the damaged floor section between seat rows 10 and 15. A passenger tried to open the left-side overwing exit. It would not open, which was fortunate as there was by that time a fire on the left wing.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

The panicking passengers now began pushing toward the front of the cabin. A flight attendant standing in the center of the cabin at seat 12D was pushed into the aisle by a severely burnt passenger from 12F. Then, as she was helping another passenger whose clothes were on fire, she was carried forward by the surge of people rushing to escape. After the rush of people had left and the interior was fast becoming toxic, she stood at the front door and called back into the cabin. There was no reply and the thick black smoke made a visual check impossible, so she exited the fuselage. The evacuation from the rear door had been fast and smooth thanks to the instructions from the flight attendants at the rear of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

The medical team from the airshow arrived and began examining the passengers. Ten minutes after the crash, the first of the fire trucks arrived. But because of the forest, only the smaller vehicles were able to reach the wreckage. Apart from the tail section, the aircraft was consumed by fire.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

Of 136 people on board, three did not escape. One was a disabled boy in seat 4F who was unable to move. Another was a girl in seat 8C, who was unable to remove her seatbelt (her younger brother had removed his own seatbelt but was carried away by the rush of people before he could help his sister). The third was a woman who had reached the front door and then returned to help the girl. Thirty-four passengers required hospitalization for injuries and burns. Both pilots received minor head injuries and also suffered from smoke inhalation and shock.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

== Accident investigation ==

The official investigation was carried out by the ''[[Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile]]'' (BEA), the French air accident investigation bureau, in conjunction with the airline and the aircraft manufacturer.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

===Flight recorders===
The [[flight recorder]]s were found still attached in the unburnt tail section.
The [[Cockpit Voice Recorder]] (CVR) continued to operate for about 1.5 seconds after the initial impact. The [[Flight Data Recorder|Digital Flight Data Recorder]] (DFDR) continued to operate for about one second, then recorded nonsensical data for another two seconds. Interruption of the power occurred forward of the tail section—most probably in the wheel-well area, which was heavily damaged.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

The CVR was read during the night of 26 June at the BEA. The transcription was later clarified with the assistance of the pilots involved. The tape speed was set using the 400&amp;nbsp;Hz frequency of the aircraft's electrical supply and then synchronised with the air traffic control recordings, which included a time track.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

The DFDR was read the same night by the [[Brétigny-sur-Orge Air Base|Brétigny sur Orge]] Flight Test Centre:
* 12:43:44 - the aircraft begins its descent from {{convert|2000|ft|m}}, initially at a rate of {{convert|300|ft|m}} per minute with 'Flaps 1'.
* 12:44:14 - the engine power is reduced to flight idle. Three seconds later, the undercarriage is extended. A further 10 seconds later, 'Flaps 2' is selected.
* 12:44:45 - 'Flaps 3' is selected as the aircraft descends through {{convert|500|ft|m}} at an airspeed of 177 knots.
* 12:45:06 - the aircraft descends through {{convert|200|ft|m}} at an airspeed of 155 knots.
* 12:45:15 - the aircraft, now at {{convert|90|ft|m}}, begins a deviation to the right (maximum bank angle: 30°) to line up with the grass strip 34R.
* 12:45:23 - the aircraft completes the deviation at a height of {{convert|46|ft|m}} and an airspeed of 141 knots. During this manoeuvre, a fluctuation in the radio altimeter height corresponds to the aircraft passing over a patch of trees (whereas before and after this fluctuation, the readings of the radio altimeter and those of the barometric altimeter match perfectly). Three seconds later, the aircraft descends through {{convert|40|ft|m}} at an airspeed of 132 knots. The Captain begins to flare the aircraft (he lifts the nose 4°) to level its flight. The aircraft levels off at {{convert|30|ft|m}}.
* 12:45:30 - nose-up attitude increases to 7°.
* 12:45:35 - nose-up attitude is now 15° and speed is 122 knots. TOGA power is applied. Four seconds later, the aircraft begins striking the treetops.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

===Aircraft and engines===
The investigators found the aircraft to have been airworthy, that its weight and center-of-gravity had been within limits, and that there was no evidence of mechanical or electronic systems failure.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

The flight deck crew believed that the engines had failed to respond to the application of full power.

With the CFM56-5 engines, four seconds are required to go from 29% N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;{{efn|The speed of the Stage 1 fan of a [[turbofan]] engine, expressed as a percentage of normal maximum}} (flight idle) to 67%. It then takes one second more to go from 67 to 83% N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. From the engine parameters recorded on the DFDR and spectral analysis of the engine sounds on the CVR, it was determined that five seconds after TOGA power was applied, the N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; speed of Nº1 engine was 83% while that of Nº2 engine was 84%. Spectral analysis of the engine sounds indicated that 0.6 seconds later, both engines had reached 91% (by this stage, they were starting to ingest vegetation). This response of the engines complied with their certification data.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

===Official report===
The official report from BEA concluded that the probable cause of the accident was a combination of the following:

* Very low flyover height, lower than surrounding obstacles;
* Speed very slow and reducing to reach maximum possible angle of attack;
* Engines speed at flight idle; and
* Late application of go-around power.&lt;ref name="Job 1998 155"/&gt;

Furthermore, the bureau concluded that if the descent below 100 feet was not deliberate, it may have resulted from a failure by the crew to take proper account of the visual and aural information available to them regarding the elevation "above ground level" (AGL) of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{ASN accident|id=19880626-0|accessdate=3 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commission d'Enquête sur l'accident survenu le 26 de juin de 1988 à Mulhouse-Habsheim (68) à l'Airbus A 320, immatriculé F-GFKC – Rapport Final |year=1990 |url=http://www.bea.aero/docspa/1988/f-kc880626/pdf/f-kc880626.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MJuIKMJe?url=http://www.bea.aero/docspa/1988/f-kc880626/pdf/f-kc880626.pdf |archivedate=2 January 2014 }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

The report further recommended that:
* Passengers should be banned from all demonstration flights
* Flight crews should be provided with &amp;ndash; and ensure proper reconnaissance of &amp;ndash; airfields
* Airline company procedures should be reviewed to ensure they comply with official regulations concerning altitude

===Prosecutions===
Captain Asseline, First Officer Mazière, two Air France officials and the president of the flying club sponsoring the air show were all charged with [[involuntary manslaughter]]. All five were found guilty. Asseline was initially sentenced to six months in prison along with 12 months of probation. The others were sentenced to probation. During the appeal process, Asseline's sentence was increased to 10 months of imprisonment along with 10 months of probation. Asseline walked free from the court and said he would appeal to France's Supreme Court, the [[Court of Cassation (France)|''Cour de Cassation'']]. According to [[Law of France|French law]], Asseline was required to submit himself to the prison system before his case could be taken up by the Supreme Court.

===Alternative explanation===

The TV documentary series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'' also reports claims in [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 9 .282009.29|Season 9 Episode 3]] that the flight recorder might have been tampered with and indicated that four seconds had been cut from the tape;  this was shown by playing back a control tower tape and comparing it to the remaining tape. The pilot argues that he attempted to apply thrust earlier than indicated in the flight recorder data. When he increased throttle to level off at 100&amp;nbsp;ft, the engines did not respond. The pilot claims that this indicated a problem with the aeroplane's fly-by-wire system rather than pilot error. After a few seconds he got worried and thought there may have been something like a short circuit in the completely computerized throttle control, and responded by pulling the throttle all the way back then forward again. By that time the aircraft had touched the trees. The show also looks at the theory that it was the computer at fault, not the pilots- because the flight's altitude had fallen below 100&amp;nbsp;ft, the plane's computers automatically believed the flight was landing and therefore it would not allow any drastic maneuvers from either pilots. When they suddenly asked it for more power and lift, it simply ignored them.&lt;ref name="airdisaster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/investigations/af296/af296.shtml |title=AirDisaster.Com: Investigations: Air France 296 |work=airdisaster.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050805082440/http://www.airdisaster.com/investigations/af296/af296.shtml |archivedate=5 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also claimed by the Institute of Police Forensic Evidence and Criminology, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, that the flight data recorders may have been switched and were not the original ones in the aeroplane.&lt;ref name="airdisaster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crashdehabsheim.net/CRenglish%20phot.pdf |title=The Airbus A320 crash at Habsheim, France 26 June 1988 |last1=Roger |first1=Christian |last2= |first2= |date=26 June 1998 |website=crashdehabsheim.net |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airbus made a detailed rebuttal of these claims in a document published in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crashdehabsheim.net/Rapport%20Airbus.pdf |title=The A320 Habsheim accident |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= March 1991 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airbus contends that the independent investigator employed by the filmmakers made an error when synchronising the recordings, based on a misunderstanding of how the "Radio Transmit" parameter on the flight data recorder functioned.

== Dramatization ==
The episode "Blaming the Pilot" of the TV series ''[[Survival in the Sky]]'' featured the accident.

The [[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] TV series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'' featured the accident and subsequent investigation in a season 9 episode titled "Pilot vs. Plane".&lt;ref name="Mayday Pilot vs Plane"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Pilot vs. Plane|series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]|network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Channel]]|season=9|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Air and Simple Gifts''''' is a [[quartet]] composed and arranged&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/20/AR2009012003560.html Inauguration], ''The Washington Post''. Accessed January 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[United States|American]] composer [[John Williams]] for the January 20, 2009, [[Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration|inauguration of Barack Obama]] as [[President of the United States]]. The first public performance of the piece was in [[Washington, D.C.]], immediately prior to Obama taking the oath of office, when musicians [[Anthony McGill]] (clarinet), [[Itzhak Perlman]] (violin), [[Yo-Yo Ma]] (cello) and [[Gabriela Montero]] (piano)&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news|last=Burlingame|first=Jon|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Williams' music to Obama's ears:Ma, Perlman to perform at inauguration|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998645.html?categoryId=16&amp;cs=1|date=2009-01-15|accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; synced their performance to a tape they had recorded two days earlier.&lt;ref name=milli/&gt;  It was the first classical quartet to be performed at a presidential inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Michelle| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/16/eveningnews/main4728539.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]]|title=Yo-Yo Ma Thrilled To Play At Inauguration:Sneak Preview Of Song Cellist Who Has Played For Five Presidents Will Play For Obama |date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama officially became the President while the piece was being performed, at noon, as the [[United States Constitution]] stipulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090120/NEWS/90120064 |title=Students cheer as Obama sworn in |work=[[Times-Herald Record]] |first=Heather |last=Yakin |date=2009-01-20 |accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it appeared that the piece was being performed live, it was in fact mimed while a recording made two days before was fed to the television pool and speakers.&lt;ref name=milli&gt;{{cite news |title=Yo-Yo Milli Vanilli |first=Joel |last=Achenbach |work=The Washington Post |date=January 23, 2009 |accessdate=January 23, 2009 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/achenblog/2009/01/yo_yo_milli_vanilli.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yo-Yo Ma told NPR's ''All Things Considered'' that the piano keys had been decoupled from the hammers, and the bows of the stringed instruments had been soaped to silence them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=On Inauguration Day, Live Music Wasn't |first=Robert |last=Siegel |work=NPR's All Things Considered |date=January 23, 2009 |accessdate=January 23, 2009 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99816993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The performers stated that the cold weather could have affected the tuning and durability of the instruments, making a live performance too risky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/arts/music/23band.html?_r=1&amp;hp |title=The Famous Fingers Were Live, but Their Sounds?

Williams based the piece on the familiar 19th century [[Shaker]] hymn "[[Simple Gifts]]" by [[Joseph Brackett]].&lt;ref name="AP Music"&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Martin |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/wire/sns-ap-inauguration-quartet,0,4400738.story|publisher=[[Associated Press]] | work=[[Newsday]]|title=John Williams' inauguration quartet is a simple gift filled with hope and optimism |date=2009-01-20|accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source piece is famous for its appearance in [[Aaron Copland]]'s ballet ''[[Appalachian Spring]]''.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; Williams chose the selection from Copland, one of Obama's favorite classical composers.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/classicalmusic/2009/01/inaugural_premiere_resonates_w.html |title=Inaugural premiere resonates with Copland |first=Tim |last=Smith |work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=2009-01-20|accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece is slightly under 4.5 minutes. It is structured in roughly three parts.&lt;ref name="AP Music"/&gt; The first section presents the "[[Air (music)|Air]]" material, consisting of a spare, descending [[musical mode|modal]] melody introduced by violin, pensively explored in duet with cello and piano accompaniment. The entrance of the clarinet, playing the "Simple Gifts" theme, signals the beginning of a small set of [[variation (music)|variations]] on that melody.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tommasini|first=Anthony|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/a-new-williams-work-for-a-momentous-occasion/|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=A New Williams Work for a Momentous Occasion|date=2009-01-20|accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Air" melody at first intermingles with the "Gifts" theme, though it is supplanted by increasingly energetic variations.

A '''bamboo cannon''' ({{lang-ms|meriam buluh}}, [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: مريام بولوه ; {{lang-tl|kanyóng kawayan}}; {{Lang-war|lantaka}}, [[Bahasa Indonesia]]: ''meriam bambu'', [[Javanese language|Javanese]]: ''mercon bumbung'') is a type of home-made [[firecracker]] which is popular during the [[Hari Raya]] festive season in [[Malaysia]], and during [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations in the [[Philippines]]. Like other fireworks, bamboo cannons are illegal as stated in Malaysian Explosive Act 1957; more [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] children turn to the more dangerous bamboo cannon as an alternative to commercial firecrackers which were banned by the government.

In Indonesia bamboo cannon is traditional game played by children. It was very popular in the 1990s. Nowadays, it's still played by children in rural areas, where the material (bamboo) is widely available. In [[West Kalimantan]], on the banks of the Kapuas river, there are Bamboo Cannon Festivals, which are celebrated a week before [[Lebaran|Idul Fitri]]. The biggest bamboo cannon in Indonesia broke records of [[Indonesian World Records Museum|Indonesian World Record Museum]] (MURI) in 2007 and again 2009.

== Operation ==
A typical bamboo cannon consists of a large [[bamboo]] node or tube containing some [[water]] to which a little [[calcium carbide]] is added. The carbide reacts immediately with the water releasing [[acetylene]] gas, which has the widest range of [[explosive limit]] of any common chemical&lt;ref&gt;see the [[explosive limit]] table&lt;/ref&gt; and a very low [[minimum ignition energy|ignition energy]]. A sharp report is produced when a flame is introduced into the bamboo chamber. However, the low density of the acetylene/air mixture is such that the total combustion energy is quite low and weak containers such as bamboo or even glass&lt;ref&gt;see [[Big Bang Cannon]], where demonstrations using glass cannons were done&lt;/ref&gt; rarely shatter.  Adding too much carbide does not increase the energy of the explosion but instead weakens it due to high fuel to air ratio{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. After the shot, fresh air is needed in the tube in order to have another explosion after more carbide is added.

The operating principle also works with other combustible fuels besides acetylene, but since most others have narrower explosive limits, the effect is not as reliable.  Common examples are solvent-containing [[aerosol]] consumer products such as [[spray paint]] or [[Hair spray|hairspray]].

Less-volatile fuels can also work, with skill, such as 200ml of hot [[kerosene]], poured into a small hole near the breech of the cannon. A lighting stick is used to ignite the fumes and fire the cannon, then fresh air is blown into the small hole and the cannon fired again. The bamboo used for this is usually around 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter and 4 to 5 feet long.

In the Philippine city of [[Kidapawan City|Kidapawan]], [[North Cotabato]], the ''Kanyóng Kawayan Festival'' is held from 14-20 December to promote safer noisemaking alternatives during the [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]]. Empty [[powdered milk]] cans are common projectiles used in the city-wide contest held during the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KANYONG KAWAYAN FESTIVAL|url=http://tourism.gov.ph/SitePages/FestivitiesList.aspx?festivityCode=636&amp;monthCode=12|website=Department of Tourism|accessdate=26 February 2015|location=Calendar of Festivities|date=2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226160104/http://tourism.gov.ph/SitePages/FestivitiesList.aspx?festivityCode=636&amp;monthCode=12|archive-date=2015-02-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant form, known as ''bong-bong'', is used by the people of [[Mangaldan, Pangasinan]], but with water and motor oil as the fuel.

== Variation ==
A Filipino derivative made from [[PVC piping]] or segmented joined tin cans is colloquially known as a ''[[Boga (noisemaker)|boga]]''. It is operated in much the same way as a bamboo cannon, but is held in the manner of a [[rocket launcher]]. Originating in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Cavite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pinoys find another way to welcome the New Year |pages= |publisher=Manila Bulletin Online |date=2005-12-31 |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/12/31/MTNN2005123152835.html |accessdate=2008-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122045257/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/12/31/MTNN2005123152835.html |archivedate=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; use of the device has been banned by the Philippine government since 2006.&lt;ref name="Bawal2007"&gt;{{cite web|title="Bawal ang Boga", DOH says this holiday season |url=http://www.doh.gov.ph/node/1797 |accessdate=2008-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719074127/http://www.doh.gov.ph/node/1797 |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven applicant cities presented '''bids to host the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and [[2014 Winter Paralympics|Paralympics]]''' (formally known as ''XXII Olympic Winter Games'' and ''XI Paralympic Winter Games'') to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). The IOC Executive Board shortlisted three cities—[[Sochi]], Russia; [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]; and [[Pyeongchang]], [[South Korea]]—with Sochi winning the IOC's July 2007 final vote.

The three selected candidates, chosen on 22 June 2006, delivered to the IOC their Candidature Files (known as ''bid books'') on 10 January 2007. From February to April 2007, an ad hoc committee performed visits to the candidate cities and prepared an evaluation report which was released one month before the election.

The election by [[exhaustive ballot]] took place on 4 July 2007 in [[Guatemala City]] during the 119th IOC Session;&lt;ref name="GamesBids2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/bids/2014.shtml |title=2014 Winter Olympic Games bids |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |accessdate=2007-04-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070323145203/http://www.gamesbids.com/english/bids/2014.shtml| archivedate= 23 March 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sochi beat out Pyeongchang by four votes in the second round of voting to win the rights to host after Salzburg had been eliminated in the first round.

==Candidature procedure and timeline==
[[File:Vladimir Putin speech to IOC in Guatemala City.ogv|thumb|Then [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] addresses the IOC session on 4 July 2007 in [[Guatemala City]] on behalf of the 2014 Sochi bid.]]

===Phase 1: Candidature acceptance procedure===

Bidding cities had to be approved by their national Olympic committees, which have the right to choose between several cities in their respective countries. The cities had to submit their applications to the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] by 28 July 2005. The cities were asked to complete a questionnaire, which they had to submit to the IOC by 1 February 2006. An IOC Working Group then studied their answers in order to help the executive board members select the cities which became candidate cities and went through to the second phase of the process. The executive board of IOC accepted three bids on 22 June 2006.

===Phase 2: Candidature procedure===

The candidate cities were invited to submit their candidature file, which is a detailed description of their Olympic plans, and to prepare for a visit by the IOC Evaluation Commission. This commission undertook a technical analysis of each candidature and then produced a report, which was to be published one month before the host city election and sent to the IOC members for study. The candidature files were submitted on 10 January 2007. The IOC Evaluation Committee visited the candidate cities in February–March 2007 and published its report on 4 June.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

During the 119th IOC Session on 4 July 2007 in [[Guatemala City]], Salzburg received 25 votes (and was relegated), Pyeongchang received 36 votes, and Sochi received 34 votes in the first round of the IOC voting procedure. In the second (and final) round, Pyeongchang received 47 votes, but Sochi received 51 votes and was therefore chosen as the host of the 2014 Olympics.

==Evaluation of the applicant cities==
Each cell of the table provides a minimum and a maximum figure obtained by the applicant city on the specific criteria. These figures are to be compared to a benchmark which has been set at 6.

{{main article|Pyeongchang bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics}}
Pyeongchang was unanimously selected over [[Muju County|Muju]] by the Korean Olympic Committee in December 2004, and was the first city to submit its bid to the International Olympic Committee. The bid launched a full-scale campaign after losing the [[Bids for the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010 race]] by a mere three votes to [[Vancouver]]. The 2014 project concentrated all venues within one hour of Pyeongchang, and called for huge sums of investment into new infrastructure and sporting venues, including the new [[Alpensia Resort]]. Moreover, the sporting event was touted as promoting a message of peace and harmony in the divided country.

Since 2003, the region had been selected to host the 2009 [[Snowboard World Championships]], the 2009 [[Biathlon World Championships]] and the 2009 [[World Women's Curling Championship]], and aimed to become the winter sports hub of Asia. Although an IOC evaluation team complimented the area on levels of public support, government support, and infrastructure in February 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/17/sports/AS-SPT-OLY-SKorea-Winter-Bid.php]&lt;/ref&gt; the bid was also criticized because Pyeongchang was not a popular tourist destination, the venue relied heavily on [[artificial snow]] due to a dry winter climate, most slopes were relatively short, and local amenities were poorly developed.{{cn|date=May 2017}} Pyeongchang was eventually chosen to host the [[2018 Winter Olympics]].

{{main article|Salzburg bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics}}
The Austrian city was eliminated in the first round in voting during the 2010 competition. The 2014 bid was more compact than the 2010 project due to the elimination of the [[Kitzbühel]], [[St. Johann in Tirol|St. Johann]] and [[Ramsau am Dachstein|Ramsau]] venues. The venue for bobsled, skeleton and luge, [[Schönau am Königssee]], was located in Germany.

{{main article|Sochi bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics}}
The Russian [[Black Sea]] resort bid for the Winter Olympics for the second time after failing to make the shortlist in 2002. The primary venue for outdoor sports was the ski resort in [[Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi, Krasnodar Krai|Krasnaya Polyana]], designed by the same company who worked on ski slopes for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], and scheduled to open in 2007. Sochi would host the indoor winter sports. The high number of hotel rooms and strong public and political support from the city were expected to strengthen the bid's chances.

''Note: the cities are listed in the presentation order determined by draw during the IOC Executive Board meeting of 26 October 2005.''

==Applicant cities overview==
The following applicant cities have been approved by their National Olympic Committees&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/media_centre/press_release_uk.asp?release=1438]&lt;/ref&gt; and submitted their applications to the IOC, but were not selected as candidates by the executive board. They all sent their respective questionnaire answers by 1 February 2006. These documents have been made public in the following days.

|-
| colspan=3| Jaca has failed four times in bidding for the Winter Olympics—for the 1998, 2002, 2010, and 2014 Olympics. It has previously hosted the [[1981 Winter Universiade|1981]] and [[1995 Winter Universiade|1995]] [[Winter Universiade]]s, and hosted the [[European Youth Olympic Festival]] in February 2007. Skiing events were proposed to take place at ski resorts of the [[Pyrenees]]: [[Candanchú]], [[Formigal]], [[Astún]] and [[Panticosa-Los Lagos|Panticosa]]. Most of the ice events, as well as the Opening and Closing Ceremonies (at [[La Romareda]] Stadium), were to take place 142 kilometers south of Jaca in [[Zaragoza]]. Preliminary ice hockey competitions were to take place in Jaca and [[Huesca]]. Jaca did bid for 2002 but missed the short list which was limited to [[Östersund]] (Sweden), [[Quebec City]] (Canada), [[Sion, Switzerland|Sion]] (Switzerland) and [[Salt Lake City]] from the US, the eventual host.

One of the main reasons that Jaca didn't make the short list is that the Opening and Closing Ceremonies were not scheduled to take place in Jaca which is in contradiction with article 34.1 of the [[Olympic Charter]].

|-
| colspan=3| Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, submitted its official bid for the 2014 Olympics to the International Olympic Committee. The city had already planned to host the [[2011 Winter Asian Games]]. The National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan cited that the city would have used existing indoor sports facilities and the Chimbulak Mountain ski slopes. The bid was quite compact with all the ice events in downtown Almaty and the alpine events in nearby Kumbel. The farthest events would have been in the Soldatskoe Valley venue, only 45&amp;nbsp;km away from the center of Almaty and the Olympic Village. The historic [[Medew]] ice rink would have been the speed skating venue and would have been covered for the Games. It bears to mention that based on the scores released by the executive committee report, Almaty placed fourth overall, and would have been eligible for the shortlist as it had cleared the benchmark for some categories. However, IOC president Jacques Rogge commented that in the process of shortlisting in order to determine an Olympic Host City, what matters was 'not quantity, but the quality' of the overall bids. Although Almaty presented a good bid, it was implied that it was not as feasibly up-to-par as the three that were selected to enter the shortlist.

|-
| colspan=3| Sofia submitted its application in the city's third attempt to land the Winter Games, after losing the 1992 and 1994 nominations to [[Albertville]] and [[Lillehammer]], respectively. The proposed Olympics was based on three main centers: Sofia itself, [[Borovets]] and [[Bansko]]. Sofia would have hosted the ice events and bobsleigh and luge events in nearby [[Vitosha]] natural park. The ambitious multimillion-euro Super [[Borovets]] (70&amp;nbsp;km away) expansion project was a further signal of Bulgaria's continual investment into infrastructure and would have hosted cross country skiing, freestyle skiing and snowboarding events. Near Sofia is located also the fast developing [[Bansko]] resort (159&amp;nbsp;km). Bansko, the site of the 2007 European biathlon championship, would have hosted the biathlon and alpine skiing events. The city's bid also seemed to had gained significant political support within the country and thus sent in its application early on 17 April 2004. Sofia missed the 2014 shortlist on 22 June 2006. According to experts, the main reason for the 2014 elimination was the lack of detailed information provided in the reply to the IOC's questionnaire.

|-
| colspan=3| Despite the lack of sports infrastructure, Georgia reportedly had the money and the will to host the Winter Olympics. The Games were proposed to be held in two locations: Borjomi and Tbilisi, which are about 200&amp;nbsp;km apart.

Borjomi was the proposed venue for the outdoor sports disciplines (Alpine Skiing, Biathlon, Bobsleigh, Cross Country Skiing, Freestyle Skiing, Luge, Nordic Combined, Skeleton, Ski Jumping and Snowboard), while [[Tbilisi]] was expected to host the indoor sports disciplines (Curling, Figure Skating, Ice-Hockey, Short Track Speed Skating and Speed Skating). The Opening and Closing Ceremonies were expected to take place in the natural amphitheatre in the centre of [[Bakuriani]], a suburb of Borjomi. Bakuriani would also have been the venue for the cross country and freestyle skiing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9678">The World Championship is an annual competition started in 1955 for [[BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars]]. It is the premier championship of the formula and the winner is granted the honour of racing with a gold roof and wing until the next World Final, and if desired they can race under number 1.

==Qualification==
The World Final is usually held in September. The host tracks, all of which are based in the UK, are decided by the BriSCA promoters.

The grid for the World Final is mostly composed of drivers from the UK who are chosen through a series of qualifying rounds and two World Championship Semi-Finals. Drivers who fail to progress from the World Semi-Finals may race again in a Consolation Semi-Final to choose two more entrants, and the reigning World Champion is entitled to start at the rear of the grid if they have not already qualified. The UK drivers are joined by stock car drivers from the Netherlands, and by invited drivers in the nearest equivalent motorsport formulas from other countries often including Australia, [[Superstocks|New Zealand]], South Africa and the USA.

The most successful driver in World Final races is [[John Lund (racing driver)|John Lund]], who has won eight. Other notable multiple winners include Stuart Smith (six), Andy Smith (five), Peter Falding (four), Johnny Brise, Dave Chisholm and [[Frankie Wainman Junior]] (three).

==List of winners==
There were two races promoted as the World Championship in 1955, at [[Harringay Stadium|Harringay]] and [[Hyde_Road_(speedway)|Belle Vue]].

All drivers are British, except where marked.

{{Campaignbox Roman-Persian Wars}}
The '''Byzantine–Sasanian wars''', also known as the '''Irano-Byzantine wars'''&lt;ref&gt;''Sasanian Dynasty'', A. Shapur Shahbazi, '''Encyclopaedia Iranica''', (July 20, 2005),[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sasanian-dynasty]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a series of conflicts between the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]]  and the [[Sassanian Empire]] of [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. A continuation of the [[Roman–Persian Wars|Roman–Persian War]]s, the conflict involved several smaller campaigns and peace treaties lasting for years at a time.

==Strategy and tactics==


====Roman strategy====
The Roman Empire had reached its greatest extent under the Emperor [[Trajan]]. However, before Trajan, the Emperor [[Augustus]] set about stabilizing the frontiers of the Empire. As a result, the Romans were more interested in simply defending their territory and consolidating the Empire rather than in attempting to conquer Persia.
w
The Romans employed the best infantry of the time: heavily armed and armored soldiers plus numerous auxiliaries. By the 4th century A.D., armor was less often used, and by the 5th century, Germanic mercenaries were employed. The Romans continued to use heavy infantry of the legionary type, but these were less mobile than the Persian horse archers, although more effective in attrition warfare. From the 3rd century heavy [[cataphract]] cavalry wearing full horse and rider armor became an increasingly important component of Roman armies.

===Persians===

====Sasanian strategy====
The Sasanian dynasty had a more or less secure northern and eastern border due to the mountainous terrain of the [[Caucasus]], Middle Asia and Afghanistan. The Western border was determined by Sassanid control of Mesopotamia. Due to the flat nature of the land, it was easy to overrun and difficult to defend. With these natural boundaries, the Sasanian Persians had only Westward to expand. The Sasanians were becoming as efficient in siege warfare as the Romans, capturing and sacking a number of cities as part of a larger goal of exacting tribute and land from the Romans. However, the nature of the warfare was one of attrition with heavy casualties on both sides. As a result, little land was exchanged between the two powers; rather, vassal states and tribute would have been demanded.

====Sasanian tactics====
The Sassanid Persians employed cavalry archers and heavy cataphracts to counter the heavy Roman infantry. In battle, these archers had varying degrees of effect. Soon the Romans began to adopt similar methods of warfare.

==Rise of the Sasanian dynasty==
[[File:Sassanid-empire.gif|thumb|left|Areas under Sasanian control varied, but were for the most part composed of modern-day Iran and eastern Iraq. However, Mesopotamia was a frequent battleground that neither the Romans nor the Sasanian could fully control.]]

Following Trajan's successful conquest of Mesopotamia in the 2nd century, the [[Parthian Empire]] began to decline. [[Ctesiphon]] was overrun by the Romans but the lack of any permanent establishment meant that the Sassanid dynasty filled the power vacuum in the region and started a new Persian Empire in 224. The Sasanians were a more aggressive enemy than their Parthian predecessors and consequently, the Romans found themselves fighting a more dangerous Eastern opponent at a time when the Roman Empire was weakening due to the civil chaos arising from the death of the Roman Emperor [[Commodus]].

==Early Roman-Sasanian conflicts==
[[File:HumiliationValerianusHolbein.jpg|thumb|The Humiliation of Valerian by Shapur ([[Hans Holbein the Younger]], 1521, pen and black ink on a chalk sketch, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]]).]]
Persian-Roman conflict was renewed shortly after the overthrowing of the Parthian rule and the foundation of the Sasanian empire by [[Ardashir I]] (226&amp;ndash;241), who raided in [[Mesopotamia]] and Syria in 230, demanding the restitution of the [[Achaemenid]] possessions in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'', VI, [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre602.html 2.1–6]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXX, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html 4.1–2]&lt;br/&gt;* Dodgeon-Greatrex-Lieu (2002), I, 16&lt;/ref&gt; After fruitless negotiations, [[Alexander Severus]] set out against Ardashir in 232; one column of his army marched successfully into Armenia, while two other columns operated to the south and failed, mostly on account of physical hardship. In any case Ardashir was repulsed and Alexander Severus celebrated a triumph in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'', VI, [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre605.html 5.1–6]&lt;br/&gt;* Dodgeon-Greatrex-Lieu (2002), I, 24–28; Frye (1968), 124&lt;/ref&gt; In 238–240, towards the end of his reign, Ardashir attacked again, taking several cities in Syria and Mesopotamia, including [[Carrhae]], Nisibis and [[Hatra]].&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1968), 124–125; Southern (2001), 234–235&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle resumed and intensified under Ardashir's successor [[Shapur I]]; he invaded Mesopotamia but his forces were defeated at a [[Battle of Resaena|battle]] near [[Resaena]] in 243; Carrhae and Nisibis were retaken by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1968), 125&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by this success, the emperor [[Gordian III]] advanced down the Euphrates but was defeated near [[Ctesiphon]] in the [[Battle of Misiche]] in 244. Gordian either died in the battle or was murdered by his own men; [[Philip the Arab|Philip]] became emperor, and paid 500,000 [[denarii]] to the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, ''Liber de Caesaribus'', 27.[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#27 7–8]; Sibylline Oracles, XIII, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/sib/sib13.htm 13–20]&lt;br/&gt;* Frye (1968), 125; Southern (2001), 235&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 250s, Philip was involved in a struggle over the control of Armenia. Shapur had the Armenian king murdered, and re-opened hostilities against Rome; he defeated the Roman troops at the [[Battle of Barbalissos]], and then probably took and plundered [[Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1968), 125; Southern (2001), 235–236&lt;/ref&gt; Some time between 258 and 260, Shapur captured the emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] after crushing his army at the [[Battle of Edessa]], but his subsequent advance into Anatolia ended, when [[Odaenathus]], the ruler of [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyra]], attacked detachments of the Persians, causing them to retreat to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/lactantius/demort.shtml 5]; Sibylline Oracles, XIII, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/sib/sib13.htm 155–171]&lt;br/&gt;* Frye (1968), 126; Southern (2001), 238&lt;/ref&gt;

In 275 and 282 [[Aurelian]] and [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] respectively planned to invade Persia, but they were both murdered before they were able to fulfill their plans.&lt;ref&gt;Dodgeon-Greatrex-Lieu (2002), I, 108–109, 112; Southern (2001), 241&lt;/ref&gt; In 283 the emperor [[Carus]] launched a successful invasion of Persia, sacking its capital, Ctesiphon; they would probably have extended their conquests, if Carus had not died in December of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, ''Liber de Caesaribus'', 38.[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#38 2–4]; Eutropius, ''Abridgment of Roman History'', IX, [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#18 18.1]&lt;br/&gt;* Frye (1968), 128; Southern (2001), 241&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief period of peace during [[Diocletian]]'s early reign, [[Narseh]] renewed hostilities with the Romans invading Armenia, and defeated [[Galerius]] not [[Battle of Carrhae (296)|far from Carrhae]] in 296 or 297.&lt;ref name="Frye 1968"&gt;Frye (1968), 130; Southern (2001), 242&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 298 Galerius defeated Narseh at the [[Battle of Satala (298)|Battle of Satala]], sacked the capital Ctesiphon and captured the Persian treasury and royal harem. The Roman victory was the most decisive for many decades: many cities east of the Tigris were given to the Romans including [[Tigranocerta|Tigranokert]], [[Siirt|Saird]], [[Silvan, Diyarbakır|Martyropolis]], [[Bitlis|Balalesa]], [[Bakhchisaray|Moxos]], [[Duhok, Iraq|Daudia]], and Arzan. Also, control of Armenia was given to the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor, ''Liber de Caesaribus'', 39.[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#39 33–36]; Eutropius, ''Abridgment of Roman History'', IX, [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#18 24–25.1]&lt;br/&gt;* Frye (1968), 130–131; Southern (2001), 243&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peace of Nisibis (299)|arrangements of 299]] proved long-lasting. It was [[Shapur II]] who broke the long peace between the two empires in mid 330s, and mounted a series of offensives against the Romans with little lasting effect.&lt;ref name="Frye 1968" /&gt; Shapur launched a new campaign in 359, successfully [[Siege of Amida|laying siege to Amida]], and provoked a major offensive in 363 by the Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]].&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1968), 137&lt;/ref&gt; Despite victory&lt;ref&gt;Browning, Robert ''The Emperor Julian'' University of California Press (Nov 1978) {{ISBN|978-0-520-03731-1}} p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wacher, J.S. ''The Roman World, Volume 1'' Routledge; 2 edition (12 Mar 2001) {{ISBN|978-0-415-26315-3}} p.143&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (363)|Battle of Ctesiphon]], Julian was unable to capture the fortified city itself. He was killed the same year at the [[Battle of Samarra]], during a difficult retreat along the [[Tigris]]. His successor [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] found his army in a disadvantageous position, and was forced to hand over the former Roman possessions east of the Tigris, as well as Nisiris and Singara; Armenia was also abandoned by the Romans, and was soon conquered by Shapur.&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1968), 138&lt;/ref&gt;

In 383 or 384 Armenia again became a bone of contention between the Roman and the Sasanian empires, but hostilities did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1968), 141&lt;/ref&gt; With both empires preoccupied by barbarian threats from the north, a largely peaceful period followed, interrupted only by two brief wars, the [[Roman-Sassanid war (421-422)|first in 421–422]] after [[Bahram V]] persecuted high-ranking Persian officials who had converted to [[Christianity]], and the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 440|second in 440]], when [[Yazdegerd II]] raided Roman Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1923), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/14*.html XIV.1]; Frye (1968), 145; Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 37–51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anastasian War==
[[File:Roman-Persian Frontier, 5th century.png|thumb|250px|right|The Roman-Persian frontier prior to the Anastasian War.]]
{{details|Anastasian War}}
The Anastasian War ended the longest period of peace the two powers ever enjoyed. It broke out when the Roman emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] refused to provide financial support to the Persian king, [[Kavadh I]], who tried to gain the money by force.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''Wars'', I.7.1–2&lt;br&gt;* Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 62&lt;/ref&gt; In 502 Kavadh quickly captured the unprepared city of [[Theodosiopolis (Armenia)|Theodosiopolis]],&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 62&lt;/ref&gt; and then besieged the fortress-city of [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]] through the autumn and winter (502–503). The siege of the city proved to be a far more difficult enterprise than Kavadh expected; the defenders repelled the Persian assaults for three months before being defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 63&lt;/ref&gt; In 503 the Romans attempted an ultimately unsuccessful siege of the Persian-held Amida while Kavadh invaded Osroene, and laid siege to Edessa with the same results.&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002),I I, 69–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally in 504, the Romans gained the upper hand with the renewed [[investment (military)|investment]] of Amida, leading to the hand-over of the city. That year an armistice was agreed to as a result of an invasion of Armenia by the [[Hun]]s from the Caucasus. Negotiations between the two powers took place, but such was their distrust that in 506 the Romans, suspecting treachery, seized the Persian officials.  Once released, the Persians preferred to stay in Nisibis.&lt;ref name="Greatrex-Lieu 2002, II, 77"&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 77&lt;/ref&gt; In November, 506, a treaty was finally agreed upon, but little is known of what the terms of the treaty were. [[Procopius]] states that peace was agreed for seven years, and it is likely that some payments was made to the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''Wars'', I.9.24&lt;br&gt;* Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

In 505 Anastasius ordered the building of a great fortified city at [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]].  The dilapidated fortifications were also upgraded at Edessa, Batnac and Amida.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua the Stylite, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/joshua_the_stylite_02_trans.htm XC]&lt;br&gt;* Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 74&lt;/ref&gt; Although no further large-scale conflict took place during Anastasius' reign, tensions continued, especially while work continued at Dara. This construction project was to become a key component of the Roman defenses, and also a lasting source of controversy with the Persians, who complained that it violated the treaty of 422, by which both empires had agreed not to establish new fortifications in the frontier zone. Anastasius, however, pursued the project, and the walls were completed by 507/508.&lt;ref name="Greatrex-Lieu 2002, II, 77" /&gt;

==Iberian War==
[[File:NE 500ad.jpg|thumb|left|Roman and Persian Empires in 500 AD, also showing their neighbors, many of whom were dragged into wars between the great powers.]]
{{details|Iberian War}}
In 524/525 Kavadh proposed to [[Justin I]] to adopt his son, [[Khosrau I|Khosrau]]. The proposal was initially greeted with enthusiasm by the Roman emperor and his nephew, [[Justinian]], but Justin's ''[[quaestor sacri palatii|quaestor]]'', Proculus, opposed the move. Despite the final breakdown of the negotiations, it was not until 530 that full-scale warfare on the main eastern frontier broke out. In the intervening years, the two sides preferred to wage war by proxy, through [[Arab]] allies in the south and [[Huns]] in the north.&lt;ref name="Gl81-82"&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions between the two powers were further heightened by the defection of the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberian]] king Gourgen to the Romans: in 524/525 the Iberians rose in revolt against Persia, following the example of the neighboring Christian kingdom of [[Lazica]], and the Romans recruited Huns from the north of the Caucasus to assist them.&lt;ref name="Gl82"&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

By 526–527, overt fighting between the two empires had broken out in the [[Transcaucasus]] region and upper Mesopotamia. At the same time, the Persians continued to exert pressure on the Romans to obtain funds from them.&lt;ref name="Gl84"&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 84&lt;/ref&gt; The early years of war favored the Persians: by 527 the Iberian revolt had been crushed, a Roman offensive against Nisibis and Thebetha in that year was unsuccessful and forces trying to fortify [[Tell Tuneinir|Thannuris]] and Melabasa were prevented from doing so by Persian attacks.&lt;ref name="Gl85"&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Attempting to remedy the deficiencies revealed by these Persian successes, the new Roman emperor, Justinian I, reorganized the eastern armies.&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 83&lt;/ref&gt; In 528 [[Belisarius]] tried unsuccessfully to protect Roman workers in Thannuris, undertaking the construction of a fort right on the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 86&lt;/ref&gt; Damaging raids on Syria by the [[Lakhmids]] in 529 encouraged Justinian to strengthen his own Arab allies, helping the [[Ghassanid]] leader [[Al-Harith ibn Jabalah]] turn a loose coalition into a coherent kingdom.
[[File:Battle of Dara-battleplan.png|thumb|Plan of the Battle of Dara]]

In 530 the Romans defeated the Persian troops at [[Battle of Dara|Dara]] and [[Satala]]. In 531 Belisarius was defeated by Persian and Lakhmid forces at the [[Battle of Callinicum]], but, during the summer of the same year, the Romans captured some forts in Armenia, and effectively repulsed the Persian offensive.&lt;ref name="GL92-96"&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 92–96&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the Roman failure at [[Raqqa|Callinicum]], which resulted in the dismissal of Belisarius, unsuccessful negotiations between Justinian's envoy, Hermogenes, and Kavadh took place.&lt;ref name="GL93"&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 93&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian then took steps to bolster the Roman position, trying, at the same time, to engage Kavadh diplomatically. In spring 532 negotiations re-opened between the Roman envoys and the new Persian king, Khosrau I, who needed to secure his own position. The two sides finally came to an agreement, and the Eternal Peace, which lasted less than eight years, was signed in September 532. Both powers agreed to return all occupied territories and the Romans to make a one-off payment of 110 ''centenaria'' (11,000&amp;nbsp;lbs of gold). The Romans recovered the Lazic forts, and Iberia remained in Persian hands, but the Iberians who had left their country were allowed to either remain in Roman territory or return to their native land.&lt;ref&gt;Evans (2000), 118; Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascendancy of Khosrau I==
[[File:ChosroesHuntingScene.JPG|thumb|left|Hunting scene showing king Khosrau I (7th century [[Persian-Sassanid art patterns|Sasanian art]], [[Cabinet des Medailles]], [[Paris]]).]]
The successful campaigns of Belisarius in the west encouraged the Persians to return to war, both taking advantage of Roman preoccupation elsewhere and seeking to check the expansion of Roman territory and resources.&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 102&lt;/ref&gt; In 539 the resumption of hostilities was foreshadowed by a Lakhmid raid led by [[al-Mundhir IV]], which was defeated by the Ghassanids under al-Harith ibn Jabalah. In 540, the Persians broke the "Treaty of Eternal Peace" and Khosrau I invaded Syria, destroying the great city of [[Antioch]] and deporting its population to [[Weh Antiok Khosrow]] in Persia; as he withdrew, he extorted large sums of money from the cities of Syria and Mesopotamia and systematically looted the key cities. In 541 he invaded Lazica in the north.&lt;ref name="BrJustFPW"&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-3802 Justinian I – Foreign Policies and Wars]" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sasanides in Byzantine palace.jpg|thumb|Right|Relief of a Sassanian delegation in Byzantium, marble, 4th–5th century, [[Istanbul Archaeological Museums]].]]
Belisarius was quickly recalled by Justinian to the East to deal with the Persian threat, while the [[Ostrogoths]] in Italy, who were in touch with the Persian King, launched a counter-attack under [[Totila]].   Belisarius took the field and waged an inconclusive campaign against [[Nisibis]] in 541. In the same year Lazica switched its allegiance to Persia and Khosrau led an army to secure the kingdom. In 542 Khosrau launched another offensive in Mesopotamia, and unsuccessfully attempted to capture [[Resafa|Sergiopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''Wars'', II.20.17–19&lt;br&gt;* Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; He soon withdrew in the face of an army under Belisarius, en route sacking the city of Callinicum.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''Wars'', II.21.30–32&lt;br&gt;* Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 110&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks on a number of Roman cities were repulsed and the Persian general Mihr-Mihroe was defeated and captured at [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]] by [[John Troglita]].&lt;ref&gt;Corripus, ''Johannidos'', I.68–98&lt;br&gt;* Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 111&lt;/ref&gt;

(The war dragged on under other generals and was to some extent hindered by the so-called [[Plague of Justinian]], because of which Khosrau temporarily withdrew from Roman territory&lt;ref name="BrJustFPWGL"&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 110; "[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-3802 Justinian I – Foreign Policies and Wars]" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 543, the Romans fielded a force of 30,000 troops commanded by the ''magister militum'' of the East, Martin, for an invasion of Persian-controlled Armenia. They launched an offensive against [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]], but were defeated by a small Persian force at Anglon. In 544 Khosrau besieged Edessa without success and was eventually bought off by the defenders. The Edessenes paid five ''centenaria'' to Khosrau, and the Persians departed after nearly two months.&lt;ref name="GL113"&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 113&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the Persian retreat, two Roman envoys, the newly appointed magister militum, Constantinus, and Sergius proceeded to Ctesiphon to arrange a truce with Khosrau.&lt;ref name="GL113Pr"&gt;Procopius, ''Wars'', 28.7–11&lt;br&gt;* Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 113&lt;/ref&gt; A five-year truce was agreed in 545, secured by Roman payments to the Persians.&lt;ref name="EvJuPrGr"&gt;Procopius, ''Wars'', 28.7–11&lt;br&gt;* Evans, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/justinia.htm Justinian (527–565 A.D.)]; Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lazic War==
[[File:Roman-Persian Frontier, 565 AD.png|thumb|The Byzantine-Persian border at the time of Justinian's death in 565 AD.]]
{{details|Lazic War}}
In early 548 AD, king Gubaz of [[Lazica]], having found Persian protection oppressive, asked Justinian to restore the Roman protectorate. The emperor seized the chance, and in 548/549 AD combined Roman and Lazic forces under Gubaz and the magister militum of Armenia [[Dagisthaeus|Dagistheus]] won a series of victories against Persian armies under Mihr-Mihroe and Khorianes, [[Siege of Petra (549)|but failed]] in repeated attempts to take the fort of [[Petra (Lazica)|Petra]] (present-day [[Tsikhisdziri]], north of [[Batumi]]).&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold (1997), 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; In 551 AD, general Bassas who replaced Dagistheus put [[Abasgia]] and the rest of Lazica under control, and finally subjected Petra, demolishing its fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold (1997), 205–207&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, however, a Persian army under Mihr-Mihroe but was defeated with heavy losses.&lt;ref name="F236"&gt;Farrokh (2007), 236&lt;/ref&gt; That year the truce which had been established in 545 AD was renewed outside Lazica for a further five years, with the Romans paying 2,000&amp;nbsp;lbs of gold each year.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold (1997), 209&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans failed to completely expel the Sasanian from Lazica, and in 554 AD Mihr-Mihroe launched a new attack, and captured the fortress of Telephis, which was commanded by general Martin.&lt;ref name="F236" /&gt;

In 557 AD Khusro, who had now to deal with the [[Huna (people)|White Huns]], dispatched his envoy Izedh Gushnap to Constantinople and renewed the truce, this time without excluding Lazica, where they kept only a toehold; negotiations continued for a definite peace treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold (1997), 211&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 561 AD, Justinian's envoy, [[Peter the Patrician]], and Izedh Gushnap put together a 50-year peace. The Persians agreed to evacuate Lazica, and received an annual subsidy of 30,000 ''[[nomismata]]'' annually. Both sides agreed not to build new fortifications near the frontier and to ease restrictions on diplomacy and trade between the two empires.&lt;ref name="EvJu"&gt;Evans, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/justinia.htm Justinian (527–565 A.D.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==War for the Caucasus==
[[File:Persia 600ad.jpg|thumb|left|The Sasanian empire and its neighbors (including the Eastern Roman Empire) in 600 AD]]
{{details|Byzantine–Sasanian War of 572–591}}
The war began, when the Armenians revolted against Sasanian rule in early 572 AD. [[Justin II]] took them under his protection, and sent his nephew, Marcian, against the Persians. Roman troops raided [[Arzanene]], and invaded Persian Mesopotamia, defeating its local forces.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold (1997), 222&lt;/ref&gt; Marcian's sudden dismissal, however, and the arrival of troops under Khosrau resulted in the ravaging of Syria, the failure of the Roman  siege of Nisibis, and the fall of Dara.&lt;ref&gt;The great bastion of the Roman frontier was in Persian hands for the first time (Whitby [2000], 92–94).&lt;/ref&gt; At a cost of 45,000 ''[[Solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' a one-year truce (later in the year extended to five years&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 152; Louth (2005), 113&lt;/ref&gt;) was arranged, though the Persians still wanted to restore control in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;Theophanes, ''Chronicle'', 246.11–27&lt;br/&gt;* Whitby (2000), 92–94&lt;/ref&gt;

In 576 AD Khosrau I attempted to combine aggression in Armenia with discussion of a permanent peace. He failed however to take Theodosiopolis, and after a confrontation near [[Malatya|Melitene]] the Persian royal baggage was captured; there were severe Persian losses either in set battle or during a disorganized fleet over the Euphrates.&lt;ref name="TW95"&gt;Theophylact, ''History'', I, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090326055645/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/sasanika/pdf/Theophylact.pdf 9.4]&lt;br/&gt; Treadgold (1997), 224; Whitby (2000), 95&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans exploited Persian disarray by invading deep into Persian territory, raiding [[Atropatene]].&lt;ref name="TW95" /&gt; Persian confidence revived, when [[Tamkhusro]] defeated [[Justinian (general)|Justinian]] in [[Persian Armenia]], where Roman actions had alienated local inhabitants.&lt;ref name="TW96"&gt;Treadgold (1997), 224; Whitby (2000), 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 578 AD the Persians raided Byzantine Mesopotamia; the Roman general [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] retaliated by invading Arzanene; he also took and garrisoned the stronghold of Aphumon,and sacked Singara in Persian Mesopotamia. Khosrau I died early the next year, defeated after so many victories.&lt;ref&gt;Soward, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090326055645/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/sasanika/pdf/Theophylact.pdf Theophylact Simocatta and the Persians]; Treadgold (1997), 225; Whitby (2000),96&lt;/ref&gt;

In 580, Hormizd IV abolished the [[Caucasian Iberia]]n monarchy, and turned Iberia into [[Sasanian Iberia|a Persian province]] ruled by a ''[[marzpan]]'' (governor).{{sfn|Suny|1994|p=25}}{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|page=529}} During the 580s the war continued in inconclusive fashion, with victories on both sides. In 582 AD Maurice defeated Tamkhusro, who was killed, but the Roman general did not follow up his victory; he had to hurry to Constantinople to pursue his imperial ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Soward, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090326055645/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/sasanika/pdf/Theophylact.pdf Theophylact Simocatta and the Persians]; Treadgold (1997), 226; Whitby (2000),96&lt;/ref&gt; In 589 AD the Persians achieved a last success, capturing [[Silvan, Turkey|Martyropolis]] through treachery, but in the same year the stalemate was shattered when the Persian general [[Bahram Chobin]], having been dismissed and humiliated by [[Hormizd IV]], raised a rebellion. Hormizd was overthrown in a palace coup in 590 AD and replaced by his son [[Khosrau II]], but Bahram pressed on with his revolt regardless and the defeated Khosrau was soon forced to flee for safety to Roman territory, while Bahram took the throne as Bahram VI. With support from Maurice, Khosrau raised a rebellion against Bahram, and in 591 AD the combined forces of his supporters and the Romans defeated Bahram, restoring Khosrau II to power and bringing the war to an end. In exchange for their help, Khosrau not only returned Dara and Martyropolis but also agreed to cede the western half of Iberia and more than half of Persian Armenia to the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Theophylact, V, ''History'', I, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090326055645/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/sasanika/pdf/Theophylact.pdf  3.11] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20090326055645/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/sasanika/pdf/Theophylact.pdf 15.1]&lt;br&gt;* Louth (2005), 115; Treadgold (1997), 231–232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climax==
{{See also|Byzantine-Sasanian War of 602-628|Siege of Constantinople (626)}}
[[File:Byzantine and Sassanid Empires in 600 CE.png|thumb|left|400px|Byzantine and Sasanian Empires in 600 CE]]
During [[Maurice's Balkan campaigns]], he and his family were murdered by [[Phocas]] in November 602 after a mutiny.  Khosrau II seized this opportunity to attack the Roman Empire and reconquer the Roman province of Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Foss (1975), 722&lt;/ref&gt; The war initially went the Persians' way, partly because of Phocas' brutal repression and the succession crisis that ensued as the general Heraclius sent his nephew [[Nicetas (cousin of Heraclius)|Nicetas]] to attack [[Egypt]], enabling his son Heraclius the younger to claim the throne in 610. Phocas, an unpopular ruler who is invariably described in Byzantine sources as a "tyrant", was eventually deposed by Heraclius, who sailed to Constantinople from [[Carthage]] with an icon affixed to the prow of his ship.&lt;ref&gt;Haldon (1997), 41; Speck (1984), 178.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SassanianEmpireHistoryofIran.png|thumb|right|The Sasanian Empire at its greatest extent ca. 620 AD]]

By this time the Persians had conquered Mesopotamia and the Caucasus, and in 611 they overran Syria and entered Anatolia. A major counter-attack led by Heraclius two years later was decisively defeated outside [[Antioch]] by [[Shahrbaraz]] and [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan|Shahin]] and the Roman position collapsed; the Persians devastated parts of Asia Minor, and captured [[Chalcedon]] on the [[Bosporus]].&lt;ref&gt;Chronicon Paschale, [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Paschale_I_1832.pdf 706–709]&lt;br/&gt;* Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 194–195&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following decade the Persians were able to conquer [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and Egypt (by mid-621 the whole province was in their hands&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu(2002), II, 196&lt;/ref&gt;) and to devastate Anatolia,&lt;ref&gt;The mint of [[Nicomedia]] ceased operating in 613, and [[Rhodes]] fell to the invaders in 622/623 (Greatrex-Lieu(2002), II, 197).&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] and [[Sclaveni|Slavs]] took advantage of the situation to overrun the [[Balkans]], bringing the Roman Empire to the brink of destruction. The Persians continued with their successful offensive, capturing [[Ancyra]], an important military base in central Anatolia, in 620 or 622. [[Rhodes]] and several other islands in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] fell in 622/3, threatening a naval assault on Constantinople.{{sfn|Kia|2016|page=223}}{{sfn|Greatrex|Lieu|2005|page=197}}{{sfn|Howard-Johnston|2006|page=33}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foss|1975|p=725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the despair in Constantinople that Heraclius considered moving the government to [[Carthage]] in Africa.&lt;ref name = "Kaegi88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA88 88]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, Heraclius strove to rebuild his army, slashing non-military expenditure, devaluing the currency and melting down Church plate, with the backing of [[Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople|Patriarch Sergius]], to raise the necessary funds to continue the war.&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu(2002), II, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cherub plaque Louvre MRR245.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cherub]] and Heraclius receiving the submission of Khosrau II; plaque from a cross ([[Champlevé]] [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] over gilt copper, 1160–1170, [[Paris]], [[Louvre]]).]]
On April 5 622, Heraclius left Constantinople, entrusting the city to Sergius and general [[Bonus (patrician)|Bonus]] as regents of his son. He assembled his forces in Asia Minor, probably in [[Bithynia]], and, after he revived their broken morale, he launched a new counter-offensive, which took on the character of a holy war; an [[acheiropoietos]] image of Christ was carried as a military standard.&lt;ref&gt;Theophanes, ''Chronicle'', 303.12–304.13&lt;br/&gt;* Cameron (1979), 23; Grabar (1984), 37; Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 198&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman army proceeded to Armenia, inflicted a defeat on an army led by a Persian-allied Arab chief, and then won a victory over the Persians under Shahrbaraz.&lt;ref&gt;Theophanes, ''Chronicle'', 304.25–306.7&lt;br/&gt;* Greatrex-Lieu(2002), II, 199&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 624, Heraclius again left Constantinople, with his wife [[Martina (empress)|Martina]] and his two children; after he celebrated [[Easter]] in Nicomedia on April 15, he campaigned in the Caucasus, winning a series of victories in Azerbaijan and Armenia against Khosrau and his generals Shahrbaraz, Shahin and Shahraplakan.&lt;ref&gt;Theophanes, ''Chronicle'', 307.19–308.25&lt;br/&gt;* Greatrex-Lieu (2002), II, 202–205&lt;/ref&gt; In 626 the Avars, Slavs and a Persian army commanded by Shahrbaraz [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|besieged Constantinople]], but the it ended in failure (the victory was attributed to the icons of the Virgin which were led in procession by Sergius about the walls of the city&lt;ref&gt;Cameron (1979), 5–6, 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;), while a second Persian army under Shahin suffered another crushing defeat at the hands of Heraclius' brother Theodore.

With the Persian war effort disintegrating, Heraclius was able to bring the [[Gokturks]] of the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]] into the war against the Sasanian in the Caucasus (see [[Third Perso-Turkic War]]). Late in 627 he launched a winter offensive into Mesopotamia, where, despite the desertion of his Turkish allies, he defeated the Persians under [[Rhahzadh]] at the [[Battle of Nineveh (627)|Battle of Nineveh]]. Continuing south along the Tigris, he sacked Khosrau's great palace at Dastagird and was only prevented from attacking Ctesiphon by the destruction of the bridges on the Nahrawan Canal. Discredited by this series of disasters, Khosrau was overthrown and killed in a coup led by his son [[Kavadh II]], who at once sued for peace, agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territories. In 629 Heraclius restored the [[True Cross]] to [[Jerusalem]] in a majestic ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Haldon (1997), 46; Baynes (1912), ''passim''; Speck (1984), 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{See also|Fall of the Sasanian Empire|Muslim conquests}}
The devastating impact of this last war, added to the cumulative effects of a century of almost continuous conflict, left both empires crippled. When Kavadh II died only months after coming to the throne, Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and [[Sasanian civil war of 628-632|civil war]]. The Sasanians were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation from Khosrau II's campaigns, religious unrest, rigid social stratification, and the increasing power of the provincial landholders. The Roman Empire was even more severely affected, with its financial reserves exhausted by the war, the Balkans now largely in the hands of the Slavs, Anatolia devastated by repeated Persian invasions, and the empire's hold on Syria, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Egypt loosened by many years of Persian occupation. Neither empire was given any chance to recover, as within a few years they were struck by the onslaught of the [[Arabs]], newly united by [[Islam]]. The Sasanian Empire rapidly succumbed to these attacks and was [[Islamic conquest of Persia|completely destroyed]]. During the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]], the exhausted Roman Empire's recently regained southern provinces were also lost during the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]], reducing the empire to a territorial rump consisting of Anatolia and a scatter of islands and footholds in the Balkans and [[Italy]]. These remaining lands were thoroughly impoverished by [[History of Islam in southern Italy|frequent attacks]], marking the transition from classical urban civilization to a more rural, medieval form of society. However, unlike Persia the Roman Empire (in its medieval form usually termed the [[Byzantine Empire]]) ultimately survived the Arab assault, holding onto its residual territories and repulsing two [[Sieges of Constantinople|Arab sieges]] of its capital Constantinople in [[Siege of Constantinople (674)|674]] and [[Siege of Constantinople (718)|718]].

'''CodeCon''' was an annual conference for software [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]] and technology enthusiasts, held every year between 2002 and 2009. CodeCon was not intended to be a [[computer security conference]], but a conference with a focus on software developers doing presentations of technologies, as computer programs, rather than products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Information Security News - CodeCon 2009 Call for Presentations |url= http://seclists.org/isn/2009/Jan/0024.html | date= Jan 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Bram Cohen]] and [[Len Sassaman]] are credited with devising and organizing the first conference at the [[DNA Lounge]] in [[San Francisco, California]] in 2002. The conference was the result of discussion on building a small, programmer-focused convention.

==Early life==
Monn was born and raised in [[Fayetteville, Pennsylvania|Fayetteville]], Pennsylvania as one of six children. As a child, he showed an early interest in fashion design with hopes of attending the [[Parsons School of Design]]. In 1981 at age 18, Monn earned a job at Butte Knit, a clothing factory in his town that was a part of the Jonathan Logan Corporation. This job soon led him to New York City where he rented a studio apartment near [[Mindy Grossman]]'s. While in New York, Monn took up interior decorating for himself and his friends (including Grossman).&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haute"/&gt;

==Career==
Prior to beginning his event and interior design career, Monn worked in the jewelry business for 12 years. In 2003, Gayfryd Steinberg hired Monn as the event planner and designer for the Library Lions Gala at the New York Public Library's main campus.

{{italic title}}
'''''Dunsinane''''' is a 2010 play by [[David Greig (dramatist)|David Greig]].  It premiered in a [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production at the [[Hampstead Theatre]] from 10 February to 6 March 2010, directed by RSC Associate Director Roxana Silbert and with leads including [[Siobhan Redmond]] and [[Jonny Phillips (actor)|Jonny Phillips]].

Its narrative is formed by the events following the defeat of [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] by [[Malcolm (Macbeth)|Malcolm]] and an English army in the [[Dunsinane Hill|Battle of Dunsinane]] at the end of [[William Shakespeare]]’s play ''[[Macbeth]]''. In Greig’s version, Lady Macbeth is known as [[Gruoch of Scotland|Gruach]]. Having outlived her second husband Macbeth, after she had Macbeth kill her first husband, Gruach continued to enforce the Moray claim to the throne via herself and her son by her first marriage. The playwright parallels the attempted [[State-building|nation-building]] by the English leader [[Siward, Earl of Northumbria|Siward]] and the continued bloodshed against the English occupying forces with contemporary events in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]].{{Sfn|Billington|2010}} He also includes the Shakespearean characters MacDuff and Malcolm, as well as introducing new characters such as Siward’s English subordinate Lord Egham and a chorus of English soldiers.

A radio adaptation premiered on [[BBC Radio 3]] directed by Roxana Silbert and with original songs and music composed by [[Nick Powell (musician/composer)|Nick Powell]] on 30 January 2011. The cast included:{{Sfn|BBC Radio 3|2011}}

'''Eastwind''' was a music festival held in 2008 which was planned to be held annually in [[India]] garnering participation from all the major bands and artists in the country. The criterion was Original Contemporary Music and artists performed over three days and through parallel stages from morning till night. 

==The festival==
The recent years (since 2000) have seen increased recognition, visibility and surge in popularity of contemporary original music in India. In spite of that, the world’s perception of Indian music is still subjected to stereotypes, typically Bollywood.

New Delhi plays host to a large number of the nation’s most popular live acts. With Indian bands and their music getting popular and bands being invited to perform abroad, Eastwind creates a single-point showcase that recognises and presents this talent as an entertainment experience.

The idea of a large-scale music festival in India was pathbreaking and the participation of the most popular bands in the country was the main crowd-pulling element of the festival. Prospect Advisory &amp; Management, who visualized and created this festival, were so swamped with requests for participation that they even had to postpone the first event in order to get through all the demos and applications. 

The second edition was postponed from October 2009 to January 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =Gandhi | first =Vidhi | title =Eastwind Festival Rescheduled | work =Magazine | publisher =Chordvine | date =7 October 2009 | url =http://chordvine.com/dispatches/eastwind-festival-rescheduled | accessdate =2010-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before being cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =Ravi | first =Arjun S. | title =Eastwind Festival Cancelled | publisher =Indecision | date = | url =http://www.indiecision.com/2010/01/05/eastwind-festival-cancelled/ | accessdate =2010-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to official estimates in India, 10,136 people were killed and hundreds of thousands made homeless when a [[tsunami]] triggered by the '''[[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]''' near the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Sumatra]] struck the southern coast on 26 December 2004. The earthquake registered 9.1–9.3 [[Moment magnitude scale|M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;]] and was the largest in five decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnitude 9.1 – OFF THE WEST COAST OF NORTHERN SUMATRA |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2004/us2004slav/ |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=26 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901204211/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2004/us2004slav/ |archivedate=1 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by strong aftershocks&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/Quakes/ussmax.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103084926/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/Quakes/ussmax.htm |date=3 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. The death toll of the earthquake was 1,500 people.

This disaster affected a total of fourteen regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theatlantic.com|title = Ten Years Since the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami|last = Taylor|first = Alan|date = 2014-12-26|work = |access-date = 2016-02-01|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] comprise 572 islands (land masses at low and high tide), of which 38 are inhabited by people from the mainland and indigenous tribes. The islands were just north of the earthquake [[epicentre]], and the tsunami reached a height of {{convert|15|m}} in the southern Nicobar Islands. The official death toll was 1,310, with about 5,600 missing. The unofficial death toll (including those missing and presumed dead) was estimated at about 7,000. This ocean earthquake goes down in history as the deadliest of all time. It took the lives of over 230,000 victims throughout the fourteen regions and wounded more than double this number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ibtimes.co.uk|title = 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami: Facts about the Boxing Day disaster|last = Osbourne|first = Hannah|date = 2014-12-22|work = |access-date = 2016-02-01|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Great Nicobar]] and [[Car Nicobar]] islands were the worst hit among all the islands because of their proximity to the quake and relatively flat terrain. [[Aftershock]]s rocked the area,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newkerala.com/news-daily/news/features.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=55804]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306181624/http://www.newkerala.com/news-daily/news/features.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=55804 |date=6 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Car Nicobar, 111 [[Indian Air Force]] personnel and their family members were washed away when the tsunami severely damaged their air base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newkerala.com/news-daily/news/features.php?action=fullnews&amp;amp;id=50910] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306181624/http://www.newkerala.com/news-daily/news/features.php?action=fullnews&amp;amp;id=50910 |date=6 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Thomas Cathedral (also known as the ''John Richardson church'' after John Richardson, a [[missionary]] and [[member of parliament]]) was washed away. The church, established in 1930 was one of the oldest and prominent churches in the region. A [[cricket]] stadium named after John Richardson and a statue dedicated to him were also washed away.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Most of the population of the [[Andaman Islands]] are people from the mainland, primarily [[West Bengal]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. The natives of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are endangered tribal groups, such as the [[Jarawa (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]], [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]], [[Shompen people|Shompen]], [[Onge people|Onge]] and the [[Great Andamanese]]. They are [[anthropology|anthropologically]]-significant as some of the world's most primitive tribes. Most have maintained their lifestyle for centuries, and government policy is one of non-interference. Most of the native islanders reportedly survived the tsunami because they live on higher ground or far from the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/12/31/stories/2004123106661100.htm |title=National : All primitive tribes safe |publisher=The Hindu |date=31 December 2004 |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Onge people|Onge]] (with a 2001 census population of 96), [[Jarawa (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]] (240), [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]] (39) and [[Great Andamanese]] (43) were reached by survey teams.

Surveys were conducted on the [[Shompen people|Shompen]] (2001 census count of 398) located on Great Nicobar island.

India's only active volcano, Barren 1 (on [[Barren Island (Andaman Islands)|Barren Island]] {{convert|135|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Port Blair]]), erupted on 30 December due to increased seismic activity. The population was evacuated, and there were no casualties. Indira Point (6°45’10″N and 93°49’36″E), the southernmost point of the Great Nicobar Island and India itself, subsided {{convert|4.25|m}} in the tsunami and its lighthouse was damaged.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indira-Point-falls-off-map/articleshow/975380.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expo for Design, Innovation &amp; Technology''' ('''EDIT''') is a 10-day festival launched by the [[Design Exchange]] (DX) in partnership with the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP). It is also supported by the [[Government of Ontario]] and its Ontario150 Program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario150/ Ontario 150]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival has received a $1.75 million investment from the Government of Ontario in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://torontoguardian.com/2017/05/edit-design-exchange/ A Game-Changing Festival of Innovation Hits Toronto this Fall]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival focusses on design, innovation and technology solutions and highlights the potential that the design industry has to solve issues on a global scale. The first annual festival took place in Toronto from September 28 to October 8, 2017 with a capacity of approximately 100,000 visitors.

The overall theme to EDIT was "Prosperity For All". It was inspired by the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Global Goals for Sustainable Development. The theme was portrayed through an art installation by designer Bruce Man, so cofounded Massive Change Network. It featured large black and white images of global conflict like pollution, genocide, and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/canada-makes-international-design-news-with-launch-of-edit-expo-for-design-innovation--technology-621214063.html|title=Canada Makes International Design News with Launch of EDIT: Expo for Design, Innovation &amp; Technology|website=www.newswire.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics criticized the main character's unlikeability, but praised Robertson's portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/reviews/girlboss-review-nasty-gal-sophia-amoruso-britt-robertson-1202028614/|title=TV Review: 'Girlboss' on Netflix|first=Sonia|last=Saraiya|date=April 17, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/girlboss-held-back-smudged-resume-253553|title=Girlboss held back by a smudged résumé|first=Esther|last=Zuckerman|publisher=|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2017/04/12/girlboss-netflix-review-britt-robertson-millennials/|title='Girlboss': Yet another show about an entitled millennial, blerg|first=Saba|last=Hamedy|website=Mashable|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics were divided as to whether the show presented a feminist message.

In [[ancient Greece]], a '''hecatomb''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|k|ə|t|uː|m}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|k|ə|t|oʊ|m}}; {{lang-grc|ἑκατόμβη}} ''hekatómbē'') was a sacrifice to the gods of 100 cattle (''hekaton'' = one hundred, ''bous'' = bull). In practice, as few as 12 could make up a hecatomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Peter|title=Homer's Odyssey : a companion to the English translation of Richmond Lattimore|date=1988|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|location=Bristol|isbn=1853990388|page=5|edition=[Repr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although originally the sacrifice of a hundred oxen in the religious ceremonies of the Greeks and Romans; later "hecatomb" came to describe a large number of any kind of animals devoted for sacrifice. Figuratively, "hecatomb" is used to describe the sacrifice or destruction by fire, tempest, disease or the sword of any large number of persons or animals; and also of the wholesale destruction of inanimate objects, and even of mental and moral attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Hecatomb |volume=13 |page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece==
Hecatombs were offered to Greek gods [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Apollo]], during special religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://dagr.univ-tlse2.fr/sdx/dagr/feuilleter.xsp?tome=3&amp;partie=1&amp;numPage=57&amp;nomEntree=HEKATOMBAIA Le Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines de Daremberg et Saglio (consultation de l'ensemble du corpus)]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], a hecatomb was also offered to [[Zeus]] at Olympia. 

In the [[Iliad]] hecatombs are described formulaically.  The following is one instance, from [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s translation:

{{quote|[T]hey arranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the altar of the god. They washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle over the victims [cattle], while [the priest] lifted up his hands and prayed aloud on their behalf.

...

When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of the victims (Cattle) and killed and [[flaying|flayed]] them. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them, and then [the priest] laid them on the wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When the thigh-bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon the spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off: then, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water and handed it round, after giving every man his drink-offering.

Thus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning him and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in their voices[.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Homer |translator-last=Butler |translator-first=Samuel |translator-link=Samuel Butler (novelist) |year=1898 |chapter=[[s:The Iliad of Homer (Butler)/Book 1|Book 1]] (428–450)|title=[[s:The Iliad (Butler)|The Iliad]] |pages=12–13}}

In January 2015, Donald Trump chose Hicks, who was 26 years old at the time, for the role of [[press secretary]] for his potential presidential campaign.&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/inside-the-donald-trump-presidential-campaign.html |title=Operation Trump: Inside the Most Unorthodox Campaign in Political History |last=Sherman |first=Gabriel |authorlink=Gabriel Sherman |date=April 3, 2016 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=June 20, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622091418/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/inside-the-donald-trump-presidential-campaign.html |archivedate=June 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tucker |first=Reed |date=September 25, 2015 |url=https://nypost.com/2015/09/25/meet-trumps-26-year-old-mystery-woman/ |title=Meet Trump's 26-year-old mystery woman |work=[[New York Post]] |accessdate=June 20, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625063355/http://nypost.com/2015/09/25/meet-trumps-26-year-old-mystery-woman/ |archivedate=June 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump summoned her to his office and, as she tells it, "Mr. Trump looked at me and said, 'I'm thinking about running for president, and you're going to be my press secretary.{{'"}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; Until that time, she had never worked in politics or volunteered on a campaign.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; After Trump's first primary victories, Hicks was asked to choose between staying with the Trump Organization or working on the campaign full-time. She initially decided to leave the campaign, but Trump convinced her to remain and she stayed on as press secretary.&lt;ref name="GQ" /&gt;

During the campaign, she played the role of gatekeeper to press members who wanted to speak with Trump, handling over 250 requests a day, and deciding which reporters would be allowed to speak with him.&lt;ref name="cosmo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; Hicks also took dictation from Trump for his [[Twitter|tweets]], and then sent the text to another person in the Trump organization who sent the tweets from Trump's official account.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yahoo.com/celebrity/10-things-know-hope-hicks-152314456.html "14 Things to Know About Hope Hicks, Donald Trump's 27-Year-Old Former Model Press Secretary",] [[Yahoo.com]]

On December 22, 2016, it was announced that Hicks would become part of the Trump Administration, in the newly created position of the [[White House Director of Strategic Communications]]. In January 2017, Hicks was included on the [[Forbes 30 Under 30|''Forbes'' 30 Under 30]] list, having "served as a one-woman press team for Trump's historic presidential campaign".&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web |title=Forbes 30 Under 30 |url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/fjle45eeelm/hope-hicks-28/ |website=Forbes |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106030349/http://www.forbes.com/pictures/fjle45eeelm/hope-hicks-28/ |archivedate=January 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 16, 2017, she was made the interim [[White House Communications Director]] (the last Director having been [[Anthony Scaramucci]]). ''Politico'' labelled her the "Untouchable Hope Hicks", as she was considered one of the few White House officials whose job was safe, and one of only two White House communications officials Scaramucci had announced were definitely staying when he was first hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/08/hope-hicks-donald-trump-ivanka-melania-relationship-photos-communications-director-married-experience/ |title=Hope Hicks &amp; Donald Trump: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know |publisher=Heavy |date=August 16, 2017 |first=Jessica |last=McBride |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816160807/http://heavy.com/news/2017/08/hope-hicks-donald-trump-ivanka-melania-relationship-photos-communications-director-married-experience/ |archivedate=August 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed permanent White House Communications Director on September 12, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/hope-hicks-named-white-house-communications-director-after-assuming-role-on-interim-basis-1505231198 |title=Hope Hicks Named Permanent White House Communications Director |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 12, 2017 |first=Rebecca |last=Ballhaus |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912163250/https://www.wsj.com/articles/hope-hicks-named-white-house-communications-director-after-assuming-role-on-interim-basis-1505231198 |archivedate=September 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2018, Hicks gave nine hours of closed-door testimony to the House Intelligence Committee. She acknowledged that she sometimes had to tell "white lies" in her work as communications director, but refused to answer any questions about her tenure in the White House.&lt;ref name="cnnWhiteLies"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/26/politics/hope-hicks-house-intelligence-committee/index.html |title=Hicks acknowledges white lies, but won't talk White House in testimony |last1=Raju |first1=Manu |last2=Herb |first2=Jeremy |date=February 28, 2018 |work=CNN |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day the White House confirmed to ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Hicks planned to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/us/politics/hope-hicks-resign-communications-director.html |title=Hope Hicks to Resign as White House Communications Director |last=Haberman |first=Maggie |date=February 28, 2018 |work=The New York Times|access-date=February 28, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to "multiple sources", she had been planning to resign for months, and her announcement was unrelated to the events of the preceding 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hope-hicks-trump-aide-is-resigning-2018-2 |title=Hope Hicks, one of Trump's closest confidants and longest-tenured aide, is resigning |last=Smith |first=Allan |date=February 28, 2018 |work=Business Insider |accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She officially resigned on March 29, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/politics/hope-hicks-white-house.html |title=Hope Hicks is Gone, and It's Not Clear Who Can Replace Her |last=Rogers |first=Katie |date=March 29, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=March 30, 2018 |last2=Haberman |first2=Maggie |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hicks and her sister lived in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], but she split her time between an apartment there and an apartment in Manhattan. When Trump was elected, she moved to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Hope &amp; Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;"[https://www.yahoo.com/news/hope-hicks-responsible-important-line-201814586.html Hope Hicks Was Responsible for an Important Line in the President's Speech] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728145239/https://www.yahoo.com/news/hope-hicks-responsible-important-line-201814586.html |date=July 28, 2017 }}".

'''Information good''' in [[economics]] and [[law]] is a type [[commodity]] whose market value is derived from [[information]] it contains. Examples include [[Compact Disc|CD]]s containing pieces of music, [[DVD]]s containing movie content, and books containing short stories. Information goods are in contrast to material goods such as clothes, food, and cars. These can exist in either [[Digitizing|digitized form]] or [[Analog recording|analog format]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/japan/|title=Markets for Information Goods|website=people.ischool.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In information goods, the valuable part is a pattern in which the material is arranged including the arrangement of ink on paper or a series of information on a compact disc. Those patterns might be either directly consumed through reading, viewing, or may be used to operate other devices such as a cassette player or a computer. The device, in turn, may produce some consumable pattern of information (such as visual, sound, or text). 

== Economic theory ==
In [[economics]], information plays a double role. On one side, [[perfect information]] is a key requirement of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. Here, information is understood to be instantly available for everybody at no cost and fully complete. However, actual markets often depend on information as a commodity, hence information goods. Here, information is understood to be potentially restricted in terms of access, cost, availability, and completeness.

Economic theory faces the problem of constantly dealing with two contradictory concepts of information at the same time. If efficiency is the dominant aspect of analyses, it is likely that [[commodification]] is considered to be harmful. If incentive for creation is the dominant aspect of analyses, the protection of the creator is then likely to be dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. Shamans, Software, and Spleens: Law and the Construction of the Information Society. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market failure==
A consumer may face [[uncertainty]] and not be able to assess accurately and reliably the utility of some information goods, such as novels, movies, and newspapers, before consumption of the goods. This is a peculiar property of information goods whereby the process of evaluating utility may require the very process of consumption. This uncertainty is a type of [[market failure]] known as the [[The Market for Lemons|lemon problem]] and is not unique to information goods. 

Information goods may interact on the basis of [[artificial scarcity]]. Some information goods can be reproduced and distributed relatively inexpensively. An example would be copying recorded music from radio, cassette player, or CD player to a tape or computer hard disc. 

Information goods are also not consumed by the act of copying. On this basis, some argue that information should be provided without cost and limitations to copying.

As digital technologies and digital electronic networks in some countries became very popular, it was very easy to reproduce and widely distribute some information goods. However, due to the difficulty of controlling the copying and distributing activities of people using such technologies, it is often harder for the producer of such goods to prevent illegal distribution of proprietary works. This operates on the principle of economic [[excludability]].

}}'''''Janzen v Platy Enterprises Ltd''''' [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on discrimination. The Court found that sexual harassment was as a form of discrimination based on sex and so was prohibited by the ''Manitoba Human Rights Act''. 

==Background==
During the fall of 1982, Dianna Janzen and Tracy Govereau were both employed as waitresses at Pharos restaurant in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. Tommy Grammas, a cook at the restaurant, began making sexual advances to Janzen. She repeatedly made it clear that the advances were not welcome, nonetheless they continued. When Janzen approached Eleftherois Anastasiadis, the manager of the restaurant, he said, "if it's about Tommy, I can't do anything about it." Eventually, the advances were replaced with uncooperative and threatening behaviour. When Anastasiadis was approached about it he refused to act on it and instead fired the women.

The women sued Platy Enterprises Ltd., the owner of Phraos restaurant, as well as Tommy, under section 6(1) of the ''[[Manitoba Human Rights Act]]'', for violating their right to equal opportunity by firing them because of their sex.

The Manitoba Human Rights Tribunal held that the women had been subject to sexual harassment on the basis of sex and so the restaurant owners were in violation of section 6(1) of the Act. The Court of Queen's Bench upheld the decision.

The [[Manitoba Court of Appeal]] overturned the Court of Queen's Bench. The court found that sexual harassment was not considered discrimination on the basis of sex and that the employer could not be held vicariously liable of the conduct of the employee.

==Ruling of the Court==
Chief Justice Dickson, writing for a unanimous Court, held that the restaurant's conduct did constitute discrimination on the basis of sex. Dickson rejected the Court of Appeal's ruling that the harassment was not based on sex because not all female employees were targeted. He stated that discrimination on the basis of sex is where there is a "practice or attitude which had the effect of limiting the conditions of employment of, or the employment opportunities available to, employees on the basis of a characteristic related to gender."

'''''La Tomatina''''' ({{IPA-es|la tomaˈtina|va}}) is a [[festival]] that is held in the [[Valencian Community|Valencian]] town of [[Buñol]], in the East of Spain {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} from the Mediterranean, in which participants throw [[tomato]]es and get involved in a tomato fight purely for entertainment purposes. Since 1945 it has been held on the last Wednesday of August, during a week of festivities in Buñol.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:La Tomatina (25.08.2010) - Spain, Buñol 21.jpg|thumb|La Tomatina 25-08-2010]]
It started the last Wednesday of August in 1945 when some young people spent the time in the town square to attend the Giants and Big-Heads figures parade. The young boys decided to take part in a parade with musicians, Giants and Big-Heads figures. The energy of jovialities caused one participant's big head to fall off. The participant flew into a fit of rage, began hitting everything in his path. There was a market stall of vegetable that fell victim to the fury of the crowd. People started to pelt each other with tomatoes until the local forces ended that fruit battle. 

The following year, some young people engaged in a pre-planned quarrel and brought their own tomatoes from home. Although the police broke it up, this began the early tradition. In the following years, the young boys' example had unwittingly made history.

La Tomatina was banned in the early 50s, however this did not stop the participants who were arrested. But the people protested the prohibition and the festivity was again allowed with more participants and increased passions. The festivity was again cancelled till 1957 when, as a sign of protest, the tomato burial was held. It was a demonstration in which the residents carried a coffin with a huge tomato inside. The parade was accompanied by a music band which played funeral marches. The protest was successful. La Tomatina Festival was finally permitted and became an official festival. 

As a result of the report of Javier Basilio,  a broadcaster from the Spanish television program called ''Informe Semanal'', the festivity started to be known throughout the rest of Spain. Since then, the number of participants increased year after year as well as the excitement about La Tomatina Festival. In 2002, La Tomatina of Buñol was declared Festivity of International Tourist Interest by the Secretary Department of Tourism due to its success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latomatina.info/en/la-tomatina/|title=La Tomatina – Página oficial|last=Studio|first=Socarrat|website=latomatina.info|language=es|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Two men preparing greasy pole for La Tomatina festival.jpg|right|thumb|Preparing the "palo jabón".]]
[[File:Arrojando tomates desde un camión - La Tomatina 2010.jpg|thumb|Throwing tomatoes from a truck.]]

Usually the fight lasts for about two hours, after which the town square is covered with tomato debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rte.ie/lifestyle/travel/features/2009/0626/141194-latomatina/ | title=La Tomatina | publisher=RTE | author=Mullins, Deirdre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire trucks then hose down the streets and participants often use hoses that locals provide to remove the tomatoes from their bodies. Some participants go to the “[[Los Peñones]]” pool to wash. The [[citric acid]] in the tomatoes leads to the washed surfaces in the town becoming very clean.&lt;ref name="losangeles"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-tomatina-food-fight-spain-20000-people-130-tons-tomatoes-20130828-story.html | title=La Tomatina festival: 20,000 people, 130 tons of tomatoes, 1 big mess | publisher=''The Los Angeles Times'' | date=August 28, 2013 | author=Harris, Jenn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thetasteofspain.com/spanish-fiestas/la-tomatina/ | title=La Tomatina | publisher=The Taste of Spain|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013 participation in the event has been restricted to the holders of paid tickets. In 2015, it was estimated that almost {{gaps|145|000}} kg of tomatoes were thrown.&lt;ref name="losangeles"/&gt;

==Rules of the festival==

The city council follows a short list of instructions for the safety of the participants and the festival:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rules of Tomatina Festival|url=http://latomatina.info/en/la-tomatina/#reglas|publisher=Tomatina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Do not throw bottles or hard objects
# Do not tear or throw t-shirts
# Squash tomatoes before throwing them to avoid hurting others
# Keep a safe distance from trucks
# Stop throwing tomatoes after the second starter pistol shot
# Follow the directions of security staff

==In other countries==

* Since 1982, the town of [[Twin Lakes, Lake County, Colorado]] has held a tomato fight called the "[[Colorado Texas Tomato War]]," in which [[Texas|Texans]] and [[Colorado|Coloradans]] square off. The Coloradans also attempt to overtake the Texans' straw [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]] effigy, generally succeeding.
* Since 2004 the Colombian town of [[Sutamarchán]] holds a similar event on 15 June when a surplus of tomatoes is harvested.&lt;ref name="Galván2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Galván|first=Javier A.|title=They Do What?

* In Costa Rica the town of San José de Trojas ([[Valverde Vega Canton]]) celebrates a Tomatina during the local Tomato Fair.&lt;ref name="odd"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oddculture.com/la-tomatina-tomato-festival-inspires-tomato-battle-in-usa/ | title=La Tomatina Tomato Festival Inspires Tomato Battle In USA | publisher=Odd Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the town of [[Dongguan]] in southern [[Guangdong]] province in China, a tomato fight is held on October 19, during which they use up to 15 tons of tomatoes.&lt;ref name="odd"/&gt;
* The City of [[Reno, Nevada]] in the United States also has an annual hour-long tomato fight that started in 2009. The event seems to take place on the last Sunday of August and is organized by the [[American Cancer Society]]. Organizers named the festival La Tomatina, and give full credit for the idea to the Spanish festival.&lt;ref name="Galván2014"/&gt;
* In the Indian state of [[Karnataka]], the [[Karnataka Government]] banned the hosting of such a Tomatina event in [[Bangalore]] and [[Mysore]], after private organizers tried to organize one. Chief Minister [[D.V. Sadananda Gowda]] is quoted as saying: "In the name of 'La Tomatina' festival, permission should not be granted to waste tomatoes". A similar event planned in [[Delhi]] was cancelled after it received negative response from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangalore's Tomatina festival cancelled|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cities/bangalore-s-tomatina-festival-cancelled-134173|publisher=[[NDTV 24x7]] |accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arabian Peninsula]] is a [[peninsula]] between the [[Red Sea]], the [[Arabian Sea]], and the [[Persian Gulf]]. There are 59&amp;nbsp;known [[tropical cyclone]]s that affected the peninsula, primarily [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]. For convenience, storms are included that affected the Yemeni island of [[Socotra]]. Most of the tropical cyclones originated in the Arabian Sea, the portion of the [[Indian Ocean]] north of the equator and west of [[India]]. The remainder formed in the [[Bay of Bengal]] off India's east coast. Collectively, the 57&amp;nbsp;storms have caused at least [[United States dollar|US$]]5.7&amp;nbsp;billion in damage and 1,693&amp;nbsp;deaths. The strongest and most damaging cyclone was [[Cyclone Gonu]], which caused [[United states dollar|US$]]4&amp;nbsp;billion in damage and 50&amp;nbsp;fatalities when it struck Oman in 2007. Tropical cyclone damage in the Arabian Peninsula is chiefly due to flooding.

==Climatology==
Within the [[Indian Ocean]] north of the [[equator]], [[tropical cyclone]]s are tracked by the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), which is the officially designated [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|title=Latest Advisories on Current Tropical Cyclones Hurricanes Typhoons|accessdate=January 14, 2016|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/Advisories-RSMCs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American-based [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) also tracks storms in the basin on an unofficial basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=January 14, 2016|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/JTWC/frequently-asked-questions-1/frequently-asked-questions|date=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arabian Sea]], which borders the Arabian Peninsula, typically spawns tropical cyclones in the southeastern portion of the body of water, offshore of western India.&lt;ref name="mem"/&gt; About 48.5% of cyclones dissipate without making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], or moving ashore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landfall|publisher=India Meteorological Department|accessdate=January 14, 2016|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=202&amp;lang=en|date=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around one in three storms move toward the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="mem"/&gt; However, storms do not form in the western Arabian Sea because of cool [[sea surface temperature]]s (the result of strong winds from the [[monsoon]]),&lt;ref name="mem"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genesis|publisher=India Meteorological Department|accessdate=January 14, 2016|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=199&amp;lang=en|date=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as dry air from the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="rw1115"/&gt;

The sultanate of Oman, located on the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, regularly receives the impacts of tropical cyclones due to its long coastline along the Arabian Sea.&lt;ref name="wmoman"/&gt; On average, storms strike Oman once every three years, mostly between [[Masirah Island]] and [[Salalah]], and usually before June or after October.&lt;ref name="mem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anal"/&gt; From 1943 to 1967, tropical cyclones accounted for about 25% of Salalah's overall rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|series=Global tropical/extratropical cyclone climatic atlas|title=Hurricane TC-18-77, 9–13 June|year=1996|work=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 16, 2016|url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4274123/FID218/DATA/TROPIC/NI_NAR/1977_2.NAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; About once every five years, a storm affects the [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar region]] of southern Oman, and Oman's capital of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] about once every ten years in.&lt;ref name="anal"/&gt; Between 1890 and 1996, 36&amp;nbsp;storms struck Oman, although some landfalling storms might be excluded from the historical record due to the lack of population centers.&lt;ref name="mem"/&gt; In addition, storm intensities at landfall have only been accurately known since around 1979,&lt;ref name="wmoman"/&gt; and reliable record keeping began around 1970.

The '''Missouri State Fair''' is the [[state fair]] for the state of [[Missouri]], which has operated since 1901 in [[Sedalia, Missouri]]. It includes daily concerts, exhibits and competitions of animals, homemade crafts, shows, and many food/lemonade stands, and it only lasts 11 days. Its most famous event is the mule show, which has run since its inception. The fairgrounds are located at 2503 W 16th Street on the southwest side of the city at the intersection of West 16th Street (State Highway Y) and South Limit Avenue ([[U.S. Route 65|U.S. Highway 65]]).

In 2015, the Missouri State Fair had an attendance of about 350,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.missourinet.com/2016/08/27/2016-missouri-state-fair-includes-two-record-attendance-days/ record&lt;/ref&gt; It has won numerous first-place and other awards at the annual conference of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions (IAFE), especially for its promotion of agricultural exhibitors.

==History==
In 1897, N. H. Gentry of Sedalia persuaded the Missouri Swine Breeders Association to request the Missouri [[Legislature|General Assembly]] to establish a state fair.  In 1899 a resolution for the fair was introduced by C.E. Clark.
[[File:At the Fair in Sedalia.jpg|right|thumb|At the Missouri State Fair, 2005]]
The state considered locating the fair in [[Centralia, Missouri|Centralia]], [[Chillicothe, Missouri|Chillicothe]], [[Marshall, Missouri|Marshall]], [[Mexico, Missouri|Mexico]], [[Moberly, Missouri|Moberly]] and Sedalia. Cities made offers on the amounts of land they would commit to the fair.

After ten ballots, Sedalia received the majority vote; it had bid {{convert|150|acre|km2}}, the most amount of land of any city to be devoted to the fairgrounds.  The Van Riper family, who had set land aside for the location of the [[Missouri State Capitol]] in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]], also donated the site in Sedalia.

The first Missouri State Fair was held September 9–13 in 1901.  One of the most distinctive aspects of the early fairs was the "white city": the {{convert|24|acre|m2}} of tents, each for rent by exhibitors.

[[Odessa Ice Cream Company Building|Odessa Ice Cream]] was the official ice cream at the Missouri State Fair in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="DNR"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/96001065.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Odessa Ice Cream Company Building | accessdate = 2017-01-01| author=Cydney E. Millstein |format = PDF| date=June 1996|publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources}} (includes 8 photographs from 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

The Missouri State Fairgrounds are now used year-round and generate revenue in every season, for more than 350 days out of the available 365.  The fairgrounds hosted the [[Ozark Music Festival]] July 19–21, 1974, with an  estimated crowd of 350,000 people. Off-season usage includes music concerts, camper rallies, livestock shows, organized athletic leagues and tournaments, auto races, craft shows, and youth rallies.

The '''Missouri State Fairgrounds Historic District''' was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;  It encompasses 47 contributing buildings, 5 contributing sites, 7 contributing structures, and 7 contributing objects.  The district developed between 1901 and 1941, and includes representative examples of [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco]], [[Mission Revival architecture|Mission Revival]], and [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] architecture.  They include several red brick exposition halls and animal barns, concrete [[drinking fountain]]s constructed by [[Works Progress Administration]], and concession buildings.&lt;ref name="DNR1"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/91000853.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Missouri State Fairgrounds Historic District | accessdate = 2017-02-01| author=Roger Maserang and Steven E. Mitchell|format = PDF| date=April 1991|publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources}} (includes 71 photographs from 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009==
In 2009, the Missouri State Fair celebrated its 107th year.  Attendance increased nearly 8 percent, for a total of 337,851 during the fair's run.  The mild summer encouraged high attendance, and families also liked the fair's affordability as a joint event they could enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mostatefair.com/press/PR10062009.htm "Attendance at 2009 State Fair Increases As Missourians Respond to Affordability"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217034745/http://www.mostatefair.com/press/PR10062009.htm |date=2009-12-17 }}, Press Release, 6 Oct 2009, Missouri State Fair, accessed 23 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the year, fair organizers were honored with first-place and other awards at the International Association of Fairs and Expositions (IAFE).  Missouri State Fair Director Mark Wolfe was pleased with the fair's recognition.  First place awards included one for "Overall Program for Competitive Agricultural Exhibitors", an overview of the Fair's entire agricultural program including number of entries, promotional materials and the overall quality of the program.&lt;ref name="mostatefair.com"&gt;[http://www.mostatefair.com/press/PR12102009.htm "Missouri State Fair Receives International Recognition"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 10 Dec 2009, Press Release, Missouri State Fair, accessed 23 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

"This category is among one of the highest honors a fair can receive," said Wolfe. "I am extremely proud to have placed 1st for our continued dedication to showcase agriculture, which is the premise of the Missouri State Fair."&lt;ref name="mostatefair.com"/&gt;

Another first place win was received for the category of "Fair and Sponsor Joint Exhibit Program".  The Fair partnered with [[Monsanto Corporation]] in the first annual [[4-H]] Show-Me [[Robots]] exhibit.&lt;ref name="mostatefair.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28609">In [[economics]], a '''monopsony''' (from Ancient Greek μόνος (''mónos'') "single" + ὀψωνία (''opsōnía'') "purchase") is a [[market structure]] in which a single buyer substantially controls the market as the major purchaser of goods and services offered by many would-be sellers. In the [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] theory of monopsony, a single entity is assumed to have market power over sellers as the only purchaser of a good or service, much in the same manner that a [[monopolist]] can influence the price for its buyers in a [[monopoly]], in which only one seller faces many buyers.

==History==
Monopsony theory was developed by economist [[Joan Robinson]] in her book ''The Economics of Imperfect Competition'' (1933). Economists use the term "monopsony power" in a manner similar to "monopoly power" as a shorthand reference for a scenario in which there is one dominant power in the buying relationship, so that power is able to set prices to maximize profits not subject to competitive constraints. Monopsony power exists when one buyer faces little competition from other buyers for that labor or good, so they are able to set wages and prices for the labor or goods they are buying at a level lower than would be the case in a competitive market. A classic theoretical example is a [[mining town]], where the company that owns the mine is able to set wages low since they face no competition from other employers in hiring workers, because they are the only employer in the town, and geographic isolation or obstacles prevent workers from seeking employment in other locations. Other more current examples may include school districts where teachers have little mobility across districts. In such cases the district faces little competition from other schools in hiring teachers, giving the district increased power when negotiating employment terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/649904], more text.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative terms are [[oligopsony]] or monopsonistic competition.

===Etymology===
The term was first introduced by [[Joan Robinson]] in her influential&lt;ref name=RobinsonAssessments&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Prue|last2=Harcourt|first2=Geoff|authorlink1=Prue Kerr|authorlink2=Geoff Harcourt|year=2002|title=Joan Robinson: Critical Assessments of Leading Economists|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=2–3|isbn=0-415-21743-1|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; book, ''The Economics of Imperfect Competition'', published in 1933.  Robinson credited classics scholar [[Bertrand Hallward]] at [[the University of Cambridge]] with coining the term.&lt;ref name="jep"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/0895330041371240 | title=Retrospectives: How Joan Robinson and B.

==Static monopsony in a labor market==
[[File:Monopsony-static-partial-equilibrium.svg|thumb|300px|right|A monopsonist employer maximizes profits by choosing the employment level ''L'', that equates the marginal revenue product (''MRP'') to the marginal cost ''MC'', at point ''A''. The wage is then determined on the labor supply curve, at point ''M'',  and is equal to ''w''. By contrast, a competitive labor market would reach equilibrium at point ''C'', where labor supply ''S''&amp;nbsp; equals demand.  This would lead to employment ''L'&amp;nbsp;'' and wage ''w'.'']]

The standard textbook monopsony model of a labor market is a static partial equilibrium model with just one employer who pays the same wage to all the workers. The employer faces an upward-sloping ''labor supply curve'' (as generally contrasted with an infinitely elastic labor supply curve), represented by the ''S'' blue curve in the diagram on the right. This curve relates the wage paid, &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, to the level of employment, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;,  and is denoted as an increasing function &lt;math&gt;w(L)&lt;/math&gt;. Total labor costs are given by &lt;math&gt;w(L)\cdot L&lt;/math&gt;.  The firm has a total revenue &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, which increases with &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The firm wants to choose  &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to maximize profits, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, which are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;P(L)=R(L)-w(L)\cdot L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

At the maximum profit &lt;math&gt;P'(L) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, so first-order condition for maximization is

:&lt;math&gt;0=R'(L) - w'(L)\cdot L-w(L)&lt;/math&gt;

where here &lt;math&gt;w'(L)&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;w(L),&lt;/math&gt; implying

:&lt;math&gt;R'(L)=w'(L)\cdot L+w(L).&lt;/math&gt;

The left-hand side of this expression, &lt;math&gt;R'(L)&lt;/math&gt;, is the ''[[marginal revenue product]]'' of labor (roughly, the extra revenue produced by an extra worker) and is represented by the red ''MRP'' curve in the diagram. The right-hand side is the ''marginal cost'' of labor (roughly, the extra cost due to an extra worker) and is represented by the green ''MC'' curve in the diagram. Notably, the marginal cost is ''higher'' than the wage &lt;math&gt;w(L)&lt;/math&gt; paid to the new worker by the amount

:&lt;math&gt;w'(L)L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

This is because the firm has to increase the wage paid to all the workers it already employs whenever it hires an extra worker. In the diagram, this leads to an ''MC'' curve that is ''above'' the labor supply curve ''S''.

The first-order condition for maximum profit is then satisfied at point ''A'' of the diagram, where the ''MC'' and ''MRP''&amp;nbsp; curves intersect. This determines the profit-maximising employment as ''L'' on the horizontal axis. The corresponding wage ''w'' is then obtained from the supply curve, through point ''M''.

The monopsonistic equilibrium at ''M'' can be contrasted with the equilibrium that would obtain under competitive conditions. Suppose a competitor employer entered the market and offered a wage higher than that at ''M''. Then every employee of the first employer would choose instead to work for the competitor. Moreover, the competitor would gain all the former profits of the first employer, minus a less-than-offsetting amount from the wage increase of the first employer's employees, plus profits arising from additional employees who decided to work in the market because of the wage increase. But the first employer would respond by offering an even higher wage, poaching the new rival's employees, and so forth. As a result, a group of perfectly competitive firms would be forced, through [[competition]], to intersection ''C'' rather than ''M''. Just as a [[monopoly]] is thwarted by the competition to win sales, minimizing prices and maximizing output, competition for employees between the employers in this case would maximize both wages and employment.

===Welfare implications===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
[[File:Monopsony-welfare-effects.svg|right|thumb|300px|The grey rectangle is a measure of the amount of economic welfare transferred from the workers to their employer(s) by monopsony power. The yellow triangle shows the ''overall deadweight loss'' inflicted on both groups by the monopsonistic restriction of employment. It is thus a measure of the ''market failure'' caused by monopsony.]]
The lower employment and wages caused by monopsony power have two distinct effects on the economic welfare of the people involved. First, it redistributes welfare away from workers and to their employer(s). Secondly, it reduces the aggregate (or social) welfare enjoyed by both groups taken together, as the employers' net gain is smaller than the loss inflicted on workers.

The diagram on the right illustrates both effects, using the standard approach based on the notion of [[economic surplus]]. According to this notion, the workers' economic surplus (or net gain from the exchange) is given by the area between the ''S'' curve and the horizontal line corresponding to the wage, up to the employment level. Similarly, the employers' surplus is the area between the horizontal line corresponding to the wage and the ''MRP'' curve, up to the employment level. The ''social'' surplus is then the sum of these two areas.

Following such definitions, the grey rectangle, in the diagram, is the part of the competitive social surplus that has been redistributed from the workers to their employer(s) under monopsony. By contrast, the yellow triangle is the part of the competitive social surplus that has been lost by ''both'' parties, as a result of the monopsonistic restriction of employment. This is a net social loss and is called ''[[deadweight loss]]''. It is a measure of the market failure caused by monopsony power, through a wasteful misallocation of resources.

As the diagram suggests, the size of both effects increases with the difference between the marginal revenue product ''MRP'' and the market wage determined on the supply curve ''S''. This difference corresponds to the vertical side of the yellow triangle, and can be expressed as a proportion of the market wage, according to the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;e=\frac{R'(w)-w}{w}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The ratio &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has been called the [[rate of exploitation]], and it can be easily shown that it equals the reciprocal of the elasticity of the labour supply curve faced by the firm. Thus the rate of exploitation is zero under competitive conditions, when this elasticity tends to infinity. Empirical estimates of &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; by various means are a common feature of the applied literature devoted to the measurement of observed monopsony power.

Finally, it is important to notice that, while the gray-area redistribution effect could be reversed by fiscal policy (i.e., taxing employers and transferring the tax revenue to the workers), this is not so for the yellow-area deadweight loss. The market failure can only be addressed in one of two ways: either by breaking up the monopsony through anti-trust intervention, or by regulating the wage policy of firms. The most common kind of regulation is a binding [[minimum wage]] higher than the monopsonistic wage.

===Minimum wage===
[[File:Monopsony-minimum-wage.svg|thumb|300px|right|With a binding minimum wage of ''w{{'}}'&amp;nbsp;'' the marginal cost to the firm becomes the horizontal black ''MC'&amp;nbsp;'' line, and the firm [[Profit maximization|maximises profits]] (which it can do due to a lack of competition) at ''A'' with a higher employment ''L{{'}}'.'' However, in this example, the minimum wage is higher than the competitive one, leading to ''[[involuntary unemployment]]'' equal to the segment ''AB''.]]

A binding minimum wage can be introduced either directly by law or through collective bargaining laws requiring union membership.  While it is generally agreed that minimum wage price floors reduce employment&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epionline.org/wp-content/studies/Neumark_2007.pdf|year=2007|title=Minimum Wage Effects in the Post-welfare Reform Era|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506194217/https://www.epionline.org/wp-content/studies/Neumark_2007.pdf|archivedate=2018-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in the presence of monopsony power within the labor market the effect is reversed and a minimum wage ''could'' increase employment. 

This effect is demonstrated in the diagram on the right.

Here the minimum wage is ''w{{'}}','' higher than the monopsonistic ''w''. Because of the binding effects of minimum wage and the excess supply of labor (as defined by the monopsony status), the marginal cost of labor for the firm becomes constant (the price of hiring an additional worker rather than the increasing cost as labor becomes more scarce)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/02/the_minimum_wag_4.html|title=The Minimum Wage and Monopsony|year=2015|work=The Library of Economics and Liberty|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213195056/http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/02/the_minimum_wag_4.html|archivedate=2018-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  This means that the firm maximizes profit at the intersection of the new marginal cost line (MC' in the diagram) and Marginal Revenue Product line (the additional revenue for selling one more unit)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/02/the_minimum_wag_2.html|title=The Minimum Wage and Monopsony|year=2013|work=The Library of Economics and Liberty|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213021850/http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/02/the_minimum_wag_2.html|archivedate=2018-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  This is the point where it becomes more expensive to produce an additional item than is earned in revenue from selling that item.   

It should be noted that this condition is still inefficient compared to a competitive market.  The line segment represented by A-B shows that there are still workers who would like to find a job, but cannot due to the monopsonistic nature of this industry.  This would represent the unemployment rate for this industry. This illustrates the there will be deadweight loss in a monoposonistic labor environment regardless of minimum wage levels, however a minimum wage law can increase total employment within the industry.  


More generally, a binding minimum wage modifies the form of the supply curve faced by the firm, which becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;w=\begin{cases}w_{min},&amp;\mbox{if }w_{min}\ge\;w(L)\\w(L), &amp;\mbox{if }w_{min}\le\;w(L)\end{cases}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w(L)&lt;/math&gt; is the original supply curve and &lt;math&gt;w_{min}&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum wage. The new curve has thus a horizontal first branch and a kink at the point

:&lt;math&gt; w(L)=w_{min}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

as is shown in the diagram by the kinked black curve ''MC' S'' (the black curve to the right of point B). The resulting equilibria (the profit-maximizing choices that rational companies will make) can then fall into one of three classes according to the value taken by the minimum wage, as shown by the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Profit Maximizing Choice In A Monopsonistic Labor Market Depends Upon The Minimum Wage Level
|-
!
! Minimum Wage
! Resulting Equilibrium
|-
! First Case
| &lt; than monopsony wage
| where the monopsony wage intersects the supply curve (S)
|-
! Second Case
| &gt; monopsony wage &lt;br/&gt; but &lt;br/&gt; ≤ than competitive wage (the intersection of S and MRP)
| at the intersection of the minimum wage and the supply curve (S)
|-
! Third Case
| &gt; competitive wage
| at intersection where minimum wage equals ''MRP''
|}

Yet, even when it is sub-optimal, a minimum wage higher than the monopsonistic rate raises the level of employment anyway. This is a highly remarkable result because it only follows under monopsony. Indeed, under competitive conditions any minimum wage higher than the market rate would actually ''reduce'' employment, according to classical economic models and the consensus of peer-reviewed work&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;. Thus, spotting the effects on employment of newly introduced minimum wage regulations is among the indirect ways economists use to pin down monopsony power in selected labor markets.  This technique was used, for example in a series of studies looking at the American labor market that found monopsonies existed only in several specialized fields such as professional sports and college professors&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/monopsony-in-american-labor-markets/|year=2017|title=Monopsony in American Labor Markets|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319225003/https://eh.net/encyclopedia/monopsony-in-american-labor-markets/|archivedate=2018-03-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dstaiger/Papers/2010/staiger%20spetz%20phibbs%20monopsony%20jole%202010.pdf|year=2010|title=Is There Monopsony in the Labor Market?

===Wage discrimination===
Just like a monopolist, a monopsonistic employer may find that its profits are maximized if it ''discriminates'' prices. In this case this means paying different wages to different groups of workers even if their MRP is the same, with lower wages paid to the workers who have a lower elasticity of supply of their labor to the firm.

Researchers have used this fact to explain at least part of the observed wage differentials whereby [[Equal pay for women|women often earn less than men]], even after controlling for observed productivity differentials. Robinson's original application of monopsony (1938) was developed to explain wage differentials between equally productive women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rlo/696i/Monopsony_Model_Latex.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203115043/http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rlo/696i/Monopsony_Model_Latex.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ransom and Oaxaca (2004) found that women's wage elasticity is lower than that of men for employees at a grocery store chain in Missouri, controlling for other factors typically associated with wage determination.&lt;ref&gt;http://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/bitstream/88435/dsp01nk322d34x/1/540.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ransom and Lambson (2011) found that female teachers are paid less than male teachers due to differences in labor market mobility constraints facing women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econbiz.de/Record/monopsony-mobility-and-sex-differences-in-pay-missouri-school-teachers-ransom-michael/10009267099|title=Monopsony, mobility, and sex differences in pay : Missouri school teachers|year=2011|work=econbiz.de|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203110219/http://www.econbiz.de/Record/monopsony-mobility-and-sex-differences-in-pay-missouri-school-teachers-ransom-michael/10009267099|archivedate=2014-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have argued informally that, while this is so for ''market'' supply, the reverse may somehow be true of the supply to individual firms. In particular, Manning and others have shown that, in the case of the [[Equal Pay Act 1970|UK Equal Pay Act]], implementation has led to higher employment of women. Since the Act was effectively minimum wage legislation for women, this might perhaps be interpreted as a symptom of monopsonistic discrimination.

==Empirical problems==

The simpler explanation of monopsony power in labor markets is barriers to entry on the demand side. Such barriers to entry would result in a limited number of companies competing for labor (oligopsony).  If the hypothesis was generally true, one would expect to find that wages decreased as firm size increased or, more accurately, as industry concentration increased.  However, numerous statistical studies document significant positive correlations between firm or establishment size and wages. These results are often explained as being the result of cross-industry competition.  For example, if there were only one fast food producer, that industry would be very consolidated.  But that company wouldn't be able to drive down wages via monopsonistic power if it were also competing against retail stores, construction, and other jobs utilizing the same labor skill set.  This finding is both intuitive (low-skilled labor can move more fluidly through different industries) and supported by the data which found that monopsony effects are limited to professional sports, and perhaps nursing, fields where skill sets limit moving to comparably paid other industries. &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

However, monopsony power might also be due to circumstances affecting entry of workers on the supply side (like in the referenced case above), directly reducing the elasticity of labor supply to firms. Paramount among these are industry accreditation or licensing fees, regulatory constraints, training or education requirements, and the institutional factors that limit labor mobility between firms, including job protection legislation. 

An alternative that has been suggested as a source of monopsony power is worker preferences over job characteristics. &lt;ref name="ECJ"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0297.00427 | title=Minimum Wages for Ronald McDonald Monopsonies: a Theory of Monopsonistic Competition | author=Bhaskar, V.

Empirical evidence of monopsony power has been relatively limited. In line with the considerations discussed above, but perhaps counter to common intuition, there is no observable monopsony power in low-skilled labor markets in the US.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  Though there has been at least one study finding monopsony power in Indonesia due to barriers to entry in developing countries. &lt;ref name="CU"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://conference.iza.org/conference_files/worldb2011/brummund_p6819.pdf | title=Evidence of Monopsony in the Labor Market of a Developing Country | author=Brummond, Peter | journal=Cornell University | year=2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405025127/http://conference.iza.org/conference_files/worldb2011/brummund_p6819.pdf | archivedate=2018-04-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies expanding their view for monopsony power have found economic and labor mobility in the US precludes any detectable monopsony effects &lt;ref name="ILRR"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246546086_Monopsony_Power_Pay_Structure_and_Training | title=Monopsony Power, Pay Structure and Training | author=Samuel Muehlemann, Paul Ryan, Stefan C.

The '''NBC News Team kidnapping in Syria''' took place in late 2012 inmidst the [[Syrian Civil War]], when US journalist [[Richard Engel]], chief [[foreign correspondent]] of [[NBC News]], with his five-member reporting crew were abducted by armed militants.

Taken hostage on 13 December 2012 near the [[Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing]] when crossing into [[Syria]], Richard Engel and his crew members – Aziz Akyavaş, Ghazi Balkiz, John Kooistra, Ian Rivers and Ammar Cheikh Omar –
was detained in the vicinity of [[Ma'arrat Misrin]] in northern [[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]]. Five days later, the six journalists managed to escape during a firefight at a checkpoint of Islamist [[Ahrar ash-Sham]].

The case was controversial, as upon their release, Engel and his crew blamed a Shiite [[Shabiha]] group of [[Bashar al-Assad|Assad]]-loyalists for the abduction. The narrative was however challenged, and it later turned out that they were most likely abducted by [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA)-aligned [[Syrian opposition|Syrian rebel]] group [[North Idlib Falcons Brigade]]. It also became known that NBC News' investigation team had suspected the Sunni group from the outset, but withheld their intelligence.

== Early coverage ==
The kidnapping was first revealed to the public, when Turkish journalist [[Cüneyt Özdemir]] [[Twitter|tweeted]] about fellow Turkish journalist Aziz Akyavaş having disappeared. Turkish newspaper ''[[Hürriyet]]'' ran a news report on 16 December 2012&lt;ref name=Hurriyet&gt;{{cite web |title=Aziz Akyavaş 4 gündür Suriye’de kayıp |work=[[Hürriyet]] |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/aziz-akyavas-4-gundur-suriye-de-kayip-22171723 |date=16 December 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2015 |language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was picked up by Turkish news channel [[NTV (Turkey)|NTV]], Chinese news agency [[Xinhua]], and U.S. blogs [[Daily Kos]] and [[Breitbart]], amongst others.&lt;ref name=Gawker&gt;{{cite web |author=John Cook |authorlink=John Cook (reporter) |title=Richard Engel is Missing in Syria; NBC News Enforces News Blackout |url=http://gawker.com/5969029/richard-engel-is-missing-in-syria-nbc-news-enforces-news-blackout |work=[[Gawker]] |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== News blackout ===
[[File:NBC News Washington.jpg|thumb|[[NBC News]] Washington Bureau]]

Following the disclosure, NBC News asked every reporter inquiring about the ''Hürriyet'' report to participate in a [[news blackout]]. They also asked Twitter users to take down related tweets.&lt;ref name=Gawker /&gt; U.S. online magazine [[Gawker]], amongst others, broke the news blackout referring to the news being already out in the public. Gawker's author [[John Cook (reporter)|John Cook]] emphasized that – unlike in the case of the 2008 kidnapping of ''New York Times'' reporter [[David Rohde]] – the rationale offered in off-the-record conversations didn't "indicate a specific, or even general, threat to Engel's safety."&lt;ref name=Gawker /&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] emergencies director [[Peter Bouckaert]] criticized the outlets which ran reports ahead of the captives' release. He defended the news blackout as going “against the journalistic instinct to report the news, but in many of these cases [do] save lives.”&lt;ref name=NYT2012&gt;{{cite |author1=[[Brian Stelter]] |author2=Sebnem Arsu |title=Richard Engel of NBC Is Freed in Syria |work=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/business/media/richard-engel-of-nbc-is-released-in-syria.html |date=18 December 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, fellow war correspondent [[Robert Young Pelton]] criticized the news blackout as a "clumsy attempt to cover collective corporate ass and mitigate bad publicity," maintaining that no one could show blackouts help protect captives.&lt;ref name=DailyBeast&gt;{{cite web |author=Jamie Dettmer |title=Richard Engel’s Kidnapping: A Behind the Scenes Look |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/22/richard-engel-s-kidnapping-a-behind-the-scenes-look.html |date=22 December 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and early eyewitness accounts==
[[File:Akyavaş, Engel &amp; Kooistra after release.jpg|thumb|Aziz Akyavaş, Richard Engel and John Kooistra ''{{small|(l.t.r.)}}'' at a news conference in [[Reyhanlı]], Turkey following their escape]]

Following their release on late Monday, 17 December, Engel and his crew returned to [[Turkey]]. NBC immediately published a statement informing about them being "safely out of the country".&lt;ref name=NBC18dec12&gt;{{cite web |author=Mike Brunker |title=Richard Engel and NBC News team freed from captors in Syria |publisher=[[NBC News]] |url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/18/15985279-richard-engel-and-nbc-news-team-freed-from-captors-in-syria  |date=18 December 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Associated Press]] spread an amateur video, that had apparently been posted earlier that week by the hostage-takers on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name=NYT2012 /&gt;

While Aziz Akyavaş spoke at a news conference in Turkey,&lt;ref name=NYT2012 /&gt; Engel, Kooistra and Balkiz had their first appearance on NBC's morning show ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]].'' In his ''Today'' interview, Engel said that while crossing back into Syria, they were captured by around 15 men, who "literally jumped out of the trees and bushes" and dragged them out of their car, killing one of the rebels who accompanied the crew. During their captivity near the village of [[Ma'arrat Misrin]], they remained physically unharmed, but were blindfolded and bound, and were subjected to [[mock execution]]s.&lt;ref name=NBC18dec12 /&gt;

The kidnappers had talked "openly about their loyalty to the government" of Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad|Assad]], and that they wanted to exchange them for four Iranian agents and two Lebanese member of the [[Amal Movement]]. He said he therefore had "a very good idea" about who his captors were: members of the [[Shabiha]] militia, who are loyal to Assad, trained by the Iran's [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guard]] and allied with Lebanon-based [[Hezbollah]] group.&lt;ref name=NBC18dec12 /&gt;

NBC wrote in a statement that Engel and his crew became free when during a relocation, their vehicle ran into a checkpoint of fundamentalist rebel group [[Ahrar al-Sham]], and that during a firefight, "two of the captors were killed, while an unknown number of others escaped.” The rebels then helped escort the crew to the border with Turkey.&lt;ref name=NBC18dec12 /&gt;

===Reactions===
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, [[Susan E. Rice]], wrote on Twitter that she was relieved for Engel and his crew, adding that: "The situation for Syria’s people remains dire. They, too, deserve to be free."&lt;ref name=NYT2012 /&gt;

==Later interviews==
In one of the several interviews of team members with NBC News, producer Ghazi Balkiz recounted the firefight that eventually led to their liberation, was for him the most "nerve-wracking" moment, though being personally subjected to mock executions before. It became clear that the NBC team was initially captured near the [[Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing]], and that five days later, they used the "chaotic minutes" of the firefight to break out of the van and take cover.&lt;ref name=DailyBeast /&gt;

In the April 2013 edition of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Engel recounted his experience in an editorial, "The Hostage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=[[Richard Engel]] |title=The Hostage |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |issue=4 |date=April 2013 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2013/04/richard-engel-kidnapping-syria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early doubts==
While the network and Engel were thought of having followed "a consistent clear-cut narrative on the kidnapping,"  Jamie Dettmer of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' challenged NBC's version only days later. The NBC version, he wrote, "omits much and is at odds with what security sources involved in the freeing of the group say happened," referring to unnamed sources who also claimed the network was trying to present the incident in the best possible light, masking a series of basic security lapses.&lt;ref name=DailyBeast /&gt;

Furthermore, according to Dettmer's unnamed sources, NBC’s security advisers had been convinced that there was at least some involvement of "rogue members of the rebel FSA." NBC's security contractor [[Pilgrims Group]] had already focussed on the area of [[Ma'arrat Misrin]] and urged FSA contacts to set up checkpoints to box the captors in, pointing out that Engel had been supportive of the [[Syrian Civil War|uprising]] against Assad. The sources praised the fundamentalist rebel group [[Ahrar al-Sham]] for having done "a brilliant job" during the subsequent firefight.&lt;ref name=DailyBeast /&gt;

==2015 revision of the course of events==
[[File:Richard Engel receiving 2015 Peabody Award for NBC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Richard Engel]] receiving the 2015 [[Peabody Award]] for NBC's coverage of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]].]]

More than two years later, in April 2015, NBC News revised its narrative of the 2012 kidnapping, stating that it was highly likely that Engel and his team were abducted by a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] rebel group rather than by pro-regime [[Shabiha]]. Engel explained that their abductors had "put on an elaborate ruse to convince us they were Shiite shabiha militiamen". He upheld that they were rescued by Ahrar al-Sham, stating that a "bearded gunman" he referred to as the Islamist group's local commander Abu Ayman, had approached and told them they were safe now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=[[Richard Engel]] |author2=NBC News |title=New Details on 2012 Kidnapping of NBC News Team in Syria |publisher=[[NBC News]] |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/new-details-2012-kidnapping-nbc-news-team-syria-n342356 |date=15 April 2015 |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before, the ''[[New York Times]]'' had conducted several dozen interviews, suggesting that the NBC team "was almost certainly taken by a Sunni criminal element affiliated with the Free Syrian Army." The suspect group was named as the [[North Idlib Falcons Brigade]], led by Azzo Qassab and Shukri Ajouj, who were said to have a history of smuggling and other crimes. According to current and former employees, NBC executives had already been informed of Ajouj and Qassab’s possible involvement during the kidnapping. NBC had also received [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] data showing the captives being held in a chicken farm that was widely known by local residents and other rebels as being controlled by the rebel group. Nevertheless, NBC had put Richard Engel on the air with an account blaming Shiite captors.&lt;ref name=NYT2015&gt;{{cite news |author1=Ravi Somaiya |author2=[[C. J.

The term, '''[[petrodollar]] warfare''', refers to the alleged motivation of [[foreign policy of the United States|US military offensives]] as preserving by force the status of the [[United States dollar]] as the world's dominant [[reserve currency]] and as the currency in which [[petroleum|oil]] is priced.  The term was coined by William R. Clark, who has written a book with the same title. The phrase ''oil [[currency war]]'' is sometimes used with the same meaning.

== The hypothesis ==
The [[United States dollar]] remains ''[[de facto]]'' [[world currency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schulmeister|first=Stephan|date=2000-03|title=Globalization without Global Money: The Double Role of the Dollar as National Currency and World Currency|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01603477.2000.11490246|journal=Journal of Post Keynesian Economics|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=365–395|doi=10.1080/01603477.2000.11490246|issn=0160-3477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, almost all [[petroleum|oil]] sales throughout the world are [[Denomination (currency)|denominated]] in United States dollars (USD).&lt;ref name=china&gt;[http://chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-11/19/content_6264602.htm "Ahmadinejad: Remove US dollar as major oil trading currency"], ''[[China Daily]]'', 19 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Because most countries rely on oil imports, they are forced to maintain large stockpiles of dollars in order to continue imports. This creates a consistent demand for USDs and ostensibly supports the USD's value, regardless of economic conditions in the United States. 

According to proponents of the petrodollar warfare hypothesis, this in turn allegedly allows the US government to gain revenues through [[seignorage]] and by issuing [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] at lower interest rates than supposedly they otherwise would be able to. As a result, the U.S. government, according to this theory, can run higher [[budget deficit]]s at a more sustainable level than most other countries can.  The theory points out that a  stronger USD also means that goods imported into the United States are relatively cheap (although the country's  exports become relatively more expensive for the rest of the world).

Another component of the hypothesis is that the [[price of petroleum]] is more stable in the U.S. than anywhere else since importers do not need to worry about exchange rate fluctuations. Since the U.S. imports a great deal of oil, its markets are heavily reliant on oil and its derivative products (jet fuel, diesel fuel, gasoline, etc.) for their energy needs. As the price of oil can be an important political factor, U.S. administrations are quite sensitive to the price of oil.

Political competitors of the United States therefore have some interest in seeing oil denominated in euros or other currencies. The EU could also theoretically accrue the same benefits if the euro replaced the dollar.

== History ==
The petrodollar system originated in the early 1970s in the wake of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] collapse. President [[Richard Nixon]] and his Secretary of State, [[Henry Kissinger]], feared that the abandonment of the international gold standard under the Bretton Woods arrangement (combined with a growing US trade deficit, and massive debt associated with the ongoing Vietnam War) would cause a decline in the relative global demand of the U.S. dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Petrodollar Warfare|last=Clark|first=William R.|publisher=New Society Publishers|year=2005|isbn=0-86571-514-9|location=Canada|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of meetings, the United States — represented by then U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger — and the Saudi royal family made an agreement. The United States would offer military protection for Saudi Arabia’s oil fields, and in return the Saudi's would price their oil sales exclusively in United States dollars (in other words, the Saudis were to refuse all other currencies, except the U.S. dollar, as payment for their oil exports).

By 1975, all of the oil-producing nations of [[OPEC]] had agreed to price their oil in dollars and to invest surplus oil proceeds in U.S. government debt securities in exchange for similar offers by the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Petrodollar Warfare|last=Clark|first=William R.|publisher=New Society Publishers|year=2005|isbn=0-86571-514-9|location=Canada|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political events ==
In 2000, Iraq converted all its oil transactions under the [[Oil for Food program]] to euros,&lt;ref name="switch"&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/features/2000/11/01112000160846.asp "Iraq: Baghdad Moves To Euro"] by Charles Recknagel, [[Radio Free Europe]] website, 1 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; even though the move was deemed by analysts to "fly in the face of financial logic.",&lt;ref name="switch" /&gt; since, it meant that Iraq would earn less interest on its oil revenues, which were held in a UN-monitored [[escrow]] account in New York. Also, the switch would create "cumbersome new administrative processes" because Baghdad decided to keep also its existing deposits in dollars, which meant that the oil-for-food program would maintain two accounts, one in dollars and one in euros.&lt;ref name="switch" /&gt;

After the [[Iraq War|U.S. invaded Iraq]] in 2003, Iraq returned the denomination of its oil sales to the US Dollar, despite the greenback's then-fall in value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedossier.info/articles/ft_iraq-returns-to-international-oil-market.pdf "Iraq returns to international oil market"] by Carola Hoyos and Kevin Morrison, ''[[Financial Times]]'', June 5, 2003 (from ''TheDossier.com'' archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] ostensibly takes this theory as fact. As retaliation to this policy, which is seen by [[Tehran]] as "[[Neocolonialism|neoimperialism]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HA21Ak01.html What the Iran 'nuclear issue' is really about] by [[Chris Cook (oil executive)|Chris Cook]], ''[[Asia Times Online]]'', January 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Iran made an effort to create its own [[Iranian Oil Bourse|bourse]], which started selling oil in gold, [[euros]], dollars, and Japanese [[yen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HC10Ak01.html Why Iran's oil bourse can't break the buck] by [[F. William Engdahl]], ''Asia Times Online'', March 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2006 [[Venezuela]] indicated "support" of Iran's decision to offer global oil trade in the euro currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6202791.stm|title=Venezuela mulls euro oil switch|date=22 December 2006|newspaper=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|agency=[[BBC]] News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muammar Gaddafi]], of Libya had tried to implement the gold-for-oil plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Videos.php/2011/05/08/gaddafi-gold-for-oil-dollar-doom-plans-b|title=Gaddafi gold-for-oil, dollar-doom plans behind Libya 'mission'?|website=www.thepeoplesvoice.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011, and the introduction of a [[Modern gold dinar|Libyan gold dinar]].

In 2005, William Roberts Clark, Professor and Faculty Associate, Political Science Department, Center for Political Studies, [[University of Michigan]], [[Ann Arbor]], published a work which claimed that a "petrodollar warfare" was under way between mainly the Euro and the United States Dollar waged in the field of world petroleum trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petrodollarwarfare.com Petrodollar Warfare website of William R. Clark]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the years, multiple scholars expressed the view that the Iraq War conducted to re-assert the [[Dollar Hegemony|dollar hegemony]] in the wake of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s attempts to switch from petrodollar in the oil trade and to sell Iraqi oil in exchange for other currencies or commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shipley|first=Tyler|date=2007-03|title=Currency Wars: Oil, Iraq, and the Future of Us Hegemony|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19187033.2007.11675090|journal=Studies in Political Economy|language=en|volume=79|issue=1|pages=7–34|doi=10.1080/19187033.2007.11675090|issn=0707-8552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shor, Francis.

The '''Pine County Fair''' is an annual event held at the [[Pine County, Minnesota|Pine County]] Fairgrounds in [[Pine City, Minnesota]], United States. The [[fair]], like many in Minnesota, includes [[amusement ride]]s, live entertainment and exhibits of [[Livestock|farm animals]], [[food]], and [[Floral design|flowers]] along with other types of specialty displays.  Youth members of [[4-H]] and [[Future Farmers of America]] participate by showing their animals and specialty collections.  
===Demolition derby===
Pine County Fair’s biggest draw is the Demolition Derby. Considered the “hardest hitting demolition derby in the Midwest”,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tpt.org/derby-fever-the-movie/&lt;/ref&gt; the derby draws around 100 registrants each year and sells thousands of tickets, bringing in one-third of the total spending at the fair each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pinecitymn.com/news/study-pine-county-fair-brings-in-k/article_227f750c-5557-11e8-ad27-6f85894ae696.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It is held during the first weekend of August.

'''The Protection from Harassment Act 1997''' (c 40) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. On introducing the Bill's second reading in the House of Lords the then [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Lord Mackay of Clashfern]] said "The aim of this Bill is to protect the victims of [[harassment]]. It will protect all such victims whatever the source of the harassment—so-called [[stalking]] behaviour, racial harassment, or anti-social behaviour by neighbours."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard|HL Deb]] 24 January 1997 vol 577 cc 917-43&lt;/ref&gt; Home Office guidance on the Act&lt;ref&gt;Home Office circular 018/2012&lt;/ref&gt; says "The legislation was always intended to tackle stalking, but the offences were drafted to tackle any form of persistent conduct which causes another person alarm or distress." 

Infield and Platford described the Act as "[[Controversy|controversial]]".&lt;ref name="Infield and Platford page x"/&gt;

==Provisions==

===Section 1===
This section prohibits a person from pursuing "a course of conduct" which "amounts to harassment of another" and which "he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other". A person is taken to know that conduct is harassment if "a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think the course of conduct amounted to harassment of the other".

The [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]] inserted the offence of [[stalking]] in relation to this section and is defined to include things like monitoring a person online, contacting a person, loitering in a public or private place, interfering with property or spying/watching a person.

==== Section 1 (1A) ====
Section 1(1A) was inserted by section 125(2)(a) of the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]]. It prohibits a person from pursuing a course of conduct "which involves harassment of two or more persons" with the intention of persuading any person (not necessarily one of the persons harassed) to do or refrain from doing something they are lawfully entitled to do or not do.

According to Baroness Scotland of Ashall, promoting the Bill in the House of Lords, this provision and the associated provisions of section 3A were intended to strengthen "the protection afforded to the bioscience industry, and those who work in it" including by "making it an offence to protest outside a person's home in a way that causes harassment, alarm or distress to the residents of that home."&lt;ref&gt;Hansard: Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill
HL Deb 14 March 2005 vol 670 cc1077-93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 2===
This section creates the offence of harassment, which is to pursue "a course of conduct" in breach of section 1 of the Act. It is a [[summary offence]]. A person guilty of this offence is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a to fine not exceeding level 5 on the [[standard scale]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 2(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2(3) was repealed by section 107 of, and Schedule 8 to, the [[Police Reform Act 2002]].

===Section 2A===
The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 did not originally define "stalking" or formally proscribe it.&lt;ref&gt;(1998) 142 [[Solicitors Journal]] 604 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YHQ4AQAAIAAJ Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

This section creates a specific offence of stalking. It followed a commitment given by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, on 8 March 2012 ([[International Women's Day]]) to remedy perceived deficiencies in the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Stalking - Commons Library Standard Note SN06261 Published 21 March 2013 (Amended 10 September 2013) Pat Strickland&lt;/ref&gt;

The offence created by this section is a summary offence and a person guilty of it is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 51 weeks, or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 2A(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

This section was inserted by section 111(1) of the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]].

===Section 2B===
This section, which confers, on justices of the peace, a power to issue a [[search warrant]] to allow constables to enter and search premises for evidence of offences under section 2A, was inserted by section 112 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.

===Section 3===
This section provides for a claim in civil proceedings (creating a statutory [[tort]]) by anyone who is or who may be a victim of conduct falling within section 1. It provides for damages for anxiety caused by the harassment and any financial loss it causes, as well as providing for an [[injunction]] to restrain the defendant from conduct amounting to harassment. Where any person against whom an injunction has been granted under this section does "without reasonable excuse" anything prohibited by that injunction, section 3(6) of the Act makes that person guilty of an offence.

Offences under section 3(6) are [[triable either way]]. A person guilty of an offence under section 3(6) is liable, on conviction on [[indictment]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[statutory maximum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 3(9)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 3A===
This section provides similar injunction provisions to those in section 3, but in this case applying to the offence created by section 1(1A). However, in addition to it allowing the person who is the victim or who may be the victim of the conduct in question to seek an injunction, it also gives a similar right to someone whose behaviour the harassment is intended to influence.

Section 3A was inserted by section 125(5) of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.

===Section 4===
This section creates the offence of "putting people in fear of violence" where a person "causes another to fear, on at least two occasions, that violence will be used against him" provided "he knows or ought to know that his course of conduct will cause the other so to fear on each of those occasions".&lt;ref&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 4(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of defences. These include showing that the course of conduct is pursued for the "purpose of preventing or detecting crime" or "reasonable for the protection of himself or another or for the protection of his or another’s property."&lt;ref&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 4(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, David Ormerod said that this section "could have been drafted more clearly all round".&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, D C. "Commentary" to R v DPP [2001] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 396 at 398&lt;/ref&gt;

Offences under section 4 are triable either way. A person guilty of an offence under section 4 is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 4(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 4A===
This section creates the offence of stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress. This requires there to be a person A whose "course of conduct ... amounts to stalking" and a person B who is affected by the course of conduct. The course of conduct must either cause B "to fear, on at least two occasions, that violence will be used against B" or causes B "serious alarm or distress which has a substantial adverse effect on B's usual day-to-day activities".

Offences under section 4A are triable either way. A person guilty of an offence under section 4A is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 4A(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

This section was inserted by section 111(2) of the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]]. The stalking element is defined as include acts like monitoring a person online, contacting a person, loitering in a public or private place, interfering with property or spying/watching a person.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/section/111/enacted&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 5===
This section gives a court dealing with a person convicted of an offence under sections 2 (harassment) or 4 (putting in fear of violence) of the Act the power to make a restraining order for the purpose of protecting "the victim of the offence" or "any other person mentioned in the order".

Offences under section 5 are triable either way. A person guilty of an offence under section 5 is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 5(6)&lt;/ref&gt;

This section has effect in relation to a person convicted of an offence under section 32 of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] as if the reference in subsection (1) of this section to an offence under section 2 or 4 included a reference to an offence under the said section 32.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], section 32(7)&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 5(3A) was inserted by section 12(2) of the [[Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004]].

Section 5(4A) was inserted by section 12(3) of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004.

Section 5(7) was inserted by section 12(4) of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004.

===Section 5A===
This section provides for a court to impose a restraining order on someone who has been ''acquitted'' of an offence, if the court considers it necessary "to protect a person from harassment by the defendant".
This section was inserted by section 12(5) of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004.

===Section 7===
This is the interpretation section. "Harassing" is defined (non-exclusively) as including "alarming" or "causing distress".

Section 7(3) was substituted by section 125(7)(a) of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. It now provides that a "course of conduct" requires either conduct on at least two occasions in relation to one person, or, where the harassment is alleged against two or more occasions, conduct in relation to at least one occasion in relation to each person.

Section 7(3A) was inserted by section 44(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001]].

Section 7(5) was inserted by section 125(7)(b) of the Serious Organised 
Crime and Police Act 2005.

===Section 8===
Section 8 creates a civil action for harassment applying in Scotland only (sections 1-7 apply only in England and Wales).

===Section 8A===
This section was inserted by section 1(2) of the [[Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2011]] (asp 13).

===Section 15===
The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (Commencement) (No. 1) Order 1997 (SI 1997/1418) (C 52) was made under section 15(1).

The following orders were made under section 15(2):
*The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (Commencement) (No. 2) Order 1997 (SI 1997/1498) (C 58)
*The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (Commencement No. 3) Order 1998 (SI 1998/1902) (C 42)

== Racially or religiously aggravated harassment ==
Section 32 of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] now provides that where a person commits an offence under section 2 or 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act which is "racially or religiously aggravated" within the meaning of section 28 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended by the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]]) he is guilty of an [[offence triable either way]]. 

A person convicted on indictment of an offence falling within section 32(1)(a) of the 1998 Act (the racially or religiously aggravated version of the offence under section 2 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997) is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine, or to both. A person convicted of indictment of an offence falling within section 32(1)(b) of the 1998 Act (the racially or religiously aggravated version of the offence under section 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997) is liable to [[imprisonment]] for a term not exceeding seven years or to a fine{{how much|date=October 2018}}, or to both.

==Definition==
In England and Wales, the Act now creates offences of harassment,&lt;ref&gt;Section 2(1)&lt;/ref&gt; stalking,&lt;ref&gt;Section 2A(1)&lt;/ref&gt; putting people in fear of violence,&lt;ref&gt;Section 4(1)&lt;/ref&gt; stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress,&lt;ref&gt;Section 4A(1)&lt;/ref&gt; breach of injunction&lt;ref&gt;Section 3(6)&lt;/ref&gt; and breach of restraining order.&lt;ref&gt;Section 5(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone who believes they are the victim of harassment falling within section 1 of the Act may (either instead of or in addition to a criminal prosecution) elect to pursue a civil remedy for damages for anxiety or for financial loss arising from harassment: section 3(2). Section 3 creates a statutory tort based on the same acts as the criminal offence. An example of this tort in action appears in ''Green v DB Group Services (UK) Ltd'' [2006] EWHC 1898 [[Queen's Bench Division|QB]] (1 August 2006).&lt;ref name="bailii.org"&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2006/1898.html] Green v DB Group Services&lt;/ref&gt; which was a case of severe and prolonged workplace bullying resulting in serious illness of the claimant.

If a claimant elects to pursue the section 3 [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] remedy, the standard of proof which needs to be shown is the common law standard of proof on "the balance of probabilities" (more likely than not) rather than the standard for [[criminal law]] which is proof [[beyond reasonable doubt]].

The editor of "Archbold" notes the Act does not attempt to define "harassment".&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]] 2009. Para 19-277A at p 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Thomas v News Group Newspapers and Another'' (2001), Lord Philips [[Master of the Rolls|MR]] said: "'Harassment' is, however, a word which has a meaning which is generally understood. It describes conduct targeted at an individual which is calculated to produce the consequences described in section 7 and which is oppressive and unreasonable."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas v News Group Newspapers and Another [2001] EWCA Civ 1233 [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1233.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 7(2) of the Act provides that, for the purpose of the interpretation of sections 1 to 5A, references to harassing a person include alarming the person or causing the person distress.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, Jonathan. Criminal Law: Text, Cases, and Materials. OUP. 2004. p 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 5 of the Act gives the court in criminal cases a power to grant restraining orders and section 5A, introduced by the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, extends this power to cases where the defendant was acquitted, if the court "considers it necessary to do so to protect a person from harassment by the defendant.".&lt;ref&gt;section 5A&lt;/ref&gt; The power to grant restraining orders was characterised as "the most important aspect of the Act" by practitioners interviewed in a Home Office research study (2000) into the effectiveness of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;p.56 Home Office Research Study 203&lt;/ref&gt; The power to grant restraining orders is separate from and additional to the ability of claimants to seek injunctions in civil actions brought under section 3 of the Act. However, in each case the penalties for breach of a restraining order or an injunction are similar: on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or a fine, or both, or on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or both.&lt;ref&gt;sections 3(9) and 5(6)of the Act.&lt;/ref&gt;

The summary offences of harassment "cast the net too wide".&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Dennis J; Williams, Glanville. Textbook of Criminal Law. Third Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. {{ISBN|978-041-404613-9}}. 2012. Para 9-071 at p 285.&lt;/ref&gt; The offence created by section 2 is "broad and ill-defined".&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, D C. "Commentary" to R v Colahan [2001] Crim LR 845 at 846&lt;/ref&gt; Its scope is "quite enormous".&lt;ref&gt;Simester, A P; Sullivan, G R. Criminal Law Theory and Doctrine. First Edition. Hart. 2000. p 394&lt;/ref&gt; It might well violate Articles [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|10]] and [[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights|11]] of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (in addition to Article 7 mentioned below).&lt;ref&gt;Simester and Sullivan. Criminal Law Theory and Doctrine. Second Edition. p 398&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Course of conduct===
Section 7(3) of the Act provides that a course of conduct must involve conduct on at least two occasions. (Originally these occasions needed to involve the same person, but the Act was amended by the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] so that "pursuing a course of conduct" could mean approaching two people just once.&lt;ref name="monbiot5feb09" /&gt;)

In [[Wainwright v. Home Office]] (2003), Lord Hoffmann said "The requirement of a course of conduct shows that Parliament was conscious that it might not be in the public interest to allow the law to be set in motion for one boorish incident."&lt;ref&gt;[2003] UKHL 53 at paragraph 46 per Lord Hoffmann&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act contains no definition of "course of conduct" beyond the provisions of sections 7(3) and (4).&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, D C. "Commentary" to Lau v DPP [2000] Crim LR 580 at 581&lt;/ref&gt; Case law has established that "merely because there are two incidents between the same parties, this will not inevitably give rise to a course of conduct" and "the requirement of a nexus between the incidents appears an eminently sensible way in which to limit the potentially immense reach of the offence of harassment."&lt;ref&gt;Finch, Emily. "Commentary" to Pratt v Director of Public Prosecutions, The Times (22 August 2001) Journal of Criminal Law, JCL 66(4)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, David Ormerod said that the "course of conduct" element defies definition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===''Mens rea''===
[[Constructive knowledge]]&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Michael J. Textbook on Criminal Law. Ninth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2007. {{ISBN|9780199215843}}.
[https://books.google.com/books?id=DDRzO7o14jEC&amp;pg=PA102 Page 102]. (Used as "the basis for liability" for offences under sections 2 and 4).&lt;/ref&gt; or actual knowledge{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} is an element of the offences under sections 2, 2A, 4 and 4A; that is, the prosecution has to show that the defendant "knows or ought to know" that the course of conduct complained of has the prescribed effects on the person at whom it is directed. The test of "ought to know" is based on what "a reasonable person in possession of the same information" would think about the course of conduct in question.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 1(2), 4(2), 4A(2) and 4A(3)&lt;/ref&gt; Section 4(2) "has an unusual type of ''mens rea'' with objective and subjective components."&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, D C. "Commentary" to R v Henley [2000] Crim LR 582 at 584&lt;/ref&gt; The justification for the imposition of liability based on constructive knowledge is the difficulty which might exist of proving ''mens rea'' on the part of "stalkers" who often suffer from mental or personality disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Michael J. Textbook on Criminal Law. 10th Edition. Oxford University Press. 2009. {{ISBN|9780199551347}}. Page 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threshold===
There are a multitude of thresholds within the act and law, the protection from harassment act does NOT comply with the [[rule of law]] as there is uncertainty, due to the issues of criminal and civil liability, the reasonable person, the day to day dealings with others, and where there is Section 1 (3) of the act, setting out reasonable (S1 (3) (c)) to comply with a rule of law or order under any enactment (S1 (3) (b) and for the detection and prevention of crime S1 (3) (a).  in [[Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas’s NHS Trust|Majrowski v Guy’s and St. Thomas’s NHS Trust [2007] 1 AC 224]] was a mention of the Threshold for harassment to "sustain a criminal liability"
Para 30:
''"In most cases courts should have little difficulty in applying the 'close connection' test. Where the claim meets that requirement, and the quality of the conduct said to constitute harassment is being examined, courts will have in mind that irritations, annoyances, even a measure of upset, arise at times in everybody's day-to-day dealings with other people. Courts are well able to recognise the boundary between conduct which is unattractive, even unreasonable, and conduct which is oppressive and unacceptable. To cross the boundary from the regrettable to the unacceptable the gravity of the misconduct must be of an order which would sustain criminal liability under section 2."''

unfortunately this boundary is a discretion of the court and judges and is NOT applied in most courts across the UK. The issue with conduct which will cause alarm and distress as a civil liability or for a "cause to action" is a "subjective" and often "tainted" view which has elements of [[Heuristics and biases|heuristic bias]] as will the "defendant" to a claim of harassment.


Criminal charges  undertaken where a person is using S1 (3) has a difficult task in what appears to be at every stage of the proceeding's ( including pre actions Protocols) in UKSC 17 (2013) Lord Reed Said at para 29:
''"That Parliament should have intended section 1(3)(a) to apply, regardless of whether the pursuit of the course of conduct was objectively reasonable or not, may at first sight seem surprising, given that the conduct must otherwise constitute harassment before section 1(3)(a) can come into play.''"

Therefore the issue arises where a defendant must be found criminally guilty before they can make a defence, however the main defect in the court is that they only seek to find harassment, but stop at any defence or "avowed" purpose and the Supreme court commented on the difficulty in the matter of the two tests applied  which are subjective and objective. 

UKSC17 (2013) at P12:
 "''The difficulty about a wholly '''objective test''' is that it is not consistent with either the language or the purpose of the Act. The only wholly objective test which could work in this context is one based on the reasonableness of the alleged harasser in supposing that there was a crime to be prevented or detected or that his conduct was calculated to achieve those ends.''" 

"A wholly '''subjective test,''' on the other hand, such as the one that the judge applied to Mr Willoughby, is equally problematic. Before the defence can arise, it must be shown that the victim has been harassed"
"I do not doubt that in the context of section 1(3)(a) purpose is a subjective state of mind. But in my opinion, the necessary control mechanism is to be found in the concept of rationality, which Eady J touched on in Howlett v Holding [2006] EWHC 41 (QB) and Moses LJ seems to have been reaching for in his judgment in the present case. Rationality is a familiar concept in public law."

Alarm and distress was set out in the Data protection act 1998 S10, however was modified in 2017 to "significant Alarm and distress" a short coming within the enactment of harassment which has been largely undefined and illegal since its first concepts.

==Employers' liability==
Employers have [[vicarious liability]] for harassment by their employees under section 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (see ''[[Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2006] UKHL 34, [2006] ICR 1199&lt;/ref&gt;). For employees this may provide an easier route to compensation than claims based on discrimination legislation or personal injury claims for stress at work, as the elements of harassment are likely to be easier to prove, the statutory defence is not available to the employer, and it may be easier to establish a claim for compensation. Also as the claim can be made in either the [[High Court]] or the [[County Court]] costs may be recoverable by the successful party, subject to relevant court rules and limits.

==Number of prosecutions==
The Bill for this Act said that it was expected to result in about two hundred prosecutions a year.&lt;ref&gt;Explanatory Memorandum to the Protection from Harassment Bill.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, there were nearly six ''thousand'' prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, D C. "Commentary" to R v Colohan [2001] Crim LR 845 at 846&lt;/ref&gt; A written question, raised by a [[Member of Parliament]] in 2008 and relating to prosecutions under section 2 from the date of the Act to 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Hansard:HC Deb 30 Jun 2008 : Column 687W&lt;/ref&gt; showed the numbers of persons proceeded against under section 2 remained fairly steady during the period (5,540 in 1999 of whom 2,753 were found guilty, 5,446 in 2006 of whom 3,768 were found guilty). A 2011 written question&lt;ref&gt;Hansard:HC Deb 21 Nov 2011: Column 167W&lt;/ref&gt; requesting information about prosecutions under section 2 during the period 2006-2009 showed 5,006 persons proceeded against during 2006-7 of whom 3,543 were found guilty, 4,940 proceeded against during 2007-8 of whom 3,650 were found guilty and 4,865 proceeded against during 2008-9 of whom 3,892 were found guilty.

==Northern Ireland==
The [[Protection from Harassment (Northern Ireland) Order 1997]] (SI 1997/1180) (NI 9) was made under paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the [[Northern Ireland Act 1974]] (as modified by section 13 of this Act) only for purposes corresponding to those of sections 1 to 7 and 12 of this Act.

==Scotland==
In Scotland the Act works differently. [[Civil remedies]] include [[damages]], [[interdict]] and [[non-harassment order]]s&lt;ref&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 8(5)&lt;/ref&gt; backed by powers of arrest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Any person who is in breach of a non-harassment order made under section 8 is guilty of an offence and liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, and, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 9(1), as repealed in part by section 49(2)(a) of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A breach of a non-harassment order is not otherwise punishable.&lt;ref&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, section 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Scots lawyers are of the view that there was no need for this Act to extend to Scotland because the law of Scotland already dealt satisfactorily with harassment and contained no relevant lacuna corresponding to any which existed in English law.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson-Cruttenden, Timothy; Addison, Neil. Blackstone's Guide to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Blackstone Press Limited. 1997. Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Act resulted from the efforts of Evonne Leonora Von Heussen. A stalking victim herself, she launched the National Association for Victims of Stalking and Harassment (NASH) in 1993, when her then teen-age daughter was stalked by a dangerous character who was known to carry a knife. After Von Heussen found that she could get no help from the police, lawyers, or her local [[Member of Parliament]] she began researching anti-stalking laws in other countries.  She opened a help line on which she eventually took tens of thousands of calls. She pursued each call with each victim's MP, and attracted a large amount of media attention.  After several years of effort she persuaded the [[Home Office]] under Prime Minister [[John Major]] to take the issue on as a matter of government policy. She wrote the first draft of the Act and worked closely with ministers and senior civil servants in the Home Office and the [[Lord Chancellor]]'s Department as the final version took shape.  She advised ministers from her seat in the Under Gallery, on the floor of the House of Commons, during the Second Reading Debate.  After Royal Assent she worked with Home Office and Lord Chancellor's Department in training judges, lawyers, other court personnel, police and voluntary organizations in the use of the Act.  She received the MBE in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] List (1997) for her efforts. She also worked as a consultant on a number of court cases involving stalking and harassment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 was preceded by the [[Stalking Bill 1996|Stalking Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;John Marston and Katherine Thompson (1997) 161 [[Justice of the Peace and Local Government Law]] 739 (2 August) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OIMwAQAAIAAJ Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Jason-Lloyd (1997) 161 Justice of the Peace and Local Government Law 787 (16 August)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Some magistrates felt criminalising harassment cases might lead to unfounded accusations from complainants who are mistaken about another’s behaviour or are even vindictive. Prosecutors accepted this point and agreed that they had to be on the lookout for what the police sometimes termed paranoid woman syndrome, where the putative victim read more into another's behaviour than was perhaps warranted." However, "they agreed that the difficulties in pursuing harassment cases were no greater than other kinds of case – such as domestic violence – where the parties are often well known to each other."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Jessica.

In February 2012, the Rt Hon [[Elfyn Llwyd]] MP, chairing an Independent Parliamentary Inquiry into reform of stalking law, said the Act was "not an effective tool against stalking". "[T]oo many perpetrators were falling through the net." The "attitudes of many working in the criminal justice system and society towards stalking remain in the dark ages."&lt;ref name="Elfyn Llwyd"&gt;Independent Parliamentary Inquiry into Stalking Law Reform, Main Findings and Recommendations, February 2012 at p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators such as [[George Monbiot]] have voiced the concern that the amended Act effectively "allows the police to ban any campaign they please", and that it has been used to prosecute peaceful protestors.&lt;ref name="monbiot5feb09"&gt;[[George Monbiot]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 February 2009, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/05/anti-stalking-liberty-central Why protesters are now stalkers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Addison thought that the Act was being misused and suggested it be amended so as to decriminalize harassment (but not breach of a court order prohibiting harassment). He said that if the Act was not amended "there is a clear danger that it could come to be seen as an oppressive piece of legislation".&lt;ref&gt;Neil Addison, "Dangers of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997", [[The Times]], 21 March 2000.

Following the passage of the Act, police forces started to issue "prevention of harassment" notices, also known as "Police Information Notices" (PINs), to people against whom claims of harassment had been made.&lt;ref name=Strickland2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06411/SN06411.pdf|title=Harassment: “Police Information Notices”|author=Pat Strickland|publisher=House of Commons Library|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are believed to have been created by police forces as a way of preventing people accused of harassment from claiming ignorance that their alleged behavior was undesired and thus avoiding successful prosecution under the Act due to lack of ''mens rea''.&lt;ref name=Strickland2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmhaff/263/263we27.htm|title=Select Committee on Home Affairs Written Evidence: Memorandum submitted by the Association of Chief Police Officers Stalking and Harassment Portfolio|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|date= 1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their use has been the subject of controversy, with some describing the notices as "unnecessarily menacing and accusatorial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2013-0114.html|title=JUDGMENT: R (on the application of Catt) [2015] UKSC 9 |publisher=The Supreme Court|date=4 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, whilst [[Theresa May]] was Home Secretary, the [[Home Office]] published a consultation on stalking which said: "We recognise that there are concerns around the process by which these notices are issued. Some argue that those issued with a Police Information Notice are not given a fair hearing. Equally we are aware that some consider Police Information Notices to lack teeth and that they give victims a false sense of security."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/157898/consultation.pdf |title=Consultation on stalking |publisher=Home Office |date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, the [[Commons Select Committee of Privileges]] investigated the issuing in 2012 of a PIN against an MP for statements made in Parliament. Their findings led the police to withdraw the notice.&lt;ref name=Strickland2015/&gt; 

In 2015, the issuing of a PIN against a British journalist raised concerns about civil liberties and press freedom, creating demands for reform of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/more-300-journalists-politicians-and-press-freedom-supporters-urge-met-cancel-reporters-harassment|title=More than 500 journalists, politicians and press freedom supporters urge Met to cancel reporter's harassment warning|publisher=Press Gazette|author=William Turvill|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jun/23/ipcc-rejects-appeal-over-harassment-warning-to-newspaper-reporter|title=IPCC rejects appeal over harassment warning to newspaper reporter |author=Roy Greenslade|publisher=The Guardian|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because a PIN has no statutory basis and therefore no legal effect, there is no right of appeal against it, although a complaint can be made to the issuing police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rozenberg|first=Joshua|date=23 December 2015 |title=The police should take more care with their harassment notices |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/03/police-harassment-warning-notices-diane-louise-jordan |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Roots: The Next Generations''''' is an American [[television]] [[Miniseries#Television|miniseries]], introduced in 1979, continuing, from 1882 to the 1960s, the fictionalized story of the family of [[Alex Haley]] and their life in [[Henning, Tennessee|Henning]], [[Lauderdale County, Tennessee|Lauderdale County]], [[Tennessee]], USA. (Henning is about 48 miles north of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], which is on the [[Mississippi River]] and in the southwest corner of the state, and which was then the largest city in it.) This sequel to the [[Roots (1977 miniseries)|1977 miniseries]] is based on the last seven chapters of Haley's novel entitled ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Roots-Saga-American-Family-Haley/dp/B00EL9FOBG|title=Roots: The Saga of an American Family|first=Alex|last=Haley|authorlink=Alex Haley|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday &amp; Co.]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1976|isbn=978-1125873892}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus additional material by Haley.

==Plot summary==
For the first part of the story, see ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]''

===Chapter 1 – 1880s===
The story resumes in 1882, 12 years after the arrival of "Chicken George" Moore ([[Avon Long]]) and his family in Henning, in [[West Tennessee]]. George, elderly and showing his age, moves in with Tom Harvey ([[Georg Stanford Brown]]), one of his sons, along with Tom’s wife, Irene ([[Lynne Moody]]), and their two daughters, Elizabeth and Cynthia. Tom, a [[family|great-grandson]] of [[Kunta Kinte]], has become a leader of the [[African American|black]] community in Henning. Although he has established a working relationship with the town's white leader, Col. Frederick Warner ([[Henry Fonda]]), a former [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Confederate States Army|Army]], race relations are strained, due in part to the new [[Jim Crow laws]] and similar influences.

Col. Warner's younger son, Jim ([[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]]), meets and falls in love with Carrie Barden (Fay Hauser), an attractive young [[African American|African-American]] [[teacher|schoolteacher]] and a [[graduation|graduate]] of [[Fisk University]], a black school in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] (the [[capital city|capital]] of the state and in [[Middle Tennessee]]). Tom has taken the lead in hiring Carrie for the local school for the black children. Col. Warner disapproves of the relationship between Jim and Carrie, so he seeks to persuade Tom to fire Carrie or to close the school. After an argument between Tom and his older daughter, Elizabeth ([[Debbi Morgan]]), about his refusal to accept her [[courtship|suitor]], John Dolan ([[Brian Stokes Mitchell]]), because he is half white, Tom decides to allow Carrie to continue teaching. Jim and Carrie [[wedding|marry]] in Memphis, then Col. Warner [[inheritance|disinherits]] Jim (by removing him from his [[will (law)|will]]), but he says that he will ensure that no harm comes to the couple from the hoodlum white element of the town. Jim, with his new [[bride]], receives a warm welcome to the local black church.

A year later, Chicken George dies in 1883 at age 83, and the family bury his body beside that of his wife, Mathilda "Tildy", who died in 1875 at age 76.

===Chapter 2 – Turn of the 20th Century===
In August 1896, 13 years later, Elizabeth, Tom's older daughter, arrives from [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]], for an extended visit, amid tension between Tom and Elizabeth, due to Tom's rejection of her suitor years before.

Cynthia "Cinthy" (Bever-Leigh Banfield), Tom's younger daughter, meets and falls in love with Will Palmer ([[Stan Shaw]]), an ambitious and hard-working young man; after a properly supervised [[courtship]] the couple marry in their church.

Andrew Warner ([[Marc Singer]]), an [[unemployment|unemployed]] [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] and the older son of Col. Warner, becomes interested in [[politics]], and he eventually opposes his father in the public arena.

While Will works for Bob Campbell ([[Harry Morgan]]) at his [[lumber yard|lumberyard]], he does so in such an enthusiastic, industrious, and effective way that he attracts the attention of both Col. Warner and T.J. Calloway ([[John Carter (actor)|John Carter]]), the local [[bank]]er. Because of Campbell's increasing problems with [[alcoholism|alcohol]] and his decreasing attention to his business, and after Campbell's [[default (finance)|default]] on his loan from the bank, Calloway [[foreclosure|forecloses]], takes over the lumberyard, sells it to Will, and [[loan|finances]] his purchase. Thus the R. Campbell Lumber Company becomes the W.E. Palmer Lumber Company.

By this time Jim and Carrie already have a son, named Frank "Frankie" ([[Marcus Chong]]), and they live peacefully and happily in the black community of Henning.

However, in the atmosphere of the growing anti-black attitudes in the [[southern United States|South]] during the 1890s, [[racism|racial tension]] increases in Henning too, as several incidents demonstrate. For example, Tom suddenly becomes turned away when he again applies to register to [[voting|vote]], and he forcefully insists that every time since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] he has voted without interference, in both [[Alamance County, North Carolina|Alamance County]], [[North Carolina]], and in Lauderdale County, Tennessee.

Will and Cinthy rejoice over the [[birth]] of their daughter, Bertha George, named in part in honor of Chicken George, one of her [[grandparent#great-grandparents|great-grandfathers]].

===Chapter 3 – World War I===
By September 1914, after 17 more years, telephones, electricity, and automobiles have arrived in Henning, both the town and Will Palmer's lumber company have grown, both Tom and Irene Harvey have died, as has Mrs. Warner, and Andrew Warner, the colonel's older son, now serves as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]].

Dr. Frank Warner (E. Lamont Johnson), the son of Jim and Carrie Warner, has completed [[undergraduate education|undergraduate college]], [[medical school in the United States|medical school]], an [[Internship (medicine)|internship]], and a [[residency (medicine)|residency]], and he's about to start his [[medical practice]]. Cinthy calls him "the first colored doctor in the county".

Will has [[prosperity|prospered]] well enough that Will and Cynthia send their daughter, Bertha ([[Irene Cara]]), to [[Lane College]], a black school in [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], Tennessee.

Col. Warner, frail and confused, collapses on a street while Jim, Carrie, and Frank are present nearby. They rush to him, and Frank starts to treat him. However, Earl Crowther ([[Paul Koslo]]), the Warner [[chauffeur]], and a gang of [[redneck]]s take charge, ignore both Jim and Frank and nudge them aside, and insult Frank, who predicts that the colonel will die before they get him to the white [[physician]]. He does indeed die.

At the college Bertha meets and soon falls in love with Simon Alexander Haley ([[Dorian Harewood]]), a [[waiting staff|waiter]] in the dining room and a son of a [[sharecropping|sharecropper]], who lives and works near [[Savannah, Tennessee|Savannah]], [[Hardin County, Tennessee|Hardin County]], Tennessee, about 116 miles due east of Memphis. Simon, who greatly admires [[Booker T. Washington]], quotes to Bertha from his writings, including these words: "The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremest folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges to come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than artificial forcing". Referring to Washington, Simon says, "I have formed my life in his image".

The [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) resurges in Henning. They burn a [[Christian cross|cross]], hold a [[parade]], and burn down the [[clothing]] [[retail|store]] of a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[merchant]], Mr. Goldstein ([[Jiří Voskovec]]), who has moved to Henning from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and who returns there.

Simon leaves Lane College, and he has made plans to continue his [[education]] at the Agricultural and Technical (A&amp;T) College of North Carolina (which later becomes renamed as the [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University|North Carolina Agricultural and Technical (A&amp;T) State University]]), in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], North Carolina. He has applied to enroll in the school and has arranged to work on the [[campus]] to pay for his [[room and board]].

His father, Alec Haley ([[Hal Williams]]) has promised him $50 to pay for his [[tuition payments|tuition]], but now he tells him that he cannot keep his promise because of the recent poor [[crop]]s due to [[flood]]s and [[boll weevil]]s. To avoid becoming an [[debt|indebted]] sharecropper himself, Simon works the [[summer]] as a [[rail transport|railway]] [[porter (railroad)|porter]] for the [[Pullman Company]]. He works with an older porter, Dad Jones ([[Ossie Davis]]), who becomes his fatherly friend and—in one instance with another porter—his protector. During one trip Simon meets and talks with a kindly and [[wealth]]y [[passenger]], R.S.M. Boyce ([[James Daly (actor)|James Daly]]), an [[executive officer#corporate law and other legal associations|executive]] of the [[Curtis Publishing Company]], the [[publishing|publisher]] of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and several other well-known [[magazine]]s. They discuss Simon's plans and difficulties. When Boyce steps off the train, he hands to Simon a generous [[tip (gratuity)|tip]] and one of his [[business card]]s, inviting him to inform him of his progress. When Simon leaves his position to return to school, he learns that Dad was fired for discussing unionization of the porters with a [[labor spy]]. When Simon arrives at the college, he learns that Boyce has already paid for the coming year in full for his [[textbook]]s, tuition, and room and board.

Simon and Bertha continue to keep in touch with each other, and Bertha and her parents, Will and Cynthia, travel to Simon's graduation, where he will receive his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[agriculture]]. When the family arrives at the campus, Bertha receives a message that Simon and six of his classmates have just left and [[military service|enlisted]] in the [[United States Army|US Army]] for service in the [[World War I|World War]] (the "Great War", later renamed as World War I). The young couple see each other briefly when Simon and his all-black [[platoon]] of [[Army recruit|recruits]] board a [[train]] to go to the next stage in his life.

During May 1918 Simon receives his [[recruit training|basic training]] in an all-black [[company (military unit)#Army|company]] at [[Camp Grant (Illinois)|Camp Grant]], Illinois, near [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], about 85 miles west-northwest of Chicago, then he, in an all-black outfit, goes to [[France]] and takes part in the fighting against the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]].

Before Simon goes overseas, Bertha meets Simon in Chicago for a weekend (after Cinthy pleads Bertha's case with Will, who first has vigorously opposed such a trip but eventually allows it).

While Simon is in the Army in France, Cousin Georgia Anderson ([[Lynn Hamilton (actress)|Lynn Hamilton]]), from Kansas City, visits Will and Cinthy, and she reveals that Chicken George fought with the [[Union Army]] during the [[Battle of Fort Pillow]], due west of Henning, on the Chickasaw Bluffs, overlooking the Mississippi River. (That point implies that he survived the infamous [[Fort Pillow Massacre|Massacre of Fort Pillow]].)

In July 1918 Simon receives word in France that his father has died in a [[hospital]] in Memphis; in due time, after the end of the war, Simon returns to the U.S.

Andy Warner raises his political sights even higher, and he becomes elected to the [[United States Senate|US Senate]].

After the Army discharges Simon, on his way back home to Henning, he and several friends stop at the home of one of them in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], in [[East Tennessee]]. While they are there, the [[Knoxville Riot of 1919]] (a part of the [[Red Summer of 1919]]) takes place. Earl Crowther, now an [[personal assistant|aide]] to Sen. Andrew Warner, goes to Knoxville to take part in the mischief, and he dies there (at the hands of one of Simon's Army buddies).

Simon arrives in Henning and receives a robust welcome, especially from Bertha, and the young couple move ahead with the plans for their wedding.

Will builds an attractive [[bungalow]] for Bertha and Simon, assuming that they will settle in Henning, but without asking about their own plans.

On the first Sunday after the completion of the house, the wedding takes place in their church building, then everyone adjourns to the front lawn of the new home for the reception, and a number of white friends and neighbors join them. Among them are Sen. Andy Warner and his fancy new [[wife]], from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], and [[New York City]], who arrive in a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] open [[touring car]] with a chauffeur.

Afterward Mr. and Mrs. Simon Haley [[driving|motor]] away in a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Model T|Model T]] to [[Cornell University]], in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[New York (state)|New York]], where Simon will start working on his [[master's degree]] in agriculture.

Later Will and Cinthy move into the bungalow. (The house still stands; it is now known as the [[Alex Haley House and Museum]], and, as a state-owned historic site, is [http://www.tn.gov/environment/history/history_historic-site-alex-haley.shtml open to the public].)

In November 1921 Simon and Bertha return to Henning to visit Will and Cinthy, and they surprise them with their three-month-old son, [[Alex Haley|Alexander Murray Palmer Haley]], whom Will promptly carries outside, lifts up, and [[ceremony|ceremonially]] shows the [[Moon]], in a [[tradition]] which was first portrayed in the first ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' series by Omoro Kinte and baby Kunta Kinte in [[The Gambia]] in [[West Africa]] in 1750 (though, in the first ''Roots'', the tradition was a naming ritual, where the father held the naked child to the stars, gave the child a name, and said, "behold the only thing greater than yourself.").

===Chapter 4 – The Great Depression===
Late in the summer of 1932, after 11 more years, during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Simon, Bertha, and their children stay temporarily in the bungalow with Will and Cynthia. At age 10 Alex ([[Kristoff St. John|Christoff St. John]], who later respelled his first name as Kristoff) has two younger brothers, George (Stevan Crutchfield), named for Chicken George, and Julius (Ticker Thompson). While working at Will's lumberyard, Simon unsuccessfully tries to show Will better methods for [[bookkeeping]] and [[inventory control]], but Will regards and uses him as a manual [[laborer]].

Shortly, however, Simon receives a special-delivery letter offering him a job as a [[professors in the United States|professor]] of agriculture at the State Agricultural and Mechanical (A&amp;M) Institute for Negroes, in [[Normal, Alabama|Normal]], [[Alabama]]. (The school later becomes renamed as the [[Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University|Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical (A&amp;M) University]]; the campus and the former town of Normal, named for the [[normal school]] established there, now lie within the city limits of [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]].)

Simon promptly and joyfully accepts his appointment, and he and his family move to Normal in their Chevrolet four-door sedan.

Not only does Prof. Haley teach his students in the [[classroom]]s and [[laboratory|laboratories]], but he also approaches the local farmers and, with little success, tells them about techniques which would enable them to replenish the soil and to produce better crops, using simple techniques, such as [[crop rotation]]. He meets Lyle Pettijohn ([[Robert Culp]]), the [[county (United States)|county]] agricultural agent and a son of a sharecropper in [[Greene County, Tennessee|Greene County]], Tennessee, so the two of them easily find mutual interests and objectives.

However, both Simon and Pettijohn meet resistance and incite violent reprisals by the white landowners.

Soon afterward Will dies in Henning.

While Bertha is out of town with the two younger sons for the funeral, Simon and Alex spend some special time together, during which Simon says to him, "There's one thing poor people have in common no matter who they are, they have no education. Education is the key; it's the way up, the way out. That's why you must do well in school Alex, not only for yourself but to help others as well".

In May 1933 Bertha starts to show subtle signs of a threatening illness, and those symptoms continue during a summer [[vacation]] with the aging Cynthia ([[Beah Richards]]) in Henning.

When Simon and his family return to Normal, they find that his antagonists have broken in, damaged their home, and destroyed much of their property.

One afternoon Simon returns to his home and learns that Bertha has experienced a relapse in her illness, and that her condition has become serious. Minutes later, because of internal bleeding due to an undisclosed problem, Bertha dies in Simon's arms while Alex watches.

Soon Simon drives his three sons to Henning, where the boys move into the bungalow with Cynthia and Elizabeth. On the front porch of the bungalow Alex listens to Cynthia, Elizabeth, and sometimes Cousin Georgia, while they retell the stories about Kunta Kinte, Kizzy, Chicken George, Tom, and the others.

Shortly afterward Grandma Cinthy shows Alex a large cross-section disc cut from the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a [[Sequoioideae|redwood tree]] in [[California]], and she explains it to him. Will has marked the annual rings of the trunk in such a way as to indicate the years when various relatives had been born, and when several major world events had occurred.

===Chapter 5 – World War II===
On May 1, 1939, seven years later, at age 17 Alex ([[Damon Evans (actor)|Damon Evans]]) arrives in [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina|Elizabeth City]], North Carolina, where Simon now lives with Zeona ([[Diahann Carroll]]), his second wife, and where he now teaches agriculture at the Elizabeth City State Teachers College (a black school, later renamed as the [[Elizabeth City State University]]). Alex promptly sees that Zeona is pregnant. Although he was bright enough to enter college at age 15, his academic work has become so lackluster and mediocre that he has dropped out of the Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical (A&amp;M) College (another black school, later renamed as the [[Alcorn State University]]), near [[Lorman, Mississippi|Lorman]], [[Mississippi]]. Simon strongly encourages Alex to enlist in one of the branches of the armed forces, in the expectation that two or three years of military life will cause and allow him to gain maturity.

In August 1939 Alex enlists in the [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Virginia]], and he reports directly aboard a [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]], [[USCGC Mendota (WHEC-69)|USCGC ''Mendota'' (WHEC-69)]], without receiving the benefit of any [[recruit training|boot camp]] or other basic training. However, Percival "Scotty" Scott ([[John Hancock (actor)|John Hancock]]), a gruff but kindly steward's mate [[United States Coast Guard#Enlisted Personnel|first-class]], the leading [[petty officer#United States|petty officer]] in the [[wardroom]] area among the mess attendants and steward's mates, takes Alex in tow. Alex begins as a mess attendant, starting on the career path toward his becoming a steward's mate, one of the few ratings available to black [[enlisted rank|enlisted men]] in either the [[United States Navy|Navy]] or the Coast Guard during the era of [[World War II]] (WW2). (The real USCGC ''Mendota'' (WHEC-69) served 1945-73.)

While attending a church-sponsored dance for servicemen and local ladies, Alex meets Nan Branch ([[Debbie Allen]]), a timid, attractive, naïve, single young woman, and they continue to meet at the church dances. On the eighth such meeting Alex proposes marriage to Nan, and she accepts. They soon marry, then they visit Simon, Zeona, and their new baby, in Elizabeth City. Simon expresses disapproval because Alex has departed from his plan for him, and Zeona urges Simon to stop interfering.

Meanwhile, on December 7, 1941 the [[Empire of Japan]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacks the USA]] at [[Pearl Harbor]] in the [[Territory of Hawaii]], thus drawing the US into the new war. By this time Scotty has advanced to the rate of [[Chief Petty Officer (United States)|chief petty officer]] (chief steward's mate).

By July 1942 Alex and Chief Scott are somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean aboard [[USS Murzim (AK-95)|USS ''Murzim'' (AK-95)]], an [[ammunition ship]], one of several Naval vessels manned by Coast Guard crews during WW2. Scotty asks Alex why he receives so many letters, and he answers, in effect, that, if he wishes to receive letters, then he must write letters – to friends and relatives back home. Then, at Scotty's request, Alex writes a [[love letter]] for Scotty to a [[girlfriend]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], where the ship will make a port visit about two months later. The letter works so well that Scotty sets up Alex to write love letters for other shipmates for one [[dollar]] apiece. Thus Alex enters the writing business. (The real USS ''Murzim'' (AK-95) served 1943-46.)

While at sea Alex receives the news that Nan has given birth to a girl, and that she has given her mother's name, Lydia, to their baby. Alex expresses his pleasure about his new [[father]]hood, yet he says that he had wanted to give the girl the name of Cynthia, his maternal grandmother.

World War II ends, and both Simon and Alex start thinking about their respective plans for Alex. Simon makes a train journey to California, where he meets Alex at the Coast Guard Station on [[Yerba Buena Island]], in the [[San Francisco Bay]]. Alex has advanced to the rate of petty officer first-class (steward's mate first-class). Simon and Alex articulate a sharp disagreement about the differences between their plans for Alex; Simon wants him to return to [[academia]], but Alex intends to stay in the Coast Guard at least until he decides or discovers what else he should do. (Simon expresses a [[goal|dream]] that Alex might become even a president of a university.)

Alex returns to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and to Nan and Lydia, and Nan again becomes pregnant. Alex requests and gets an assignment in New York City, so that he can live and work closer to the editors there, because of his intense interest in [[writer|writing]] and his goal to become a published [[author]].

===Chapter 6 – Postwar===
In November 1946 he and his family, in their Ford [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]] [[station wagon]], head northward to his next [[military base|duty station]], and they encounter not only [[racial segregation in the United States|racial discrimination]] but also [[frustration]] and [[disappointment]] while seeking a room in a [[motel]] or "auto court". Alex starts working, writing [[press release]]s in the [[public relations|public-relations]] (PR) office of the Coast Guard in [[Manhattan]]. While off duty he starts writing proposed [[article (publishing)|articles]] and submitting them to [[magazine]]s, but he receives only rejection slips.

Cdr. Robert Munroe ([[Andy Griffith]]), the officer in charge of the PR office, a [[Southern United States|Southerner]] with 30 years of experience in [[journalism]], dismisses Alex's early writings as amateur but takes an interest in Alex, his work, and his plans, and he offers him constructive advice and guidance.

Alex continues to work hard on his writing, both on duty and off duty. He spends so much time on his own writing that Nan begins to complain, saying that he neglects her and their two children, Lydia ([[Kim Fields]]) and Billy (Joel Herd), by giving them so little time and attention.

While on [[annual leave]] from the Coast Guard, Alex and his family visit Cynthia, Elizabeth, and Cousin Georgia in the bungalow in Henning, and, partly with the encouragement of Grandma Cinthy, he starts to feel a need or wish to learn more about the [[cultural heritage|roots]] of his [[family]]. (During that visit Cinthy tells Alex that the old slice from the redwood tree has become hauled away to a dump because insects had begun reducing it to sawdust.)

Alex continues to feel much frustration and disappointment about his lack of success in civilian commercial writing.

Alex seeks and in 1949 receives a change of his rating from steward's mate first-class to journalist first-class, and he remains as a journalist (no longer in the wardroom area). Later he advances to the rate of chief petty officer (chief journalist, the first chief journalist in the Coast Guard), and he continues as a chief journalist for the remainder of his 20-year military career.

On Christmas Eve 1950 Mel Klein ([[Milt Kogan]]), an independent writer on an assignment from a magazine editor, consults Alex, to get some [[statistics]] to go into a new article about the Coast Guard, and Alex asks Mel for advice. Mel tells him about [[Coronet (magazine)|''Coronet'']], a small-format magazine (somewhat similar to the ''[[Reader's Digest]]''), which, according to Mel, can't get enough short (600-word) [[human interest story|human-interest stories]].

In response to Mel's advice Alex that same night dives into his work after hours in the office and submerges himself in his writing and rewriting – to the extent that he loses sight of his special duties to his family that special night – to take home the gifts and the [[Christmas tree|tree]], for which Nan and the kids have prepared a place in their [[apartment]], and which they have awaited and anticipated.

Sometime after sunrise on Christmas Day, Alex finally arrives at their apartment – barely in time to see Nan and their children as they walk out and step into a [[taxicab]] – because Nan has decided to leave Alex and to move in with her mother in her home. Nan and Alex later divorce.

===Chapter 7 – The 1960s===
In October 1960 Simon, Alex ([[James Earl Jones]]), George ([[Howard Rollins]]), and others gather in Henning for the funeral of Aunt Lizzie. George is an [[attorneys in the United States|attorney]] and a [[State Senator|state senator]] (and the second black graduate of the [[University of Arkansas School of Law|School of Law]] at the [[University of Arkansas]]), Julius is an [[architect]], and Alex is, as he describes himself, a professional writer with a respectable living. Simon implies that he does not feel as pleased with the accomplishments of Alex as he does with those of his two younger brothers.

In 1960, Alex meets [[Malcolm X]] ([[Al Freeman, Jr.|Al Freeman Jr.]]), and later he interviews him and a number of other notable people, including [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] ([[Marlon Brando]]), while writing for ''[[Playboy]]'' and the ''Reader's Digest''.

Alex, as a co-author, writes also ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'', and he finishes it several weeks before the [[assassination]] of the subject person.

While Alex makes another visit in Henning, Cousin Georgia encourages him and his curiosity about his family heritage, then Alex continues his research – to the [[National Archives Building|National Archives]], a private source in North Carolina, a historical society in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], the headquarters of the [[United Nations]], and eventually to the village of [[Jufureh]] in The Gambia in West Africa. Before Alex leaves for West Africa, Simon reconciles with his son, saying that he is proud of Alex's work on ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X''.

In Jufureh, Alex listens to a native [[griot]] (a tribal oral historian), who tells about a young [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] man, [[Kunta Kinte]], who went out to fetch wood to make a drum and was never again seen. Thus, Alex concludes that he has truly discovered his ancestor and his history in Africa.

===Epilogue===
As with the original, the new series again concludes with a postscript by Alex himself, who encourages viewers to explore their own genealogy, in part by interviewing their older relatives, consulting written records, and holding family reunions.

==Production==
Producers [[Stan Margulies]] and [[David L. Wolper]] were initially reluctant to make a sequel to the 1977 miniseries, but later agreed to do it.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Writer [[Ernest Kinoy]] then originally wrote an outline for ''Roots: The Next Generations'' based on the final seven chapters of Alex Haley's book ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'' and about 1,000 pages worth of family recollections that [[Alex Haley]] dictated into a tape recorder.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

The producers aimed for casting high quality actors, and basically had no trouble signing the people they wanted because of the success of the first miniseries.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; While [[Georg Stanford Brown]] reprises his role as Tom Harvey, [[James Earl Jones]] was selected partially due to his physical resemblance to Haley. Wanting to also participate in the miniseries, [[Marlon Brando]] basically just called out of the blue and asked for a small yet memorable role; he was cast as [[George Lincoln Rockwell]]&lt;ref name=time/&gt; and won an Emmy Award for his performance.

'''Rosie's Theater Kids''', formerly known as '''Rosie's Broadway Kids''', is a non-profit arts education organization started by actress and comedian [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. RTKids was founded in 2003 and continually provides training in dance, music, and drama for students attending New York City public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ROSIE'S THEATER KIDS details|url=https://www.charitybuzz.com/support/rosiestheaterkids|publisher=[[Charitybuzz]]|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is based on the Maravel Arts Center, 445 W. 45th St., in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan]].  The center is named for O'Donnel's teacher Pat Maravel who was instrumental in O'Donnell's interest in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;https://rosiestheaterkids.org/maravel-arts-center/#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Rosie's Theater Kids is an arts education organization dedicated to enriching the lives of children through the arts.
Using professional teaching artists, Rosie's Theater Kids offers classes in dance and music and a professional theater experience for children who might otherwise not have the opportunity.
Its goal is to inspire excellence, motivate learning, uplift the human spirit, and to instill a lifelong appreciation of the arts.

==Programs==

===PS Broadway===

PS Broadway is the RTKids in-school program for NYC public school fifth-
graders. During the year, RTKids staff members teach dance and music as part of a 15-week program that serves 22 schools throughout Manhattan. As part of this program, every class of students takes a free trip to see a Broadway musical and then participates in a question-and-answer session with performers, directors, conductors, and members of the production's technical staff. Each semester this program is wrapped up with a school assembly where the kids can perform for their peers, parents, and teachers.

===ACTE II (A Commitment to Excellence)===

ACTE II is Rosie's Theater Kids scholarship program in which outstanding graduates of PS Broadway get the opportunity to receive further training in free after-school classes in ballet, tap, jazz, voice, and drama. Part of ACTE II is the Summer Intensive: an all-day, Monday through Friday summer program that provides group classes and private lessons, preparing the students for a final performance for family, friends, and industry professionals.

===Spotlight on Fitness===

Developed in collaboration with a school-based health care program and the NYC Department of Education, Spotlight on Fitness (SoFit) is a physical education program that fulfills state and local curriculum requirements in both the arts and physical education.

===A+===

The newest initiative of RTKids, A+ (Arts-Plus) provides supplementary tools to 
enhance the academic achievement of the ACTE II students at the secondary level. This program includes after-school tutoring, High School admission guidance, private coaching and preparation for performing arts school auditions (both high school and collegiate), and professional PSAT and SAT preparatory classes. So far, with the individual coaching and assistance from RTKids, 100% of the 8th grade students were placed in competitive New York City performing arts high schools for the past two years.

==History==
In April 2003, Rosie's Theater Kids was founded by Rosie O'Donnell, Kelli Carpenter, and RBKids Artistic Director, Lori Klinger. Since introducing the program to its first school in Manhattan, RTKids has expanded to serve over 5,000 students at 22 schools in Harlem, Midtown West, Chelsea, Lower East Side, East Village, Chinatown, and Brooklyn.
The ACTE II program has also expanded, with new 5th grade students added annually from PS Broadway classes to a new "team" of students each year. Currently ACTE II has five teams.

The '''Science Picnic''' is Europe's largest outdoor science-popularization event&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url =http://www.pikniknaukowy.pl/2009/en/ |title = www.pikniknaukowy.pl/2009/en/ | accessdate = | author =| authorlink = | date = | publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; organized jointly by [[Polish Radio]] and the [[Copernicus Science Centre]]. It has been held every year since 1997 in Warsaw's New Town Square and Podzamcze area, between 2010 and 2012 in Marszałek Rydz-Śmigły Park, and since 2013 at the [[National Stadium, Warsaw|National Stadium]]. A wide range of research fields are represented at the Picnic, including the hard, [[natural sciences|natural]], and [[social sciences]] together with the [[humanities]]. Research and teaching institutions from Poland and abroad reveal here behind-the-scenes aspects of their work and present science in ways accessible to visitors of various ages, using hands-on experiments and interactive exhibits.

The Science Picnic was commended by the [[European Commission]] in 2005 as one of 10 model European projects in the "Science and Society" field. The event has served as the inspiration for many other popular science initiatives, including the Copernicus Science Centre in Warsaw.

==History==
The first Science Picnic (as Science Picnic of Polish Radio BIS) held on 14 June 1997 at the New Town. Seventeen research and teaching institutions form Warsaw took part in it. Picnic was visited by over 3000 people. In subsequent years, the number of participating institutions and visitors grew rapidly. In 2006, around 150 thousand people came to Picnic and 170 institutions form Poland and abroad participated in it, in 2008 – 217 institutions. Since 2008 Science Picnic is organized jointly by [[Polish Radio]] and the Copernicus Science Centre. Since 2013 Science Picnics are also hold in Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url =http://ipress.ua/articles/kudy_pity_na_vyhidni_28645.html |title = first picnics in Ukraine | accessdate = | author =| authorlink = | date = | publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:London Six Day 1967 Polaroid (23808947444).jpg|thumb|The 1967 edition held at the [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]]]]
The '''Six Days of London''' is a [[Six-day racing|six-day track cycling race]] held annually in [[London]], United Kingdom. 

==History==
A first edition of the event was held in 1903, when 4 couples of riders competed 6 hours per day from 2 to 7 February at [[Alexandra Palace]]. The winning couple, England's [[Tommy Hall (cyclist)|Hall]] and Martin, rode a total amount of 839 miles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sixday.org.uk/html/1903_london.html&lt;/ref&gt; After that edition the Six Days race was not to return until 1923.&lt;ref&gt;http://memoire-du-cyclisme.eu/piste_6jours/6j_londres.php&lt;/ref&gt; The event wasn't held since 1980, but was revived in 2015. 

Between 1936 and 1980 the event was held at the [[Wembley Arena]] on a {{convert|166|m|abbr=on}} temporary track. Since 2015, the event is held at the velodrome of the [[Lee Valley VeloPark]].

Usually divided into programs featuring a nation, region, state or theme, the Festival has featured tradition bearers from more than 90 nations, every region of the United States, scores of ethnic communities, more than 100 [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] groups, and some 70 different occupations.&lt;ref name=mission/&gt;

The Festival generally includes daily and evening programs of music, song, dance, celebratory performance, crafts and cooking demonstrations, storytelling, illustrations of workers' culture, and narrative sessions for discussing cultural issues.&lt;ref name=mission/&gt;  Cultural practitioners speak for themselves, with each other, and to the public.&lt;ref name=mission/&gt; Visitors participate, learning, singing, dancing, eating traditional foods, and conversing with people that the Festival program presents.&lt;ref name=mission/&gt;

'''''Tale of Two Mice''''' is a 1945 [[Warner Bros.]] [[cartoon]] in the [[Looney Tunes]] series, directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. It is a sequel to 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]'', with the [[Abbott and Costello]] characterizations ("[[Babbit and Catstello]]") now cast as mice. They are voiced by [[Tedd Pierce]] and [[Mel Blanc]] respectively.

==Plot==
Babbit sends Catstello to get some cheese from the refrigerator putting Catsello in danger and peril with a cat, until finally Catsello obtains a block of cheese. Babbit doesn't want it, as he doesn't like Swiss cheese. Fed up with Babbit's bossiness, Catsello force feeds Babbit the Swiss cheese.

{{George H. W. Bush series}}
As part of the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 United States presidential election]], 
on October 11, 1984, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee for [[Vice President of the United States]], Representative [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee, incumbent Vice President [[George H.W. Bush]], participated in a televised campaign debate.  The debate was the first vice presidential debate to feature a woman and was the only vice presidential debate in the race.  It was moderated by [[Sander Vanocur]] of [[ABC News]] and held at the [[Philadelphia Civic Center]].&lt;ref name="nyt-raines"/&gt; 

==The debate==
===Ferraro's experience===
Ferraro handled a question about her experience at the debate, after being asked how her three House terms stacked up with Bush's two House terms, career as an ambassador to China and the United Nations, [[Director of Central Intelligence]] and four years as Vice President.  The peak of the experience battle came when, during a discussion of the [[Carter administration]] in [[Iran]] and the [[Reagan administration]] in [[Lebanon]], Bush said, "Let me help you with the difference, Mrs. Ferraro, between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon."&lt;ref name="nyt-raines"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F00E1EFB3D5D0C718DDDA90994DC484D81 | title=Bush and Ferraro Debate: Disagree About Leadership, Foreign Policy and Religion | author=[[Howell Raines]] | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1984-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferraro responded to cap what ''[[The New York Times]]'' termed "a bristling exchange",&lt;ref name="nyt-raines"/&gt; "Let me just say first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy."&lt;ref name="hdpe"/&gt;

===Views on abortion===
As a [[Roman Catholic]], Ferraro came under fire from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for being [[pro-choice]] on [[abortion]], a position in conflict with [[Religion and abortion#Roman Catholicism|Catholic moral doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923636,00.html "Pressing the Abortion Issue"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', September 24, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; She strongly defended her position at the debate, which earned her audience applause and a respectful reply from her opponent. Bush was attacked for his change in views since 1980, his transition from [[pro-choice]] to [[pro-life]].&lt;ref name="debatetranscript"&gt;{{cite web | title=The 1984 Vice Presidential Debate | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/84debates/vp2.html | publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] | date=1984-10-11 | accessdate=2007-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central America===
Ferraro said, "We're not moving toward a more secure area of the world," in regards to [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]], stating that both [[Sandinista]] soldiers levels and Soviet and Cuban advisors levels had increased during the Reagan years.  She also criticized the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua as a violation of international law.&lt;ref name="debatetranscript"/&gt;

===Voting Rights Act===
When Ferraro criticized Reagan's actions of refusing to support, and later signing, the [[Voting Rights Act]] the moderator, Sander Vancour, cut her off in order to ask the enthusiastically applauding audience to calm down.

==Aftermath==
The result was proclaimed mostly even by newspapers, television, other media, and historians.&lt;ref name="hdpe"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Nelson, Michael | title=Historic Documents on Presidential Elections 1787–1988 | publisher=[[Congressional Quarterly, Inc.]] | year=1991 | isbn=0-87187-607-8}} pp. 785ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apce"&gt;{{cite book | last=Scala | first=Dante, J. |editor=Shade, William |editor2=Campbell, Ballard C. | title=American Presidential Campaigns and Elections | publisher=[[M.E. Sharpe Inc.]] | year=2003 | isbn=0-7656-8042-4}} p. 966.&lt;/ref&gt;  Women voters tended to think Ferraro had won, while men, Bush.&lt;ref name="light-lake"&gt;{{cite book | last=Light | first=Paul C. |author2=Lake, Celinda  | chapter=The Election: Candidates, Strategies and Decisions | title=The Elections of 1984 | editor=Nelson, Michael (ed.) | publisher=[[Congressional Quarterly, Inc.]] | year=1985 | isbn=0-87187-330-3}} pp. 103, 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some media, however, either declared Bush or Ferraro the winner. The candidates were both praised for their ability to debate.

During a campaign event the next day, an open microphone caught Bush bragging that "we tried to kick a little ass last night" in the debate. That remark itself became a campaign issue with Ferraro's camp considering it inappropriate and demanding an apology while the Bush team dismissed it as an expression familiar to those having played sports in the state of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times October 14 1984 Gerald M Boyd&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Weiße Rose''''' (''White Rose'')&lt;ref group=N name=N&gt;The title of the opera is often shown as ''Die Weiße Rose''; however, the publisher, [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]], shows both versions as [http://www.breitkopf.com/search/1113?sr.query=Die+Wei%C3%9Fe+Rose ''Weiße Rose''].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[chamber opera]] in one act by [[Udo Zimmermann]]. The opera tells the story of [[Hans Scholl|Hans]] and [[Sophie Scholl]], a brother and sister in their early twenties, who were guillotined by the [[Nazis]] in 1943 for leading [[White Rose|Die Weiße Rose]], a non-violent resistance group. The opera premiered at the [[Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden|Dresden Conservatory]] on 17 June 1967 with a German [[libretto]] by the composer's brother, {{ill|Ingo Zimmermann|de}}, a well known [[journalist]] and writer in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120303003429/http://www.zeit.de/1975/13/Sone-und-solche Zeit Online] &lt;/ref&gt; The opera was received fairly well. Zimmermann revised it the following year for a professional production in [[Schwerin]].

A completely new and less conventionally narrative opera with {{ill|Weiße Rose (Zimmermann, 1986)|de|Weiße Rose (Zimmermann, 1986)|lt=the same title}} and a libretto by Wolfgang Willaschek was premiered at the [[Hamburg State Opera]] on 27 February 1986 and was a success with both audience and critics.

A '''world's fair''', '''world fair''', '''world expo''', '''universal exposition''', or '''international exposition''' (sometimes '''expo''' or '''Expo''' for short) is a large international exhibition designed to showcase achievements of nations. These exhibitions vary in character and are held in different parts of the world. The most recent international exhibition, [[Expo 2017]], was held in [[Astana]], [[Kazakhstan]]. [[Osaka]] in [[Japan]] has been selected to host World Expo 2025.

Since the 1928 ''Convention Relating to International Exhibitions'' came into force, the [[Bureau of International Expositions|Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE; {{lang-en|International Bureau of Exhibitions}}) has served as an international sanctioning body for world's fairs. Four types of international exhibition are organised under the auspices of the BIE: World Expos, Specialized Expos, Horticultural Expos (regulated by the [[AIPH|International Association of Horticultural Producers]]) and the Triennale di Milano. Depending on their category, international exhibitions may last from three weeks to six months.

==History==
{{Further|List of world expositions|List of world's fairs}}
World's fairs originated in the French tradition of national exhibitions, a tradition that culminated with the [[French Industrial Exposition of 1844]] held in [[Paris]]. This fair was followed by other national exhibitions in [[continental Europe]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The best-known 'first World Expo' was held in [[The Crystal Palace]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[London]], United Kingdom, in 1851, under the title "Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations". [[The Great Exhibition]], as it is often called, was an idea of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], [[Queen Victoria]]'s husband, and is usually considered to be the first international exhibition of manufactured products. It influenced the development of several aspects of society, including art-and-design education, international trade and relations, and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Davies in Findling and Pelle (2008), "Encyclopedia of World's Fairs and Expositions", pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; These events have resulted in a remarkable form of Prince Albert's life history, one that continues to be reflected in London architecture in a number of ways, including in the [[Albert Memorial#Statue of Albert|Albert Memorial]] later erected to the Prince. This expo was the most obvious precedent for the many international exhibitions, later called ''world's fairs'', that have continued to be held to the present time.

Since their inception in 1851, the character of World Expos has evolved. Three eras can be distinguished: the era of industrialization, the era of cultural exchange, and the era of nation branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 2004|title= Three eras of World Expositions: 1851–present. |journal= Cosmopolite: Stardust World Expo &amp; National Branding Newsletter |issue= 5|page= 1&lt;!--2--&gt;|location= Amsterdam|publisher= Stardust New Ventures|editor1-first= Tjaco |editor1-last= Walvis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrialization (1851–1938)===
The first era could be called the era of "industrialization" and covered, roughly, the period from 1800 to 1938. In these days, world expositions were especially focused on trade, and were famous for the display of technological inventions and advancements. World expositions were the platforms where the state-of-the-art in science and technology from around the world were brought together. The world expositions of [[The Great Exhibition|1851 London]], [[Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations|1853 New York]], [[1862 International Exhibition|1862 London]], [[Centennial Exposition|1876 Philadelphia]], [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Paris]], [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 Chicago]], [[Brussels International Exposition (1897)|1897 Brussels]], [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris]], [[Pan-American Exposition|1901 Buffalo]], [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|1904 St. Louis]], [[PPIE|1915 San Francisco]], and [[Century of Progress|1933–34 Chicago]] were landmarks in this respect.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}  Inventions such as the [[telephone]] were first presented during this era. An important part of the image of world's fairs stems from this first era.

===Cultural exchange (1939–1987)===
[[File:Ice Follies at 1962 Worlds Fair 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ice Follies]] at the [[Century 21 Exposition|Seattle 1962 World's Fair]]]]
{{Further|Technological utopianism}}

The [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939–40 New York World's Fair]] diverged from the original focus of the world's fair expositions. From then on, world's fairs adopted specific cultural themes; they forecast a better future for society. Technological innovations were no longer the primary exhibits at fairs. The theme of the 1939 fair was "Building the World of Tomorrow"; at the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964–65 New York World's Fair]], it was "Peace Through Understanding"; at the [[Expo 67|1967 International and Universal Exposition]] in Montreal, it was "Man and His World". The fairs encouraged effective [[intercultural communication]] for the exchange of innovation.

The 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal was promoted under the name ''Expo 67''. Event organizers retired the term ''world's fair'' in favor of ''Expo''. (The [[Montreal Expos]], a former [[Major League Baseball]] team, was named for the 1967 fair.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

===Nation branding (1988–present)===
From [[World Expo 88]] in [[Brisbane]] onwards, countries started to use expos more widely and more strongly as a platform to improve their national images through their pavilions. [[Finland]], [[Japan]], [[Canada]], [[France]], and [[Spain]] are cases in point. A large study by Tjaco Walvis called "Expo 2000 Hanover in Numbers" showed that improving [[Nation branding|national image]] was the primary participation goal for 73% of the countries at [[Expo 2000]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In a world where a strong national image is a key asset, pavilions became advertising campaigns, and the Expo a vehicle for "nation branding". Apart from cultural and symbolic reasons, organizing countries (and the cities and regions hosting them) also utilize the world exposition to brand themselves. According to branding expert [[Wally Olins]], [[Spain]] used [[Seville Expo '92|Expo '92]] and the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]] in the same year to underline its new position as a modern and democratic country and present itself as a prominent member of the [[European Union]] and the global community.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

At [[Expo 2000]] Hannover, where countries created their own architecture, the average pavilion investment was about €12 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bayareaeconomy.org/media/files/pdf/Expo_Report_sml.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813060823/http://www.bayareaeconomy.org/media/files/pdf/Expo_Report_sml.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given these costs, governments are sometimes hesitant to participate, because benefits are often assumed not to outweigh the costs. Tangible effects are difficult to measure, but an independent study for the Dutch pavilion at Expo 2000 estimated that the pavilion (which cost around €35 million) generated around €350 million of potential revenues for the Dutch economy. It also identified several key success factors for world-exposition pavilions in general.&lt;ref&gt;Tjaco Walvis (2003), "Building Brand Locations", Corporate Reputation Review, Vol.5, No.4, pp. 358–366&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:1904 worlds fair boer war program.jpg|thumb|[[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis 1904 World's Fair]] Boer War program. Battle recreations took 2–3 hours and included several Generals and 600 veteran soldiers from both sides of the war.  At the conclusion of the show, the [[Boer]] General [[Christiaan de Wet]] would escape on horseback by leaping from a height of {{convert|35|ft|m}} into a pool of water.]]

Presently, there are two types of international exhibition: World Expos (formally known as International Registered Exhibitions) and Specialised Expos (formally known as International Recognised Exhibitions).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/expos/about-expos/expo-categories&lt;/ref&gt; World Expos, previously known as universal expositions, are the biggest category events. At World Expos, participants generally build their own pavilions. They are therefore the most extravagant and most expensive expos. Their duration may be between six weeks and six months. Since 1995, the interval between two World Expos has been at least five years. The latest World Expo [[Expo 2015]] was held in Milan, Italy, from 1 May to 31 October 2015.

Specialized Expos are smaller in scope and investments and generally shorter in duration; between three weeks and three months. Previously, these Expos were called Special Exhibitions or International Specialized Exhibitions but these terms are no longer used officially. Their total surface area must not exceed 25 ha and organizers must build pavilions for the participating states, free of rent, charges, taxes and expenses. The largest country pavilions may not exceed 1,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Only one Specialised Expo can be held between two World Expos.&lt;ref&gt;Based on: [[Bureau International des Expositions|BIE]] Convention&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional two types of international exhibition may be recognized by the BIE: horticultural exhibitions, which are joint [[Bureau International des Expositions|BIE]] and AIPH-sanctioned 'garden' fairs in which participants present gardens and garden pavilions; and the semi-regular [[Milan Triennial]] (not always held every third year) art and design exhibition, held in [[Milan, Italy]], with the BIE granting official international exhibition status to 14 editions of the Triennale between 1996 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/expo-timeline/expo-timeline-triennale&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Expos===
World Expos (formally known as International Registered Exhibitions) encompass universal themes that affect the full gamut of human experience, and international and corporate participants are required to adhere to the theme in their representations.  Registered expositions are held every 5 years because they are more expensive as they require total design of pavilion buildings from the ground up. As a result, nations compete for the most outstanding or memorable structure—recent examples include [[Japan]], [[France]], [[Morocco]], and [[Spain]] at [[Seville Expo '92|Expo '92]]. Recent Registered Expositions include [[Brussels]] [[Expo '58]], [[Montreal]] [[Expo 67]], [[Vancouver]] [[Expo 86]], [[Osaka]] [[Expo '70]], and [[Seville]] [[Seville Expo '92|Expo '92]]. Sometimes prefabricated structures are also used to minimize costs for developing countries or for countries from a geographical block to share space (i.e. Plaza of the Americas at Seville '92).

The only Registered (Universal) exposition to be held without BIE approval was the 1964–1965 New York World's Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/futuristic-photos-from-1964-worlds-fair-2014-4 |title=15 Gorgeous Retro-Future Photos From The 1964 World's Fair |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |author=Harrison Jacobs |date=22 April 2014 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sanctioning organization at Paris denied them "official" status because its president, [[Robert Moses]], did not comply with BIE rules in place at the time, namely the one limiting the duration for universal expositions to six months only. The two World's Fairs in New York (1939–40 and 1964–65) and the Century of Progress in Chicago (1934-1935) have the distinction of being the only two-year world expositions in history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  The Fair proceeded without BIE approval and turned to tourism and trade organizations to host national pavilions in lieu of official government sponsorship. However, a large number of countries did participate in the world's fair including several newly independent African and Asian states.&lt;ref&gt;Findling and Pelle, ''Encyclopedia of World's Fairs and Expositions'', 9780786434169 p330&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick Pittera, a producer of international fairs and exhibitions and author of the history of world's fairs in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and ''Compton Encyclopedia'', was commissioned by Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.]] of New York City in 1959 to prepare the first feasibility studies for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Pittera was joined in his study by Austrian architect [[Victor Gruen]] (Inventor of the '[[Shopping Mall]]'). The Eisenhower Commission ultimately awarded the world's fair bid to New York City against several major U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nywf64.com/building04.html |title=Building the Fair – Five Men |publisher=nywf64.com |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century the BIE has moved to sanction expos only every five years; following the numerous expos of the 1980s and 1990s, some see this as a means to cut down potential expenditure by participating nations. The move was also seen by some as an attempt to avoid conflicting with the [[Summer Olympics]]. The rule may apply to all expos, or it may end up that universal expositions will be restricted to every five years or so, with international or specialized expositions in the in-between years for countries wishing to celebrate a special event. The most recent universal expo was [[Expo 2017]] in [[Astana]].

===Specialised Expos ===
[[File:Expo 2012 Yeosu panoramic view.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Panoramic view of [[Expo 2012|Expo 2012 Yeosu]]]]
Specialized Expos (formally known as International Recognized Exhibitions) are usually united by a precise theme — such as 'Future Energy' ([[Expo 2017]] [[Astana]]), 'The Living Ocean and Cost' ([[Expo 2012]] [[Yeosu]], or 'Leisure in the Age of Technology' ([[Brisbane]], [[Expo '88]]). Such themes are more specific than the wider scope of world expositions.

The Specialized Exposition, Tsukuba, Japan, popularly known as [[Expo '85]] was held in the city of Tsukuba located near Tokyo. This Exposition is more formally known as "The International Science Technology Exposition".

Specialized  Expos are usually smaller in scale and cheaper to run for the host committee and participants because the architectural fees are lower and they only have to customize pavilion space provided free of charge from the Organiser, usually with the prefabricated structure already completed. Countries then have the option of 'adding' their own colours, design etc. to the outside of the prefabricated structure and filling in the inside with their own content.

==Legacy==
[[File:Seattle world fair stamp.jpg|thumb|The iconic Space Needle and Monorail depicted on this 1962 stamp are survivors.]]

The majority of the structures are temporary and are dismantled after the fair closes. Landmark towers from several fairs are notable exceptions. By far the most famous of these is the [[Eiffel Tower]], built for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]]. Although it is now the most recognized symbol of its host city [[Paris]], a number of influential contemporary critics opposed its construction, and there were demands for it to be dismantled after the fair's conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Controversy about the Eiffel Tower|url=http://paris-eiffel-tower-news.com/eiffel-tower-stories/eiffel-tower-controversy.htm|website=Paris Eiffel Tower News|accessdate=3 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305103625/http://paris-eiffel-tower-news.com/eiffel-tower-stories/eiffel-tower-controversy.htm|archive-date=5 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major structures that were held over from these fairs:
* 1851: [[The Crystal Palace]], from the first World's Fair in London, designed so that it could be recycled to recoup losses, was such a success that it was moved and intended to be permanent, only to be destroyed by a fire in 1936.&lt;ref name="burning"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wardsbookofdays.com/1december.htm|accessdate=19 June 2014|title=Crystal Palace: Joseph Paxton – Transported by moving company}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1876: The [[Centennial Exposition]]'s main building, [[Memorial Hall (Philadelphia)|Memorial Hall]], is still in [[Fairmount Park]], [[Philadelphia]], and serving as the new home for the [[Please Touch Museum]]. The space under the entrance to [[Memorial Hall (Philadelphia)|Memorial Hall]] houses a scale model of the entire Exposition.
* 1880: The [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]]-listed [[Royal Exhibition Building]] in [[Melbourne]], constructed for the [[Melbourne International Exhibition (1880)|Melbourne International Exhibition]].
* 1893: The [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago]] is housed in the former Palace of Fine Arts, one of the last remaining buildings of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. In conjunction with the fair, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] building was built to house conferences, as the World's Congress Auxiliary Building.  The intent or hope was to make all Columbian structures permanent, but most of the structures burned, possibly the result of arson during the [[Pullman Strike]]. The foundation of the world's first [[Ferris wheel]], which operated at the Exposition, was unearthed on the [[Midway Plaisance|Chicago Midway]] during a construction project by [[University of Chicago|the University of Chicago]], whose campus now surrounds the Midway. Relocated survivors include the Norway pavilion, a small house now at a museum in Wisconsin, and the Maine State Building, now at the Poland Springs Resort in Maine.
* 1894: The [[Japanese Tea Garden (San Francisco, California)|Japanese Tea Garden]] in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] is the last major remnant of the [[California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894|California Midwinter International Exposition]].&lt;!--Note that the De Young Museum building stripped of its exterior ornament circa 1940, damaged in the 1989 quake, then demolished in 2001 was NOT the Fine Arts Building from the 1894 fair, which was badly damaged in the 1906 quake, but a completely different circa 1920 replacement.--&gt; Large ornamental wooden gates and a pagoda from the 1915 [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] were brought in after the latter fair closed,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130221082642/http://home.comcast.net/~sgsanders/pages/remnants6.html PPIE Found Remnants: Architecture: Japanese Gates and Pagoda.] Retrieved 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; making the Tea Garden a rare if not unique instance of a survivor that incorporates architectural features from two completely separate fairs.
* 1897: A full-scale replica of the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon]] was built for the [[Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition]] where it stands today in [[Nashville]]’s [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]]. It features plaster reproductions of the [[Elgin Marbles]] and, in 1990, a re-creation of the original [[Athena Parthenos]] statue was installed inside just as it was in the original [[Parthenon]] in ancient Greece.
* 1900: the [[Grand Palais]] and [[Petit Palais]].
* 1901: The New York State pavilion at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] remains today as the home of the [[Buffalo History Museum]], and is set on grounds originally laid out by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. Across the man-made lake on the [[Scajaquada Creek]] is the [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]], originally intended as the Beaux Arts Exhibition Hall, but not completed in time for the exhibition.
* 1904: The [[St. Louis Art Museum]] in [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park]], originally the Palace of the Fine Arts, and [[Brookings Hall]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], are remnants of the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (held a year late, as it was originally intended to be the centennial of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]), better known as the St. Louis World's Fair. The aviary in Forest Park gave root to the [[St. Louis Zoo]].
* 1906: The [[Civic Aquarium of Milan]] built for the [[Milan International (1906)|Milan Exposition]] is still open after 100 years and was recently renovated. The [[International Commission on Occupational Health]] (ICOH) was settled in Milan during the fair and had its first congress in the Expo pavilions. In June 2006 the ICOH celebrated the first century of its life in Milan. An elevated railway with trains running at short intervals linked the fair to the city center. It was dismantled in the 1920s.
* 1909: The landscaping (by the Olmsted brothers) from the [[Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition]] (AYPE) in Seattle still forms much of the [[University of Washington]] campus. The only major building left from the AYPE, Architecture Hall, is used by the university's architecture school.
* 1915: The [[Palace of Fine Arts]] in [[San Francisco]] and its adjacent artificial lagoon are the only major remnants of the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] still in their original locations on the former fairgrounds (now the city's [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina District]] neighborhood), but the building is almost entirely a reconstruction. The plaster-surfaced original, not intended to survive after the fair, was a crumbling ruin in 1964 when all but the steel framework was demolished so that it could be reproduced in concrete. The San Francisco Civic Auditorium, now the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium]], is another major legacy of the fair but was built off-site in the city's [[Civic Center, San Francisco|Civic Center]]. The independent [[Panama-California Exposition]] in [[San Diego]] left a substantial legacy of permanent buildings and other structures which today define its site, San Diego's central [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]], including the Prado walkway, the California Tower and Dome (now home to the [[San Diego Museum of Man|Museum of Man]]), the 1500-foot Cabrillo Bridge, the lily pond and botanical gardens, and the [[Spreckels Organ Pavilion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.balboapark.org/info/history | title=Balboa Park History | accessdate=16 May 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60HjFwpkV?url=http://www.balboapark.org/info/history | archivedate=19 July 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1929: Much survives from the two simultaneous fairs [[Spain]] hosted in that year. Most famous are the remnants of the [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929|Ibero-American Exposition]] in [[Seville]], in which the Spanish Pavilion's ''Plaza de España'' forms part of a large park and forecourt. Most of that fair's pavilions have survived and been adapted for other uses, with many of them becoming [[consulate-general|consulates-general]] for the countries that built them. The [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|Barcelona International Exposition]] featured the famous [[Barcelona Pavilion|German pavilion]] designed by [[Mies van der Rohe]], which was demolished but later recreated on the original site.&lt;ref&gt;Expo, International Expositions 1851–2010, Anna Jackson, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1942: A special case is the [[Esposizione Universale Roma|EUR]] quarter in [[Rome]], built for a World's Fair planned for 1942 but cancelled because of [[World War II]]. Today it hosts various offices, both governmental and private, and several museums.
* 1958: In [[Brussels]], the [[Atomium]] still stands at the exposition site. It is a 165-billion-times-enlarged iron-crystal-shaped building. Until June 2012, the "American Theatre" on the Expo grounds was frequently used as a television studio by the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]].
[[File:Seattle - Worlds Fair sign at 47th and Aurora, 1962.gif|thumb|[[Seattle]] – World's Fair sign at 47th and Aurora, 1962]]
* 1962: The [[Space Needle]], theme building of the [[Century 21 Exposition]] commonly known as the Seattle World's Fair, still stands as [[Seattle]]'s iconic landmark. The [[Seattle Center Monorail]], the other widely known "futuristic" feature of the fair, still operates daily. The US pavilion became the [[Pacific Science Center]].
* 1964: The [[Unisphere]], built for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|second New York World's Fair]], still stands on its original site in Flushing Meadows, Queens, New York City. Also surviving are the building housing the [[New York State Museum]], and the former [[Singer Bowl]], since converted into [[Louis Armstrong Stadium]], part of the [[Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]], site of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]].
* 1967: Among the structures still standing from Expo 67 in Montreal are [[Moshe Safdie]]'s [[Habitat 67]], [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s American pavilion the "[[Montreal Biosphère|Montreal Biosphere]]," and the French pavilion (now the [[Montreal Casino]]).
* 1968: San Antonio kept the [[Tower of the Americas]], the Institute of Texan Cultures and the Convention Center from HemisFair '68.
* 1974: [[Spokane]] still has its [[Riverfront Park (Spokane)|Riverfront Park]] that was created for Expo '74—the park remains a popular and iconic part of Spokane's downtown.
* 1982: The [[Sunsphere]] from the [[1982 World's Fair|Knoxville World's Fair]] remains as a feature of [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]'s skyline.
* 1984: The main pavilions of the [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition|1984 New Orleans]] World's Fair became the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, which is also known for its use as a shelter of last resort during Hurricane Katrina.
* 1986: In [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], many [[Expo 86]] projects were designed as legacy projects. Of note are the [[Skytrain (Vancouver)|Skytrain]], [[Science World at TELUS World of Science|Science World]] and [[Canada Place]].
* 1988: The [[The Skyneedle, Brisbane|Skyneedle]], the symbol tower of [[Expo '88]] in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, still stands. Other survivors are the [[Nepal Peace Pagoda]] of the Nepalese representation, now at the transformed World Expo '88 site South Bank Parklands, and the Japan Pond and Garden from the Japanese representation, now at the Brisbane Mount Cooth-tha Botanic Gardens. In 2018 the World Expo 88 Art Trail was re-birthed and dramatically expanded as part of the 30th Anniversary of World expo 88, now forming a Major tourist attraction in its own right. See https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/facilities-recreation/arts-culture/public-art/public-art-trails/world-expo-88-public-art-trail-30th-anniversary 
* 1992: The pavilions of [[Seville Expo '92|Expo '92]] in Seville had been converted into a technological square and a [[theme park]].
* 1998: The main buildings of [[Expo '98]] in [[Lisbon]] were completely integrated into the city itself and many of the art exhibition pieces still remain.
* 2005: The home of Satsuki &amp; Mei Kusakabe, built for the 2005 Expo in [[Aichi]], remains operating at its original site in Morikoro Park and is a popular tourist attraction.
* 2010: The [[China pavilion at Expo 2010|China pavilion]] from [[Expo 2010]] in Shanghai, the largest display in the history of the World Expo, is now the [[China Art Museum]], the largest art museum in Asia.
* 2015: The Italian Pavilion of Expo 2015 remains on the original site.

The Brussels [[Expo '58]] relocated many pavilions within [[Belgium]]: the pavilion of Jacques Chocolats moved to the town of [[Diest]] to house the new town swimming pool. Another pavilion was relocated to [[Willebroek]] and has been used as dance hall Carré&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carre.be |title=Home – Carré |publisher=Carre.be |date= |accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ever since. One smaller pavilion still stands on the boulevard towards the [[Atomium]]: the restaurant "Salon 58" in the pavilion of Comptoir Tuilier.

Many exhibitions and rides created by [[Walt Disney]] and his [[Walt Disney Imagineering|WED Enterprises]] company for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] (which was held over into 1965) were moved to [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] after the closing of the Fair. Many of the rides, including "[[it's a small world]]", and "[[Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln]]", as well as the building that housed the Carousel of Progress are still in operation.

Disney had contributed so many exhibits to the New York fair in part because the corporation had originally envisioned a "permanent World's Fair" at the Flushing site. That concept instead came to fruition with the Disney theme park [[Epcot]], an extension of the [[Walt Disney World Resort]], near [[Orlando, Florida]]. Epcot has many of the characteristics of a typical universal exposition: national pavilions, as well as exhibits concerning technology and/or the future, along with more typical amusement park rides. Meanwhile, several of the 1964 attractions, relocated to [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]], have been duplicated at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]].

Occasionally other bits and pieces of the fairs remain.  In the [[New York City]] [[New York City Subway|subway]] system, signs directing people to [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] Meadows, [[Queens]] remain from the 1964–65 event. In the [[Montreal]] subway at least one tile artwork of its theme, "Man and His World", remains.  Also, a seemingly endless supply of souvenir items from fair visits can be found, and in the United States, at least, can often be bought at garage or estate sales.  Many of these events also produced [[postage stamp]]s and commemorative [[coin]]s.  The [[1904 Olympic Games]], officially known as the Games of the III Olympiad, were held in conjunction with the 1904 [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] fair, although no particular tie-in seems to have been made. The [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]] [[Paris]] was also loosely tied to the Olympic Games.
