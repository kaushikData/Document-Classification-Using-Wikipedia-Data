'''Air operations during the [[Greek Civil War]]''' involved primarily the air forces of the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Africa]], and the government of [[Greece]] against ground elements of the [[Ellinikos Laïkos Apeleftherotikos Stratos|ELAS]] and other anti-government forces.

== Arrival of the Royal Air Force ==

The arrival of British forces to Greece in September 1944 brought with it the [[Royal Air Force]].  The airfield at [[Araxos]] became the first foothold, being captured on 23 September 1944 and many airfields around it were secured within a month, including [[Megara]] taken by parachute landings of [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|4 Para]].  Near [[Athens]], [[Alimos|Kalamaki]] ultimately became the center of RAF activity, renamed [[Hassani]] on 1 December 1944, as home for [[No. 337 Wing RAF]], under which operated a number of squadrons:

* [[No. 32 Squadron RAF]] with the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] V
* [[No. 94 Squadron RAF]] with the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] V
* [[No. 108 Squadron RAF]] with the [[Bristol Beaufighter]] VI
* [[No. 216 Squadron RAF]] with the [[C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakota]] IV
* [[No. 221 Squadron RAF]] with the [[Vickers Wellington]] XIII

These were bolstered by the arrival in November 1944 of [[No. 335 Squadron RAF|No. 335 Squadron RHAF]] and [[No. 336 Squadron RAF|No. 336 Squadron RHAF]].  Both of these were Greek manned units within the RAF and would become the first operational units of the Royal [[Hellenic Air Force]]. Both flew the Spitfire VB fighter.

[[Sedes (Thessaloniki), Greece|Sedes]] was opened with the liberation of northern Greece and became the new home for No. 32 Sqn.

On 2 December 1944, tensions over the role of the EAM and ELAS parties in post-war government resulted in demonstration during which British forces opened fire, killing ten civilians.  The response was attacks on police stations and thus RAF units began operations against ELAS and EAM targets, mostly around Athens.  No. 73 Sqn, along with the newly arrived [[No. 94 Squadron RAF]], used their Spitfires on strafing runs and light bombing was undertaken by No. 108 Sqn.  Additional options were gained when a flight of Beaufighters of [[No. 39 Squadron RAF]] were attached to No. 108 Sqn., armed with [[RP-3]] rockets.  These were considered very effective and over the span of two weeks 105 targets (55 buildings, 19 command posts, 10 supply dumps, 2 radio stations, 12 transportation, and 7 artillery) were struck by these aircraft.  The regular aircraft of No. 108 flew 265 sorties during December.  The heavy bombers of No. 221 Sqn were primarily used in supply flights to the Sedes facility as well as various leaflet and illumination missions.  Two actual bombing raids were carried out (both at night).  The Greek Spitfire squadrons did not participate in the attacks, although the newly formed [[No. 13 Squadron RHAF]] did assist in leaflet operations.

The RAF suffered a major blow with the attack by ELAS troops on their facility at [[Kifisia]], which was home to Allied Headquarters Greece, on 19 December 1944.  The [[No. 2933 Squadron RAF Regiment]] defended strongly but was ultimately overrun with the capture of many British prisoners.  No. 221 Sqn. conducted supply drops to these personnel during their march north.  By 7 January 1945, Athens was secured, and a ceasefire negotiated on 11 January.  While some fighting continued, British fighter squadrons were withdrawn by summer 1945.  Hassani continued to be a hub of RAF operations however the arrival of [[No. 252 Wing RAF]] with three [[Douglas Boston]] V equipped units, [[No. 13 Squadron RAF]], [[No. 18 Squadron RAF]], and [[No. 55 Squadron RAF]].

== Formation of the Royal Hellenic Air Force ==

1946 saw the official transfer of Greek manned RAF squadrons into the Royal Hellenic Air Force.  In addition to the aforementioned Nos. 13, 335, and 336 Sqns., these also included the [[No. 355 Squadron RHAF]] with a variety of transport types, including the C-47, [[Avro Anson]], and Wellington and the 345, 346, and 347 Flights using the [[Taylorcraft Auster|Auster AOP]] and other utility aircraft for liaison.

Meanwhile, government opposition was on the rise and the formation of the [[Democratic Army of Greece]] led to the loss of control of much of rural Greece.  The [[Greek National Army]] responded with [[Operation Terminus]], but this was a failure.  March 1948 saw the RHAF enter the action with attacks on landing strips set up by Communist forces to receive aid from [[Albania]] and [[Yugoslavia]].  Involvement by the [[United States]] led to the launch of [[Operation Dawn (1948)|Operation Dawn]] in April 1948, and this was supported by RHAF units with a total of 641 sorties with the loss of one Spitfire plus damage to ten more.  Dakotas were utilized for leaflet and supply operations.  The operation was successful but the withdrawal to northern border regions limited RHAF effectiveness due to a five-mile stop line to avoid an international incident.

== Offensive support by the RHAF ==
[[File:Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldiver aboard USS Sicily (CVE-118) off Piraeus, Greece, in August 1949.jpg|thumb|A Curtiss SB2C is launched from {{USS|Sicily|CVE-118|6}} off Piraeus, in August 1949.]]
[[Operation Coronis]] was launched in July 1948 against enemy forces in the [[Grammos Mountains]] with the support of Nos. 335 and 336 Sqns. operating from [[Yannina]] and [[Kozani]].  Additional aircraft included [[AT-6 Texan]] and [[Auster]] aircraft.  Ultimate results were a draw as anti-government forces withdrew across the border to Albania.  [[No. 337 Squadron RHAF]] had been formed with Spitfire IX aircraft, giving the RHAF three Spitfire units.  For heavier bombing, Dakotas were jury-rigged with racks for bombs up to 500&amp;nbsp;lb each.  RAF [[deHavilland Mosquito]] photo reconnaissance aircraft were reportedly used in the affair.  RHAF flew 3,474 sorties during the operation, suffering one lost Spitfire plus a further 22 damaged.

Operations in September 1948 centered on the [[Vitsi Mountains]] area, and were supported again by the RHAF.  They were marked by better cooperation with GNA units and the first use of [[napalm]], although this was not used heavily.  These operations lasted through the end of the year, bringing the grand total of sorties for 1948 to 8,907 combat and 9,891 transport, with the loss of twelve airmen.  A major attack at [[Florina]] by guerrilla forces was defeated with significant air support by the RHAF.

August 1949 marked the final series of operations against the guerrilla forces, and again the RHAF played a large role in supporting government forces.  In particular, during the final portion of the month, No. 336 Sqn. began employing its newly acquired [[Curtiss SB2C Helldiver]] aircraft, of which 40 had been acquired from the [[United States Navy]].  This operation resulted in the final destruction of opposition military resistance and resulted in a final ceasefire being signed.  During August 826 sorties had been flown dropping 288 tons of bombs and firing 1935 rockets.  Napalm was used again, with 114 such strikes being made.

== Aircraft of the Greek Civil War ==
* '''[[Airspeed Oxford]]''':  A small number of these utility aircraft were used by the RHAF for liaison and transport.
* '''[[Auster]]''':  A ubiquitous light plane of the period, the RHAF used the Auster as an observation and liaison aircraft and for numerous light duties.  Most were A.O.P. 6 models.
* '''[[Avro Anson]]''':  Some of these utility aircraft were employed by the RHAF from the force's formation through the end of the civil war.
* '''[[Bristol Beaufighter]]''':  A heavier ground-attack aircraft, the Beaufighter Mark VIF (and some Mark VIII) was used by No. 108 Sqn. during the early RAF involvement in Greece.  These were replaced by later model Mark X Beaufighters of No. 252 Sqn. later, although they were not heavily used by that point.  The Beaufighters armed with rockets were particularly effective as an early support aircraft in operations during 1945.  The Beaufighter ended its role with the withdrawal of No. 252 Sqn. in 1946.
* '''[[Curtiss SB2C Helldiver]]''':  Forty of these dive bombers were acquired by the RHAF in late 1948 from the [[United States Navy]].  They proved to be the best strike aircraft of the RHAF and played an important role in the final operations to end the civil war.
* '''[[deHavilland Mosquito]]''':  Only a few of these aircraft were utilized by RAF units in Greece, with a small number of Mark XXVI aircraft employed by No. 55 Sqn.  After the withdrawal of RAF units, however, it was reported that Mosquitoes of No. 13 Sqn. conducted reconnaissance during 1948 on behalf of the Greek government.
* '''[[Douglas Boston]]''':  This light bomber was the backbone of the RAF units which maintained a presence in Greece from the end of active operations in 1945 to the withdrawal of the RAF in 1946.
* '''[[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] and Dakota''':  Primary transport of the Allies in the later half of [[World War II]], the Dakota accompanied the RAF to Greece and was heavily used to supply British forces there.  Dakotas comprised the only [[South African Air Force]] aircraft to be operated there.  Many were transferred to the RHAF, as were a number of C-47s from US stocks.  Some were outfitted with crude bomb racks for use on heavier raids.
* '''[[Hawker Hurricane]]''':  A single unit of Hurricane Mark IV aircraft, No. 6 Sqn., deployed with the first RAF units, but was withdrawn before taking a role in the conflict.
* '''[[Martin Baltimore]]''':  A small number of these light bombers were acquired by the RHAF from the RAF and employed by No. 13 Sqn. in general support duties.
* '''[[North American T-6 Texan]] and Harvard''':  Large numbers of these useful aircraft were operated by the RHAF during the civil war.  Most were AT-6 versions from the United States, although a number of the Harvard model from the RAF were acquired as well.  They were useful as liaison, observation, and light strike aircraft and were a critical part of the effectiveness of other Greek strike aircraft during the operations in 1948.
* '''[[Supermarine Spitfire]]''':  Backbone of both the RAF and RHAF during their operations in the war, the Spitfire was operated in both Mark V and Mark IX versions for most of the conflict.  The RHAF did begin receiving some Mark XVI models later in the conflict, while the RAF had operated a number of the Mark XI for photo-reconnaissance.  Heavily used for strafing and later for napalm strikes, the Spitfire lacked range and ammunition in the strike role.  Additionally, it proved more vulnerable to ground fire than the other types operated by the RHAF.
* '''[[Supermarine Walrus]]''':  A single unit of these amphibian aircraft was deployed for mine-spotting duties in the [[Adriatic]].
* '''[[Vickers Wellington]]''':  Past its primary life as a bomber, Wellingtons of the [[RAF Coastal Command]] were deployed to Greece to assist RAF forces there.  They carried out a number of support tasks, including leaflet and bombing missions.  Originally the Mark XIII was used, although some Mark XIV also arrived.  A small number found their way into the Greek inventory.

== Air units of the Greek Civil War ==

=== Royal Air Force ===

The [[Royal Air Force]] maintained a sizable presence in Greece from the liberation of Greece in September 1944 through the creation of the RHAF in 1946.

* [[No. 6 Squadron RAF]]:  Arriving with the first RAF units in October 1944, No. 6 was the only Hurricane squadron in Greece, but was withdrawn during November 1944.
* [[No. 13 Squadron RAF]]:  Along with No. 18 Sqn., operated Boston V light bombers from Hassani from September 1945 to April 1946.
* [[No. 18 Squadron RAF]]:  Part of the relief forces to replace withdrawn RAF units, No. 18 was in Greece from September 1945 to March 1946 with Boston V light bombers.
* [[No. 32 Squadron RAF]]:  Originally at Araxos and Hassani, and later based from Sedes, No. 32 was a primary RAF fighter squadron from its arrival in September 1944 to its departure in February 1945, during which it used the Spitfire VC.
* [[No. 38 Squadron RAF]]:  Only deployed for a short period between October and November 1944, No. 38 operated Wellingtons for support duties.
* [[No. 39 Squadron RAF]]:  Not deploying in full, No. 39 dispatched a flight of six Beaufighter VIF to assist No. 108 Sqn during December 1944.  They were particularly effective due to their rocket armament.
* [[No. 55 Squadron RAF]]:  A third Boston V light bomber squadron deployed to Greece in September 1945, No. 55 remained until November 1946, and also used the Mosquito XXVI.
* [[No. 73 Squadron RAF]]:  Deployed in December 1944 and taking a sizeable role in the fighting around Athens, No. 73 used the Spitfire LF.IX and was withdrawn in January 1945.
* [[No. 94 Squadron RAF]]:  Arriving in October 1944 and flying mainly from Hassani, No. 94 operated heavily in support of British operations around Athens in 1944, being withdrawn in April 1945.  The unit used the Spitfire VB and VC.
* [[No. 108 Squadron RAF]]:  Equipped with the Beaufighter VIF, No. 108 provided the backbone for RAF strike forces during its tenure, lasting from October 1944 through January 1945.
* [[No. 216 Squadron RAF]]:  One of the busier units in Greece, the only Dakota equipped RAF unit operated in Greece from October 1944 through March 1946 performing primarily transport duties.
* [[No. 221 Squadron RAF]]:  A Coastal Command unit equipped with Wellington XIII aircraft, No. 221 was part of the early RAF contingent in Greece and operated in a variety of support roles through its departure in April 1945.
* [[No. 252 Squadron RAF]]:   No. 252 was equipped with more modern Beaufighter X aircraft,   It arrived in October 1944and was among the last RAF forces withdrawn in December 1946.
* [[No. 624 Squadron RAF]]:  An amphibian patrol and transport unit deployed for mine spotting in the Aegean from February to April 1945.
* [[No. 680 Squadron RAF]]:  Deployed during January and February 1945, No. 680 employed Spitfire XI aircraft for photographic reconnaissance.

=== South African Air Force ===

The [[South African Air Force]] had a limited deployment to Greece which was withdrawn shortly before the end of [[World War II]].

* [[40 Squadron SAAF|No. 40 Squadron SAAF]]: This fighter reconnaissance unit detached four pilots (Lieut. H.H. Davison, Lieut. R.T. Joyner, Lieut. N.K. McCallum, and Lieut. A.C. Villiers) to [[Balkan Air Force]] on 9 December 1944, flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire V's]] on loan from [[No. 318 Squadron RAF|No. 318 (Polish) Squadron]]. All four machines were lost making wheels-up landings on [[Zakynthos]] whilst crossing to Greece in stormy weather, but the pilots survived. Flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire V's]] assigned to a grounded Greek-manned squadron, the detachment operated out of [[Hellenikon Air Base|Hassani]] from 13 December 1945 to 5 February 1945 under the direct control of [[Balkan Air Force]].
* [[No. 44 Squadron SAAF]]:  The only full squadron of the SAAF to deploy to Greece, No. 44 was a transport unit with Dakota IV aircraft operating out of Hassani from December 1944 to March 1945.

=== Royal Hellenic Air Force ===

The Royal [[Hellenic Air Force]] was formed from Greek units of the RAF in 1946 and by the end of that year had assumed sole duties from the RAF for the country.

* [[No. 13 Squadron RHAF]]:  Based in Hassani from November 1944 through October 1946, it operated the Baltimore and Wellington on general support and reconnaissance duties.
* [[335th Bomber Squadron (HAF)|No. 335 Squadron RHAF]]:  Originally an RAF unit with Spitfire VB fighters, it operated from Hassani from November 1944, although it was excluded from combat operations during through 1945.  In May 1945 it replaced the role of the withdrawn No. 94 Sqn. as an operational fighter squadron.  The squadron later acquired Mark IX and XVI aircraft.
* [[336th Bomber Squadron (HAF)|No. 336 Squadron RHAF]]:  Originally an RAF unit with Spitfire VB fighters and sister unit to No. 335, it served a training role as well until the withdrawal of No. 94 Sqn., which it replaced alongside No. 335.  The squadron became the sole RHAF operator of the Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldiver when acquired in 1948.
* [[337th Fighter Squadron (HAF)|No. 337 Squadron RHAF]]:  Formed as the third fighter squadron of the RHAF in July 1947, No. 337 was equipped with Spitfire IX (and later XVI) fighters and operated them through the end of the war.
* [[355th Squadron (HAF)|No. 355 Squadron RHAF]]:  Originally an RAF unit with Anson and Wellington aircraft, No. 355 was the primary logistical squadron of the RHAF, adding C-47 aircraft as well.  While most missions were support, some bombing missions were undertaken with modified aircraft.

{{for|the British Olympic shooter|Alan Bray (sport shooter)}}
'''Alan Bray''' (13 October 1948 – 25 November 2001) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[historian]] and [[gay rights]] activist. He was a [[Roman Catholic]] and had a particular interest in [[Christianity]]'s relationship to [[homosexuality]].

==Early life==
Bray was born in Hunslet, Leeds, to a working-class family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aldrich|first=Robert|title=Who's Who in Contemporary Gay and Lesbian History: From World War II to the Present Day|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died when he was 12, an event that profoundly affected his relationships.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|last=Gee|first=Stephen|title=Obituary: Alan Bray|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/dec/18/guardianobituaries.gayrights|accessdate=2 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended secondary school in Leeds, where he met his lifelong partner Graham Wilson. He attended [[Bangor University]] and spent a year at an [[Anglican]] seminary before beginning a career in civil service.

==Gay rights activism==
He became involved with the [[Gay Liberation Front]] in the 1970s and actively campaigned for gay rights.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; His interest in sexual politics influenced his work on history, which culminated in two books. His second book, ''The Friend'', was published posthumously.

==Legacy==
The Roman Catholic Caucus of the Gay and Lesbian Christian Movement, of which Bray was a member, instituted a series of Alan Bray Memorial Lectures on Catholic theology and homosexuality. British historians [[Michael Hunter (historian)|Michael Hunter]], [[Miri Rubin]], and [[Laura Gowing]] co-edited the book ''Love, Friendship and Faith in Europe, 1300–1800'' ([[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2005),  a collection of essays inspired by Bray's idea of finding some universal component of homosexuality within the experiences of intimacy and friendship without "locating a discourse that identifies persons as homosexual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gowing|first=Laura|title=Love, Friendship and Faith in Europe, 1300-1800|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=1-4039-9147-2|author2=Hunter, Michael|author3= Rubin, Miri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Rumens's ''Queer Company: The Role and Meaning of Friendship in Gay Men's Work Lives'' ([[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate]], 2011), is also inspired by Alan Bray's scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Rumens, ''Queer Company: The Role and Meaning of Friendship in Gay Men's Work Lives'', Ashgate, 2011, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in 1936 in the small village of Jadupur in [[Murshidabad]] district in [[West Bengal]], Bagchi received his higher education in [[Presidency College, Kolkata]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], University of Cambridge. In 1963 he was awarded the PhD degree at [[Cambridge University]] for a thesis titled "Private investment and partial planning in India".{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

He is married to the feminist critic and activist [[Jasodhara Bagchi]].

His academic career began when he started teaching in Presidency College, [[Kolkata]]. In the 1960s, he taught in the Faculty of Economics in Cambridge (where he was Fellow of [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]]), but resigned his post in 1969, to resume his academic career in Presidency College, Kolkata.&lt;ref name="idsk.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idsk.org/amiya.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726171113/http://idsk.org/amiya.html |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 he joined the newly founded [[Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta]], which went on to become one of the most productive and globally famous research institutions in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caleidoscop.org/Members/Marius/news-caleidoscop-2009/post-doctoral-fellowship-2009-rabindranath-tagore-centre-for-human-development-studies&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagchi has specialised in the history of Indian banking and finance, and acted as Official Historian of the [[State Bank of India]] (SBI) from 1976 to 1998; he played a leading role in ensuring that the unique archives of SBI are preserved for posterity.&lt;ref name="idsk.org"/&gt;

After retiring as [[Reserve Bank of India]] professor from the [[Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta]] in 2001, he became the founder-director of the [[Institute of Development Studies, Kolkata]],&lt;ref name="idsk.org"/&gt; a multidisciplinary centre of excellence in the [[social sciences]], which is affiliated with the [[University of Calcutta]], and is promoted by the government of West Bengal.&lt;ref name="idsk.org"/&gt; His famous discourse on quasi-capitalist banking has been recognised a masterpiece by [[Bloomberg L.P.]]. He spearheads research in development studies in an array of areas, notably banking and finance, [[public health]], labour studies, [[communication studies|information and communication studies]], [[gender studies]], education, and the sociology of literature.

He has been Visiting Professor in international academic institutions such as [[Cambridge University]], [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]], [[Cornell University]], [[Curtin University]], [[Perth, Western Australia]], [[Naples University]], and [[University of Bristol]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4272">[[File:Ananyino culture axe.jpg|thumb|270px| Bronze Ax 7th-5th C. BC. (National Museum of the Republic of Tatarstan)]]
The '''Ananyino culture''' is an [[archeological culture]] of the late 8th to 3rd centuries BCE in present-day [[Tatarstan]], [[Russian Federation]]. The name comes from the burials first discovered near the village Ananyino (Ананьино) in the vicinity of [[Elabuga]], excavated by P.V.Alabin and I.V.Shishkin in 1858.

It is located in the territory of the Middle [[Volga]] (from the [[Vetluga River]] to the town of [[Ulyanovsk]]) and the [[Kama River]] basin. In the southeast the culture stretches along the lower course of the [[Belaya River (Kama)|Belaya River]], from its mouth up to the town of [[Birsk]] (fortresses Novokabanov, Kakrykul, Peter-Tau, Anachev, Tra-Tau, Trikol, Novobiktov, Birsk settlement, Tash-Elga burials). In the Volga-[[Kama River|Kama]] area and more northerly the culture extends to the [[Pechora River]] and [[Ural Mountains|Subarctic Ural]].

In the Volga and Lower Kama areas the traces of the Ananyino Culture fade in the 6th century BCE, in other areas in the 3rd to 2nd centuries BCE.

==Archeological monuments==
Unfortified settlements, fortresses and burials have been found. In the settlements and fortresses the remains of surface timber dwellings (10×5 m - 12×4 м) were found. In the Konetsgor settlement long houses divided into sections with hearths located on their longitudinal axis were found. The population was engaged in cattle breeding and agriculture, as well as hunting and fishing. Well developed were both iron and nonferrous metallurgy, bronze casting and forging, weaving, spinning, bone and leatherwork, and pottery. Typical ceramics are round-bottomed with indented and rope decorations. In the settlements are many bone utensils, mainly for hunting and fishing, like arrowheads of various forms, harpoons, mattock tips.

The burial sites are without mounds and sometimes very extensive. The older Akhmylov cemetery contained more than 1100 burials. The earliest of them had stone [[stela]]e with depictions of  weaponry beside the burial. In the 6th or 5th century BC they were replaced with stelae above the tombs, sometimes with male images with or without weapons. Inhumations in pit tombs, covered with timber chambers predominate. Single burials prevailed, but paired and collective, dismembered (reburials) and partial (skulls) burials are also known. Burials were in some cases accompanied by meat offerings (horsemeat for men and beef for women), and various objects, including clay vessels. In the male burials are usually found weapons and work tools including spears, kelts, swords, daggers, arrowheads, wedges, and ornaments. In the female tombs are ornaments including bracelets, neckrings, sets of pendants and tubules sown on a leather headband). In the early period bronze and iron tools and weapons co-existed with flint arrowheads and scrapers.

The Ananyino culture was greatly influenced by the [[Colchian culture|Colchian]]-[[Koban culture]]s of the [[Caucasus]] region, the [[Scythians]], and the eastern nomadic cultures of the Eurasian steppes. Especially significant were the links of the Ananyino people with the Caucasus cultures, represented by numerous imported products. It was determined that technological methods for iron processing ascend to the Caucasian traditions.

== Language==
The Ananyino people apparently belonged to the [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] group.&lt;ref&gt;http://old.kpfu.ru/amku/anan.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the north-eastern part of the basin formed the [[Permian languages|Proto-Permians]], in its western part tribes of [[Volga Finns]].

The history of '''ancient Iberian coinage''' begins as early as the fifth century BC, but widespread minting and circulation in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]] did not begin until late in the third century, during the [[Second Punic War]].{{sfn|Ripollès|2005b}} Civic coinages - emissions made by individual cities at their own volition - continued under the first two and a half centuries of Roman control until ending in the mid-first century AD.{{sfn|Ripollès|2005b|p=93}} Some non-civic coins were minted on behalf of Roman emperors during this period and continued to be minted after the cessation of the civic coinages.{{sfn|Burnett|Amandry|Ripollès|1992}} After the cessation of the civic coinages, these Imperial coins were the only coins minted in Iberia until the coins of the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi]] and [[Visigothic coinage|Visigoths]].

Ancient Iberia was connected to the eastern and central Mediterranean, and so there are links to the Greek, Roman and Punic (Carthaginian) civic coinages. Yet there are also many points of difference that reflect dynamics within Iberia itself.{{sfn|García-Bellido|Callegarin|Jiménez|2011}}{{sfn|Campo|2013}}{{sfn|Chaves|2008|page=108}}{{sfn|Ripollès|2005b|pages=84}}

Small numbers of coins minted in other parts of the Mediterranean had circulated along the eastern coast of Spain perhaps from the sixth century, with an uptick from the fourth century.{{sfn|Ripollès|2011}}
These coins were part of a colonial frontier economy in which indigenous towns traded wines, ceramics and finished goods primarily for raw materials: precious metals, wood, food products and perhaps slaves.{{sfn|Rouillard|2009}}{{sfn|Sanmartí|2009}}
Some coins may also have been earned by Iberian mercenaries fighting overseas.{{sfn|Ripollès|2011|pages=217}}

Throughout the western Mediterranean, new coinage traditions appear around the 4th century. Non-Greek cities in the Italian Peninsula (including Rome) begin minting in the 4th and early 3rd century.{{sfn|Crawford|1985|p=1-2}}
Carthage minted from the mid-4th century, as with the Greek tradition following earlier emissions from Phoenician colonies in Sicily.{{sfn|Campo|2013|p=11}}
In the north of the Iberian peninsula, the [[Massilia|Massiliote]] colonies of [[Empúries|Emporion]] and [[Roses (Catalan town)|Rhode]] minted mainly silver coins from the mid-fifth and late fourth centuries, respectively.{{sfn|Villaronga|1994|p=11}}{{sfn|Ripollès|2005a|p=187}}{{sfn|Campo|2005}}
Further to the south, the Phoenician colonies of [[Eivissa Town|Ebusus]] and [[Cádiz|Gadir]] minted bronze coins from the second half of the fourth and early third centuries, respectively.{{sfn|Ripollès|2005a|p=190-1}}{{sfn|Campo|2013|p=12-3}}
Additionally, the prominent Iberian town of [[Sagunto|Arse]] (Roman Saguntum) minted bronze and silver coins from the middle of the fourth century.{{sfn|Ripollès|2003|p=189}}{{sfn|Ripollès|2002}}

Within Iberian society, wealth could take a variety of forms, sometimes regionally specific.
The discovery of mixed hoards containing coins, jewellery and precious metal bullion suggests that coins were being used as part of a range of ways to store, display and exchange wealth.{{sfn|Ripollès|2011}}
For example, a late fifth century hoard found in a wall in the Iberian town of Puig de la Nau contained four gold earrings, a gold stud, a silver bracelet and a silver coin from Emporion.{{sfn|Oliver|Perea|1999}}
In many such hoards, some of the silver has been cut into small pieces, which can be related to finds of weights and scales and suggests that this metal circulated as a form of 'proto-money'.{{sfn|Ripollès|2011|p=219}}

==Second Punic War (218-205 BC in Iberia)==

Part of the [[Second Punic War]] was fought in the Iberian Peninsula and coins were used by combatants on all sides.
This led to a widespread and dramatic increase in the number of places where coins were minted and the amount of coin in circulation.

To fund their war effort, the Carthaginians minted gold, [[electrum]], silver and bronze coins.{{sfn|Villargona|1994|p=63-74}}
These coins may have been minted in the Barcid 'capital' of [[Carthago Nova]] or perhaps were minted simply in Carthaginian military camps.
In addition to these coins and those of [[Gadir]] and [[Ebusus]], Phoenician colonies along the south coast such as [[Malaga|Malaka]] and [[Sexi (Phoenician colony)|Sexi]] also minted bronze coins.{{sfn|Villargona|1994|p=81-107}}

Along the east coast and particularly in the northeast a great number of towns minted silver drachmas.
Some of these coins imitate the drachmas of Emporion or Massalia, while others have [[Iberian language|Iberian]] legends, a few of which can be related to towns or peoples but many of which are unknown or illegible.{{sfn|Villargona|1994|p=17-60}}
This silver coinage is generally seen as minted by the pro-Roman side, particularly as little Roman coin seems to have reached the Peninsula given the concurrent fighting in the Italian Peninsula.{{sfn|Chaves|2012a|p=154-7}}
But given the fluid situation of the war, particularly in the early years, some of these emissions may have been minted to aid the Carthaginian cause.{{sfn|López|2010}}

==Republican coinage (190s-72 BC) ==

}}

After this war, and the subsequent Roman annexation of much of the Peninsula, many indigenous towns and a few Roman colonial towns minted civic coins over the second and early first centuries.
The main catalogue for these coins is the ''Corpus nummum hispaniae ante Augusti aetatem'' (CNH) but see also the more recent ''Diccionario de cecas y pueblos hispánicos''.{{sfn|Villaronga|1994}}{{sfn|García-Bellido|Blázquez|2001}}
The indigenous towns in [[Hispania Citerior]] minted coins with Iberian scripts and either Iberian or Celtiberian legends.
These coins were often typologically similar, with a heroic male portrait on the obverse and a horseman on the reverse - the so-called "jinete" (horseman) coins.
The areas in which coins were minted and circulating expanded as Roman control was spread into the interior of the Peninsula.
The legends and iconography on coins from [[Hispania Ulterior]] were more diverse, with Latin legends common but also some Iberian scripts while Punic continued to be used in the old Phoenician colonies along the south coast.
Hence although coins from this era are often called [[Iberians|Iberian]] coins, this description does not cover all coins minted during the Republic.
Indeed, a smaller number of Roman colonial towns minted in Latin, following Italian and Roman examples more closely. These include [[Valencia|Valentia]] and [[Toledo, Spain|Toletum]]. 
The numbers of towns minting peaked in the last third of the second century and early first century, and then declined rapidly in the early first century, particularly in Hispania Citerior after the end of the [[Sertorius|Sertorian]] War.{{sfn|Ripollès|2005b}}

The purpose of these coins is unclear.
They may be related to ad hoc Roman tribute demands or rents on land confiscated by Rome.
But the amounts minted are insufficient to represent regular taxation or legionary pay.{{sfn|Aguilar|Ñaco del Hoyo|1995}}{{sfn|Ñaco del Hoyo|Prieto|1999}}
Widely varying levels of production suggest that the reasons each town minted were diverse.{{sfn|Gozalbes|2009}}
Some coins seem tightly related to particular extractive or productive actitivites, such as mining camps in the south or fish-salting industries along the south coast.{{sfn|García-Bellido|1986}}{{sfn|Mora|2003}}
As the decision to mint was taken by local communities, and many elements of the legends and iconography seem locally significant, there may have been a strong element of local pride and identity at stake.{{sfn|Chaves|2012b}}{{sfn|García-Bellido|2005}} 
Once in circulation, Iberian coins predominantly stayed within the region where they were minted although some did travel further afield.{{sfn|Ripollès|2007|p=94}}
The production of many bronze coins and even many fractions as well as high numbers of coins found throughout all different types of site, from large towns to small farms, suggest a wide range of everyday uses.{{sfn|Ripollès|2005a|p=195}}{{sfn|Sinner|2012}}

==Late Republican and Julio-Claudian coinage (72 BC-41 AD)==

{{Coin image box 1 double

}}

From around the mid-first century BC, the number of towns emitting coins decreased and Latin legends were standardised throughout the Peninsula.{{sfn|Ripollès|2005b|p=87-9}}
Coins were mainly now emitted by more important towns that had received privileged juridical status from victorious Roman generals in the Civil Wars and then from the new [[Julio-Claudian]] emperors [[Augustus]] and [[Tiberius]].
Many of the coins emitted proclaim the new status of emitting towns as Roman [[coloniae]] or [[municipia]], and individual civic iconography was used with strong similarities to that used in other Roman provinces and media.{{sfn|Ripollès|2005b|p=92}}
These emissions are conventionally called [[Roman provincial currency|(Roman) Provincial coins]].
The main catalogue for these coins is Volume I of the ''Roman Provincial Coinage'' (RPC).{{sfn|Burnett|Amandry|Ripollès|1992}}

A handful of mints in eastern Iberia did attempt to retain the jinete coins with bilingual Iberian and Latin legends, but this did not become popular.
The peak of these provincial emissions was under Augustus and Tiberius, and the last 'local' coins were emitted under the emperor [[Caligula]], in the mid-first century AD.{{sfn|Ripollès|2005b|p=93}}
This cessation of local coinage in the mid-first century AD was not unique to Hispania but occurred throughout the western Provinces.{{sfn|Burnett|Amandry|Ripollès|1992|p=18}}
From that point on the only emissions in Roman Hispania were emissions from a few Imperial mints controlled by the emperor and used for purposes such as legionary pay.{{sfn|Ripollès|2005b|p=93}}

Two main reasons are given for the provincial emissions.
Firstly, the new [[municipia]] and [[coloniae]] wanted to advertise their status and Imperial favour.{{sfn|Burnett|Amandry|Ripollès|1992|pages=16-7}}
Secondly, these new constitutional forms came with state expenses. 
These emissions may have been intended to partly meet such expenses.
Once these coins were in circulation, they were likely used in the broad range of roles coins played in Roman monetised economic life.{{sfn|Lledó|2004}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2649">{{for|the first-century bishop|Anianus of Alexandria}}
'''Annianus of Alexandria''' ({{lang-grc-gre|italic=yes|Annianos)}} was a monk who flourished in [[Alexandria]] during the [[bishop]]ric of [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus of Alexandria]] around the beginning of the fifth century. He criticized the world history of his contemporary monk [[Panodorus of Alexandria]] for relying too much on secular sources rather than biblical sources for his dates.

As a result, Annianus developed his own [[chronology]] which placed [[Dating Creation|Creation]] on 25 March 5492 BC. This created the Alexandrian Era whose first day was the first day of the [[proleptic calendar|proleptic]] Alexandrian civil year in progress, 29 August 5493 BC. This year was eleven Paschal cycles of 532 years each before the Alexandrian year beginning 29 August 360, which itself was four [[Metonic cycle|19-year cycles]] after the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of the Diocletian Era on 29 August 284. The former is known as the Era of Grace in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]], whereas the latter is known as the [[Era of Martyrs]]. He was the first [[computus|computist]] to recognize the 532-year cycle of [[Easter]]s in the [[Julian calendar]]. This cycle is often attributed to [[Victorius of Aquitaine|Victorius]] of [[Aquitaine]] in 457, the first to recognize such a cycle in the West.

None of Annianus's writings have survived. He is principally known from the discussion of his works by [[George Syncellus]] during the 9th century, though lesser fragments appear elsewhere. [[Elijah of Nisibis]] cites him in his 11th-century ''Chronography''.{{sfn|Mosshammer|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&amp;pg=PA359 359]}}

'''Anywhere on Earth''' (AoE) is a calendar designation which indicates that a period expires when the date passes everywhere on Earth. The last place on Earth where any date exists is on [[Howland and Baker islands]], in the [[UTC−12:00|IDLW]] time zone (the West side of the [[International Date Line]]), and so is the last spot on the globe for any day to exist. Therefore, the day ends AoE when it ends on Howland Island.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieee802.org/16/aoe.html|title=IEEE 802.16 AOE Deadline Documentation|website=www.ieee802.org|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention originated in [[IEEE 802.16]] balloting procedures. At this point, many IEEE 802 ballot deadlines are established as the end of day using "AoE", for "Anywhere on Earth" as a designation. This means that the deadline has not passed if, anywhere on Earth, the deadline date has not yet passed.

Note that the day's end AoE occurs at noon [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) of the following day,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Howland and Baker islands]] being halfway around the world from the [[prime meridian]] that is the base reference longitude for UTC.

Thus, in standard notation this is:
: [[UTC−12:00]] hour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe|title=AoE – Anywhere on Earth (Time Zone Abbreviation)|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2379">'''Babatunde Lawal''' is an art historian and scholar of the arts of [[Nigeria]]. His research is focused on the visual culture of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and its influences in the Americas.&lt;ref name=VCU /&gt; He is currently a professor of [[Art History]] at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].&lt;ref name=VCU&gt;{{cite web|title=Babatunde Lawal |url=http://arts.vcu.edu/arthistory/faculty-bio/babatunde-lawal/ |work=The Department of Art History, Factulty: Bio |publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University |accessdate=3 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523102325/http://arts.vcu.edu/arthistory/faculty-bio/babatunde-lawal/ |archivedate=23 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawal was born and raised in Isale-Eko (Oju Olokun Street), a district of [[Lagos]].&lt;ref name=Lawal&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawal|first=Babatunde|title=The Gèlèdé spectacle : art, gender, and social harmony in an African culture|year=1996|publisher=University of Washington press|location=Seattle|isbn=978-0-295-97599-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been raised in Nigeria himself, Lawal's scholarship demonstrates the use of a theoretical model that draws heavily from first-person accounts of various Nigeria customs and art making practices. This sets him apart from the majority of European and American scholars of African art.

In his book on [[Gelede]], Lawal writes: "A number of scholars [...] have called for a new critical approach that will allow African traditions to be studied on their own terms, instead of being viewed through Eurocentric lenses... What is urgently needed, as Henry Gates has pointed out, is a method that enables a given culture 'to speak for itself about its nature and various functions, rather than to read it, or analyse it, in terms of... theories borrowed whole from other traditions, appropriated from without.'"&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

[[Abbé]] '''Charles-Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg''' (8 September 1814 &amp;ndash; 8 January 1874) was a noted French writer, [[ethnographer]], historian and  [[archaeology|archaeologist]]. He became a specialist in [[Mesoamerica]]n studies, travelling extensively in the region. 
His writings, publications, and recovery of historical documents contributed much to knowledge of the region's languages, writing, history and culture, particularly those of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Aztec]] civilizations. However, his speculations concerning relationships between the ancient Maya and the lost continent of [[Atlantis]] inspired [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] and encouraged the pseudo-science of [[Mayanism]].

== Early life and writings ==
He was born in [[Bourbourg]], a small town with many [[Flemings|Flemish]] influences near [[Dunkirk, France]], as the [[First French Empire]] was ending.

As a youth he went to [[Ghent]] in newly independent Belgium to study theology and philosophy. 
He became interested in writing during his studies there, and in 1837 aged 23 he began contributing essays to a Parisian journal. He wrote several historical accounts (using a pseudonym), including one concerning [[Jerusalem]]. He published several novels of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style which was then very much in vogue. One of these, ''Le Sérapéon'', received reviews which implied it had a very close resemblance to [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]'s 1809 novel ''[[Les Martyrs]]''. Such near-allegations of plagiarism and inaccuracies in his works were to be made several times during his career.

Despite such criticisms, his reputation as a notable young writer and intellectual continued to develop. He transferred his studies and residence to Rome, where in 1845 he was ordained into the [[Roman Catholic]] priesthood, at the age of 30.

== Dispatched to Quebec ==
A year previously he had come to the attention of the Canadian Abbé, Léon Gingras, whom he had met (and apparently impressed) in Rome. Abbé Gingras entreated his friend and colleague the vicar-general of [[Quebec]], Abbé Charles-Félix Cazeau, to have Brasseur de Bourbourg assigned to a job in the [[seminary]] there. Correspondence began in late 1844, with Abbé Gingras claiming that the seminary should ''"...move heaven and earth to ensure that such a splendid bird does not escape us and fly to Montreal, where it would be so highly thought of"''.

A year later after having obtained his ordination, Brasseur de Bourbourg's job in Quebec was approved by the [[Archbishop]], [[Joseph Signay]], and in the autumn of 1845 he left Europe for the [[British Empire|British]] colony of the [[Province of Canada]], stopping briefly in [[Boston]] along the way.

Upon his arrival in [[Quebec City]] he began work as a professor of ecclesiastical history at the seminary (the Séminaire de Québec, founded in 1663). After only a brief time however, his series of lectures was discontinued, for some unspecified reason.

Perhaps having extra time, Brasseur de Bourbourg began a programme of research of the history of the [[archdiocese]] of Quebec, and in particular of its 17th-century founder, [[François de Laval]], the first [[Roman Catholic Bishop of Quebec]] (after whom the seminary's later incarnation as a University, the [[Université Laval]], is named). The results of his archival investigations were published in early 1846 as a biography of Laval. The contents of this pamphlet seemed to displease his Canadian colleagues somewhat, for a dispute began which made his position there uncertain, or at least uncomfortable. Also, he apparently disliked the harsh winter climate (to judge by some comments he made in the dedication of his later ''History of Canada''), and may also have been a factor in his departure which was soon to ensue.

He left the seminary later in that year, returning to Boston where he found a job with the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|diocese of Boston]]. The then current Bishop, [[John Bernard Fitzpatrick]], with whom he was evidently on better terms than with his previous superiors, made him vicar-general of the diocese.

Towards the end of the year Brasseur de Bourbourg returned to Europe, to spend some time conducting research in the archives of Rome and Madrid, in preparation for a new project—travel to Central America.

== Travels and expeditions to Central America ==
[[Image:Histoire du Mexique (Brasseur de Bourbourg) cover.jpeg|180px|thumb|left|Coverpage of [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg|Brasseur de Bourbourg's]] original 1857 work, ''"Histoire du Mexique"''.]]
From 1848 to 1863 he travelled extensively as a [[missionary]] in many parts of [[Mexico]] and Central America.

During these journeys he gave great attention to [[Mesoamerica]]n antiquities and became well-versed in the then-current theories and knowledge about the history of the region and the [[Pre-Columbian]] civilisations whose sites and monuments remained, yet were little understood.

Using information he had collected during his time spent travelling there, as well as that compiled by other scholars of his time, he published during 1857–1859 a history of the [[Aztec]] civilization, containing what was then known or speculated about the former kingdom, which had been conquered some three hundred years previously by the Spanish [[conquistador]]es in alliance with local enemies of the Aztecs.

He also conducted research into the local languages and their transliteration into the [[Latin alphabet]]. Between 1861 and 1864 he edited and published a collection of documents in the indigenous languages.

In 1864 he was [[archaeologist]] of the French military expedition in Mexico, and his resulting work ''Monuments anciens du Mexique'' was published by the French Government in 1866.

[[Image:De Landa alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Page from Brasseur de Bourbourg's edition of [[Diego de Landa|de Landa]]'s ''Relación de las Cosas de Yucatán'', with the famous [[de Landa alphabet]].]]

== Discovery of de Landa's work ==
In 1862 while searching through archives at the Royal Academy of History in [[Madrid]] for [[New World]] materials, he came across an abridged copy of a manuscript which had originally been written by the Spanish cleric [[Diego de Landa]] sometime around 1566. De Landa had been one of those charged with disseminating the [[Roman Catholic]] faith amongst the [[Maya peoples]] in Spain's new Central American possessions during the period after the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]], and had lived there for several years. His manuscript (''Relación de las Cosas de Yucatán'') had been written upon his enforced return to Spain, where he was charged with illegally or improperly conducting an [[Inquisition]] (he was later absolved, returning to the New World as the appointed Bishop of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]). In the manuscript de Landa had recorded much information about the Maya peoples and customs, based on his own observations and discussions with Mayan informants. Brasseur de Bourbourg's main interest in the document, however, was a section in which de Landa reproduced what he termed "an alphabet" of the as-yet undeciphered [[Maya hieroglyphics]], the [[writing system]] of the ancient [[Maya civilization]]. In this passage de Landa had annotated the Mayan symbols (or [[glyph]]s) which supposedly corresponded to the letters of the [[Spanish alphabet]], as given to him by a Maya informant who he had quizzed. Brasseur de Bourbourg realised that this could prove to be basis of deciphering the Maya script, and he announced this discovery when republishing the manuscript (in a bilingual Spanish-French edition) in late 1863 with the title, ''Relation des choses de Yucatán de Diego de Landa''.

However, upon initial analysis by Brasseur de Bourbourg and others, the so-called "[[de Landa alphabet]]" proved to be problematic and inconsistent, and these immediate attempts to use this alphabet as a kind of "[[Rosetta Stone]]" to read the glyphs failed. Nevertheless, Brasseur de Bourbourg's uncovering of this document and de Landa's alphabet would much later prove to be vital in the eventual decipherment of the Maya glyphs. Brasseur de Bourbourg's attempts, and those of others which followed, were misled insofar as they interpreted the signs [[alphabet]]ically. When the signs were recognised to be mainly [[syllabary|syllabic]], significant progress was made.

== Publication of the Popol Vuh ==
In 1861 he published another significant work: a French translation of the [[Popol Vuh]], a sacred book of the [[K'iche' people|Quiché (K'iche') Maya people]]. He included a [[grammar]] of the [[K'iche' language]] and an essay on Central American [[Maya mythology|mythology]].

== Speculations concerning Atlantis ==
Brasseur began to write about [[Atlantis]] in his publication ''Grammaire de la langue quichée'' (1862), in which he expressed his belief that the lost land described by Plato had existed with an advanced degree of civilization before the beginning of civilizations in Europe and Asia. He suggested that the origins of European and Persian words could be traced to indigenous languages of the Americas and that the ancient cultures of the New and Old Worlds had been in constant communication with one another.

In 1866, ''Monuments anciens du Mexique (Palenque, et autres ruines de l'ancienne civilisation du Mexique)'' was published with a text by Brasseur de Bourbourg accompanied by lavish illustrations by [[Jean-Frédéric Waldeck]]. Although Waldeck's depictions of the ruins at Palenque were based on first-hand knowledge, his artistic reconstructions and embellishments implied a close relationship between Maya art and architecture and that of [[Classical antiquity]] Greece and Rome. This was subsequently demonstrated to be spurious, but not before Waldeck's artwork had inspired speculations about contact between New and Old World civilizations, specifically via the lost continent of [[Atlantis]].

These speculations were reinforced by Brasseur de Bourboug's own references to Plato's descriptions of the culture and society of Atlantis, which Brasseur believed was continued by ancient Maya civilization, in his book ''Quatre Lettres sur le Méxique'' (1868). In this publication, Brasseur de Bourbourg made extensive parallels between Maya and Egyptian pantheons and cosmologies, implying that they all had a common source on the lost continent of Atlantis. He developed these ideas further in his publication ''Quatre lettres sur le Mexique'' (1868), which presents a history of Atlantis based on his interpretation of Maya myths. His writings inspired [[Augustus Le Plongeon]] and also [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]], whose book ''[[Atlantis: The Antediluvian World]]'' contains numerous references to Brasseur de Bourbourg's scholarship. However, an academic wrote in 1875 that not a single contemporary scholar accepted Brasseur de Bourbourg's theories about Atlantis.

The combination of Brasseur de Bourbourg's interests in [[spiritualism]] and these speculations about relations between the ancient Maya and Atlantis provided the basis for [[Mayanism]].

== Identification of a Maya codex ==
In 1866, Brasseur de Bourbourg had an opportunity to examine an artefact in Madrid which was in the possession of a Spanish [[paleography]] professor named Juan de Tro y Ortolano, who had purchased it some six years earlier. This artefact was an old [[codex]], a book made from paper-bark in the form of a folded screen of continuous pages, several metres in length when extended. The codex contained numerous signs and drawings, which Brasseur de Bourbourg was readily able to identify as being Mayan in origin, having seen and studied many similar markings and glyphs while in Central America.

Tro y Ortolano gave him permission to publish the codex in a reproduction, and Brasseur de Bourbourg gave it the name ''Troano Codex'' in his honour. His identification of the codex was significant, as it was the only third such [[Maya codices|Maya codex]] to have been uncovered (the second, the [[Paris Codex|Codex Paris]], had been discovered by the French scholar [[Léon de Rosny]] only a few years before). In particular, Brasseur de Bourbourg recognised its exceeding rarity, since de Landa's ''Relación'', which he had earlier rediscovered, gave an account of how he had ordered the destruction of all such Maya codices he could find, and many volumes had been burned.

During 1869–1870 Brasseur de Bourbourg published his analyses and interpretations of the content of the Troano codex in his work ''Manuscrit Troano, études sur le système graphique et la langue des Mayas''. He proposed some translations for the glyphs recorded in the codex, in part based on the associated pictures and in part on de Landa's alphabet, but his efforts were tentative and largely unsuccessful.

However, his translation would later inspire [[Augustus Le Plongeon]]'s pseudo-science and speculation about the [[Mu (lost continent)|lost continent of Mu]]. The name ''Mu'' was actually used first by Brasseur de Bourbourg.

A few years later, another Maya codex was found possessed by another collector, which became known as the ''Codex Cortesianus'' (in the belief that it had been in the possession of [[Hernán Cortés]]). When Léon de Rosny examined it later, he determined that it was actually a part of the Troano codex, the two parts having been separated at some indeterminate time in the past. The two parts were later rejoined and are known collectively as the [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Codex ''Madrid'' or ''Tro-Cortesianus'']]; they remain displayed in Madrid.
  
In 1871 Brasseur de Bourbourg published his ''Bibliothèque Mexico-Guatémalienne'', a compendium of literature and sources associated with Mesoamerican studies.

His last article, "Chronologie historique des Mexicains" (1872) refers to the [[Codex Chimalpopoca]] and identifies four periods of world cataclysms that began about 10,500 BC and were the result of shifts of the Earth's axis (a concept related to [[pole shift theory]]).

== Death and legacy ==
He died at [[Nice]] at the beginning of 1874, at the age of 59.

His archaeological fieldwork, as well as his diligent collection, discovery and republication of source materials, proved to be very useful for subsequent Mesoamerican researchers and scholars. The interpretations and theories he advanced proved to be mostly inaccurate.

{{History of Colombia}}

The '''Colombian conflict''' began in the mid-1960s and is a [[low intensity conflict|low-intensity]] [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric war]] between [[Government of Colombia|Colombian governments]], [[Paramilitarism in Colombia|paramilitary groups]], [[Illegal drug trade in Colombia|crime syndicates]], and far-left guerrillas such as the [[FARC|Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC), and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army]] (ELN), fighting each other to increase their influence in Colombian territory.&lt;ref&gt;

The reasons for fighting vary from group to group.

According to a study by [[National Center for Historical Memory|Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory]], 220,000 people have died in the conflict between 1958 and 2013, most of them civilians (177,307 civilians and 40,787 fighters) and more than five million civilians were forced from their homes between 1985 – 2012, generating the world's second largest population of [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs).&lt;ref name="estadisticas"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/micrositios/informeGeneral/estadisticas.html | title = Informe ¡Basta Ya!

==Armed conflict==
The '''armed conflict''' in Colombia emerged due to a combination of economic, political and social factors in the country {{round|{{age|format=raw|1961|5|16}}|-1}} years ago.&lt;ref name="Colombian armed conflict"&gt;{{cite web|author= Lilian Yaffe|url= http://www.icesi.edu.co/revistas/index.php/revista_cs/article/view/1133/1509|title= Armed conflict in Colombia: analysis of the economic, social and institutional causes of violent opposition|publisher= icesi.edu.co|date= 3 October 2011|language= Spanish|accessdate= April 24, 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131016063214/http://www.icesi.edu.co/revistas/index.php/revista_cs/article/view/1133/1509|archive-date= 16 October 2013|dead-url= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early period (1974–1982), guerrilla groups like the [[FARC]], the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] and others focused on slogan of greater equality through communism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ángel|first=Gabriel|title=A PROPÓSITO DE LOS 22 AÑOS DE SU MUERTE Memoria de una entrevista con Jacobo Arenas|url=http://farc-ep.co/?p=1635|publisher=FARC-EP|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they came to have support from some local people. However, the balance of power and influence shifted in the mid-1980s when Colombia granted greater political and fiscal autonomy to local governments, strengthening the position of the [[Government of Colombia|Colombian Government]] in more remote regions of the country.&lt;ref name="Colombian armed conflict"/&gt; In 1985, the FARC co-created the left-wing [[Patriotic Union (Colombia)|Patriotic Union]] (UP) political party. Eventually, the UP distanced itself from insurgent groups. However, right-wing paramilitaries apparently linked to the armed forces murdered a large number of party members during the 1980s and 90s, decimating the organization and aggravating the broader conflict.&lt;ref name="U.P."&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21582305-these-are-what-left-most-needs-peace-and-brotherly-love|title= Peace and brotherly love|publisher= economist.com |date= 27 July 2013|accessdate= 22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the Historical Commission on the Conflict and its Victims (Comisión Histórica del Conflicto Armado y sus Víctimas – CHCV) published its report entitled "Contribution to an Understanding of the Armed Conflict in Colombia". The document, that deals with the "multiple reasons for the conflict, the principle factors and circumstances that made it possible and the most notable impacts on the population", help to understand Colombia's armed conflict in terms of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/commission-seeks-explain-causes-conflict-colombia |title= Understanding Colombia's war |author= Kai Ambos and John Zuluaga |publisher= D+C, development and cooperation|accessdate= 21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The origin of the armed conflict in Colombia goes back to 1920 with agrarian disputes over the Sumapaz and Tequendama regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecsbdefesa.com.br/defesa/fts/HGC.pdf|title=History of the Guerillas in Colombia|format=PDF|publisher=Ecsbdefesa.com.br|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peasants at the time fought over ownership of coffee lands which caused the liberals and conservative parties to take sides in the conflict, worsening it.

In 1948 the assassination of [[populism|populist]] [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]] radically stirred up the armed conflict.  It led to the ''[[Bogotazo]]'', an urban riot killing more than 4,000 people, and subsequently to ten years of sustained rural warfare between members of [[Colombian Liberal Party]] and the [[Colombian Conservative Party]], a period known as ''[[La Violencia]]'' ("The Violence"), which took the lives of more than 200,000 people throughout the countryside.&lt;ref name="beyond-bogota-timeline" /&gt;

As ''La Violencia'' wound down, most self-defense and guerrilla units made up of Liberal Party supporters demobilized, but at the same time some former Liberals and active [[Colombian Communist Party|Communist]] groups continued operating in several rural enclaves. One of the Liberal bands was a group known as the "Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia" (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), or FARC, formed by [[Pedro Antonio Marin]] in 1964.  The goal of the FARC, among other things, was redistribution of land that would benefit poor peasant farmers like Marin, along with the desire to establish a communist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kraul|first1=Chris|title=The battles began in 1964: Here's a look at Colombia's war with the FARC rebels|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-colombia-farc-explainer-snap-story.html|website=latimes.com|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1958, an exclusively bipartisan political alternation system, known as the National Front, resulted from an agreement between the Liberal and Conservative parties. The agreement had come as a result of the two parties attempting to find a final political solution to the decade of mutual violence and unrest, remaining in effect until 1974.&lt;ref name="beyond-bogota-timeline" /&gt;

==Timeline==

===1960s===
In the early 1960s Colombian Army units loyal to the [[History of Colombia#The National Front regime (1958–1974)|National Front]] began to attack peasant communities.  This happened throughout Colombia with the Colombian army considering that these peasant communities were enclaves for bandits and Communists. It was the 1964 attack on the community of [[Marquetalia, Caldas|Marquetalia]] that motivated the later creation of FARC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/planlazomarquetalia.htm |title=Marquetalia and the FARC |accessdate=2010-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028135631/http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/planlazomarquetalia.htm |archivedate=October 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the infantry and police encirclement of the villages inside Marquetalia (3500 men swept through the area), Manuel Marulanda managed to escape the army cordon.

Unlike the rural FARC, which had roots in the previous Liberal peasant struggles, the ELN was mostly an outgrowth of university unrest and would subsequently tend to follow a small group of charismatic leaders, including [[Camilo Torres Restrepo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/universityviolence.htm#eln |title=Camilo Torres and the ELN |accessdate=2010-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007003946/http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/universityviolence.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both guerrilla groups remained mostly operational in remote areas of the country during the rest of the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The Colombian government organized several short-lived counter-guerrilla campaigns in the late 1950s and early 1960s. These efforts were aided by the U.S. government and the [[CIA]], which employed hunter-killer teams and involved U.S. personnel from the previous [[Philippines|Philippine]] campaign against the [[Huks]], and which would later participate in the subsequent [[Phoenix Program]] in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="icdc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/planlazomtt.htm |title=Hunter Killer Teams |accessdate=2010-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606144047/http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/planlazomtt.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
By 1974, another challenge to the state's authority and legitimacy had come from the [[19th of April Movement]] (M-19), leading to a new phase in the conflict. The M-19 was a mostly urban guerrilla group, founded in response to an electoral fraud during the final National Front election of [[Misael Pastrana Borrero]] (1970–1974) and the forced removal of former president [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/r/rojas_gustavo.htm |title=biografia Gustavo Rojas Pinilla |accessdate=2016-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408104500/http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/r/rojas_gustavo.htm |archivedate=April 8, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
By 1982, the perceived passivity of the FARC, together with the relative success of the government's efforts against the M-19 and ELN, enabled the administration of the Liberal Party's [[Julio César Turbay Ayala]] (1978–82) to lift a state-of-siege decree that had been in effect, on and off, for most of the previous 30 years. Under the latest such decree, president Turbay had implemented security policies that, though of some military value against the M-19 in particular, were considered highly questionable both inside and outside Colombian circles due to numerous accusations of military [[human rights abuse]]s against suspects and captured guerrillas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Citizen exhaustion due to the conflict's newfound intensity led to the election of president [[Belisario Betancur]] (1982–1986), a Conservative who won 47% of the popular vote, directed peace feelers at all the insurgents, and negotiated a 1984 cease-fire with the FARC at [[La Uribe]], [[Meta Department|Meta]], after a 1982 release of many guerrillas imprisoned during the previous effort to overpower them. A truce was also arranged with the M-19. The [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] rejected entering any negotiation and continued to recover itself through the use of extortions and threats, in particular against foreign oil companies of European and U.S. origin.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

As these events were developing, the growing [[illegal drug trade]] and its consequences were also increasingly becoming a matter of widespread importance to all participants in the Colombian conflict. Guerrillas and newly wealthy drug lords had mutually uneven relations and thus numerous incidents occurred between them. Eventually the kidnapping of drug cartel family members by guerrillas led to the creation of the 1981 ''Muerte a Secuestradores'' (MAS) death squad ("Death to Kidnappers"). Pressure from the U.S. government and critical sectors of Colombian society was met with further violence, as the [[Medellín Cartel]] and its hitmen, bribed or murdered numerous public officials, politicians and others who stood in its way by supporting the implementation of [[extradition]] of Colombian nationals to the U.S. Victims of cartel violence included Justice Minister [[Rodrigo Lara Bonilla]], assassinated in 1984, an event which made the Betancur administration begin to directly oppose the drug lords.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The first negotiated cease-fire with the [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] ended when the guerrillas resumed fighting in 1985, claiming that the cease-fire had not been fully respected by official security forces, saying that several of its members had suffered threats and assaults, and also questioning the government's real willingness to implement any accords. The Betancur administration in turn questioned the M-19's actions and its commitment to the peace process, as it continued to advance high-profile negotiations against with the FARC, which led to the creation of the [[Patriotic Union (Colombia)|Patriotic Union]] (''Unión Patriótica'') -UP-, a legal and non-clandestine political organization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

On November 6, 1985, the M-19 [[Palace of Justice siege|stormed the Colombian Palace of Justice]] and held the Supreme Court magistrates hostage, intending to put president Betancur on trial. In the ensuing crossfire that followed the military's reaction, some 120 people lost their lives, as did most of the guerrillas, including several high-ranking operatives and 12 Supreme Court Judges.{{Ref|InsideColombia}} Both sides blamed each other for the outcome. This marked the end of Betancur's peace process.{{Ref|InsideColombia}}

Meanwhile, individual FARC members initially joined the UP leadership in representation of the guerrilla command, though most of the guerrilla's chiefs and militiamen did not demobilize nor disarm, as that was not a requirement of the process at that point in time. Tension soon significantly increased, as both sides began to accuse each other of not respecting the cease-fire.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

According to historian Daniel Pecáut, the creation of the Patriotic Union took the guerrillas' political message to a wider public outside of the traditional communist spheres of influence and led to local electoral victories in regions such as Urabá and Antioquia, with their mayoral candidates winning twenty-three municipalities and their congressional ones gaining fourteen seats (five in the Senate, nine in the lower Chamber) in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pecáut | first1 = Daniel | title = Las FARC: ¿Una guerrilla sin fin o sin fines? | publisher=Grupo Editorial Norma | year = 2008 | pages = 50–51 | isbn = 978-958-45-1322-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist Steven Dudley, who interviewed ex-FARC as well as former members of the UP and the Communist Party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dudley | first1 = Steven | title = Walking Ghosts: Murder and Guerrilla Politics in Colombia | publisher=Routledge | year = 2004 | pages = 58–61, 94–95, 233–237 | isbn = 0-415-93303-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; FARC leader [[Jacobo Arenas]] insisted to his subordinates that the UP's creation did not mean that the group would lay down its arms nor a rejection of the Seventh Conference's military strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Pecáut states that new recruits entered the guerrilla army and its urban militia units during the period, also claiming that FARC did not stop kidnapping and continued to target regional politicians for assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Pecáut, p. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1987, the UP's 1986 presidential candidate [[Jaime Pardo Leal]] was assassinated amid a wave of violence that would lead to the deaths of thousands of its party members at the hands of death squads.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, pp. 91–104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="still-being-160-163"&gt;{{Cite book|title=You are still being lied to: the remixed disinformation guide to media distortion, historical whitewashes and cultural myths |publisher=Constellation |year=2009| isbn=978-1-934708-07-1 |editor=Russ Kick |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pkUl8QASqHMC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=farc+paramilitaries&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=farc%20paramilitaries|pages=160–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pecáut, the killers included members of the military and the political class who had opposed Belisario Betancur's peace process and considered the UP to be little more than a "facade" for FARC, as well as drug traffickers and landowners who were also involved in the establishment of paramilitary groups.&lt;ref&gt;Pécaut, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===

====Early 1990s====
The [[Virgilio Barco Vargas]] (1986–1990) administration, in addition to continuing to handle the difficulties of the complex negotiations with the guerrillas, also inherited a particularly chaotic confrontation against the drug lords, who were engaged in a campaign of terrorism and murder in response to government moves in favor of their extradition overseas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In June 1987, the ceasefire between FARC and the Colombian government formally collapsed after the guerrillas attacked a military unit in the jungles of Caquetá.&lt;ref name="Pecáut, p. 52"&gt;Pecáut, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dudley, p. 102"&gt;Dudley, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist Steven Dudley, FARC founder [[Jacobo Arenas]] considered the incident to be a "natural" part of the truce and reiterated the group's intention to continue the dialogue, but President Barco sent an ultimatum to the guerrillas and demanded that they immediately disarm or face military retaliation.&lt;ref name="Dudley, p. 102"/&gt; Regional guerrilla and Army skirmishes created a situation where each violation of the ceasefire rendered it null in each location, until it was rendered practically nonexistent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

By 1990, at least 2,500 members of the FARC-founded Patriotic Union had been murdered, according to historian Daniel Pecáut, leading up to that year's assassination of presidential candidate [[Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa]]. The Colombian government initially blamed drug lord [[Pablo Escobar]] for the murder but journalist Steven Dudley argues that many in the UP pointed at then-Interior Minister [[Carlos Lemos Simmonds]] for publicly calling out the UP as the "political wing of FARC" shortly before the murder, while others claimed it was the result of an alliance between [[Fidel Castaño]], members of the Colombian military and the [[Administrative Department of Security|DAS]].&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, pp. 162–165&lt;/ref&gt; Pecáut and Dudley argue that significant tensions had emerged between Jaramillo, FARC and the Communist Party due to the candidate's recent criticism of the armed struggle and their debates over the rebels' use of kidnapping, almost leading to a formal break.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, pp. 127–139, 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pecáut, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; Jaramillo's death led to a large exodus of UP militants; in addition, by then many FARC cadres who joined the party had already returned to clandestinity, using the UP experience as an argument in favor of revolutionary war.&lt;ref name="still-being-160-163" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pecáut, p. 52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;

The M-19 and several smaller guerrilla groups were successfully incorporated into a peace process as the 1980s ended and the '90s began, which culminated in the elections for a [[Constituent Assembly of Colombia]] that would write a new constitution, which took effect in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Contacts with the FARC, which had irregularly continued despite the end of the ceasefire and the official 1987 break from negotiations, were temporarily cut off in 1990 under the presidency of [[César Gaviria Trujillo]] (1990–1994). The Colombian Army's assault on the FARC's ''Casa Verde'' sanctuary at [[La Uribe]], [[Meta Department|Meta]], followed by a FARC offensive that sought to undermine the deliberations of the Constitutional Assembly, began to highlight a significant break in the uneven negotiations carried over from the previous decade.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Both parties nevertheless never completely broke off some amount of political contacts for long, as some peace feelers continued to exist, leading to short rounds of conversations in both [[Caracas]], Venezuela (1991) and [[Tlaxcala]], Mexico (1992). Despite the signing of several documents, no concrete results were achieved when the talks ended.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====Mid-1990s====
FARC military activity increased throughout the bulk of the 1990s as the group continued to grow in wealth from both kidnapping and drug-related activities, while drug crops rapidly spread throughout the countryside. The guerrillas protected many of the coca growers from eradication campaigns and allowed them to grow and commercialize coca in exchange for a "tax" either in money or in crops.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In this context, FARC had managed to recruit and train more fighters, beginning to use them in concentrated attacks in a novel and mostly unexpected way. This led to a series of high-profile raids and attacks against Colombian state bases and patrols, mostly in the southeast of Colombia but also affecting other areas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In mid-1996, a civic protest movement made up of an estimated 200,000 coca growers from [[Putumayo Department|Putumayo]] and part of [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] began marching against the Colombian government to reject its drug war policies, including fumigations and the declaration of special security zones in some departments. Different analysts have stressed that the movement itself fundamentally originated on its own, but at the same time, FARC heavily encouraged the marchers and actively promoted their demands both peacefully and through the threat of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ces.fe.uc.pt/emancipa/research/en/ft/marchas.html |title=Research|publisher=Ces.fe.uc.pt |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uasb.edu.ec/padh/revista11/actualidad/milson%20betancourt.htm |title=Milson Betancourt |publisher=Uasb.edu.ec |accessdate=October 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311043855/http://www.uasb.edu.ec/padh/revista11/actualidad/milson%20betancourt.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in 1997 and 1998, town councilmen in dozens of municipalities of the south of the country were threatened, killed, kidnapped, forced to resign or to exile themselves to department capitals by the FARC and the ELN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/Colom99sp/capitulo-1.htm|title=CONTEXT ANALYSIS OF RIGHTS SITUATION IN COLOMBIA HUMAN|publisher=Cidh.oas.org|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bogota.usembassy.gov/wwwsdh97.shtml|title=Informe sobre prácticas de derechos humanos|date=January 30, 1998|language=Spanish|accessdate=August 31, 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050902193416/http://bogota.usembassy.gov/wwwsdh97.shtml|archivedate=September 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports98/colombia/Colom989-05.htm |title=Colombia and International Humanitarian Law |accessdate=February 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213145647/http://www.hrw.org/reports98/colombia/Colom989-05.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Las Delicias, [[Caquetá Department|Caquetá]], five FARC fronts (about 400 guerrillas) recognized intelligence pitfalls in a Colombian Army base and exploited them to overrun it on August 30, 1996, killing 34 soldiers, wounding 17 and taking some 60 as prisoners. Another significant attack took place in El Billar, Caquetá on March 2, 1998, where a Colombian Army counterinsurgency battalion was patrolling, resulting in the death of 62 soldiers and the capture of some 43. Other FARC attacks against Police bases in [[Miraflores, Guaviare|Miraflores]], [[Guaviare Department|Guaviare]] and [[La Uribe]], [[Meta Department|Meta]] in August 1998 killed more than a hundred soldiers, policemen and civilians, and resulted in the capture or kidnapping of a hundred more.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

These attacks, and the dozens of members of the Colombian security forces taken prisoner by the FARC, contributed to increasingly shaming the government of president [[Ernesto Samper Pizano]] (1994–1998) in the eyes of sectors of public and political opinion. He was already the target of numerous critics due to revelations of a drug-money scandal surrounding his presidential campaign. Perceptions of corruption due to similar scandals led to Colombia's decertification as a country cooperating with the United States in the [[war on drugs]] in 1995 (when the effects of the measure were temporarily waived), 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/latin_america/colombia_3-20.html|title=Online NewsHour: President Samper of Colombia|date=March 20, 1996|work=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=October 14, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026124344/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/latin_america/colombia_3-20.html|archivedate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public-i.org/report.aspx?aid=254&amp;sid=100|title=Narcotics and Economics Drive U.S. Policy in Latin America|accessdate=August 31, 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027170037/http://www.public-i.org/report.aspx?aid=254&amp;sid=100|archivedate=October 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samper administration reacted against FARC's attacks by gradually abandoning numerous vulnerable and isolated outposts in more than 100,000&amp;nbsp;km² of the rural countryside, instead concentrating Army and Police forces in the more heavily defended strongholds available, which allowed the guerrillas to more directly mobilize through and influence events in large areas of rural territory which were left with little or no remaining local garrisons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Samper also contacted the guerrillas in order to negotiate the release of some or all of the hostages in FARC hands, which led to the temporary demilitarization of the municipality of [[Cartagena del Chairá]], [[Caquetá Department|Caquetá]] in July 1997 and the unilateral liberation of 70 soldiers, a move which was opposed by the command of the Colombian military. Other contacts between the guerrillas and government, as well as with representatives of religious and economic sectors, continued throughout 1997 and 1998.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Altogether, these events were interpreted by some Colombian and foreign analysts as a turning point in the armed confrontation, giving the FARC the upper hand in the military and political balance, making the Colombian government a target of critics from some observers who concluded that its weakness was being evidenced, perhaps even overshadowing a future guerrilla victory in the middle term. A leaked 1998 U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) report went so far as to speculate that this could be possible within 5 years if the guerrilla's rate of operations was kept up without effective opposition. Some viewed this report as inaccurate and alarmist, claiming that it did not properly take into account many factors, such as possible actions that the Colombian state and the U.S. might take in response to the situation, nor the effects of the existence of paramilitary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/drugscolombia-docs/lasa.htm|title=Waging War US Policy Toward Colombia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050222194241/http://www.tni.org/drugscolombia-docs/lasa.htm|archive-date=February 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during this period, paramilitary activities increased, both legally and illegally. The creation of legal CONVIVIR self-defense and intelligence gathering groups was authorized by Congress and the Samper administration in 1994. Members of CONVIVIR groups were accused of committing numerous abuses against the civilian population by several human rights organizations. The groups were left without legal support after a 1997 decision by the Colombian Constitutional Court which restricted many of their prerrogatives and demanded stricter oversight. However, in April 1997, preexisting paramilitary forces and several former CONVIVIR members were joined to create the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]], a large paramilitary militia closely tied to drug trafficking which carried out attacks on the [[FARC]] and [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] rebel groups as well as civilians starting with the 1997 [[Mapiripán Massacre]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=35&amp;regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas|title=Database – Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)|publisher=Ucdp.uu.se|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AUC, originally present around the central/northwest part of the country, executed a series of raids into areas of guerrilla influence, targeting those that they considered as either guerrillas or their supporters.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=126|title=Terrorist Organization Profiles – START –  National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism|publisher=Start.umd.edu|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a continuing series of massacres. After some of these operations, government prosecutors and/or human rights organizations blamed officers and members of Colombian Army and police units for either passively permitting these acts, or directly collaborating in their execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revistacambio.com/html/portada/articulos/2142/|title=Uscátegui acusa|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201073959/http://www.revistacambio.com/html/portada/articulos/2142/|archive-date=December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR230302002?open&amp;of=ENG-2M4|title=Human Rights and USA Military Aid to Colombia III|accessdate=August 31, 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202152434/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR230302002?open&amp;of=ENG-2M4|archivedate=February 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/spanish/informes/1998/guerra3C.html|title=Guerra sin cuartel Colombia y el derecho internacional humanitario|language=Spanish|accessdate=August 31, 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830073333/https://www.hrw.org/spanish/informes/1998/guerra3C.html|archivedate=August 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998–1999===
On August 7, 1998, [[Andrés Pastrana Arango]] was sworn in as the President of Colombia. A member of the Conservative Party, Pastrana defeated Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa in a run-off election marked by high voter turn-out and little political unrest. The new president's program was based on a commitment to bring about a peaceful resolution of Colombia's longstanding civil conflict and to cooperate fully with the United States to combat the trafficking of illegal drugs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In July 1999, Colombian military forces attacked the town of Puerto Lleras, Colombia where FARC rebels were stationed. Using U.S. supplied aircraft and equipment, and backed with U.S. logistical support, Colombian government forces strafed and bombed the town for over 72 hours. In the attack, three civilians were killed, and several others were wounded as the military attacked hospitals, churches, ambulances, and residential areas. FARC rebels were forced to flee the area, and many were killed or wounded. The Colombian government claimed that this was a significant victory, while human rights groups claimed this as proof that "anti-narcotics" aid, was actually just military aid which was being used to fight a leftist insurgency.&lt;ref name="robberson-aid"&gt;Tod Robberson, [http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/puertolleras.htm "U.S. aid questioned in Colombian battle"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121090007/http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/puertolleras.htm |date=November 21, 2008 }}, ''Dallas Morning News'', 08/16/1999 (accessed: 02/27/2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000–2006===
The years from 2000–2006 were bloody ones in Colombia with thousands of deaths every year resulting from the ongoing war between the [[Colombian Armed Forces]], Paramilitary groups such as the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]] and the rebel groups (mainly the [[FARC]], [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] and also the [[Popular Liberation Army|EPL]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The fighting resulted in massive internal displacement of Colombia's civilian population and thousands of civilian deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=35&amp;regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas|title=Database – Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)|publisherucdp.uu.se=|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During President Uribe's first term in office (2002–2006), the security situation inside Colombia showed some measure of improvement and the economy, while still fragile, also showed some positive signs of recovery according to observers{{who|date=February 2017}}. But relatively little has been accomplished in structurally solving most of the country's other grave problems, such as poverty and inequality, possibly in part due to legislative and political conflicts between the administration and the [[Colombian Congress]] (including those over a controversial project to eventually give Uribe the possibility of re-election), and a relative lack of freely allocated funds and credits.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Some critical observers considered that Uribe's policies, while reducing crime and guerrilla activity, were too slanted in favor of a military solution to Colombia's internal war while neglecting grave social and human rights concerns. Critics have asked for Uribe's government to change this position and make serious efforts towards improving the human rights situation inside the country, protecting civilians and reducing any abuses committed by the armed forces. Political dissenters and labor union members, among others, have suffered from threats and have been murdered. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In 2001 the largest government supported paramilitary group, the [[Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia|AUC]], which had been linked to drug trafficking and attacks on civilians, was added to the US State Department's [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]] and the [[European Union]] and [[Canada]] soon followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2006/82738.htm|title=Chapter 6 -- Terrorist Organizations|accessdate=July 15, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109121220/http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2006/82738.htm|archivedate=January 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2002, right-wing paramilitaries entered the village of Chengue, and divided up the villagers into two groups. They then went from person to person in one of the groups, smashing each person's head with sledgehammers and rocks, killing 24 people, as the Colombian military sat by and watched. Two other bodies were later discovered dumped in a shallow grave. As the paramilitaries left, they set fire to the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside Colombia: drugs, democracy and war |author=Grace Livingstone |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2004| isbn=978-0-8135-3443-5| url=https://books.google.com/?id=cOU0bvG8ZGwC&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;dq=farc%20paramilitaries&amp;pg=PR16#v=onepage&amp;q=farc%20paramilitaries|pages=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, it was revealed by the [[National Security Archive]] that a 1991 document from the U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] had described then-Senator Uribe as a "close personal friend" and collaborator of [[Pablo Escobar]]. The Uribe administration denied several of the allegations in the 1991 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5570107/site/newsweek|title=A Harsh Light On Associate 82|accessdate=July 14, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015043408/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5570107/site/newsweek|archivedate=October 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2004 a disarmament process was begun of Colombia's paramilitary groups (especially the AUC) and was completed on April 12, 2006, when 1,700 fighters turned in their weapons in the town of Casibare.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In May 2006, the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|Colombian presidential election]] resulted in Uribe winning re-election with a historic first round vote tally of 62%, followed by leftist [[Carlos Gaviria]] with 22% and [[Horacio Serpa]].

===2007–2009===

On June 28, 2007 the FARC suddenly reported the death of 11 of the 12 kidnapped provincial deputies from [[Valle del Cauca Department]]. The [[Government of Colombia|Colombian government]] accused the FARC of executing the hostages and stated that government forces had not made any rescue attempts. FARC claimed that the deaths occurred during a crossfire, after an attack to one of its camps by an "unidentified military group".{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} FARC did not report any other casualties on either side.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6251878.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Americas – Colombia rebels 'killed hostages'|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]] and [[Senate of Colombia|Colombian Senator]] [[Piedad Córdoba]] were acting as authorised mediators in the ongoing [[humanitarian exchange|Humanitarian Exchange]] between the FARC and the government of Colombia. Colombian President [[Álvaro Uribe]] had given Chávez permission to mediate, under the conditions that all meetings with the FARC would take place in Venezuela and that Chávez would not contact members of the Colombian military directly, but instead go through proper diplomatic channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actualidadcolombiana.org/pdf/dossier_prensa_acuerdo_humanitario_nov27.pdf |title=Dossier de Información—Proceso en Busca del Acuerdo Humanitario Gobierno del Presidente Álvaro Uribe -FARC Noviembre 27 de 2007 |format=PDF |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724223518/http://www.actualidadcolombiana.org/pdf/dossier_prensa_acuerdo_humanitario_nov27.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Spanish |url=http://www.canalcaracol.com/noticia_interna.asp?hid_id_menu=77&amp;hid_id=12207 |title=Uribe terminó con mediación de Hugo Chávez |publisher=[[Caracol TV]] |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2008-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309154013/http://www.canalcaracol.com/noticia_interna.asp?hid_id_menu=77&amp;hid_id=12207 |archivedate=March 9, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, President Uribe abruptly terminated Chávez's mediation efforts on November 22, 2007, after Chávez personally contacted General [[Mario Montoya Uribe]], the Commander of the Colombian National Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |language=Spanish |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_7106000/7106863.stm |title=Uribe termina mediación de Chávez |publisher=BBC News  |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2008-03-05 |first=Hernando |last=Salazar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Chávez said that he was still willing to mediate, but had withdrawn Venezuela's ambassador to Colombia and placed Colombian-Venezuelan relations "in a freezer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Spanish |url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/11/26/elmundo/i-01549435.htm|title=Chávez acusa a Uribe de mentiroso y congela las relaciones con Colombia |publisher=El Clarín |date=2007-11-26 |accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
President Uribe responded that Colombia needed "mediation against terrorism, not for Chávez to legitimise terrorism," that Chávez was not interested in peace in Colombia, and that Chávez was building an expansionist project on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Spanish |url=http://www.telesurtv.net/secciones/noticias/nota/21184/uribe-acusa-a-chavez-de-ser-expansionista-y-de-apoyar-a-la-guerrilla-en-colombia/ |title=Uribe acusa a Chávez de ser ''expansionista'' y de apoyar a la guerilla en Colombia |publisher=Telesur |date=2007-11-25 |accessdate=2008-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228041604/http://www.telesurtv.net/secciones/noticias/nota/21184/uribe-acusa-a-chavez-de-ser-expansionista-y-de-apoyar-a-la-guerrilla-en-colombia/ |archivedate=February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scandals have affected Uribe's administration. The [[Colombian parapolitics scandal]] expanded during his second term, involving numerous members of the administration's ruling coalition. Many pro-government lawmakers, such as the President's cousin Mario Uribe, have been investigated for their possible ties to paramilitary organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7029389.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Uribe ally quits Colombia Senate | date=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2007, FARC agreed to release former senator Consuelo González, politician [[Clara Rojas]] and her son Emmanuel, born in captivity after a relationship with one of her captors. [[Operation Emmanuel]] was proposed and set up by Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]], with the permission of the Colombian government. The mission was approved on December 26. Although, on December 31, FARC claimed that the hostage release had been delayed because of Colombian military operations. On the same time, Colombian President [[Álvaro Uribe]] indicated that FARC had not freed the three hostages because Emmanuel may not be in their hands anymore.&lt;ref name="BBC_DNA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7167517.stm |title=Colombia tests 'hostage' boy DNA |publisher=BBC News  |date=January 2, 2008 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two FARC gunmen were taken prisoner. {{citation needed|date= September 2013}}

Colombian authorities added that a boy matching Emmanuel's description had been taken to a hospital in [[San José del Guaviare]] in June 2005. The child was in poor condition; one of his arms was hurt, he had severe malnutrition, and he had diseases that are commonly suffered in the jungle. Having been evidently mistreated, the boy was later sent to a foster home in Bogotá and DNA tests were announced in order to confirm his identity.&lt;ref name="BBC_DNA"/&gt;

On January 4, 2008, the results of a [[mitochondrial DNA]] test, comparing the child's DNA with that of his potential grandmother Clara de Rojas, were revealed by the Colombian government. It was reported that there was a very high probability that the boy was indeed part of the Rojas family.&lt;ref name="BBC_ColBoy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7172217.stm |title=Colombia boy may be hostage's son |publisher=BBC News  |date=January 5, 2008 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, FARC released a communique in which they admitted that Emmanuel had been taken to Bogotá and "left in the care of honest persons" for safety reasons until a humanitarian exchange took place. The group accused President Uribe of "kidnapping" the child in order to sabotage his liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7172217.stm |title=Farc admit 'hostage boy' not held |publisher=BBC News  |date=January 5, 2008 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/secciones/noticias/nota/22726/farc-anuncian-que-uribe-secuestro-a-emmanuel/ |title=teleSur: FARC anuncian que Uribe secuestró a Emmanuel |publisher=Telesurtv.net |date=November 14, 2006 |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928152531/http://www.telesurtv.net/secciones/noticias/nota/22726/farc-anuncian-que-uribe-secuestro-a-emmanuel/ |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, on January 10, 2008, FARC released Rojas and Gonzalez through a humanitarian commission headed by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].

On January 13, 2008, [[Venezuela]]n President Hugo Chávez stated his disapproval with the FARC strategy of armed struggle and kidnapping saying "I don't agree with kidnapping and I don't agree with armed struggle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN1336689820080113 |title=Hugo Chavez tells Colombian rebels to stop kidnapping |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |date=January 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He repeated his call for a political solution and an end to the war on March and June 2008, "The guerrilla war is history...At this moment in Latin America, an armed guerrilla movement is out of place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,364368,00.html |publisher=Fox News | title=Chavez Calls on Colombian Rebels to End Struggle, Free Hostages | date=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2008, [[FARC]]  released four others political hostages "as a gesture of goodwill" toward Chávez, who had brokered the deal and sent Venezuelan helicopters with [[Red Cross]] logos into the Colombian jungle to pick up the freed hostages.&lt;ref&gt;

On March 1, 2008, the [[Military of Colombia|Colombian armed forces]] launched a military operation 1.8&amp;nbsp;kilometres into [[Ecuador]] on a FARC position, killing 24, including [[Raúl Reyes]], member of the FARC [[FARC-EP Chain of Command#Secretariat|Central High Command]]. This led to the [[2008 Andean diplomatic crisis]] between Colombia and Ecuadorian President [[Rafael Correa]], supported by Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]].  On March 3, [[Iván Ríos]], also a member of the FARC [[FARC-EP Chain of Command#Secretariat|Central High Command]] was killed by his security chief "Rojas".  In March 2008 alone, FARC lost 3 members of their Secretariat, including their founder.

On May 24, 2008, Colombian magazine, ''[[Revista Semana]]'', published an interview with Colombian defense minister [[Juan Manuel Santos]] in which Santos mentions the death of [[Manuel Marulanda Vélez]]. The news was confirmed by FARC-commander '[[Timoleón Jiménez|Timochenko]]' on Venezuelan based television station Telesur on May 25, 2008. 'Timochenko' announced the new commander in chief is '[[Alfonso Cano]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://colombiareports.com/2008/05/25/farc-admits-death-of-manuel-marandula/ |title=FARC confirm death of 'Manuel Marulanda' |date=May 25, 2008 |publisher=Colombia Reports }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, a dozen jailed paramilitary leaders were extradited to the United States on drug-related charges. In 2009, extradited paramilitary leader [[Salvatore Mancuso]] would claim that the AUC had supported Uribe's 2002 election, but said that this was a result of their similar "ideological discourse" and not the result of any direct prior arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/4258-auc-supported-uribes-election-mancuso.html |title=AUC supported Uribe's election: Mancuso – Colombia news |publisher=Colombia Reports |date=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 2008, the [[Military of Colombia|Colombian armed forces]] launched [[Operation Jaque]] that resulted in the freedom of 15 political hostages, including former Colombian presidential candidate [[Íngrid Betancourt]], [[Marc Gonsalves]], [[Thomas Howes (hostage)|Thomas Howes]], and [[Keith Stansell]], three American military contractors employed by [[Northrop Grumman]]&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |title= Betancourt, U.S. contractors rescued from FARC |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/07/02/betancourt.colombia/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2008-07-02 |accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 11 Colombian military and police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Betancourt, 14 others freed by Colombian forces |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/americas/news/article_1414668.php/Betancourt_14_others_freed_by_Colombian_forces__3rd_Lead_ |publisher=Monsters and Critics |date=2008-07-02 |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710114339/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/americas/news/article_1414668.php/Betancourt_14_others_freed_by_Colombian_forces__3rd_Lead_ |archivedate=July 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two FARC members were arrested.

On October 26, 2008, after 8 years of captivity, the ex-congressman [[Óscar Tulio Lizcano]] escaped with the assistance of a FARC rebel he convinced to travel with him. Soon after the liberation of this prominent political hostage, the [[Vice President of Colombia]] [[Francisco Santos Calderón]] called Latin America's biggest guerrilla group a "[[paper tiger]]" with little control of the nation's territory, adding that "they have really been diminished to the point where we can say they are a minimal threat to Colombian security," and that "After six years of going after them, reducing their income and promoting reinsertion of most of their members, they look like a paper tiger." However, he warned against any kind of premature triumphalism, because "crushing the rebels will take time." The {{convert|500000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} of jungle in Colombia makes it hard to track them down to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy |first=Helen |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=aCsN3xsYNI0M&amp;refer=latin_america |title=FARC Is a `Paper Tiger' After Offensive, Desertions (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=October 29, 2008 |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626150025/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=aCsN3xsYNI0M&amp;refer=latin_america |archivedate=June 26, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Colombian government, in early 2009 FARC launched plan ''Rebirth'' to avoid being defeated. They planned to intensify [[guerrilla warfare]] by the use of [[landmine]]s, snipers, and bomb attacks in urban areas. They also plan to buy missiles to fight the Colombian airforce which highly contribute to their weakness since few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/2928-farc-launch-rebirth-plan.html |title=FARC launch 'Rebirth' plan: intelligence – Colombia news |publisher=Colombia Reports |date=February 17, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the guerrilla released 6 hostages as a humanitarian gesture. In March, they released Swedish hostage Erik Roland Larsson. {{citation needed|date= September 2013}}

During the fighting, a teenager was killed in the crossfire.&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net"/&gt;

When [[Juan Manuel Santos]] was elected president in August 2010, he promised to "continue the armed offensive" against rebel movements. In the month after his inauguration, FARC and ELN killed roughly 50 soldiers and policemen in attacks all over Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFN1025921520100910 |title=Colombian rebel attacks intensify, dozens killed &amp;#124; Energy &amp; Oil &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Af.reuters.com |date=September 10, 2010 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; September also saw the killing of FARC's second-in-command Mono Jojoy. By the end of 2010, it became increasingly clear that "neo-paramilitary groups", referred to as "criminal groups" (BACRIM) by the government, had become an increasing threat to national security, with violent groups such as [[Los Rastrojos]] and [[Aguilas Negras]] taking control of large parts of the Colombian countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDermott |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12804418 |title=BBC News – Colombia's criminal bands pose new security challenge |publisher=BBC  |date=April 25, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== FARC dissidents ==

== Economic Impact ==

=== Direct Economic Effects ===

==== Physical Infrastructure ====
The destruction of physical infrastructure has represented high costs for several sectors of the economy, directly altering production and distribution networks. The costs generated by damage to the oil infrastructure have shown a substantial increase since 1990. This is mainly explained by the increase in attacks on oil pipelines by groups outside the law. According to data from [[Ecopetrol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borrego, M. E. P., Ballen, A. V., &amp; Percipiano, Y. L.|first=|date=2005|title=Costos Generados por la violencia armada en Colombia|url=|journal=Departamento Nacional de Planeacion|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1999 and 2003, the costs assumed by the hydrocarbon exploitation sector grew by approximately 59%, amounting to $817,654.5 million. This equates to 23.6% of the total royalties that [[Ecopetrol]] turned to 20 departments and 110 municipalities, destined to improve the quality of life of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecopetrol.como.co/especiales/informe_anual2003/images/informer-anual-esp-alta-72.pdf|title=Informe Anual 2003|last=|first=|date=|website=Ecopetrol|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2004, costs decreased substantially to $11,015.5 million. This is the first sector most affected by the terrorist actions of groups outside the law. The costs are mainly derived from the spilled oil, "[...] from the repair of the pipeline, from the environmental decontamination and from the oil stopped producing 60% of the total expenses incurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granada y Rojas|first=|date=1995|title=Los Costos Economicos del Conflicto armado en Colombia: 1990-1994|url=|journal=Archivos de Macroeconomia. Departamento Nacional de Planeacion|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1999-2003 period, costs against electrical and telecommunications towers increased substantially, representing $134,871.2 million. This is equivalent to 5.4% of 2003 GDP for the electricity, gas and water sector.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Otero, D.|first=|date=2007|title=Las Cifras del Conflicto Colombiano|url=|journal=Instituto de Estudios para el Desarrollo y la Paz|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, according to data from the National Institute of Roads ([[INVÍAS]]), between 1993-1995, groups outside the law demolished eleven tolls and a bridge, and its reconstruction cost $378,476,248. This amount increased significantly during the 1999-2003 period, when the costs generated by the reconstruction of bridges represented $18,455.7 million. These costs are equivalent to 1.71% of the total INVÍAS budget for 2003. For 2004, costs for damages to the road infrastructure dropped substantially to $680 million.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The partial interruption of the roads directly affects the transport sector, food and other private guilds, which in turn assume costs for these damages. However, generally these have not been quantified, because of the difficulty they have to be directly calculated. This tends to present itself as a generalized problem in quantifying the costs associated with conflict. This is explained, in part, by the tendency in the various economic sectors not to denounce this type of actions that, in one way or another, interrupt the normal functioning of economic activities.

==== The costs of kidnaps and extortions ====
[[Colombia]] is the country in which more people are and have been kidnapped.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kidnapping, as one of the manifestations that underlie the armed conflict, carries both direct and indirect costs. The former comprise mainly the payment of ransoms and the expenses assumed by the State to control and prevent it. Indirect costs include,  "[...] the loss of human capital for the duration of the detention and for the death of the kidnapped during his captivity".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinto, Vergara, Lahuerta|first=|date=2004|title=Costos generados por la violencia armada en Colombia: 1999-2003|url=|journal=Archivos de Macroeconomia: Departamento Nacional de Planeacion|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of kidnapping: a) kidnapping for extortion and political purposes; and b) simple kidnapping. According to data from the Directorate of Justice and Security of the [https://www.dnp.gov.co/Paginas/inicio.aspx DNP], this phenomenon shows an increasing trend. With respect to the costs of sequestration, the sources suggest an increasing behavior between 1996 and 2003. In such a way that "the average annual growth rate is 9.3%, the highest rate is observed in 1998 (46.2%), and in 2000 (37.2%) year in which the number of kidnappings also it is significantly high [...] reaching its peak in the year 2000 with 1,938 cases."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinto, M.

Cepeda|first=|date=2004|title=El secuestro en Colombia caracterizacion y costos economicos|url=|journal=Archivos de Economia: Documento 257, Departamento Nacional de Planeacion|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, the trend becomes decreasing (except for a peak in 2002 with 1,542 cases) until reaching the 350 kidnappings (the lowest figure since 1996) in 2005. Within these costs, 64.4% are direct, representing US $167.4 million. 35.6% of the remaining costs are indirect, and represent US $92.7 million. In 2004, the costs of sequestration were reduced to $109,519 million, representing 0.27% of GDP in 2003.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Costs of Defense and National Security ====
While spending on defense and security becomes very important to examine when dealing with a country immersed in an armed conflict, the analysis on this issue are relatively recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urrutia, N.|first=|date=2004|title=El gasto en defensa y seguridad: caracterizacion del caso colombiano en el contexto internacional.|url=|journal=Archivos de Economia, Documento 249, Departamento Nacional de Planeacion|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained because until the beginning of the second half of the nineties, defense and security spending had a significant growth. Spending on defense and security includes, on the one hand, the means by which the State must have to defend sovereignty and territorial integrity, and on the other, the costs involved in maintaining internal security. Various studies of [https://www.dnp.gov.co/Paginas/inicio.aspx National Planning] suggest that the Colombian State spends a much greater percentage in defense and security than other Latin American countries. Between 1991-1996, the estimated value of these resources was $3.7 billion. That is, 2.6% of GDP, while for Latin America the average of this expenditure was 1.7% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trujillo, C y M. Badel|first=|date=1998|title=Los Costos Economicos de la criminalidad y la violencia en Colombia: 1991-1996|url=|journal=Archivos de Macroeconomia, Departamento Nacional de Planeacion|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study carried out by the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI) for the year 2001 "[...] shows that Colombia ranked 24th in the countries with the largest participation in military spending, out of a total of 116 investigated."The figure for the participation of military expenditures in GDP was 3.8% for Colombia while in the countries of the American continent the closest figure is that of the United States with 3.1% followed by Chile with 2.9%, Ecuador with 2.1% and the rest of countries below 2.0% ".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, for the period 1999-2003, defense and security spending was $8,463,611.0 million, equivalent to 10.5% of GDP in 2003. The excess of said expense, compared to the average cost of neighboring countries, It was close to 0.79% of GDP. A [https://www.fedesarrollo.org.co/ Fedesarrollo] study states that the Spending on defense and security carried out during 2004 "[...] represented 4.5% of GDP [...] "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cardenas, M., X.

Fundacion Seguridad y Democracia.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which does not have precedents in the history of [[Colombia]]. This is directly related to the [[:es:Política de seguridad democrática|Security Policy Democratic]] undertaken by the government of the current president [[Álvaro Uribe]], who focuses on hitting militarily to groups outside the law, in order to regain security national. On the other hand, for the year 2004, the expenses of the Colombian Government in war and security were 6.59%, placing the country between the tenth that invest the most in war as proportion of GDP .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Indirect Economic Effects ===

==== Productivity Loss ====
The estimated loss of human capital and productivity due to labor absenteeism in 2003  amounted to $366.2 billion".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the other hand, the loss of land productivity, which translates into a negative impact on administration, investment in physical and social capital, and the price of land in subsectors such as livestock and commercial agriculture is one of the consequences associated with the presence of an armed conflict.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Echandia, C|first=|date=1997|title=Expansion territorial de la guerrilla colombiana: geografia, economia y violencia|url=|journal=Programa de Estudios sobre Seguridad, Justicia y Violencia. Universidad de los Andes|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cost is mainly assumed by farmers who experience the pressure of armed actions in their areas of operation. Within this context, the most serious consequences are related to the devaluation of the properties, the loss of productivity of the land -represented in the products that could potentially have been cultivated in these lands- and the difficulty in managing the efficient production of the lands. According to a study of National Planning, the estimated costs for the loss of productivity of land represented, between 1999 and 2003, $140,443.5 million,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; equivalent to 1.28% of the GDP of the agricultural sector of 2003.

==== Impact on income distribution ====
The duration and expansion of the national conflict has had a significant impact on the distribution of income and wealth in Colombia. According to an investigation by the CEDE of the [[University of Los Andes (Colombia)|Universidad de los Andes]], "as a result of the displacement, the displaced households have left behind a little more than four million hectares, which correspond to 6.7 times of the total hectares granted by the program. of Agrarian Reform during the period between 1993 and 2000, and represent a total value of $ 2.6 billion." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibanez, A., A.

Velasquez|first=|date=2006|title=Hacia una politica proactiva de la poblacion desplazada|url=|journal=Universidad de los Andes, Secretariado Nacional de Pastoral Social Caritas Colombia|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the enormous concentration of rural property in the hands of a few individuals is not only the result of the purchase of land by drug traffickers and the illegal appropriation by groups outside the law, but also the consequence of acquisition of properties devalued due to the armed conflict [...]. It is estimated that 1.3% of the owners control 48% of the best lands.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On the other hand, a study carried out by the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP) states that the Colombian conflict has had a negative effect on the income of the population. According to this study, because of the conflict, Colombia has lost 17% of its per capita income in the last ten years. That is to say, "[...] the money wasted every year corresponds to about 4.6 times what the community welfare homes programs, children's homes and school restaurants of the social support network cos."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo|first=|date=2003|title=El conflicto, callejon con salida: informe nacional de desarrollo humano para Colombia|url=|journal=PNUD|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Decrease in investments ====
Although the agents adjust their investment behavior, that is, they internalize the phenomenon of violence, assuming it as a change in the structures of the economy&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Echeverry, J., N. Salazar y V. Navas|first=|date=2001|title=Nos parecemos al resto del mundo? El conflicto Colombiano en el contexto internacional.|url=|journal=Archivos de Macroeconomia, Documento 143, Departamento Nacional de Planeacion|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the long term the investment of both the State and the private sector is diminished in substantial ways. In the Colombian case, the loss in private investment has been estimated at 0.53 points of the annual GDP, due to the public order conditions that arise directly from the presence of an armed conflict. A 1% increase in the homicide rate reduces private investment by 0.66%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parra, C.|first=|date=1998|title=Determinantes de la Inversion en Colombia: evidencia sobre el capital humano y la violencia|url=|journal=Planeacion y Desarrollo|volume=84|pages=1–31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we can observe that the high levels of violence directly affect the transaction costs and levels of uncertainty in society. Likewise, they reduce to a certain degree the profitability of investments. A study by Corporación Invertir en Colombia ([http://www.coinvertir.org/ Coinvertir]) and the National Planning Department (DNP) shows that insecurity hinders the development of new foreign investments, especially in the financial, oil and gas, and electric power sectors.

One of the biggest problems to invest in Colombia is that it is necessary to devote a large part of the budget to security and protection controls, which is very difficult to justify before the house. In this sense, the economic environment affected by the violence translates into a tax on investment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Echeverry, J., N. Salazar y V. Navas.|first=|date=2001|title=Nos parecemos al resto del mundo? El conflicto colombiano en el contexto internacional|url=|journal=Archivos de Macroeconomia, Documento 143, Departamento Nacional de Planeacion|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it should be noted that within the studies on the costs of the conflict, specific sectors such as the private sector have begun to be studied, taking into account the high costs they have had to assume due to the existence of this phenomenon. The large companies and those that operate at the national level assume the highest costs associated with the existence of the conflict. This is because they are more attractive for someone who wants to extort for example, and also those who lose most in adverse conditions. Appealing to the economic arguments that underlie the conflict, various state and international aid and cooperation institutions seek to establish the scope and potential benefits of a peaceful situation. This argument has mobilized and sensitized various sectors of society to understand that peace is also an economic necessity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In Colombia, as shown in the studies that have estimated the costs of the conflict, since the nineties it has imposed increasingly higher costs to various productive sectors of the economy and society in general.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Among the sectors most affected by the conflict are the exploitation of hydrocarbons, electricity and livestock. This is explained, in part, because the areas where the operations and activities of these sectors take place, in parallel, are the territories where groups outside the law exert a very strong presence. Likewise, for the Colombian private sector, indirect costs have more impact on their activities than direct costs. With respect to indirect costs, although there is a clear difficulty to be quantified, the various studies suggest that they have been significantly high and that they have had a representative impact on society as such.

Multinational corporations have also been directly tied to paramilitary death squads. [[Chiquita Brands International]] was fined $25 million as part of a settlement with the United States Justice Department for having ties to paramilitary groups.&lt;ref name = "International actors"/&gt; In 2016, Judge [[Kenneth Marra]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida|Southern District of Florida]] ruled in favor of allowing Colombians to sue former Chiquita Brand International executives for the company's funding of the outlawed right-wing paramilitary organization that murdered their family members.

== Statistics about victims of war ==
[[File:Centro de Memoria Histórica - Bogotá.jpg|thumb|The Axis of Peace and Memory: A "memorial" to the victims of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://centromemoria.gov.co/eje-de-la-paz-y-la-memoria/| title = The Axis of Peace and Memory|publisher =centromemoria.gov.co}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Colombia, the 9th of April is a symbolic day. It is a day of remembrance and [[solidarity]] with the conflict's victims.&lt;ref name="Victims Law" /&gt;]]

According to a study by [[National Center for Historical Memory|Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory]], 220,000 people have died in the conflict between 1958 and 2013, most of them civilians (177,307 civilians and 40,787 fighters) and more than five million civilians were forced from their homes between 1985 – 2012, generating the world's second largest population of [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs). The report shows that the humanitarian crisis in Colombia is extremely serious in terms of both lethal and nonlethal violence. The report examines the widespread use of sexual violence against women and girls as a weapon of war, as well as the invisibility of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="estadisticas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enough Already!"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"/&gt; 16.9% of the population in Colombia has been a direct victim of the war.&lt;ref name="arcoiris.com.co"/&gt;

2.3 million children have been displaced from their homes, and 45,000 children killed, according to national figures cited by [[Unicef]]. In total, one in three of the 7.6 million registered victims of the conflict are children, and since 1985, 8,000 minors have disappeared. Since the peace talks with the FARC began four years ago, some 1,000 children have been forcibly recruited by some of the myriad armed groups in the country, 75 have been killed, and 65 schools have been damaged by fighting.&lt;ref name=" Multi-Generation War"/&gt;

According to the report "Basta ya", written in 2013 by Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory, 80% of victims affected by conflict-related violence and landmines were civilians. The report documents 1,982 massacres between 1980 and 2012.&lt;ref name="Enough Already!"/&gt;

The Government also began a process of assistance, attention and comprehensive reparation for victims of conflict.&lt;ref name="Victims Law"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unidadvictimas.gov.co/normatividad/LEY+DE+VICTIMAS.pdf |title=The Victims and Land Restitution Law |publisher=unidadvictimas.gov.co |accessdate=21 December 2014 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925110822/http://www.unidadvictimas.gov.co/normatividad/LEY%2BDE%2BVICTIMAS.pdf |archivedate=September 25, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://restituciondetierras.gov.co/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305121426/http://restituciondetierras.gov.co/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 March 2013 |title=the Land Restitution Unit |publisher=restituciondetierras.gov.co |accessdate=23 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his visit to Colombia, [[Pope Francis]] brought with him a message of peace and paid tribute to the victims of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/09/08/pope_at_colombia_prayer_meeting_for_reconciliation_weeps_wit/1335635 |title=Pope at Colombia prayer meeting for reconciliation weeps with victims |date=2017-09-08 |website=radiovaticana.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Special Jurisdiction for Peace''' (''Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz'', JEP) would be the transitional justice component of the Comprehensive System, complying with Colombia's duty to investigate, clarify, prosecute and punish serious [[human rights]] violations and grave breaches of [[international humanitarian law]] which occurred during the armed conflict. Its objectives would be to satisfy victims' right to [[justice]], offer truth to the public, contribute to the reparation of victims, contribute to the fight against impunity, adopt decisions which give full legal security to direct and indirect participants in the conflict and contribute to the achievement of a stable and lasting peace.&lt;ref name="abcjep"&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz|url=http://www.altocomisionadoparalapaz.gov.co/Documents/informes-especiales/abc-del-proceso-de-paz/abc-jurisdiccion-especial-paz.html|publisher=Oficina del Alto Comisionado para la Paz|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Special Unit for the Search of Missing Persons in the context and due to the armed conflict (''Unidad especial para la búsqueda de personas dadas por desaparecidas en el contexto y en razón del conflicto armado'') would be a special high-level unit created following the signature of the [[Colombian peace process|final agreement]]. It would direct and coordinate efforts to search for and locate missing persons, or find their remains so that they may be returned to their families. To carry out its work, the search unit would collect the necessary information about missing persons, analyze the information collected, strengthen and streamline processes for identifying mortal remains in coordination with the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, guarantee families' participation and present an official report to families informing them of the fate of missing relatives.&lt;ref name="victimsagreementfarc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Agreement Victims|url=http://farc-epeace.org/peace-process/agreements/agreements/item/939-agreement-victims|publisher=FARC-EP International|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The search unit would be administrative and financially independent and autonomous, complementing the other components of the Comprehensive System.

==Use of land mines==
Since 1990, over 11,000 people have been killed or wounded by [[landmines]] in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-31831002 Natalio Cosoy, "Clearing Colombia of landmines," ''BBC Mundo,'' Bogota, 14 March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Making-a-difference/Change-Agent/2013/0130/Removing-Colombia-s-landmines-one-by-one|title=Removing Colombia's landmines, one by one|date=January 30, 2013|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1982 and the end of 2012, 2,038 people have been killed by landmines, according to the Presidential Program for Mine Action.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Since 2000, casualties from landmines in Colombia have ranged from 1,300 a year to just around 550.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/cp/display/region_profiles/theme/2523|title=Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor|publisher=The-monitor.org|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the Colombian government laid landmines around 34 military bases to protect key infrastructure, but it renounced their use in 1997. Landmines are primarily used by the rebel groups to protect their home bases and illegal drug crops, which fund the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/13.1/profiles/colombia/colombia.shtml Leah Young, "Colombia," ''Journal of ERW and Mine Action,'' Issue 13.1, Summer 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; FARC and ELN have deployed antipersonnel mines throughout an estimated area of up to 100 square kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/landmines-killing-colombians-lend-leg-support-victims/story?id=18870182|title=Landmines Are Killing Colombians, "Lend Your Leg" to Support Victims – ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, FARC stated that it would begin humanitarian demining in selected parts of Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/FARC-to-Start-Humanitarian-Removal-of-Landmines-in-Colombia-20150323-0003.html "FARC to Start 'Humanitarian' Removal of Landmines in Colombia."

Given the lack of population records prior to the 1950s, there are many gaps in our record of demographic history. Historical demographers must make do with estimates. models and extrapolations.  For the methodology, see [[Historical demography]]

==Historical population of the world==
{{see also|World population estimates}}
[[File:World population growth (lin-log scale).png|thumb|400px|Population of the world from 10,000 BC to 2000 AD (logarithmic scale)]]

Estimating the ancestral population of [[anatomically modern humans]], [[Colin McEvedy]] and [[Richard Jones (disambiguation)#Other occupations|Richard Jones]] chose bounds based on [[gorilla]] and [[chimpanzee]] population densities of 1/km² and 3-4/km²,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEvedy |first=Colin |title=[[Atlas of World Population History]] |date=June 29, 1978 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, then assumed that as ''[[Homo erectus]]'' moved up the food chain, they lost an order of magnitude in density. With a habitat of 68 million km² ("the [[Old World]] south of latitude 50° north, minus [[Australia]]"), ''Homo erectus'' could have numbered around 1.7 million individuals. After being replaced by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and moving into the [[New World]] and de-glaciated territory, by 10,000 BC world population was approaching four million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEvedy |first=Colin |title=[[Atlas of World Population History]] |date=June 29, 1978 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; McEvedy and Jones argue that, after populating the maximum available range, this was the limit of our [[Hunter-gatherer|food-gathering]] ancestors, with further population growth requiring [[Neolithic Revolution|food-producing]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEvedy |first=Colin |title=[[Atlas of World Population History]] |date=June 29, 1978 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial population "upswing" began around 5000 BC. Global population gained 50% in the 5th millennium BC, and 100% each millennium until 1000 BC, reaching 50 million people. After the beginning of the [[Iron Age]], growth rate reached its peak with a [[doubling time]] of 500 years. However, growth slackened between 500 BC and 1 AD, before ceasing around 200 AD. This "primary cycle" was, at this time in history, confined to [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and mainland [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEvedy |first=Colin |title=[[Atlas of World Population History]] |date=June 29, 1978 |page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; McEvedy and Jones describe a secondary, "medieval cycle" being led by [[Feudalism|feudal Europe]] and [[Song dynasty|Song China]] from around 900 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEvedy |first=Colin |title=[[Atlas of World Population History]] |date=June 29, 1978 |page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period from 500 to 900 [[world population]] grew slowly but the growth rate accelerated between 900 and 1300 when the population doubled. During the 14th century, there was a fall in population associated with the [[Black Death]] that spread from [[Asia]] to [[Europe]]. This was followed by a period of restrained growth for 300 years.&lt;ref name="EoPH"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/historical-demography Historical Demography] in [[Encyclopedia of Public Health]], Retrieved on 3 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century world population entered a period of accelerated growth. European population reached a peak growth rate of 10 per thousand per year in the second half of the 19th century. During the 20th century, the growth rate among the European populations fell and was overtaken by a rapid acceleration in the growth rate in other continents, which reached 21 per thousand per year in the last 50 years of the millennium. Between 1900 and 2000, the population of the world increased by 277%, a fourfold increase from 1.5 billion to 6 billion. The European component increased by 124%, and the remainder by 349%.&lt;ref name="EoPH"/&gt;

The Indian population was about 100 million in 1500. Under the [[Mughal Empire]], the population rose to 160 million in 1700.&lt;ref name="mcevedy184"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Colin McEvedy |author-link1=Colin McEvedy |author2=Richard Jones |date=1978 |title=Atlas of World Population History |publisher=[[Facts on File]] |location=New York |pages=184-185 |url=http://www.arabgeographers.net/up/uploads/14299936761.pdf#page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mughal India]] had a relatively high degree of [[urbanization]] for its time, with 15% of its population living in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the urban population in contemporary Europe at the time and higher than that of [[British India]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="eraly"&gt;[[Abraham Eraly]] (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zpa8gyGW_twC&amp;pg=PA5 ''The Mughal World: Life in India's Last Golden Age'', page 5], [[Penguin Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[British Raj]], the population reached 255 million according to the [[1881 Census of India|census taken in 1881]].&lt;ref&gt;Anatole Romaniuk, "Glimpses of Indian Historical Demography." Canadian Studies in Population 40.3-4 (2014): 248-251. [https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/csp/article/download/21301/16105 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parameswara Krishnan, ''Glimpses of Indian Historical Demography'' (Delhi: B.R. Publishing Corporation 2010) {{ISBN|978-8176466387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kingsley Davis, ''The Population of India and Pakistan'' (Princeton University Press, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kingsley Davis, "The population of India." ''Far Eastern Survey'' (1943): 76-79. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3022159 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of India's population since 1881 have focused on such topics as total population, birth and death rates, growth rates, geographic distribution, literacy, the rural and urban divide, cities of a million, and the three cities with populations over eight million: Delhi, Greater Mumbai (Bombay), and Kolkata (Calcutta).&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Khan,  "Population growth and demographic change in India," ''Asian Profile'' (2004) 32#5 pp 441-460&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortality rates fell in 1920-45 era, primarily due to biological immunization. Other factors included rising incomes and better living conditions, improved better nutrition, a safer and cleaner environmental, and better official health policies and medical care.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Klein, "Population growth and mortality in British India: Part II: The demographic revolution," ''Indian Economic Social History Review'' (1990) 27#1 pp 33-63 doi: 10.1177/001946469002700102 [http://ier.sagepub.com/content/27/1/33 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe overcrowding in the cities caused major public health problems, as noted in an official report from 1938:&lt;ref&gt;Klein, "Population growth and mortality in British India: Part II: The demographic revolution," p 42&lt;/ref&gt;
:In the urban and industrial areas ... cramped sites, the high values of land and the necessity for the worker to live in the vicinity of his work ... all tend to intensify congestion and overcrowding. In the busiest centres houses are built close together, eave touching eave, and frequently back to back .... Indeed space is so valuable that, in place of streets and roads, winding lanes provide the only approach to the houses. Neglect of sanitation is often evidenced by heaps of rotting garbage and pools of sewage, whilst the absence of latrines enhance the general pollution of air and soil.

==Early modern Europe==

[[Karl Julius Beloch]] estimated the population of early modern Europe, circa 1600, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Julius Beloch, "Die Bevölkerung Europas zur Zeit der Renaissance" in ''Zeitschrift für Socialwissenschaft'', 1900, pp. 765 to 786.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Italy, 13,000,000
*Spain and Portugal, 10,000,000
*France, 16,000,000, in its boundaries in 1600&lt;ref&gt;Beloch gives it an area of 470,000 km2, too small for France in 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;
*England and Wales, 4,500,000
*Scotland and Ireland, 2,000,000
*Netherlands, 3,000,000, including the Spanish Netherlands in 1600&lt;ref&gt;Beloch gives it an area of 75,000 km2, enough to include Belgium and possibly even Luxemburg.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Denmark, 600,000
*Sweden, Norway, and Finland: 1,400,000
*Poland with Prussia: 3,000,000
*Germany: 20,000,000, probably including most or all of the territory of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] outside Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Beloch gives it an area of 720,000 km2, about twice the size of modern Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II''' was a multinational celebration throughout 2012, that marked the 60th anniversary of the accession of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on 6 February 1952. Queen Elizabeth is [[queen regnant]] of 16 sovereign states, known as [[Commonwealth realm]]s, including the United Kingdom. The only other time in British history that a monarch celebrated a [[Diamond jubilee|Diamond Jubilee]] was in 1897, when [[Queen_Victoria#Diamond_Jubilee|Queen Victoria  celebrated hers]].

Commemorative events were held throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Unlike the Queen's [[Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II|Silver]] and [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilees]], when the Queen toured most of her realms around the world, Elizabeth II and her husband the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], toured only the United Kingdom. Other parts of the Commonwealth were toured by her children and grandchildren as her representatives.

===Saint Vincent and the Grenadines===
In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a Diamond Jubilee Celebrations Committee was established to oversee events staged to mark, between February and June 2012, the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II's accession as queen regnant of the country, from 1952 to 1979 as [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]] and thereafter as [[Monarchy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Queen of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. The committee head, former Minister of Culture Rene Baptiste, stated the aim was to "showcase what we have to offer, as well as our loyalty to the Parliament..." The Earl and Countess of Wessex, aboard [[RFA Fort Rosalie (A385)|RFA ''Fort Rosalie'']], arrived for their tour of country on 25 February and visited the restored [[Botanic Gardens St. Vincent]] and planted a Pink Poui tree, attended an official lunch at Government House, and planted [[Roystonea|Royal Palms]] on the [[Grenadines]].

Trade unionist Noel Jackson said he heard displeasure expressed by Vincentians towards the royal tour and that "a lot of people were cursing." Senator Julian Francis, the General Secretary of the governing [[Unity Labour Party]], stated the public reaction to the presence of the royal couple "confirmed to me that we could not have won [[Vincentian constitutional referendum, 2009|the 2009 referendum on a republic]]. The outpouring of the people in St. Vincent to come and greet Prince Edward yesterday confirmed to me that people, in the majority in St. Vincent, still want the monarchy... It was like a carnival in town yesterday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://i-witness-news.com/2012/02/27/majority-of-vincentians-still-want-the-monarchy/| title=Majority of Vincentians 'still want the monarchy'| date=27 February 2012| publisher=I-Witness News| accessdate=28 February 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301110030/http://i-witness-news.com/2012/02/27/majority-of-vincentians-still-want-the-monarchy/| archivedate=1 March 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Diamond Jubilee Lecture was delivered in March, a flower show and tea party was held at Government House on 4 and 5 May, a stamp exhibition was mounted at the National Trust headquarters and an exhibition of photographs of the Queen in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was displayed at the National Public Library. A Queen's Birthday parade took place, as did a Diamond Jubilee Beacon Event on 4 June, part of the wider plan to light such beacons at the same time across the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thevincentian.com/dcmain.aspx?p=0&amp;i=9355&amp;skin=75&amp;tID=198 |last=Clarke |first=Karissa |title=Big plans to mark Queen's Diamond Jubilee |date=2 February 2012 |newspaper=The Vincentian |accessdate=5 February 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Digital Classicist''' is a community of those interested in the application of [[Digital Humanities]] to the field of [[Classics]] and to ancient world studies more generally. The project claims the twin aims of bringing together scholars and students with an interest in computing and the ancient world, and disseminating advice and experience to the Classics discipline at large.&lt;ref&gt;See Bodard &amp; Garcés, (2005), 'The Digital Classicist', (poster), delivered at Digital Resources for the Humanities conference, University of Lancaster, September 2005. http://www.drh.org.uk/drh2005-abstracts.pdf (Poster won first prize in the poster competition.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Digital Classicist was founded in 2005 as a collaborative project based at [[King's College London]] and the [[University of Kentucky]], with editors and advisors from the Classics discipline at large.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0506&amp;L=digitalclassicist&amp;P=361 for the initial announcement and discussion of the project's charter&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities of The Digital Classicist==

===Membership===

Many notable Classicists and Digital Humanists are on the advisory board of the Digital Classicist, including Richard Beacham (of the King's [[Scientific visualization|Visualisation]] Lab), Alan Bowman (Professor of [[Ancient History]] at [[University of Oxford]]), Gregory Crane (of the [[Perseus Project]]), Bernard Frischer (of the Virtual World Heritage Laboratory), [[Michael Fulford]] (Professor of [[Archaeology]] and Pro-Vice-Chancellor at [[University of Reading]]), Willard McCarty (winner of the [[Richard Wall Lyman|Lyman Award]] and Professor of Humanities Computing at [[Department of Digital Humanities]]), James O'Donnell (Provost of [[Georgetown University]]), Silvio Panciera (of [[University of Rome La Sapienza]]) and [[Boris Rankov]] (Professor of Ancient History at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]]).  A former member was the late [[Ross Scaife]] (Stoa Consortium and [[University of Kentucky]]).

===Blog===

The Digital Classicist community have taken an active role in posting news to the long-standing blog of the [[Stoa Consortium]], which concerns itself with both Classical and Digital Humanities topics. A particular focus seems to be the [[Open Source]] and [[Creative Commons]] movements, and various communities of scholars with digital interests.

===Discussion list===

The Digital Classicist discussion list is hosted by JISCmail in the UK. Most list traffic consists of announcements and calls, with occasional flurries of more involved discussion.&lt;ref&gt;See archives at http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/digitalclassicist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wiki===

The main website of the Digital Classicist is a gateway containing links to the Digital Classicist [[Wiki]] and other resources, including listings for seminars and conference panels. The seminar programmes include: abstract, slides (in pdf), audio (in mp3) and, from 2013, video recordings.

The project Wiki contains lists of digital Classics projects, software tools that have been made available for classicists, and a [[FAQ]] that solicits collaborative community advice on a range of topics from simple questions about, e.g., Greek fonts and [[Unicode]], word-processing and printing issues, to more advanced [[Humanities Computing]] questions and project management advice. The Wiki is hosted on the servers of the [[Centre for Computing in the Humanities]] at [[King's College London]]&lt;ref&gt;See http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seminars and Publications===

The members of the Digital Classicist community also report quite heavily on any conference and seminar activity that they take to reflect well on the project as a whole. Among the events cited are a series of summer seminars which have run each year since 2006 at the [[Institute of Classical Studies]] in London, and panels at the [[Classical Association]] Annual Conference in Birmingham 2007&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip and http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Current_events on Digital Classicist events, and http://www.ca2007.bham.ac.uk/programme-revised-feb07.pdf on the Classical Association conference (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow 2009, and Durham 2011&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.dur.ac.uk/classics/events/ca_conference2011/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Digital Resources in the Humanities and Arts]] conference in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.drh.org.uk/ DRHA] and especially http://www.rsd.cam.ac.uk/drha08/assets/docs/DRHAProgramme08.pdf for the DRHA 2008 programme&lt;/ref&gt; The Project was also among the sponsors of the [[Open Source Critical Editions]] workshop in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/activities/act9.html; the proceedings of this workshop are said to be in preparation for publication.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008 the [[Digital Medievalist]] published a collaborative issue of Digital Classicist articles in memory of [[Ross Scaife]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/4/&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of papers from the 2007 seminar series and conference panels have been published by Ashgate: ''Digital Research in the Study of Classical Antiquity'' (Bodard and Mahony (eds) 2010).&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754677734&lt;/ref&gt; More recent papers have been collected together in a ''Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies'': Mahony and Dunn (eds) 2013''The Digital Classicist 2013'' (2013) London BICS Supplement-122 Institute of Classical Studies.&lt;ref&gt;See http://events.sas.ac.uk/icls/publications/1014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">'''George Kedrenos''' or '''Cedrenus''' ({{lang-el|Γεώργιος Κεδρηνός}}, fl. 11th century) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian. In the 1050s he compiled ''Synopsis historion'' (also known as ''A concise history of the world''), which spanned the time from the [[Bible|biblical]] [[Genesis creation myth|account of creation]] to his own day. Kedrenos is one of the few sources that discuss [[Khazar]] polities in existence after the sack of [[Atil]] in 969 (see [[Georgius Tzul]]).

Material in ''Synopsis historion'' mostly comes from the works by [[Pseudo-Symeon Magistros]]{{sup|[[:de:Pseudo-symeon|(de)]]}} (a version of [[Symeon the Metaphrast|Logothete]]'s [[Logothete's chronicle|chronicle]]{{sup|[[:de:Logothetenchronik|(de)]]}}), [[George Syncellus]], [[Theophanes the Confessor]], and, starting from 811, almost exclusively and word-for-word from the chronicle by [[John Skylitzes]].&lt;ref name=jhj&gt;Howard-Johnston 2012, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

One late manuscript of ''Synopsis historion'' preserves a poem (anonymous but thought to be by Kedrenos) that derives his family name from the place where he was born, a small village of Cedrus (or Cedrea) in the [[Anatolic Theme]].&lt;ref name=treadgold&gt;Treadgold 2013, pp. 339–342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deboor&gt;de Boor 1905, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; The poem also identifies him as a [[proedros|proedrus]], a senior court official.&lt;ref name=treadgold /&gt;&lt;ref name=deboor /&gt;

Before becoming a proedros, Kedrenos may have held the somewhat lower rank of [[vestarches]].&lt;ref name=treadgold /&gt; Vestarches Georgios Kedrenos is in fact known from a number of 11th{{endash}}12th-century [[seal (emblem)|seals]] found mostly in the [[Danube]] region, but also in [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name=jhj /&gt;&lt;ref name=pbw&gt;[http://db.pbw.kcl.ac.uk/pbw2011/entity/person/152932 Georgios 20202] + [http://db.pbw.kcl.ac.uk/pbw2011/entity/boulloterion/4024 Boulloterion 4024], in [[Prosopography of the Byzantine World]] (consulted 27 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chiriac 2013, pp. 161–162 text + p. 167 images&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stepanova 2003, p. 127 text + image&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, several roughly contemporary seals refer to another court official, a certain "John Cedrenus, [[kouropalates|protocuropalates]] and [[dux|duke]]" who may have been a relative, perhaps, a brother or a cousin.&lt;ref name=treadgold /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.pbw.kcl.ac.uk/pbw2011/entity/person/159676 Ioannes 20693] + [http://db.pbw.kcl.ac.uk/pbw2011/entity/boulloterion/5397 Boulloterion 5397] + [http://db.pbw.kcl.ac.uk/pbw2011/entity/boulloterion/5398 Boulloterion 5398], in [[Prosopography of the Byzantine World]] (consulted 27 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Henrymayhew.png|thumb|Henry Mayhew, from ''London Labour and the London Poor'' (1861)]]

'''Henry Mayhew''' (25 November 1812 – 25 July 1887) was an English social researcher, journalist, playwright and advocate of reform. He was one of the co-founders of the satirical and humorous magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1841, and was the magazine's joint-editor, with [[Mark Lemon]], in its early days. He is also known for his work as a social researcher, publishing an extensive series of newspaper articles in the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' that was later compiled into the book series ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'' (1851), a groundbreaking and influential survey of the city's poor.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born in London, one of seventeen children of Joshua Mayhew. He was educated at [[Westminster School]] before running away from his studies to sea.&lt;ref&gt;Taithe (1996), p.3&lt;/ref&gt; He then served with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] as a [[midshipman]] on a ship bound for [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. He returned after several years, in 1829, becoming a trainee lawyer in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name = "puuvpx"&gt;Taithe (1996), p.9&lt;/ref&gt; He left this and became a freelance journalist. He contributed to ''The Thief'', a readers' digest, followed quickly by editing a weekly journal&amp;nbsp;– ''Figaro in London''. Mayhew reputedly fled his creditors and holed up at The Erwood Inn, a small public house in the village of [[Erwood]], south of [[Builth Wells]] in Wales.

===Paris and writing===
In 1835 Mayhew found himself in a state of debt and, along with a fellow writer, escaped to Paris to avoid his creditors.&lt;ref name = "puuvpx"/&gt; He spent his time writing and in the company of other writers including [[William Thackeray]] and [[Douglas Jerrold]]. Mayhew spent over ten years in Paris returning to England in the 1850s whereby he was involved in several literary adventures, mostly the writing of plays. Two of his plays&amp;nbsp;– ''But, However'' and the ''Wandering Minstrel''&amp;nbsp;– were successful, whilst his early work ''Figaro in London'' was less successful.&lt;ref name = "gxjpjs"&gt;Taithe (1996), p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Punch'' magazine===
[[Image:Punch.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Punch (magazine)|Punch magazine]] was co founded by Mayhew in 1841.]]
On 17 July 1841 Mayhew cofounded [[Punch (magazine)|Punch magazine]]. At its founding the magazine was jointly edited by Mayhew and [[Mark Lemon]]. The two men hired a group of writers and also illustrators to aid them. These included Douglas Jerrold, Angus Reach, John Leech, Richard Doyle and Shirley Brooks. Initially it was subtitled ''The London Charivari'', this being a reference to a satirical humour magazine published in France under the title ''[[Le Charivari]]'' (a work read often whilst Mayhew was in Paris).  Reflecting their satiric and humorous intent, the two editors took for their name and masthead the anarchic glove [[puppet]] [[Punch and Judy|Mr. Punch]].

''Punch'' was an unexpected success, selling about 6,000 copies a week in the early years. However, sales of as many as 10,000 issues a week were required to cover all costs of the magazine. In December 1842, the magazine was sold to Bradbury and Evans; Mayhew resigned as joint editor,&lt;ref name = "gxjpjs"/&gt; and he continued at the magazine as "suggestor in chief" with Mark Lemon reappointed as editor. Mayhew eventually severed his connection with the magazine, writing his last article in February 1845. His brother Horace stayed on the board of Punch until his own death.

The ''Punch'' years gave Mayhew the opportunity to meet talented illustrators who he later employed to work from [[daguerreotypes]] on ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]''.&lt;ref name = "gxjpjs"/&gt; Following ''Punch'' magazine, Mayhew new launched ''Iron Times'', a railway magazine. However this venture lost Mayhew so much money that he was forced to appear in a Court of [[Bankruptcy]] in 1846.

===Formative work===
In 1842 Mayhew contributed to the pioneering [[Illustrated London News]]. By this time Mayhew had become reasonably secure financially, had settled his debts and married Jane Jerrold, the daughter of his friend [[Douglas Jerrold]].&lt;ref&gt;Taithe (1996), p.11&lt;/ref&gt; She lived until 1880.

====''London Labour and the London Poor''====
{{Main|London Labour and the London Poor}}
The articles comprising ''London Labour and the London Poor'' were initially collected into three volumes in 1851; the 1861 edition included a fourth volume, co-written with Bracebridge Hemyng, John Binny and [[Andrew Halliday (journalist)|Andrew Halliday]], on the lives of prostitutes, thieves and beggars. This Extra Volume took a more general and statistical approach to its subject than Volumes 1 to 3.

Mayhew wrote in volume one: "''I shall consider the whole of the metropolitan poor under three separate phases, according as they ''will'' work, they ''can't'' work, and they ''won't'' work''".&lt;ref&gt;http://nils.lib.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A4000.01.0140  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050322222303/http://nils.lib.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A4000.01.0140 |date=22 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He interviewed everyone—beggars, street-entertainers (such as [[Punch and Judy]] men), market traders, prostitutes, labourers, [[sweatshop]] workers, even down to the "[[mudlark]]s" who searched the stinking mud on the banks of the [[River Thames]] for wood, metal, rope and coal from passing ships, and the "pure-finders" who gathered dog faeces to sell to [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]]s. He described their clothes, how and where they lived, their entertainments and customs, and made detailed estimates of the numbers and incomes of those practising each trade. The books show how marginal and precarious many people's lives were, in what, at that time, was the richest city in the world.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Mayhew's richly detailed descriptions give an impression of what the street markets of his day were like. An example from Volume 1:
:'The pavement and the road are crowded with purchasers and street-sellers. The housewife in her thick shawl, with the market-basket on her arm, walks slowly on, stopping now to look at the stall of caps, and now to cheapen a bunch of greens. Little boys, holding three or four onions in their hand, creep between the people, wriggling their way through every interstice, and asking for custom in whining tones, as if seeking charity. Then the tumult of the thousand different cries of the eager dealers, all shouting at the top of their voices, at one and the same time, is almost bewildering. "So-old again," roars one. "Chestnuts all'ot, a penny a score," bawls another. "An 'aypenny a skin, blacking," squeaks a boy. "Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy-- bu-u-uy!" cries the butcher. "[[Paper quire#Quire|Half-quire]] of paper for a penny," bellows the street stationer. "An 'aypenny a lot ing-uns." “Twopence a pound grapes." “Three a penny Yarmouth bloaters." “Who'll buy a bonnet for fourpence?" “Pick 'em out cheap here! three pair for a halfpenny, bootlaces." “Now's your time! beautiful whelks, a penny a lot." “Here's ha'p‘orths," shouts the perambulating confectioner. "Come and look at 'em! here's toasters!" bellows one with a Yarmouth bloater stuck on a toasting-fork. "Penny a lot, fine russets," calls the apple woman: and so the Babel goes on.'&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Henry 1851–1861. ''London Labour and the London Poor''. Researched and written, variously, with J. Binny, B. Hemyng and A. Halliday.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the poor reacted to ''London Labour and the London Poor''==
Some of the London street traders did not like the way Mayhew wrote about them. In spring/summer 1851 they established a ''Street Trader's Protection Association'' to guard themselves against the journalist.&lt;ref&gt;Münch (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Mayhew was the grandfather of Audrey Mayhew Allen (b. 1870), an author of a number of children's stories published in various periodicals, and of ''[[Gladys in Grammarland]]'', an [[Works based on Alice in Wonderland|imitation]] of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''Wonderland'' books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jerrold|first1=Yvonne|title=Family Tree|url=http://www.yvonnejerrold.com/FamilyTree/1-JaneMatilda%282%29Jerrold-Mayhews.html|website=Yvonne Jerrold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Mayhew's work was embraced by and was an influence on the [[Christian Socialists]], such as [[Thomas Hughes]], [[Charles Kingsley]], and [[F. D. Maurice]]. Radicals also published sizeable excerpts from the reports in the [[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]], the [[Red Republican]], and other newspapers. The often sympathetic investigations, with their immediacy and unswerving eye for detail, offered unprecedented insights into the condition of the Victorian poor. Alongside the earlier work of [[Edwin Chadwick]], they are also regarded as a decisive influence on the thinking of [[Charles Dickens]].

Mayhew's work inspired the script of director [[Christine Edzard]]'s 1990 film ''[[The Fool (1990 film)|The Fool]]''. Mayhew has appeared as a character in television and radio histories of Victorian London ; he was played by [[Timothy West]] in the documentary ''[[London (TV series)|London]]'' (2004), and [[David Haig]] in the [[Afternoon Play]] ''A Chaos of Wealth and Want'' (2010). In the 2012 novel ''[[Dodger (novel)|Dodger]]'' by [[Terry Pratchett]], Mayhew and his wife appear as fictionalised versions of themselves, and he is mentioned in the dedication.

'''Sir Henry Stuart Jones''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (15 May 1867 – 29 June 1939) was a British academic and fellow of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]], [[University of Oxford]], where he held an appointment from 1920 to 1927 as [[Camden Professor of Ancient History]]. Originally, Stuart was his second forename, but he and his wife generally prefixed it to their surname, and he was knighted in 1933 under the name Stuart-Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

He attended the [[British School at Athens]] and later served as director of the [[British School at Rome]].

Stuart Jones began in 1911 the revision of ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'', the standard dictionary of ancient [[Greek language|Greek]], with the assistance of [[Roderick McKenzie]].  A preliminary edition was published under the supervision of Stuart Jones and McKenzie in 1925, but the completed revision was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1940 only after both men's deaths. In a preface to the revision, the Press described Stuart Jones in these terms:

:Sir Henry was the ideal Editor; his wide range of knowledge and his exact scholarship, his persistent devotion to his task even in periods of ill health, his tactful assiduity in consulting experts and his skill in co-ordinating their results, gave the work at once its consistency and its elasticity.

Stuart Jones began his relationship with [[Wales]] when, in 1927, he became a candidate for the principalship of the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth|University College of Wales at Aberystwyth]]. His tenure in Wales would prove to be an enthusiastic one: during his time there, he learned the [[Welsh language]] and served on the committees of a number of Welsh institutions, including the council of [[St David's College, Lampeter]], as well as [[Trinity College, Carmarthen]], and the [[National Library of Wales]]. He also served as vice-chancellor of the federal [[University of Wales]] in 1929 and 1930. He was also elected (in 1928) to a Welsh Supernumerary Fellowship of [[Jesus College, Oxford]] in his capacity as Principal of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Times]]|title=University News &amp;ndash; New Supernumerary Fellow of Jesus College |date=3 March 1928|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historical method''' comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other [[evidence]], including the evidence of [[archaeology]], to research and then to write [[history|histories]] in the form of accounts of the past. The question of the nature, and even the possibility, of a sound historical method is raised in the [[philosophy of history]] as a question of [[epistemology]]. The study of historical method and of different ways of writing history is known as [[historiography]].

== Source criticism ==
{{main|Source criticism}}

Source criticism (or information evaluation) is the process of evaluating the qualities of an [[information source]], such as its validity, reliability, and relevance to the subject under investigation.

Gilbert J Garraghan divides source criticism into six inquiries:&lt;ref&gt; Gilbert J. Garraghan and Jean Delanglez ''A Guide to Historical Method'' p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''When'' was the source, written or unwritten, produced (date)?
# ''Where'' was it produced (localization)?
# ''By whom'' was it produced (authorship)?
# ''From what pre-existing material'' was it produced (analysis)?
# ''In what original form'' was it produced (integrity)?
# ''What is the evidential value'' of its contents (credibility)?

The first four are known as [[higher criticism]]; the fifth, [[lower criticism]]; and, together, external criticism.  The sixth and final inquiry about a source is called internal criticism. Together, this inquiry is known as [[source criticism]].

R. J. Shafer on external criticism: "It sometimes is said that its function is negative, merely saving us from using false evidence; whereas internal criticism has the positive function of telling us how to use authenticated evidence."&lt;ref&gt;''A Guide to Historical Method'', p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting that few documents are accepted as completely reliable, [[Louis R. Gottschalk|Louis Gottschalk]] sets down the general rule, "for each particular of a document the process of establishing credibility should be separately undertaken regardless of the general credibility of the author."  An author's trustworthiness in the main may establish a background probability for the consideration of each statement, but each piece of evidence extracted must be weighed individually.

=== Procedures for contradictory sources ===
[[Ernst Bernheim|Bernheim]] (1889) and Langlois &amp; Seignobos (1898) proposed a seven-step procedure for source criticism in history:&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Martha &amp; Prevenier, Walter(2001). From Reliable Sources: An Introduction to Historical Methods. Ithaca: Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|0-8014-8560-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

# If the sources all agree about an event, [[historians]] can consider the event proved.
# However, majority does not rule; even if most sources relate events in one way, that version will not prevail unless it passes the test of critical [[textual analysis]].
# The source whose account can be confirmed by reference to outside authorities in some of its parts can be trusted in its entirety if it is impossible similarly to confirm the entire text.
# When two sources disagree on a particular point, the historian will prefer the source with most "authority"—that is the source created by the expert or by the eyewitness.
# Eyewitnesses are, in general, to be preferred especially in circumstances where the ordinary observer could have accurately reported what transpired and, more specifically, when they deal with facts known by most contemporaries.
# If two independently created sources agree on a matter, the reliability of each is measurably enhanced.
# When two sources disagree and there is no other means of evaluation, then historians take the source which seems to accord best with common sense.

Subsequent descriptions of historical method, outlined below, have attempted to overcome the credulity built into the first step formulated by the nineteenth century historiographers by stating principles not merely by which different reports can be harmonized but instead by which a statement found in a source may be considered to be unreliable or reliable as it stands on its own.

=== Core principles for determining reliability ===
The following core principles of [[source criticism]] were formulated by two [[Scandinavia]]n historians, Olden-Jørgensen (1998) and Thurén (1997):&lt;ref&gt;Thurén, Torsten. (1997). Källkritik. Stockholm: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Human sources may be [[physical evidence|relics]] such as a [[fingerprint]]; or [[primary source|narratives]] such as a statement or a letter. Relics are more credible sources than narratives.
* Any given source may be forged or corrupted. Strong indications of the originality of the source increase its reliability.
* The closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate historical description of what actually happened.
* An [[witness|eyewitness]] is more reliable than [[hearsay|testimony at second hand]], which is more reliable than [[oral tradition|hearsay at further remove]], and so on.
*  If a number of ''independent'' sources contain the same message, the credibility of the message is strongly increased.
* The tendency of a source is its motivation for providing some kind of [[bias]]. Tendencies should be minimized or supplemented with opposite motivations.
*  If it can be demonstrated that the witness or source has no direct interest in creating bias then the credibility of the message is increased.

=== Eyewitness evidence ===
R. J. Shafer offers this checklist for evaluating [[eyewitness testimony]]:&lt;ref&gt;''A Guide to Historical Method'', pp. 157&amp;ndash;158&lt;/ref&gt;

# Is the real meaning of the statement different from its literal meaning?  Are words used in senses not employed today?  Is the statement meant to be ironic (i.e., mean other than it says)?
#  How well could the author ''observe'' the thing he reports?  Were his senses equal to the observation?  Was his physical location suitable to sight, hearing, touch?  Did he have the proper social ability to observe: did he understand the language, have other expertise required (e.g., [[law]], [[military]]); was he not being intimidated by his wife or the [[secret police]]?
# ''How'' did the author report?, and what was his ''ability'' to do so?
## Regarding his ''ability'' to report, was he biased?  Did he have proper time for reporting?  Proper place for reporting?  Adequate recording instruments?
## ''When'' did he report in relation to his observation?  Soon?  Much later?  Fifty years is much later as most eyewitnesses are dead and those who remain may have forgotten relevant material.
## What was the author's ''intention'' in reporting?  For ''whom'' did he report?  Would that audience be likely to require or suggest distortion to the author?
##  Are there additional clues to intended veracity?  Was he indifferent on the subject reported, thus probably not intending distortion?  Did he make statements damaging to himself, thus probably not seeking to distort?  Did he give incidental or casual information, almost certainly not intended to mislead?
#  Do his statements seem inherently improbable: e.g., contrary to [[human nature]], or in conflict with what we know?
#  Remember that some types of information are easier to observe and report on than others.
#  Are there inner contradictions in the document?

[[Louis R. Gottschalk|Louis Gottschalk]] adds an additional consideration: "Even when the fact in question may not be well-known, certain kinds of statements are ''both incidental and probable'' to such a degree that error or falsehood seems unlikely.  If an ancient inscription on a [[Roman roads|road]] tells us that a certain [[proconsul]] built that road while Augustus was [[princeps]], it may be doubted without further corroboration that that proconsul really built the road, but would be harder to doubt that the road was built during the principate of Augustus.  If an advertisement informs readers that 'A and B Coffee may be bought at any reliable grocer's at the unusual price of fifty cents a pound,' all the inferences of the advertisement may well be doubted without corroboration except that there is a brand of coffee on the market called 'A and B Coffee.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding History'', p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirect witnesses ===
Garraghan says that most information comes from "[[hearsay|indirect witnesses]]," people who were not present on the scene but heard of the events from someone else.&lt;ref&gt;''A Guide to Historical Method'', p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Louis R. Gottschalk|Gottschalk]] says that a historian may sometimes use hearsay evidence when no primary texts are available.  He writes, "In cases where he uses secondary witnesses...he asks: (1) On whose primary testimony does the secondary witness base his statements?  (2) Did the secondary witness accurately report the primary testimony as a whole?  (3) If not, in what details did he accurately report the primary testimony?  Satisfactory answers to the second and third questions may provide the historian with the whole or the gist of the primary testimony upon which the secondary witness may be his only means of knowledge.  In such cases the secondary source is the historian's 'original' source, in the sense of being the 'origin' of his knowledge.  Insofar as this 'original' source is an accurate report of primary testimony, he tests its credibility as he would that of the primary testimony itself." Gottschalk adds, "Thus hearsay evidence would not be discarded by the historian, as it would be by a law court merely because it is hearsay."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding History'', 165-66&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oral tradition ===
Gilbert Garraghan maintains that oral tradition may be accepted if it satisfies either two "broad conditions" or six "particular conditions", as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''A Guide to Historical Method'', 261&amp;ndash;262)&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Broad conditions stated''.
## The tradition should be supported by an unbroken series of witnesses, reaching from the immediate and first reporter of the fact to the living mediate witness from whom we take it up, or to the one who was the first to commit it to writing.
## There should be several parallel and independent series of witnesses testifying to the fact in question.
# ''Particular conditions formulated''.
## The tradition must report a public event of importance, such as would necessarily be known directly to a great number of persons.
## The tradition must have been generally believed, at least for a definite period of time.
## During that definite period it must have gone without protest, even from persons interested in denying it.
## The tradition must be one of relatively limited duration.  [Elsewhere, Garraghan suggests a maximum limit of 150 years, at least in cultures that excel in oral remembrance.]
## The critical spirit must have been sufficiently developed while the tradition lasted, and the necessary means of critical investigation must have been at hand.
## Critical-minded persons who would surely have challenged the tradition&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; had they considered it false&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; must have made no such challenge.

Other methods of verifying oral tradition may exist, such as comparison with the evidence of archaeological remains.

More recent evidence concerning the potential reliability or unreliability of oral tradition has come out of fieldwork in [[West Africa]] and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;See J. Vansina, ''De la tradition orale. Essai de méthode historique'', in translation as ''[[Oral Tradition as History]]'', as well as [[A. B. Lord]]'s study of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] bards in ''The Singer of Tales''.  Note also the [[Icelandic sagas]], such as that by [[Snorri Sturlason]] in the 13th century, and [[K. E. Bailey]], "Informed Controlled Oral Tradition and the Synoptic Gospels", ''[[Asia Journal of Theology]]'' [1991], 34&amp;ndash;54.  Compare Walter J. Ong, ''Orality and Literacy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anonymous sources ===

Historians do allow for the use of anonymous texts to establish historical facts.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk,''A Guide to Historical Method'', 169)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis: historical reasoning ==
Once individual pieces of information have been assessed in context, hypotheses can be formed and established by historical reasoning.

=== Argument to the best explanation ===
C. Behan McCullagh lays down seven conditions for a successful argument to the best explanation:&lt;ref&gt;''Justifying Historical Descriptions'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

#The statement, together with other statements already held to be true, must imply yet other statements describing present, observable data.  (We will henceforth call the first statement 'the [[hypothesis]]', and the statements describing observable data, 'observation statements'.)
#The hypothesis must be of ''greater explanatory scope'' than any other incompatible hypothesis about the same subject; that is, it must imply a greater variety of observation statements.
#The hypothesis must be ''of greater explanatory power'' than any other incompatible hypothesis about the same subject; that is, it must make the observation statements it implies more probable than any other.
#The hypothesis must be ''more plausible'' than any other incompatible hypothesis about the same subject; that is, it must be implied to some degree by a greater variety of accepted truths than any other, and be implied more strongly than any other; and its probable negation must be implied by fewer beliefs, and implied less strongly than any other.
#The hypothesis must be ''less ad hoc'' than any other incompatible hypothesis about the same subject; that is, it must include fewer new suppositions about the past which are not already implied to some extent by existing beliefs.
#It must be ''disconfirmed by fewer accepted beliefs'' than any other incompatible hypothesis about the same subject; that is, when conjoined with accepted truths it must imply fewer observation statements and other statements which are believed to be false.
#It must exceed other incompatible hypotheses about the same subject by so much, in characteristics 2 to 6, that there is little chance of an incompatible hypothesis, after further investigation, soon exceeding it in these respects.

McCullagh sums up, "if the scope and strength of an explanation are very great, so that it explains a large number and variety of facts, many more than any competing explanation, then it is likely to be true."&lt;ref&gt;''Justifying Historical Descriptions'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistical inference ===
McCullagh states this form of argument as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Justifying Historical Descriptions'', 48&lt;/ref&gt;

#There is probability (of the degree ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) that whatever is an A is a B.
#It is probable (to the degree ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that this is an A.
#Therefore, (relative to these premises) it is probable (to the degree ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that this is a B.

McCullagh gives this example:&lt;ref&gt;''Justifying Historical Descriptions'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

#In thousands of cases, the letters V.S.L.M. appearing at the end of a Latin inscription on a tombstone stand for ''Votum Solvit Libens Merito''.
#From all appearances the letters V.S.L.M. are on this tombstone at the end of a Latin inscription.
#Therefore, these letters on this tombstone stand for '’[[List of classical abbreviations#V|Votum Solvit Libens Merito]]’’.

This is a [[syllogism]] in probabilistic form, making use of a generalization formed by [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from numerous examples (as the first premise).

=== Argument from analogy ===
The structure of the argument is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Justifying Historical Descriptions'',&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;v85&lt;/ref&gt;

#One thing (object, event, or [[State of affairs (sociology)|state of affairs]]) has properties ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;.
#Another thing has properties ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
#So the latter has property ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;.

McCullagh says that an argument from analogy, if sound, is either a "covert statistical syllogism" or better expressed as an argument to the best explanation.  It is a statistical syllogism when it is "established by a sufficient number and variety of instances of the generalization"; otherwise, the argument may be invalid because properties 1 through n are unrelated to property ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, unless property ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is the best explanation of properties 1 through&amp;nbsp;''n''. Analogy, therefore, is uncontroversial only when used to suggest hypotheses, not as a conclusive argument.

'''James Lynn Kepner, Jr.''' (1923{{snd}}15 November 1997) was a journalist, author, historian, archivist and leader in the gay rights movement. His work was intertwined with [[One, Inc.]] and ''One Magazine'', and eventually contributed to the formation of the [[ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives]].

==Early life==
Jim Kepner was found wrapped in newspaper under an oleander bush in [[Galveston, Texas]] in September 1923, aged about eight months.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=David W.|title=Jim Kepner, in 70's, Is Dead; Historian of Gay Rights Effort|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/20/us/jim-kepner-in-70-s-is-dead-historian-of-gay-rights-effort.html|accessdate=January 31, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Timeline of Homosexual History: 1960 and before |publisher=The Tangent Group, HIC Publications |year=2004 |url=http://www.tangentgroup.org/history/Timeline/Timeline1959.html |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728082202/http://www.tangentgroup.org/history/Timeline/Timeline1959.html |archivedate=28 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He didn't find out he was adopted until he was nineteen. In 1942, followed his adopted father to San Francisco, where, wandering around the libraries of the city, Kepner could not find anything objective that focused on the way he was.  Later, he would record that he had been "aware of being different from age four."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Murray |first=Stephen O. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Kepner, Jim |work=glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture |publisher=glbtq, inc. |year=2003 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/kepner_j.html |doi= |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525001328/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/kepner_j.html |archivedate=25 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kepner started his career as a clerk for a railroad company in [[San Francisco, California]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="latimesobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oliver|first1=Myrna|title=Jim Kepner; Pioneer Activist Founded Gay Archives in 1942|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/18/news/mn-55007|accessdate=January 31, 2017|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=November 18, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Communist Party USA]] and wrote for a Communist newspaper in New York City, the ''[[Daily Worker]]''.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimesobit"/&gt; However, he was expelled from the party because of his homosexuality.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimesobit"/&gt; Instead, he joined the [[Mattachine Society]] in Los Angeles, the main gay organization in the United States at the time.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt;

Kepner's search for information and then [[LGBT community|community]] and [[LGBT culture|culture]] led him to begin a private collection of gay-related materials unlike anything previously compiled. Upon settling in Los Angeles in the early 1950s, Kepner became an essential part of the emergence of modern gay culture through journalism, writing, activism and pioneering archival work. He became one of the main writers for ''ONE Magazine''.&lt;ref name="latimesobit"/&gt; Before falling out with ''ONE'' in 1961, Kepner wrote many of the magazines' articles and served as co-editor of the magazine. ''ONE Magazine's'' documents and Kepner's research materials formed the beginning of today's ONE Archives. He maintained a relationship with ONE throughout his life even as he transferred his collections to his repeatedly renamed archives (Western Gay Archives and then the National Gay Archives and later the International Gay and Lesbian Archives).&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt;

Subjects of Kepner's 1950s writings included whether there was such a thing as a "gay community," police actions against the gay community, same-sex marriage, social interaction in the gay community and a whole host of other subjects. As he wrote, he collected, and over five more decades, Kepner was able to amass enormous amounts of essential information on gay life in the United States.&lt;ref name="latimesobit"/&gt; As HIV/AIDS ravaged thousands in the 1980s and 1990s, Kepner's efforts became essential as he recorded, memorialized, and documented the vital personal and community response to the epidemic. In a review of Kepner's 1998 book, ''Rough News, Daring Views: 1950s' Pioneer Gay Press Journalism'', historian [[William Armstrong Percy III]] wrote, "the Gay rights movement had three remarkable pioneers. Two—[[Harry Hay]] and [[Dorr Legg]]—have long been recognized, whereas the contribution of the third—Jim Kepner—has never been adequately documented…" Percy goes on to say "Kepner's articles (in the book) record not only the past of the gay rights movement but also its soul."

Kepner's collection consists of thousands of distinct subject files containing primary and secondary materials such as organizational minutes, newspaper clippings, journal and magazine articles, correspondence, brochures, and other printed and original materials relating to all aspects of the LGBT experience. ONE's Library and Kepner's archives merged in the early 1990s. By the time of Kepner's death, the ONE Archives had evolved into the premier source for gay and lesbian research in the nation.

==Death==
Kepner died on November 15, 1997 at the Midway Hospital in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimesobit"/&gt; He was 74.&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimesobit"/&gt;

He was a [[University]] professor of general history from  2000, and part of The [[Academy of Finland]]'s Centre of Excellence program upon Philosophical Psychology, Morality and Politics, serving as the Deputy Director of the Centre of Excellence from 2008. In the years 2004–2009, he was the Director of [[Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies]].
[[File:Juha Sihvola.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Juha Sihvola in 2009.]]

== Academic career ==
Sihvola defended his [[filosofian tohtori]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy]]) at the [[University of Helsinki]] on [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[ethics]] and [[cultural philosophy]], a work entitled, ''Decay, Progress, the Good Life? Hesiod and Protagoras on the Development of Culture''. His supervisors were [[Simo Knuuttila]], [[Holger Thesleff]], [[Matti Viikari]] and [[Päivi Setälä]]. Sihvola worked as an [[Academy of Finland]] research assistant (1983–1988), junior researcher (1988–1994), and senior researcher (1995–2000). He also conducted research in Italy and the United States, where he was a visiting researcher at  [[Brown University]](1991–1992), as well as being a junior researcher at the [[Center for Hellenic Studies]] in Washington DC (1994–1995). Sihvola taught at the University of Jyväskylä and, amongst other things, at the University of Helsinki's history, philosophy and [[systematic theology]] departments.
[[File:Sihvola Juha 11102004.jpg|left|thumb|160px|Juha Sihvola at the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 2004]]
Sihvola worked, amongst other things, as the editor of [[Historiallinen Aikakauskirja]] (Historical Periodical) (2001–2005), a member of the [[Academy of Finland]]'s Research Council for Culture and Society (2001–2006), as well as being a member of the board of [[Suomen Rooman Instituutin Säätiö]] (Foundation of the Finnish Historical Institute in Rome) (from 2004), serving as their chairperson from 2007.

Sihvola's studies deal with, above all, [[Ancient Philosophy]]'s history and the effects upon subsequent philosophical thinking. Sihvola also applied creatively [[Aristotle]]an and [[stoicism|Stoic philosophical]] ideas to current political and social debate. He discussed the investigation, among other things, of the good life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Filpus|first=Leena|title=Juha Sihvola: Globaalisaatio ei ole pelkkä rautahäkki|url=http://www.polemiikki.fi/lehdet/2000/numero-3/juha-sihvola-globaalisaatio.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028005804/http://www.polemiikki.fi/lehdet/2000/numero-3/juha-sihvola-globaalisaatio.aspx|archivedate=2007-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ethics of global affairs, the ethics of foreign policy, [[gender]], and the [[philosophy of religion]]. He wrote numerous speeches and articles in daily newspapers, in particular, the [[Helsingin Sanomat]], and appeared on radio and television current affairs programs.

Sihvola conducted research in collaboration with [[Simo Knuuttila]] and the American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]]. He worked on two Knuuttila-led Academy of Finland Centres of Excellence, '' History of Mind'' (2002–2007) and ''Philosophical Psychology, Morality and Politics'' (Deputy Director, 2008–2012). Together with Nussbaum, Sihvola organized numerous international philosophical conferences from 1991. Sihvola was also Director of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]-funded research project on ethics in foreign policy (2004–2005).

'''Maria Ley-Piscator''' (born '''Friederike Flora Czada''', 1 August 1898 – 14 October 1999) is best known as the wife of [[Erwin Piscator]] (1893-1966), Germany's famous left-wing [[theater director]]. Born on 1 August 1898 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now Austria), Maria Ley sought to create a theatrical career for herself as a [[dancer]] in [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]. Later, she turned to [[choreography]] and helped in several stage productions with [[Max Reinhardt]], including ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.

Maria Ley also studied literature at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where she met Erwin Piscator (her third husband) during his exile in 1936. After marrying in Paris, the couple moved to Manhattan in 1939, where they founded the [[Dramatic Workshop]] at the [[The New School|New School for Social Research]]. Their students included [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Tony Randall]]. Ley-Piscator directed several theatrical productions off Broadway.

During the 1970s she worked as a teacher at the [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] and at [[Stony Brook University]]. Ley-Piscator died in New York in 1999 at the age of 101.

'''Meike Hoffmann''' (born 1962) is a German [[Art history|art historian]] and [[Provenance|provenance researcher]].

==Life==
Hoffmann studied art history, archeology, cultural studies, and library science at the [[Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel]] and at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]] ([[Free University Berlin]]). In 2005, she was awarded a PhD for her dissertation on [[Die Brücke]] art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Meike: Leben und Schaffen der Künstlergruppe Brücke 1905 bis 1913. Mit einem kommentierten Werkverzeichnis der Geschäfts- und Ausstellungsgrafik, Berlin 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 1994, Meike Hoffmann was a research assistant at the Berlin gallery [[Svetlana Theis|Theis]] and the [[Keramik-Museum Berlin|Berlin Ceramics Museum]]. From 1992 to 1995, she taught Art History at the [[Goethe-Institut]] in Berlin, and from 1995 to 1999, she was a research trainee and curator at the [[Brücke Museum]] in Berlin. From 1999 to 2006, she worked as a freelance art historian, writer and [[curator]].

Since November 2006, Meike Hoffmann is in charge of the [http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/projekte/entartete_kunst/ Forschungsstelle "Entartete Kunst"] ([[Degenerate Art]] Research Center) at the Freie Universität Berlin. The Research Center was initiated in 2003 by the Ferdinand-Möller Stiftung, which secured the funding until 2016. Since then, the Research Center is funded by the Federal Government Commission for Culture and the Media.

In 2010, Hoffmann was involved in the identification of the missing sculptures found in the archaeological excavations at the [[Rotes Rathaus]] City Hall of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;(In German)Kostbare-Kunstwerke-am-Roten-Rathaus-entdeckt http://www.morgenpost.de/kultur/article1444928/Kostbare-Kunstwerke-am-Roten-Rathaus-entdeckt.html&lt;/ref&gt;
She designed the first worldwide academic training program in provernance research that she teaches continuously since 2011 at the Free University Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;(In German) Deutschlandfunk Kultur: Studium für die Suche nach dem Ursprung, 19.04.2011 http://www.dradio.de/dkultur/sendungen/thema/1439434&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ‘[[2012_Munich_artworks_discovery|Schwabinger Kunstfund]]’ (‘Schwabing Art Trove’) in 2012, Meike Hoffmann was commissioned to examine classic modern art within the collection of Hildebrand Gurlitt. She participated at the press conference about the Munich art discovery on 5 November 2013 in Augsburg&lt;ref&gt;(In German) Nazi-Schatz lagerte ungesichert in Gurlitts Wohnung, Focus vom 5. November 2013 http://www.focus.de/kultur/kunst/tid-34488/ticker-nachlese-zur-kunst-schatz-pk-cornelius-gurlitt-lagerte-den-milliardenschweren-nazi-schatz-ungesichert_aid_1148685.html&lt;/ref&gt; and became an official member of the Taskforce ‘Schwabinger Kunstfund’ as well as for the follow-up projects of the Deutsches Zentrum Kulturgutverluste (German Lost Art Foundation) and the Kunstmuseum Bern (Museum of fine Arts Berne).

On 1 March 2017, Meike Hoffmann took over the scientific coordination of the ‘Mosse Art Research Initiative’ (MARI) which is also located at the Freie Universität Berlin. The project is the first public-private partnership in provenance research executed by public German institutions in cooperation with descendants of the victims of National Socialist prosecution.&lt;ref&gt; Colin Moynihan: German Foundation to Help Jewish Heirs in Search for Nazi Looted Art.

'''Milan Djakov Milićević''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Милан Ђаков Милићевић; June 4, 1831 &amp;ndash; November 17, 1908) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] writer, biographer, publicist, ethnologist and one of the founders of the [[Association of Writers of Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanu.ac.rs/Clanstvo/IstClan.aspx?arg=338 Biography [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|SANU]] website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Milan Đakov Milićević was a Serbian geographical, ethnographical, and historical writer, and novelist; author of stories, studies, sketches of special Serbian interest. He left a most detailed account of his time.

==Biography==
He was born of a good and old Serbian family in [[Ripanj]], about 25 kilometers south of Belgrade at the foot of [[Avala]] mountain, on the fourth of June 1831. When Milićević was a teenager his parents moved to
[[Belgrade]]. Having received his early education at the gymnasium of Belgrade (1845), he entered the [[Belgrade Higher School|Grande école (''Velika škola'')]], and engaged in the study of religion and education. Although Milićević did specially distinguish himself as a student, ill health prevented him from going to [[Russia]] to pursue further studies. University life, however, had considerable influence in the development of his character and furnished him with much of his literary material. After taking a degree in 1850, he taught school in the Serbian heartland  [[Lesnik (Serbia)]], and in 1851 at [[Topola]]. In early 1852 Milićević took a clerical post at the courthouse in [[Valjevo]], and was soon transferred to a similar post in Belgrade before joining the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs in 1852. Three years later Milićević transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there he remained until 1861. From then until 1880 he served as secretary of the Ministry of Education. In 1884 the Minister of Education took him as his assistant, and in 1886 he became head librarian of the National Library of Belgrade. He entered the Skupština (Parliament) as a representative of a Belgrade constituency and as a member of the Progressive Party, led by Milutin Garašanin, son of [[Ilija Garašanin]], and [[Vladan Đorđević]]. From 1896 to 1899 he was the president of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], and in 1899 he retired. In 1901 he celebrated his 50th anniversary as a pedagogue and novelist.

He died at Belgrade in 1908.

==Work==
===Scholar===

Milićević was an indefatigable pedagogue and a prolific writer, so that he left behind him, as the fruit of his labours, a large number of books, novels, and monographs.

From 1868 to 1876 Milićević edited ''Škola'' (School), a tri-monthly scholastic journal. He was a voluminous writer on educational subjects, and was the author of various school-textbooks. He authored 100 books, including several novels, and published hundreds of studies, papers, monographs, and learned articles. Among his pedagological textbooks were:

''Schools in Serbia'' (1868); ''A Study Guide'' (1869); ''Pedagological Studies'' (1870); ''School Hygiene'' (1870); ''History of Pedagogy'' (1871); ''School Discipline'' (1871); ''Adolf Diesterweg'' (1871); ''Schools for the Rights of Citizens and Responsibilities'' (1873); etc.

When Milićević was appointed secretary of the Ministry of Education he immediately put into practice methods of the most celebrated reformers of education of the past and present, [[Dositej Obradović]] (Serbia), [[Teodor Janković-Mirijevski]] (Austria and Russia), [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (Switzerland), [[Friedrich Fröbel]] (Germany), [[Adolph Diesterweg]] (Germany), [[Ferdinand Buisson]] (France), and others. He translated the works of the great French writers, philosophers and educators of his time, ''Paris in America'' by [[Édouard Laboulaye]] (1863); ''Moral History of Women'' (1876) and ''Fathers and Children in the Nineteenth Century'' (Vols. 1 &amp; 2, 1872 and 1873) by [[Ernest Legouvé]]; ''Women of the 20th Century'' by [[Jules Simon]]; Émile by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and works by [[Montesquieu]] (''Persian Letters'') and [[Jules Sandeau]] (''Galebova stena''). Milićević translated Russian author [[Alexander Hilferding]]'s history of the Serbians and Bulgarians, ''Pisma o istoriji Srba i Bugara'', and [[Ignaty Potapenko]]'s 1892 short story ''Istinska sluzba'' (''True Vocation'').

He also began recruiting the best minds in academia. A well-known pedagogue, Dr. Vojislav Bakić (1847–1929), early in 1875 decided to move to Belgrade from Zagreb. He requested Milan Milićević to help him find a job in Serbia. Milićević noted in his diary January 8, 1875: "I am happy about it because our national education will acquire a hard-working,competent, educated and erudite scholar." Bakić, author of ''Srpsko rodoljublje i otačastvoljublje'', stressed freedom and equality even more than brotherhood. He advocated the education of girls to prepare for their patriotic mission.

===Historian and Ethnologist===

His first books dealt with the history, geography and customs of his people. In 1857 he published two books, ''The Serbian Peasant'' and ''Serbian Towns'' which attracted some attention. It was followed by a three more book entitled ''The Life of Serbian Peasants'' (Vol 1, 1868; Vol. 2, 1873; Vol 3, 1877).

In his early years Milićević acquired a love of national customs and traditions which his humanist education never obliterated, while, in addition, he learnt to know the whole range of our popular literature (''Narodne pesme'') -- legends, songs and fairy tales which were collected and published by [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]]. These circumstances explain the richness of his vocabulary, and joined to an ardent patriotism they fitted him to become a political leader and a leading scholar, proponent of the Vukovian School (Vukova škola). As a scholar, he gave fresh  impulse to Vuk Karadžić reforms in his early and later works. At the time, there were many historians who raised methodological questions. A step towards broader views and the application of modern European methodological principles was taken through the works of Milan Djakov Milićević, [[Jovan Skerlić]] and [[Jovan Cvijić]].

He has written:
 
* Lessons in Civil Rights and Responsibilities (1873)
* Principality of Serbia (1876)
* Serbian Peasant Life (in the glasnik: 1867 and 1875)
* Kingdom of Serbia (1884)
* The stories of Serbian life in the 19th century: ''"Jurmusa i Fatima"'' and "White Evenings" (1879)
* Biographies of Famous People in Present-day Serbia/''Pomenik znamenitih ljudi u srpskog naroda novijega doba'' (1888)
* Petar Jokić: Events and People in the First Serbian Uprising (1891)
* Prince Miloš and His Story (1891)
* Karadjordje (1903)

In the introduction of his ''Principality of Serbia'' (1876), Milićević concluded in didactic verse: "Knowledge is enlightenment, will is might, let us work, day and night."

From 1873 to his death his work was educational, with the exception of a short stint in politics before his retirement. As president of the Learned Society, Milićević enlarged the resources 
and number of the institution, which had hundreds of members by the turn of the century. In other fields, he promoted common school education (especially manual training), the
work of the public library, and took active part in discussion of women's rights, economics, statistical and other public questions, holding many offices of honour and responsibility. As 
an author he wrote on the government treatment of the poor, underprivileged, and general political economy besides producing monographs on the life of Petar Jokić, a buljukbasha of Karadjordje's guard who died in 1852, and the history of Serbia in his own time.

In 1878 the Serbian Learned Society (''Srpsko učeno društvo'') elected Slovak professor Janko Šafarik, Milan Djakov Milićević and Serbian painter Steva Todorović to collect ethnographic objects in Serbia for exhibit at the Pan-Slavic Congress in St. Peterburg. Milićević and Todorović selected 600 national costumes and Todorović supplied twenty photographs from Serbia. Officially, however, it was Milan Milićević who led the delegation, both as chief delegate of the Serbian Learned Society and by virtue of his fluency in the Russian language.

===Politics===
[[File:Stevan Todorović - Portrait of Milan Đ. Milićević, 1866.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Milićević by [[Stevan Todorović]], [[National Museum of Serbia]]]]

As a politician Milićević had an active career with the Progressive Party, led by Milutin Garašanin, son of [[Ilija Garašanin]], and [[Vladan Đorđević]]. The Progressive Party sprang from the group of young conservatives, imbued with Western liberalism. Their better known regional leaders were [[Milan Piroćanac]], [[Čedomilj Mijatović]], historian [[Stojan Novaković]], poet Milan Kujundžić-Aberdar, poet, novelist and dramatist [[Milorad Popović Šapčanin]], and Milan Đakov Milićević.

From 1896 he entered the Skupština (Serbian Parliament) as representative of a Belgrade constituency, representing the Progressive Party, but decided three years later to retire. Milićević believed that the solidarity of Slavic nations should recognize and not repudiate the principle of distinctive national differences while contributing to the mutual respect and understanding of all humankind. Professing advanced Liberal and democratic views, he often had to defend personal freedoms to those who were used to strong-arm tactics. "From many sides our friends complain how the Radicals are upsetting them," Milićević wrote in his diary, "They do not understand that this is a consequence of freedom and blame us that we do not use the state administration to stop them. No! That we will not do!....."

===Literary Work===

Literary critic [[Jovan Skerlić]] classed Milićević with [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubiša]] (1824–1878), an excellent Serbian short story writer originally from [[Montenegro]]. The two were famed as story tellers, like [[Joksim Nović-Otočanin]] and [[Jovan Sundečić]] a generation before.

In Milan Miličević's book ''Pomenik znamenitih ljudi u srpskog narodu novieg doba'' (Album of the important personalities among the Serbs in modern times), he claimed that [[Ilija Garašanin]]'s policy in office was guided by the ides presented in the ''[[Nacertanije]],'' even though the existence of such a document was at that time unknown only to a few and it remained unpublished until 1906.

The '''Nefertiti Bust''' is a painted [[stucco]]-coated [[limestone]] [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[Nefertiti]], the [[Great Royal Wife]] of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/nefertiti|title=Nefertiti - Ancient History - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is believed to have been crafted in 1345&amp;nbsp;B.C. by the sculptor [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]], because it was found in his workshop in [[Amarna]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egyptian-museum-berlin.com/c53.php|title=Nefertiti:  (Society for the Promotion of the Egyptian Museum Berlin)|last=e.V.|first=Verein zur Förderung des Ägyptischen Museums und Papyrussammlung Berlin|website=www.egyptian-museum-berlin.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most copied works of [[ancient Egypt]]. Owing to the work, Nefertiti has become one of the most famous women of the ancient world, and an icon of [[Feminine beauty ideal|feminine beauty]]. 

A German archaeological team led by [[Ludwig Borchardt]] discovered the bust in 1912 in Thutmose's workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2012/12/06/the-bust-of-nefertiti-remembering-ancient-egypts-famous-queen/|title=The Bust of Nefertiti: Remembering Ancient Egypt’s Famous Queen|last=Tharoor|first=Ishaan|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been kept at various locations in Germany since its discovery, including the cellar of a bank, a salt mine in [[Merkers-Kieselbach]], the [[Berlin State Museums#Dahlem|Dahlem museum]], the Egyptian Museum in [[Charlottenburg]] and the [[Altes Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2012/12/06/the-bust-of-nefertiti-remembering-ancient-egypts-famous-queen/|title=The Bust of Nefertiti: Remembering Ancient Egypt’s Famous Queen|last=Tharoor|first=Ishaan|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently on display at the [[Neues Museum]] in Berlin, where it was originally displayed before [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2012/12/06/the-bust-of-nefertiti-remembering-ancient-egypts-famous-queen/|title=The Bust of Nefertiti: Remembering Ancient Egypt’s Famous Queen|last=Tharoor|first=Ishaan|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nefertiti bust has become a cultural symbol of Berlin as well as ancient Egypt. Nefertiti herself has become an icon. Nefertiti is widely known for her beauty and versatility. It has also been the subject of an intense argument between Egypt and Germany over Egyptian demands for its repatriation. It was dragged into controversy by the ''Body of Nefertiti'' art exhibition and also by doubts over its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=awM8r8vu_fS8&amp;refer=home | work=Bloomberg | title=Nefertiti Bust May Be 100 Years Old, Not 3,000: Martin Gayford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Akhenaten, Nefertiti and their children.jpg|thumb|230px|A "house altar" (''c.''&amp;nbsp;1350&amp;nbsp;BC) depicting Akhenaten, Nefertiti and three of their daughters. Note Nefertiti wears a crown similar to that depicted on the bust.]]
Nefertiti (meaning "the beautiful one has come forth") was the 14th-century&amp;nbsp;BC [[Great Royal Wife]] (chief consort) of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]]. Akhenaten initiated a new monotheistic form of worship called [[Atenism]] dedicated to the Sun disc [[Aten]].&lt;ref name = "who"/&gt; Little is known about Nefertiti. Theories suggest she could have been an Egyptian royal by birth, a foreign princess or the daughter of a high government official named [[Ay]], who became pharaoh after [[Tutankhamun]]. She may have been the co-regent of Egypt with Akhenaten, who ruled from 1352&amp;nbsp;BC to 1336&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name = "who"/&gt; Nefertiti bore six daughters to Akhenaten, one of whom, [[Ankhesenamun|Ankhesenpaaten]] (renamed Ankhesenamun after the suppression of the Aten cult), married Tutankhamun, Nefertiti's stepson. Nefertiti was thought to have disappeared from history in the twelfth year of Akhenaten's reign, though whether this is due to her death or because she took a new name is not known. She may also have later become a pharaoh in her own right, ruling alone for a short time after her husband's death.&lt;ref name = "who"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nef"&gt;Silverman, Wegner, Wegner pp.130-33&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is now known that she was still alive in the sixteenth year of her husband's reign from a limestone quarry inscription found at Dayr Abū Ḥinnis.&lt;ref&gt;Athena van der Perre, The Year 16 graffito of Akhenaten in Dayr Abū Ḥinnis. A Contribution to the Study of the Later Years of Nefertiti, Journal of Egyptian History (JEH) 7 (2014), pp.67-108&lt;/ref&gt; Dayr Abū Ḥinnis is located "on the eastern side of the Nile, about ten kilometres north of [[Amarna]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2443316/ A. Van der Perre, 'Nefertiti's last documented reference for now' F. Seyfried (ed.), In the Light of Amarna. 100 Years of the Nefertiti Discovery, (Berlin, 2012), pp.195-197 (academia.edu)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bust of Nefertiti is believed to have been crafted about 1345&amp;nbsp;BC by the sculptor [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]].&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/nefertiti/history/history.html |title=Who Was Nefertiti? |last=Maryalice Yakutchik |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |accessdate=23 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105162450/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/nefertiti/history/history.html |archivedate=5 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo2"/&gt; The bust does not have any inscriptions, but can be certainly identified as Nefertiti by the characteristic crown, which she wears in other surviving (and clearly labelled) depictions, for example the 'house altar'.&lt;ref name="fordummes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Charlotte Booth|title=The Ancient Egyptians for Dummies|publisher=for Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RlFFcPa8pIUC&amp;pg=PT319&amp;dq=nefertiti#v=onepage&amp;q=nefertiti&amp;f=false | isbn=978-0-470-06544-0|date=2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery===
[[File:Nefertiti berlin.jpg|thumb|left|Nefertiti bust]]
The Nefertiti bust was found on 6 December 1912 at [[Amarna]] by the [[Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft|German Oriental Company]] (''Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft''&amp;nbsp;– DOG), led by German archaeologist [[Ludwig Borchardt]]. It was found in what had been the sculptor Thutmose's workshop, along with other unfinished busts of Nefertiti.&lt;ref name = "b285"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "s115"&gt;Siehr p.115&lt;/ref&gt; Borchardt's diary provides the main written account of the find; he remarks, "Suddenly we had in our hands the most alive Egyptian artwork. You cannot describe it with words. You must see it."&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt;

A 1924 document found in the archives of the German Oriental Company recalls the 20 January 1913 meeting between Ludwig Borchardt and a senior Egyptian official to discuss the division of the archeological finds of 1912 between Germany and Egypt. According to the secretary of the German Oriental Company (who was the author of the document and who was present at the meeting), Borchardt "wanted to save the bust for us".&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,606525,00.html|title=Archaeological Controversy: Did Germany Cheat to Get Bust of Nefertiti?|date=10 February 2009|publisher=Spiegel Online|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borchardt is suspected of having concealed the bust's real value,&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; although he denied doing so.&lt;ref name = "b288"&gt;Berger p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

While Philipp Vandenberg describes the coup as "adventurous and beyond comparison",&lt;ref name = "b286"&gt;Breger p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine lists it among the "Top 10 Plundered Artifacts".&lt;ref name = "TIME"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1883142_1883129_1883119,00.html|title=Top 10 Plundered Artifacts|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|accessdate=24 November 2009 | date=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borchardt showed the Egyptian official a photograph of the bust "that didn't show Nefertiti in her best light". The bust was wrapped up in a box when Egypt's chief antiques inspector [[Gustave Lefebvre]] came for inspection. The document reveals that Borchardt claimed the bust was made of [[gypsum]] to mislead the inspector. The German Oriental Company blames the negligence of the inspector and points out that the bust was at the top of the exchange list and says the deal was done fairly.&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "mons"/&gt;

==Description and examinations==
The bust of Nefertiti is {{convert|48|cm|in}} tall and weighs about {{convert|20|kg|lb}}. It is made of a [[limestone]] core covered with painted [[stucco]] layers. The face is completely symmetrical and almost intact, but the left eye lacks the inlay present in the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Horst Woldemar Janson |author2=Anthony F.

The background of the eye-socket is unadorned limestone. Nefertiti wears her characteristic blue crown known as the "Nefertiti cap crown" with a golden diadem band looped around like horizontal ribbons and joining at the back, and an [[Uraeus]] (cobra) over her brow&amp;nbsp;– which is now broken.

According to [[David P. Silverman|David Silverman]], the Nefertiti bust reflects the classical [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]] style, deviating from the "eccentricities" of the [[Amarna art]] style, which was developed in Akhenaten's reign. The exact function of the bust is unknown, though it is theorized that the bust may be a sculptor's [[modello]] to be used as a basis for other official portraits, kept in the artist's workshop.&lt;ref name="Ancient Egypt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=David P.|title=Ancient Egypt|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|year=1997|page=221|isbn=0-19-521952-X|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x7p_QMIjESwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA221&amp;dq=nefertiti+bust+amarna&amp;cd=15#v=onepage&amp;q=nefertiti%20bust%20amarna&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Colors===
[[Ludwig Borchardt]] commissioned a chemical analysis of the colored pigments of the head. The result of the examination was published in the book ''Portrait of Queen Nofretete'' in 1923:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudolph Anthes|title=Nofretete&amp;nbsp;– The Head of Queen Nofretete|publisher=Verlag Gebr|location=Mann, Berlin |year=1961|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blue: powdered [[frit]], colored with [[Copper(II) oxide|copper oxide]]
* Skin color (light red): fine powdered lime spar colored with red chalk ([[iron oxide]])
* Yellow: [[orpiment]] ([[arsenic trisulfide|arsenic sulfide]])
* Green: powdered frit, colored with [[copper]] and iron oxide
* Black: [[coal]] with wax as a binding medium
* White: [[chalk]]

===Missing left eye===
When the bust was first discovered, no piece of quartz to represent the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] of the left eyeball was present, as in the other eye, and none was found despite an intensive search and a then significant reward of £1000 being put up for information regarding its whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthias Schulz |year=2012 |title=Die entführte Königin (German) |journal=Der Spiegel |volume=49 |issue=3.12.2012 |pages=128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Borchardt assumed that the quartz iris of the left eye had fallen out when the sculptor Thutmose's workshop fell into ruin.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce A. Tyldesley, ''Nefertiti: Egypt's sun queen'', Viking, 1999, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; The missing eye led to speculation that Nefertiti may have suffered from an ophthalmic infection, and actually lost her left eye, though the presence of an iris in other statues of her contradicted this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Gladstone Bratton, ''A history of Egyptian archaeology'', Hale, 1968, p.223&lt;/ref&gt;

Dietrich Wildung proposed that the bust in Berlin was a model for official portraits and was used by the master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve the internal structure of the eye, and thus the left iris was not added.&lt;ref name="disc1"&gt;{{cite news | title = Scholar: Nefertiti Was an Aging Beauty | url = http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2006/09/05/nefertiti_arc.html | last = Lorenzi | first = R | date = 5 September 2006 | work = Discovery News | publisher = [[Discovery Channel]] | accessdate = 18 December 2009|pages = 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'' and Silverman presents a similar view that the bust was deliberately kept unfinished.&lt;ref name = "silver"&gt;Silverman, Wegner, Wegner pp. 21, 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "gard"/&gt; Hawass suggested that Thutmose had created the left eye, but it was later destroyed.&lt;ref name = "digital"/&gt;

===CT scans===
The bust was first [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]]ned in 1992, with the scan producing cross sections of the bust every {{convert|5|mm|in}}.&lt;ref name="dsc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;For comparative analysis between 1992 and 2006 CT scans: {{cite journal|author1=Bernhard Illerhaus |author2=Andreas Staude |author3=Dietmar Meinel |title=Nondestructive Insights into Composition of the Sculpture of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti with CT and the dependence of object surface from image processing|url=http://www.ndt.net/article/ndtnet/2009/illerhaus.pdf|publisher = NDT Database &amp; e-Journal of Nondestructive Testing|year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Dietrich Wildung, the director of Berlin's Egyptian Museum, while trying a different lighting at the [[Altes Museum]]—where the bust was then displayed—observed wrinkles on Nefertiti's neck and bags under her eyes, suggesting the sculptor had tried to depict signs of aging. A CT scan confirmed Wildung's findings; Thutmose had added gypsum under the cheeks and eyes in an attempt to perfect his sculpture, Wildung explained.&lt;ref name="disc1"/&gt;

The CT scan in 2006, led by Alexander Huppertz, the director of the Imaging Science Institute in Berlin, revealed a wrinkled face of Nefertiti carved in the inner core of the bust.&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt; The results were published in the April 2009 ''[[Radiology (journal)|Radiology]]'' journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander Huppertz  |first1=A |author2=Dietrich Wildung |author3=[[Barry J.

==Later history==
The bust of Nefertiti has become "one of the most admired, and most copied, images from ancient Egypt", and the star exhibit used to market Berlin's museums.&lt;ref name = "natgeo"/&gt; It is seen as an "icon of international beauty".&lt;ref name = "times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="disc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "bbc"/&gt; "Showing a woman with a long neck, elegantly arched brows, high cheekbones, a slender nose and an enigmatic smile played about red lips, the bust has established Nefertiti as one of the most beautiful faces of antiquity."&lt;ref name="disc1"/&gt; It is described as the most famous bust of ancient art, comparable only to the mask of [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref name = "Schultz"/&gt;

Nefertiti has become an icon of Berlin's culture.&lt;ref name = "b285"/&gt; Some 500,000 visitors see Nefertiti every year.&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL"/&gt; The bust is described as "the best-known work of art from ancient Egypt, arguably from all antiquity".&lt;ref&gt;Siehr p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Her face is on postcards of Berlin and 1989 German postage stamps.&lt;ref name = "bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6632021.stm|title=Row over Nefertiti bust continues |last=Moore |first=Tristana  |date= 7 May 2007|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b292"/&gt;

===Locations in Germany===
[[File:Neues Museum Berlin EP1.JPG|thumb|[[Neues Museum]], Berlin is the present location of the Nefertiti bust]]

The Nefertiti bust has been in Germany since 1913,&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; when it was shipped to Berlin and presented to [[Henri James Simon|James Simon]], a wholesale merchant and the sponsor of the Amarna excavation.&lt;ref name = "s115"/&gt; It was displayed at Simon's residence until 1913, when Simon loaned the bust and other artifacts from the Amarna dig to the Berlin Museum.&lt;ref name="chrono"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nofretete-geht-auf-reisen.de/echronol.htm|title= The Bust of Nefertiti: A Chronology|year=2007|work="Nefertiti travels" campaign website|publisher=CulturCooperation|accessdate=22 November 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318133459/http://www.nofretete-geht-auf-reisen.de/echronol.htm|archivedate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rest of the Amarna collection was displayed in 1913–14, Nefertiti was kept secret at Borchardt's request.&lt;ref name="b286" /&gt; In 1918, the Museum discussed the public display of the bust, but again kept it secret on the request of Borchardt.&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt; It was permanently donated to the Berlin Museum in 1920. Finally, in 1923, the bust was first unveiled to the public in Borchardt's writing and later in 1924, displayed to the public as part of the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="b286"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt; The bust created a sensation, swiftly becoming a world-renowned icon of feminine beauty, and one of the most universally-recognised artifacts to survive from Ancient Egypt.  The Nefertiti bust was displayed in Berlin’s [[Neues Museum]] on [[Museum Island]] until the museum was closed in 1939; with the onset of [[World War II]], the Berlin museums were emptied and the artifacts moved to secure shelters for safekeeping.&lt;ref name = "s115"/&gt; Nefertiti was initially stored in the cellar of the Prussian Governmental Bank and then, in the autumn of 1941, moved to the tower of a [[Flak tower|flak bunker]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt; The Neues Museum suffered bombings in 1943 by the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name = "inde"/&gt; On 6 March 1945, the bust was moved to a German salt mine at [[Merkers-Kieselbach]] in [[Thuringia]].&lt;ref name = "s115"/&gt;

In March 1945, the bust was found by the American Army and given over to its [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives branch]]. It was moved to the [[Reichsbank]] in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] and then, in August, shipped to the U.S. Central Collecting Point in [[Wiesbaden]] where it was displayed to the public in 1946.&lt;ref name = "s115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt; In 1956, the bust was returned to [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref name = "s115"/&gt; There it was displayed at the [[Berlin State Museums#Dahlem|Dahlem Museum]]. As early as 1946, [[East Germany]] (German Democratic Republic) insisted on the return of Nefertiti to Museum Island in [[East Berlin]], where the bust had been displayed before the war.&lt;ref name = "s115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt; In 1967, Nefertiti was moved in the Egyptian Museum in [[Charlottenburg]] and remained there until 2005, when it was moved  to the [[Altes Museum]].&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt; The bust returned to the Neues Museum as its centerpiece when the museum reopened in October 2009.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "inde"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/queen-nefertiti-rules-again-in-berlins-reborn-museum-1804370.html|title= Queen Nefertiti rules again in Berlin's reborn museum|last=Tony Paterson|date=17 October 2009|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=15 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://features.csmonitor.com/globalnews/2009/11/02/germany-time-for-egypts-nefertiti-bust-to-go-home/|title= Germany: Time for Egypt's Nefertiti bust to go home? |last=Isabelle de Pommereau|date=2 November 2009|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requests for repatriation to Egypt===
Ever since the official unveiling of the bust in Berlin in 1924, the Egyptian authorities have been demanding its return to Egypt.&lt;ref name = "b285"&gt;Breger p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "s116"&gt;Sieher p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Egypt threatened to ban German excavations in Egypt unless Nefertiti was returned. In 1929, Egypt offered to exchange other artifacts for Nefertiti, but Germany declined. In the 1950s, Egypt again tried to initiate negotiations but there was no response from Germany.&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "s116"/&gt; Although Germany had previously strongly opposed the repatriation, in 1933 [[Hermann Göring]] considered returning the bust to King [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk Fouad]] of Egypt as a political gesture. Hitler opposed the idea, and told the Egyptian government that he would build a new Egyptian museum for Nefertiti: "In the middle, this wonder, Nefertiti, will be  enthroned, ... I will never relinquish the  head of the Queen."&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "s116"/&gt; While the bust was under American control, Egypt requested the [[United States]] to hand it over; the USA refused and advised Egypt to take up the matter with the new German authorities.&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt; In 1989, the Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] viewed the bust and announced that Nefertiti was "the best ambassador for Egypt" in Berlin.&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt;

Dr. [[Zahi Hawass]], the former Secretary General of the Egyptian [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]], believes that Nefertiti belongs to Egypt and that the bust was taken out of Egypt illegally and should therefore be returned. Dr. Hawass has maintained the stance that Egyptian authorities were misled over the acquisition of Nefertiti in 1913. He has demanded that Germany prove that it was exported legally.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/arts/design/24abroad.html?_r=1&amp;hpw|title=When Ancient Artifacts Become Political Pawns|last=Kimmelman |first=Michael|date=23 October 2009|work=New York Times|accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kurt G. Siehr, another argument in support of repatriation is that "Archeological finds have their 'home' in the country of origin and should be preserved in that country."&lt;ref&gt;Siehr pp. 133–4&lt;/ref&gt; The Nefertiti repatriation issue sprang up again in 2003 over the ''Body of Nefertiti'' sculpture. In 2005, Hawass requested [[UNESCO]] to intervene to return the bust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=El-Aref |first=Nevine |date=14–20 July 2005 |title=Antiquities wish list |journal=[[Al-Ahram]] Weekly |issue=751 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/751/eg7.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916194918/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/751/eg7.htm |archivedate=16 September 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Hawass threatened to ban exhibitions of Egyptian artifacts in Germany if Nefertiti was not lent to Egypt, but to no avail. Hawass also requested a worldwide boycott of loans to German museums to initiate what he calls a "scientific war". Hawass wanted Germany to at least lend the bust to Egypt in 2012 for the opening of the new Grand Egyptian Museum near the [[Giza Necropolis|Great Pyramids]] of Giza.&lt;ref name = "natgeo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/070418-nefertiti-egypt.html|title=Egypt Vows "Scientific War" If Germany Doesn't Loan Nefertiti|last=Dan Morrison|date=18 April 2007|work=National Geographic News|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, a campaign called "Nefertiti Travels" was launched by cultural association CulturCooperation, based in [[Hamburg]], Germany. They distributed postcards depicting the bust of Nefertiti with the words "Return to Sender" and wrote an open letter to the German Culture Minister, [[Bernd Neumann]], supporting the view that Egypt should be given the bust on loan.&lt;ref name = "bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nofretete-geht-auf-reisen.de/ewelcome.htm|title=Nefertiti travels|year=2007|publisher=CulturCooperation|accessdate=22 November 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518042558/http://www.nofretete-geht-auf-reisen.de/ewelcome.htm|archivedate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, when Nefertiti moved back to the Neues Museum&amp;nbsp;– her old home, the appropriateness of Berlin as the bust's location was questioned.

Several German art experts have attempted to refute all the claims made by Hawass, pointing to the 1924 document discussing the pact between Borchardt and the Egyptian authorities,&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPIEGEL"/&gt; though, as discussed earlier, Borchardt has been accused of foul play in the deal. The German authorities have also argued the bust is too fragile to transport and that the legal arguments for the repatriation were insubstantial. According to ''[[The Times]]'', Germany may be concerned that lending the bust to Egypt would mean its permanent departure from Germany.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article6881619.ece|title=Neues Museum refuses to return the bust of Queen Nefertiti to Egyptian museum|last=Roger Boyes|date=20 October 2009 |work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=15 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "natgeo"/&gt;

In December 2009 Friederike Seyfried, the director of Berlin's Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection, presented to the Egyptians documents held by the museum regarding the discovery of the bust which include a protocol signed by the German excavator of the bust and the Egyptian Antiquities Service. In the documents, the object was listed as a painted plaster bust of a princess. But in the diary of Ludwig Borchardt he clearly referred to it as the head of Nefertiti. "This proves that Borchardt wrote this description so that his country can get the statue," Hawass commented "These materials confirm Egypt's contention that (he) did act unethically with intent to deceive." However, Hawass said Egypt didn't consider the Nefertiti bust to be a looted antiquity. Still, it is one of a handful of truly singular Egyptian antiquities still in foreign hands. "I really want it back," he said.&lt;ref name = "natgeo"/&gt; Hawass' statement quoted the director of the museum as saying the authority to approve the return of the bust to Egypt lies with the Prussian Cultural Heritage and the German culture minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2009/12/20/egypt_antiquities_chief_to_demand_nefertiti_bust/ The Associated Press:Egypt antiquities chief to demand Nefertiti bust] {{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations over authenticity===
The French book, ''Le Buste de Nefertiti&amp;nbsp;– une Imposture de l'Egyptologie?'' (''The Bust of Nefertiti&amp;nbsp;– a Fraud in Egyptology?'') by Swiss art historian [[Henri Stierlin]] and the book ''Missing Link in Archaeology'' by Berlin author and historian Erdogan Ercivan both claimed that the Nefertiti bust was a modern fake. Stierlin claims that Borchardt may have created the bust to test ancient pigments and that when the bust was admired by [[Prince Johann Georg of Saxony]], Borchardt pretended it was genuine to avoid offending the prince. Stierlin argues that the missing left eye of the bust would have been a sign of disrespect in ancient Egypt, that no scientific records of the bust appear until 11 years after its supposed discovery, and while the paint pigments are ancient, the inner limestone core has never been dated. Ercivan suggests Borchardt's wife was the model for the bust, and both authors argue that it was not revealed to the public until 1924 because it was a fake.&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt; Another theory suggested that the existing Nefertiti bust was crafted in the 1930s on Hitler's orders, and that the original was lost in World War II.&lt;ref name="mons"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/science/news/article_1473370.php/Nefertiti_s_hidden_face_proves_Berlin_bust_is_not_Hitler_s_fake |title=Nefertiti's 'hidden face' proves Berlin bust is not Hitler's fake |date=27 April 2009 |work=[[Science News]] |accessdate=23 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704110319/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/science/news/article_1473370.php/Nefertiti_s_hidden_face_proves_Berlin_bust_is_not_Hitler_s_fake |archivedate=4 July 2012 |df=dmy }} For pictures, {{cite news |url=http://www.antinopolis.org/hernestus/archaeologyheadlines.html |title=Nefertiti's 'Hidden Face' Proves Famous Berlin Bust is  not Hitler's Fake |date=3 April 2009 |accessdate=23 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stamps of Germany (Berlin) 1988, MiNr 814.jpg|thumb|In 1989, a 70 [[pfennig]] stamp which featured the bust of Nefertiti was on issue in Germany.]]
Dietrich Wildung dismissed the claims as a publicity stunt, as radiological tests, detailed computer tomography, and material analysis have proved its authenticity.&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/may/07/nefertiti-bust-berlin-egypt-authenticity|title=Is this Nefertiti&amp;nbsp;– or a 100-year-old fake?|last=Connolly |first=Kate |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 November 2009|date = 7 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pigments used on the bust have been matched to those used by ancient Egyptian artisans. The 2006 [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] that discovered the "hidden face" of Nefertiti proved without doubt&amp;nbsp;– according to ''[[Science News]]''&amp;nbsp;– that the bust was genuine.&lt;ref name="mons"/&gt;

Egyptian authorities also dismissed Stierlin's theory. Dr Zahi Hawass said "Stierlin is not a historian. He is delirious."  Although Stierlin had argued "Egyptians cut shoulders horizontally" and Nefertiti had vertical shoulders, Hawass said that the new style seen in the Nefertiti bust is part of the changes introduced by Akhenaten, the husband of Nefertiti. Hawass also claimed that the sculptor Thutmose had created the eye, but it was later destroyed.&lt;ref name = "digital"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szabo |first=Christopher|date=12 May 2009|title=Egypt's Rubbishes Claims that Nefertiti Bust is 'Fake'|journal=DigitalJournal.com|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/272498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Body of Nefertiti''===
In 2003, the Egyptian Museum in Berlin allowed the Hungarian artist duo [[Little Warsaw]], András Gálik and Bálint Havas, to place the bust atop a nearly nude female bronze for a video installation to be shown at the [[Venice Biennale]] modern art festival. The project called the ''Body of Nefertiti'' was, according to the artists, an attempt to pay homage to the bust. According to Wildung, it showed "the continued relevance of the ancient world to today's art."&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt; However, Egyptian cultural officials took offense and proclaimed it to be a disgrace to "one of the great symbols of their country's history". As a consequence, they also banned Wildung and his wife from further exploration in Egypt.&lt;ref name = "natgeo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/21/arts/nefertiti-s-bust-gets-a-body-offending-egyptians.html|title=Nefertiti's Bust Gets a Body, Offending Egyptians|last=HUGH EAKIN|date=21 June 2003|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a picture of "The Body of Nefertiti" see {{cite web|url=https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/wash/www/nefertiti.htm|title=Nefertiti's Bust Gets a Body, Offending Egyptians: A Problematic Juxtaposition|date=21 June 2003|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=23 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008194009/https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/wash/www/nefertiti.htm|archivedate=8 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian Minister for Culture, [[Farouk Hosny]], declared that Nefertiti was "not in safe hands", and although Egypt had not renewed their claims for restitution "due to the good relations with Germany," this "recent behaviour" was unacceptable.&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt;

==Cultural significance==
In 1930, the German press described the Nefertiti bust as their new monarch, personifying it as a queen. As the "'most precious&amp;nbsp;... stone in the setting of the [[diadem]]' from the art treasures of 'Prussia Germany'", Nefertiti would re-establish the imperial German national identity after 1918.&lt;ref name = "b291"/&gt; Hitler described the bust as "a unique masterpiece, an ornament, a true treasure", and pledged to build a museum to house it.&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt; By the 1970s, the bust had become an issue of national identity to both German states—[[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]]—created after World War II.&lt;ref name = "b291"&gt;Breger p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Nefertiti appeared on an election poster for the green political party [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Bündnis 90/Die Grünen]] as a promise for cosmopolitan and multi-cultural environment with the slogan "Strong Women for Berlin!"&lt;ref name = "b292"&gt;Breger p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; According to Claudia Breger, another reason that the Nefertiti bust became associated with a German national identity was its place as a rival to the Tutankhamun find by the British, who then ruled Egypt.&lt;ref name = "b292"/&gt;

The bust became an influence on popular culture with [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]]'s make-up work on [[Elsa Lanchester]]'s iconic hair style in the film ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' being inspired by it.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Young, "Here Comes the Bride: Wedding Gender and Race in Bride of Frankenstein"; ''Feminist Studies'', Vol. 17, 1991. 35 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Cliff's first book, ''The Shakespeare Riots: Revenge, Drama, and Death in Nineteenth-century America'', was published in the [[United States]] by [[Random House]] in 2007. Centring on a feud between leading Shakespearean actors [[William Charles Macready]] and [[Edwin Forrest]] that led to the deadly [[Astor Place Riot]] of 1849, it dramatises the birth of the American entertainment industry and demonstrates the centrality of Shakespeare to nineteenth-century American identity.

Writing in the [[London Review of Books]], Michael Dobson called the book 'wonderful... a brilliant debut... both enthralling and scholarly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobson|first1=Michael|title=Let him be Caesar!|journal=London Review of Books|date=2 August 2007|volume=29|issue=15|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n15/michael-dobson/let-him-be-caesar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Phillip Lopate]] called it 'Brilliantly engrossing... exemplary... engaging, worldly, fluent... crammed with entertaining nuggets.'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopate|first1=Phillip|title=What fools these mortals be|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=15 April 2007|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/15/books/bk-lopate15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']] Book of the Year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Book World's Holiday Issue|journal=The Washington Post|date=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a finalist for the National Award for Arts Writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Marfield Prize|url=http://artsclubofwashington.org/public-programs-2/award-for-arts-writing/2007-marfield-prize-winner-finalists/|website=Arts Club of Washington|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cliff wrote the adapted screenplay for Muse Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodridge|first1=Mike|title=Muse lines up slate of hot literary adaptations|journal=Screen International|date=15 May 2011|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/muse-lines-up-slate-of-hot-literary-adaptations/5027532.article|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliff's second book was ''Holy War: How Vasco da Gama's Epic Voyages Turned the Tide in a Centuries-old Clash of Civilisations'' (Harper, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holy War|url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780061735127/holy-war|website=Harpercollins publishers llc|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently issued as ''The Last Crusade: The Epic Voyages of Vasco da Gama'' by Harper Perennial in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Last Crusade|url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780061735134/the-last-crusade|website=Harpercollins publishers llc|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published under the latter name by Atlantic in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of the Week|url=http://atlantic-books.co.uk/content/follow-last-crusade-nigel-cliff|website=Atlantic books|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the former name in Portugal, Brazil, Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Poland, with publication forthcoming in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigel Cliff official website|website=www.nigelcliff.com|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a ''New York Times'' Notable Book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Notable Books of 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/books/review/100-notable-books-of-2011.html?pagewanted=all|website=The New York Times|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was shortlisted for the PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize for History 2013 shortlist announced|url=https://www.englishpen.org/prizes/english-pen-hessell-tiltman-prize-for-history-2013-shortlist-announced/|website=English PEN|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''New York Times'' Eric Ormsby wrote: "Cliff has a novelist's gift for depicting character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ormsby|first1=Eric|title=Why Vasco da Gama Went to India|date=9 September 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/books/review/holy-war-by-nigel-cliff-book-review.html?_r=0|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' James McConnachie called the book 'stirringly epic...[a] thrilling narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McConnachie|first1=James|title=The Last Crusade|journal=Sunday Times|date=1 April 2012|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/books/non_fiction/article1004258.ece|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliff's third book was a new translation and critical edition of [[The Travels of Marco Polo|''Marco Polo's Travels'']] for [[Penguin Classics]], which was released in the UK and U.S. in 2015. For this first all-new translation in a half-century, he went back to the original texts in French, Latin and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Travels|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/183574/the-travels/|website=Penguin|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paleolithic Continuity Theory''' (or '''PCT'''; Italian:  ''La teoria della continuità''), since 2010 relabelled as a "[[paradigm]]", as in ''Paleolithic Continuity Paradigm'' or ''PCP''), is a [[hypothesis]] suggesting that the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE) can be traced back to the [[Upper Paleolithic]], several millennia earlier than the [[Chalcolithic]] or at the most [[Neolithic]] estimates in other scenarios of [[Proto-Indo-European origins]].
 
As advanced by [[Mario Alinei]] in his ''Origini delle Lingue d’Europa'' (Origins of the Languages of Europe), published in two volumes in 1996 and 2000,&lt;ref&gt;
La teoria della continuità (1996), Bologna : Mulino 
{{ISBN|88-15-05513-4}}, 779 pages [http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/show?pid=991850033&amp;kid=biblio];  ''Continuità dal Mesolitico all'età del Ferro nelle principali aree etnolinguistiche'' (2000) Bologna : Mulino,  {{ISBN|88-15-07386-8}}, 1113 pages 
[http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/show?pid=060916621&amp;kid=biblio].&lt;/ref&gt; the PCT posits that the advent of Indo-European languages should be linked to the arrival of [[European early modern humans|Homo sapiens in Europe]], at around 40,000 years ago. 
Employing "lexical periodisation", Alinei arrives at a timeline deeper than even that of [[Colin Renfrew]]'s [[Anatolian hypothesis]], previously the mainstream linguistic theory proposing the earliest origin for Indo-European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alinei|first1=Mario|authorlink1=Mario Alinei|last2=Benozzo|first2=Francesco|url=http://www.continuitas.org/intro.html|title=The Paleolithic Continuity Theory on Indo-European Origins: An Introduction in progress|website=continuitas.org|date=December 2016|accessdate=27 March 2017|quote=The sharp differentiation of farming terminology in the different IE languages, while absolutely unexplainable in the context of [[Anatolian hypothesis|Renfrew's NDT]], provides yet another fundamental proof that the differentiation of IE languages goes back to remote prehistory. This is admitted even by a few traditionalists: as Francisco Villar writes, "in the common [Indoeuropean] language a lexicon connected to farming does not exist or hardly exists" and "the common IE terminology for farming is so scarce to allow a dilemma to rise: it is possible that the IEs' knowledge of farming was modest, […] but it is even possible that they had no knowledge of farming at all " (Villar 1991: 81). While this finding can be easily explained within the PCP, it becomes a huge problem once Neolithic intrusive farmers have been assumed to be the Proto-IEs: "This hypothesis clashes with the Neolithic thesis […] according to which IEs would essentially be the inventors of farming, which would be the most important and characteristic activity of their society", and "It is unthinkable that the people who invented and diffused farming would not have a rich and specific lexicon to designate the elements and the techniques of farming" (ibid).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004, an informal workgroup of scholars who support the Paleolithic Continuity Theory has been held online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.continuitas.org/workgroup.html|title=The Paleolithic Continuity Paradigm for the Origins of Indo-European Languages|publisher=continuitas.org|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the group (referred to as "Scientific Committee" in the website) include linguists [[Xaverio Ballester]] ([[University of Valencia]]) and [[Francesco Benozzo]] ([[University of Bologna]]), prehistorian [[Marcel Otte]] ([[Université de Liège]]) and anthropologist [[Henry Harpending]] ([[University of Utah]]).&lt;ref name=continuitas&gt;[http://www.continuitas.org/intro.html Alinei, Mario. ''The Paleolithic Continuity Theory on Indo-European Origins: An Introduction'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paleolithic Continuity Theory is distinctly a minority view as it enjoys very little academic support, serious discussion being limited to a small circle of scholars. 
It is not listed by Mallory among the [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|proposals for the origins of the Indo-European languages]] that are widely discussed and considered credible within academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallory|first=James P.|authorlink=J.P. Mallory|contribution=The homelands of the Indo-Europeans|editor-last=Blench|editor-first=Roger|editor2-last=Spriggs|editor2-first=Matthew|title=Archaeology and Language|publication-place=London|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|volume=I: ''Theoretical and Methodological Orientations''|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The framework of PCT is laid out by Alinei in four main assumptions:&lt;ref name=continuitas/&gt;

# Continuity is the basic pattern of European prehistory and the basic working hypothesis on the origins of IE languages.
# Stability and antiquity are general features of languages.
# The lexicon of natural languages, due to its antiquity, may be "periodized" along the entire course of human evolution.
# Archaeological frontiers coincide with linguistic frontiers.

The continuity theory draws on a Continuity Model (CM), positing the presence of IE and non-IE peoples and languages in Europe from Paleolithic times and allowing for minor invasions and infiltrations of local scope, mainly during the last three millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/filologija/alinei/malinei-continuity.html|title=An alternative model for the origins of European peoples and languages: The Continuity Theory (summary)|publisher=Projekat Rastko|first=Mario|last=Alinei|authorlink=Mario Alinei|date=28 October 1999|accessdate=22 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222080941/http://www.rastko.org.rs/filologija/alinei/malinei-continuity.html|archivedate=22 December 2014|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing that continuity is "the archeologist's easiest pursuit," Alinei deems this "the easiest working hypothesis," putting the burden of proof on competing hypotheses as long as none provide irrefutable counter-evidence. Alinei also claims linguistic coherence, rigor and productivity in the pursuit of this approach.&lt;ref name=continuitas/&gt;

==Historical reconstruction==
Associated with the Paleolithic Continuity Theory (PCT) is the historical reconstruction proposed by Alinei, which suggests that Indo-European speakers were native in Europe since the [[paleolithic]]. According to this reconstruction, the differentiation process of languages would have taken an extremely long time; by the end of the Ice Age the Indo-European language family had differentiated into proto [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]/[[Italic languages|Italic]]/[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]/[[Slavic languages|Slavic]]/[[Baltic languages|Baltic]] speakers occupying territories within or close to their traditional homelands. The rate of change accelerated when (Neolithic) social stratification and colonial wars began. Summarizing:&lt;ref name=continuitas/&gt;

# The colonial expansion of the Celts started much earlier than [[La Tène culture]] and proceeded (generally) from West to East, not vice versa.
# The Mesolithic cultures of Northern Europe are identified with already differentiated Celtic, Germanic, Baltic and Uralic groups.
# Scandinavia was colonized by Germanic groups "only" after deglaciation, and was better able to preserve its original character in isolation. Germany, in contrast, suffered fragmentation as a result of the Neolithic appearance of the [[Linear Pottery culture]], and developed a wealth of dialects.
# The prehistoric distribution of proto-languages akin to Italic was an important factor underlying the current distribution of Romance languages throughout Europe.
# The Slavic languages originated in the [[Balkans]] and became linked with the Neolithic expansion. This group would be especially identified by the [[Baden culture]].&lt;ref name=hungarian&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.continuitas.com/etruscan.pdf|last=Alinei|first=Mario|title=Etruscan: an archaic form of Hungarian (book summary)|website=continuitas.com|date=2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228072949/http://www.continuitas.com/etruscan.pdf|archivedate=28 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paleolithic Continuity hypothesis reverses the Kurgan hypothesis and largely identifies the Indo-Europeans with [[Marija Gimbutas|Gimbutas]]'s "Old Europe."&lt;ref&gt;Gimbutas, Marija. "Old Europe c.7000-3500 BC., the earliest European cultures before the infiltration of the Indo-European peoples". ''Journal of Indo-European Studies'', 1, 1973, pp. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; PCT reassigns the Kurgan culture (traditionally considered early Indo-European) to a people of predominantly mixed [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] stock. Alinei argues that the use of borrowed Turkic words in horse terminology, such as ''qaptï'' ("to grab with hands and teeth"), ''yabu'' ("horse"), ''yam'' ("nomadic caravan-tent"), ''yuntă'' ("horse" (generic)), ''aygur'' ("stallion"), ''homut'' ("horse collar") and ''alaša'' ("pack horse"), in [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]] (Northern and Southern), in some [[Finno-Ugric languages]] and [[Slavic languages]], "proves the antiquity of Turkic presence in the European area bordering Asia." He suggests that horse domestication originated with Turkic peoples, offering this as an explanation why horse terminology in the European area bordering [[Asia]] and in most of [[Eastern Europe]] is rooted in Turkic and not Indo-European vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Alinei1"&gt;Mario Alinei ('''2003'''), "[http://www.continuitas.org/texts/alinei_interdisciplinary.pdf Interdisciplinary and linguistic evidence for Paleolithic continuity of Indo-European, Uralic and Altaic populations in Eurasia, with an excursus on Slavic ethnogenesis]", Quaderni di semantica, vol. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; He supports this hypothesis by making a tentative linguistic identification of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] as a Uralic, [[proto-Hungarian]] people that had already undergone strong [[proto-Turkic]] influence in the third millennium BC,&lt;ref name=hungarian/&gt; when Pontic invasions would have brought this people to the Carpathian Basin. A subsequent migration of [[Urnfield culture]] signature around 1250 BC is said to have caused this ethnic group to expand south in a general movement of people. This is equated with the upheaval of the [[Sea Peoples]] and the overthrow of an earlier Italic substrate at the onset of the "Etruscan" [[Villanovan culture]].&lt;ref name=hungarian/&gt;

==Genetics==
In introduction to PCT [[Mario Alinei]] argues, following [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli Sforza]], that the distribution of genetic markers largely corresponds to that of languages. He further contends that 80 percent of Europe's human genetic material dates back to the Paleolithic, and cites [[Bryan Sykes]] in claiming that only a fifth of European DNA can be traced back to neolithic incomers.&lt;ref name=continuitas/&gt;

A 2009 study comparing mitochondrial DNA lineages of late hunter-gatherers, early farmers, and modern Europeans found large differences between the three groups. In particular, 82 percent of hunter-gatherers had maternal lineages that are rare in modern central Europeans.&lt;ref name=discontinuity&gt;{{cite news|first=B.|last=Bramanti| title=We Are Not Our Ancestors: Evidence for Discontinuity between Prehistoric and Modern Europeans|date=3 September 2009|work=sciencemag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of paternal lineages remains difficult to prove because modern science is unable to extract Y-DNA haplogroups from Paleolithic samples. However, the recent analysis of Arredi, Poloni and Tyler-Smith (2007) suggests that [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b-M269]], the most common western European haplogroup, may have entered Europe only in the Neolithic.&lt;ref name="neolithic"&gt;{{cite news | author = Arredi, Poloni and Tyler-Smith | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tlSspaBLkhoC&amp;pg=PA380&amp;lpg=PA394#PPA394,M1 | title = The Peopling of Europe | year = 2007 | work = Michael Crawford, Anthropological Genetics, pp. 380-408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Alinei's ''Origini delle Lingue d’Europa'' was reviewed favourably in 1996 by Jonathan Morris in ''[[Mother Tongue (journal)|Mother Tongue]]'', a journal dedicated to the reconstruction of Paleolithic language, judging Alinei's theory as being
&lt;blockquote&gt;both simpler than its rivals and more powerful in terms of the insights it provides into language in the Meso- and Palaeolithic. While his book contains some flaws I believe that it deserves to be regarded as one of the seminal texts on linguistic archaeology, although given its lamentable lack of citation in English-language circles, it appears that recognition will have to wait until a translation of the original Italian appears.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Morris's review was reprinted as the foreword to the 2000 edition of Alinei's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.continuitas.com/morrisrev2.pdf|last=Morris|first=Jonathan|title=Review: Mario Alinei - Origini delle Lingue d'Europa [Origins of the Languages of Europe]; Volume 1 – Teoria della Continuità [The Continuity Theory], Volume 2 – Continuità dal Mesolítico all'età di ferro nelle principali aree etnolinguistiche [Continuities from the Mesolithic to the Iron Age in the Principal Ethnolinguistic Areas] (Il Mulino – Bologna, 1996 and 2000)|website=continuitas.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108210112/http://www.continuitas.com/morrisrev2.pdf|archivedate=8 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renzi (1997) sharply criticized Alinei's book, refuting in particular the claim of the presence of Latin and of its different territorial forms in Italy in the 2nd millennium BC. Renzi argues that this theory would subvert firmly established concepts of Romance philology and dialectology, such as the concepts of [[substratum]], [[vulgar Latin]] and so on.&lt;ref&gt;''Alinei, ovvero il latino prima di Roma'', RID. Rivista italiana di dialettologia, ISSN 1122-6331, 1997, vol. 21, pp. 191-202.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Alinei's theory was again critically reviewed by Adiego Lajara (2002):&lt;ref&gt;Ignasi-Xavier Adiego Lajara , ''Indoeuropeïtzació al paleolític? Algunes reflexions sobre la "teoria della continuità" de Mario Alinei'', Estudis romànics, ISSN 0211-8572, Nº. 24, 2002, pp. 7-30 .&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Although some of Alinei's reflections on linguistic change are very interesting, it should be said that certain conceptions in his work&amp;nbsp;– such as the excessive immobility of languages or the relationship between types of language and progress in the prehistoric lithic industry&amp;nbsp;– are very debatable. Alinei's core theory&amp;nbsp;– continuity from the Palaeolithic&amp;nbsp;– runs into a serious difficulty: it obliges us to deal with words traditionally reconstructed for Indo-European, referring to notions that did not exist in the Palaeolithic as loans, when from the formal standpoint they are indistinguishable from those Alinei sees as being Indo-European in the Palaeolithic period.}}

In literary and historical analysis, '''presentism''' is the [[anachronism|anachronistic]] introduction of present-day ideas and perspectives into depictions or interpretations of the past. Some modern historians seek to avoid presentism in their work because they consider it a form of [[cultural bias]], and believe it creates a distorted understanding of their subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/may-2002/against-presentism |author=[[Lynn_Hunt|Hunt, Lynn]]. |title=Against Presentism &amp;#124; AHA |publisher=''Historians.org,'' May 2002 |accessdate=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of presentism is regarded by some as a common fallacy in historical writing.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, David H. ''Historian's Fallacies,'' 1970, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the first citation for ''presentism'' in its historiographic sense from 1916, and the word may have been used in this meaning as early as the 1870s. The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] identifies presentism as a [[fallacy]] also known as the "fallacy of ''[[nunc pro tunc]]''". He has written that the "classic example" of presentism was the so-called "[[Whig history]]", in which certain 18th- and 19th-century British historians wrote history in a way that used the past to validate their own political beliefs. This interpretation was presentist because it did not depict the past in objective historical context but instead viewed history only through the lens of contemporary Whig beliefs. In this kind of approach, which emphasizes the relevance of history to the present, things that do not seem relevant receive little attention, which results in a misleading portrayal of the past. "Whig history" or "whiggishness" are often used as synonyms for ''presentism'' particularly when the historical depiction in question is [[teleology|teleological]] or [[triumphalism|triumphalist]].&lt;ref name="Fischer139"&gt;Fischer, David H. ''Historian's Fallacies,'' 1970, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological analysis==
Presentism has a shorter history in sociological analysis, where it has been used to describe [[technological determinism|technological determinists]] who interpret a change in behavior as starting with the introduction of a new technology. For example, scholars such as [[Frances Cairncross]] proclaimed that the Internet had led to "the death of distance", but most [[community]] ties and many business ties had been transcontinental and even intercontinental for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry. "Physical Place and Cyber Place: The Rise of Networked Individualism," ''International Journal of Urban and Regional Research'' '''25'''.2 (June, 2001): 227-52. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral judgments==
Presentism is also a factor in the problematic question of history and [[morality|moral]] judgments. Among historians, the orthodox view may be that reading modern notions of morality into the past is to commit the error of presentism. To avoid this, historians restrict themselves to describing what happened and attempt to refrain from using language that passes judgment. For example, when writing history about [[slavery]] in an era when the practice was widely accepted, letting that fact influence judgment about a group or individual would be presentist and thus should be avoided.

Critics respond that to avoid moral judgments is to practice [[moral relativism]], a controversial idea. Some religious historians argue that morality is timeless, having been established by God; they say it is not anachronistic to apply timeless standards to the past. (In this view, while [[mores]] may change, [[morality]] does not.)

Others argue that application of religious standards has varied over time as well. [[Saint Augustine]], for example, holds that there exist timeless moral principles, but contends that certain practices (such as [[polygamy]]) were acceptable in the past because they were customary but now are neither customary nor acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip, and Henry Wace. ''A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church'', Vol. III, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1908, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer, for his part, writes that while historians might not always manage to avoid the fallacy completely, they should at least try to be aware of their biases and write history in such a way that they do not create a distorted depiction of the past.&lt;ref name="Fischer139"/&gt;

'''Pumpkin bombs''' were conventional aerial bombs developed by the [[Manhattan Project]] and used by the United States Army Air Forces against Japan during [[World War II]]. It was a close replication of the [[Fat Man]] [[plutonium]] bomb with the same ballistic and handling characteristics, but it used non-nuclear conventional [[high explosives]]. It was mainly used for testing and training purposes, which included combat missions flown with pumpkin bombs by the [[509th Composite Group]]. The name "pumpkin bomb" was the actual reference term used in official documents from the large, fat ellipsoidal shape of the munition casing instead of the more usual cylindrical shape of other bombs, intended to enclose the Fat Man's spherical "physics package" (the [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|plutonium implosion]] nuclear weapon core).

== Development ==
Pumpkin bombs were a means of providing realistic training with non-nuclear bombs for the 509th Composite Group's [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] crews assigned to drop the [[atomic bomb]]. The pumpkin bomb had the same weight, size, and weight distribution as the [[Fat Man]] plutonium bomb, giving it the same [[External ballistics|ballistic]] and handling characteristics.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=74–75}} Specifications for the bomb required that it be carried in the forward [[bomb bay]] of a [[Silverplate]] B-29 bomber and be [[fuze]]d to be effective against actual targets.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=72–73}}

Pumpkin bombs were produced in both inert and high-explosive variants. The inert versions were filled with a cement-plaster-sand mixture that was combined with water to {{convert|1.67|to|1.68|g/cm3}}, the density of the [[Composition B]] high-explosive versions. The filler of both variants had the same weight and weight distribution as the inner spherical "physics package" of the Fat Man plutonium bomb.

The concept for the high-explosive pumpkin bomb was originated in December 1944 by [[U.S. Navy]] [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]], the head of the Ordnance Division at [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], and [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Paul W. Tibbets]], commander of the [[509th Composite Group]]. Prior testing was carried out with an inert version.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=74–75}}

The name "pumpkin bomb" originated with Parsons and Dr. [[Charles Christian Lauritsen|Charles C. Lauritsen]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]], who managed the development team.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=72–73}} The name was used for the training bombs in official meetings and documents,&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt; and probably derived from its large [[ellipsoid]]al shape.
On the other hand, anecdotal sources attribute the naming of the bombs to a [[pumpkin (color)|pumpkin color]]: While the bombs were painted olive drab or khaki in the field, photographs show that at least the units delivered to [[Tinian]] were shipped in the same yellow [[zinc chromate]] primer color worn by Fat Man.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|pp=184–185}}{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=220}}

While many Manhattan scientists expected that the development of the means of delivery of the atomic bomb would be straightforward, Parsons, with his experience of the [[proximity fuze]] program, expected that it would involve considerable effort.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=378–381}} The test program was initiated on 13 August 1943 at the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division|Naval Proving Ground]] in [[Dahlgren, Virginia]], where a scale model of the Fat Man plutonium bomb was developed. On 3 March 1944, testing moved to [[Edwards Air Force Base|Muroc Army Air Field]], California. The initial tests demonstrated that the Fat Man assembly was unstable in flight, and that its fuzes did not work properly.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=378–381}}

== Production ==
The shells of the pumpkin bomb were manufactured by two [[Los Angeles]] firms, [[Consolidated Steel Corporation]] and [[Western Pipe and Steel Company]], while the tail assembly was produced by [[Centerline Company]] of [[Detroit]]. After initial development, management of the program was turned over to the U.S. Navy [[Bureau of Ordnance]] in May 1945.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=72–73}} A total of 486 live and inert training bombs were eventually delivered, at a cost of between $1,000 and $2,000 apiece.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=74–75}}

All of the inert versions went from the manufacturers directly to [[Wendover Army Air Field]], Utah, by rail, where they were used by the 216th Base Unit in flight testing of the bomb. Some test drop missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group's [[393d Bombardment Squadron]] as training exercises.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=74–75}} The bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to the Naval Ammunition Depot, [[McAlester, Oklahoma]], for filling with explosives. The Composition B was poured as a [[slurry]], solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours, sealed, and shipped by railroad to the [[Port Chicago Naval Magazine]], California, for shipment by sea to Tinian.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=74–75}}&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/9.pdf |title=National Archives, minutes of third target committee meeting, May 28. 1945 |publisher=[[George Washington University]] |accessdate=25 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The pumpkin bombs were externally similar to the Fat Man bomb in size and shape, and both had the same {{convert|52|in|cm|adj=on}} ''California Parachute'' square tail assembly and single-point attachment lug. The pumpkin bomb had three [[contact fuze]]s arranged in an [[equilateral triangle]] around the nose of the bomb while the atomic bomb had four fuse housings. The atomic bomb had its shell sections bolted together and sealed with externally-applied, sprayed-on liquid asphalt, but most if not all of the pumpkin bombs were welded, with a four-inch hole used for filling the shell. The Fat Man also had four external mounting points for [[radar]] [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] which the pumpkin bombs did not have.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=74–75}}{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|pp=184–185}}

The pumpkin bombs were {{convert|10|ft|8|in}} in length and {{convert|60|in}} in maximum diameter. They weighed {{convert|5.26|lt|kg}}, consisting of {{convert|3800|lb}} for the shell, {{convert|425|lb}} for the tail assembly, and {{convert|6300|lb}} of Composition B filler. The shells were made of {{convert|.375|in|adj=on}} [[Structural steel|steel plate]] and the tail assemblies from {{convert|.200|in|adj=on}} [[Aluminium|aluminum]] [[Sheet metal|plate]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=74–75}}

==Combat missions==
Combat missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group on 20, 23, 26 and 29 July and 8 and 14 August 1945, using the bombs against individual targets in Japanese cities. A total of 49 bombs were dropped on 14 targets, one bomb was jettisoned into the ocean, and two were aboard aircraft that aborted their missions.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=27, 104}}

Mission parameters and protocols were similar to those of the actual atomic bomb missions, and all targets were located in the vicinity of the cities designated for atomic attack. The bombs were released at an altitude of {{convert|30000|ft}} and the aircraft then went into the sharp turn required on a nuclear mission. After the war, the [[Strategic Bombing Survey]] concluded that the pumpkin bombs were "a reasonably effective weapon against Japanese plants when direct hits were scored on vital areas, or when the near miss was sufficiently close to important buildings to cause severe structural damage."{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=73}}

[[File:Ronald Vere Tooley02.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Cover of "''The Map Collector''"&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Ronald Vere Tooley''' (29 September 1898 - 12 October 1986) was an English map dealer, an authority on early maps and cartographers, a noted compiler of catalogues on maps, cartography and antiquarian books, author of ''Maps and Map-makers'', and founder of the [[Map Collectors' Circle]] which published a series of  monographs on historical cartography in the period 1963-1975. He is considered the founder of the antiquarian map trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstpedia.com/articles/r-v-tooley---an-appreciation-by-robert-stockwell.html ''An Appreciation by Robert Stockwell'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03085698708592619 | volume=39 | title=Ronald Vere Tooley (1898–1986) | year=1987 | journal=Imago Mundi | pages=80–81 | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tooley was born on [[Michaelmas]] and adopted the nickname "Mick".

==Career==
Tooley was born and raised in [[Islington]], London, and educated at the [[City of London School]]. Towards the end of [[World War I]] he enlisted in the [[Queen's Westminsters|Queen's Westminster Rifles]]. After his basic training he left for France and took part in the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle of Cambrai]], where he was one of 120 survivors from an initial force of 400 men. On being demobilised in 1919 and having no definite career plans, he came across an illustrated catalogue of antiquarian books, published by [http://www.aba.org.uk/aba-past-presidents/322-james-tregaskis James Tregaskis] of [[Great Russell Street]]. The idea of working in the bookselling field appealed to him, and armed with a letter of introduction he made the acquaintance of Francis Edwards Ltd., and was summarily employed.

After [[World War I]] the book trade enjoyed a time of relative prosperity, but with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street collapse]] in 1929, economic depression hit the commercial sector in many countries, the secondhand book trade being no exception. In the 1930s Tooley left Francis Edwards Ltd and opened The Atlas Bookshop, just off [[Charing Cross Road]], and started dealing almost exclusively in antiquarian maps. Between 1932 and 1934 he collaborated with a Mr M. Sinelnikoff of Orion Booksellers Ltd. Sinelnikoff's passion was old maps, charts and globes, and with Tooley's interest, a fertile conjunction of scholarly minds was created. Tooley had always been interested in Colour Plate books, and in 1935 Batsford published his first book on the subject ''Some English Books with Coloured Plates''. When The Atlas Bookshop closed in 1936 Tooley started work at the Parker Gallery in [[Albemarle Street]] - the firm specialising in military and sporting prints as well as old maps. With the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 Tooley found work as a telephone operator, but still worked with old books and maps in his spare time.

In 1946 the management of Francis Edwards Ltd, keenly aware of Tooley's considerable business expertise and knowledge of old maps, invited him to rejoin the firm. Here he continued his research, spending long hours in the Map Room of the [[British Museum]]. His talents soon led to his being appointed a director of the firm. In 1949 his second book ''Maps &amp; Map-makers'' was published, praised as a sound introduction and guide to a complex field, and running to many editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/selected-library-collections/tooley-collection National Library of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; Tooley retired from Francis Edwards Ltd in 1975 and in 1979 joined Peter Scott and Peter Kalms in setting up a new company R.V.Tooley Ltd, he was joined by his stepson Douglas Adams and in October 1979 his stepson Stephen Luck joined them, first trading at Tring, Hertfordshire and then in the Spring of 1980 33 Museum Street, this company closed in 1982 and became ''Tooley Adams &amp; Co''. Together they developed the firm into one of the leading antique map dealers, supplying maps to dealers, museums and libraries all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tooleys.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Map Collector's Series" is widely regarded as the greatest of Tooley's achievements. The idea of producing a series of monographs on maps was first discussed in 1960 with Robert Stockwell. The interest generated by this idea was widespread and led to The Map Collector's Circle being formed in April 1963 under Tooley and David Schrire. The series was acclaimed throughout the world, and seen as an important contribution to cartography. It also led to the founding of the Carta Press, aimed at publishing authoritative works on cartography. The first publication, in 1968, was ''Maps of the African Continent and Southern Africa'', and was followed in 1970 by ''County Atlases of the British Isles'' by [[Raleigh Ashlin Skelton|R.A. Skelton]] of the Map Room of the British Museum. ''The Map Collector'' magazine was started by Tooley in 1977 when the Map Collector's Circle ceased publishing. Each issue of ''The Map Collector'' consisted of articles and information provided by respected authorities, collectors and dealers.

==Appreciation==
In his 75th year Tooley was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]]. The [[festschrift]] ''My Head is a Map'' was compiled in 1973 for his 75th birthday by [[Helen Wallis]] and [[Sarah Tyacke]], both Map Librarians from the [[British Library]] and celebrated his contributions to the world of antiquarian maps.

[[File:Kuznetsov Sergei.jpeg|thumb|180px|Kuznetsov on 23 May 2003]]
'''Sergey Olegovich Kuznetsov''' ({{lang-ru|Серге́й Оле́гович Кузнецо́в}}; born 7 December 1960, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]) is a Russian historian and art historian, specialising in the history of the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov family]].

==Life==
Between 1981 and 1987 Kuznetsov studied Russian and world art at the Faculty of History at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]]. Ivan Chechot (Иван Дмитриевич Чечот) was one of his teachers. In 1984, in parallel with his studies, he began working at the department of painting (18th–19th centuries) at the [[Russian Museum|State Russian Museum]] and participated in preparations for the anniversary exhibition of works by [[Dmitry Levitzky]]. Art painting of Levitsky became Kuznetsov's first significant research subject and resulted in his thesis, "Official prohibitions in the work of D. G. Levitzky. Their art principles and an ideological orientation" («Официальные заказы в творчестве Д. Г. Левицкого. Их художественные принципы и идеологическая направленность», 1987) and the book ''Неизвестный Левицкий. Портретное творчество живописца в контексте петербургского мифа'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;Неизвестный Левицкий. Портретное творчество живописца в контексте петербургского мифа. — СПб., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

His further research work has included paintings of [[Jan Chrucki]],&lt;ref&gt;Живописец Иван Хруцкий: проблема интерпретации творчества «среднего художника» XIX в., Вопросы отечественного и зарубежного искусства. Вып. 4: Проблемы изобразительного искусства XIX столетия. St. Petersburg, 1990. pp. 82–99. Польский вариант: Malarz Jan Chrucki. Portret XIX-wiecznego 'artysty srednego', Biuletyn historii sztuki. R.

"Scottish architects in Tzarist Russia," ''History Today'' February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuznetsov is the author of more than 70 articles in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'' (1996). Between 1990 and 2000 he reviewed Saint Petersburg art exhibitions for the magazines «Итоги» and «Арт-хроника» and newspapers «Российская культура» and «[[Vremya Novostei|Время новостей]]».

The history of the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]] family became the second important topic of his research. In 1991, he examined the history of the [[Stroganov Palace]]. In 2006, he edited "Not worse than [[Jean-François Thomas de Thomon|Thomon]]" («Не хуже Томона»), where he described the period of 1771–1817 in the history of the Stroganovs.&lt;ref&gt;Не хуже Томона.

Три века истории''. — М-СПб: Центрполиграф, МиМ-Дельта, 2008. {{ISBN|978-5-9524-3471-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; New edition of this book with title '500 years of Strogonov' published in 2012 with special part about Marino estate of Sophia Stroganov near St. Petersburgh. At same year such monument as Strogonoff garden got his book 'Stogonov dacha. About almost disappeared monument'. In 2003, he was awarded the [[Medal "In Commemoration of the 300th Anniversary of Saint Petersburg"]] («В память 300-летия Санкт-Петербурга»).

A '''star war''' was a decisive conflict between rival polities of the [[Maya civilization]] during the first millennium AD. The term comes from a specific type of [[glyph]] used in the [[Maya script]], which depicts a star showering the earth with liquid droplets, or a star over a shell. It represents a verb but its [[phoneme|phonemic]] value and specific meaning have not yet been deciphered. The name "star war" was coined by the [[epigraphy|epigrapher]] [[Linda Schele]] to refer to the glyph, and by extension to the type of conflict that it indicates.&lt;ref name="WitscheyBrown2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witschey|first1=Walter Robert Thurmond|last2=Brown|first2=Clifford T.|title=Historical Dictionary of Mesoamerica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59jPo4mhrOcC&amp;pg=PA288|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7167-0|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Maya inscriptions assign episodes of [[Maya warfare]] to four distinct categories, each represented by its own glyph. Those accorded the greatest significance by the Maya were described with the "star war" glyph, representing a major war resulting in the defeat of one polity by another. This represents the installation of a new dynastic line of rulers, complete dominion of one polity over another, or a successful war of independence by a formerly dominated polity.&lt;ref name="D. and A. Chase 2003" /&gt;

Losing a star war could be disastrous for the defeated party. The first recorded star war in 562, between [[Caracol]] and [[Tikal]], resulted in a 120-year hiatus for the latter city. It saw a decline in Tikal's population, a cessation of monument erection, and the destruction of certain monuments in the Great Plaza.&lt;ref name="D. and A. Chase 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chase|first1=Diane|last2=Chase|first2=Arlen|chapter=Texts and Contexts in Maya Warfare: A brief Consideration of Epigraphy and Archaeology at Caracol, Belize|title=Ancient Mesoamerican Warfare|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=M.K.|editor2-last=Stanton|editor2-first=T.W.|pages=171–188|publisher=Altamira Press|location=Walnut Creek, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Calakmul]] defeated [[Naranjo]] in a star war on December 24, 631, it resulted in Naranjo's ruler being tortured to death and possibly eaten. Another star war in February 744 resulted in Tikal sacking Caracol and capturing a personal god effigy of its ruler.&lt;ref name="Robertson2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Elizabeth C.|title=Space and Spatial Analysis in Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vBnJ3rEvzLYC&amp;pg=PA357|year=2006|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-4022-1|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription from a monument found at [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] (dating from 669) describes the aftermath of a star war: "the blood was pooled, the skulls were piled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2015/tortuguero|title="The Blood Was Pooled, the Skulls Were Piled": Maya Star Wars and a Misconstrued Doomsday|last=Doyle|first=James|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|date=May 29, 2015|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomical connections==

[[Mayanist]]s have noted that the dates of recorded star wars often coincide with astronomical events involving the planet [[Venus]], either when it was first visible in the morning or night sky or during its absence at [[inferior conjunction]]. Venus was known to [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations as the bringer of war (in contrast to the equivalent European belief assigning that characteristic to [[Mars]]). The Maya called it ''Chak Ek''' or "Great Star" and made it the focus of detailed astronomical observation and calculation. The [[Dresden Codex]], one of only four surviving [[Maya codices|Maya books]], includes astronomical tables for calculating the position of Venus, which the codex depicts as spearing people as it passes overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin, Simon|authorlink=Simon Martin (Mayanist)|author2=[[Nikolai Grube]]|year=2008|title=Chronicle of the Maya Kings and Queens: Deciphering the Dynasties of the Ancient Maya|location=London and New York|publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]]|edition=2nd|isbn=9780500287262|oclc=191753193|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventy percent of recorded star war dates are reported to correspond with [[Phases of Venus|Venus's evening phase]], while 84 percent match the first appearance of the evening star.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Star wars also appear to have had a seasonal bias, clustering in the dry season from November through January. Few were recorded to have happened during the planting season and none at all during harvest time, between mid-September and late October.&lt;ref name="Milbrath1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Milbrath|first=Susan|title=Star Gods of the Maya: Astronomy in Art, Folklore, and Calendars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUL3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|year=1999|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=978-0-292-75226-9|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may also have been a correlation between star wars and [[solar eclipse]]s; some star wars at [[Tikal]] seem to have taken place shortly after eclipses, in one case in July 743 only one day after a solar eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise nature of the proposed link between star wars and astronomical events is unclear. It is possible that events such as eclipses may have stimulated star wars, prompting the Maya to launch star wars in the belief that they had received a favorable omen for military endeavors. They may also have had astronomical connections with planets other than Venus; many star wars appear to be correlated with the [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde period]]s of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.&lt;ref name="Milbrath1999" /&gt;

==Recorded star wars==

A number of star wars are recorded in Mayan inscriptions dating from between 562 and 781.&lt;ref name="D. and A. Chase 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rice2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Prudence M.|editor1=Sabloff, Jeremy A.|editor2=Fash, William Leonard|title=Gordon R.

While there, Yeremyan also taught Armenian history at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]]'s department of History and Philology and he defended his dissertation, titled "The Feudal Organization of [[Kartli]] during the [[Marzpan]]ate Period."&lt;ref name= "PBH"/&gt;

In 1941, he moved back to Yerevan and continued his studies at the Institute of Material Culture and History, which was still under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; He earned the title of professor in 1953, having defended his second  dissertation (from [[Moscow State University]]) in his "The Social Structure of Ancient Armenia."&lt;ref name= "PBH"/&gt; He held the position of director of the department of history from 1953 to 1958 and in 1963  he was inducted as a member of the [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]].

===Academic research===
It was during this time that Yeremyan shifted his focus to composing historical atlases: one of his most notable contributions was on the study of a seventh-century "Ashkharatsuyts", where he spent a great deal of his energies in not only translating and researching the background behind the atlas but also on the supposed author of the work, [[Anania Shirakatsi]].&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; In 1963, his ''Armenia According to the Ashkharatsuyts'' was published, although Yeremyan would in subsequent years go on to revise some of the views, most notably coming to the conclusion that [[Anania Shirakatsi]] was its true author, that he had concluded in the work. He also contributed in writing several articles in the ''USSR Historical Atlas''. Yeremyan was also one of the key advocates who pushed for the publication of the ''History of the Armenian People'' (Yerevan, 1971–1984, 8 volumes), authoring numerous articles on the origins of the Armenian people, the kingdom of [[Urartu]], and on the social, economic, cultural and political structure of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]].&lt;ref name= "PBH"/&gt; He would also go on to write numerous articles in the [[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]].

Having struggled with a serious illness for many years, Yeremyan died in 1992.&lt;ref name= "PBH"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7242">'''The Earl of Sussex's Men''' was a [[playing company]] or troupe of actors in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] England, most notable for their connection with the early career of [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564&amp;ndash;1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 480-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC right}}

==First phase==
[[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex]] was one of the most powerful aristocrats during the middle years of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth's]] reign; he was named [[Lord Chamberlain]] in 1572. Like other prominent noblemen of the period, he kept a troupe of players among his retainers. The limited records of the era reveal the existence of such troupes of actors, like [[Leicester's Men]], [[Pembroke's Men]], or [[Worcester's Men]], mainly in the documents of the cities they visited during their tours of the country; similarly, Sussex's Men enter the historical record when they performed in [[Nottingham]] in March 1569. From then through the 1570s they also played in [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]], [[Ipswich]], [[Canterbury]], [[Dover]], [[Bristol]], and other towns; the troupe had six members during this era. Since their patron was serving as Lord Chamberlain, they were sometimes called the Lord Chamberlain's Men &amp;mdash; though they should not be confused with the more famous [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] of the 1590s, the company of Shakespeare and [[Richard Burbage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|E. K. Chambers]], ''The Elizabethan Stage,'' 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 2, pp. 92-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their patron's status, it is not surprising that Sussex's Men played at Court several times in this period, most often during the Christmas holidays. Their repertory consisted of anonymous and now-lost plays that are known only by their titles: ''The Red Knight'', ''The Cruelty of a Stepmother'', and ''Murderous Michael'' are three examples. The company acted ''The Cynocephali'' ("Dog-heads") at Court on 2 February [[1577 in literature|1577]]. John Adams was apparently the leader of the troupe (he received their fees for them); [[Richard Tarlton]] began his career with Sussex's Men in these years, before going to [[Queen Elizabeth's Men]] in [[1583 in literature|1583]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott McMillin and Sally-Beth MacLean, ''The Queen's Men and Their Plays,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1998; pp. 5, 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1583 the 3rd Earl of Sussex died childless, and was succeeded by his younger brother [[Henry Radcliffe, 4th Earl of Sussex|Henry Radclyffe]] as 4th Earl. During the ten years he held the earldom, Sussex's Men are known primarily through their provincial tours. In 1590 and 1591 they formed a temporary alliance with Queen Elizabeth's Men, formerly the leading company of the time but then in decline.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 93-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The early 1590s==
Sussex's Men ended a near-decade absence from Court with a performance there on 2 January [[1592 in literature|1592]]. At around this time they may have been connected with [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Thomas Kyd]], though specific details have not survived.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 94; Halliday, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the winter of 1593&amp;ndash;94, during an especially difficult epidemic of [[bubonic plague]], that Sussex's Men achieved their greatest prominence and importance. Because of the plague, the London theatres were closed almost continuously for two years, from the summer of 1592 to the spring of 1594; during the cold months of winter, however, the plague tended to abate, and theatrical manager and promoter [[Philip Henslowe]] was able to open his [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] for truncated winter seasons in both years.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Chillington Rutter, ''Documents of the Rose Playhouse,'' Manchester, Manchester University Press, 1999; pp. 14-15, 19-20 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1592&amp;ndash;93, [[Lord Strange's Men]] were at the Rose; but the next year that company was touring the countryside, and Henslowe brought in Sussex's Men for a season running from December 26, [[1593 in literature|1593]] to February 6, [[1594 in literature|1594]]. (Whether the death of the 4th Earl of Sussex in 1593, and the succession of his son [[Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex|Robert Radclyffe]] as 5th Earl, was significant in this is not known.)

Usually, the acting companies of the period owned their own plays, which they purchased outright from playwrights; Henslowe was unusual in that he owned some plays personally, and the acting troupes who worked with (or for) him could act those plays. In this way, Sussex's Men performed Marlowe's ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'' on February 4, 1594 &amp;mdash; a play that has previously been in the repertory of [[Lord Strange's Men]]. In their six-week winter season at the Rose, Sussex's  Men performed 30 times, giving 13 different plays at least once. Again, their repertory consisted mostly of anonymous and now-lost plays, like ''Richard the Confessor'', ''King Lud'', ''Abraham and Lot'', and ''The Fair Maid of Italy'' &amp;mdash; though they also performed the extant ''George a Greene'' (published 1599) four times.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 408; Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shakespeare==
The crucial item in their Rose repertory was the play that Henslowe's Diary consistently calls ''Titus &amp; Ondronicus'', which Sussex's Men played three times, on January 23 and 28 and February 6, 1594. The play was popular, and produced high profits for Henslowe, of 40 shillings or more at each performance. Scholars unanimously recognize this as Shakespeare's ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''. When Shakespeare's ''Titus'' was first published in 1594, the title page of the [[first quarto]] states that the play was acted by three different companies, Lord Strange's Men (also called Derby's Men), Pembroke's Men, and Sussex's Men. Lord Strange's Men had acted a ''Titus &amp; Vespacian'' in 1592; scholars debate the relationship between the two ''Titus'' plays, though since the earlier work is no longer extant the relationship cannot be fully or finally ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 496-7; Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 122-3, 129-30, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; (Our English version of the play has no character named Vespasian, and this could have been a play about the father-and-son Roman emperors [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]].  However, a German version of ''Titus Andronicus'' made in Shakespeare's time included a major character named Vespasian, which could indicate a lost earlier version which was taken into Germany.)

==Decline==
In the spring of 1594, the plague abated and the London theatres opened for a sustained period. Sussex's Men teamed with Queen Elizabeth's Men for two joint performances of [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]]'s ''[[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]]'' in early April; but after that, Sussex's Men disappeared from the London theatre scene. Perhaps they were squeezed out by more formidable competition from the re-organized [[Admiral's Men]] and [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]]. They returned to touring and playing the provinces, where they are known as late as 1618.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Old Straight Track: Its Mounds, Beacons, Moats, Sites and Mark Stones''''' is a book by [[Alfred Watkins]], first published in 1925, describing the existence of alleged [[ley lines]] in Britain.&lt;ref name=Belanger&gt;[http://www.ghostvillage.com/legends/2003/legends33_12132003.shtml Ley Lines, Old Straight Tracks, and Earth Energies by Jeff Belanger]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==
Watkins presents a methodical and thorough exposition of his theories of ley lines, following an earlier much shorter publication, "Early British Trackways" (1922).  The book has a preface, thirty chapters, four appendices and an index. There are many figures, and photographs taken by the author.

The book is considered the first book written about leys, and the first book to document and map alleged ley lines in Britain, primarily southern England.

The book was disregarded by archaeologists but saw a resurgence of interest with the rise of [[New Age]] ideas in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Merlin|last=Coverley|title=Psychogeography|location=Harpenden|publisher=Pocket Essentials|year=2010|page=52|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watkins' ideas also influenced contemporary [[psychogeography]], including [[Iain Sinclair]]'s ''Lud Heat'' (1975), which in turn influenced [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s novel ''[[Hawksmoor (novel)|Hawksmoor]]'' (1985).{{sfn|Coverley|2010|p=53}}

==Criticism==
Watkins' work met with early scepticism from archaeologists, one of whom, [[O. G. S. Crawford]], refused to accept advertisements for ''The Old Straight Track'' in the journal ''Antiquity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shoesmith, R. |date=1990|title=Alfred Watkins: a Herefordshire Man|page= 132|location= Woonton Almeley|publisher= Logaston Press|isbn= 0-9510242-7-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One criticism of Watkins' ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and other parts of Europe, finding straight lines that "connect" sites is trivial and ascribable to [[coincidence]]. A statistical analysis of lines concluded: "the density of archaeological sites in the British landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will 'clip' a number of sites." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Matthew|title=Archaeological Theory: An Introduction|date=29 Dec 2009|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-0015-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYHwXdNVxzMC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22ley+lines%22+density#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ley%20lines%22%20density&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 May 2011|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reprints==
The book was reprinted as {{ISBN|0-349-13707-2}} on April 2, 1994 by "Abacus". Editions or reprints were published in 1925, 1933, 1945, 1948, 1970, 1974 and 1994. The Abacus edition of 1970 was reprinted up to 1999 at least, and carries a copyright dated 1970 "Allen Watkins and Marion Watkins".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8174">:''Not to be confused with the [[Titus Labienus]] who was Julius Caesar's legate.''
'''Titus Labienus''' was an orator and historian in the time of Augustus, nicknamed Rabienus for his vigorous style. He killed himself when the Senate had his books burned. Caligula later overrode the Senate and had the books restored.

== Life ==
Little is known about his early life.  He did not come from aristocracy or the influential Roman family Labieni.&lt;ref name = "Cramer"/&gt; Instead, he grew up poor and unpopular.&lt;ref name = "Cramer"/&gt;

Although in his youth Titus Labienus Rabienus was considered unimportant, as an adult he garnered fame for his works as an historian and orator&lt;ref name="Horn"/&gt;   and has come to be regarded as one of the most instrumental and important historians of all time.  At the time, Rome was a new monarchy, Augustus had assumed power, and there was a lot of animosity in the air between the people who were for and those who were against the monarchy that had taken over the Roman Empire.  Continuously, people would go throughout the city of Rome and either publicly state or publish pamphlets with negative comments and accusations about the new emperor and monarchy.  Titus Labienus Rabienus eagerly joined the cause against the new monarchy, "flailing Augustan order"&lt;ref name = "Cramer"/&gt; and vigorously supported [[Pompey the Great]] (106 BC to 46 BC), a statesman and general of the late Roman Republic and opponent of Julius Caesar for forming the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;“Pompey the Great,” Britannica Online, Encyclopædia Britannica, Sacred Heart Schools, Lucas Family Library, Atherton, CA, 29 Nov. 2008 &lt;http://school.eb.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a historian, Titus Labienus would viciously attack the different classes of Roman society thus eventually leading to his nickname Rabienus or “rabid one”, for his "furious invective".&lt;ref name="Horn"&gt;Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, “Labienus, Titus,” Def. 2, The Oxford Classical Dictionary, (New York: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; His writings were full of such controversial material that when he recited his works in public, he would have to pass over sections that were too discordant.&lt;ref name = "Fantham"/&gt; Instead, he would allude to the missing information by saying that they were to be read after his death.&lt;ref name = "Fantham"&gt;Elaine Fantham, Roman Literary Culture: From Cicero to Apuleius, (New York: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999) 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Titus Labienus Rabienus was also recognized throughout Rome as an important member of the academic profession or “manus orator”.&lt;ref name = "Cramer"/&gt;

As time progressed the amount of pamphlets swirling about Rome began to grow and the Emperor Augustus began to put into place stricter regulations on writing, initially punishing any writers who attacked anyone (particularly himself) then moving to censor writings themselves.&lt;ref name = "Cramer"/&gt;

As both an author and a professor, both changes to Roman law further angered Titus Labienus Rabienus.  As an author he wanted the freedom to write what he wanted to write, not what the government wanted or would allow.  And as a professor, he wanted to be able to teach the truth, not just what the Roman government wanted people to know.  In general, the loss of freedom of speech aggravated Titus Labienus Rabienus to voice his disapproval even more of the new monarchy.  As even more time progressed, Augustus became even stricter until he finally created a new type of punishment for this “new crime” of voicing one’s opinion.  With this new type of punishment, depending on how guilty one was or how serious the crime one committed against the state was, either one or all of one’s life works were to be burned at the stake.&lt;ref name = "Cramer"/&gt; When the new law was first declared, even members of the Senate thought that was “an unusual way of inflicting punishment upon scholarship.”&lt;ref name = "Cramer"/&gt;

It was the professors, like Titus Labienus Rabienus, who began to feel the effects of the new law first because it was also illegal to even own, carry, or read any of the restricted material that was to be burned at the stake. His conflict with the government eventually led to his own trial (6 to 8 AD), the first of its kind, where the senate found him guilty&lt;ref name = "Cramer"/&gt; of harming the state and literary treason and as the law stated, his life works were sentenced to the stake.&lt;ref name = "Cramer"/&gt;

== Death ==

Upon hearing the verdict that he was guilty of literary treason and that his entire library was sentenced to flames, Titus Labienus Rabienus decided to kill himself.  He went to the mausoleum of his ancestors, walled himself up, and committed suicide, becoming the first Roman martyr.&lt;ref name = "Cramer"/&gt;   He refused his friends offers to cremate his body for he was not going to let the fiery element that had devoured his works touch him.&lt;ref name = "Cramer"/&gt;  Through his death, he was able to send a message about censorship to both Augustus, the emperor of Rome, and to Roman citizens.

== Overall Significance ==
By becoming the first Roman martyr and dying in such a dramatic fashion, Titus was able to bring attention to his cause and therefore rally more support.  He had the academic world upset because he made them realize the tragic implications of having everything censored by the government.  He made them think about all of the other classic writers who if they had been alive during this would have also had their works burned.   He caused classrooms to discuss and debate the implications of his trial.  He even got his enemy, [[Cassius Severus]], to commit suicide declaring that if they wanted to destroy the works of Titus Labienus Rabienus, they would have to burn him alive as well because he knew them by heart.&lt;ref name = "Barr"/&gt; By having two of the best writers of time commit suicide, even more people began to take notice.

Two emperors later, [[Caligula]] began reversing some of the damage Augustus caused when he was in power.  He permitted the works of Titus Labienus Rabienus, along with a couple other authors’ works (including Cassius Severus), to be hunted down and read again, claiming that it was in his own best interest to have all events recorded for future reference.&lt;ref name = "Barr"&gt;Anthony A. Barrett, Caligula: The Corruption of Power, (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1990) 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although, at the time of his death, he thought the damage of the flames was irreversible and that all of his life works were gone, many of his friends and fellow scholars risked their lives to save his works.  Because of the risks they took, fifty years later his works were listed as standard classroom material by [[Quintilian]].&lt;ref name = "Cramer"&gt;Frederick H.

The '''Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet''' is a school of [[classical ballet]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Established in 1738 during the reign of [[Anna of Russia|Empress Anna]], the academy was known as the '''Imperial Ballet School''' up until [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, when, after a brief hiatus, the school was re-established as the '''Leningrad State Choreographic Institute'''. In 1957, the school was renamed in honor of the renowned pedagogue [[Agrippina Vaganova]], who cultivated the method of classical ballet training that has been taught there since the late 1920s.  Graduates of the school include some of the most famous ballet dancers, choreographers and teachers in history and many of the world's leading ballet schools have adopted elements of the [[Vaganova method]] into their own training.

The Vaganova Academy is the associate school of the [[Mariinsky Ballet]], one of the world's leading ballet companies. Students of the school have found employment with ballet and contemporary companies worldwide, such as the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], [[The Royal Ballet]], [[American Ballet Theatre]] and the [[Mikhailovsky Theatre|Mikhailovsky Ballet]].

==History==
The school was established as the Imperial Theatrical School by decree of the Empress Anna on 4 May 1738 with the French [[Ballet Master]] Jean-Baptiste Lande as its director. The first classes occupied empty rooms in the [[Winter Palace]] in St. Petersburg and the first students were twelve boys and twelve girls.  The purpose of the school was to form Russia's first professional dance company, which led to the formation of the Imperial Russian Ballet, the school becoming known as the Imperial Ballet School.  The Imperial Russian Ballet is the direct predecessor of today's Mariinsky Ballet.

Nearly all the early teachers at the school were from Western Europe, including Franz Hilferding and Giovanni Canzianni. The first Russian teacher to join the school was Ivan Valberg.  After the spread of ballet in Europe, the development of the school was influenced by a number of other teachers and methods, including Christian Johannson, a student of [[August Bournonville]], and the Italian methods of [[Enrico Cecchetti]], [[Pierina Legnani]] and [[Carlotta Brianza]].  Other renowned 19th-century dancers and ballet masters who taught at and were influential in the development in the school include [[Charles Didelot]], [[Jules Perrot]], [[Arthur Saint-Léon]], [[Lev Ivanov]], [[Marius Petipa]] and [[Mikhail Fokine]].

Since 1836, the school has been situated at [[2 Rossi Street]] in St. Petersburg, which was renamed Leningrad after [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s death in 1924.  The Imperial Ballet School was dissolved by the new Soviet government, but later re-established on the same site as the Leningrad State Choreographic School.  The Imperial Russian Ballet was also dissolved and re-established as the Soviet Ballet.  The company was later renamed the [[Kirov Ballet]] following the assassination of [[Sergey Kirov]] in 1938.  Despite later being given the current name Mariinsky Ballet, the company is still commonly known as the Kirov Ballet by the majority of Western audiences and the company still use that title when touring internationally.

==Vaganova==
{{main|Agrippina Vaganova|Vaganova method}}
[[File:VaganovaEntrywayMediumMay2009.jpeg|thumb|right|165px|Medium close-up of the main entryway.]]
Agrippina Vaganova brought perhaps the most important developments in modern Russian Ballet.  She graduated from the Imperial Ballet School in 1897 and danced with the Imperial Ballet, retiring from the stage early to pursue her teaching career following the Revolution.  As the Soviet government had not yet re-established the school, Vaganova began her teaching career at the privately owned School of Russian Ballet, eventually joining the new Leningrad State Choreographic School in 1920.  Vaganova was to become a highly renowned ballet teacher and is most noted for authoring ''The Principles of Classical Dance'', which outlines the training system she created and which heads the list of the numerous works produced by teachers of the school.

Vaganova's students would become some of the most famous ballet dancers of all time, and in recognition of her achievements, the school was named in her honour in 1957, six years after her death.  There are a number of variations in the name of the school, but the official title in current use in the English-speaking world is Vaganova Ballet Academy.

==Today==

===Overview===
The Vaganova academy which some consider the source of modern ballet is now over 275 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancemagazine.com/blogs/wendy/5266 Russian Ballet Celebrates 275 (!!!) Years] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313223239/http://www.dancemagazine.com/blogs/wendy/5266 |date=2014-03-13 }}, Dance Magazine, 2013, retrieved 13 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy has over 300 students.  As in other similar institutions, competition for a place at the school is very fierce, with over 3,000 children auditioning each year, 300 of these being from St. Petersburg.  Approximately 60 students are selected annually, with some 25 eventually graduating from the school having completed the full course of training.  The school employs approximately 75 dance teachers, 30 piano teachers, 40 academic teachers and 40 accompanists.  The Rector of the academy is [[Nikolay Tsiskaridze]] and the Artistic Director is  [[Zhanna Ayupova]].

===Auditions===
Auditions for the school begin in June, and children must be at least 11 years to up.

The audition process is divided into three sections.
* Aptitude: to assess the candidate's proportions, height of jump, degree of turnout and general appearance etc.
* Physical: an examination by a specialist medical practitioner to assess the physiological possibilities of the candidate
* Artistic: to assess the candidate's musicality, rhythm, co-ordination and artistic talent

===Training===
All students at the school begin by studying a programme of dance training, secondary school level education, French language and piano lessons.  As they progress through the school, the programme becomes more intensive, with new subjects being added to the curriculum as the students become more advanced.  In the first year, students study classical and historical dance progressing to character dance in the fourth year and pas de deux and mime in the sixth year.  At the end of the 8th year of training, all students dance in a graduation gala at the Mariinsky Theatre.  The most successful students may be offered a contract with the Mariinsky Ballet company, with the majority seeking employment with ballet companies in Russia and worldwide, including leading companies such as the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], [[The Royal Ballet]], and the [[American Ballet Theatre]].
