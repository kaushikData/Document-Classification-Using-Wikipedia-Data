'''{{mp|2017 TD|6}}''' is a micro-[[asteroid]], classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately 10–20 meters in diameter. It was first observed by [[Pan-STARRS]] at [[Haleakala Observatory]], Hawaii, on 11 October 2017.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

On 19 October 2017, the asteroid transited Earth at a nominal distance of {{convert |0.001278 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=on |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}, which corresponds to 0.5 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]]s (LD). On the following day it also passed near the [[Moon]] at {{convert |0.00075575 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; Peaking near a [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] of 18, the object was too faint to be seen—except for the largest telescopes.&lt;ref name="Space.com" /&gt;

As of 2018, {{mp|2017 TD|6}} has a poorly determined orbit with an [[Uncertainty parameter|uncertainty]] of 6 and a short [[observation arc]] of 8 days only. Due to its small size, the asteroid is likely to remain unobserved until its next, still relatively distant approach, predicted to occur in March 2044, at a distance of {{convert |0.01358 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}} or 5.3&amp;nbsp;LD from Earth.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

'''Anastasios Tsonis''' is an American atmospheric scientist and distinguished professor at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]].

==Education==
Tsonis was born in the Greek city of [[Elefsis]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;[https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/aatsonis/www/# About Page], uwm.edu&lt;/ref&gt; He received his BS from [[Aristotelian University]] in 1976 and his PhD from [[McGill University]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/letsci/math/people/faculty/tsonis.cfm |title=Anastasios Tsonis |work=University of Wisconsin Milwaukee Website |accessdate=10 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015142407/http://www4.uwm.edu/letsci/math/people/faculty/tsonis.cfm |archivedate=15 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
After receiving his PhD, Tsonis became a postdoctoral fellow at the [[Atmospheric Environmental Service]] in Canada from 1982–1985. He then joined the University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Milwaukee, where he has remained ever since.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Research==
Tsonis's career began focusing on mathematical models of atmospheric processes, such as vertical wind speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The weather attractor over very short timescales | author=Tsonis, Anastasios | journal=Nature | date=June 1988 | volume=333 | issue=6173 | pages=545–547 | doi=10.1038/333545a0 | bibcode=1988Natur.333..545T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-06-29/news/8801110401_1_atmospheric-scientist-chaos-theory-edward-lorenz | title=A Calculated Guess On Weather | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=29 June 1988 | accessdate=10 October 2014 | author=Irion, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Tsonis has become known for his research pertaining to [[global warming]], especially natural influences on global temperatures. In 2009, Tsonis, with Kyle Swanson, published a paper reporting that natural climate shifts are superimposed on the warming trend observed during the 20th century. They concluded that "a break in the global mean temperature trend from the consistent warming over the 1976/77–2001/02 period may have occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swanson|first1=Kyle L.|last2=Tsonis|first2=Anastasios A.|title=Has the climate recently shifted?|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=31 March 2009|volume=36|issue=6|doi=10.1029/2008GL037022|bibcode=2009GeoRL..36.6711S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also argued that "there are times when different types of natural variation in the climate synchronize, which shifts the climate to a new state",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=288ba340-98f9-4fbe-8412-acf920b32604 |title=From chaos, coherence |work=National Post |accessdate=16 October 2014 |author=Solomon, Lawrence }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that this may explain the supposed cessation of warming that, according to him, began in 2001 or 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/29/climate-science-2009 | title=Roundup: Climate science in 2009 | work=The Guardian | date=29 December 2009 | accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contend that this shift changed the climate state from "warming" to "cooling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/269336 | title=Climate Change - Who's Fault? Or No-Fault? | work=Digital Journal | date=17 March 2009 | accessdate=10 October 2014 | author=Swaffar, Gar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsonis has argued that natural factors, especially ocean currents, may contribute more to climate change than human activity, and that the Earth is "now in a period of cooling that could last up to fifty years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.maciverinstitute.com/2010/01/uw-milwaukee-professor-predicts-50-years-of-global-cooling/ | title=UW-Milwaukee Professor Predicts 50 Years of Global Cooling | work=MacIver Institute | date=13 January 2010 | accessdate=10 October 2014 | quote=Tsonis published a paper last March that found the world goes through periods of warming and cooling that tend to last thirty years. In contrast to the vast majority of climate scientists, he says we are now in a period of cooling that could last up to fifty years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he reiterated his view that this cooling trend was occurring, and might continue for the next 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/10294082/Global-warming-No-actually-were-cooling-claim-scientists.html | title=Global warming? No, actually we're cooling, claim scientists | work=The Telegraph | date=8 September 2013 | accessdate=10 October 2014 | author=Dixon, Hayley}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, shortly after the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] was released, he also criticized the reliability of climate models, saying that they "don't agree with each other – and they don't agree with reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/09/30/un-climate-change-models-warming/ | title=UN's massive new climate report adds little explanation for 'pause' in warming | work=Fox News | date=30 September 2013 | accessdate=10 October 2014 | author=Roberts, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arctic methane release''' is the release of [[methane]] from seas and soils in [[permafrost]] regions of the [[Arctic]].  While a long-term natural process, it is exacerbated by [[global warming]]. This results in a [[positive feedback]] effect, as [[methane]] is itself a powerful [[greenhouse gas]].

The Arctic region is one of the many natural sources of the greenhouse gas methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1175176 | title = Large-Scale Controls of Methanogenesis Inferred from Methane and Gravity Spaceborne Data | year = 2010 | last1 = Bloom | first1 = A.

==Contribution to climate change==

The release of methane from the Arctic is in itself a major contributor to [[global warming]] as a result of [[polar amplification]]. Recent observations in the [[Siberian]] arctic show increased rates of methane release from the Arctic seabed.&lt;ref name=shakhova2005 /&gt; Land-based permafrost, also in the Siberian arctic, was estimated in 2013 to release 17 million tonnes of methane per year – a significant increase on the 3.8 million tons estimated in 2006, and estimates before then of just 0.5 million tonnes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Twice as Much Methane Escaping Arctic Seafloor|url = http://www.livescience.com/41476-more-arctic-seafloor-methane-found.html|accessdate = 2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1038/nature05040|date=Sep 2006| author=Walter, Km| author2=Zimov, Sa| author3=Chanton, Jp| author4=Verbyla, D| author5=Chapin, Fs 3Rd| title=Methane bubbling from Siberian thaw lakes as a positive feedback to climate warming| volume=443| issue=7107| pages=71–5| issn=0028-0836| pmid=16957728| journal=Nature| bibcode=2006Natur.443...71W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shakhova N. |author2=Semiletov I. |author3=Salyuk A. |author4=Kosmach D. |author5=Bel'cheva N. | year = 2007 | title = Methane release on the Arctic East Siberian shelf | url = http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2007/01071/EGU2007-J-01071.pdf?PHPSESSID=e | journal = [[Geophysical Research Abstracts]] | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 01071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to around 500 million tonnes released into the atmosphere annually from all sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Shakhova et al. (2008) estimate that not less than 1,400 [[gigatonne]]s (Gt) of [[carbon]] is presently locked up as methane and methane hydrates under the Arctic submarine permafrost, and 5–10% of that area is subject to puncturing by open [[talik]]s. They conclude that "release of up to 50 Gt of predicted amount of hydrate storage [is] highly possible for abrupt release at any time". That would increase the methane content of the planet's atmosphere by a factor of twelve.&lt;ref&gt;N. Shakhova, I. Semiletov, A. Salyuk, D.

Study findings based on NASA's CARVE mission concluded in 2015, that methane emissions in the Arctic during the cold season are higher than previously thought. The press release by JPL explained:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4804|title=Methane Emissions in Arctic Cold Season Higher Than Expected|year=2015|publisher=JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The water trapped in the soil doesn't freeze completely even below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius). The top layer of the ground, known as the active layer, thaws in the summer and refreezes in the winter, and it experiences a kind of sandwiching effect as it freezes. When temperatures are right around 32 degrees Fahrenheit – the so-called "zero curtain" – the top and bottom of the active layer begin to freeze, while the middle remains insulated. Microorganisms in this unfrozen middle layer continue to break down organic matter and emit methane many months into the Arctic's cold period each year.}}

Hong et al. (2017) studied the seepage from large mounds of hydrates in the shallow arctic seas at Storfjordrenna, in the Barents Sea close to Svalbard. They showed that though the temperature of the sea bed has fluctuated seasonally over the last century, between 1.8 and 4.8&amp;nbsp;°C, it has only affected release of methane to a depth of about 1.6 meters. Hydrates can be stable through the top 60 meters of the sediments and the current rapid releases came from deeper below the sea floor. They concluded that the increase in flux started hundreds to thousands of years ago well before the onset of warming that others speculated as its cause, and that these seepages are not increasing due to momentary warming.&lt;ref&gt;Hong, Wei-Li, et al. [https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15745 "Seepage from an arctic shallow marine gas hydrate reservoir is insensitive to momentary ocean warming."] Nature Communications 8 (2017): 15745.&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing his research, Hong stated:
{{quote|"The results of our study indicate that the immense seeping found in this area is a result of natural state of the system. Understanding how methane interacts with other important geological, chemical and biological processes in the Earth system is essential and should be the emphasis of our scientific community,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CAGE|title=Study finds hydrate gun hypothesis unlikely|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-08-hydrate-gun-hypothesis.html|publisher=Phys.org|date=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Further research by Klaus Wallmann et al. (2018) found that the hydrate release is due to the rebound of the sea bed after the ice melted. The methane dissociation began around 8,000 years ago when the land began to rise faster than the sea level, and the water as a result started to get shallower with less hydrostatic pressure. This dissociation therefore was a result of the uplift of the sea bed rather than anthropogenic warming. The amount of methane released by the hydrate dissociation was small. They found that the methane seeps originate not from the hydrates but from deep geological gas reservoirs (seepage from these formed the hydrates originally). They concluded that the hydrates acted as a dynamic seal regulating the methane emissions from the deep geological gas reservoirs and when they were dissociated 8,000 years ago, weakening the seal, this led to the higher methane release still observed today.&lt;ref&gt;Wallmann, K., Riedel, M., Hong, W.L., Patton, H., Hubbard, A., Pape, T., Hsu, C.W., Schmidt, C., Johnson, J.E., Torres, M.E. and Andreassen, K., 2018. Gas hydrate dissociation off Svalbard induced by isostatic rebound rather than global warming. Nature Communications, 9(1), p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arctic sea ice===
{{Main|Arctic sea ice decline}}
A 2015 study concluded that Arctic sea ice decline accelerates methane emissions from the Arctic tundra. One of the study researchers noted, "The expectation is that with further sea ice decline, temperatures in the Arctic will continue to rise, and so will [[atmospheric methane|methane]] emissions from northern wetlands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150917091306.htm|publisher=ScienceDaily|year=2015|title=Melting Arctic sea ice accelerates methane emissions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ice sheets===
A 2014 study found evidence for methane cycling below the ice sheet of the [[Russell Glacier (Greenland)|Russell Glacier]], based on subglacial drainage samples which were dominated by [[Proteobacteria]]. During the study, the most widespread surface melt on record for the past 120 years was observed in Greenland; on 12 July 2012, unfrozen water was present on almost the entire ice sheet surface (98.6%). The findings indicate that [[methanotrophs]] could serve as a biological methane sink in the subglacial ecosystem, and the region was, at least during the sample time, a source of [[atmospheric methane]]. Scaled dissolved methane flux during the 4 months of the summer melt season was estimated at 990 Mg CH4. Because the Russell-Leverett Glacier is representative of similar Greenland outlet glaciers, the researchers concluded that the Greenland Ice Sheet may represent a significant global methane source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molecular and biogeochemical evidence for methane cycling beneath the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet|year=2014|author=Markus Dieser|author2=Erik L J E Broemsen |author3=Karen A Cameron|author4=Gary M King|author5=Amanda Achberger|author6=Kyla Choquette|author7=Birgit Hagedorn|author8=Ron Sletten|author9=Karen Junge |author10=Brent C Christner |last-author-amp=yes|url=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v8/n11/full/ismej201459a.html|journal=The ISME Journal |volume=8 |issue=11|doi=10.1038/ismej.2014.59 |pages=2305–2316|pmc=4992074}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2016 concluded that [[methane clathrate]]s may exist below Greenland's and Antarctica's ice sheets, based on past evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160107/ncomms10314/full/ncomms10314.html|title=Ice-sheet-driven methane storage and release in the Arctic |year=2016 |journal=Nature Communications |volume=7 |pages=10314 |author=Alexey Portnov|author2=Sunil Vadakkepuliyambatta|author3=Jürgen Mienert |author4=Alun Hubbard |last-author-amp=yes |doi=10.1038/ncomms10314 |pmid=26739497 |pmc=4729839 |bibcode=2016NatCo...710314P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another possible mechanism for rapid methane release.  As the Arctic Ocean becomes more and more ice free, the ocean absorbs more of the incident energy from the sun. The Arctic Ocean becomes warmer than the former ice cover and much more water vapour enters the air.  At times when the adjacent land is colder than the sea, this causes rising air above the sea and an off-shore wind as air over the land comes in to replace the rising air over the sea.  As the air rises, the [[dew point]] is reached and clouds form, releasing latent heat and further reinforcing the buoyancy of the air over the ocean.  All this results in air being drawn from the south across the tundra rather than the present situation of cold air flowing toward the south from the cold sinking air over the Arctic Ocean.  The extra heat being drawn from the south further accelerates the warming of the permafrost and the Arctic Ocean with increased release of methane.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

[[Sinkhole]]s discovered in the [[Yamal Peninsula]] in [[Siberia]], Russia beginning in July 2014 are believed by Russian researchers to have been caused by methane released due to permafrost thawing. Near the bottom of the first sinkhole, air contained unusually high concentrations of methane, according to tests conducted by the researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/mysterious-siberian-crater-attributed-to-methane-1.15649|title=Mysterious Siberian crater attributed to methane|first=Katia|last=Moskvitch|publisher=|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15649|journal=Nature|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis points to the destabilization of gas hydrates containing huge amounts of methane gas.&lt;ref name="CAGE_2014" /&gt;

According to researchers at Norway's Centre for Arctic Gas Hydrate (CAGE), through a process called geothermal heat flux, the Siberian [[permafrost]] which extends to the seabed of the [[Kara Sea]], a section of the [[Arctic Ocean]] between the Yamal Peninsula and [[Novaya Zemlya]], is thawing. According to a CAGE researcher, Aleksei Portnov,

{{quote|"The thawing of permafrost on the ocean floor is an ongoing process, likely to be exaggerated by the global warming of the world´s oceans."|source=CAGE 2014}}

[[Methane hydrate]] is leaking in an area of at least 7500 m2. In some areas gas flares extend up to {{convert|25|meters|abbr=on}}. Prior to their research it was proposed that methane was tightly sealed into the permafrost by water depths up to {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}}. Close to the shore however, where the permafrost seal tapers to as little as {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}}, there are significant amounts of gas leakage.&lt;ref name="CAGE_2014"&gt;{{citation |url=https://cage.uit.no/news/methane-leaking-permafrost-seal-offshore-siberia/ |title=Methane is leaking from permafrost offshore Siberia |first=Maja |last=Sojtaric |publisher=Centre for Arctic Gas Hydrate (CAGE) |location=Tromsø, Norway |accessdate=28 December 2014 |date=18 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to monitoring carried out in 2003/2004 by Shakhova et al., the surface layer of shelf water in the [[East Siberian Sea]] and [[Laptev Sea]]  was supersaturated up to 2500% relative to then present average [[atmospheric methane]] content of 1.85 ppm. Anomalously high concentrations (up to 154 nM or 4400% supersaturation) of dissolved methane in the bottom layer of shelf water suggest that the bottom layer is somehow affected by near-bottom sources. Considering the possible formation mechanisms of such plumes, their studies indicated thermoabrasion and the effects of shallow gas or gas hydrates release.&lt;ref name=shakhova2005 /&gt;

Research in 2008 in the Siberian Arctic has shown [[clathrate]]-derived methane being released through perforations in the seabed permafrost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2006GL027977 |title=Origin of pingo-like features on the Beaufort Sea shelf and their possible relationship to decomposing methane gas hydrates |year=2007 |author=Paull, Charles K. |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=L01603 |last2=Ussler |first2=William |last3=Dallimore |first3=Scott R. |last4=Blasco |first4=Steve M. |last5=Lorenson |first5=Thomas D. |last6=Melling |first6=Humfrey |last7=Medioli |first7=Barbara E. |last8=Nixon |first8=F.

'''''Black Orpheus''''' ([[Brazilian Portuguese]]: ''Orfeu Negro'' {{IPA-pt|ɔɾˈfew ˈne.ɡɾu|}}) is a 1959 [[romance film|romantic]] [[tragedy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/black-orpheus-6586113|title=Black Orpheus|first=Julia|last=Youssefnia|date=19 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2002-08-16/black-orpheus-1959/|title=Black Orpheus (1959)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usccBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;q=black+orpheus+tragedy|title=Tragedy|first=Sarah|last=Dewar-Watson|date=10 June 2014|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/black-orpheus/review/|title=Black Orpheus|first=David|last=Parkinson|website=Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt; film made in Brazil by French director [[Marcel Camus]] and starring [[Marpessa Dawn]] and [[Breno Mello]]. It is based on the play ''[[Orfeu da Conceição]]'' by [[Vinicius de Moraes]], which is itself an adaptation of the [[Greek mythology|Greek legend]] of [[Orpheus and Eurydice]], set in the modern context of a ''[[favela]]'' ("slum") in [[Rio de Janeiro]] during ''[[Brazilian Carnival|Carnaval]]''. The film was an international co-production among [[production company|production companies]] in Brazil, France and Italy.

The film is particularly noted for its soundtrack by two Brazilian composers: [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]], whose song "[[A Felicidade]]" opens the film; and [[Luiz Bonfá]], whose "[[Manhã de Carnaval]]" and "Samba de Orfeu" have become classics of ''[[bossa nova]]''. The songs sung by the character Orfeu were dubbed by singer [[Agostinho dos Santos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castro|first=Ruy|title=Bossa Nova: The Story of the Brazilian Music That Seduced the World|year=1990|publisher=A Capella Books|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1-55652-494-3|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lengthy passages of the film were shot in the [[Morro da Babilônia]], a ''favela'' in the [[Leme, Rio de Janeiro|Leme]] neighbourhood of [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;Valladares, Licia. [http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/etext/llilas/vrp/valladares.pdf ''Social Science Representations of Favelas in Rio De Janeiro: A Historical Perspective''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bellos, Alex. [https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/jan/14/brazil.riodejaneiro.onlocationfilminspiredtravel?page=all "Movie palace"], ''[[The Guardian]]'' (14 January 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A marble Greek ''[[bas relief]]'' explodes to reveal [[black people|black]] men dancing the [[samba]] to drums in a ''[[favela]]''. Eurydice ([[Marpessa Dawn]]) arrives in Rio de Janeiro, and takes a [[Tram|trolley]] driven by Orfeu (Breno Mello). New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina ([[Léa Garcia]]).

Although engaged to Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring.

When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man &amp;ndash; Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume &amp;ndash; finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico (Waldemar De Souza) shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed.

Orfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a [[samba school]], one of many parading during [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]]. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her costume so that she can spend more time with her sailor. A veil conceals Eurydice's face; only Orfeu is told of the deception. During the parade, Orfeu dances with Eurydice rather than Mira.

Eventually, Mira spots Serafina among the spectators and rips off Eurydice's veil. Eurydice is forced once again to run for her life first from Mira, then from Death. Trapped in Orfeu's own trolley station, she hangs from a power line to get away from Death and is killed accidentally by Orfeu when he turns the power on and electrocutes her. Death tells Orfeu "Now she's mine," before knocking him out.

Distraught, Orfeu looks for Eurydice at the Office of Missing Persons, although Hermes has told him she is dead. The building is deserted at night, with only a janitor sweeping up. He tells Orfeu that the place holds only papers and that no people can be found there. Taking pity on Orfeu, the janitor takes him down a large darkened spiral staircase &amp;ndash; a reference to the mythical Orpheus' descent into the underworld &amp;ndash; to a [[Macumba]] ritual, a regional form of the Afro-Brazilian religion [[Candomblé]].

At the gate, there is a dog named [[Cerberus]], after the three-headed dog of [[Hades]] in Greek mythology. During the ritual, the janitor tells Orfeu to call to his beloved by singing. The spirit of Eurydice inhabits the body of an old woman and speaks to him. Orfeu wants to gaze upon her, but Eurydice begs him not to lest he lose her forever. When he turns and looks anyway, he sees the old woman, and Eurydice's spirit departs, as in the Greek myth.

Orfeu wanders in mourning. He retrieves Eurydice's body from the city morgue and carries her in his arms across town and up the hill toward his home, where his shack is burning. A vengeful Mira, running amok, flings a stone that hits him in the head and knocks him over a cliff to his death with Eurydice still in his arms.

Two children, Benedito and Zeca &amp;ndash; who have followed Orfeu throughout the film &amp;ndash; believe Orfeu's tale that his guitar playing causes the sun to rise every morning. After Orfeu's death, Benedito insists that Zeca pick up the guitar and play so that the sun will rise. Zeca plays, and the sun comes up. A little girl appears, gives Zeca a single flower, and the three children dance.

==Awards and honors==
''Black Orpheus'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1959 Cannes Film Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3471/year/1959.html |title=''Black Orpheus''|date=1959 |accessdate=15 February 2009|website=[[Festival de Cannes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1960 [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1960|title=The 32nd Academy Awards (1960) Nominees and Winners|accessdate=27 October 2011|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1960 [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Film]] and the 1961 [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Best Foreign Language Film. In the last case, Brazil was credited together with France and Italy.

==Influence==
''Black Orpheus'' was cited by [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] as one of his early musical influences,&lt;ref&gt;Fretz, Eric. ''Jean-Michael Basquiat: A Biography'', Greenwood Biographies, 2010, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Barack Obama]] notes in his [[memoir]] ''[[Dreams from My Father]]'' (1995) that it was his mother's favorite film.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Ed. [http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2008/22/barack-obama-a-story-of-race-and-politics "The House Next Door: Barack Obama: A Story of Race and Politics"], ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' (22 March 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Tia. [http://www.essence.com/2011/08/21/black-orpheus-marpessa-dawn/ "Vintage Vamp: Black Orpheus Star Marpessa Dawn"] ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'', (21 August 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama, however, did not share his mother's preferences upon first watching the film during his first years at [[Columbia University]]: "I suddenly realized that the depiction of the childlike blacks I was now seeing on the screen, the reverse image of Conrad's dark savages, was what my mother had carried with her to Hawaii all those years before, a reflection of the simple fantasies that had been forbidden to a white, middle-class girl from Kansas, the promise of another life: warm, sensual, exotic, different."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Bradshaw|Bradshaw, Peter]], [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/feb/02/barack-obama-black-orpheus "Why Obama is wrong about Black Orpheus"], ''The Guardian'', 2 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's soundtrack also inspired [[Vince Guaraldi]]'s 1962 album ''[[Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus]]''.

==Remakes and adaptations==
*In 1999, [[Carlos Diegues]] made ''[[Orfeu]]'' with a soundtrack featuring Brazilian singer-songwriter [[Caetano Veloso]]. The director said it was not a remake of ''Black Orpheus'' but a film based on Vinicius de Moraes' 1956 play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/25/movies/film-review-reborn-in-a-less-romantic-rio-orpheus-seasons-samba-with-rap.html|title=FILM REVIEW; Reborn in a Less Romantic Rio, Orpheus Seasons Samba With Rap|last=Scott|first=A.

The '''Chatham Islands''' form an [[archipelago]] in the Pacific Ocean about {{convert|800|km|round=10|abbr=out}} east of the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. It consists of about ten islands within a {{convert|40|km|adj=on}} radius, the largest of which are [[Chatham Island]] and [[Pitt Island]]. Some of these islands, once cleared for farming, are now preserved as nature reserves to [[conservation in New Zealand|conserve]] some of the unique flora and fauna.
The resident population is 600 ({{as of|2013|lc=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Census QuickStats about a place: Chatham Islands Territory|url=http://archive.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-a-place.aspx?url=/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-a-place.aspx&amp;request_value=15197&amp;tabname|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands' economy is largely dependent on conservation, tourism, farming, and fishing. 

The archipelago is called ''Rēkohu'' ("Misty Sun") in the indigenous [[Moriori language]], and ''Wharekauri'' in [[Māori language|Māori]]. The [[Moriori]] are the indigenous people of the Chatham Islands, and members of the [[Māori people|Māori]] [[Ngāti Mutunga]] tribe have also settled on the island. It has officially been part of New Zealand since 1842 and includes the country's easternmost point, the [[Forty-Fours]]. 

Local administration of the Chatham Islands is provided by the Chatham Islands Council, whose powers are similar to other [[unitary authorities]]. The islands are listed with the [[New Zealand Outlying Islands]]. The islands are an immediate part of New Zealand, but not part of any [[Regions of New Zealand|region]] or [[Territorial Authorities of New Zealand|district]], but instead ''Area Outside Territorial Authority'', like all the other outlying islands except the [[Solander Islands]].

==Geography==
{{See also|Chatham Rise}}
[[File:Chatham-Islands map topo en.svg|thumb|270px|[[Topographic map]] of the Chatham Islands]]

The islands are at about {{coord|43|53|S|176|31|W|}}, roughly {{convert|840|km|mi|-1}} east of [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]]. The nearest mainland New Zealand point to the Chatham Islands is [[Cape Turnagain]], in the [[North Island]] at a distance of {{convert|650|km|mi|-1}}. The nearest mainland city to the islands is [[Hastings, New Zealand]], located {{convert|697|km|mi|-1}} to the North-West. The two largest islands, [[Chatham Island]] and [[Pitt Island]], constitute most of the total area of {{convert|966|km2|sqmi|0}}, with a dozen scattered islets covering the rest. 

The islands sit on the [[Chatham Rise]], a large, relatively shallowly submerged (no more than {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|disp=or}} deep at any point) part of the [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]] continent that stretches east from near the South Island. The Chatham Islands, which emerged only within the last four million years, are the only part of the Chatham Rise showing above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/UnderstandingTheNaturalWorld/Ecoregions/9/en |title=Ecoregions: The Chatham Islands |accessdate=2009-02-08 |last=McGlone |first=Matt |date=21 September 2007 |work=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands are hilly with coasts being a varied mixture including cliffs and [[dune]]s, beaches, and lagoons. Pitt is more rugged than Chatham, although the highest point ({{convert|299|m|ft|disp=or}}) is on a plateau near the southernmost point of the main island (at {{coord|44|07|12|S|176|34|38|W|}}, {{convert|1.5|km|mi}} south of [[Lake Te Rangatapu]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.topomap.co.nz/NZTopoMap/ci54/Lake-Te-Rangatapu/ New Zealand topographic map of Lake Te Rangatapu area]&lt;/ref&gt; The plateau is dotted with numerous lakes and lagoons, flowing mainly from the island's nearby second highest point, [[Maungatere Hill]], at 294 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chatham Islands Conservation Management Strategy|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/about-doc/role/policies-and-plans/chatham-islands-cms.pdf|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=17 October 2017|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable are the large [[Te Whanga Lagoon]], and Huro and Rangitahi. Chatham has a number of streams, including Te Awainanga and Tuku. 

Chatham and Pitt are the only inhabited islands, with the remaining smaller islands being conservation reserves with restricted or prohibited access. The livelihoods of the inhabitants depend on agriculture, with the island being an exporter of coldwater [[Jasus edwardsii|crayfish]], and increasing tourism.

===Chathams time===
The [[International Date Line]] lies to the east of the Chathams, even though the islands lie east of 180° [[longitude]]. The Chathams observe their own time, 45 minutes ahead of [[Time in New Zealand|New Zealand time]], including during periods of [[daylight saving time]]; the [[Chatham Standard Time Zone]] is distinctive as one of very few that differ from others by a period other than a whole hour or half-hour. (New Zealand Time orients itself to 180° longitude.)

==Subdivision==
The Chatham Islands are subdivided into seven survey districts:

# Rangitihi Survey District {{coord|43|41|50|S|176|37|46|W}} (north)
# Rekohu Survey District {{coord|43|44|11|S|176|20|48|W}} (northeast)
# Tawirikoko Survey District {{coord|43|48|37|S|176|50|00|W}} (northwest)
# Te Whanga Survey District {{coord|43|49|26|S|176|32|26|W}} (center-north)
# Oropuke Survey District {{coord|44|01|28|S|176|36|53|W}} (south)
# Rangimene Survey District {{coord|44|02|28|S|176|19|58|W}} (southeast)
# Rangiuria Survey District {{coord|44|16|49|S|176|14|58|W}} (Pitt Island)

[[File:Ruffled Weka.jpg|thumb|A [[weka]] on Chatham Island]]

The natural vegetation of the islands was a mixture of forest, scrubby heath, and swamp, but today most of the land is fern or pasture-covered, although there are some areas of dense forest and areas of peat bogs and other habitats. Of interest are the [[Olearia traversiorum|akeake]] trees, with branches trailing almost horizontally in the lee of the wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rhys |last=Richards |title=Chatham Islands - Overview |work=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/photograph/37780/wind-blown-akeake |accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ferns in the forest [[understory]] include ''[[Blechnum discolor]]''.

The islands are home to a rich bio-diversity including about fifty [[endemism|endemic]] plants adapted to the cold and the wind, such as Chatham Islands forget-me-not (''[[Myosotidium|Myosotidium hortensia]]''), Chatham Islands sow-thistle ''([[Embergeria grandifolia]])'', rautini (''[[Brachyglottis huntii]]''), Chatham Islands kakaha (''[[Astelia chathamica]]''), soft speargrass (''[[Aciphylla dieffenbachii]]''), and Chatham Island akeake or Chatham Island tree daisy (''[[Olearia traversiorum]]'').

The islands are a breeding ground for huge flocks of seabirds and are home to a number of endemic birds, some of which are seabirds and others which live on the islands. The best known species are the [[magenta petrel]] (IUCN classification CR]) and the [[black robin]] (IUCN classification EN), both of which came perilously close to [[extinction]] before drawing the attention of [[bird conservation|conservation]] efforts. Other endemic species are the [[Chatham oystercatcher]], the [[Chatham gerygone]], [[Chatham pigeon]], [[Forbes' parakeet]], the [[Chatham snipe]] and the [[shore plover]].

A number of species have gone [[extinct]] since European settlement, including the three endemic species of [[Rallidae|rails]], the [[Chatham raven]], and the [[Chatham fernbird]].

Also, a number of marine mammals are found in the waters of the Chathams, including [[New Zealand sea lion]]s, [[leopard seal]]s, and [[southern elephant seal]]s. Many [[whale]] species are  attracted to the rich food sources of the [[Chatham Rise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jolly|first1=Dyanna|title=Cultural Impact Assessment Report|date=2014|publisher=Chatham Rock Phosphate|page=10|url=http://www.epa.govt.nz/eez/EEZ000006/EEZ000006_Ngai_Tahu_Marine_Mammal_Cultural_Impact_Assessment_dated_July_2014.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202071102/http://www.epa.govt.nz/eez/EEZ000006/EEZ000006_Ngai_Tahu_Marine_Mammal_Cultural_Impact_Assessment_dated_July_2014.pdf|archive-date=2 February 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the natural forest of these islands has been cleared for farming, but Mangere and Rangatira Islands are now preserved as nature reserves to conserve some of these unique flora and fauna. Another threat to wildlife comes from [[introduced species]] which prey on the indigenous birds and reptiles, whereas on Mangere and Rangatira, livestock has been removed and native wildlife is recovering.

==History==
[[File:Chatham Island Tree Carving.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Moriori people|Moriori]] tree carving, or [[dendroglyph]], found in the Chatham Islands]]

===Moriori===
{{main article|Moriori people}}
The first human inhabitants of the Chathams were [[Polynesia]]n [[tribe]]s who settled the islands about 1500 [[Common Era|CE]],&lt;ref&gt;McFadgen 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and in their isolation became the Moriori. The former belief, which arose in the 1800s, was that the original Moriori migrated directly from the more northerly Polynesian islands, just as with the settlement of New Zealand by the ancestors of the Māori. However, linguistic research indicates instead that the ancestral Moriori were Māori wanderers from New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark 1994: 123–135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis and Solomon 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howe2006"&gt;Howe 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="King"&gt;King 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
As Howe (2003) puts it,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Scholarship over the past 40 years has radically revised the model offered a century earlier by Smith: the Moriori as a pre-Polynesian people have gone (the term Moriori is now a technical term referring to those ancestral Māori who settled the Chatham Islands).'&lt;ref name="Howe2003"&gt;Kerry R. Howe (2003). ''The Quest for Origins: Who First Discovered and Settled New Zealand and the Pacific Islands?'' Auckland:Penguin, page 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The plants cultivated by the Māori arrivals were ill-suited for the colder Chathams, so the Moriori lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s and fishermen. While their new environment deprived them of the resources with which to build ocean-going craft for long voyages, the Moriori invented what was known as the [[waka korari]], a semi-submerged craft, constructed of flax and lined with air bladders from kelp. This craft was used to travel to the outer islands on 'birding' missions.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; The Moriori society was a peaceful society and bloodshed was outlawed by the chief Nunuku after generations of warfare. Arguments were solved by consensus or by [[duel]]s rather than warfare, but at the first sign of bloodshed, the  fight was over.

===European arrival===
The name "Chatham Islands" comes from the ship {{HMS|Chatham|1788|6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chatham Islands|volume=6|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Vancouver Expedition]], whose captain [[William R. Broughton]] landed on 29 November 1791, claimed possession for Great Britain and named the islands after the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham]]. A relative of his, [[Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford|Thomas Pitt]], was a member of the Vancouver Expedition. [[Seal hunting|Sealers]] and [[whaling|whalers]] soon started hunting in the surrounding ocean with the islands as their base. It is estimated that 10 to 20 percent of the indigenous Moriori soon died from diseases introduced by foreigners. The sealing and whaling industries ceased activities about 1861, while fishing remained as a major economic activity.

Chatham Islands date their anniversary on 29 November, and observe it 30 November.

===Māori Settlement===
On 19 November 1835 and later on 5 December, about 900 Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama previously resident in Te Whanganui-A-Tara (Wellington) and led by the chief Matioro arrived on the brig ''Lord Rodney''. The first mate of the ship had been 'kidnapped and threatened with death' unless the captain took the Māori settlers on board. The group, which included men, women and children, brought with them 78 tonnes of seed potato, 20 pigs and seven large canoes called ''[[waka (canoe)|waka]]''.&lt;ref name="being_Pakeha"&gt;King, M. (2004). ''Being Pakeha''. Penguin. p 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The incoming Māori were received and initially cared for by the local [[Moriori]].  Soon, Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama began to ''takahi'', or walk the land, to lay claim to it. When it became clear that the visitors intended to stay, the Moriori withdrew to their [[marae]] at te Awapatiki. There, after holding a ''hui'' (consultation) to debate what to do about the Māori settlers, the Moriori decided to stay with their policy of non-aggression. 

Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama in turn saw the meeting as a precursor to warfare on the part of Moriori and responded. The Māori attacked and in the ensuing action killed over 260 Moriori. A Moriori survivor recalled: "[The Māori] commenced to kill us like sheep... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed — men, women and children — indiscriminately." A Māori chief, Te Rakatau Katihe, said: "We took possession ... in accordance with our custom, and we caught all the people. Not one escaped. Some ran away from us, these we killed; and others also we killed — but what of that? It was in accordance with our custom." Despite the Chatham Islands being made part of New Zealand in 1842, Māori kept Moriori slaves until 1863.

After the killings, Moriori were forbidden to marry Moriori, or to have children with each other. All became slaves of the Māori until the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;''Rekohu''{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many died in despair. Many Moriori women had children by their Māori masters. A number of Moriori women eventually married either Māori or European men. Some were taken away from the Chathams and never returned. [[Ernst Dieffenbach]], who visited the Chathams on a [[New Zealand Company]] ship in 1840, reported that the Moriori were the virtual slaves of Māori and were severely mistreated, with death being a blessing. By the time the slaves were released in 1862, only 160 remained, hardly 10% of the 1835 population.&lt;ref name="being_Pakeha"/&gt;

In early May 1838 (some reports say 1839 but this is contradicted by ship records&lt;ref name="whaling-days"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Old Whaling Days |url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-McNOldW-t1-body-d1-d19-d1.html |chapter=XIX. — American Whalers and Scientists, 1838 to 1840|website=Victoria University of Wellington |first=Robert |last=McNab |year=1913|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the French whaling vessel ''Jean Bart'' anchored off Waitangi to trade with the Māori. The number of Māori boarding frightened the French, escalating into a confrontation in which the French crew were killed and the ''Jean Bart'' was run aground at Ocean Bay, to be ransacked and burned by Ngāti Mutunga. When word of the incident reached the French naval corvette ''Heroine'' in the Bay of Islands in September 1838, it set sail for the Chathams, accompanied by the whalers ''Adele'' and ''Rebecca Sims''. The French arrived on 13 October and, after unsuccessfully attempting to entice some Ngāti Tama aboard, proceeded to bombard Waitangi. The next morning about a hundred armed Frenchmen went ashore, burning buildings, destroying ''waka'', and seizing pigs and potatoes. The attacks mostly affected Ngāti Tama, weakening their position relative to Ngāti Mutunga.&lt;ref name="whaling-days"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-McNOldW-t1-body-d1-d15.html||title=The Old Whaling Days |chapter=XV. — The French Fleet, 1836 to 1838|website=Victoria University of Wellington |first=Robert |last=McNab |year=1913 |accessdate=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, Ngāti Mutunga decided to attack Ngāti Tama at their ''pa''. They built a high staging next to the ''pa'' so they could fire down on their former allies. Fighting was still in progress when the [[New Zealand Company]] ship ''[[New Zealand Company ships#Cuba|Cuba]]'' arrived as part of a scheme to buy land for settlement. The [[Treaty of Waitangi]], at that stage, did not apply to the islands. The company negotiated a truce between the two warring tribes. In 1841, the New Zealand Company had proposed to establish a German colony on the Chathams. The proposal was discussed by the directors and John Ward signed an agreement with [[Karl Sieveking]] of [[Hamburg]] on 12 September 1841. However, when the Colonial Office said that the islands were to be part of the colony of New Zealand and any Germans settling there would be treated as aliens, Joseph Somes claimed that Ward had been acting on his own initiative. The proposed leader John Beit and the expedition went to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Patricia Burns | title=Fatal Success: A History of the New Zealand Company | year= 1989 | pages=243, 244 |isbn=0-7900-0011-3 | publisher= Heinemann Reed }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was then able to purchase large areas of land at Port Hutt (which the Māori called Whangaroa) and [[Waitangi, Chatham Islands|Waitangi]] from Ngāti Mutanga and also large areas of land from Ngāti Tama. This did not stop Ngāti Mutunga from trying to get revenge for the death of one of their chiefs. They were satisfied after they killed the brother of a Ngāti Tama chief. The tribes agreed to an uneasy peace which was finally conformed in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Musket Wars. p354-356.R.Crosby. Reed. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Reluctant to give up slavery, Matioro and his people chartered a brig in late 1842 and sailed to [[Auckland Island]]. While Matioro was surveying the island, two of the chiefs who had accompanied him decided the island was too inhospitable for settlement, and set sail before he had returned, stranding him and his followers until [[Pākehā]] settlers arrived in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rykers|first=Ellen|date=July–August 2018|title=The lie of the land|url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/the-lie-of-the-land/|journal=New Zealand Geographic|volume=152|pages=92–103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An all-male group of German Lutheran missionaries arrived in the Chathams in 1843. After a group of women were sent out to join them, three years later, several marriages ensued, and many members of the present-day population can trace their ancestry back to the missionary families.

In 1865, the Māori leader [[Te Kooti]] was exiled on the Chatham Islands along with a large group of Māori rebels called the Hauhau, followers of [[Pai Mārire]] who had murdered missionaries and fought against government forces mainly on the East Coast of the [[North Island]] of New Zealand. The rebel prisoners were paid one shilling a day to work on sheep farms owned by the few European settlers. Sometimes they worked on road and track improvements. They were initially guarded by 26 guards, half of whom were Māori. They lived in ''whare'' along with their families. The prisoners helped build a redoubt of stone surrounded by a ditch and wall. Later, they built 3 stone prison cells.

===Present day conditions===
The Moriori community is organised as the Hokotehi Moriori Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hokotehi.co.nz/ ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212134226/http://www.hokotehi.co.nz/ |date=12 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moriori have received recognition from the [[The Crown|Crown]] and the New Zealand government and some of their claims against those institutions for the generations of neglect and oppression have been accepted and acted on. Moriori are recognised as the original people of Rekohu. The Crown also recognised the Ngāti Mutunga Māori&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education-resources.co.nz/early-wharekauri.htm Ngati] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323075744/http://www.education-resources.co.nz/early-wharekauri.htm |date=23 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as having indigenous status in the Chathams by right of 160-odd years of occupation.

The population of the islands is around 600, including members of both ethnic groups. In January 2005, the Moriori celebrated the opening of the new Kopinga Marae (meeting house).{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Modern descendants of the 1835 Māori conquerors claimed a share in ancestral Māori fishing rights. This claim was granted. Now that the primordial population, the Moriori, have been recognised to be former Māori—over the objections of some of the Ngāti Mutunga—they too share in the ancestral Māori fishing rights. Both groups have been granted fishing quotas.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Chatham and Pitt Islands are inhabited, with 600 residents in the 2013 Census.&lt;ref name=Quickstats&gt;{{NZ Quickstats2013|15197|Chatham Islands Territory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Waitangi, Chatham Islands|Waitangi]] is the main settlement with some 200 residents. There are other villages such as [[Owenga]], Te One and Kaingaroa, where there are two primary schools. A third school is on Pitt Island. There are also the fishing villages of Owenga and Port Hutt.&lt;ref name=Quickstats /&gt;

Waitangi facilities include a hospital with resident doctor, bank, several stores, and engineering and marine services. The main shipping wharf is located here.

According to the 2013 census there were 264 occupied dwellings, 69 unoccupied dwellings, and 3 dwellings under construction.&lt;ref name="Quickstats"/&gt;

Of the residential population, 315 (52.5%) were male compared to 48.7% nationally, and 285 (47.5%) were female, compared to 51.3% nationally. The archipelago had a median age of 41.5 years, 3.5 years above the national median age of 38.0 years.

==Transport==
[[File:Landing approach to Tuuta Airport, Chatham Island.jpg|thumb|Visitors to the Chathams generally arrive in the islands via [[Tuuta Airport]].]]
Visitors to the Chathams usually arrive by air from [[Auckland]], [[Christchurch]] or [[Wellington]] (around 1.5 – 2 hours from Christchurch on a [[Convair 580#Variants|Convair 580]]) to [[Tuuta Airport]] on Chatham Island. While freight generally arrives by ship (2 days sailing time), the sea journey takes too long for many passengers, and is not always available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverthechathamislands.co.nz/visit/Getting-around/ |title=Getting to the Chatham Island |publisher=Discoverthechathamislands.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925052912/http://www.discoverthechathamislands.co.nz/visit/Getting-around/ |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CISL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chathamislandsshipping.co.nz/ |title=Chatham Islands Shipping Ltd |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chathams are part of New Zealand so there are no border controls or formalities on arrival, but visitors are advised to have prearranged their accommodation on the islands. Transport operators may refuse to carry passengers without accommodation bookings. There is no scheduled public transport but accommodation providers are normally able to arrange transport.

[[TEAL|Tasman Empire Airways Ltd (TEAL)]] initially serviced the Chathams by air using [[flying boats]]. With the withdrawal of TEAL, the RNZAF maintained an infrequent service with [[Short Sunderland]] flying boats. NZ4111 was damaged on takeoff from Te Whanga Lagoon on 4 November 1959 and remains as a wreck on the island. The last flight by RNZAF flying boats was on 22 March 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=www.seawings.co.uk|first=flying boat forum|title=Short flying boats in New Zealand|url=http://theflyingboatforum.forumlaunch.net/viewtopic.php?f=62&amp;t=985&amp;start=50|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years [[Bristol Freighter]] aircraft served the islands, a slow and noisy freight aircraft converted for carrying passengers by installing a removable passenger compartment equipped with [[airline seat]]s and a toilet in part of the cargo hold. The air service primarily served to ship out high-value export [[crayfish]] products.

The grass landing field at Hapupu, at the northern end of the Island, proved a limiting factor, as few aircraft apart from the Bristol Freighter had both the range to fly to the islands and the ruggedness to land on the grass airstrip. Although other aircraft did use the landing field occasionally, they would often require repairs to fix damage resulting from the rough landing. Hapupu is also the site of the [[JM Barker (Hapupu) Historic Reserve|JM Barker (Hapupu) National Historic Reserve]] (one of only two in New Zealand) where there are momori rakau (Moriori tree carvings).

In 1981, after many years of requests by locals and the imminent demise of the ageing Bristol Freighters, the construction of a sealed runway at Karewa, [[Tuuta Airport]], allowed more modern aircraft to land safely. The Chathams' own airline, [[Air Chathams]], now operates services to Auckland on Thursdays, Wellington on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and Christchurch on Tuesdays. The timetable varies seasonally, but generally planes depart the Chathams around 10.30&amp;nbsp;am (Chathams Time) and arrive in the mainland around noon. There they refuel and reload, and depart again at around 1&amp;nbsp;pm back to the Chathams. Air Chathams operates twin turboprop [[Convair 580#Variants|Convair 580]] aircraft in combi (freight and passenger) configurations and [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner|Fairchild Metroliners]].

The ship ''Rangatira'' provided a freight service from [[Timaru]] to the Chatham Islands from March 2000 to August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The good ship Rangatira |first=Fergus |last=Blakiston |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/life/71498342/The-good-ship-Rangatira |newspaper=The Timaru Herald |date=29 August 2015 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MV ''Southern Tiare'' provides a freight service between [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], Timaru and the Chathams.&lt;ref name=CISL/&gt;

There is a small section of tar sealed road between Waitangi and Te One, but the majority of the islands' roads are gravel.

==Government==
[[File:Flag of Chatham Islands.svg|right|thumb|[[Flag of the Chatham Islands|Chatham Islands Flag]] (unofficial, but widely used on the Islands)]]

===Electorates===
Until the 1980s, the Chathams were in the [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] electorate, but since then they have formed part of the [[Rongotai (New Zealand electorate)|Rongotai]] general electorate, which mostly lies in Wellington. [[Paul Eagle]] is the MP for Rongotai. The [[Te Tai Tonga]] [[Māori seats|Māori seat]] (held since 2011 by Rino Tirikatene) includes the Chatham Islands.

===Local government===
Local government on the islands, uniquely within [[New Zealand]], involves a council established by its own Act of Parliament, the Chatham Islands Council Act 1995 (Statute No 041, Commenced: 1 November 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gpacts.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpacts/public/text/1995/an/041.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712233630/http://gpacts.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpacts/public/text/1995/an/041.html |archivedate=12 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; The Chatham Islands Council&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.cic.govt.nz/&lt;/ref&gt; operates as a [[Districts of New Zealand|district council]] with [[Regions of New Zealand|regional council]] functions, making it in effect a [[unitary authority]] but with not quite as many responsibilities as the others.  The Council comprises a Mayor and eight Councillors, one of whom is also Deputy Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cic.govt.nz/your-council/&lt;/ref&gt; Certain regional council functions are being administered by [[Environment Canterbury]], the Canterbury Regional Council.

In the 2010 local government elections, Chatham Islands had NZ's highest rate of returned votes, with 71.3 percent voting.&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Herald'', 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===State services===
[[New Zealand Police|Policing]] is carried out by a sole-charge [[constable]] appointed by the [[Wellington]] police district, who has often doubled as an official for many [[State sector organisations in New Zealand|government departments]], including court registrar (Department for Courts), customs officer (New Zealand Customs Service) and immigration officer (Department of Labour – New Zealand Immigration Service).

A District Court judge sent from either the [[North Island]] or the [[South Island]] presides over court sittings, but urgent sittings may take place at the Wellington District Court.

Because of the isolation and small population, some of the rules governing daily activities undergo a certain relaxation. For example, every transport service operated solely on [[Great Barrier Island]], the Chatham Islands or [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]] need not comply with section 70C of the Transport Act 1962 (the requirements for drivers to maintain driving-hours logbooks). Drivers subject to section 70B must nevertheless keep record of their driving hours in some form.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Zealand Gazette]]'' 14 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
From 1 July 2015 the Canterbury District Health Board assumed responsibility from the Hawkes Bay District Health Board for providing publicly funded health services for the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/69641932/Ministry-of-Health-concerned-about-financial-performance-of-CDHB|newspaper=The Press|title=Ministry of Health 'concerned about financial performance' of CDHB|first=Ashleigh|last=Stewart|date=25 July 2015|quote=As of July 1, control of the Chatham Islands' health services will transfer to Canterbury.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{See also|List of schools in Chatham Islands}}

Three schools are located on the Chathams, at Kaingaroa, Te One, and Pitt Island. Pitt Island and Kaingaroa are staffed by sole charge principals, while Te One has three teachers and a principal. These schools cater for children from year 1 to 8. No secondary school is present on the Chathams. The majority of secondary school-aged students leave the island for boarding schools in mainland New Zealand. A small number remain on the island and carry out their secondary education through correspondence.

==Economy==
Most of the Chatham Island economy is based on fishing and crayfishing, with only a fragment of the economic activity in adventure tourism. This economic mix has been stable for the past 50 years, as little infrastructure or population is present to engage in higher levels of industrial or telecommunications activity.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, page 2 of the Chatham Islands Council 2015-2016 Annual Report, http://www.cic.govt.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Chatham_Islands_Annual_Report_2015-16_Web_Version.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air Chathams]] has its head office in Te One.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airchathams.co.nz/contact-us.html |title=Contact Us |publisher=Airchathams.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909224526/http://www.airchathams.co.nz/contact-us.html |archivedate=9 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electricity generation===
Two 225-kW wind turbines and diesel generators provide power on Chatham island, at costs of five to ten times that of electricity on the main islands of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windenergy.org.nz/chatham-islands-wind-farm|title=Chatham Islands Wind Farm|publisher=New Zealand Wind Energy Association|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During 2014, 65% of the electricity was generated from diesel generators, the balance from wind.&lt;ref&gt;See the 2013-14 Chatham Islands Electricity Ltd Annual Report on page 6 of this document https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1OcswQ6_z-OSmVwTDNBdGEycTA/edit&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1686">'''Chilton–Colburn J-factor analogy''' is a successful and widely used analogy between [[heat transfer|heat]], [[momentum]], and [[mass transfer]]. The basic mechanisms and mathematics of heat, mass, and momentum transport are essentially the same. Among many analogies (like [[Reynolds analogy]], Prandtl–Taylor analogy) developed to directly relate [[heat transfer]] coefficients, [[mass transfer]] coefficients, and [[friction]] factors Chilton and Colburn J-factor analogy proved to be the most accurate.  

It is written as follows,

&lt;math&gt;J_M=\frac{f}{2} = J_H = \frac{h}{c_p\, G}\,{Pr}^{\frac{2}{3}}= J_D = \frac{k'_c}{\overline{v}} \cdot {Sc}^{\frac{2}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation permits the prediction of an unknown transfer coefficient when one of the other coefficients is known. The analogy is valid for fully developed [[turbulent flow]] in conduits with ''[[Reynolds number|Re]]'' &gt; 10000, 0.7 &lt; ''[[Prandtl number|Pr]]'' &lt; 160, and tubes where ''L''/''d'' &gt; 60 (the same constraints as the [[Nusselt number|Sieder–Tate correlation]]). The wider range of data can be correlated by Friend–Metzner analogy.

Relationship between Heat and Mass;

&lt;math&gt;J_M = \frac{f}{2} = \frac{Sh}{Re\, Sc^{\frac{1}{3}}} = J_H = \frac{f}{2} = \frac{Nu}{Re\, Pr^{\frac{1}{3}}}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3104">The '''cubical atom''' was an early [[atom]]ic model in which [[electron]]s were positioned at the eight corners of a cube in a non-polar atom or molecule.  This theory was developed in 1902 by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and published in 1916 in the article "The Atom and the Molecule" and used to account for the phenomenon of [[Valency (chemistry)|valency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Lewis's theory was based on [[Abegg's rule]]. It was further developed in 1919 by [[Irving Langmuir]] as the '''cubical octet atom'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Image:cubical atom 1.svg|center]]

Although the cubical model of the atom was soon abandoned in favor of the [[quantum mechanical]] model based on the [[Schrödinger equation]], and is therefore now principally of historical interest, it represented an important step towards the understanding of the chemical bond. The 1916 article by Lewis also introduced the concept of the electron pair in the [[covalent bond]], the [[octet rule]], and the now-called [[Lewis structure]].

==Bonding in the cubical atom model==

Single covalent bonds are formed when two atoms share an edge, as in structure '''C''' below. This results in the sharing of two electrons. Ionic bonds are formed by the transfer of an electron from one cube to another, without sharing an edge ('''A'''). An intermediate state '''B''' where only one corner is shared was also postulated by Lewis.

[[Image:cubical atom 2.svg]]

Double bonds are formed by sharing a face between two cubic atoms. This results in sharing four electrons:

[[Image:cubical atom 3.svg]]

Triple bonds could not be accounted for by the cubical atom model, because there is no way of having two cubes share three parallel edges. Lewis suggested that the electron pairs in atomic bonds have a special attraction, which result in a tetrahedral structure, as in the figure below (the new location of the electrons is represented by the dotted circles in the middle of the thick edges). This allows the formation of a single bond by sharing a corner, a double bond by sharing an edge, and a triple bond by sharing a face. It also accounts for the free rotation around single bonds and for the tetrahedral geometry of methane.

&lt;!--IMAGE: no size, to auto-widen per user-settings--&gt;[[File:The Three Patriarchs in Zion Canyon.jpg|thumb|right|Massive cliffs in [[Zion National Park|Zion Canyon]] consist of Lower Jurassic formations, including (from bottom to top): the [[Kayenta Formation]] and the massive [[Navajo Sandstone]].]]

The '''Early Jurassic''' [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] (in [[chronostratigraphy]] corresponding to the '''Lower Jurassic''' [[series (stratigraphy)|series]]) is the earliest of three epochs of the [[Jurassic]] period. The Early Jurassic starts immediately after the [[Triassic-Jurassic extinction event]], 201.3 Ma&amp;nbsp;(million years ago), and ends at the start of the [[Middle Jurassic]] 174.1&amp;nbsp;Ma.

Certain rocks of marine origin of this age in Europe are called "[[Lias Group|Lias]]" and that name was used for the period, as well, in 19th-century geology.&lt;ref&gt;Rudwick, M.J.S (1992): Scenes from Deep Time: Early Pictorial Representations of the Prehistoric World, [[University of Chicago Press]], 280 pages. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eM0xUqbjzs0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Except] from Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; In southern Germany rocks of this age are called [[Black Jurassic]].

==Origin of the name Lias==
There are two possible origins for the name Lias: the first reason is it was taken by a [[geologist]] from an [[England|English]] [[quarryman]]'s [[dialect]] pronunciation of the word "layers"; secondly, [[sloops]] from north [[Cornwall|Cornish]] ports such as [[Bude]] would sail across the [[Bristol Channel]] to the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] to load up with rock from coastal [[limestone]] quarries (lias limestone from South Wales was used throughout North Devon/North Cornwall as it contains calcium carbonate to fertilise the poor quality Devonian soils of the West Country); the Cornish would pronounce the layers of limestone as 'laiyers' or 'lias'.

==Geology==
There are extensive Liassic outcrops around the coast of the [[United Kingdom]], in particular in [[Glamorgan]], [[North Yorkshire]] and [[Dorset]]. The [[Jurassic coast|'Jurassic Coast']] of Dorset is often associated with the pioneering work of [[Mary Anning]] of [[Lyme Regis]]. The [[facies]] of the Lower Jurassic in this area are predominantly of [[clays]], thin [[limestones]] and [[siltstones]], deposited under fully marine conditions.

Lias Group [[stratum|strata]] form imposing cliffs on the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] coast, in southern [[Wales]]. Stretching for around {{convert|14|mi}} between [[Cardiff]] and [[Porthcawl]], the remarkable layers of these cliffs, situated on the [[Bristol Channel]] are a rhythmic decimetre scale repetition of limestone and [[mudstone]] formed as a late Triassic desert was inundated by the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, S., Owen, G. &amp; Sharpe, T. 2005 ''Walking the Rocks'' [[South Wales Geologists' Association|Geologists' Association - South Wales Group]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stratigraphy===
There has been some debate&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurassic.earth.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/10615/ISJS_Newsletter_No_35_pt_1.pdf International Subcommission on Jurassic Stratigraphy. Newsletter 35/1, December 2008, Edited by Nicol Morton and Stephen Hesselbo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128115142/http://jurassic.earth.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/10615/ISJS_Newsletter_No_35_pt_1.pdf |date=2015-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; over the actual base of the [[Hettangian]] stage, and so of the Jurassic system itself. [[Biostratigraphy|Biostratigraphically]], the first appearance of [[Psiloceratidae|psiloceratid]] [[ammonites]] has been used; but this depends on relatively complete ammonite faunas being present, a problem that makes correlation between sections in different parts of the world difficult. If this biostratigraphical indicator is used, then technically the [[Lias Group]]—a [[Lithostratigraphy|lithostratigraphical]] division—spans the Jurassic / [[Triassic]] boundary.

==Life==

===Ammonites===
During this period, [[ammonoid]]s, which had almost died out at the end-of-Triassic extinction, radiated out into a huge diversity of new forms with complex suture patterns (the ammonites proper).  Ammonites evolved so rapidly, and their shells are so often preserved, that they serve as important [[zone fossil]]s.  There were several distinct waves of ammonite evolution in Europe alone.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Davies, 1920, pp. 173–75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine reptiles===
The Early Jurassic was an important time in the evolution of the marine reptiles.  The Hettangian saw the already existing [[Rhaetian]] [[ichthyosaur]]s and [[plesiosaur]]s continuing to flourish, while at the same time a number of new types of these [[marine reptile]]s appeared, such as ''[[Ichthyosaurus]]'' and ''[[Temnodontosaurus]]'' among the ichthyosaurs, and ''[[Eurycleidus]]'', ''[[Macroplata]]'', and ''[[Rhomaleosaurus]]'' among the plesiosaurs (all [[Rhomaleosauridae]], although as currently defined this group is probably [[paraphyletic]]).  All these plesiosaurs had medium-sized necks and large heads.  In the [[Toarcian]], at the end of the Early Jurassic, the [[thalattosuchia]]ns (marine "[[Crocodylomorpha|crocodiles]]") appeared, as did new [[genus|genera]] of ichthyosaurs (''[[Stenopterygius]]'', ''[[Eurhinosaurus]]'', and the persistently primitive ''[[Suevoleviathan]]'') and plesiosaurs (the [[Elasmosauridae|elasmosaurs]] (long-necked) ''[[Microcleidus]]'' and ''[[Occitanosaurus]]'', and the [[Pliosauridae|pliosaur]] ''[[Hauffiosaurus]]'').

===Terrestrial animals===
[[File:Drzewica Formation Reconstruction.jpg|right|thumb|Example of Rare Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian) Ecosystem, the [[Drzewica Formation]] of [[Szydłowiec]], [[Poland]]. This zone was characterised by a very damp ecosystem populated by Dinosaur Megafauna, more related in several aspects to Middle or Late Jurassic Dinosaurs]]
On land, a number of new types of dinosaurs—the [[Heterodontosauridae|heterodontosaurids]], [[Scelidosaurus|scelidosaurs]], [[stegosaur]]s, and [[tetanurae|tetanurans]]—appeared, and joined those groups like the [[coelophysoidea|coelophysoids]], [[prosauropoda|prosauropods]] and the [[sauropod]]s that had continued over from the Triassic. Accompanying them as small carnivores were the [[sphenosuchia]]n and [[Protosuchus|protosuchid]] crocodilians.  In the air, new types of [[pterosaur]]s replaced those that had died out at the end of the Triassic. But in the undergrowth were various types of early mammals, as well as [[Tritylodontidae|tritylodont]] mammal-like reptiles, lizard-like [[Sphenodontia|sphenodonts]], and early [[lissamphibia]]ns.

'''Eurilla Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] located in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] in the suburb of [[Crafers, South Australia| Crafers]] in the [[Adelaide Hills]] state government region about {{convert|11|km}} south-east of the state capital of [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide]] and about {{convert|2.4|km}} north of the town centre in [[Stirling, South Australia| Stirling]].&lt;ref name=LMV/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRE"/&gt;


The conservation park consists of land in section 535 in the cadastral unit of the [[Hundred of Onkaparinga]].  It is located to the east of the Mount Lofty Summit Road about {{convert|1|km}} south of the summit of [[Mount Lofty]] and is bounded on its northern boundary by the [[Cleland Conservation Park]]. &lt;ref name=LMV/&gt;  It was proclaimed under the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' on 22 September 1977. &lt;ref name="SAGG-1977"/&gt;  As of 2016, it covered an area of {{convert|7|ha}}.&lt;ref name="ReserveList"/&gt;

In 1980, it was described as follows: &lt;ref name="NRE"&gt;{{cite AHD|6578| Eurilla Conservation Park – listing on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate |date=1980|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The main feature, and reason for dedication of the park, is an undisturbed bog consisting of a dense mat of the rare coral fern (''[[Gleichenia microphylla]]'') and a sizeable colony of mature king fern (''[[Todea barbara]]''), an endangered species in South Australia.  These specimens are amongst the finest in the state.  An excellent bog habitat surrounded by ''[[Eucalyptus obliqua]]'' open forest over an open shrub stratum of ''[[Exocarpos cupressiformis]]'', ''[[Banksia marginata]]'' and ''[[Pultenaea daphnoides]]''.  A dense ground stratum consists of a wide variety of herbs, grasses and forbs.  There are many fallen logs in various stages of decay together with a substantial accumulation of forest litter.  The park is substantially undisturbed and surrounded by native vegetation on three sides.  This area has not been burnt since 1920, and suffers only minor influence from introduced species.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name=CAPAD2016SASum/&gt;  In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct [[Register of the National Estate]].&lt;ref name="NRE"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6633">[[file:Example of cylindrical flywheel rotor assembly.png|thumb|right|Sectional view of a flywheel storage with magnetic bearings and evacuated housing]]
A flywheel-storage power system uses a [[flywheel]] for energy storage, (see [[Flywheel energy storage]]) and can be a comparatively small storage facility with a peak power of up to 20 MW. It typically is used to stabilize to some degree power grids, to help them stay on the grid frequency,  and to serve as a short-term compensation storage. Unlike common storage power plants, such as the [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage power plants]] with capacities up to 1000 MW, the benefits from flywheel storage power plants can be obtained with a facility in the range of a few kW to several 10 MW. &lt;ref&gt;[http://beaconpower.com/hazle-township-pennsylvania/ Schwungrad-Speicherkraftwerk in Hazle Township, Pennsylvania] (USA), Betreiberseite ''beaconpower''&lt;/ref&gt; They are comparable in this application with [[Battery storage power station|battery storage power plants]].

Possible areas of application are places where electrical energy can be obtained and stored, and must be supplied again to compensate for example, fluctuations in the seconds range in wind or solar power. These storage facilities consist of individual flywheels in a modular design. Energy up to 150 kW can be absorbed or released per flywheel. Through combinations of several such flywheel accumulators, which are individually housed in buried underground vacuum tanks, a total power of up to several 10 MW can be achieved. The electrical connections power low voltage motors via a DC intermediate circuit and the power converter systems are comparable to those found in plants used in the high-voltage direct current transmissions application. &lt;ref&gt;[http://beaconpower.com/power-electronics/ Power Electronics], Darstellung der Leistungselektronik, Betreiberseite ''beaconpower''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes [[battery storage power station]]s are built with flywheel storage power systems in order to conserve battery power. Flywheels can handle rapid fluctuations better.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRhvpaXszTc zdf-video], ZDF - Planet E - Schwungradspeicher &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utilitydive.com/news/pge-contracts-for-75-mw-of-energy-storage-on-its-way-to-580-mw-of-capacity/410242/ utilitydive.com], PG&amp;E contracts for 75 MW of energy storage which is planned to be increased to 580 MW of capacity &lt;/ref&gt;

==Application examples==
===Vehicle braking and acceleration===
In vehicles small storage of power flywheels are used as an additional mechanism with batteries, to store the braking energy by regeneration. Power can be stored in the short term and then released back into the acceleration phase of a vehicle with very large electrical currents. This conserves battery power. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRhvpaXszTc zdf-video], ZDF - Planet E - Schwungradspeicher &lt;/ref&gt;

===Tram braking and acceleration - power smoothing=== 
Flywheel storage for trams are a good application. During braking (such as when arriving at a station), high energy peaks are found which can not be always fed back into the power grid due to overloading danger. The flywheel energy storage power plants are in containers on side of the tracks and take the excess electrical energy. For example, up to 200 000 kWh energy per brake system are annually recovered in Zwickau.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRhvpaXszTc zdf-video], ZDF - Planet E - Schwungradspeicher, Minute 17:03 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Power grid frequency control===
In [[Stephentown, New York]], [[Beacon Power]] operates in a flywheel storage power plant with 200 flywheels of 25 kWh capacity and 100 kW of power. Ganged together this gives 5 MWh capacity and 20 MW of power. The units operate at a peak speed at 15,000 rpm. The rotor flywheel consists of wound CFRP fibers which are filled with resin. The installation is intended primarily for frequency control. This service is sold to the New York power grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanthinking.de/wochenserie-stromspeicher-schwungradspeicher-von-rotokinetik-und-beacon-power/ cleanthinking.de BEACON Power, USA] &lt;/ref&gt;

Stadtwerke München (SWM, Munich, Germany) uses a flywheel storage power system to stabilize the power grid, as well as control energy and to compensate for deviations from renewable energy sources. The plant originates from the Jülich Stornetic GmbH. The system consists of 28 flywheels and has a capacity of 100 kWh and a capacity of 600 kilovolt-amperes (kVA). The flywheels rotate at a peak speed of 45,000 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aachener-zeitung.de/lokales/juelich/stadtwerke-muenchen-vermarkten-juelicher-speicher-1.1220620 aachener-zeitung.de Stadtwerke München vermarkten Jülicher Speicher] &lt;/ref&gt;

In Ontario, Canada, Temporal Power Ltd. has operated a flywheel storage power plant since 2014. It consists of 10 flywheels made of steel. Each flywheel weighs four tons and is 2.5 meters high. The maximum rotational speed is 11,500 rpm. The maximum power is 2 MW. The system is used for frequency regulation. After a successful three-year trial period, the system is to be expanded to 20 MW and 100 MW.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/business/2014/11/07/ontario_electricity_gets_taken_for_a_spin.html# thestar.com Ontario electricity gets taken for a spin] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewable energy time shift===
The city of Fresno in California is running flywheel storage power plants built by Amber Kinetics to store solar energy, which is produced in excess quantity in the daytime, for consumption at night. &lt;ref&gt;[http://kvpr.org/post/fresno-project-store-solar-electricity-using-flywheel kvpr.org Fresno Project To Store Solar Electricity Using Flywheel ] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Unclear===
On the island of [[Aruba]] is currently a 5 MW flywheel storage power plant built by Temporal Power Ltd.{{why|date=March 2018}} The island of Aruba intends to convert its energy supply to 100 percent renewables by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/arubatoday/docs/atd02november2015/13 issuu.com Innovative Flywheel Project Supports Aurba's Move to 100% Renewable Energy] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy loss==
It is now (since 2013) possible to build a flywheel storage system that loses just 5 percent of the energy stored in it, per day (i.e.the self-discharge rate).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRhvpaXszTc zdf-video], ZDF Feb 2013 - Planet E - Schwungradspeicher, Minute 24:35 In German&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7069">The derivation of the term '''Geoheritage'''  is from ''geological heritage''. It is thus as heritage category comparable to other forms of [[natural heritage]], such as [[biodiversity]].  Some geoheritage sites are related to human activity such as mining, and can also be viewed in terms of [[cultural heritage]].

''Geoheritage'' is also the title of a periodical published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] from 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/geoheritage/oclc/566133535 ISSN 1867-2485]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
The first reference to geoheritage as such was at a 1993 conference held in the UK, the Malvern International Conference on Geological and Landscape Conservation (Joyce 1994b; &lt;ref&gt;Joyce E B 1994a Geological Heritage Committee. In: B J Cooper &amp; D F Branagan (eds), Rock me hard. Rock me soft. a history of the Geological Society of Australia Inc. Published by [[Geological Society of Australia]] Inc., Sydney, NSW, 30-36&lt;/ref&gt; O'Halloran et al. 1994&lt;ref&gt;O'Halloran D, Green C, Harley, M Stanley M, &amp; Knil J (eds) 1994 Geological and Landscape Conservation. Proceedings of the Malvern International Conference 1993. [[Geological Society]], London, UK&lt;/ref&gt;), geoconservation.

The term geological heritage was first mentioned at the First International Symposium on the Conservation of our Geological Heritage at [[Digne-les-Bains|Digne]], France in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Anon 1991 First International Symposium on the Conservation of our Geological Heritage, Digne, France, 11–16 June 1991: Terra Abstracts Supplement 2 to Terra Nova Volume 3, 1991, 17&lt;/ref&gt; The matter is further discussed in 2002 by Sharples.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples C 2002 Concepts and principles of geoconservation. Tasmanian Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, Hobart&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptually, geoheritage derives from various writings of Busby et al. 2001&lt;ref&gt;Busby III A B, Conrads R, Willis P &amp; Roots D 2001 An Australian Geographic Guide to Fossils &amp; Rocks: Australian Geographic NSW&lt;/ref&gt; and Hallam 1989&lt;ref&gt;[[Hallam, Anthony]] 1989 ''Great Geological Controversies'' (2nd Ed). Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK&lt;/ref&gt;).

In Sharples 1995&lt;ref&gt;Sharples C 1995 Geoconservation in forest management - principles and procedures. Tasforests 7: 37-50&lt;/ref&gt; the original concept of geoheritage was further developed to include the protection of dynamic geological processes and geodiversity.

==Definition==
M Brocx &amp; V Semeniuk (Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia, 90: 53-87, 2007) offer the following definition.

Geoheritage encompasses global, national, statewide, and local features of geology, at all scales
that are intrinsically important sites or culturally important sites offering information or insights
into the evolution of the Earth; or into the history of science, or that can be used for research,
teaching, or reference.

==Geotourism==
{{main|Geotourism}}

“Geotourism is a knowledge -based tourism, an interdisciplinary integration of the tourism industry with conservation and interpretation of abiotic nature attributes, besides considering related cultural issues, within the geosites for the general public”.It is seen around the world through the growth of [[geopark]]s as well as independently in many natural and urban areas where tourism’s focus is on the geological environment.

==Examples of geoheritage sites==

===Australia===
In Australia, the term geoheritage appeared initially in Bradbury (1993),&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury J 1993 A Preliminary Geoheritage Inventory of the Eastern Tasmania Terrane. A Report to Parks and Wildlife Service, Tasmania.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sharples (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Sharples C 1993 A Methodology for the identification of significant landforms and geological sites for geoconservation purposes. Report to Forestry Commission Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia there are sites which have natural features (such as Fossil Hill at [[Cliefden Caves]], NSW); cultural features (such as the site of the discovery of the first limestone in inland Australia at Cliefden Caves); scenically important sites such as the [[Three Sisters (Australia)|Three Sisters]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]; and indigenous culturally important sites (such as [[Uluru]] in the [[Northern Territory]] in central Australia).

===Indonesia===

The Geological Agency of the Indonesian Energy and Resources Ministry has declared nine geological sites in the province of [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]] in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/03/nine-unique-geo-heritage-sites-declared.html Nine unique geo-heritage sites declared'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 3 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are:

In [[Sleman Regency]]:

* [[Eocene]] limestone at Gamping (just to the west of [[Yogyakarta]] city).
* [[Pillow lava]] at Berbah (south of [[Prambanan]] temple area).
* Prehistoric volcanic sediment at [[Candi Ijo]] (south of [[Prambanan]] temple area).
* [[Prambanan]] temple area (east of Yogyakarta city).

In [[Bantul Regency]]:

===Spain===

The Geological Society of Spain and the [[Geological and Mining Institute of Spain]] have produced a list of internationally important [[geosite]]s (sites of geological interest).
This work, which began in 1999, is part of the Global Geosites project promoted by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] in the 1990s and subsequently supported by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name="Geosites"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.igme.es/patrimonio/GlobalGeosites.htm#Esp |title=El Proyecto Global Geosites en España |access-date=9 August 2016 |publisher=IGME}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, geological contexts were identified (21 such contexts were listed by 2014), and then representative sites within these themes.  The list of sites is not a closed one, and there is a mechanism for considering further nominations.

[[Teide]] volcano, [[Tenerife]], has been designated a [[World Heritage Site]] in part for its geological interest.  Some other WHSs in Spain are of geological interest, but were selected for other features.  For example, Spain has one of the two sites of the WHS [[Heritage of Mercury. Almadén and Idrija]]. However, the criteria by which Almadén was assessed by [[UNESCO]] relate to its mining heritage rather than geological interest.

'''Groutite''' is a [[manganese]] [[oxide mineral]] with formula Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;O(OH). It is a member of the [[diaspore]] group and is [[Polymorphism (materials science)|trimorphous]] with [[manganite]] and [[feitknechtite]]. It forms lustrous black crystals in the [[orthorhombic system]].

It occurs in weathered [[banded iron formation]]s, [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] manganese ore bodies and [[hydrothermal]] ore environments.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;
It was first described in 1945 for an occurrence in the Mahnomen mine, [[Cuyuna Range]], [[Crow Wing County, Minnesota]] and named for [[petrologist]] [[Frank Fitch Grout]] (1880–1958), of the University of Minnesota.&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt;

The '''''ISTTOK Tokamak''''' ("Instituto Superior Técnico TOKamak") is a research [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactor ([[tokamak]]) of the [[Instituto Superior Técnico]]. It has a circular cross-section due to a poloidal graphite limiter and an iron core transformer. Its particularity is that it is one of the few tokamaks operating in AC (alternating plasma current) regime, as well in DC regime. In 2013, the AC operation allowed the standard discharges to extend from 35 ms to more than 1s.

[[File:Nordbahnbrücke-Wien Eisstoß.jpg|thumb|Ice jam on the [[Danube River]] at a bridge in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]]]
'''Ice jams''' occur on rivers when [[Cryosphere#Lake_ice_and_river_ice|floating ice]] accumulates at a natural or man-made feature that impedes its progress downstream. Ice jams can significantly reduce the flow of a river and cause upstream flooding—sometimes called '''ice dams'''.  Ice jam flooding can also occur downstream when the jam releases in an [[outburst flood]]. In either case, flooding can cause damage to structures on shore. 

==Overview==
[[Image:Eagle Alaska ice1.jpg|thumb|[[Eagle, Alaska]], inundated by flood water and ice floes after a ice jam formed downstream on the [[Yukon River]].]]

An ice blockage on a river is usually called an ''ice jam,'' but sometimes an ''ice dam''.&lt;ref&gt;"Ice dam". def. 1. Monkhouse, Francis J.. ''A dictionary of geography'': 2nd ed.. Leeds: E.J. Arnold, 1970. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; An ice jam is an obstruction on a river formed by blocks of ice. Defined by the International Association of Hydraulic Research (IAHR) Working Group on River Ice Hydraulics an ice jam is a "...a stationary accumulation of fragmented ice or [[Frazil ice|frazil]] that restricts flow" on a river or stream. The jam may effectively create a dam with an accumulation of [[anchor ice]] on the bottom of the river.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-NGKtJX4JoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Beltaos,+S.+River+ice+jams.+Highlands+Ranch,+Colo.:+Water+Resources+Publications,+1995.+71.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNsJW4h5LaAhWnna0KHZxeAjAQuwUIMzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ice%20jam&amp;f=false|title=River Ice Jams|last=Beltaos|first=S.|date=1995|publisher=Water Resources Publication|year=|isbn=9780918334879|location=Highlands Ranch, Colorado|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On rivers the obstruction may be a change of width, structure, bend or decrease in gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/media/dmx/Hydro/DMX_InfoSht_IceJamsAndFlooding.pdf|title=Ice Jams &amp; Flooding|last=Editor|first=|date=|website=National Weather Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ice jam floods are less predictable and potentially more destructive than open-water flooding and can produce much deeper and faster flooding. Ice jam floods also may occur during freezing weather, and may leave large pieces of ice behind, but they are much more localized than open-water floods. Ice jams also damage an economy by causing river-side industrial facilities such as [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] generating stations to shut down and to interfere with [[ship transport]]. The United States averages 125 million dollars in losses to ice jams per year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/floodsafety/ice_jam.shtml |title=Ice Jams |publisher=Nws.noaa.gov |date=2013-03-13 |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a473/2272511/|title=Ice Dams: Taming An Icy River|last=Staff writer|first=|date=2006-02-07|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
[[File:Kry2.jpg|thumb|Ice floes/cakes left over on a river bank after an ice jam]]
Ice jams on rivers usually occur in the springtime as the river ice begins to ''break up'', but may also occur in early winter during ''freeze-up''. The break-up process is described in three phases: pre-break-up, break-up and final drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0ORT-1sFDgC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Fluvial+hydraulics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0lb-TjpLaAhVMnq0KHWfZASgQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=break%20up&amp;f=false|title=Fluvial Hydraulics|last=Dingman|first=S. Lawrence|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780198038566|location=|pages=104|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pre-break-up'' usually begins with increased springtime river flow, water level, and temperatures fracturing the river ice and separating it from the shore. Changes in river height from dam releases may also affect the pre-break-up. During the ''break-up'', the ice in areas of rapids is carried downstream as an [[ice floe]] and may jam on still frozen sections of ice on calm water or against structures in the river such as the [[Honeymoon Bridge (Ontario)|Honeymoon Bridge]], destroyed in 1938 by an ice jam. Smaller jams may dislodge, flow downstream and form a larger jam. During the ''final drive'', a large jam will dislodge and take out the remaining jams, clearing the river of ice in a matter of hours. Ice jams usually occur in spring, but they can happen as winter sets in when the downstream part becomes frozen first. Freeze-up jams may be larger because the ice is stronger and temperatures are continuing to cool unlike a spring break-up when the environment is warming, but are less likely to suddenly release water.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UBuQw8jUzIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=River+Ice+Jams+and+Mitigation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzgtHwjJLaAhUQZKwKHWEfDngQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=River%20Ice%20Jams%20and%20Mitigation&amp;f=false|title=Ice Jam Flooding and Mitigation: Lower Platte River Basin, Nebraska|last=White|first=Kathleen D.|last2=Kay|first2=Roger L.|last3=(U.S.)|first3=Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory|date=1996|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=9781428913882|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three types of natural ice jams can occur:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# a ''surface jam'', a single layer of ice in a floe on calm water;
# a ''narrow-channel'' or ''wide-channel jam''; and
# a ''hanging jam'', the accumulation of river ice at slow current areas which only occur during freeze-up. 

Ice jams also occur at sharp bends in the river, at man-made objects such as bridge piers, and at [[confluence]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Occurrences and consequences==
In the [[northern hemisphere]], northerly flowing rivers tend to have more ice jams because the upper, more southerly reaches thaw first and the ice gets carried downstream into the still-frozen northerly part. There are three physical hazards of ice jams. The ice floe can form a dam that floods the areas upstream of the jam.  This occurred during the [[2009 Red River Flood]] and the [[2009 Alaska floods]]. As the ice jam breaks apart, a sudden surge of water breaking through can then flood areas downstream of the jam. The third hazard is that the ice buildup and final drive may damage structures in or near the river&lt;ref name="Brit"&gt;{{Britannica|281150|ice jam}}&lt;/ref&gt; and boats in the river.

Ice jams may scour the river bed, causing damage or benefit to wildlife habitats and possibly damage to structures in the river.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Prediction and mitigation==
[[File:CRREL Ice Engineering Facility model of Cazenovia Creek ice jam control structure.jpg|thumb|Model of a structure built to retain river ice upstream of a site on [[Cazenovia Creek]] that was the cause of ice jams during river thaws.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/portals/55/siteimages/121108-A-HB029-011.jpg|title=Cazenovia Creek Ice-Control Structure|last=Lever|first=James H.|last2=Gooch|first2=Gordon|date=August 2000|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Daly|first3=Steven| journal =CRREL/ERDC Technical Report TR | volume =00 | issue =14}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Early warnings of an ice jam include using trained observers to monitor break-up conditions and ice motion detectors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The prevention of ice jams may be accomplished by
# weakening the ice before the break-up by cutting or drilling holes in the ice;
# weakening the ice by dusting it with a dark colored sand; or
# controlling the timing of the break-up using [[ice breaker]]s, towboats, hovercraft, or amphibious excavators. However, the movement of migratory fish is known to be related to freeze-up and break-up, so affecting ice break-up may affect fish migration.

Where [[flood]]s threaten human habitation, the blockage may be artificially cleared.  [[Ice blasting]] using [[dynamite]] may be used, except in urban areas, as well as other mechanical means&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/03/12/vermonts_capital_braces_for_possible_river_flooding/ |title=Vermont's capital braces for possible river flooding |date=2007-03-12 |publisher=Boston Globe |first=John |last=Donnelly}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as excavation equipment, or permanent measures such as ice control structures&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and [[flood control]]. Occasionally, military aircraft have been used to bomb ice jams with limited success as part of an effort to clear them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ydr.com/story/news/history/blogs/yorkspast/2018/01/19/iva-lu-ice/109596154/|title=York's Past: Aerial bombing breaks Susquehanna ice jams|last=Smith|first=Stephen H.|date=January 19, 2018|work=The York Daily Record|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/18/news/mn-65062|title=Russian Planes Bomb Ice Jam|last=Daniszewski|first=John|date=2001-05-18|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/russian-fighter-jets-bomb-40km-ice-jam-prevent-flooding-vologda-1555516|title=Russian fighter jets bomb 40km ice-jam to prevent flooding in Vologda|last=Sridharan|first=Vasudevan|date=2016-04-19|work=International Business Times UK|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The well dates back to the 14th century, and derives from the Churches former past when it was once a Catholic place of worship as St. Catherines Chapel, which has origins from Catherine of Sienna.

The water runs off from nearby hills and has a jovial longstanding joke within the nearby village of how the water runs through the [[Shottskirk]] cemetery bodies, which of course is neither true or founded.

Kate's Well is also the scene of the local legendary giant [[Bertram de Shotts]]'s demise; a gripping tale is told how a young man, namely Willielmo De Muirhead, 1st Laird of Muirhead, killed the Giant. With cunning patience he ambushed Bertram de Shotts, immobilising him by slicing both his hamstrings as he lay down to drink at Kate's Well. Disorientated, Bertram de Shotts was then decapitated in an unpleasant death. A proud, and now wealthy, De Muirhead then carried the blooded head to the King and was rewarded with a 'Hawk's Flight' of land. This land subsequently became Muirhead's Lauchope estate.

The well itself received a much needed boost through a grant organized thanks to the local Community Council group in the early 2000s, which allowed its extensive renovation.

The '''Kodiak&amp;ndash;Bowie Seamount chain''', also called the '''Pratt&amp;ndash;Welker Seamount chain''' and the '''Kodiak Seamounts''', is a [[seamount]] chain in southeastern [[Gulf of Alaska]] stretching from the [[Aleutian Trench]] in the north to [[Bowie Seamount]], the youngest volcano in the chain, which lies {{convert|180|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="SE"&gt;[http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/backgrou/2007/pr10a_e.htm The Bowie Seamount] Retrieved on 2007-09-02&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest volcano in the chain is the [[Kodiak Seamount]]. Although the Kodiak Seamount is the oldest extant seamount in the Kodiak-Bowie chain, the adjacent lower slope contains transverse scars indicating earlier subduction of seamounts.

The Kodiak&amp;ndash;Bowie Seamount chain are mostly [[extinct volcano]]es that formed above the [[Bowie hotspot]]. This is a 100-to-150-km-wide morphological swell presumably of thickened hotspot generated crust, although there are no seismic refraction data across the swell to define crustal thickness. The crest of one such peak, [[Patton Seamount]] originally formed off [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state as a submerged volcano 33 million years ago. Over time, as the Pacific Plate moved steadily northwest, Patton Seamount was carried off the Bowie hotspot and into the Gulf of Alaska. New volcanoes were formed one after another over the hotspot, creating the Kodiak–Bowie Seamount chain.

Explorations of the Kodiak&amp;ndash;Bowie Seamount chain have shown that despite the fact that most of the seamounts were created by the Bowie hotspot, all are unique in their size, shape, and volcanic features. The seamounts teem with deep-sea [[coral]]s, [[sponge]]s, and [[fish]]. Recent expeditions to these seamounts using manned submersibles and ROVs have discovered many marine species and have greatly expanded the knowledge of the range of deep sea corals in this region. For example, the [[Bowie Seamount]] is a biologically rich area with a dynamic and productive ecosystem. Because of this unique biological rich area, Bowie Seamount was declared a [[Marine Protected Area|Pilot Marine Protected Area]] on December 8, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/mpa/bowie/default_e.htm Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301053819/http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/mpa/bowie/default_e.htm |date=2009-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kodiak&amp;ndash;Bowie seamount chain is at the northern [[triple junction]] between the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], [[North American Plate|North American]], and [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]] plates. Available age determinations on Kodiak and Giacomini Seamounts give an approximate average rate of movement along the chain of {{convert|6.5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year.

'''LONGi Green Energy Technology''', formerly '''Xi'an Longi Silicon Materials Corporation''', is one of the six major Chinese manufacturers of [[photovoltaics]] and a developer of solar projects. Longi is the world largest manufacturer of [[monocrystalline silicon wafer]]s and is listed on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]].

==History==
The company was founded February 14, 2000 as Xi'an LONGi Silicon Materials Corporation, with its corporate headquarters in [[Xian, China]].  It changed its name in February 2017 to LONGi Green Energy Technology Co Ltd. to better reflect its wider manufacturing scope after its acquisition of LERRI.  It also dropped the Xi'an location as part of the name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pv-tech.org/news/longi-changes-name Osborne, M. LONGi changes name. PVTech. Feb 23, 2017 12:38 PM GMT.

* LONGi Solar

==Operations==
LONGI Silicon Materials is engaged in the research, manufacture and distribution of monocrystalline ingots.  It is the world's largest silicon single crystal manufacturer. It has rapidly broken world solar efficiency records three times within five months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://renewablesnow.com/news/longi-green-brings-mono-c-si-perc-cell-record-to-236-603359/ Longi Green brings mono c-Si PERC cell record to 23.6%.

Renewables Now. February 28, 2018.  Accessed February 28, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique involves taking a silicon wafer, typically 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;mm thick, and making a multitude of parallel, transverse slices across the wafer, creating a large number of slivers that have a thickness of 50 micrometres and a width equal to the thickness of the original wafer. These slices are rotated 90 degrees, so that the surfaces corresponding to the faces of the original wafer become the edges of the slivers. The result is to convert, for example, a 150&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, 2&amp;nbsp;mm-thick wafer having an exposed silicon surface area of about 175&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per side into about 1000 slivers having dimensions of 100&amp;nbsp;mm × 2&amp;nbsp;mm × 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm, yielding a total exposed silicon surface area of about 2000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per side.  The electrical doping and contacts that had been on the face of the wafer are now located at the edges of the sliver, rather than at the front and rear as in the case of conventional wafer cells, as a result of this rotation.  This results in making the cell sensitive on both sides, from both the front and rear of the cell (a property known as ''bifaciality'').&lt;ref name=sliver&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://solar.anu.edu.au/research/sliver.php|title=Sliver Technology Research at the Australian National University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such results need to be certified by a reliable and trusted external agency, and this accomplishment has been analyzed and certified by China's National Center of Supervision and Inspection on Solar Photovoltaic Product Quality (CPVT).

LONGi claimed in October 2017 that they had achieved the record for a monocrystalline solar cell with a conversion efficiency (23.6%) higher than previously thought possible for a PERC cell. In early 2018 they announced a new efficiency record of 23.6%.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In December 2017, LONGi reported a record bifaciality reading of 82.15% for its ‘Hi-MO2’ mono PERC bifacial module. The company's strategic plan is to triple to 45GW by 2020 its capacity to produce monocrystalline ingots and wafers.

Longi Silicon is a member of the [[Silicon Module Super League]] (SMSL), which had been a group of big-six c-Si module suppliers in the solar PV industry today until Longi was admitted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pv-tech.org/editors-blog/silicon-module-super-league-big-six-to-reach-50-global-market-share-in-2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The other six members of the SMSL group are [[Canadian Solar]], [[Hanwha Q CELLS]], [[JA Solar]], [[Jinko Solar]], [[Trina Solar]],  and [[GCL-Poly|GCL]].

Longi Silicon has been listed on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] (security code: 601012) since April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?capId=112691838 Bloomberg]&lt;/ref&gt;

LONGi has been called the fastest growing PV manufacturer in the industry.  LONGi annual revenue in 2013 was derived entirely from selling around US$330 million of mono c-Si wafers, but by 2016 that annual revenue had skyrocketed to approximately US$1.67 billion.  That was a nearly 94% increase over the 2015 fiscal year, which had itself generated a revenue growth of around 61% over the year before.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pv-tech.org/editors-blog/longi-is-the-fastest-growing-pv-manufacturer-in-the-industry Osborne, M.

National parks of Sweden are managed by the [[Environmental Protection Agency (Sweden)|Swedish Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) ({{lang-sv|Naturvårdsverket}}) and owned by the state. The goal of the [[national park]] service is to create a system of protected areas that represent all the distinct natural regions of the country.&lt;ref name="swedishepa"/&gt; In 1909, [[Sweden]] became the first country in Europe to establish such parks when nine were opened following the [[Riksdag]] passing of a law on national parks that year. This was followed by the establishment of seven parks between 1918 and 1962 and thirteen between 1982 and 2009, with the latest being [[Kosterhavet National Park]].&lt;ref name="swedishepa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/en/In-English/Start/Nature-conservation-and-wildlife/Nature-conservation-and-species-protection/National-parks-and-other-ways-to-protect-nature/|title=National parks and other ways to protect nature|publisher=[[Naturvårdsverket]] (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency)|accessdate=2009-06-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307142117/http://naturvardsverket.se/en/In-English/Start/Nature-conservation-and-wildlife/Nature-conservation-and-species-protection/National-parks-and-other-ways-to-protect-nature/|archivedate=2011-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 29 national parks in Sweden, comprising a total area of 731,589 [[hectare]]s (1,807,796 [[acre]]s);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/sv/Start/Naturvard/Skydd-av-natur/Nationalparker/|title=Nationalparker|language=Swedish|publisher=Naturvårdsverket (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency)|accessdate=2011-06-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69NELrGcH?url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/sv/Start/Naturvard/Skydd-av-natur/Nationalparker/|archivedate=2012-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; six more are scheduled to open by 2013.&lt;ref name="förslag2"/&gt;

According to the EPA, Swedish national parks must represent unique landscape types and be effectively protected and used for research, recreation, and tourism without damaging nature.&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Start/Naturvard/Skydd-av-natur/Nationalparker/Forslag-till-nya-nationalparker/Fakta-om-nationalparker/|title=Fakta om nationalparker|language=Swedish|publisher=Naturvårdsverket (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency)|accessdate=2011-06-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130113202619/http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Start/Naturvard/Skydd-av-natur/Nationalparker/Forslag-till-nya-nationalparker/Fakta-om-nationalparker/|archivedate=2013-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mountain terrain dominates approximatively 90% of the parks' combined area. The reason for this is the extensive mountain areas taken up by the large northern parks—[[Sarek National Park]] and [[Padjelanta National Park]] each cover approximately {{convert|200000|ha|acre|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="sarek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="padjelanta"/&gt; Many of the northern parks are part of the [[Laponian area]], one of Sweden's [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s due to its preserved natural landscape and habitat for the native [[reindeer]]-herding [[Sami people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=774|title=Laponian Area|publisher=[[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southernmost parks—[[Söderåsen National Park]], [[Dalby Söderskog National Park]] and [[Stenshuvud National Park]]—are covered with [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|broadleaf forest]] and together cover approximately {{convert|2000|ha|acre|0|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="söderåsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dalby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stenshuvud"/&gt; Fulufjället National Park is part of [[PAN Parks]],&lt;ref name="Fulufjället"/&gt; a network founded by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) to provide better long-term conservation and tourism management of European national parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panparks.org/Introduction/Vision|archive-url=https://archive.is/20030613113554/http://www.panparks.org/Introduction/Vision|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-06-13|title=Vision|publisher=PAN Parks|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, after investigations and interviews with the participating counties, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency laid down a plan to establish 13 new national parks in the near future. According to the plan, seven of the parks will be established between 2009 and 2013, the first being Kosterhavet National Park which was inaugurated in September 2009. It is currently unknown when the six remaining parks will be established.&lt;ref name="förslag2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Start/Naturvard/Skydd-av-natur/Nationalparker/Forslag-till-nya-nationalparker/Ny-nationalparksplan/|title=Ny nationalparksplan för Sverige|publisher=Naturvårdsverket (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency)|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-06-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130113233618/http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Start/Naturvard/Skydd-av-natur/Nationalparker/Forslag-till-nya-nationalparker/Ny-nationalparksplan/|archivedate=2013-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an alphabetical listing of '''wort plants''', meaning plants that employ the syllable ''wort'' in their English-language common names.

According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'s Ask Oxford site, "A word with the suffix ''-wort'' is often very old. The [[Old English]] word was ''wyrt'', from [[Proto-Indo-European]] origins that connect it to ''root''. It was often used{{By whom|date=October 2018}} in the names of [[herb]]s and [[plant]]s that had medicinal uses, the first part of the word denoting the complaint against which it might be specially efficacious. By the middle of the 17th-century ''-wort'' was beginning to fade from everyday use.&lt;ref name="askoxford"&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205000955/http://www.askoxford.com/worldofwords/wordfrom/plants/?view=print |date=February 5, 2005 |title=World of Words: A word about some useful plants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Naturalist Newsletter'' states, "''Wort'' derives from the Old English ''wyrt'', which simply meant ''plant''. The word goes back even further, to the common ancestor of English and German, to the Germanic ''wurtiz''. ''Wurtiz'' also evolved into the modern German word ''Wurzel'', meaning ''root''."&lt;ref name="natchez"&gt;[http://www.backyardnature.net/n/03/031221.htm Conrad, Jim, ''Natchez Naturalist Newsletter'', December 21, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is intended to be a comprehensive list of creatures that have appeared in various ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' works. Each individual list covers a span of years by edition of the game, with monsters being listed chronologically by book in which they appeared.

Although efforts have been made to include all creatures, there are likely to be omissions and other errors. At any particular time, there will be variations in the level of brief detail, and there are some duplications, not all of which are errors as there are some name duplications amongst the creatures.

==Original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''==
{{main|List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons monsters (1974–1976)}}
The original edition of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' consisted of a boxed set by [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]] printed in 1974, and several pamphlet-sized supplements printed through 1976. The volume "Monsters &amp; Treasure" in the original set, and the supplements (''[[Greyhawk]]'', ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' and ''[[Eldritch Wizardry]]'') included a section of monsters.

==Basic ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''==
{{main|List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons monsters (1977–1999)}}
This edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons began in 1981, as a revision of the introductory ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set]]'' established it as a separate version of the game that ran concurrently with both 1st edition and 2nd edition ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' until the line was ended in 1994. The Basic Rulebook collected many of the monsters from the previous D&amp;D supplements, and the subsequent ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set|Basic Set]]'', ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Expert Set|Expert Set]]'', ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Companion Set|Companion Set]]'', ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Master Rules|Master Set]]'', and ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Immortals Rules|Immortals Set]]'' all added more new monsters to the game. The [[Creature Catalogue]] expanded on these sets even further, collecting monsters that had appeared in basic D&amp;D modules and adding new monsters as well.

==''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 1st edition==
{{main|Index of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1st edition monsters}}
Introduced in 1977, the ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game built upon the original edition of ''D&amp;D''. This edition also introduced the concept of a ''[[Monster Manual]]'', a separate book to deal with just monsters.  The original ''Monster Manual'' collected the monsters from the original D&amp;D books, and other sources, and expanded on the monster format. The original ''Fiend Folio'' and ''Monster Manual II'' were also printed during the run of ''AD&amp;D'' 1st edition, and numerous monsters appeared in other modules and game supplements at the time.

==''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition''==
{{main|List of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition monsters}}
Initially, the 2nd edition of ''AD&amp;D'' replaced the idea of a hardbound ''Monster Manual'' with a loose-leaf ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'' series that eventually numbered 14 volumes. These volumes greatly expanded the detail level on the previous edition's monsters, and returned most of the 1st edition monsters to the game. Due to popular demand (as the format was considered too fragile and unwieldy), the ''Monstrous Compendium'' series eventually ended and was replaced with the 384-page ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993, which reprinted many of the creatures previously featured in the ''Monstrous Compendium'' series. This book was followed up by four ''Monstrous Compendium Annuals'' in the following years, and many new monsters were introduced in game modules and supplements throughout 2nd edition.

==''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd edition==
{{main|List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition monsters}}
A new ''Monster Manual'' was published in 2000 as part of the core rulebooks for ''D&amp;D'' 3rd edition. The monster format was greatly altered to match the new edition. Just like with 1st edition, this edition included a ''Fiend Folio'' and ''Monster Manual II'', and debuted many new monsters in various game supplements.

==''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3.5 edition==
{{main|List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 edition monsters}}
The version 3.5 rules included a revision of the 3rd edition ''Monster Manual'', and continued the ''Monster Manual'' series with books III-V. As with previous versions of the game, a number of new monsters debuted in a variety of game supplements in this era.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11463">[[File:Cubic phase gel.jpg|thumb|A highly viscous cubic phase gel made of [[polysorbate 80]], water, and [[Liquid paraffin (medicinal)|liquid paraffin]].]]

A [[liquid crystal]]line mesophase is called '''lyotropic''' (a [[portmanteau]] of [[wiktionary:lyo-|lyo-]] "dissolve" and [[wiktionary:-tropic|-tropic]] "change" ) if formed by dissolving an [[amphiphilic]] [[mesogen]] in a suitable solvent, under appropriate conditions of concentration, temperature and pressure.&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baron |first=M. |date= 2003 |title= Definitions of Basic Terms Relating to Low-Molar-Mass and Polymer LIQUID CRYSTALS (IUPAC Recommendations 2001) |url= |journal=[[Pure Appl. Chem.]] |volume=73|issue=5 |pages=845–895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of soap and water is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.

Historically, the term was used to describe the common behavior of materials composed of [[amphiphilic]] molecules upon the addition of a [[solvent]]. Such molecules comprise a water-loving [[hydrophilic]] head-group (which may be ionic or non-ionic) attached to a water-hating, [[hydrophobic]] group.

The micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale results in different type of solvent-induced extended anisotropic&lt;ref name=Lagerwall&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lagerwall |first=Jan P.F. |last2= Giesselmann |first2= Frank |date= 2006 |title= Current Topics in Smectic Liquid Crystal Research |url= |journal=[[ChemPhysChem]] |volume=7 |issue= |pages= 20–45 |doi= 10.1002/cphc.200500472}}&lt;/ref&gt; arrangement, depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. In turn, they generate the long-range order of the phases, with the [[solvent]] molecules filling the space around the compounds to provide [[viscosity|fluidity]] to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Qizhen Liang |author2=Pengtao Liu |author3=Cheng Liu |author4=Xigao Jian |author5=Dingyi Hong |author6=Yang Li. |date= 2005|title= Synthesis and Properties of Lyotropic Liquid Crystalline Copolyamides Containing Phthalazinone Moieties and Ether Linkages|journal= Polymer|volume=46 |issue= 16|pages= 6258–6265|doi= 10.1016/j.polymer.2005.05.059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to thermotropic liquid crystals, lyotropics liquid crystals have therefore an additional degree of freedom, that is the concentration that enables them to induce a variety of different phases. As the concentration of amphiphilic molecules is increased, several different type of lyotropic liquid crystal structures occur in solution. Each of these different types has a different extent of molecular ordering within the solvent matrix, from spherical micelles to larger cylinders, aligned cylinders and even bilayered and multiwalled aggregates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2006|pp=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of lyotropic systems==
Examples of amphiphilic compounds are the salts of fatty acids, [[phospholipids]]. Many simple amphiphiles are used as [[detergents]].  A mixture of soap and water is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.

Biological structures such as fibrous proteins showings relatively long and well-defined hydrophobic and hydrophilic ‘‘blocks’’ of [[aminoacids]] can also show lyotropic liquid crystalline behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2006|pp=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amphiphile self-assembly ==
A typical amphiphilic flexible surfactant can form aggregates through a self-assembly process that results of specific interactions between the molecules of the amphiphilic mesogen and those of the non-mesogenic solvent.

In aqueous media, the driving force of the aggregation is the "[[hydrophobic effect]]". The aggregates formed by amphiphilic molecules are characterised by structures in which the hydrophilic head-groups  expose their surface to aqueous solution, shielding the hydrophobic chains from contact with water.

For most lyotropic systems aggregation occurs only when the concentration of the amphiphile exceeds a critical concentration (known variously as the [[critical micelle concentration]] (CMC) or the [[critical aggregation concentration (CAC)]]).

At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, above the CMC, self-assembled amphiphile aggregates exist as independent entities in equilibrium with monomeric amphiphiles in solution, but with no long ranged orientational or positional (translational) order. As a result, phases are [[isotropic]] (i.e. not liquid crystalline). These dispersions are generally referred to as '[[micellar solutions]]', often denoted by the symbol L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, while the constituent spherical aggregates are known as '[[micelles]]'.

At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. True lyotropic liquid crystalline phases are formed as the concentration of amphiphile in water is increased beyond the point where the micellar aggregates are forced to be disposed regularly in space. For amphiphiles that consist of a single hydrocarbon chain the concentration at which the first liquid crystalline phases are formed is typically in the range 25–30 wt%.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Liquid crystalline phases and composition/temperature==
The simplest liquid crystalline phase that is formed by spherical micelles is the '[[micellar cubic]]', denoted by the symbol I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is a highly viscous, optically isotropic phase in which the micelles are arranged on a cubic lattice. At higher amphiphile concentrations the micelles fuse to form cylindrical aggregates of indefinite length, and these cylinders are arranged on a long-ranged hexagonal lattice. This lyotropic liquid crystalline phase is known as the '[[hexagonal phase]]', or more specifically the '[[normal topology]]' hexagonal phase and is generally denoted by the symbol H&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;.

At higher concentrations of amphiphile the '[[lamellar phase]]' is formed. This phase is denoted by the symbol L&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and can be considered the lyotropic equivalent of a smectic A mesophase.&lt;ref name=Baron/&gt; This phase consists of amphiphilic molecules arranged in bilayer sheers separated by layers of water. Each bilayer is a prototype of the arrangement of [[lipids]] in cell membranes.

For most amphiphiles that consist of a single hydrocarbon chain, one or more phases having complex architectures are formed at concentrations that are intermediate between those required to form a hexagonal phase and those that lead to the formation of a lamellar phase. Often this intermediate phase is a [[bicontinuous cubic phase]].

In principle, increasing the amphiphile concentration beyond the point where lamellar phases are formed would lead to the formation of the [[inverse topology]] lyotropic phases, namely the inverse cubic phases, the inverse hexagonal columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles, (H&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;) and the inverse micellar cubic phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities). In practice inverse topology phases are more readily formed by amphiphiles that have at least two hyrocarbon chains attached to a headgroup. The most abundant phospholipids that are found in cell membranes of mammalian cells are examples of amphiphiles that readily form inverse topology lyotropic phases.

Even within the same phases, self-assembled structures are tunable by the concentration: For example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.

The objects created by the amphiphiles are usually spherical (as in the case of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These anisotropic self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).

== Host molecules ==

It is possible that specific molecules are dissolved in lyotropic mesophases, where they can be located mainly inside, outside, or at the surface of the aggregates.

Some of such molecules act as dopants, inducing specific properties to the whole phase, other ones can be considered simple guests with limited effect on the surrounding environment but possibly strong consequences on their physico-chemical properties, and some of them are used as probe to detect molecular-level properties of the whole mesophase in specific analytical techniques.&lt;ref name=Domenici&gt;{{cite journal |last=Domenici |first= Valentina |last2=Marchetti |first2= Alessandro |last3= Cifelli |first3=Mario |last4= Veracini |first4=Carlo Alberto |date= 2009 |title= Dynamics of Partially Oriented L-Phenylalanine-d8 in the CsPFO/H2O Lyotropic System via 2H NMR Relaxation Studies |url= |journal= [[Langmuir (journal)|Langmuir]] |volume=25 |issue=23  |pages=13581–13590 |doi= 10.1021/la901917m }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rod-like macromolecules ==
The term lyotropic has also been applied to the liquid crystalline [[phase (matter)|phases]] that are formed by certain polymeric materials, particularly those consisting of rigid rod-like macromolecules, when they are mixed with appropriate solvents. Examples are [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of rod-like [[virus]]es such as the [[Tobacco Mosaic Virus]] as well as man-made [[colloid]]al suspensions of non-spherical colloidal particles. Other examples include [[DNA]] and [[Kevlar]], which dissolve in [[sulfuric acid]] to give a lyotropic phase. It is noted that in these cases the solvent acts to lower the melting point of the materials thereby enabling the liquid crystalline phases to be accessible. These liquid crystalline phases are closer in architecture to [[thermotropic]] liquid crystalline phases than to the conventional lyotropic phases. In contrast to the behaviour of amphiphilic molecules, the lyotropic behaviour of the rod-like molecules does not involve [[self-assembly]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Two separatrices (see text) divide space into four magnetic domains with a separator at the center of the figure. Field lines (and associated plasma) flow inward from above and below the separator, reconnect, and spring outward horizontally. A current sheet (as shown) may be present but is not required for reconnection to occur. This process is not well understood: once started, it proceeds many orders of magnitude faster than predicted by standard models.]]

[[File:Quad-flare.ogv|thumb|380px|The evolution of magnetic reconnection during a [[solar flare]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhu et al., 2016, ApJ, 821, L29, http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/821/2/L29&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Magnetic reconnection''' is a physical process occurring in highly conducting [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] in which the magnetic [[topology]] is rearranged and magnetic energy is converted to [[kinetic energy]], [[thermal energy]], and [[particle acceleration]].  Magnetic reconnection occurs on timescales intermediate between slow resistive diffusion of the [[magnetic field]] and fast [[Alfvén wave|Alfvénic]] timescales.

According to simple resistive [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD) theory, reconnection happens because the plasma's [[resistivity|electrical resistivity]] near the boundary layer opposes the [[current (electricity)|current]]s necessary to sustain the change in the magnetic field.  The need for such a current can be seen from one of [[Maxwell's equations]],

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu \mathbf{J} + \mu \epsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The resistivity of the current layer allows [[magnetic flux]] from either side to diffuse through the current layer, cancelling outflux from the other side of the boundary.  When this happens, the plasma is pulled out by [[Magnetic tension force|magnetic tension]] along the direction of the magnetic field lines.  The resulting drop in pressure pulls more plasma and magnetic flux into the central region, yielding a self-sustaining process.

A current problem in plasma [[physics]] is that observed reconnection happens much faster than predicted by MHD in high [[Lundquist number]] plasmas (i.e. '''fast magnetic reconnection'''). [[Solar flare|Solar flares]], for example, proceed 13-14 orders of magnitude faster than a naive calculation would suggest, and several orders of magnitude faster than current theoretical models that include turbulence and kinetic effects.  One possible mechanism to explain the discrepancy is that the electromagnetic [[turbulence]] in the boundary layer is sufficiently strong to scatter electrons, raising the plasma's local resistivity.  This would allow the magnetic flux to diffuse faster.

=== Physical interpretation ===
The qualitative description of the reconnection process is such that [[magnetic field lines]] from different [[magnetic domain]]s (defined by the field line connectivity) are spliced to one another, changing their patterns of connectivity with respect to the sources.  It is a violation of an approximate conservation law in plasma physics, called the [[Alfvén's Theorem]], and can concentrate mechanical or magnetic energy in both space and time. Solar flares, the largest explosions in the [[Solar System]], may involve the reconnection of large systems of magnetic flux on the [[Sun]], releasing, in minutes, energy that has been stored in the magnetic field over a period of hours to days.  Magnetic reconnection in [[Earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]] is one of the mechanisms responsible for the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]], and it is important to the science of controlled [[nuclear fusion]] because it is one mechanism preventing [[magnetic confinement]] of the fusion fuel.

In an electrically conductive [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], magnetic field lines are grouped into 'domains'— bundles of field lines that connect from a particular place to another particular place, and that are topologically distinct from other field lines nearby.  This topology is approximately preserved even when the magnetic field itself is strongly distorted by the presence of variable currents or motion of magnetic sources, because effects that might otherwise change the magnetic topology instead induce [[eddy current]]s in the plasma; the eddy currents have the effect of canceling out the topological change.

=== Types of reconnection ===
In two dimensions, the most common type of magnetic reconnection is '''separator reconnection''', in which four separate magnetic domains exchange magnetic field lines.  Domains in a magnetic plasma are separated by ''[[Separatrix (Math)|separatrix]] surfaces'': curved surfaces in space that divide different bundles of flux. Field lines on one side of the separatrix all terminate at a particular magnetic pole, while field lines on the other side all terminate at a different pole of similar sign.  Since each field line generally begins at a north magnetic pole and ends at a south magnetic pole, the most general way of dividing simple flux systems involves four domains separated by two separatrices: one separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a south pole, and the other separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a north pole.  The intersection of the separatrices forms a ''separator'', a single line that is at the boundary of the four separate domains.  In separator reconnection, field lines enter the separator from two of the domains, and are spliced one to the other, exiting the separator in the other two domains (see the first figure).

==Theoretical descriptions==

===Slow reconnection: Sweet–Parker model===
The first theoretical framework of magnetic reconnection was established by [[Peter Alan Sweet|Peter Sweet]] and [[Eugene Parker]] at a conference in 1956. Sweet pointed out that by pushing two plasmas with oppositely directed magnetic fields together, resistive diffusion is able to occur on a length scale much shorter than a typical equilibrium length scale.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, P. A., The Neutral Point Theory of Solar Flares, in IAU Symposium 6, Electromagnetic Phenomena in Cosmical Physics, ed. B. Lehnert (Dordrecht: Kluwer), 123, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; Parker was in attendance at this conference and developed scaling relations for this model during his return travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=E. N.|date=December 1957|title=Sweet's mechanism for merging magnetic fields in conducting fluids|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=62|issue=4|pages=509–520|doi=10.1029/JZ062i004p00509|bibcode=1957JGR....62..509P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sweet-Parker model describes time-independent magnetic reconnection in the resistive MHD framework when the reconnecting magnetic fields are antiparallel (oppositely directed) and effects related to viscosity and compressibility are unimportant.  The initial velocity is simply an &lt;math&gt;E\times B&lt;/math&gt; velocity, so
: &lt;math&gt; E_y = v_{in} B_{in} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt; is the out-of-plane electric field, &lt;math&gt;v_{in}&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic inflow velocity, and &lt;math&gt;B_{in}&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic upstream magnetic field strength.  By neglecting displacement current, the low-frequency Ampere's law, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \frac{\nabla\times\mathbf{B}}{\mu_0}&lt;/math&gt;, gives the relation
: &lt;math&gt; J_y \sim \frac{B_{in}}{\mu_0\delta}, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the current sheet half-thickness.  This relation uses that the magnetic field reverses over a distance of &lt;math&gt;\sim2\delta&lt;/math&gt;.  By matching the ideal electric field outside of the layer with the resistive electric field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}=\frac{1}{\sigma}\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; inside the layer (using [[Ohm's law]]), we find that
: &lt;math&gt;v_{in} =\frac{E_y}{B_{in}} \sim \frac{1}{\mu_0\sigma\delta} = \frac{\eta}{\delta},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic diffusivity]].  When the inflow density is comparable to the outflow density, conservation of mass yields the relationship
: &lt;math&gt;v_{in}L \sim v_{out}\delta, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the half-length of the current sheet and &lt;math&gt;v_{out}&lt;/math&gt; is the outflow velocity.  The left and right hand sides of the above relation represent the mass flux into the layer and out of the layer, respectively.  Equating the upstream magnetic pressure with the downstream [[dynamic pressure]] gives
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{B_{in}^2}{2\mu_0} \sim \frac{\rho v_{out}^2}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density of the plasma.  Solving for the outflow velocity then gives
: &lt;math&gt; v_{out} \sim \frac{B_{in}}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \rho}} \equiv v_A &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Alfvén wave|Alfvén velocity]].  With the above relations, the dimensionless reconnection rate &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can then be written in two forms, the first in terms of &lt;math&gt;(\eta, \delta, v_A)&lt;/math&gt; using the result earlier derived from Ohm's law, the second in terms of &lt;math&gt;(\delta,L)&lt;/math&gt; from the conservation of mass as
: &lt;math&gt; R= \frac{v_{in}}{v_{out}} \sim \frac{\eta}{v_A\delta} \sim \frac{\delta}{L}. &lt;/math&gt;
Since the dimensionless [[Lundquist number]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is given by
: &lt;math&gt; S \equiv \frac{L v_A}{\eta}, &lt;/math&gt;
the two different expressions of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are multiplied by each other and then square-rooted, giving a simple relation between the reconnection rate &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and the Lundquist number &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; R ~ \sim \sqrt{\frac{\eta}{v_A L}} = \frac{1}{S^{1/2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Sweet-Parker reconnection allows for reconnection rates much faster than global diffusion, but is not able to explain the fast reconnection rates observed in solar flares, the Earth's magnetosphere, and laboratory plasmas.  Additionally, Sweet-Parker reconnection neglects three-dimensional effects, collisionless physics, time-dependent effects, viscosity, compressibility, and downstream pressure.  Numerical simulations of two-dimensional magnetic reconnection typically show agreement with this model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biskamp|first=D.|date=1986|title=Magnetic reconnection via current sheets|journal=Physics of Fluids|language=en|volume=29|issue=5|pages=1520|doi=10.1063/1.865670|issn=0031-9171|bibcode=1986PhFl...29.1520B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results from the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) of collisional reconnection show agreement with a generalized Sweet-Parker model which incorporates compressibility, downstream pressure and anomalous resistivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Hantao|last2=Yamada|first2=Masaaki|last3=Hsu|first3=Scott|last4=Kulsrud|first4=Russell|last5=Carter|first5=Troy|last6=Zaharia|first6=Sorin|date=26 April 1999|title=Magnetic reconnection with Sweet-Parker characteristics in two-dimensional laboratory plasmas|journal=Physics of Plasmas|language=en|volume=6|issue=5|pages=1743–1750|doi=10.1063/1.873432|issn=1070-664X|bibcode=1999PhPl....6.1743J|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc681346/|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Hantao|last2=Yamada|first2=Masaaki|last3=Hsu|first3=Scott|last4=Kulsrud|first4=Russell|date=1998|title=Experimental Test of the Sweet-Parker Model of Magnetic Reconnection|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=80|issue=15|pages=3256–3259|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.3256|bibcode=1998PhRvL..80.3256J|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc675424/|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fast reconnection: Petschek model===

One of the reasons why Sweet-Parker reconnection is slow is that the aspect ratio of the reconnection layer is very large in high Lundquist number plasmas.  The inflow velocity, and thus the reconnection rate, must then be very small.  In 1964, Harry Petschek proposed a mechanism where the inflow and outflow regions are separated by stationary slow mode shocks.&lt;ref&gt;Petschek, H. E., Magnetic Field Annihilation, in The Physics of Solar Flares, Proceedings of the AAS-NASA Symposium held 28–30 October 1963 at the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, p. 425, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;  The aspect ratio of the diffusion region is then of order unity and the maximum reconnection rate becomes
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{v_{in}}{v_A} \approx \frac{\pi}{8 \ln S}. &lt;/math&gt;

This expression allows for fast reconnection and is almost independent of the Lundquist number.

Simulations of resistive MHD reconnection with uniform resistivity showed the development of elongated current sheets in agreement with the Sweet-Parker model rather than the Petschek model.  When a localized anomalously large resistivity is used, however, Petschek reconnection can be realized in resistive MHD simulations.  Because the use of an anomalous resistivity is only appropriate when the particle mean free path is large compared to the reconnection layer, it is likely that other collisionless effects become important before Petschek reconnection can be realized.

===Anomalous resistivity and Bohm diffusion===

In the Sweet-Parker model, the common assumption is that the [[magnetic diffusivity]] is constant. This can be estimated using the equation of motion for an electron with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;and electric charge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; {d{\mathbf{v}} \over dt}={e\over m} {\mathbf{E}}-\nu {\mathbf{v}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the collision frequency. Since in the steady state, &lt;math&gt;  d{\mathbf{v}} /dt=0 &lt;/math&gt;, then the above equation along with the definition of electric current, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{J}}=en{\mathbf{v}} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n &lt;/math&gt; is the electron number density, yields

:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\nu {c^2\over \omega_{pi}^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Nevertheless, if the drift velocity of electrons exceeds the thermal velocity of plasma, a steady state cannot be achieved and magnetic diffusivity should be much larger than what is given in the above. This is called anomalous resistivity, &lt;math&gt;\eta_{anom}&lt;/math&gt;, which can enhance the reconnection rate in the Sweet-Parker model by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\eta_{anom}/\eta&lt;/math&gt;.

Another proposed mechanism is known as the Bohm diffusion across the magnetic field. This replaces the Ohmic resistivity with &lt;math&gt;v_A^2 ( mc/ eB ) &lt;/math&gt;, however, its effect, similar to the anomalous resistivity, is still too small compared with the observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=E. G.|title=Cosmical Magnetic Fields|date=1979|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stochastic reconnection===

Lazarian and [[Ethan Vishniac|Vishniac]] (1999) considered the magnetic reconnection in the presence of a random component of magnetic field in a totally ionized and inviscid plasma assuming that the resistive effects could be described with an Ohmic resistivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazarian|first1=Alex|last2=Vishniac|first2=Ethan|title=Reconnection in a Weakly Stochastic Field|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1999|volume=517|issue=2|pages=700–718|doi=10.1086/307233|arxiv = astro-ph/9811037 |bibcode = 1999ApJ...517..700L }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the turbulent flow in the reconnection region, a model for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence should be used such as the model developed by Goldreich and Sridhar in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldreich|first1=P.|last2=Sridhar|first2=S.|title=Toward a theory of interstellar turbulence. 2: Strong alfvenic turbulence|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1995|volume=438|page=763|doi=10.1086/175121|bibcode = 1995ApJ...438..763G }}&lt;/ref&gt; One can imagine that within small scales of the turbulent flow, the Sweet-Parker model is applicable. Lazarian and Vishniac showed that, in general, this cannot affect the final result. In fact, their model is independent of small scale physics which determines the local reconnection rate. According to this model, for a current sheet of the length &lt;math&gt;L &lt;/math&gt;, the upper limit for reconnection velocity is given by

:&lt;math&gt; v=v_{turb} \; min \Big[ \Big( {L\over l} \Big)^{1/2}, \Big( {l\over L} \Big)^{1/2} \Big], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; v_{turb}= v_l^2/v_A&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;l &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; v_l &lt;/math&gt;are turbulence injection length scale and velocity respectively and &lt;math&gt;v_A &lt;/math&gt;is the Alfvén velocity.  This model has been successfully tested by numerical simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kowal|first1=G.|last2=Lazarian|first2=A.|last3=Vishniac|first3=E.|last4=Otmianowska-Mazur|first4=K.|title=NUMERICAL TESTS OF FAST RECONNECTION IN WEAKLY STOCHASTIC MAGNETIC FIELDS|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|year=2009|volume=700|issue=1|pages=63–85|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/700/1/63|arxiv = 0903.2052 |bibcode = 2009ApJ...700...63K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kowal|first1=G|last2=Lazarian|first2=A.|last3=Vishniac|first3=E.|last4=Otmianowska-Mazur|first4=K.|title=Reconnection studies under different types of turbulence driving|journal=Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics|date=2012|volume=19|issue=2|pages=297–314|doi=10.5194/npg-19-297-2012|arxiv = 1203.2971 |bibcode = 2012NPGeo..19..297K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-MHD process: Collisionless reconnection===

On length scales shorter than the ion inertial length &lt;math&gt;c/\omega_{pi}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\omega_{pi}\equiv \sqrt{\frac{n_iZ^2e^2}{\epsilon_0m_i}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ion plasma frequency), [[ion]]s decouple from electrons and the magnetic field becomes frozen into the electron fluid rather than the bulk plasma.  On these scales, the [[Hall effect]] becomes important.  Two-fluid simulations show the formation of an X-point geometry rather than the double Y-point geometry characteristic of resistive reconnection.  The [[electron]]s are then accelerated to very high speeds by [[Electromagnetic electron wave|Whistler waves]].  Because the ions can move through a wider "bottleneck" near the current layer and because the electrons are moving much faster in Hall MHD than in [[Magnetohydrodynamics|standard MHD]], reconnection may proceed more quickly.  Two-fluid/collisionless reconnection is particularly important in the Earth's magnetosphere.

== Observations of magnetic reconnection in nature and the laboratory ==

===Solar atmosphere===

Magnetic reconnection occurs during [[solar flare]]s, [[coronal mass ejection]]s, and many other events in the solar atmosphere.  The observational evidence for solar flares includes observations of inflows/outflows, downflowing loops, and changes in the magnetic topology. In the past, observations of the solar atmosphere were done using remote imaging; consequently, the magnetic fields were inferred or extrapolated rather than observed directly. However, the first direct observations of solar magnetic reconnection were gathered in 2012 (and released in 2013) by the [[High Resolution Coronal Imager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azonano.com/news.aspx?newsID=26419|title=High-Resolution Coronal Imager Photographs the Sun in UV Light at 19.3nm Wavelength|publisher=AZonano.com|date=January 24, 2013|accessdate= February 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth's magnetosphere===

Magnetic reconnection events that occur in the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] (in the dayside [[magnetopause]] and in the [[magnetotail]]) were observed by spacecrafts such as [[Cluster mission|Cluster II]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://clusterlaunch.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=8 Articles on measurements made from the Cluster II spacecraft mission]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burch|first=J.

It has observed numerous reconnection events in which the Earth's magnetic field reconnects with that of the Sun (i.e. the [[Interplanetary Magnetic Field]]). These include 'reverse reconnection' that causes sunward convection in the Earth's [[ionosphere]] near the polar cusps; 'dayside reconnection', which allows the transmission of particles and energy into the Earth's vicinity and 'tail reconnection', which causes auroral [[substorm]]s by injecting particles deep into the magnetosphere and releasing the energy stored in the Earth's magnetotail.  The [[Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission]], launched on 13 March 2015, improved the spatial and temporal resolution of the Cluster II results by having a tighter constellation of spacecraft. This led to a better understanding of the behavior of the electrical currents in the electron diffusion region.

On 26 February 2008, [[THEMIS]] probes were able to determine the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html|title=THEMIS Satellites Discover What Triggers Eruptions of the Northern Lights|website=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the Moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to Auroral intensification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1160495|title=Tail Reconnection Triggering Substorm Onset|author=Vassilis Angelopoulos|doi=10.1126/science.1160495|pmid=18653845|volume=321|issue=5891|pages=931–935|journal=Science|bibcode = 2008Sci...321..931A |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Vassilis Angelopoulos of the University of California, Los Angeles, who is the principal investigator for the THEMIS mission, claimed, "Our data show clearly and for the first time that magnetic reconnection is the trigger.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/080724-themis-aurora-mystery.html|title=Secret of Colorful Auroras Revealed|website=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory plasma experiments===

Magnetic reconnection have also been observed in numerous laboratory experiments. For example, studies on the [[Large Plasma Device|LArge Plasma Device (LAPD)]] at UCLA have observed and mapped quasi-sepratrix layers near the magnetic reconnection region of a two [[Flux tube|flux rope]] system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Eric E.|last2=Gekelman|first2=W|date=2009|title=Identification of a Quasiseparatrix Layer in a Reconnecting Laboratory Magnetoplasma|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=103|issue=10|pages=105002|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.105002|pmid=19792321|bibcode=2009PhRvL.103j5002L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gekelman|first=W|last2=Lawrence|first2=E|last3=Collette|first3=A|last4=Vincena|first4=S|last5=Compernolle|first5=B Van|last6=Pribyl|first6=P|last7=Berger|first7=M|last8=Campbell|first8=J|date=2010-12-01|title=Magnetic field line reconnection in the current systems of flux ropes and Alfvén waves|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1402-4896/2010/i=T142/a=014032?key=crossref.62cde24c54eea472db070b44354ecc1b|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=T142|pages=014032|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014032|issn=0031-8949|via=|bibcode=2010PhST..142a4032G}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while experiments on the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have confirmed many aspects of magnetic reconnection, including the Sweet-Parker model in regimes where the model is applicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ji|first=H.|display-authors=etal|title=Magnetic reconnection with Sweet-Parker characteristics in two-dimensional laboratory plasmas|journal=Physics of Plasmas|date=May 1999|volume=6|issue=5|pages=1743–1750|doi=10.1063/1.873432|bibcode = 1999PhPl....6.1743J |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc681346/m2/1/high_res_d/3001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The confinement of plasma in devices such as [[tokamak]]s, [[spherical tokamak]]s, and [[reversed field pinch]]es requires the presence of closed magnetic flux surfaces.  By changing the magnetic topology, magnetic reconnection degrades confinement by disrupting these closed flux surfaces, allowing the hot central plasma to mix with cooler plasma closer to the wall.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a toxic heavy metal which cycles through atmosphere, water, and soil in various forms to different parts
of the world. Due to this natural cycle, irrespective of which part of the world releases mercury it could affect an entirely different part of the world making mercury pollution a global concern. Mercury pollution is now identified as a global problem and awareness has been raised on an international action plan to minimize anthropogenic mercury emissions and clean up mercury pollution. The 2002 Global Mercury Assessment concluded that "International actions to address the global mercury problem should not be delayed”.&lt;ref&gt;1.

== Sources==
Mercury release occurs by both natural and anthropogenic processes. Natural processes are mainly geogenic such as volcanic activities and land emissions through soil. Volcanoes release mercury from the underground reservoirs upon eruption. Land emissions are usually observed in the regions closer to plate tectonic boundaries where soils are enriched with minerals such as cinnabar containing [[Mercury sulfide]](HgS). This mercury is released by either natural weathering of the rocks or by geothermal reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Selin, N.E.; Global Biogeochemical Cycling of Mercury: A Review. Annu. Rev. Environ. Resour. 2009, 34, 43 – 63&lt;/ref&gt; While natural phenomena account for a certain percentage of present-day emissions, anthropogenic emissions alone have increased mercury concentration in the environment by threefold.&lt;ref name="ME2013"&gt;United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Global Mercury Assessment: Sources, Emissions, Releases and Environmental Transport (Geneva,2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Global Mercury Assessment 2013 states main anthropogenic sources of mercury emission are artisanal and small - scale gold mining, fossil fuel burning and primary production of non-ferrous metals. Other sources such as cement production, consumer products waste, contaminated sites and chlor-alkali industry also contributes in relatively small percentages.&lt;ref name="ME2013" /&gt;

Mercury enters the ocean in different ways. Atmospheric deposition is the largest source of mercury to the oceans. Atmospheric deposition introduces three types of mercury to the ocean. Gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) enters the ocean through air-water exchange. Inorganic mercury (Hg2+/HgII) and particle-bound mercury (Hg(P)) enters through wet and dry deposition. In addition, mercury enters the ocean via rivers, estuaries, sediments, and, hydrothermal vents etc.&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;Mason, R.P.; Choi, A.L.; Fitzgerald, W.F.; Hammerschmidt, C.R.; Lamborg, C.H.; Soerensen, A.L.; Sunderland, E.M. Mercury biogeochemical cycling in the ocean and policy implications. Environ. Res. 2012, 119, 101 -117&lt;/ref&gt; These sources also release organic mercury compounds such as [[Methyl mercury]]. Once they are in the ocean they can undergo many reactions primarily grouped as; redox reactions (gain or loss of electrons), adsorption processes (binding to solid particles), methylation and demethylation (addition or removal of a methyl group).&lt;ref name=Batrakova2014 /&gt;

===Sedimentary Mercury===
Mercury can enter seas and the open ocean as a result of the down-stream movement and re-deposition of contaminated sediments from urban [[estuaries]].&lt;ref name="VaneJones2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vane|first1=C.H.|last2=Jones|first2=D.G.|last3=Lister|first3=T.R.|title=Mercury contamination in surface sediments and sediment cores of the Mersey Estuary, UK|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=58|issue=6|year=2009|pages=940–946|issn=0025-326X|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2009.03.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, high total Hg content up to 5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg and averaging about 2&amp;nbsp;mg/kg occur in the surface sediments and sediment cores of the tidal [[River Mersey]], UK, due to discharge from historical industries located along the banks of the tidal river including industries such as historical chlor-alkali industry.&lt;ref name="VaneJones2009"/&gt; Sediments along a 100&amp;nbsp;km stretch of the [[Thames Estuary]] have also been shown to have total Hg contents of up to 12&amp;nbsp;mg/kg and a mean of 2&amp;nbsp;mg/kg with the highest concentrations found at depth in and around London.&lt;ref name="VaneBeriro2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vane|first1=Christopher H.|last2=Beriro|first2=Darren J.|last3=Turner|first3=Grenville H.|title=Rise and fall of mercury (Hg) pollution in sediment cores of the Thames Estuary, London, UK|journal=Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|volume=105|issue=04|year=2015|pages=285–296|issn=1755-6910|doi=10.1017/S1755691015000158}}&lt;/ref&gt; A gradual and statistically significant decrease in sedimentary Hg content occurs in the Thames as a results of greater distance from the historical and current point-sources, sorption and in-river deposition in the mud reaches  as well as dilution by marine sands from the Southern [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name="VaneBeriro2015"/&gt; In contrast sediments entering the ocean from the marsh creeks of East Coast USA and [[mangroves]] fringing the [[South China Sea]] generally have moderate sedimentary Hg (&lt;0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg).&lt;ref name="VaneHarrison2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vane|first1=C.H.|last2=Harrison|first2=I.|last3=Kim|first3=A.W.|last4=Moss-Hayes|first4=V.|last5=Vickers|first5=B.P.|last6=Horton|first6=B.P.|title=Status of organic pollutants in surface sediments of Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor Estuary, New Jersey, USA|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=56|issue=10|year=2008|pages=1802–1808|issn=0025-326X|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2008.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VaneHarrison2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vane|first1=C.H.|last2=Harrison|first2=I.|last3=Kim|first3=A.W.|last4=Moss-Hayes|first4=V.|last5=Vickers|first5=B.P.|last6=Hong|first6=K.|title=Organic and metal contamination in surface mangrove sediments of South China|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=58|issue=1|year=2009|pages=134–144|issn=0025-326X|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2008.09.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Microbialmercurychemistry.jpg|thumb|260px|right|{{center|Microbial chemical conversions of mercury}}]]

Reduction and oxidation of mercury mostly occur closer to the ocean water surface. These are either driven by sunlight or by microbial activity. Under UV radiation, elemental mercury oxidizes and dissolves directly in ocean water or binds to other particles. The reverse reaction reduces some mercury Hg2+ to elemental mercury Hg(0) and returns to the atmosphere. Fine aerosols in the atmosphere such as ocean water droplets can act as small reaction chambers in this process providing the special reaction conditions required. Oxidation and reduction of mercury in the ocean are not very simple reversible reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Qureshi,A.; O’Driscoll, N.J.; MacLeod, M.; Neuhold,Y.M.; Hungerbuhler,K. Photoreactions of mercury in surface ocean water: Gross reaction kinetics and possible pathways. Environ. Sci. Technol., 2010, 44 (2), 644 – 649&lt;/ref&gt; Shown below is the proposed pathway of ocean aerosol mercuric photochemistry suggesting that it occurs through a reactive intermediate:

Photo oxidation is suspected to be driven by OH. radical and reduction is driven by wind and surface layer disturbances. In the dark, mercury redox reactions continue due to microbial activity. The biological transformations are different and have a smaller rate compared to sunlight driven processes above.&lt;ref name=Batrakova2014 /&gt; Inorganic mercury Hg2+ and methyl mercury has the ability to get adsorbed in to particles. A positive correlation of binding is observed for the amount of organic matter vs. the concentration of these mercury species showing that most of them bind to organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;13.  Boszke, L.; Glosinska, G.; Siepak, J.; Some aspects of speciation of mercury in a water environment. Pol. J. Environ. Stud. 2002, 11 (4), 285 – 298&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can determine the bioavailability and toxicity of mercury in the ocean. Some methyl mercury is released to the ocean through river run-off. However, most of the methyl mercury found in the ocean is produced in –situ (inside the ocean itself).&lt;ref name="mason" /&gt; 
Methylation of inorganic mercury can occur via biotic and abiotic pathways. However, biotic pathways are more predominant. The reactions illustrated in a simplified scheme below are actually parts of complex enzyme driven metabolic pathways taking place inside microbial cells.

In abiotic reactions, humic substances act as methylating agents and therefore this process occur at shallow sea levels where decomposing organic matter is available to combine with inorganic mercury Hg2+.9 Mercury methylation studies in Polar Regions have also shown a positive correlation between methylation and chlorophyll content in water showing there could also be biogenic pathways for methyl mercury production.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, J.L.; Lehnherr, I.; Anderson, M.; Braune, B.M.; Chan, L.; Dastoor, A.P.; Dunford, D.; Gleason, A.L.; Loseto, L.L.; Steffen, A.; St Louis, V.L.; Mercury in arctic marine ecosystems: sources, pathways and exposure. Environ. Res. 2012, 119, 64 -87 Dimethyl mercury degradation also produces some of the methyl mercury present ocean.&lt;/ref&gt; Produced methyl mercury gets accumulated in microbes. Due to the high permeability and absence of degradation for methyl mercury in other species that depend on those microbes, this very toxic compound gets biomagnified through marine food chains to the top predators. Human population consumes many types of marine fish who are top predators in the food chains which puts their health in great danger. Therefore, finding possible solutions to minimize further mercury emissions and cleaning up the already existing mercury pollution is extremely important.

== Health risks ==
Oceanic mercury pollution presents a serious threat to human health. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) states that mercury consumption by people of all ages can result in loss of peripheral vision, weakened muscles, impairment of hearing and speech, and deteriorated movement coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/mercury/health-effects-exposures-mercury|title=Health Effects of Exposures to Mercury|last=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|first=|date=|website=EPA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants and developing children face even more serious health risks because mercury exposure inhibits proper brain and nervous system development, damaging memory, cognitive thinking, language abilities, attention, and fine motor skills. The case of [[Minamata disease]] that occurred in [[Minamata Bay]], Japan in the 1950s demonstrated the frightening effects of exposure to extremely high concentrations of mercury.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harada|first=Masazumi|date=1995|title=Minamata Disease: Methylmercury Poisoning in Japan Caused by Environmental Pollution|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408449509089885|journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology|volume=25:1|pages=1–24|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult patients experienced extreme salivation, limb deformity, and irreversible [[dysarthria]] and intelligence loss. In children and fetuses (exposed to mercury through the mother's consumption of contaminated seafood), extensive [[brain lesion]]s were observed and the patients experienced more serious effects like [[cerebral palsy]], [[Mental Retardation|mental retardation]], and primitive reflexes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckers, F.|first=Rinklebe, J.|date=2017|title=Cycling of mercury in the environment: Sources, fate, and human health implications: A review|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10643389.2017.1326277?journalCode=best20|journal=Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology|volume=47:9|pages=693–794|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid the toxic effects of mercury exposure, the United States EPA advises a mercury dose limit of 0.1&amp;nbsp;µg/kg/day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to human health, animal health is also seriously threatened by mercury pollution in the ocean.  The effects of high mercury levels on animal health were revealed by the severe mercury poisoning in Minamata Bay in which many animals exhibited extremely strange behaviors and high mortality rates after consuming contaminated seafood or absorbing mercury from the seawater. The cat population essentially disappeared due to cats drowning in the ocean and simply collapsing dead and it became commonplace to witness birds falling out of the sky and fish swimming in circles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Low concentrations of mercury compounds were also found to cause irreparable damage to organisms in a study that subjected [[zebrafish]] to low levels of methyl mercury and [[Mercuric Chloride|mercuric chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=1. Abbott L.C., Moussa E.A.M., Carl T.L., Cortez D., Clayton H.L., et al.|first=|date=2017|title=Early Exposure to Mercuric Chloride or Methylmercury Alters Zebrafish Embryo (Danio rerio) Development|url=https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/early-exposure-to-mercuric-chloride-or-methylmercury-alters-zebrafishembryo-danio-rerio-development-2375-446X-1000178.php?aid=90607|journal=Poultry, Fisheries, and Wildlife Sciences|volume=5:1|pages=178|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zebrafish experienced a 100% mortality rate after 24 hour exposure to a mercuric chloride concentration of 1000&amp;nbsp;µg/L and a methylmercury concentration of just 100&amp;nbsp;µg/L. Additionally, both mercury species generated a decreased hatch rate, tail deformity, and diminished tail movement ability. The fact that even low concentrations of mercury compounds can cause irreparable damage to organisms displays the extreme danger that mercury poses to the environment.

==Prevention and remedy==
[[File:Syncorals.jpg|thumb|260px|right|{{center|Synthetic corals}}]]

Cleaning up the existing mercury pollution could be a tedious process. Nevertheless, there is some promising ongoing research bringing hope to the challenging task. One such research is based nanotechnology. It uses synthesized aluminum oxide nanoparticles (Al2O3) mimicking the coral structures. These structures absorb heavy metal toxins effectively due to high surface/volume ratio and the quality of surface. In nature, it has been long observed corals can absorb heavy metal ions due to its surface structure and this new technique has used to nanotechnology to create “synthetic corals” which may help clean mercury in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;X. Wang et al. / J. Colloid Interface Sci., 2015, 453, pp 244-251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://webnesday.com/this-fake-coral-sucks-up-mercury-pollution-for-a-cleaner-ocean/ (September, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The reactions involved in synthesizing this material are;

Another novel material (Patent application: PCT/US15/55205) is still under investigation which looks at the possibility of cleaning mercury pollution using orange peels as raw material. This technology produces sulfur limonene polysulphide (proposed material) using sulfur and limonene. Using industrial byproducts to manufacture this polymer makes it a highly sustainable approach.The scientists say 50% of the mercury content could be reduced with a single treatment using this polymer.&lt;ref&gt;https://theconversation.com/we-created-a-new-material-from-orange-peel-that-can-clean-up-mercury-pollution-49355 (10/25/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the cleaning processes, minimizing usage of coal power and shifting to cleaner energy sources, reducing small scale artisanal gold mining, proper treatment of industrial mercury waste, and implementation of policies are sound approaches to reduce mercury emissions in the long term-large scale plan. Public awareness is critical in achieving this goal. Proper disposal of mercury containing items such as medicinal packaging and thermometers, using mercury-free bulbs and batteries, buying consumer products with zero or minimum mercury emission to the environment can make a significant difference in recovering world’s ecosystems from mercury pollution leaving minimum legacy of mercury pollution in the ocean for our future generations.

'''Miraah''' is a solar plant that is under construction for the production of steam in [[Oman]].&lt;ref name=forbes /&gt;
In July 2015, [[Petroleum Development Oman]] and [[GlassPoint Solar]] announced that they signed a $600 million agreement to build the 1 GWth solar field. The project will be the world's largest solar field measured by peak thermal capacity.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news|title= Ironic Or Economic?

== Overview ==
Miraah will be one of the world’s largest solar plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awesomeengineering.net/worlds-largest-solar-plants-produce-oil/]&lt;/ref&gt; The solar thermal facility will harness the sun’s energy to produce steam used in oil production. Once complete, it will deliver the largest peak energy output of any solar plant in the world.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The 1 GWth project will reduce the amount of natural gas used to generate steam for [[Steam injection (oil industry)|thermal]] [[enhanced oil recovery]] (EOR). In thermal EOR, steam is injected into an oil reservoir to heat the oil, making it easier to pump to the surface. Miraah will generate an average of 6,000 tons of solar steam each day, providing a substantial portion of the steam required at the Amal oilfield operated by Petroleum Development Oman (PDO).

The mega project dwarfs all previous solar EOR installations and is more than 100 times larger than the pilot project built by GlassPoint for PDO in 2012. The pilot was completed safely, on time and on budget, and has been operating successfully for more than two years. The pilot exceeded PDO’s expectations for steam delivery and system reliability, paving the way for this significant expansion.
[[File:Miraah Mirrors.jpg|alt=A look at the curved mirrors used at the Miraah facility|thumb|300x300px|A look at the curved mirrors used at the Miraah facility]]
The enclosed trough solar field uses curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto a pipe filled with water. The concentrated sunlight boils the water to create steam, which is fed directly to the oilfield’s existing steam distribution network. The steam generated is exactly the same quality, temperature and pressure as steam produced by burning natural gas.

A glasshouse protects the solar array from harsh oilfield conditions like wind and dust storms. As a result, GlassPoint can use lightweight and inexpensive components inside the glasshouse. Automated washing reduces costs further and preserves scarce water resources.

The technology is proven and easy to scale by building projects in standard glasshouse modules. GlassPoint’s production-line approach constructs several glasshouses in parallel and commissions them in modules of four for rapid deployment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glasspoint.com/miraah/&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, GlassPoint and its contractors crossed the threshold of 1.5 million man-hours worked without lost time injury (LTI) at Miraah.

In November 2017, GlassPoint and Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) completed construction on the first block of the Miraah solar plant safely on schedule and on budget, and successfully delivered steam to the Amal West oilfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171101005644/en/Petroleum-Development-Oman-GlassPoint-Announce-Commencement-Steam|title=Petroleum Development Oman and GlassPoint Announce Commencement of Steam Delivery From Miraah Solar Plant|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kultstatue Zeus Ypsistos.jpg|thumb|300 px|Details of a statue of Zeus Hypsistos, Archaeological museum, Dion]]
Archaeological and historical finds, as well as contemporary works of art are displayed in the '''museums and exhibitions at Mount Olympus'''.

== [[Archaeological Museum of Dion|Archaeological Museum Dion]] ==
Here are the finds of the archaeological site of Dion and the surrounding area exhibited. The museum is divided into three floors. In the basement there are coins, pottery and antique building materials. On the ground floor is a small cinema, the exhibition shows mainly finds of the sanctuaries of Dion. Upstairs is the famous water organ, the [[Hydraulis of Dion|Hydraulis]]. There are also changing exhibitions of archaeological finds from the wider area.&lt;ref&gt;Hellenic Republic, Ministry of culture and sports, Onassis Foundation USA: ''Gods and Mortals at Olympus.'' Edited by Dimitrios Pandermalis, {{ISBN|978-0-9906142-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate building, the Archaeotheke, the approximately 100 m² [[Dionysus mosaic, Dion|mosaic of the Epiphany of Dionysus]] is displayed.

== Archaeological Museum Makrygialos ==
[[File:Agia Triada, Sparmos Ikone aus dem 17. Jhdt.jpg|thumb|Icon from the 17. century, Agia Triada, Sparmos]]
[[File:Miniatur Holzschnitzerei, Agios Dionysios, Litochoro.jpg|thumb|Miniature woodcarving within a metal cross. Agios Dionysios, Litochoro]]
The ground floor of the building houses the offices of archaeologists, the laboratory and workshops, the museum is upstairs. Currently, only a few of the many finds from [[Ancient Pydna|Pydna]], the necropolis of Pydna, [[Ancient Methone|Methone]], [[Makrygialos]] and its surroundings can be seen in the museum. Some smaller, mostly clay exhibits and amphorae, some of which are used as urns or sarcophagi for toddlers, are exhibited. The museum is not open to the public yet.

== [[Alexandrion (Litochoro)|Alexandrion, Litochoro]] ==
The building, built by Greek Macedonians living abroad, deals with the life and work of [[Alexander the Great]]. In addition to the permanent exhibition, the building also serves representative purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panmacedonian.info|title=Pan-Macedonian Association, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Museum of the [[Agia Triada Monastery]], Sparmos ==
Exhibits of the museum include icons from the 17th century, precious vestments, old wood carvings and books, written and bound by the monks of the monastery. During the liberation struggle against the [[Ottomans]], the monks stored food and ammunition for the militants and cared for the wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Ιερά Μονή Αγίας Τριάδας Σπαρμού Ολυμπου, Self-published by the monastery, 2006, {{ISBN|960-89151-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Museum of the [[Monastery Agios Dionysios]], Litochoro ==
Historical documents, from the document approving the construction of the monastery, to photographs of a soldier of the [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]], which show the old monastery shortly before its destruction, prove the past of the monastery. Released in silver are relics, vestments, an epitaph woven with silver threads, documents, books, icons and inlaid pieces of furniture. Above the museum is the library of the monastery, which is not accessible to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Holy Patriarchal and Stavropegic Monastery of St. Dionysios of Olympus: I Iera Patriarchiki ke Stavropigiaki Moni tou Agiou Dionysiou tou en Olymbou. Publisher: Holy Patriarchal and Stavropegic Monastery of St. Dionysios of Olympus, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Geological Museum of Mount Olympus]] ==
Information boards and models explain the origin and geological structure of the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]]. Displayed are [[fossils]], any type of stones occurring in the mountains and photographs of geologically significant objects. Special exhibits are fossils of marine animals that were found in the Olympus at an altitude of about 1000 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= |title= Video about the museum|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuUAohUKKL4|access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Olympus National Park Information Center]], Litochoro ==
The exhibition takes the visitor through all regions of the mountains. Starting from the village [[Litochoro]], the animals and plants of different altitudes are explained by means of display boards in Greek and English language. Interactive screens allow 360° visibility from different locations; a small cinema shows a 3-D movie about the Olympus massif. Furthermore, there is information about archaeological sites, monasteries, mythology, geology and the history of the first ascent of the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympusfd.gr/us/|title=Olympus National Park management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Nautical Museum of Litochoro]] ==
[[File:Fossilien, Geologisches Museum des Olymp.jpg|thumb|Fossils, Geological Museum of Mount Olympus]]
The Nautical Museum was founded to preserve the tradition of the merchant shipping industry. The exhibits are mainly from private ownership, partly from shipowners or the navy. Certificates, logbooks and old photographs are exhibited alongside nautical instruments and nautical objects. A special feature is the replica of the bridge of a merchant ship with all instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nmlitohorou.gr/index.php/en|title=Homepage of the museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Center for Literature and Arts, Dion|Mosaic center, Dion]] ==
During the summer months, exhibitions with changing themes take place here as part of the [[Olympus Festival]]. Frequently, the respective host country of the Olympus Festival uses the opportunity to present its art and culture here. Occasionally artists from Greece organize exhibitions of their works. You can see mosaics, paintings, photographs, sculptures, prints etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalolympou.gr/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/festival_olympou46_2017.pdf|title=Program of the Olympus Festival 2017, including the announcment of an exhibition (Art exhibition of antiques and water, 1. of July 2017) at the Mosaic center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Folklore Museum of Katerini]] ==
The museum is intended to preserve the culture of the Pontic Greeks, who come from the Black Sea region. On display are furniture, tools, costumes and embroidery. The replica of a typical residential building shows how people lived before their expulsion.

== Museum of the [[Syllogos Mikrasiaton Pierias]] ==
The exhibition follows the theme Asia Minor. The club shows in his museum pictures, photographs, traditional costumes, uniforms, traditional clothing and items for the daily use, mostly gifted from the refugees of Asia Minor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10433">'''Nucleate boiling''' is a type of [[boiling]] that takes place when the surface temperature is hotter than the saturated fluid temperature by a certain amount but where the [[heat flux]] is below the [[critical heat flux]]. For water, as shown in the graph below, nucleate boiling occurs when the surface temperature is higher than the [[Boiling_point#Saturation_temperature_and_pressure|saturation temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) by between {{convert|10|C-change}} to {{convert|30|C-change}}. The critical heat flux is the peak on the curve between nucleate boiling and transition boiling. The heat transfer from surface to liquid is greater than that in film boiling.

==Mechanism==

[[File:Heat transfer leading to Leidenfrost effect for water at 1 atm.png|thumb|450px|border|right|Behavior of water on a hot plate. Graph shows heat transfer (flux) v. temperature (in degrees Celsius) above T&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[saturation temperature]] of water, {{convert|100|C}}.]] 

Two different regimes may be distinguished in the nucleate boiling range. When the temperature difference is between approximately {{convert|4|C-change}} to {{convert|10|C-change}} above T&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, isolated bubbles form at [[nucleation]] sites and separate from the surface. This separation induces considerable fluid mixing near the surface, substantially increasing the convective [[heat transfer coefficient]] and the heat flux. In this regime, most of the heat transfer is through direct transfer from the surface to the liquid in motion at the surface and not through the [[vapor]] bubbles rising from the surface.

Between {{convert|10|C-change}} and {{convert|30|C-change}} above T&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, a second flow regime may be observed. As more nucleation sites become active, increased bubble formation causes [[Liquid bubble|bubble]] interference and coalescence. In this region the vapor escapes as jets or columns which subsequently merge into slugs of vapor.

Interference between the densely populated bubbles inhibits the motion of liquid near the surface. This is observed on the graph as a change in the direction of the gradient of the curve or an inflection in the boiling curve. After this point, the heat transfer coefficient starts to reduce as the surface temperature is further increased although the product of the heat transfer coefficient and the temperature difference (the heat flux) is still increasing.

When the relative increase in the temperature difference is balanced by the relative reduction in the heat transfer coefficient, a maximum heat flux is achieved as observed by the peak in the graph. This is the critical heat flux. At this point in the maximum, considerable vapor is being formed, making it difficult for the liquid to continuously wet the surface to receive heat from the surface. This causes the heat flux to reduce after this point. At extremes, film boiling commonly known as the [[Leidenfrost effect]] is observed.

[[File:Boiling Curve.jpg|thumb|450px|border|right|Boiling curve for water at 1atm]]
The process of forming [[steam]] [[Liquid bubble|bubbles]] within [[liquid]] in micro cavities adjacent to the wall if the wall temperature at the [[heat transfer]] surface rises above the [[saturation temperature]] while the bulk of the liquid ([[heat exchanger]]) is [[subcooled]]. The bubbles grow until they reach some critical size, at which point they separate from the wall and are carried into the main [[fluid]] stream. There the bubbles collapse because the temperature of bulk fluid is not as high as at the heat transfer surface, where the bubbles were created. This collapsing is also responsible for the sound a water kettle produces during heat up but before the temperature at which bulk boiling is reached.

[[Heat transfer]] and [[mass transfer]] during nucleate boiling has a significant effect on the heat transfer rate. This heat transfer process helps quickly and efficiently to carry away the [[energy]] created at the heat transfer surface and is therefore sometimes desirable—for example in [[nuclear power plant]]s, where liquid is used as a [[coolant]].

The effects of nucleate boiling take place at two locations:
* the liquid-wall interface
* the bubble-liquid interface

The nucleate boiling process has a complex nature. A limited number of experimental studies provided valuable insights into the boiling phenomena, however these studies provided often contradictory data due to internal recalculation (state of [[Chaos theory|chaos]] in the fluid not applying to classical [[thermodynamic]] methods of calculation, therefore giving wrong return values) and have not provided conclusive findings yet to develop models and correlations. Nucleate boiling phenomenon still requires more understanding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050195867_2005195125.pdf "Nucleate Boiling Heat Transfer Studied Under Reduced-Gravity Conditions"], Dr. David F. Chao and Dr. Mohammad M. Hasan, Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications, [[NASA]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boiling heat transfer correlations==
The nucleate boiling regime is important to engineers because of the high heat fluxes possible with moderate temperature differences. The data can be correlated by equation of the form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Incropera, Frank. Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer 6th Edition. John Wiley and Sons, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;N{{u}_{b}}={{C}_{fc}}\left( R{{e}_{b}},P{{r}_{L}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The Nusselt number is defined as,

&lt;math&gt;N{{u}_{b}}=\frac{\left( \frac{q}{A} \right){{D}_{b}}}{\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right){{k}_{L}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where q/A is the total heat flux, &lt;math&gt;D_b&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum bubble diameter as it leaves the surface, &lt;math&gt;{{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; is the excess temperature, &lt;math&gt;k_L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal conductivity]] of the liquid and &lt;math&gt;Pr_L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Prandtl number]] of the liquid. The bubble [[Reynolds number]], &lt;math&gt;Re_b&lt;/math&gt; is defined as,

&lt;math&gt;R{{e}_{b}}=\frac{{{D}_{b}}{{G}_{b}}}{{{\mu }_{L}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;G_b&lt;/math&gt; is the average mass velocity of the vapor leaving the surface and &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{L}}&lt;/math&gt; is the liquid [[viscosity]].

Rohsenow has developed the first and most widely used correlation for nucleate boiling,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;James R. Welty; Charles E. Wicks; Robert E. Wilson; Gregory L. Rorrer., "Fundamentals of Momentum, Heat and Mass transfer" 5th edition, John Wiley and Sons&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{q}{A}={{\mu }_{L}}{{h}_{fg}}{{\left[ \frac{g\left( {{\rho }_{L}}-{{\rho }_{v}} \right)}{\sigma } \right]}^{{}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{2}\;}}{{\left[ \frac{{{c}_{pL}}\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right)}{{{C}_{sf}}{{h}_{fg}}Pr_{L}^{n}} \right]}^{3}\;}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;c_{pL}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat of the liquid. &lt;math&gt;C_{sf}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface fluid combination and vary for various combinations of fluid and surface. The variable n depends on the surface fluid combination and typically has a value of 1.0 or 1.7. For example, water and nickel have a &lt;math&gt;C_{sf}&lt;/math&gt; of 0.006 and n of 1.0.

==Departure from nucleate boiling==
If the [[heat flux]] of a boiling system is higher than the [[critical heat flux]] (CHF) of the system, the bulk fluid may boil, or in some cases, ''regions'' of the bulk fluid may boil where the fluid travels in small channels. Thus large bubbles form, sometimes blocking the passage of the fluid. This results in a '''departure from nucleate boiling''' ('''DNB''') in which steam bubbles no longer break away from the solid surface of the channel, bubbles dominate the channel or surface, and the heat flux dramatically decreases. Vapor essentially insulates the bulk liquid from the hot surface.

During DNB, the surface temperature must therefore increase substantially above the bulk fluid temperature in order to maintain a high heat flux. Avoiding the CHF is an [[process engineering|engineering problem]] in heat transfer applications, such as [[nuclear reactor]]s, where fuel plates must not be allowed to overheat. DNB may be avoided in practice by increasing the [[pressure]] of the fluid, increasing its [[Flow measurement|flow rate]], or by utilizing a lower temperature bulk fluid which has a higher CHF. If the bulk fluid temperature is too low or the pressure of the fluid is too high, nucleate boiling is however not possible.

DNB is also known as '''Transition boiling''', '''unstable film boiling''', and '''partial film boiling'''. For water boiling as shown on the graph, transition boiling occurs when the temperature difference between the surface and the boiling water is approximately {{convert|30|C-change}} to {{convert|120|C-change}} above the T&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;. This corresponds to the high peak and the low peak on the boiling curve. The low point between transition boiling and film boiling is the [[Leidenfrost effect|Leidenfrost point]].

During transition boiling of water, the bubble formation is so rapid that a vapor film or blanket begins to form at the surface. However, at any point on the surface, the conditions may oscillate between film and nucleate boiling, but the fraction of the total surface covered by the film increases with increasing temperature difference. As the [[thermal conductivity]] of the vapor is much less than that of the liquid, the convective [[heat transfer coefficient]] and the heat flux reduces with increasing temperature difference.

'''Koninklijke Philips N.V.''' (literally ''Royal Philips'', stylized as '''PHILIPS''') is a Dutch multinational technology company headquartered in [[Amsterdam]] currently focused in the area of healthcare and lighting. It was founded in [[Eindhoven]] in 1891 by [[Gerard Philips]] and his father Frederik, with their first products being [[light bulb]]s. It was once one of the largest electronic conglomerates in the world and currently employs around 74,000 people across 100 countries.&lt;ref name="annrep"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3APHG&amp;fstype=ii&amp;ei=aX5ZVergDMPGugSJo4DoBg |title=Annual Report 2014|accessdate=19 August 2012|publisher=Philips}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company gained its [[Koninklijk|royal honorary title]] in 1998 and dropped the "Electronics" in its name in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.industryweek.com/global-economy/philips-drops-electronics-name-strategy-switch&lt;/ref&gt;

Philips is organized into two main divisions: Philips Consumer health and well-being (formerly Philips Consumer Electronics and Philips Domestic Appliances and Personal Care) and Philips Professional Healthcare (formerly Philips Medical Systems). The lighting division was spun off as a separate company, Signify N.V. (formerly Philips Lighting prior to 2018). The company started making electric shavers in 1939 under the [[Philishave]] brand, and post-war they developed the [[Compact Cassette]] format and co-developed the [[Compact Disc]] format with [[Sony]], as well as numerous other technologies. As of 2012, Philips was the largest manufacturer of lighting in the world as measured by applicable revenues. 

Philips has a primary listing on the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|Euronext Amsterdam]] stock exchange and is a component of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/equities/indices/euro+stoxx+50+EU0009658145/constituents|title=Börse Frankfurt (Frankfurt Stock Exchange): Stock market quotes, charts and news|website=Boerse-frankfurt.de|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a secondary listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].

==History==
[[File:Gerard philips.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gerard Philips]] ]]
[[File:Philipsfabriekje.jpg|thumb|right|The very first Philips factory in Eindhoven, now a public museum]]
The Philips Company was founded in 1891, by [[Gerard Philips]] and his father Frederik Philips. Frederik, a banker based in [[Zaltbommel]], financed the purchase and setup of an empty factory building in Eindhoven, where the company started the production of carbon-filament lamps and other electro-technical products in 1892. This first factory has been adapted and is used as a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philips-museum.com/uk/|title=Philips Museum|website=Philips-museum.com|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy, the Philipses brought in [[Anton Philips|Anton]], Gerard's younger brother by sixteen years.  Though he had earned a degree in engineering, Anton started work as a sales representative; soon, however, he began to contribute many important business ideas. With Anton's arrival, the family business began to expand rapidly, resulting in the founding of Philips Metaalgloeilampfabriek N.V. (Philips Metal Filament Lamp Factory Ltd.) in Eindhoven in 1908, followed in 1912, by the foundation of Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken N.V. (Philips Lightbulb Factories Ltd.). After Gerard and Anton Philips changed their family business by founding the Philips [[corporation]], they laid the foundations for the later electronics [[multinational corporation|multinational]].

In the 1920s, the company started to manufacture other products, such as [[vacuum tubes]]. In 1939, they introduced their electric [[razor]], the ''[[Philishave]]'' (marketed in the US using the [[Norelco]] brand name). The "Chapel" is a radio with built-in loudspeaker, which was designed during the early 1930s.

[[File:Philips 930.jpg|thumb|upright|Philips 'Chapel' radio model 930A, 1931|alt=Curved, triangular radio with brown wooden cabinet]]
On 11 March 1927, Philips went on the air with shortwave radio station [[PCJJ]] (later PCJ) which was joined in 1929 by sister station PHOHI (Philips Omroep Holland-Indië). PHOHI broadcast in Dutch to the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) while PCJJ broadcast in English, Spanish and German to the rest of the world.

The international program on Sundays commenced in 1928, with host Eddie Startz hosting the ''[[Happy Station]]'' show, which became the world's longest-running shortwave program. Broadcasts from the Netherlands were interrupted by the German invasion in May 1940. The Germans commandeered the transmitters in [[Huizen]] to use for pro-[[Nazi broadcasts]], some originating from Germany, others concerts from Dutch broadcasters under German control.

Philips Radio was absorbed shortly after [[Emancipation|liberation]] when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in 1947 and renamed [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]], the Dutch International Service. Some PCJ programs, such as ''[[Happy Station]]'', continued on the new station.

===Stirling engine===
Philips was instrumental in the revival of the [[Stirling engine]] when, in the early 1930s, the management decided that offering a low-power portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain. Engineers at the company's research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten Stirling engine would be most suitable, citing its quiet operation (both audibly and in terms of radio interference) and ability to run on a variety of heat sources (common lamp oil&amp;nbsp;– "cheap and available everywhere"&amp;nbsp;– was favored).&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hargreaves (1991). ''The Philips Stirling Engine''. [[Elsevier Science]]. {{ISBN|0-444-88463-7}}. pp.28–30&lt;/ref&gt; They were also aware that, unlike steam and internal combustion engines, virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the Stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and know-how should enable great improvements.&lt;ref&gt;''Philips Technical Review'' Vol.9 No.4 page 97 (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by their first experimental engine, which produced 16&amp;nbsp;W of shaft power from a bore and stroke of {{nowrap|30 mm × 25 mm}},&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hargreaves (1991), Fig. 3&lt;/ref&gt; various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout [[World War II]]. By the late 1940s, the 'Type 10' was ready to be handed over to Philips's subsidiary Johan de Witt in Dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned. The result, rated at 180/200&amp;nbsp;W electrical output from a bore and stroke of {{nowrap|55 mm × 27 mm}}, was designated MP1002CA (known as the "Bungalow set"). Production of an initial batch of 250 began in 1951, but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price, besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing. Approximately 150 of these sets were eventually produced.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hargreaves (1991), p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with the generator set Philips developed experimental Stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late 1970s, though the only commercial success was the 'reversed Stirling engine' [[Applications of the Stirling engine#Stirling cryocoolers|cryocooler]]. However, they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information, which they later licensed to other companies.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hargreaves (1991), p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shavers===
The first Philips shaver was introduced in the 1930s, and was simply called [[Philishave]]. In the US, it was called [[Norelco]]. The Philishave has remained part of the Philips product line-up until the present.

===World War II===
On 9 May 1940, the Philips directors learned that the German [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion]] of the [[Netherlands]] was to take place the following day. Having prepared for this, [[Anton Philips]] and his son in law [[Frans Otten]], as well as other Philips family members, fled to the United States, taking a large amount of the company capital with them. Operating from the US as the '''North American Philips Company,''' they managed to run the company throughout the war. At the same time, the company was moved (on paper) to the [[Netherlands Antilles]] to keep it out of German hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philips Electronics NV {{!}} Dutch manufacturer|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Philips-Electronics-NV|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 1942, the British [[No. 2 Group RAF]] undertook [[Operation Oyster (1942)|Operation Oyster]], which heavily damaged the Philips Radio factory in Eindhoven with few casualties among the Dutch workers and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/61/a3537461.shtml|title=BBC - WW2 People's War - Operation Oyster, Part 1|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philips works in Eindhoven was bombed again by the RAF on 30 March 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eDoRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=philips%20+%20eindhoven%20+%20bombed%20+%20march%20+%201943&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lwJXrwkLt0&amp;sig=5Wox2HGZBpbCSuObMHDnL4uymBs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMmcec4c7NAhXIKyYKHVKIBpQQ6AEINDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=philips%20+%20eindhoven%20+%20bombed%20+%20march%20+%201943&amp;f=false|title=The Bomber Command War Diaries: An Operational Reference Book|first1=Chris|last1=Everitt|first2=Martin|last2=Middlebrook|date=2 April 2014|publisher=Pen and Sword|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wehrmacht-history.com/timeline/1943/30th-march-1943-wwii-timeline.htm|title=30th March 1943 WWII Timeline|first=Mr A I|last=Bruce|website=Wehrmacht-history.com|accessdate=30 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212105810/http://www.wehrmacht-history.com/timeline/1943/30th-march-1943-wwii-timeline.htm|archive-date=12 February 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frits Philips]], the son of Anton, was the only Philips family member to stay in the Netherlands. He saved the lives of 382 Jews by convincing the Nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at Philips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frits Philips celebrates 100th birthday|date=15 April 2005|accessdate=10 January 2015|publisher=Philips|url=http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/news/archive/news2005/article-14959.wpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 he was held at the internment camp for political prisoners [[List of subcamps of KZ Herzogenbusch|at Vught]] for several months because a strike at his factory reduced production. For his actions in saving the hundreds of Jews, he was recognized by [[Yad Vashem]] in 1995 as a "[[Righteous Among the Nations]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of the [[Righteous Among the Nations]]: Rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust: The Netherlands'', Jerusalem: [[Yad Vashem]], 2004, pp. 596–597&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1945–1999 ===
After the war the company was moved back to the Netherlands, with their headquarters in [[Eindhoven]].

[[File:Eindhoven Evoluon 03.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Evoluon]] in Eindhoven, opened in 1966]]
In 1949, the company began selling [[television set]]s.&lt;ref name=waarom&gt;{{cite news|title=Waarom stopt Philips met zelf televisies maken?|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2680/Economie/article/detail/1876925/2011/04/18/Waarom-stopt-Philips-met-zelf-televisies-maken.dhtml|accessdate=18 April 2011|newspaper=[[de Volkskrant]]|date=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, it formed [[Philips Records]], which eventually formed part of  [[PolyGram]].

Philips introduced the audio [[Compact Cassette|Compact Audio Cassette]] tape in 1963, and it was wildly successful. Compact cassettes were initially used for [[dictation machines]] for office typing [[shorthand|steno]]graphers and professional journalists. As their sound quality improved, cassettes would also be used to record sound and became the second mass media alongside [[vinyl records]] used to sell recorded music.

[[File:PHILIPS D6350.jpg|thumb|right|An early portable Compact Cassette recorder by Philips (model D6350)]]
Philips introduced the first combination [[portable radio]] and cassette recorder, which was marketed as the "radiorecorder", and is now better known as the [[boom box]]. Later, the cassette was used in telephone [[answering machine]]s, including a special form of cassette where the tape was wound on an endless loop. The C-cassette was used as the first [[mass storage device]] for early personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s. Philips reduced the cassette size for the professional needs with the [[Mini-Cassette]], although it would not be as successful as the [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] [[Microcassette]].  This became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully [[digital dictation]] machines.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Philips continued with computers through the early 1990s (see separate article: [[Philips Computers]]).

In 1972, Philips launched the world's first home [[video cassette recorder]], in the UK, the N1500. Its relatively bulky video cassettes could record 30 minutes or 45 minutes. Later one-hour tapes were also offered. As competition came from [[Sony]]'s [[Betamax]] and the [[VHS]] group of manufacturers, Philips introduced the N1700 system which allowed double-length recording. For the first time, a 2-hour movie could fit onto one video cassette.  In 1977, the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the UK, featuring comedian [[Denis Norden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/105150|title=BFI – Film &amp; TV Database – The Philips Time Machine (1977)|work=The [[British Film Institute]] Web Database|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was quickly copied by the Japanese makers, whose tapes were significantly cheaper. Philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the [[Video 2000]] system, with tapes that could be used on both sides and had 8 hours of total recording time. As Philips only sold its systems on the PAL standard and in Europe, and the Japanese makers sold globally, the scale advantages of the Japanese proved insurmountable and Philips withdrew the V2000 system and joined the VHS Coalition.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Philips CD-100.JPG|thumb|right|Philips CD-100, the second ever commercially released CD player (after partner Sony's [[Sony CDP-101|CDP-101]])]]
Philips had developed a [[LaserDisc]] early on for selling movies, but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales. Later Philips joined with [[MCA Inc.|MCA]] to launch the first commercial LaserDisc standard and players. In 1982, Philips teamed with Sony to launch the [[Compact Disc]]; this format evolved into the [[CD-R]], [[CD-RW]], [[DVD]] and later [[Blu-ray]], which Philips launched with Sony in 1997{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and 2006 respectively.

In 1984, the Dutch Philips Group bought out nearly a one-third share and took over the management of German company [[Grundig]].

In 1984, Philips split off its activities on the field of [[Photolithography|photolithographic]] integrated circuit production equipment, the so-called wafer steppers, into a joint venture with [[ASM International]], located in [[Veldhoven]] under the name [[ASML Holding|ASML]]. Over the years, this new company has evolved into the world's leading manufacturer of chip production machines at the expense of competitors like [[Nikon]] and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]].

In 1991, the company's name was changed from N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken to Philips Electronics N.V. At the same time, North American Philips was formally dissolved, and a new corporate division was formed in the US with the name Philips Electronics North America Corp.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1991-1992, Philips along with their subsidiary Magnavox, released the [[Philips CD-i]], a combined [[CD player]] and [[home video game console]]. It sold one million units and was discontinued in 1998 after being heavily criticized amongst the gaming community.&lt;ref name="gamepro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/111823.shtml |title=The 10 Worst-Selling Consoles of All Time |accessdate=November 1, 2016 |first1=Blake|last1=Snow |publisher=[[GamePro]].com |date=May 5, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508035815/http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/111823.shtml |archivedate=May 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the company officers decided to move the headquarters from Eindhoven to [[Amsterdam]] along with the corporate name change to [[Koninklijk]]e Philips Electronics N.V., the latter of which was finalized on 16 March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.trouw.nl/home/philips-gaat-aan-naam-eindelijk-het-woord-koninklijke-toevoegen~a0329b2a/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
The move of the headquarters to Amsterdam was completed in 2001. Initially, the company was housed in the [[Rembrandt Tower]]. In 2002 it moved again, this time to the Breitner Tower. Philips Lighting, [[Philips Research]], [[Philips Semiconductors]] (spun off as NXP in September 2006) and Philips Design, are still based in Eindhoven. Philips Healthcare is headquartered in both [[Best, Netherlands]] (near Eindhoven) and [[Andover, Massachusetts]], United States (near Boston).

In 2000, Philips bought Optiva Corporation, the maker of [[Sonicare]] [[electric toothbrush]]es. The company was renamed Philips Oral Healthcare and made a subsidiary of Philips DAP. In 2001, Philips acquired [[Agilent Technologies|Agilent Technologies']] Healthcare Solutions Group (HSG) for EUR 2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Philips+Completes+Acquisition+Agilent+Technologies'+Healthcare...-a076902583|title=Philips Completes Acquisition Agilent Technologies' Healthcare Solutions Group|publisher=Thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philips created a computer monitors joint venture with [[LG]] called [[LG.Philips Displays]] in 2001.

[[File:Philips sense and simplicity.svg|thumb|right|Philips's new 2004 slogan]]
In 2004, Philips abandoned the slogan "Let's make things better" in favour of a new one: "Sense and simplicity".

In December 2005 Philips announced its intention to sell or demerge its semiconductor division. On 1 September 2006, it was announced in Berlin that the name of the new company formed by the division would be [[NXP Semiconductors]]. On 2 August 2006, Philips completed an agreement to sell a controlling 80.1% stake in NXP Semiconductors to a consortium of [[private equity]] investors consisting of [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.]] (KKR), [[Silver Lake Partners]] and [[AlpInvest Partners]]. On 21 August 2006, [[Bain Capital]] and [[Apax Partners]] announced that they had signed definitive commitments to join the acquiring consortium, a process which was completed on 1 October 2006.

In 2006 Philips bought out the company [[Lifeline Systems, Inc.|Lifeline Systems]] headquartered in [[Framingham]], [[Massachusetts]] in a deal valued at $750 million, its biggest move yet to expand its consumer-health business (M).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113765652747250681 |title= Philips electronics to buy lifeline to expand in consumer health|website=Wsj.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, Philips acquired the company Ximis, Inc. headquartered in [[El Paso, Texas]] for their Medical Informatics Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2007-08/8833411-philips-to-acquire-healthcare-informatics-company-ximis-inc-to-strengthen-presence-in-the-healthcare-information-technology-market-004.htm|title=Philips to Acquire Healthcare Informatics Company XIMIS Inc. to Strengthen Presence in the Healthcare Information Technology Market|website=Finanznachrichten.de|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, it purchased a Moore Microprocessor Patent (MPP) Portfolio license from The TPL Group.

On 21 December 2007, Philips and [[Respironics, Inc.]] announced a definitive agreement pursuant to which Philips acquired all of the outstanding shares of Respironics for US$66 per share, or a total purchase price of approximately €3.6&amp;nbsp;billion (US$5.1&amp;nbsp;billion) in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscenter.philips.com/about/news/press/20071221_pressrelease_respironics.page_20071221_pressrelease_respironics|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516125532/http://www.newscenter.philips.com/about/news/press/20071221_pressrelease_respironics.page_20071221_pressrelease_respironics|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 May 2016|title=News center - Philips|website=Arquivo.pt|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2008, Philips completed the acquisition of VISICU Baltimore, Maryland through the merger of its indirect wholly owned subsidiary into VISICU. As a result of that merger, VISICU has become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Philips. VISICU was the creator of the eICU concept of the use of Telemedicine from a centralized facility to monitor and care for ICU patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/20080221_completion_visicu.wpd |title=Philips completes acquisition of US-based VISICU |publisher=Newscenter.philips.com |date=21 February 2008 |accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium|Philips physics laboratory]] was scaled down in the early 21st century, as the company ceased trying to be innovative in consumer electronics through [[fundamental research]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NRC Handelsblad]], 4 September 2010 ''Het nieuwe Philips wordt blij van een iPad-hoesje/The new Philips becomes happy from an iPad cover'', Dutch original:" 'We zijn geen high-tech bedrijf meer, het gaat erom dat de technologieën introduceren die breed gedragen worden door de consument', zegt Valk [..] Consumer Lifestyle is nu zodanig ingericht dat er geen jaren meer gewerkt wordt aan uitvindingen die weinig kans van slagen hebben.

North American Philips distributed [[AKG Acoustics]] products under the AKG of America, Philips Audio/Video, Norelco and AKG Acoustics Inc. branding until AKG set up its North American division in [[San Leandro, California]] in 1985.  (AKG's North American division has since moved to [[Northridge, California]].)

Polymer Vision was a Philips spin-off that manufactured a flexible [[e-ink]] display screen. The company closed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;John Biggs, Tech Crunch.

==Sponsorships==
[[File:PSV Stadion Eindhoven.JPG|thumb|right|PSV's Philips Stadion]]
In 1913, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands, Philips founded ''Philips Sports Vereniging'' (Philips Sports Club, now commonly known as PSV). The club is active in numerous sports but is now best known for its football team, [[PSV Eindhoven]], and swimming team. Philips owns the naming rights to [[Philips Stadion]] in [[Eindhoven]], which is the home ground of PSV Eindhoven.

Outside of the Netherlands, Philips sponsors and has sponsored numerous sports clubs, sports facilities and events. In November 2008 Philips renewed and extended its [[F1]] partnership with [[AT&amp;T Williams]]. Philips owns the [[naming rights]] to the ''Philips Championship'', the premier basketball league in Australia, traditionally known as the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]]. From 1988 to 1993 Philips was the principal sponsor of the [[Australian rugby league]] team [[The Balmain Tigers]] and Indonesian football club side [[Persiba Balikpapan]]. From 1998 to 2000, Philips sponsored the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Winston Cup]] #7 entry for [[Geoff Bodine Racing]], later [[Ultra Motorsports]], for drivers [[Geoff Bodine]] and [[Michael Waltrip]]. From 1999 to 2018, Philips held the naming rights to [[Philips Arena]] in [[Atlanta]], home of the [[Atlanta Hawks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] and former home of the defunct [[Atlanta Thrashers]] of the [[National Hockey League]].

Outside of sports, Philips sponsors the international ''Philips [[Monsters of Rock]] festival''.

==Environmental record==
===Green initiatives===
Philips is running the EcoVision4 initiative in which it committed to a number of environmentally positive improvements by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hruthvik Cosner|url=https://hruthvikcosner.blogspot.com/2018/11/philips-hue.html|title=Philips Hue - The best deals and all the information|publisher=Philips|accessdate=7 January 2011}}|date=November 2018 |website: hruthvikCosner.blogspot.com| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also Philips marks its "green" products with the Philips Green Logo, identifying them as products that have a significantly better environmental performance than their competitors or predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philips.com/about/sustainability/ourgreenproducts/index.page |title=Philips – Our Green Products| publisher=Philips |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===L-Prize competition===
In 2011, Philips won a $10 million cash prize from the [[US Department of Energy]] for winning its [[L Prize|L-Prize]] competition, to produce a high-efficiency, long operating life replacement for a standard 60-W [[incandescent lightbulb]].&lt;ref name="L-prize"&gt;Margery Conner, EE Times. "[http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4218485/-10M-L-Prize-goes-to-Philips-for-60W-replacement-LED-bulb $10M L Prize goes to Philips for 60W replacement LED bulb]." 3 August 2011. Retrieved 5 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The winning [[LED lightbulb]], which was made available to consumers in April 2012, produces slightly more than 900 [[lumens]] at an input power of only 10 W.&lt;ref name="philwin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lightingprize.org/philips-winner.stm |title= DOE Announces Philips as First Winner of the L Prize Competition |publisher=[[US Department of Energy]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60jS9wT6Q?url=http://www.lightingprize.org/philips-winner.stm |archivedate=6 August 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenpeace ranking===
In [[Greenpeace]]'s 2012 Guide to Greener Electronics, that ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, [[climate and energy]] and how green their products are, Philips ranks 10th place with a score of 3.8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics &amp;#124; Greenpeace International |publisher=Greenpeace.org |accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was the top scorer in the Energy section due to its energy advocacy work calling upon the EU to adopt a 30% reduction for [[greenhouse gas emissions]] by 2020. It is also praised for its new products which are free from [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] plastic and [[Brominated flame retardant|BFRs]]. However, the guide criticizes Phillips' sourcing of [[pulp and paper|fibres for paper]], arguing it must develop a paper procurement policy which excludes suppliers involved in [[deforestation]] and [[illegal logging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics – Greenpeace International| publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philips have made some considerable progress since 2007 (when it was first ranked in this guide), in particular by supporting the Individual Producer Responsibility principle, which means that the company is accepting the responsibility for the toxic impacts of its products on e-waste dumps around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Philips/|title=Philips Greenpeace International|publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=7 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031133232/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Philips/|archivedate=31 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pressure-induced hydration''' (PIH), also known as “super-[[hydrate|hydration]]”, is a special case of [[pressure (physics)|pressure]]-induced insertion whereby [[water]] [[molecule]]s are injected into the [[porosity|pores]] of microporous materials. In PIH, a microporous material is placed under pressure in the presence of water in the pressure-transmitting [[fluid]] of a [[diamond anvil cell]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/crystals-strange-behavior/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v2/n1/full/nmat805.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''restoration of the Everglades''' is an ongoing effort to remedy damage inflicted on the environment of southern [[Florida]] during the 20th century. It is the most expensive and comprehensive environmental repair attempt in history.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Eric (October 20, 2000). "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E3DF103EF933A15753C1A9669C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;st=nyt Everglades Restoration Plan Passes House, With Final Approval Seen]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation of the [[Everglades]] became an issue in the United States in the early 1970s after a proposal to construct an [[airport]]&lt;!--If you search Google for Miami Airport, you get the Miami Airport. If you search for Miami Jetport, you get the 1969 proposal that would have put it 6 miles north of Everglades National Park. Jetport is the correct term. --&gt; in the Big Cypress Swamp. Studies indicated the airport would have destroyed the ecosystem in [[South Florida]] and [[Everglades National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;J. V. F. (October, 1969). "Special Feature: Recent Developments in Everglades Controversy", ''BioScience'', 19 (10), pp.&amp;nbsp;926–927.&lt;/ref&gt;  After decades of destructive practices, both state and federal agencies are looking for ways to balance the needs of the [[natural environment]] in South Florida with urban and agricultural centers that have recently and rapidly grown in and near the Everglades.

In response to floods caused by hurricanes in 1947, the [[Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project]] (C&amp;SF) was established to construct flood control devices in the Everglades. The C&amp;SF built {{convert|1400|mi|km}} of canals and levees between the 1950s and 1971 throughout South Florida. Their last venture was the C-38 canal, which straightened the [[Kissimmee River]] and caused catastrophic damage to animal habitats, adversely affecting water quality in the region. The canal became the first C&amp;SF project to revert when the {{convert|22|mi|km|adj=on}} canal began to be backfilled, or refilled with the material excavated from it, in the 1980s.

When high levels of [[phosphorus]] and [[Mercury (element)#Occupational exposure|mercury]] were discovered in the waterways in 1986, [[water quality]] became a focus for water management agencies. Costly and lengthy court battles were waged between various government entities to determine who was responsible for monitoring and enforcing water quality standards. Governor [[Lawton Chiles]] proposed a bill that determined which agencies would have that responsibility, and set deadlines for pollutant levels to decrease in water. Initially the bill was criticized by conservation groups for not being strict enough on polluters, but the Everglades Forever Act was passed in 1994. Since then, the [[South Florida Water Management District]] (SFWMD) and the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] have surpassed expectations for achieving lower phosphorus levels.

A commission appointed by Governor Chiles published a report in 1995 stating that South Florida was unable to sustain its growth, and the deterioration of the environment was negatively affecting daily life for residents in South Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study that evaluated the C&amp;SF were submitted to the [[United States Congress]] in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the [[Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan]] (CERP) was enacted to restore portions of the Everglades, [[Lake Okeechobee]], the [[Caloosahatchee River]], and [[Florida Bay]] to undo the damage of the past 50&amp;nbsp;years. It would take 30&amp;nbsp;years and cost $7.8&amp;nbsp;billion to complete. Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been compromised by politics and funding problems.

==Background==
{{Main article|Draining and development of the Everglades}}

[[File:Designated areas in the Everglades.gif|thumb|250 px|alt=A color map of the lower third of the Florida peninsula showing Lake Okeechobee, compartments established by the Central &amp; Southern Florida Flood Control Project, and Everglades National Park|Compartments established by C&amp;SF projects that separated the historic Everglades into Water Conservation Areas and the Everglades Agricultural Area. Twenty-five percent of the original Everglades are preserved in [[Everglades National Park]].]]

The Everglades are part of a very large [[drainage basin|watershed]] that begins in the vicinity of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. The Okeechobee River drains into [[Lake Okeechobee]], a {{convert|730|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} lake with an average depth of {{convert|9|ft|m}}. During the wet season when the lake exceeds its capacity, the water leaves the lake in a very wide and shallow river, approximately {{convert|100|mi|km}} long and {{convert|60|mi|km}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt; This wide and shallow flow is known as ''sheetflow''. The land gradually slopes toward Florida Bay, the historical destination of most of the water leaving the Everglades. Before drainage attempts, the Everglades comprised {{convert|4000|sqmi|km2}}, taking up a third of the Florida peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 19th century the Everglades have been a subject of interest for agricultural development. The first attempt to drain the Everglades occurred in 1882 when a [[Pennsylvania]] land developer named [[Hamilton Disston]] constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, Disston's purchase of land spurred tourism and real estate development of the state. The political motivations of Governor [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]] resulted in more successful attempts at canal construction between 1906 and 1920. Recently reclaimed [[wetland]]s were used for cultivating [[sugarcane]] and vegetables, while urban development began in the Everglades.&lt;ref name="dovell"&gt;Dovell, Junius (July 1948). "The Everglades: A Florida Frontier", ''Agricultural History'' '''22''' (3), pp.&amp;nbsp;187–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1926 Miami Hurricane]] and the [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane]] caused widespread devastation and flooding which prompted the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] to construct a dike around Lake Okeechobee. The four-story wall cut off water from the Everglades. Floods from hurricanes in 1947 motivated the U.S. Congress to establish the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project (C&amp;SF), responsible for constructing {{convert|1400|mi|km}} of canals and levees, hundreds of pumping stations and other water control devices. The C&amp;SF established Water Conservation Areas (WCAs) in 37% of the original Everglades, which acted as reservoirs providing excess water to the [[South Florida metropolitan area]], or flushing it into the Atlantic Ocean or the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Light, Stephen, J. Walter Dineen "Water Control in the Everglades: A Historical Perspective" in ''Everglades: The Ecosystem and its Restoration'', Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. (1994), St. Lucie Press. {{ISBN|0-9634030-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The C&amp;SF also established the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), which grows the majority of sugarcane crops in the United States. When the EAA was first established, it encompassed approximately 27% of the original Everglades.

By the 1960s, urban development and agricultural use had decreased the size of the Everglades considerably. The remaining 25% of the Everglades in its original state is protected in [[Everglades National Park]], but the park was established before the C&amp;SF, and it depended upon the actions of the C&amp;SF to release water. As Miami and other metropolitan areas began to intrude on the Everglades in the 1960s, political battles took place between park management and the C&amp;SF when insufficient water in the park threw ecosystems into chaos. Fertilizers used in the EAA began to alter soil and [[hydrology]] in Everglades National Park, causing the proliferation of exotic plant species.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder G.H., J. Davidson, "Everglades Agriculture: Past, Present and Future" in ''Everglades: The Ecosystem and its Restoration'', Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. (1994), St. Lucie Press. {{ISBN|0-9634030-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a proposition to build a massive jetport in the Big Cypress Swamp in 1969  focused attention on the degraded natural systems in the Everglades. For the first time, the Everglades became a subject of environmental conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Marti (October 10, 1969).

==Everglades as a priority==
Environmental protection became a national priority in the 1970s. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine declared it the Issue of the Year in January 1971, reporting that it was rated as Americans' "most serious problem confronting their community—well ahead of crime, drugs and poor schools".&lt;ref&gt;

===Kissimmee River===
In the 1960s, the C&amp;SF came under increased scrutiny from government overseers and conservation groups. Critics maintained its size was comparable to the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s dam-building projects during the [[Great Depression]], and that the construction had run into the billions of dollars without any apparent resolution or plan.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Jack (January 2003). "'Conservation is now a dead word': Marjory Stoneman Douglas and the transformation of American environmentalism." ''Environmental History'', '''8''' (1) pp.&amp;nbsp;53–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The projects of the C&amp;SF have been characterized as part of "crisis and response" cycles that "ignored the consequence for the full system, assumed certainty of the future, and succeeded in solving the momentary crisis, but set in motion conditions that exaggerate future crises".&lt;ref name="holling"&gt;Holling, C.S.

[[Marjory Stoneman Douglas]] later wrote that the C&amp;SF projects were "interrelated stupidity", crowned by the C-38 canal.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas (1987), p.&amp;nbsp;229.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed to replace a meandering {{convert|90|mi|km|adj=on}} river with a {{convert|52|mi|km|adj=on}} channel, the canal was completed in 1971 and cost $29&amp;nbsp;million.

Arthur R. Marshall led the efforts to undo the damage. According to Douglas, Marshall was successful in portraying the Everglades from the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes to [[Florida Bay]]&amp;mdash;including the atmosphere, climate, and limestone&amp;mdash;as a single organism. Rather than remaining the preserve of conservation organizations, the cause of restoring the Everglades became a priority for politicians. Douglas observed, "Marshall accomplished the extraordinary magic of taking the Everglades out of the bleeding-hearts category forever".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas (1987), p.&amp;nbsp;227.&lt;/ref&gt; At the insistent urging of Marshall, newly elected Governor [[Bob Graham]] announced the formation of the "Save Our Everglades" campaign in 1983, and in 1985 Graham lifted the first shovel of backfill for a portion of the C-38 canal.&lt;ref name="angier"&gt;

==Water quality==
[[File:Cattails in the Everglades.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A color photograph of cattails growing in the Everglades|[[Typha|Cattails]] indicate the presence of [[phosphorus]] in the water. Cattails are an invasive species; they crowd out [[Cladium|sawgrass]] and grow too thick for birds or alligators to nest in.]]

Attention to water quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a widespread [[algal bloom]] occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered to be the result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;230.&lt;/ref&gt; Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake.&lt;ref name="gunderson"/&gt; Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys [[periphyton]], one of the basic building blocks of [[marl]] in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with [[peat]]; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive [[Typha|cattails]] that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Steven. "Phosphorus Inputs and Vegetation Sensitivity in the Everglades" in ''Everglades: The Ecosystem and its Restoration'', Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. (1994), St. Lucie Press. {{ISBN|0-9634030-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tested water showed 500&amp;nbsp;parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of [[phosphorus]] by 1992.

Attempts to correct phosphorus levels in the Everglades met with resistance. The sugarcane industry, dominated by two companies named [[US Sugar Corporation|U.S. Sugar]] and [[Flo-Sun]], was responsible for more than half of the crop in the EAA. They were well represented in state and federal governments by [[lobbyist]]s who enthusiastically protected their interests. According to the Audubon Society, the sugar industry, nicknamed "Big Sugar", donated more money to political parties and candidates than [[General Motors]].&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;282.&lt;/ref&gt; The sugar industry attempted to block government-funded studies of polluted water, and when the federal prosecutor in Miami faulted the sugar industry in legal action to protect Everglades National Park, Big Sugar tried to get the lawsuit withdrawn and the prosecutor fired.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, pp.&amp;nbsp;286–287.&lt;/ref&gt; A costly legal battle ensued from 1988 to 1992 between the State of Florida, the U.S. government, and the sugar industry to resolve who was responsible for water quality standards, the maintenance of Everglades National Park and the [[Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref name="gunderson"/&gt;

A different concern about water quality arose when [[Mercury (element)#Occupational exposure|mercury]] was discovered in fish during the 1980s. Because mercury is damaging to humans, warnings were posted for fishermen that cautioned against eating fish caught in South Florida, and scientists became alarmed when a [[Florida panther]] was found dead near Shark River Slough with mercury levels high enough to be fatal to humans.&lt;ref name="lodgemercury"&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;231–233.&lt;/ref&gt; When mercury is ingested it adversely affects the central nervous system, and can cause brain damage and birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;

The dead panther's diet consisted of small animals, including [[raccoon]]s and young alligators. The source of the mercury was found to be waste incinerators and [[fossil fuel]] power plants that expelled the element in the atmosphere, which precipitated with rain, or in the dry season, dust.&lt;ref name="lodgemercury"/&gt; Naturally occurring bacteria in the Everglades that function to reduce [[sulfur]] also transform mercury deposits into [[methylmercury]]. This process was more dramatic in areas where flooding was not as prevalent. Because of [[US emission standard|requirements]] that reduced power plant and incinerator emissions, the levels of mercury found in larger animals decreased as well: approximately a 60% decrease in fish and a 70% decrease in birds, though some levels still remain a health concern for people.&lt;ref name="lodgemercury"/&gt;

In an attempt to resolve the political quagmire over water quality, Governor [[Lawton Chiles]] introduced a bill in 1994 to clean up water within the EAA that was being released to the lower Everglades. The bill stated that the "Everglades ecosystem must be restored both in terms of water quality and water quantity and must be preserved and protected in a manner that is long term and comprehensive".&lt;ref name="efa"&gt;

Critics of the bill argued that the deadline for meeting the standards was unnecessarily delayed until 2006—a period of 12&amp;nbsp;years—to enforce better water quality. They also maintained that it did not force sugarcane farmers, who were the primary polluters, to pay enough of the costs, and increased the threshold of what was an acceptable amount of phosphorus in water from 10&amp;nbsp;ppb to 50&amp;nbsp;ppb.&lt;ref name="grunwald301"&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;301.&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Chiles initially named it the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Act, but Douglas was so unimpressed with the action it took against polluters that she wrote to Chiles and demanded her name be stricken from it.&lt;ref name="grunwald301"/&gt; Despite criticism, the Florida legislature passed the Act in 1994.

==Wildlife concerns==
The intrusion of urban areas into wilderness has had a substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (''[[Alligator mississippiensis]]''), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator [[hunting]] allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 and is no longer an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/species/species_accounts/bio_alli.html |title=American Alligator, Wildlife Species Information |publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] |accessdate=2008-07-12 |work=www.fws.gov |date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, alligators' territories and average body masses have been found to be generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;236.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Crocodile (''[[Crocodylus acutus]]'') is also native to the region and has been designated as endangered since 1975. Unlike their relatives the alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in brackish or salt-water habitats such as [[estuarine]] or marine coasts. Their most significant threat is disturbance by people. Too much contact with humans causes females to abandon their nests, and males in particular are often victims of vehicle collisions while roaming over large territories and attempting to cross [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|U.S. 1]] and Card Sound Road in the [[Florida Keys]].

The most [[critically endangered]] of any animal in the Everglades region is the Florida panther (''[[Puma concolor coryi]]''), a species that once lived throughout the southeastern United States: there were only 25–30 in the wild in 1995. The panther is most threatened by urban encroachment, because males require approximately {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}} for breeding territory. A male and two to five females may live within that range. When habitat is lost, panthers will fight over territory. After vehicle collisions, the second most frequent cause of death for panthers is intra-species aggression.&lt;ref name="fpnwr"/&gt; In the 1990s urban expansion crowded panthers from southwestern Florida as [[Naples, Florida|Naples]] and [[Ft. Myers, Florida|Ft. Myers]] began to expand into the western Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp. Agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers and the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] were responsible for maintaining the [[Clean Water Act]] and the [[Endangered Species Act]], yet still approved 99% of all permits to build in wetlands and panther territory.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;293.&lt;/ref&gt; A limited genetic pool is also a danger. Biologists introduced eight female Texas cougars (''[[Puma concolor]]'') in 1995 to diversify genes, and there are between 80 and 120&amp;nbsp;panthers in the wild {{as of|2008|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name="fpnwr"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Florida Panther Frequently Asked Questions  | work = Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge  | publisher = U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service  | url = http://www.fws.gov/floridapanther/panther_faq.html  | accessdate = 2008-05-24  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080524182847/http://www.fws.gov/floridapanther/panther_faq.html  | archivedate = 2008-05-24  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most dramatic loss of any group of animals has been to [[Wader|wading birds]]. Their numbers were estimated by eyewitness accounts to be approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;million in the late 19th century. However, snowy egrets (''[[Egretta thula]]''), roseate spoonbills (''[[Platalea ajaja]]''), and reddish egrets (''[[Egretta rufescens]]'') were hunted to the brink of extinction for the colorful feathers used in women's hats. After about 1920 when the fashion passed, their numbers returned in the 1930s, but over the next 50&amp;nbsp;years actions by the C&amp;SF further disturbed populations. When the canals were constructed, natural water flow was restricted from the mangrove forests near the coast of Florida Bay. From one wet season to the next, fish were unable to reach traditional locations to repopulate when water was withheld by the C&amp;SF. Birds were forced to fly farther from their nests to forage for food. By the 1970s, bird numbers had decreased 90%. Many of the birds moved to smaller colonies in the WCAs to be closer to a food source, making them more difficult to count. Yet they remain significantly fewer in number than before the canals were constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, G. Thomas, et al.

===Invasive species===
{{Main article|List of invasive species in the Everglades}}

Around 6&amp;nbsp;million people moved to South Florida between 1940 and 1965. With a thousand people moving to Miami each week, urban development quadrupled.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;229.&lt;/ref&gt; As the human population grew rapidly, the problem of exotic plant and animal species also grew. Many species of plants were brought into South Florida from [[Asia]], [[Central America]], or [[Australia]] as decorative landscaping. Exotic animals imported by the pet trade have escaped or been released. Biological controls that keep invasive species smaller in size and fewer in number in their native lands often do not exist in the Everglades, and they compete with the embattled native species for food and space. Of imported plant species, melaleuca trees (''[[Melaleuca quinquenervia]]'') have caused the most problems. Melaleucas grow on average {{convert|100|ft|m}} in the Everglades, as opposed to {{convert|25|to|60|ft|m}} in their native Australia. They were brought to southern Florida as [[windbreak]]s and deliberately seeded in marsh areas because they absorb vast amounts of water. In a region that is regularly shaped by fire, melaleucas are fire-resistant and their seeds are more efficiently spread by fire. They are too dense for wading birds with large wingspans to nest in, and they choke out native vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–240.&lt;/ref&gt; Costs of controlling melaleucas topped $2&amp;nbsp;million in 1998 for Everglades National Park. In Big Cypress National Preserve, melaleucas covered {{convert|186|sqmi|km2}}  at their most pervasive in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Tasker, Georgia (August 22, 1998). "Federal Experts Warn of Alien Plant Invasion", ''The Miami Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ARS Lygodium microphyllum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A color photograph of several large trees overtaken by old world climbing ferns all the way to the top|Climbing [[fern]]s overtake [[cypress tree]]s in the Everglades. The ferns act as "fire ladders" that can destroy trees that would otherwise survive fires.]]

Brazilian pepper (''[[Schinus terebinthifolius]]'') was brought to Southern Florida as an ornamental shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds and other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] and has invaded pineland forests. Following [[Hurricane Andrew]], scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees would be able to return to their natural state.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt;

The species that is causing the most impediment to restoration is the Old World climbing fern (''[[Lygodium microphyllum]]''), introduced in 1965. The fern grows rapidly and thickly on the ground, making passage for land animals such as black bears and panthers problematic. The ferns also grow as vines into taller portions of trees, and fires climb the ferns in "fire ladders" to scorch portions of the trees that are not naturally resistant to fire.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several animal species have been introduced to Everglades waterways. Many tropical fish are released, the most detrimental being the blue tilapia (''[[Oreochromis aureus]]''), which builds large nests in shallow waters. Tilapia also consume vegetation which would normally be used by young native fishes for cover and protection.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;243–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reptiles have a particular affinity for the South Florida ecosystem. Virtually all lizards appearing in the Everglades have been introduced, such as the brown anole (''[[Anolis sagrei]]'') and the tropical house gecko (''[[Hemidactylus mabouia]]''). The [[herbivore|herbivorous]] green iguana (''[[Iguana iguana]]'') can reproduce rapidly in wilderness habitats.  However,        the reptile that has earned media attention for its size and potential to harm children and domestic pets is the Burmese python (''[[Python bivittatus]]''), which has spread quickly throughout the area. The python can grow up to {{convert|20|ft|m}} long and competes with alligators for the top of the [[food chain]].&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though exotic birds such as parrots and parakeets are also found in the Everglades, their impact is negligible. Conversely, perhaps the animal that causes the most damage to native wildlife is the domestic or feral cat. Across the U.S., cats are responsible for approximately a billion bird deaths annually. They are estimated to number 640 per square mile; cats living in suburban areas have devastating effects on migratory birds and marsh rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;244–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homestead Air Force Base===
[[Hurricane Andrew]] struck Miami in 1992, with catastrophic damage to [[Homestead Air Force Base]] in [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]]. A plan to rejuvenate the property in 1993 and convert it into a commercial airport was met with enthusiasm from local municipal and commercial entities hoping to recoup $480&amp;nbsp;million and 11,000&amp;nbsp;jobs lost in the local community by the destruction and subsequent closing of the base.&lt;ref&gt;

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A cursory environmental study performed by the Air Force was deemed insufficient by local conservation groups, who threatened to sue in order to halt the acquisition when estimates of 650&amp;nbsp;flights a day were projected. Groups had previously been alarmed in 1990 by the inclusion of Homestead Air Force Base on a list of the U.S. Government's most polluted properties.&lt;ref&gt;Zaneski, Cyril (August 24, 1998). "New Environmental Study Begins on Homestead, Fla., Airport Project", ''The Miami Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; Their concerns also included noise, and the inevitable collisions with birds using the mangrove forests as rookeries. The Air Force base is located between Everglades National Park and [[Biscayne National Park]], giving it the potential to cause harm to both. In 2000, [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Bruce Babbitt]] and the director of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] expressed their opposition to the project, despite other [[Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] agencies previously working to ensure the base would be turned over to local agencies quickly and smoothly as "a model of base disposal".&lt;ref&gt;Zaneski, Cyril (January 8, 2000).

Although attempts were made to make the base more environmentally friendly, in 2001 local commercial interests promoting the airport lost federal support.

==Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan==

===Sustainable South Florida===
Despite the successes of the Everglades Forever Act and the decreases in mercury levels, the focus intensified on the Everglades in the 1990s as quality of life in the South Florida metropolitan areas diminished. It was becoming clear that urban populations were consuming increasingly unsustainable levels of natural resources. A report entitled "The Governor's Commission for a Sustainable South Florida", submitted to Lawton Chiles in 1995, identified the problems the state and municipal governments were facing. The report remarked that the degradation of the natural quality of the Everglades, Florida Bay, and other bodies of water in South Florida would cause a significant decrease in tourism (12,000&amp;nbsp;jobs and $200&amp;nbsp;million annually) and income from compromised commercial fishing (3,300&amp;nbsp;jobs and $52&amp;nbsp;million annually).&lt;ref name="sustainable"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report noted that past abuses and neglect of the environment had brought the region to "a precipitous juncture" where the inhabitants of South Florida faced health hazards in polluted air and water; furthermore, crowded and unsafe urban conditions hurt the reputation of the state. It noted that though the population had increased by 90% over the previous two decades, registered vehicles had increased by 166%.&lt;ref name="sustainable"/&gt; On the quality and availability of water, the report stated, "[The] frequent water shortages&amp;nbsp;... create the irony of a natural system dying of thirst in a subtropical environment with over 53 inches of rain per year".&lt;ref name="sustainable"/&gt;

Restoration of the Everglades, however, briefly became a [[bipartisan]] cause in national politics. A controversial penny-a-pound (2 cent/kg) tax on sugar was proposed to fund some of the necessary changes to be made to help decrease phosphorus and make other improvements to water. State voters were asked to support the tax, and environmentalists paid $15&amp;nbsp;million to encourage the issue. Sugar lobbyists responded with $24&amp;nbsp;million in advertising to discourage it and succeeded; it became the most expensive ballot issue in state history.&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;

However, in the 1996 election year, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] senator [[Bob Dole]] proposed that Congress give the State of Florida $200&amp;nbsp;million to acquire land for the Everglades. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Vice President [[Al Gore]] promised the federal government would purchase {{convert|100000|acre|km2}} of land in the EAA to turn it over for restoration. Politicking reduced the number to {{convert|50000|acre|km2}}, but both Dole's and Gore's gestures were approved by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, pp.&amp;nbsp;311–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Water Resources Development Act of 1992, Congress authorized an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project. A report known as the "Restudy", written by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, was submitted to Congress in 1999. It cited indicators of harm to the system: a 50% reduction in the original Everglades, diminished water storage, harmful timing of water release, an 85 to 90% decrease in wading bird populations over the past 50&amp;nbsp;years, and the decline of output from commercial fisheries. Bodies of water including [[Lake Okeechobee]], the [[Caloosahatchee River]], [[St. Lucie River|St. Lucie]] estuary, [[Lake Worth Lagoon]], [[Biscayne Bay]], [[Florida Bay]], and the Everglades reflected drastic water level changes, [[salinity|hypersalinity]], and dramatic changes in marine and freshwater ecosystems. The Restudy noted the overall decline in water quality over the past 50&amp;nbsp;years was caused by loss of wetlands that act as filters for polluted water.&lt;ref&gt;US Army COE and SFWMD, p.&amp;nbsp;iii.&lt;/ref&gt; It predicted that without intervention the entire South Florida ecosystem would deteriorate. Canals took roughly {{convert|170|e9USgal}} of water to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico daily, so there was no opportunity for water storage, yet flooding was still a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Tibbetts, John (August, 2000). "Making Amends: Ecological Restoration in the United States", ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', '''108''' (8), pp.&amp;nbsp;A356–A361.&lt;/ref&gt; Without changes to the current system, the Restudy predicted [[water restriction]]s would be necessary every other year, and annually in some locations. It also warned that revising some portions of the project without dedicating efforts to an overall comprehensive plan would be insufficient and probably detrimental.&lt;ref&gt;US Army COE and SFWMD, pp.&amp;nbsp;iv–v.&lt;/ref&gt;

After evaluating ten plans, the Restudy recommended a comprehensive strategy that would cost $7.8&amp;nbsp;billion over 20&amp;nbsp;years. The plan advised taking the following actions:
* '''Create surface water storage reservoirs''' to capture {{convert|1500000|acre.ft|km3}} of water in several locations taking up {{convert|181300|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name="pvii"&gt;US Army COE and SFWMD, p.&amp;nbsp;vii.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Create water preserve areas''' between Miami-Dade and Palm Beach and the eastern Everglades to treat runoff water.&lt;ref name="pvii"/&gt;
* '''Manage Lake Okeechobee as an ecological resource''' to avoid the drastic rise and fall of water levels in the lake that are harmful to aquatic plant and animal life and disturb the lake sediments.&lt;ref name="pvii"/&gt;
* '''Improve water deliveries to estuaries''' to reduce the rapid discharge of excess water to the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries that upset nutrient balances and cause lesions on fish. Stormwater discharge would be sent instead to reservoirs.&lt;ref name="pviii"&gt;US Army COE and SFWMD, p.&amp;nbsp;viii.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Increase underground water storage''' to hold {{convert|16|e9USgal}} a day in wells, or reservoirs in the [[Floridan Aquifer]], to be used later in dry periods, in a method called [[Aquifer]] Storage and Recovery (ASR).&lt;ref name="pviii"/&gt;
* '''Construct treatment wetlands''' as Stormwater Treatment Areas throughout {{convert|35600|acre|km2}}, that would decrease the amount of pollutants in the environment.&lt;ref name="pviii"/&gt;
* '''Improve water deliveries''' to the Everglades by increasing them at a rate of approximately 26% into Shark River Slough.&lt;ref name="pviii"/&gt;
* '''Remove barriers to sheetflow''' by destroying or removing {{convert|240|mi|km}} of canals and levees, specifically removing the Miami Canal and reconstructing the [[Tamiami Trail]] from a highway to culverts and bridges to allow sheetflow to return to a more natural rate of water flow into Everglades National Park.&lt;ref name="ix"&gt;US Army COE and SFWMD, p.&amp;nbsp;ix.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Store water in quarries and reuse wastewater''' by employing existing [[quarry|quarries]] to supply the South Florida metropolitan area as well as Florida Bay and the Everglades. Construct two wastewater treatment plants capable of discharging {{convert|22|e9USgal}} a day to recharge the [[Biscayne Aquifer]].&lt;ref name="ix"/&gt;

The implementation of all of the advised actions, the report stated, would "result in the recovery of healthy, sustainable ecosystems throughout south Florida".&lt;ref&gt;US Army COE and SFWMD, p.&amp;nbsp;x.&lt;/ref&gt; The report admitted that it did not have all the answers, though no plan could.&lt;ref name="pxi"&gt;US Army COE and SFWMD, p.&amp;nbsp;xi.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it predicted that it would restore the "essential defining features of the pre-drainage wetlands over large portions of the remaining system", that populations of all animals would increase, and animal distribution patterns would return to their natural states.&lt;ref name="pxi"/&gt; Critics expressed concern over some unused technology; scientists were unsure if the quarries would hold as much water as was being suggested, and whether the water would harbor harmful bacteria from the quarries. Overtaxing the aquifers was another concern—it was not a technique that had been previously attempted.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it was optimistic, the Restudy noted, &lt;blockquote&gt;It is important to understand that the 'restored' Everglades of the future will be different from any version of the Everglades that has existed in the past. While it certainly will be vastly superior to the current ecosystem, it will not completely match the pre-drainage system. This is not possible, in light of the irreversible physical changes that have made (''sic'') to the ecosystem. It will be an Everglades that is smaller and somewhat differently arranged than the historic ecosystem. But it will be a successfully restored Everglades, because it will have recovered those hydrological and biological patterns which defined the  original Everglades, and which made it unique among the world’s wetland systems. It will become a place that kindles the wildness and richness of the former Everglades.&lt;ref name="xii"&gt;US Army COE and SFWMD, p.&amp;nbsp;xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report was the result of many cooperating agencies that often had conflicting goals. An initial draft was submitted to Everglades National Park management who asserted not enough water would be released to the park quickly enough—that the priority went to delivering water to urban areas. When they threatened to refuse to support it, the plan was rewritten to provide more water to the park. However, the [[Miccosukee]] Indians have a reservation in between the park and water control devices, and they threatened to sue to ensure their tribal lands and a $50&amp;nbsp;million casino would not be flooded.&lt;ref&gt;Kloor, Keith (May 19, 2000). "Everglades Restoration Plan Hits Rough Waters", ''Science'', '''288''' (5469), pp.&amp;nbsp;1166–1167.&lt;/ref&gt; Other special interests were also concerned that businesses and residents would take second priority after nature. The Everglades, however, proved to be a bipartisan cause. The [[Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan]] (CERP) was authorized by the [[Water Resources Development Act of 2000]] and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000. It approved the immediate use of $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion for implementation to be split by the federal government and other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Implementation===
The State of Florida reports that it has spent more than $2&amp;nbsp;billion on the various projects since CERP was signed. More than {{convert|36000|acre|km2}} of Stormwater Treatment Areas (STA) have been constructed to filter {{convert|2500|ST|MT}} of phosphorus from Everglades waters. An STA covering {{convert|17000|acre|km2}} was constructed in 2004, making it the largest manmade wetland in the world. Fifty-five percent of the land necessary for restoration, totaling {{convert|210167|acre|km2|1}}, has been purchased by the State of Florida. A plan named "Acceler8", to hasten the construction and funding of the project, was put into place, spurring the start of six of eight construction projects, including that of three large reservoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite the bipartisan goodwill and declarations of the importance of the Everglades, the region still remains in danger. Political maneuvering continues to impede CERP: sugar lobbyists promoted a bill in the Florida legislature in 2003 that increased the acceptable amount of phosphorus in Everglades waterways from 10&amp;nbsp;ppb to 15&amp;nbsp;ppb and extended the deadline for the mandated decrease by 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;(April 21, 2003).

Environmental organizations express concern that attempts to speed up some of the construction through Acceler8 are politically motivated; the six projects Acceler8 focuses on do not provide more water to natural areas in desperate need of it, but rather to projects in populated areas bordering the Everglades, suggesting that water is being diverted to make room for more people in an already overtaxed environment.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, Michael (October 14, 2004).

===Reassessment of CERP===
Florida still receives a thousand new residents daily and lands slated for restoration and wetland recovery are often bought and sold before the state has a chance to bid on them. The competitive pricing of real estate also drives it beyond the purchasing ability of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p.&amp;nbsp;185.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Because the State of Florida is assisting with purchasing lands and funding construction, some of the programs under CERP are vulnerable to state budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;Fineout, Gary (April 4, 2008). "Deep budget cuts in store for S. Florida", ''The Miami Herald'', State and Regional News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klas, Mary Ellen (June 12, 2008).

Retrieved on June 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008 Governor Crist announced that the State of Florida will buy [[US Sugar Corporation|U.S. Sugar]] for $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion. The idea came when sugar lobbyists were trying to persuade Crist to relax restriction of U.S. Sugar's practice of pumping phosphorus-laden water into the Everglades. According to one of the lobbyists who characterized it as a "duh moment", Crist said, "If sugar is polluting the Everglades, and we're paying to clean the Everglades, why don't we just get rid of sugar?"&lt;ref name="kennedy"/&gt; The largest producer of cane sugar in the U.S. will continue operations for six years, and when ownership transfers to Florida, {{convert|187000|acre|km2}} of the Everglades will remain undeveloped to allow it to be restored to its pre-drainage state.&lt;ref&gt;Cave, Damien and John Holusha (June 25, 2008). "Florida to Buy Sugar Maker in Bid to Restore Everglades", ''The New York Times'', p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008 the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC), a nonprofit agency providing science and policy advice to the federal government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.nationalacademies.org/nrc/index.htm Welcome to the National Research Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128094308/http://sites.nationalacademies.org/NRC/index.htm |date=2010-11-28 }}, National Research Council website (2008). Retrieved on October 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; submitted a report on the progress of CERP. The report noted "scant progress" in restoration because of problems in budgeting, planning, and bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="nrc2008"&gt;[http://dels.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/everglades_brief_final.pdf "Progress Toward Restoring the Everglades: Second Biennial Review (Brief)"], National Research Council (September 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The NRC report called the Everglades one of the "world's treasured ecosystems" that is being further endangered by lack of progress: "Ongoing delay in Everglades restoration has not only postponed improvements—it has allowed ecological decline to continue". It cited the shrinking [[Geography and ecology of the Everglades#Tropical hardwood hammock|tree islands]], and the negative population growth of the endangered ''[[Rostrhamus sociabilis]]'' or Everglades snail kite, and ''[[Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis]]'', the Cape Sable seaside sparrow. The lack of water reaching Everglades National Park was characterized as "one of the most discouraging stories" in implementation of the plan.&lt;ref name="nrc2008"/&gt; The NRC recommended improving planning on the state and federal levels, evaluating each CERP project annually, and further acquisition of land for restoration. Everglades restoration was earmarked $96 million in federal funds as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] with the intention of providing civil service and construction jobs while simultaneously implementing the legislated repair projects.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Curtis, Clark, Lesley (April 29, 2009). "River of Cash: Stimulus Aid for Glades", ''The Miami Herald'', p1A.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, work began on the C-111 canal, built in the 1960s to drain irrigated farmland, to reconstruct it to keep from diverting water from Everglades National Park. Two other projects focusing on restoration were also scheduled to start in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Curtis (January 27, 2010). "Canal work begins in Everglades project", ''The Miami Herald'', South Florida news.&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Crist announced the same month that $50 million would be earmarked for Everglades restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Skoloff, Brian (January 22, 2010). "Gov. Crist proposes $2.1 billion for environment", ''The Miami Herald'', Florida news.&lt;/ref&gt; In April of the same year, a federal district court judge sharply criticized both state and federal failures to meet deadlines, describing the cleanup efforts as being slowed by "glacial delay" and government neglect of environmental law enforcement "incomprehensible".&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Curtis (April 25, 2010). "Everglades cleanup said to be mired in 'glacial delay'", ''The Miami Herald'', South Florida news.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Risø DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy ''' ({{lang-da|Risø DTU Nationallaboratoriet for Bæredygtig Energi}}) was a scientific [[research]] organization north of [[Roskilde]], [[Denmark]].

The Risø DTU organisation was founded in 1956 and dissolved on 1 January 2012. The location is now known as DTU Risø Campus and the buildings are home to a number of institutes under the [[Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU) and separately is also home to [[Aarhus University]] [http://envs.au.dk/en/ Dept of Environmental Science] and part of [http://bios.au.dk/en/ Dept of Bioscience]. Risø covers an area of more than 2.6 square kilometres.

== Organisation ==
From 1 January 2008, it was made an institute of the [[Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU). On 1 January 2007, the Technical University of Denmark merged with the [[Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary Research]], the [[Danish Institute for Fisheries Research]], [[Danish National Space Center]], the [[Danish Transport Research Institute]] and Risø National Laboratory. Before this, Risø National Laboratory was a research institute under the Danish [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Denmark)|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]] and consisted of eight research departments: [[Biosystem]]s, [[Polymer]] Department, [[Fuel Cell]]s and [[Solid-state chemistry|Solid State Chemistry]], [[materials science|Materials Research]], [[Optics]] and [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] Research, [[Radiation]] Research, [[Systems Analysis]] and [[Wind Energy]].

== History ==
Risø was founded in 1956, but not officially inaugurated until 1958. [[Niels Bohr]] played a key role in the founding of Risø and was [[chairman]] of the Nuclear Energy Commission charged to promote the peaceful use of nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Til samfundets tarv - Forskningscenter Risøs historie |editor=Henry Nielsen|year=1998|isbn=87-550-2380-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of Risø was "to create new knowledge based on world-class research, and to ensure that our knowledge is used to promote the development of an innovative and sustainable society" (from the web page).

Risø is the site of three research nuclear reactors: DR-1, DR-2 and DR-3. DR-3 is a [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO]] class [[nuclear reactor]]. All reactors are shut down and undergoing decommissioning.

Risø was in its later years{{When|date=January 2018}} particularly noted for its involvement in [[wind energy]] and [[solid-oxide fuel cells]].

Risø had strong competences in [[climate change]] effects studies and had "state of the art" facilities for realistic climate change experiments and monitoring. These included
* '''RERAF''' (Risø Environmental Risk Assessment facility) - a phytotrone controlled environment growth facility.
* '''Sorø beech forest'''. A field station in an 80-year-old beech forest measuring carbon inputs, outputs and turnover processes by advanced techniques (e.g. [[eddy covariance]]).
*'''[[CLIMAITE]]''' - Climate change effects on biological processes in terrestrial ecosystems. A field scale climate change experiment conducting multifactor experiments with elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, night time warming and altered precipitation.

The organization employed about 700 staff (660 person-years) in 2005.

On 1 January 2012 Risø DTU was dissolved. The location is now called DTU Risø Campus and is home to a number of DTU institutes.

== Collaborators and users ==
*[[National Environmental Research Institute of Denmark]] ({{lang-da|Danmarks Miljøundersøgelser (DMU}})) The Risø area also house National Environmental Research Institute (NERI) part of the Danish [[University of Aarhus]]. NERI is "an independent research faculty under University of Aarhus. NERI undertakes scientific consultancy work, monitoring of nature and the environment as well as applied and strategic research. NERI’s task is to establish a scientific foundation for environmental policy decisions"
*[[DTU Fotonik]] also use some of the facilities, as a part of the ''Optics and Plasma Research'' department was transferred this institute as part of the merger.

==WAsP==
Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP) is a tool used in the [[wind energy]] industry to simulate wind flow over terrain and estimate the long-term energy production of [[wind turbine]]s and [[wind farm]]s. It has been in development by Risø National Laboratory for over 25 years, and runs on PCs using [[Microsoft Windows]].  The name WAsP is short for WAAAP ("W, some As, and a P"), the acronym of the software name. Current version is 12.0 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wasp.dk/ The official site of WAsP]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18198">A '''sacred natural site''' is a natural feature or a large area of land or water having special [[Spirituality|spiritual]] significance to peoples and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Oviedo, G. and Jeanrenaud, S. (2007) 'Protecting sacred natural sites of indigenous and traditional peoples', in Mallarach, J.M. and Papayannis, T. (eds) (2007) Protected Areas and Spirituality, IUCN and Publicacions de l'Abadia de Montserrat, Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred natural sites consist of all types of natural features including mountains, hills, forests, [[Sacred grove|groves]], [[Tree worship|trees]], rivers, lakes, lagoons, caves, islands and springs. The interest in sacred natural sites, from the perspective of [[nature conservation]], lies in the component of [[biological diversity]] that they harbor.

== Overview ==
Sacred natural sites are natural features in or areas of land or water having special spiritual significance to peoples and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Wild, R and McLeod, C (eds) (2008) 'Sacred Natural Sites: Guidelines for Protected Area Managers'. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN&lt;/ref&gt; This working definition is broad and can be used as a basis for more specific articulations. Whilst “sacred natural sites” is the main term used, for reasons of variety and readability, other terms are used interchangeably, including [[sacred site]], [[sacred place]] and sacred area.

The interest in sacred natural sites from the perspective of [[nature conservation]] lies in the components of [[biological diversity]] that they harbour, such as the species of animals and plants, the [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, as well as the ecological dynamics and functions that support life within and outside the places. Linked to such biological diversity is the array of distinct [[human culture]]s that care for them and hold them sacred.&lt;ref name=v&gt;Verschuuren, B., Wild, R., McNeely, J., Oviedo G. (eds.), 2010. Sacred Natural Sites, Conserving Culture and Nature. EarthScan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacred natural sites consist of all types of natural features including mountains, hills, forests, groves, rivers, lakes, lagoons, caves, islands and springs. They can vary in size from the very small: an individual tree, small spring, or a single rock formation, to whole landscapes and mountain ranges.  They consist of [[geological formation]]s, distinct [[landform]]s, specific [[ecosystem]]s and [[natural habitat]]s.  They are predominantly [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] but are also found in inshore [[Ocean|marine]] areas, [[island]]s and [[archipelago]]s.  They may also be the location of [[temple]]s, [[shrine]]s, [[mosque]]s and [[Church (building)|church]]es, and they can incorporate other features such as [[pilgrimage]] trails.  In some sites nature is itself sacred, while in others sanctity is conferred by connections with spiritual heroes, religious structures or sacred histories.

== Sacred natural sites and religion==
Sacred natural sites are just one of many domains where religions or belief systems interact with nature. Most if not all religions have [[mythology]], [[cosmology]], [[theology]] or [[ethics]] related to earth, nature and land. Contemporarily, such connections are increasingly being revived or rearticulated through ethical positions expressed for example in statements that many of the mainstream faiths have produced, setting out their relationship to the natural world and their responsibility towards the planet.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Sacred sites associated with living cultures always have institutions and rules associated with them. These institutions are usually religious or spiritual in nature and may be distinct from other parts of society, while in some communities of indigenous and traditional peoples, sacred site institutions are closely integrated within society with little distinction between the sacred and secular, the religious and civil.

The vast majority of sacred natural sites were arguably founded by indigenous or [[folk religion]]s and [[spirituality|spiritualities]], but many were subsequently adopted or co-opted by mainstream religions. There is consequently a considerable 'layering' and mixing of religious and other spiritual or belief systems. Within the larger mainstream religions there are many if not more autonomous or semi-autonomous sub-groups. While fifty per cent of the world's population profess to belong to either [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] and many others are [[Hindu]]s or [[Buddhist]]s, 80 per cent of all people ascribe to a mainstream religion, a large part of which continue to adhere to at least some traditional or [[folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. and Palmer, M. (1997)'The Atlas of Religion', University of California Press, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred natural sites are thus connected to a wide range of socio-cultural systems and institutions, some more complex than others, and to different dynamics of change and cultural interaction.

==Sacred natural sites, indigenous peoples and mainstream faiths==
Establishing a duality between '[[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]', in the sense of being native or belonging to a place, and 'mainstream', while pragmatic for discussion, does present some problems. Several mainstream faiths can be considered indigenous in much of their range e.g. [[Daoism]], [[Shinto]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], while [[Zoroastrianism]] now has very few followers and is essentially no longer 'mainstream'. More problematic is that this duality renders invisible the many merged or [[syncretic]] faiths and folk variants of mainstream religions where elements of the preceding indigenous beliefs are still practiced. These folk religions can have much stronger nature ethics than the more symbolic orthodox form.

Within human history, religion has been used (or abused) as a tool of domination. These issues, although much reduced, have not gone away and some faiths still seek converts from other faiths. The destruction of [[sacred site]]s has been part of that domination and still continues today. Conversely, most faiths over long periods of time have peaceably co-existed and shared sacred sites. Mutual respect and accommodation have often been reached. Further compassion and peace-building lie at the heart of many religious traditions and belief systems.

==The distribution of sacred natural sites==
Sacred natural sites are, with the exception of [[Antarctica]], found on every continent and probably in every country. Some of them are surely among the oldest venerated places of earth and at the same time new sacred natural sites are still being established, in some cases by migrants to new countries.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N., Higgins-Zogib L and Mansourian, S. (2005) ‘Beyond Belief, Linking faiths and protected areas to support biodiversity conservation’, WWF, Equilibrium and The Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC).&lt;/ref&gt; Paleo-anthropological evidence indicates that earlier humans such as [[Neanderthal]]s practised the cult of ancestors in burial sites over 60,000 years ago, which is arguably one of the origins of sacred sites. [[Ancestor worship]] and veneration of [[burial ground]]s seem to be a common trait of every culture of modern humans, as well as the adoration of natural features of great significance such as high mountains or large rivers. Australian sacred sites may go back at least 50,000 years; [[rock art]] considered of a sacred nature date to 20,000 years ago, and some of the [[Neolithic]] [[henge]]s date from 5,000 years ago.

At a landscape level, [[anthropologist]]s have long recognized the sacred status that cultures have given to nature not only in specific sacred sites,{{cn|date=February 2017}} but also in larger areas of cultural significance and entire landscapes. Interest on the importance of sacred sites for living cultures has seen an upsurge since the mid 1990s, which has contributed to the exploration of new paradigms and multidisciplinary views to the advantage of both the understanding and conservation of sacred sites.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes, F. (1999) ‘Sacred Ecology, Traditional ecological knowledge and resource management’, Taylor &amp; Francis, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, D.L., Hubert, J., Reeves, B. and Schanche, A. (1994) ‘Sacred Sites, Sacred Places’, Routledge, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Posey, D. (ed.) (1999) ‘Cultural and Spiritual Values of Biodiversity’, a comprehensive contribution to the UNEP Global Biodiversity Assessment. Intermediate Technology Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Because of their diversity, origins, and different and varying degrees of sacrality of their elements, it is not really possible to have full knowledge about the number of sacred sites existing in the world today. Exhaustively documenting sacred natural sites would have to be done by bottom-up identification at the community level, which is not really practicable. However, estimates have been made for some countries, notably India, where at least 13,720 [[sacred grove]]s have been reported and experts estimate that the total number for the country may be in the range of 100,000 to 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, K C., Ghokhale, Y., Chatterjee, S. and Srivastava, S. (2001) ‘Cultural and Ecological Dimensions of Sacred Groves in India’, INSA: New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; India may be exceptional because of its size, cultural diversity and widespread practices about sacred groves, but it would not be unrealistic to estimate that sacred natural sites must exist in the hundreds of thousands.

==Importance for the conservation of nature and culture==
Many sacred natural sites have been well protected over long time periods and have seen low levels of utilization.  Many are demonstrably high in [[biodiversity]] and represent a strong biodiversity conservation opportunity.{{cn|date=February 2017}} Sacred natural sites also represent ancient and profound [[cultural]] values. The roles of sacred sites’ custodians from indigenous, local community and mainstream religions are expressions of dedicated efforts that cultures that have specifically, if not always consciously, cared for nature in various ways.

While sacred natural sites are connected to the [[human spirit]] and intangible heritage they also have strong material components. In addition to being places where animals and plant species survive,  they provide resources such as water and medicines and other [[ecosystem service]]s, they are the location of events and ceremonies, and traditionally are sites of education. They link to livelihoods in many ways and the concepts of cultural services and human wellbeing are associated with them.{{cn|date=February 2017}} They support [[pilgrimage]]s and [[tourism]], both of which have large associated service sectors and generate significant economic activity.

==A brief history in conservation==
Following a seminal workshop organized by [[UNESCO]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Lee C, Schaaf T. (2003) ‘The Importance of Sacred Natural Sites for Biodiversity Conservation’, Proceedings of the International Workshop held in Kunming and Xishuangbanna Biosphere Reserve, People’s Republic of China, 17–20 February 2003. UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaaf T., and Lee, C. (2006) ‘Conserving Cultural and Biological Diversity: The Role of Sacred Natural Sites and Cultural Landscapes’ Proceedings of UNESCO-IUCN International Conference, Tokyo, Japan. UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; international conservation organisations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[IUCN]], working with indigenous groups and networks such as the [[Rigoberta Menchu Tum Foundation]], started to explore ways to integrate sacred natural sites in their conservation work. A number of international events and processes followed, and case studies and scientific and practitioner articles started to appear in books and journals. In 2003 IUCN’s Specialist Group on the Cultural and Spiritual Values of Protected Areas (CSVPA) and UNESCO started work on guidelines for the management of sacred natural sites.&lt;ref name=Wild&gt;Wild, R and McLeod, C (eds) (2008) 'Sacred Natural Sites: Guidelines for Protected Area Managers'. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN&lt;/ref&gt;  This Group has advanced a significant amount of work on sacred natural sites, including through specific projects such as the [[Delos Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallarach, J M. and Papayannis, T. (eds.) (2007) ‘Protected Areas and Spirituality’, IUCN and Publicacions de l’Abadia de Montserrat. Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Papayannis, T. and Mallarach, J M. (eds) (2009) ‘The Sacred Dimension of Protected Areas’, Proceedings of the Second Workshop of the Delos Initiative – Ouranoupolis 2007. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN and Athens, Greece: Med-INA.&lt;/ref&gt; Among international conservation NGO’s, The [[Nature Conservancy]] has developed a planning tool for the conservation of sacred sites and cultural heritage in protected areas and tested it across countries in [[Central America]] such as [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Secaira, E. and &amp; Molina M E, (2005) ‘Planning for the Conservation of Sacred Sites in the Context of Protected Areas’, an adaptation of a Methodology and lessons from its application in the Highlands of Western Guatemala. The nature conservancy, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; WWF studied sacred sites in one hundred protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N., Higgins-Zogib L and Mansourian, S. (2005) ‘Beyond Belief, Linking faiths and protected areas to support biodiversity conservation’, WWF, Equilibrium and The Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC).&lt;/ref&gt;

==International importance of sacred natural sites==
The urgent need for the protection of sacred natural sites has also been recognized by the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the [[UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]]. The CBD in 2004 developed the Akwe Kon voluntary guidelines for the conduct of cultural, environmental and social impact assessments regarding proposed developments that may affect sacred sites and on lands and waters traditionally occupied or used by indigenous and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2004, Akwé: Kon Voluntary Guidelines for the Conduct of Cultural, Environmental and Social Impact Assessment regarding Developments Proposed to Take Place on, or which are Likely to Impact on, Sacred Sites and on Lands and Waters Traditionally Occupied or Used by Indigenous and Local Communities’, CBD Guidelines Series, Montreal, 25p.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the political level, as described before, the adoption of the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] &lt;ref name=UNDRIP/&gt; is an important benchmark.  Article 12 in particular provides significant political leverage for developing appropriate policies for the protection and recognition of sacred natural sites at the national level. It states:  “Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practice, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites; the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains.”.&lt;ref name=UNDRIP&gt;UNDRIP (2007) ‘Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, United Nations’, General Assembly, 61st session, agenda item 68, Report of the Human Rights Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred natural sites and the ethics of research and inventory==
It is particularly important to raise the concept of free prior, [[informed consent]] (FPIC), which has emerged as a standard for engaging with [[indigenous people]] and local communities. This is particularly important with regard to sacred natural sites.  For many custodians of sacred natural sites [[secrecy]] is of the utmost importance and needs serious consideration and respect.&lt;ref name=Wild/&gt;  At the same time it needs to be recognised that research and inventory can be powerful tools for the communication and conservation of sacred natural sites.

==Sacred natural sites and global change==
Verschuuren et al. (2010) identified significant global changes, many of which affect sacred natural sites and their custodian communities.  These include:&lt;ref name=v/&gt;
*global human [[population increase]],
*modernity and erosion of traditional [[culture]],
*[[biodiversity loss]], [[Habitat destruction|habitat]] and species declines, [[species extinction]] and [[ecosystem]] damage,
*[[industrialization]] of [[agriculture]],  [[forestry]], [[Fishery|fisheries]] or other types of [[Land use|land]] and sea use,
*[[Mining|extractive]] and energy industries,
*growth of cities, [[urbanization]] and transport networks,
*increased conflict over [[natural resource]]s,
*weakened livelihood systems and [[poverty]],
*[[Social change|social]] and political changes and conflicts in the [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] realm,
*[[globalization]] of the dominant economic model based on continual growth, detached from ecological realities,
*decline in [[spirituality|spiritual]] values,
*[[climate change]].

Many of the drivers of these global changes are mutually reinforcing and affect cultural and [[biological diversity]] and the many services that sacred natural sites provide to human well-being. 

Generating a greater recognition of the sacred dimensions of nature focused on sacred natural sites is expected to be an important means of building public support for the policies that conserve biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the diversity of human adaptations to a changing environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1234">The '''Swedish–Russian Arc-of-Meridian expedition''' took place during five summer seasons and one winter season at [[Svalbard]], from 1899. The purpose of the mission was to measure the [[meridian arc]]s, in order to calculate whether earth flattening was larger at the [[Geographical pole|poles]].

The measurements were done by an establishing a chain of triangulation points from [[Keilhaufjellet]] in [[Sørkapp Land]] to [[Vesle Tavleøya]] north of [[Nordaustlandet]]. The Russians were responsible for the southern measurements, while the Swedes performed the northern measurements from a base at [[Crozierpynten]] in the fjord of [[Sorgfjorden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cruise-handbook.npolar.no/en/hornsund/arc-of-meridian.html |title=Cruise Handbook for Svalbard |chapter=The Arc of Meridian Expedition |first1=Jørn |last1=Henriksen |first2= Kristin |last2=Prestvold |publisher=Norwegian Polar Institute|year=2009 |accessdate=25 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Twinkling''', or '''scintillation''', is a generic term for variations in [[apparent brightness]] or [[apparent place|position]] of a distant luminous object viewed through a medium.&lt;ref name="intech"&gt;Wang,Ting-I; Williams, Donn; [http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=Article_Index1&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=44354 "Scintillation technology bests NIST"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215902/http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=Article_Index1&amp;template=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=44354 |date=2013-10-04 }}, ''InTech'', May 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; If the object lies outside the [[Earth's atmosphere]], as in the case of stars and [[planet]]s, the phenomenon is termed ''astronomical scintillation''; within the atmosphere, the phenomenon is termed ''terrestrial scintillation.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/hqlibrary/aerospacedictionary/508/508index.htm " NASA Aerospace Science and Technology Dictionary"], ''NASA.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the three principal factors governing [[astronomical seeing]], atmospheric twinkling is defined as variations in [[illuminance]] only.

In simple terms, twinkling of stars is caused by the passing of light through [[air mass (astronomy)|different layers]] of a turbulent atmosphere. Most scintillation effects are caused by anomalous [[refraction]] caused by small-scale fluctuations in [[air density]] usually related to temperature gradients.&lt;ref&gt;Sofieva, V. F.; Sofieva, A.S.; et al. [http://www.athena-spu.gr/ftp/lfsc/Literature/Sofieva_2007_GOMOS_GW-TurbulenceParamReconstruction.pdf "Reconstruction of internal gravity wave and turbulence parameters in the stratosphere using GOMOS scintillation measurements"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} ''Journal of Geophysical Research'' '''112'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VanCleave, Janice; [http://scienceprojectideasforkids.com/2010/stellar-scintillation-twinkling-stars/ "Stellar Scintillation: Twinkling Stars"] ''JVC's Science Fair Projects'', May 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Scintillation effects are always much more pronounced near the [[horizon]] than near the [[zenith]] (straight up),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/educ/activit/scint.htm "Scintillation or Atmospheric Boil"], ''noaa.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; since the light near the horizon passes through a thicker layer of atmosphere. Atmospheric twinkling is measured quantitatively using a [[scintillometer]].&lt;ref&gt;Chun, M.; Avila, R; [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2002ASPC..266...72C "Turbulence profiling using a scanning scintillometer"], ''Astronomical Site Evaluation in the Visible and Radio Range'', Astronomical Society of the Pacific '''266''':72-78&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of twinkling are reduced by using a larger receiver [[aperture]].  This effect is known as ''aperture averaging''.&lt;ref&gt;Perlot,.N.; Fritzsche, D. [http://elib.dlr.de/7341/1/LASE2004-5338-29_Perlot_ApAv_measur_HANDOUT.pdf "Aperture-Averaging - Theory and Measurements"], ''elib - Electronic Library''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=C. |last2=Phillips |first2=R.L |last3=Hopen |first3=C. |year=2000 |title=Aperture averaging of optical scintillations |journal=Waves in Random and Complex Media |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=53–70 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While light from stars and other [[astronomical object]]s are likely to twinkle,&lt;ref&gt;Wheelon, Albert D. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Electromagnetic_Scintillation_Volume_2_W.html?id=CNPtmZJZWCAC "Electromagnetic Scintillation: Volume 2, Weak Scattering"], ''Cambridge University Press,'' Jul 31, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; twinkling usually does not cause images of planets to flicker appreciably.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, S.L.; Lawrence, M. et al; [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~mcba/pubs/kenyon06.pdf "Atmospheric Scintillation at Dome C, Antarctica"], ''Astronomical Society of the Pacific'' '''118''' 924-932&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellison |first1=M.

Stars twinkle because they are so far from Earth that they appear as point sources of light easily disturbed by Earth's atmospheric [[turbulence]], which acts like lenses and prisms [[atmospheric refraction|diverting]] the light's path. Large astronomical objects closer to Earth, like the [[Moon]] and other planets, encompass many points in space and can be resolved as objects with observable diameters. With multiple observed points of light traversing the atmosphere, their light's deviations average out and the viewer perceives less variation in light coming from them.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, John A.

The '''USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies''' ('''WIES''') is an environmental research and education facility run by the [[University of Southern California]].  It is an organized research unit that encompasses a wide range of faculty and topics across the university as well as operating a marine laboratory at the edge of [[Two Harbors, California]] on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] approximately 22 miles (35 km) south-southwest of [[Los Angeles]].  

The USC Wrigley Institute has specialized programs in environmental microbiology, geobiology, ocean biogeochemistry, living marine resources (including fisheries and aquaculture), climate change, coastal environmental quality and the urban ocean.  The Institute is also home to the USC Sea Grant Program, part of the [[National Sea Grant Program]] through the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].

The mission of the Wrigley Institute is to encourage responsible and creative decisions in society by providing an objective source of [[environmental science]], and to foster an understanding of the natural world among people of all ages.  The faculty conduct academic research that is both good basic science and directly relevant to the needs of society.  The Institute operates a "K-gray" educational program with extensive outreach into the major student populations of greater Los Angeles.  It also creates real linkages between the academic scholarship and decision-making in society.

The Catalina Island facility centers around the Philip K. Wrigley Marine Science Center (WMSC).  This {{convert|14|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus on Catalina Island includes, a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} laboratory building, a dormitory and cottage-style housing, a cafeteria, a [[Hyperbaric oxygen therapy|hyperbaric chamber]], and a large waterfront staging area complete with dock, pier, helipad, moorings, boats and diving lockers.  The Institute lies adjacent to Big Fisherman's Cove, a no-take protected refuge.&lt;ref name="Protect our Oceans"&gt;[http://dornsife.usc.edu/enst-320a/water-and-soil/?p=342 Protect Our Oceans], Description of Big Fisherman's Cove MPA status.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to facilities for researchers and graduate students, the campus is home of USC's Catalina Semester, a 15-week intensive program in marine and environmental studies, as well as educational programs for pre-college students, families, executives and senior citizens.  It is one of a handful of marine laboratories in the United States that is specifically open to students and faculty from other institutions.

USC opened its first facility on the island in 1965 after a grant of more than {{convert|14|acre|m2}} of land to USC by the [[Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company|Wrigley]] family.  The Science Center is named after [[Philip K. Wrigley]], the son of the founder of the famous gum company.  The Wrigley Institute was founded in 1995 after a donation by [[William Wrigley III|William and Julie Wrigley]].

In the summer 2007, USC began work on installing six pre-built 48-ton, {{convert|1200|sqft|m2|-1|sing=on}} Tuscan-style houses to the island to house prominent scientists and corporate executives so they would not be placed in the standard dormitories.&lt;ref name=LAT080307&gt;Louis Sahagun, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-catalina3aug03,1,5242952.story Homes readied to set sail], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The homes would add over 20 rooms, and transportation to the remote campus involved both barges to transport them across the {{convert|22|mi|km|0|sing=on}} ocean channel and heavy cranes to pull the houses up the hill to their final location.&lt;ref name=LAT080307&gt;Louis Sahagun, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-catalina3aug03,1,5242952.story Homes readied to set sail], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  

USC provides regular semi-weekly boat transportation to the facility from the [[Southern California Marine Institute]] on [[Terminal Island]].&lt;ref name="Transportation Information"&gt;[http://dornsife.usc.edu/wrigley/transportation/ Transportation Information], WMSC Site.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UKEEP''' is a [[credit facility]] developed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ([[EBRD]]), targeting Ukrainian private companies in all sectors looking to invest in energy efficiency or [[renewable energy]] projects. The UKEEP credit line is provided through participating banks in [[Ukraine]], who in turn on-lend to Ukrainian private companies applying for UKEEP financing. Investments are anticipated to decrease energy consumption, increase own energy production or make energy usage more efficient.

UKEEP is active and is scheduled to run until the end of 2012. UKEEP has so far committed approximately US$102 million to energy efficiency projects in various sectors. Together, these projects will lead to energy savings of more than 2,115,000 MWh per year – equivalent to the household electricity consumption of more than 520,000 households. As a result, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Air pollution|emissions]] will decrease by more than 504,000 tonnes per year – equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 225,000 passenger cars.

At company level the UKEEP concept has turned out to be very profitable with individual Ukrainian companies saving up to 85% of their energy consumption by investing in new and more energy efficient technologies. The success of UKEEP has resulted in EBRD launching similar concepts in several other Eastern European countries.

The '''Volcanic Seven Summits''' are the highest [[volcano]]es on each of the seven [[continent]]s, just as the [[Seven Summits]] are the highest peaks on each of the seven continents. Summiting all seven is regarded as a [[mountaineering]] challenge, first postulated as such in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Volcanic "Seven Summits" | url= http://www.skimountaineer.com/ROF/VolcanicSeven.html | date= November 1999 | accessdate = 2007-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Volcanic Seven Summits are also in the [[Seven Summits]] list. [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and [[Mount Elbrus]], which were formed volcanically, are the highest peaks of their respective continents.

==Definitions==
Due to different interpretations of [[continent]]al borders (geological, geographical, geopolitical) several definitions for the highest summits per continent and the number of continents are possible. The number of seven continents used here is based on the [[Continent#Number of continents|continent model]] used in Western Europe and the United States.  The continents as defined here are on a geological and geographical basis, not geopolitical.

An additional complication in determining the highest volcanic summits is defining exactly what constitutes a volcano and how much [[topographic prominence]] it must have relative to any nearby non-volcanic peaks in order to qualify. For the purposes of this list, the summits must be an actual eruptive volcanic center, not merely made of volcanic rocks which were uplifted by other geological processes. In addition, a topographic prominence of at least {{Convert|1000|ft|m|-1}} is required,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} so that the list includes only genuine volcanic mountains and not minor outpourings of lava which happened to leak to the Earth's surface in high-altitude regions (see ''Asia'' below).

===Africa, North America, Antarctica===
No serious dispute exists as to the highest volcanoes in Africa, North America, and Antarctica-—respectively, [[Kilimanjaro]], [[Pico de Orizaba]], and [[Mount Sidley]].

===Australia===
Although there are a few minor and inactive [[List of volcanoes in Australia|volcanoes on the Australian mainland]], this list recognizes that the island of [[New Guinea]] is part of the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]].  Numerous scientific papers written in the 1970s and 1980s confirm that [[Mount Giluwe]] in [[Papua New Guinea]] is in fact an old eroded volcano,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blake | first1 = D. H. | first2 = E. | last2 = Löffler | title = Volcanic and Glacial Landforms on Mount Giluwe, Territory of Papua and New Guinea | journal = Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume = 82 | issue = 6 | pages = 1605–1614 | publisher =  | url = http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1130%2F0016-7606(1971)82%5B1605%3AVAGLOM%5D2.0.CO%3B2 | year = 1971 | doi = 10.1130/0016-7606(1971)82[1605:VAGLOM]2.0.CO;2 | bibcode = 1971GSAB...82.1605B | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120217041344/http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1130%2F0016-7606(1971)82%5B1605:VAGLOM%5D2.0.CO%3B2 | archivedate = 2012-02-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Löffler | first1 = E. | first2 = D.

unlike the higher mountains of New Guinea which are all non-volcanic in origin.

Even if this continent is defined instead as [[Oceania]] (thus adding [[New Zealand]] and [[Polynesia]] including [[Hawaii]]), Giluwe remains the highest volcano since it exceeds the elevation of [[Mauna Kea]] in Hawaii and any volcano in New Zealand.

===Europe===
The generally accepted geographical border between Europe and Asia runs along the crest of the [[Ural Mountains]] in central [[Russia]] and of the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] along the southern border of Russia.  Since the massive twin-peaked [[stratovolcano]] of [[Mount Elbrus]] rises just north of the crest, it is the highest summit in [[Europe]] and also the highest volcano.

Some geologists, though, consider the [[Kuma–Manych Depression|Kuma-Manych depression]] as the geological border between Asia and Europe. Such definition would render Elbrus entirely in Asia, making it the highest volcano of that continent (see below) and making [[Mount Etna]] (a 3350-metre active stratovolcano in [[Sicily]], [[Italy]]) the highest volcano in Europe. Mount [[Teide]] in the [[Canary Islands]], while active, taller than Etna and within the territory of a European country, would not be considered because geologically the Canaries belong to the African continent.

===South America===
Although [[Aconcagua]], the highest peak in [[South America]] and the highest peak in the western hemisphere, does have a volcanic origin, its current high point is due to geological processes rather than being strictly volcanic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/24836826/Geology-of-Aconcagua|title=Geology of Aconcagua {{!}} Volcano {{!}} Plate Tectonics|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to this, Aconcagua is not considered to be a volcano on its own, at least not as a member of Volcanic Seven Summits.

Topographic maps of the [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] border region which contains the highest peaks suffer from poor accuracy, with elevation errors exceeding {{Convert|100|m|ft|-1}} in many cases.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} However, the current consensus based on the most recent measurements places [[Ojos del Salado]] as the 2nd highest peak and highest volcano in South America, significantly higher than [[Monte Pissis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Biggar | first = John | title = The Andes: A Guide for Climbers (3rd Ed.) | publisher = Andes | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-9536087-2-7 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The {{Convert|5610|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Mount Damavand]] is a very large isolated stratovolcano with over {{Convert|4600|m|ft|-3|abbr=on}} of topographic prominence.

There are more than 70 volcanic vents known as the [[Kunlun Volcanic Group]] in [[Tibet]] at higher elevations than Damavand's summit, the highest of which has a reported elevation of {{Convert|5808|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} ({{Coord|35.5|N|80.2|E|type:mountain}}). Peaks in this volcanic group are not considered volcanic mountains but instead a type of [[Volcanic cone|pyroclastic cone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Kunlun Volcanic Group | work = Global Volcanism Program | publisher = [[Smithsonian Institution]] | url= http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1004-03- | accessdate = 2007-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information about these cones is extremely scarce and the listed elevations and [[topographic prominence|prominences]] is of unknown accuracy and reliability. It is disputed whether any of these cones have a prominence greater than {{Convert|300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}.{{cn|date=September 2017}} The volcanoes in the list below all have prominences far exceeding that threshold.

==Volcanic Seven Second Summits==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
{{see also|Seven Second Summits}}
Defining the second highest volcanoes on each continent is a bit more complicated, because the continental definitions become critical.

The problem between Australia and Oceania: [[Mount Hagen (volcano)|Mount Hagen]] in [[Papua New Guinea]] is certainly the second highest volcano on the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]], but expanding the continental definition to span also the [[Oceania#Physiography|broad definition]] of [[Oceania]] drops Hagen to 4th behind [[Mauna Kea]] and [[Mauna Loa]] on the [[Island of Hawaii]].

In Europe, [[Kazbek]] is the second highest volcano. It lies on the border of [[Russia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], whose European status is sometimes disputed, although Kazbek lies entirely on the European side of the Caucasus watershed. The river [[Terek River|Terek]] rises to the south and west of Kazbek but drains northwards to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skimountaineer.com/ROF/ROF.php?name=Kazbek DMA Map NK 38-5 Gora Kazbek]&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

In 2011, Mario Trimeri became the first person to complete both the Volcanic Seven Summits and [[Seven Summits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mario Trimeri |url=http://www.sevensummits-volcanicsevensummits.it/biografia/ |website=Seven Summits |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The youngest person to complete the Volcanic Seven Summits and Seven Summits was [[Daniel Bull]] from Australia.

A '''weather front''' is a boundary separating two [[air mass|masses of air]] of different [[air density|densities]], and is the principal cause of [[meteorological phenomenon|meteorological phenomena]] [[Tropical weather|outside the tropics]]. In [[surface weather analysis|surface weather analyses]], fronts are depicted using various colored triangles and half-circles, depending on the type of front.  The air masses separated by a front usually differ in [[temperature]] and [[humidity]].

[[Cold front]]s may feature narrow bands of [[thunderstorm]]s and [[severe weather]], and may on occasion be preceded by [[squall line]]s or [[dry line]]s. [[Warm front]]s are usually preceded by [[Stratus cloud|stratiform]] [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[fog]]. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, although there is invariably a [[Wind direction|wind shift]].&lt;ref name="stm"&gt;{{cite web|author=Samuel Miller |title=Lesson 7: Clouds and Precipitation |year= |accessdate=2011-07-08 |url=http://www.ccrc.sr.unh.edu/~stm/AS/Teaching/STEC521/STEC521_7.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111070558/http://www.ccrc.sr.unh.edu/~stm/AS/Teaching/STEC521/STEC521_7.html |archivedate=2005-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cold fronts and [[occluded front]]s generally move from west to east, while warm fronts move [[Geographical pole|poleward]]. Because of the greater density of air in their [[wake]], cold fronts and cold occlusions move faster than warm fronts and warm occlusions. Mountains and warm bodies of water can slow the movement of fronts.&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Roth|title=Unified Surface Analysis Manual|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|url= http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a front becomes [[stationary front|stationary]]—and the [[density contrast]] across the frontal boundary vanishes—the front can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing [[wind velocity]], known as a [[Shear line (meteorology)|shearline]]. This is most common over the open ocean.

==Bergeron classification of air masses==
{{Main article|Air mass}}
The [[Tor Bergeron|Bergeron]] classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification. Air mass classifications are indicated by three letters.  The first letter describes its [[moisture]] properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist).  The second letter describes the [[thermal]] characteristic of its source region:  T for [[Tropics|tropical]], P for [[Polar regions of Earth|polar]], A for [[arctic]] or [[Antarctic]], M for [[monsoon]], E for [[Equatorial region|equatorial]], and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant upward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter designates the stability of the atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=airmass-classification1 Airmass Classification.] Retrieved on 2008-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Fronts separate air masses of different types or origins, and are located along [[trough (meteorology)|troughs]] of lower [[Atmospheric pressure|pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SpGfKb23Y9QC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;dq=weather+fronts+separate+different+air+masses+book#v=onepage&amp;q=weather%20fronts%20separate%20different%20air%20masses%20book&amp;f=false|title=Meteorology today: an introduction to weather, climate, and the environment|page=296|author=C.

{{Main article|Surface weather analysis|Low-pressure area|High-pressure area}}
A surface weather analysis is a special type of [[weather map]] which provides a view of weather elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations.&lt;ref name="disc1"&gt;Monmonier, Mark. ''Air Apparent: How Meteorologists Learned to Map, Predict, and Dramatize Weather.''  University of Chicago Press. Chicago: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as [[Atmospheric pressure|sea-level pressure]], [[temperature]], and [[cloud cover]] onto a [[Cartography|geographical map]] to help find [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]] features such as weather fronts.  Surface weather analyses have special symbols which show frontal systems, cloud cover, [[precipitation]], or other important information.  For example, an ''H'' may represent high pressure, implying fair weather.  An ''L'' on the other hand may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Low pressure also creates surface winds deriving from high pressure zones.  Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map.  In addition, areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.&lt;ref name="disc1"/&gt;

==&lt;span id='Front Types'&gt;Types&lt;/span&gt;==
There are two different meanings used within meteorology to describe weather around a frontal zone.  The term "[[wikt:anafront|anafront]]" describes boundaries which show instability, meaning air rises rapidly along and over the boundary to cause significant weather changes.  A "[[wikt:katafront|katafront]]" is weaker, bringing smaller changes in temperature and moisture, as well as limited rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ew3MBjbw4OAC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;dq=anafront+book#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The environment: principles and applications|author=Chris C. Park|page=309|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2001|accessdate=2010-12-17|isbn=978-0-415-21771-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold front===
{{Main article|Cold front}}

A cold front is located at the leading edge of the temperature drop off, which in an [[Isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] analysis shows up as the leading edge of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. Cold fronts often bring heavy [[Thunderstorm|thunderstorms]], rain, and [[hail]].  Cold fronts can produce sharper changes in weather and move up to twice as quickly as warm fronts, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly replaces the warm air preceding the boundary. On weather maps, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangle-shaped pips pointing in the direction of travel, and it is placed at the leading edge of the cooler air mass.&lt;ref name="DR"/&gt; Cold fronts come in association with a [[low-pressure area]]. The concept of colder, dense air "wedging" under the less dense warmer air is often used to depict how air is lifted along a frontal boundary. The cold air wedging underneath warmer air creates the strongest winds just above the ground surface, a phenomenon often associated with property-damaging wind gusts.  This lift would then form a narrow line of [[Precipitation|showers]] and [[thunderstorm]]s if enough [[moisture]] were present. However, this concept isn't an accurate description of the physical processes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NWS Glossary|title=Overrunning|year=|accessdate=2010-05-02|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=o|publisher=National Weather Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; upward motion is not produced because of warm air "ramping up" cold, dense air, rather, [[Frontogenesis|frontogenetical]] circulation is behind the upward forcing.

===Warm front===
{{Main article|Warm front}}
Warm fronts are at the leading edge of a homogeneous warm air mass, which is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="DR"/&gt;

This also forces temperature differences across warm fronts to be broader in scale.  Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly [[Stratus cloud|stratiform]], and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches.  [[Fog]] can also occur preceding a warm frontal passage.  Clearing and warming is usually rapid after frontal passage.  If the warm air mass is unstable, thunderstorms may be embedded among the stratiform clouds ahead of the front, and after frontal passage thundershowers may continue. On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of semicircles pointing in the direction of travel.&lt;ref name="DR" /&gt;

===Occluded front===

An [[occluded front]] is formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=University of Illinois Department of Atmospheric Sciences|title=Occluded Front|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gl)/guides/mtr/af/frnts/ofdef.rxml}}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually forms around mature low-pressure areas.&lt;ref name="DR"/&gt; The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Weather Service Office, Norman, Oklahoma|title=Triple Point|year=|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/severewx/glossary4.php#t}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front and plows under both air masses.  In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is warmer than the cold air ahead of the warm front and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air.&lt;ref name="DR" /&gt;

A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the ''[[wikt:trowal|trowal]]'', the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/rapid_cyclo/www/english/glossary/trowalca.htm | title = Trowal | work = [[World Meteorological Organisation]] | publisher = Eumetcal | accessdate = 2013-08-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140331011643/http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/rapid_cyclo/www/english/glossary/trowalca.htm | archivedate = 2014-03-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel.&lt;ref name="DR"/&gt;  The trowal is indicated by a series of blue and red junction lines.

===Stationary front===
{{Main article|Stationary front}}
A [[stationary front]] is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, neither of which is strong enough to replace the other. They tend to remain essentially in the same area for extended periods of time, usually moving in waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gl)/guides/mtr/af/frnts/sfdef.rxml Stationary Front.] University of Illinois Department of Atmospheric Sciences. Retrieved on 2006-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; There is normally a broad [[temperature gradient]] behind the boundary with more widely spaced [[Contour line#Temperature and related subjects|isotherm]] packing.

A wide variety of weather can be found along a stationary front, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there.  Stationary fronts either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but they can transform into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change.  Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.

When stationary fronts become smaller in scale, degenerating to a narrow zone where wind direction changes significantly over a relatively short distance, they become known as shearlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Shear Line|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=shear+line|publisher=American Meteorological Society|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314081220/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=shear+line|archivedate=2007-03-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shearline is depicted as a line of red dots and dashes.&lt;ref name="DR"/&gt; Stationary fronts may bring snow or rain for a long period of time.

===Dry line===
{{Main article|Dry line}}
A similar phenomenon to a weather front is the [[dry line]], which is the boundary between air masses with significant moisture differences.  When the [[westerlies]] increase on the north side of surface highs, areas of lowered [[Barometric pressure|pressure]] will form downwind of north–south oriented mountain chains, leading to the formation of a lee trough.  Near the surface during daylight hours, warm moist air is denser than dry air of greater temperature, and thus the warm moist air wedges under the drier air like a cold front.  At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the dry air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, [[severe weather]] is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Huaqing Cai |title=Dryline cross section |year= |accessdate=2006-12-05 |url=http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~caihq/pic/fig23.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120180130/http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~caihq/pic/fig23.html |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A weaker form of the dry line seen more commonly is the lee trough, which displays weaker differences in [[moisture]].  When moisture pools along the boundary during the warm season, it can be the focus of diurnal [[thunderstorm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Lee Trough|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=lee-trough1|publisher=American Meteorological Society|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67iK9fLSr?url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=lee-trough1|archivedate=2012-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dry line may occur anywhere on earth in regions intermediate between [[desert]] areas and warm seas.  The southern plains west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the [[United States]] are a particularly favored location.  The dry line normally moves eastward during the day and westward at night.  A dry line is depicted on [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) surface analyses as an orange line with scallops facing into the moist sector. Dry lines are one of the few surface fronts where the pips indicated do not necessarily reflect the direction of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=University of Illinois Department of Atmospheric Science|title=Dry Line:  A Moisture Boundary|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gl)/guides/mtr/af/frnts/dfdef.rxml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Squall line===
{{Main article|Squall line}}
[[File:DangerousShelfCloud.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A shelf cloud such as this one can be a sign that a squall is imminent]]
Organized areas of thunderstorm activity not only reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, but can outrun cold fronts in a pattern where the upper level jet splits apart into two streams, with the resultant [[Mesoscale convective system|Mesoscale Convective System]] (MCS) forming at the point of the upper level split in the wind pattern running southeast into the warm sector parallel to low-level thickness lines. When the convection is strong and linear or curved, the MCS is called a squall line, with the feature placed at the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology |title=Chapter 2:  Definitions |year= |accessdate=2006-10-22 |url=http://www.ofcm.gov/slso/pdf/slsochp2.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506002006/http://www.ofcm.gov/slso/pdf/slsochp2.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even weaker and less organized areas of thunderstorms lead to locally cooler air and higher pressures, and outflow boundaries exist ahead of this type of activity, which can act as foci for additional thunderstorm activity later in the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Branick|title=A Comprehensive Glossary of Weather|year=|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://www.geographic.org/climate/o.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These features are often depicted in the warm season across the United States on surface analyses and lie within surface troughs. If outflow boundaries or squall lines form over arid regions, a [[haboob]] may result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Western Region Climate Center|title=H|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/ams/glossary.html#H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Squall lines are depicted on NWS surface analyses as an alternating pattern of two red dots and a dash labelled SQLN or SQUALL LINE, while outflow boundaries are depicted as troughs with a label of OUTFLOW BOUNDARY.

==Precipitation produced==
{{main article|Precipitation}}
[[File:Konvektionsregen.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Convective precipitation]]
Fronts are the principal cause of significant weather. ''[[Atmospheric convection|Convective precipitation]]'' (showers, thundershowers, and related unstable weather) is caused by air being lifted and condensing into clouds by the movement of the cold front or cold occlusion under a mass of warmer, moist air.  If the temperature differences of the two air masses involved are large and the turbulence is extreme because of [[wind shear]] and the presence of a strong [[jet stream]], "[[roll cloud]]s" and [[tornado]]es may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Convection|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=convection|publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the warm [[season]], lee troughs, breezes, outflow boundaries and occlusions can lead to convection if enough moisture is available. ''[[Orographic lift|Orographic precipitation]]'' is precipitation created through the lifting action of air moving over terrain such as mountains and hills, which is most common behind cold fronts that move into mountainous areas. It may sometimes occur in advance of warm fronts moving northward to the east of mountainous terrain. However, precipitation along warm fronts is relatively steady, as in rain or drizzle. Fog, sometimes extensive and dense, often occurs in pre-warm-frontal areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Orographic Lifting|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=orographic-lifting1|publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although, not all fronts produce precipitation or even clouds because moisture must be present in the air mass which is being lifted.&lt;ref name="stm" /&gt;

==Movement==
Fronts are generally guided by [[winds aloft]], but do not move as quickly.  Cold fronts and occluded fronts in the Northern Hemisphere usually travel from the northwest to southeast, while warm fronts move more poleward with time. In the Northern Hemisphere a warm front moves from southwest to northeast. In the Southern Hemisphere, the reverse is true; a cold front usually moves from southwest to northeast, and a warm front moves from northwest to southeast. Movement is largely caused by the pressure gradient force (horizontal differences in atmospheric pressure) and the [[Coriolis effect]], which is caused by [[Earth]]'s spinning about its axis. Frontal zones can be slowed down by geographic features like mountains and large bodies of warm water.&lt;ref name="DR"/&gt;
