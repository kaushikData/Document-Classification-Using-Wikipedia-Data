The '''United States presidential election of 1984''' was the 50th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. It was held on Tuesday, November 6, 1984. Incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] defeated former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Walter Mondale]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate.

Reagan faced only token opposition in his bid for re-nomination by the Republicans, and he and Vice President [[George H.W. Bush]] were easily re-nominated. Mondale defeated Senator [[Gary Hart]] and several other candidates in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1984|1984 Democratic primaries]]. Mondale chose Congresswoman [[Geraldine Ferraro]] of New York as his running mate, making Ferraro the first woman to serve on either major party's national ticket.

Reagan touted a strong economic recovery from the 1970s [[stagflation]] and the [[Early 1980s recession|1981–82 recession]], as well as the widespread perception that his presidency had overseen a revival of national confidence and prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/07/politics/07REAG.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Reagan Wins By a Landslide, Sweeping at Least 48 States; G.O.P. Gains Strength in House |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 7, 1984 |accessdate=March 21, 2013 |author=Raines, Howell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reagan campaign produced effective television advertising and deftly neutralized concerns regarding Reagan's age. Mondale criticized Reagan's [[supply-side economics|supply-side economic policies]] and budget deficits, and he called for a [[Nuclear disarmament|nuclear freeze]] and ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].

Reagan won 58.8% of the popular vote and carried 49 of the 50 states, becoming the oldest person to win a presidential election at the time. Reagan's showing ranks [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|fifth]] in the share of electoral votes received and [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|fifth]] in the share of the popular vote won.  No candidate since 1984 has equaled Reagan's share of the electoral or popular vote. Mondale received 40.6% of the popular vote, but carried only the [[District of Columbia]] and his home state of [[Minnesota]]. Reagan also won the highest number of electoral votes of any president thus far.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thoughtco.com/landslide-presidential-elections-by-electoral-votes-3367489&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Reagan]]—the incumbent [[President of the United States|president]]—was the assured nominee for the Republican Party, with only token opposition. The popular vote from the Republican primaries was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55209 |title=Ourcampaigns.com |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ronald Reagan (inc.): 6,484,987 (98.78%)
* Unpledged delegates: 55,458 (0.85%)
* Harold Stassen: 12,749 (0.19%)
* Benjamin Fernandez: 202 (0.00%)

Reagan was renominated by a vote of 2,233 delegates (two delegates abstained). For the only time in American history, the vice presidential roll call was taken concurrently with the presidential roll call. Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] was overwhelmingly renominated. This was the last time in the 20th century that the vice presidential candidate of either major party was nominated by roll call vote.

=== Primaries ===
[[File:Walter Mondale accepting state primary victory in Des Moines, Iowa..jpg|thumb|right|Mondale celebrates his victory in the [[Iowa caucuses|Iowa caucus]].]]
Only three Democratic candidates won any state primaries: Mondale, Hart, and Jackson. Initially, Massachusetts Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], after a failed bid to win the 1980 Democratic nomination for president, was considered the ''de facto'' front-runner of the 1984 primary.  But, after Kennedy ultimately declined to run, former Vice-President Mondale was then viewed as the favorite to win the Democratic nomination.  Mondale had the largest number of party leaders supporting him, and he had raised more money than any other candidate. However, both Jackson and Hart emerged as surprising, and troublesome, opponents.

South Carolina Senator [[Ernest Hollings]]'s wit and experience, as well as his call for a [[budget freeze]], won him some positive attention, but his relatively conservative record alienated liberal Democrats, and he was never really noticed in a field dominated by [[Walter Mondale]], [[John Glenn]], and [[Gary Hart]].  Hollings dropped out two days after losing badly in New Hampshire, and endorsed Hart a week later.  His disdain for his competitors was at times showcased in his comments. He notably referred to Mondale as a "lapdog," and to former astronaut Glenn as "[[Sky King]]" who was "confused in his capsule."&lt;ref&gt;Skipper, John C. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3z7bGzNHIO0C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=hollings+glenn+%22sky+king%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IutNbIr2Zg&amp;sig=SvY8lM3CSDm9qCr9Y6ucA4arl9c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x5I4TbmBCsGugQf0l4DzCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hollings%20glenn%20%22sky%20king%22&amp;f=false The Iowa Caucuses: First Tests of Presidential Aspiration, 1972–2008], pg. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

California Senator [[Alan Cranston]] hoped to galvanize supporters of the nuclear freeze movement that had called on the United States to halt the deployment of existing nuclear weapons and the development of new ones.
Glenn and Askew hoped to capture the support of moderate and conservative Democrats. None of them possessed the fundraising ability of Mondale nor the grassroots support of Hart and Jackson, and none won any contests.

Jackson was the second [[African-American]] (after [[Shirley Chisholm]]) to mount a nationwide campaign for the presidency, and he was the first African-American candidate to be a serious contender.  He got 3.5 million votes during the primaries, third behind Hart and Mondale.  He won the primaries in Virginia, South Carolina, and Louisiana, and split Mississippi, where there were two separate contests for Democratic delegates.  Through the primaries, Jackson helped confirm the black electorate's importance to the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in the South at the time.  During the campaign, however, Jackson made an off-the-cuff reference to [[Jew]]s as "Hymies" and [[New York City]] as "Hymietown," for which he later apologized.  Nonetheless, the remark was widely publicized, and derailed his campaign for the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/jackson.htm|title=Jesse Jackson's 'Hymietown' Remark – 1984|publisher=Washington Post|author=Larry J. Sabato's Feeding Frenzy | date=July 21, 1998 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jackson ended up winning 21% of the national primary vote but received only 8% of the delegates to the national convention, and he initially charged that his campaign was hurt by the same party rules that allowed Mondale to win.  He also poured scorn on Mondale, saying that [[Hubert Humphrey]] was the "last significant politician out of the St. Paul-Minneapolis" area.&lt;ref name="ThomasTime1984"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Thomas |first=Evan |last2=Allis |first2=Sam |last3=Beckwith |first3=David |date=July 2, 1984 |title=Trying to Win the Peace |newspaper=Time Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart, from Colorado, was a more serious threat to Mondale, and after winning several early primaries it looked as if he might take the nomination away from Mondale. Hart finished a surprising second in the [[Iowa caucuses]], with 16.5% of the vote. This established him as the main rival to Mondale, effectively eliminating John Glenn, Ernest Hollings and Alan Cranston as alternatives.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Hart criticized Mondale as an "old-fashioned" [[New Deal]] Democrat who symbolized "failed policies" of the past.  Hart positioned himself (just as [[Bill Clinton]] would eight years later) as a younger, fresher, and more moderate Democrat who could appeal to younger voters.  He emerged as a formidable candidate, winning the key New Hampshire, Ohio, and California primaries as well as several others, especially in the West.  However, Hart could not overcome Mondale's financial and organizational advantages, especially among labor union leaders in the Midwest and industrial Northeast.

Hart was also badly hurt in a televised debate with Mondale during the primaries, when the former vice president used a popular television commercial slogan to ridicule Hart's vague "New Ideas" platform. Turning to Hart on camera, Mondale told Hart that whenever he heard Hart talk about his "New Ideas," he was reminded of the [[Wendy's]] fast-food slogan "[[Where's the beef?]]"  The remark drew loud laughter and applause from the viewing audience and caught Hart off-guard.  Hart never fully recovered from Mondale's charge that his "New Ideas" were shallow and lacking in specifics.

[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|left|Mondale celebrates several victories in March 13 primaries with former running mate [[Jimmy Carter]] at his campaign headquarters.]]
At a roundtable debate between the three remaining Democratic candidates moderated by [[Phil Donahue]], Mondale and Hart got into such a heated argument over the issue of U.S. policy in Central America that Jackson had to tap his water glass on the table to help get them to stop.

Mondale gradually pulled away from Hart in the delegate count, but, as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported in late May, "Mondale ... has a wide lead in total delegates (1,564 to 941) ... because of his victories in the big industrial states, his support from the Democratic Establishment and the arcane provisions of delegate-selection rules that his vanguard helped draft two years ago."&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Andersen, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951089,00.html? "A Wild Ride to the End"], ''Time'', May 28, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  After the final primary in California, on June 5, which Hart won, Mondale was about 40 delegates short of the total he needed for the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Marcus, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/15/AR2008011502863.html "Parsing Tsunami Tuesday"], ''Washington Post'', January 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the [[1984 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in [[San Francisco]] on July 16, Mondale received the overwhelming support of the unelected [[superdelegate]]s from the party establishment to win the nomination.

Mondale's nomination marked the second time since the nomination of former [[Governor of Georgia]] [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]] and the fourth time since the nomination of former Representative [[John W. Davis]] in [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]] that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominated a private citizen for [[President of the United States|President]] (i.e., not serving in an official government role at the time of the nomination and election). Mondale was the last private citizen to be nominated for President by the Democratic Party until former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] in [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]].

This race for the Democratic Party presidential nomination was the closest in two generations, and, as of 2017, it was the last occasion that a major party's race for the presidential nomination went all the way to its convention.

=== Convention ===
This was the [[1984 Democratic National Convention|convention's]] nomination tally:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|+ Balloting

!Presidential ballot!! !!Vice Presidential ballot!!
|-
![[Walter F. Mondale]] !!2,191!! [[Geraldine Ferraro|Geraldine A. Ferraro]] !!3,920

When he made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, Mondale said: "Let's tell the truth. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20617F63A5D0C738EDDAE0894DC484D81 |work=[[New York Times]] |title=Party Nominates Rep. Ferraro; Mondale, in Acceptance, Vows Fair Policies and Deficit Cut |date=July 20, 1984 |author=Howell Raines |page=A1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Mondale intended to expose Reagan as hypocritical and position himself as the honest candidate, the choice of raising taxes as a discussion point likely damaged his electoral chances.

=== Vice presidential nominee ===
[[File:Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, Vice-Presidential Candidate Geraldine Ferraro, Governor Michael Dukakis (9577542068).jpg|thumb|right|Ferraro with Boston Mayor [[Raymond Flynn]] and Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] at a campaign stop in Boston]]

Mondale chose [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Rep.]] [[Geraldine Ferraro|Geraldine A. Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party, and the first [[Italian American]] on a major party ticket since [[Al Smith]] in [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]]. Mondale wanted to establish a precedent with his vice presidential candidate, although [[Tonie Nathan]] of the [[Libertarian Party (US)|Libertarian Party]] was already the first woman to receive an electoral vote in the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 election]]. Another reason for the nominee to "go for broke" instead of [[balancing the ticket]] was Reagan's lead in the polls.  Mondale hoped to appeal to women, and by 1980, they were the majority of voters. In a "much criticized parade of possible Veep candidates" to his home in Minnesota, Mondale considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] and [[Governor of Kentucky|Kentucky Governor]] [[Martha Layne Collins]], also female; Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and San Antonio Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], an Hispanic, as other finalists for the nomination.  In addition to her sex, Mondale chose Ferraro because he hoped she would attract ethnic voters with her personal background.&lt;ref name="ThomasTime1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time19840723"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,952425,00.html | title=Geraldine Ferraro: A Break with Tradition | accessdate=March 26, 2011 | author=Church, George L.; Magnuson, Ed | date=July 23, 1984 | publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsuccessful nomination candidate Jesse Jackson derided Mondale's vice-presidential screening process as a "P.R. parade of personalities," but praised Mondale for his choice, having himself pledged to name a woman to the ticket in the event he was nominated.

Mondale had wanted to choose [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Mario Cuomo]] as his running mate, but Cuomo declined and recommended Ferraro,&lt;ref name="blumenthal20080904"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/04/when-the-press-vetted-geraldine-ferraro/ |title=When the Press Vetted Geraldine Ferraro |accessdate=March 26, 2011 |author=Blumenthal, Ralph |date=September 8, 2008 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; his protégée.&lt;ref name="buckley20110328"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/nyregion/28geraldine.html |title=Of Ferraro's Roles in Many Arenas, a Favorite: Gerry From Queens |accessdate=March 30, 2011 |author=Buckley, Cara |date=March 28, 2011 |work=The New York Times |pages=A18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondale may have named [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]] as his running mate had he wanted to make a "safe" choice",{{r|time19840723}} while others preferred Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] because he would appeal to more conservative Southern voters. Nomination rival [[Gary Hart]] stated before Ferraro's selection that he would accept an invitation to run with Mondale;{{r|time19840723}} Hart's supporters claimed he would do better than Mondale against President Reagan, an argument undercut by a June 1984 Gallup poll that showed both men nine points behind the president.

&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="160"&gt;
File:JohnAnderson.png|&lt;center&gt;Former Representative&lt;br /&gt; '''[[John B. Anderson]]'''&lt;br /&gt; from [[Illinois]]&lt;br /&gt;''&lt;small&gt;(declined to run – April 26, 1984)&lt;br /&gt;(endorsed Mondale – August 27)&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The '''National Unity Party''' was an outgrowth of [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson's]] presidential campaign from the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]]. Anderson hoped that the party would be able to challenge the "two old parties", which he viewed as being tied to various special interest groups and incapable of responsible fiscal reform. The intention was to organize the new party in California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, the New England states, and others where his previous candidacy had proven to have experienced the most success. The party was also eligible for $5.8 million in Federal election funds, but its qualification depended on it being on the ballot in at least ten states; however, it remained unclear if National Unity could actually obtain the funds, or if it needed to be Anderson himself.

Anderson initially was against running, hoping that another notable politico would take the party into the 1984 election, and feared that his own candidacy might result in the party being labeled a "personality cult". However, no candidate came forward resulting in Anderson becoming the nominee in waiting. While Anderson had found equal support from the Republicans and Democrats in the 1980 election, the grand majority of the former had since switched back, resulting in the new party being supported principally by those who normally would vote Democratic, which it was feared might make him a [[Spoiler effect|spoiler candidate]]. In light of this, in addition to difficulties in getting on the ballot in his targeted states ''(Utah and Kentucky were the only two, neither among those he intended to prominently campaign in)'', Anderson ultimately declined to run. Later he would endorse the Democratic nominee, [[Walter Mondale]].

Anderson had hoped that the party would continue to grow and later field a candidate in 1988 ''(which he declared would not be him)'', but it floundered and ultimately dissolved.

=== Libertarian Party nomination ===
* [[David Bergland]], Party Chairman from [[California]]
* [[Gene Burns]], [[talk radio]] host from [[Florida]] ''(withdrew – August 26, 1983)''&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dU4tAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VM8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3911,4640110&amp;dq=gene-burns+radio&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tonie Nathan]], 1972 vice presidential nominee from [[Oregon]] ''(declined to contest)''
* [[Earl Ravenal]], foreign policy analyst, academic, and writer from [[Washington, D.C.]]
* [[Mary Ruwart]], research scientist from [[Texas]]

Burns was the initial frontrunner for the nomination, but withdrew, citing concerns that the party would not be able to properly finance a campaign. The remaining candidates were Bergland; Ravenal, who had worked in the Department of Defense under [[Robert McNamara]] and [[Clark Clifford]]; and Ruwart. Bergland narrowly won the presidential nomination over Ravenal. His running mate was [[James A. Lewis]]. The ticket appeared on 39 state ballots.

=== Citizens Party nomination ===
[[Sonia Johnson]] ran in the 1984 presidential election, as the presidential candidate of the [[Citizens Party (United States)|Citizens Party]], Pennsylvania's Consumer Party and California's [[Peace and Freedom Party]]. Johnson received 72,161 votes (0.1%) finishing fifth. Her running mate for the Citizens Party was [[Richard Walton]] and for the Peace and Freedom Party [[Emma Wong Mar]]. One of her campaign managers, Mark Dunlea, later wrote a novel about a first female president, ''Madame President''.

=== Communist Party nomination ===
The [[Communist Party USA]] ran [[Gus Hall]] for president and [[Angela Davis]] for vice president.

Mondale ran a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] campaign, supporting a [[nuclear freeze]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). He spoke against what he considered to be unfairness in Reagan's economic policies and the need to reduce federal [[budget deficit]]s.

While Ferraro's choice was popular among Democratic activists, polls immediately after the announcement showed that only 22% of women were pleased about her selection, versus 18% who agreed that it was a bad idea. 60% of all voters thought that pressure from women's groups had led to Mondale's decision, versus 22% who believed that he had chosen the best available candidate.{{r|time19840723}} Some members of the hierarchy of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] criticized the Catholic Ferraro for being [[pro-choice]] on abortion. Already fighting an uphill battle with voters, Ferraro also faced a slew of allegations, mid-campaign, directed toward her husband, [[John Zaccaro]]. These allegations included Zaccaro's possible past involvement in organized crime, pornography distribution, and campaign contribution violations. Ferraro responded to these allegations against her husband by releasing her family tax returns to the media on August 21, 1984. However, the damage to the campaign was already done.{{r|martin20110327}}

At a campaign stop in [[Hammonton, New Jersey]], Reagan said, "America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in songs of a man so many young Americans admire, New Jersey's [[Bruce Springsteen]]." The Reagan campaign briefly used "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]", a song criticizing the treatment of [[Vietnam War]] veterans (which they mistakenly thought was devoid of anti-war content), as a campaign song, without permission, until Springsteen, a lifelong Democrat, insisted that they stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1014|title=Born In The U.S.A. by Bruce Springsteen Songfacts|publisher=Songfacts.com|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reagan campaign was very skilled at producing effective television advertising. Two of the more memorable ads it produced were commonly known as "[[Bear in the woods]]" and "[[Morning in America]]".

[[File:Reagan answers question about age 2nd debate of 1984.webm|thumb|right|Clip from the second debate in which Reagan responds to a question about his age]]
Reagan was the oldest president to have ever served (he was by this point 73), and there were many questions about his capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency, particularly after Reagan had a poor showing in his first debate with Mondale on October 7. He referred to having started going to church "here in Washington", although the debate was in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], referred to military uniforms as "wardrobe," and admitted to being "confused," among other mistakes.&lt;ref name="1st debate"&gt;{{cite episode| title=1984 Presidential Candidate Debate: President Reagan and Walter Mondale – 10/7/84

I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience." Mondale himself laughed at the joke,&lt;ref name="1984debate2"&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF73k5-Hiqg#t=32m55s |title=1984 Presidential Candidate Debate: President Reagan and Walter Mondale – 10/21/84 | publisher=The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation |date=April 27, 2009 |time =32:55 |people=Reagan, Ronald; Mondale, Walter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later admitted that Reagan had effectively neutralized the age issue:

Reagan was re-elected in the November 6 election in an electoral and popular vote landslide, winning 49 states. He won a record 525 electoral votes total (of 538 possible), and received 58.8% of the popular vote; despite Ferraro's selection, 55% of women who voted did so for Reagan,&lt;ref name="martin20110327"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/us/politics/27geraldine-ferraro.html?pagewanted=all | title=Geraldine A.

Roosevelt]].  Mondale's defeat was also the worst for any Democratic Party candidate in American history in the Electoral College (and his 13 electoral votes the fewest any Democrat has won since [[Stephen A. Douglas]] claimed 12 in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 election]], when the Democratic vote was divided), though others, including [[Alton B. Parker]], [[James M. Cox]], [[John W. Davis]], and [[George S. McGovern]], did worse in the popular vote.

[[Psephology|Psephologists]] attributed the Republican victory to "[[Reagan Democrat]]s", millions of Democrats who voted for Reagan, as in 1980. They characterized such Reagan Democrats as southern whites and northern blue collar workers who voted for Reagan because they credited him with the economic recovery, saw Reagan as strong on national security issues, and perceived the Democrats as supporting the poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class. The [[Democratic National Committee]] commissioned a study after the election that came to these conclusions, but suppressed the report, afraid that it would offend its key voters.{{r|prendergast1999}}

When Reagan was asked in December 1984 what he wanted for Christmas he joked, "Well, Minnesota would have been nice".&lt;ref name="ap19841204"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ATQdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m6UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4591%2C2286313 |title=Minnesota heads Reagan's wish list |work=The Tuscaloosa News |date=December 4, 1984 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=July 18, 2012 |location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan lost Minnesota in both this election and in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], making it the only state he failed to win in either election, and also making him the first two-term president not to carry Minnesota since [[Woodrow Wilson]]. This is the last election where the Republican candidate achieved any of the following: Win every state in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[Pacific States|Pacific]] regions of the United States; win at least one county in every state; and win any of the following states: [[Hawaii]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/|title=Historical U.S. Presidential Elections 1789-2016|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the last election where the Republican nominee won [[Wisconsin]] until 2016, Iowa until 2004, the last election in which the winning candidate won by a double-digit margin in the percentage of the popular vote, and the last election where the winning candidate won by an eight-digit margin in total popular votes (10 million or more).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, despite his narrow loss in Minnesota, Reagan still won in five out of its eight congressional districts (by contrast, Nixon had only carried one Massachusetts district twelve years earlier) thus making Reagan the only U.S. presidential candidate in history to win the popular vote in a majority of congressional districts in every state.

The '''2003 London blackout''' was a serious [[power outage]] that occurred in parts of southern [[London]] and north-west [[Kent]] on 28 August 2003. It was the largest blackout in [[South East England]] since the [[Great Storm of 1987]], affecting an estimated 500,000 people.

Power went off at about 18:26 [[British Summer Time]]. Power came back on after 34 [[minute]]s at 19:00 BST, but is reported to have taken about two hours to be restored fully in some areas.

==Media coverage==
Even before the blackout, the UK press were anticipating a UK equivalent of the [[Northeast blackout of 2003]] in North America, which occurred two weeks earlier (August 14) and affected about 100 times more people. For example, on August 15, The ''[[Daily Express]]'' had reported that the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] might not be able to cope with predicted power surges in the winter of 2004. 

On the day of the blackout [[Mayor of London|London Mayor]] [[Ken Livingstone]] declared the situation a "catastrophic failure" and "the normal British disease of underinvestment and not keeping your plant up to date". The press followed this lead. The power transmission company [[National Grid plc]] responded that, as they had invested £3 billion in the last 10 years, the system certainly could not be described as old and decrepit.

Headlines such as "Power cut cripples London" ([[CNN]]) concealed the fact that over 90% of London's population was unaffected (but see below for the effects on the [[London Underground]] and mainline rail services).

Later it became clear to the press that the blackout might not be directly attributable to underinvestment, but this was still the main thrust of the stories: e.g. ''[[The Independent]]'', 30 August: ''"Just admit it, Mr Urwin. National Grid needs to invest more"''.

On 8 September the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' ran a story ''"Blackout report will take weeks"'' [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/articles/6595311?source=Evening%20Standard]. On 10 September National Grid published a 43-page report describing the causes of the blackout (and made it available on the internet). The national [[BBC]] TV evening news did not cover this.

In mid October an anonymous National Grid engineer spoke to the BBC. It emerged that there may have been a maintenance problem not covered in National Grid's report (see below).

==Causes==

Initial reports were that there appeared to be a problem with a cable feed from the national grid in the [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] area of south London. A spokesman for National Grid said it was "an unusual occurrence", but "not even vaguely on the scale of [[Northeast blackout of 2003|what happened in the U.S.]]", adding that there was a fault in the 275 kV system. Later, Chief Operating Officer Mark Fairbairn said the problem was caused by the extremely rare coincidence of two faults happening only seven seconds apart.

Later National Grid's report revealed that the second fault, and the ultimate cause of the blackout, was the fitting of a wrongly rated part in a backup system - something called a [[Buchholz relay|Buchholz protection relay]] had the wrong setting; similar to fitting a 1 ampere fuse instead of a 5 ampere fuse. The first fault was a problem with a different transformer. The impression was given that this first fault was in a sense routine - about 13 such faults happen in a year. Normally it would be possible to switch the transformer that faulted first, out of the system and continue with power uninterrupted using spare capacity on the adjacent second transformer, also in Wimbledon, but in this case the switch over exposed the human error in using a part with the wrong setting on the second transformer. 

On 17 October it emerged that the first transformer fault was due to an oil leak, spotted some weeks before the blackout. The oil had been topped up but the leak had not been cured. National Grid's Director Of Transmission admitted to a "small backlog" of maintenance checks. On 21 October it became clear that the leak had been known of since March. National Grid had started a regular programme of topping-up until the transformer could conveniently be serviced. Evidently this was ultimately not enough to keep up with the leak; "it got bigger" said a spokesman.

==Effects==

The London fire brigade took around 400 calls and made 100 rescues of people stuck in lifts. All main rail services were at a standstill in south London and the south-east. Sixty percent of the [[London Underground]] was affected (London Underground had shut down the last of their independent generators in favour of using Grid supplies in 2002) and people were stuck underground. 270 sets of traffic lights were hit. To relieve the transport problems, buses accepted train and Tube tickets. Thousands of people took to the rain-soaked streets. Pubs filled up with people sitting out the delays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47133">The '''2015 Iglesia ni Cristo leadership controversy''' is a dispute between senior  members of the [[Christian denomination]] [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] (INC) in the Philippines. In July 2015, it was reported that the INC had [[Excommunication|expelled]] some of its ministers, along with high-profile members Felix Nathaniel "Angel" and [[Cristina Villanueva Manalo|Cristina "Tenny" Manalo]]. Angel is the brother of current INC Executive Minister [[Eduardo Manalo]] and Tenny is the mother of Eduardo, and widow of former Executive Minister [[Eraño Manalo]].&lt;ref name=supporters&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamil|first1=Jaymee|title=Supporters gather outside home of Manalo matriarch|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707216/supporters-gather-outside-home-of-manalo-matriarch-son#ixzz3gjR4fqaK|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angel and Tenny were expelled from the INC for allegedly "sowing disunity" in the Church. The INC administration released a statement claiming that Eduardo had agreed to the expulsion of his brother and mother from the INC, as decided upon by its overall leadership.&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt; However, both Angel and Tenny claimed their lives were threatened by the Iglesia administration. Angel and Tenny had reportedly been illegally detained at the Iglesia's Central Office Complex in [[Tandang Sora]], [[Quezon City]], and that at least ten ministers of the Church were missing and alleged to have been abducted.&lt;ref name=coverup&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cayabyab|first1=Marc Jayson|title=Manalo kin held to cover up INC scam?|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707184/manalo-kin-held-to-stop-them-from-exposing-inc-mess-minister|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former INC ministers Roel Rosal and Isaias Samson, Jr., claimed that the ''Sanggunián'' (the highest administrative council of the INC) had unlawfully abducted and detained ministers, along with members of the Manalo family, to cover up corruption surrounding the chief auditor, Glicerio "Jun" Santos, Jr.&lt;ref name=Inquirer6&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quismundo|first1=Tarra|title=SuspendedINC minister details detention|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707291/suspended-inc-minister-details-detention|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 24, 2015, INC, represented by Glicerio B.

==Overview==

===Angel and Tenny Manalo===
On July 22, 2015, a video was uploaded to [[YouTube]] featuring Felix Nathaniel "Angel" Manalo, the brother to nominal INC leader [[Eduardo V. Manalo]] and a former General Manager of GemNet (formerly the TV station of INC, replaced by [[INCTV]]), along with his mother, Cristina "Tenny" Manalo, the widow of Eraño Manalo.&lt;ref name=Youtube&gt;{{cite web|title=Bro EGM's family - Call for help|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSbDN7vEYdw|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, they claimed their lives had been threatened by the Iglesia leadership, along with that of Angel's sister, [[Lottie Hemedez]]. Tenny Manalo also claimed that there had been a mass [[kidnapping]] of ministers who had not been accounted for, implying that their disappearance somehow traced to the INC leadership, and that she had not been able to speak to Eduardo V. Manalo.&lt;ref name=ABS-CBN&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/07/23/15/iglesia-ni-cristo-expel-tenny-manalo-son-angel |title=Iglesia ni Cristo expels Tenny Manalo, son Angel |website=ABS-CBN News |date=1914-07-27 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, INC denies the claims. Bienvenido Santiago, INC's chief evangelist, announced a few hours after the video's release that INC was expelling Cristina "Tenny" Manalo, along with Felix Nathaniel "Angel" Manalo, for allegedly causing divisions in the Church and wanting to seize power.&lt;ref name="Rappler"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Francisco |first1=Katerina  |first2=Chay F. |last2=Hofileña |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100225-iglesia-cristo-manalo-expel-mother-brother |title=Iglesia ni Cristo head expels mother, brother |work=[[Rappler]] |date=23 July 2015 |accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santiago claimed that their video was a sympathy ploy to gather support to meddle in the leadership of the INC and that the INC administration was acting on the wishes of [[Eduardo V. Manalo]] to prevent discord in the Church. Edwil Zabala, a spokesman for the INC stated that the INC would consider having Tenny and Angel Manalo return to the Church if they would pledge to uphold and obey their teachings.&lt;ref name="Rappler 3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Iglesia ni Cristo head expels mother, brother|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100225-iglesia-cristo-manalo-expel-mother-brother|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Eraño "Marc" Villanueva Manalo and Lolita "Lottie" Manalo Hemedez, the younger siblings of Eduardo and Angel, were also expelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iglesia Ni Cristo announces expulsion of Eduardo Manalo's mother, siblings|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527206/news/nation/watch-iglesia-ni-cristo-announces-expulsion-of-eduardo-manalo-s-mother-siblings|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the response from the INC, an unidentified individual was photographed holding a sign saying "''Tulong'', hostage ''kami''" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''Help, we're [held] hostage'') in a building that is part of the INC Central Office in Tandang Sora, Quezon City. An interview to Angel Manalo later confirmed that it was just a "playing child" who was the promotor of the sign and is nothing serious at all. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sign outside INC building: 'Tulong, hostage kami'|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100237-iglesia-cristo-help-hostage-sign|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When contacted by reporters, INC spokesman Edwil Zabala referred them to a CD recording of Santiago's statement regarding the expulsions.

In a press briefing that same afternoon, Santiago confirmed the expulsions. Santiago said in Tagalog, "Painful as it is to our brother Eduardo Manalo, they have decided to expel those who have been causing division within the Church. That is why in future worship services of the Church of Christ, from this day, the Overall Leadership will let this be known by all of our brothers".&lt;ref name="whereare"&gt;{{cite news | first1=Marc Jayson | last1=Cayabyab | url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707189/where-are-the-missing-ministers | title=‘Where are the missing ministers?’ | publisher=Inquirer.net | date=23 July 2015 | accessdate=23 July 2015 | last2=Sauler | first2=Erika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JfCiudadINC9725PhilArenafvf 22.JPG|200px|thumbnail|Angel Manalo has criticized the Church's decision to build the [[Philippine Arena]] and suggested that funds used to build the sports venue could have been used to build more houses of worship.&lt;ref name=hitscorruption/&gt;]]

The [[Philippine National Police]], through its Quezon City Police District (QCPD), sent its personnel to the INC compound on July 23. They were able to contact Angel in the evening, and Angel himself talked to the reporters around 1:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]], denying he was detained and saying that sign pleading for help was done by a child joking around. QCPD Joel Pagdilao said that the police is ruling out case of abduction and described the concerned persons inside as peaceful and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sabillo|first1=Kristine Angeli|title=Police to ensure safety amid INC dispute — Malacañang|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707436/police-to-ensure-safety-amid-inc-dispute-malacanang|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer.net|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Cops rule out abduction in Iglesia compound|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100298-iglesia-cristo-police-tandang-sora-compound?cp_rap_source=ymlScrolly|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angel Manalo also spoke to the reporters and criticized the Church's Sanggunian, denied that he is challenging the leadership of his brother, [[Eduardo Manalo]]. He also advised his brother Eduardo against trusting people within the Sanggunian he alleged to be corrupt. He also criticized the decision's to build the [[Philippine Arena]] instead of more houses of worship. He lamented the situation that his Church is facing saying in Tagalog, "Why is it that these days, there are many anomalies? Others might say we're challenging our brother. No, we love our brother. But our problem is with people around him." He added "The doctrine of the Iglesia ni Cristo is now damaged. In the same way that you looked up to us before, now you can see there are many anomalies. There are many acts of corruption in the Church. That's what we want to avoid" &lt;ref name=hitscorruption&gt;{{cite news|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Manalo brother hits Iglesia ni Cristo 'corruption'|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100304-manalo-brother-iglesia-cristo-corruption|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2015, church guards prevented Manalo and his housekeepers from allowing members of the media to enter their ancestral house in Tandang Sora, following the inspection of the sheriff of the Quezon City RTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/747894/angel-manalo-protests-illegal-fencing-off-of-inc-manalo-compound|title=Angel Manalo protests ‘illegal’ fencing off of Iglesia family compound|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|last=Sauler|first=Erika|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court inspection  was requested by church officials in order to identify the occupants of property, following reports that unknown masked and hooded persons were going in and out of the compound which is right beside the INC central office, as well as in response to several ex-Marines who tried to go inside the INC Compound, led by renegade soldier Capt. Nicanor Faeldon, and who were only stopped by INC security. INC spokesman Zabala also claimed that the #36 TS property was owned by INC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journal.com.ph/news/top-stories/inc-cleared|title=INC cleared|publisher=Journal Online|last=Gutierrez|first=Paul M.|date=17 December 2015|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angel Manalo also protested the construction of the high fences in the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rappler.com/nation/116062-angel-manalo-eduardo-manalo-barriers-tandang-sora-residence|title=Angel Manalo to brother Eduardo: Stop building barriers in 36 Tandang Sora|publisher=Rappler|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Quezon City RTC branch 22 ordered INC to restore the electricity supply of the compound, remove and dismantle the blocking fences, and remove the guardhouse and portalet that blocked the vehicle gate #3 of the Manalo's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/116116-court-iglesia-blockade-electricity-manalo-tandang-sora|title=Court to INC: Remove blockade, restore power at Tandang Sora|publisher=Rappler|last=Cepeda|first=Mara|date=17 December 2015|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INC planned to file an ejectment case against Manalo and Hemedez if the siblings refused to leave their residence in Tandang Sora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politics.com.ph/walang-kapatid-kapatid-inc-files-ejectment-case-vs-expelled-manalos/|title=Walang kapatid, kapatid: INC to file ejectment case vs. expelled Manalos|publisher=Politiko|date=January 15, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On her part, Manalo-Hemedez said that she is the real owner of the #36 Tandang Sora compound, having been owned the property since 1983. She maintained that she and her household would not leave the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/119209-lottie-iglesia-ni-cristo-erano-manalo|title=Lottie Manalo to Iglesia: We are heirs of 'God's Messenger'|publisher=''[[Rappler]]''|last=Francisco|first=Katarina|date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidential aspirant [[Roy Señeres]] visited the compound in January 2016. Guards barred Señeres from entering and refused to let him provide the occupants with food and bottled water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Señeres dinedma ng Manalo family|publisher=''Inquirer Bandera''|date=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministers===
That same day, allegations from former and current INC ministers claimed that the Manalo family were hostages.

At least ten ministers are reported to be missing according to expelled minister Roel Rosal.&lt;ref name=coverup/&gt; One of the reported ministers, Lowell Menorca II was reported to be arrested by the [[Philippine National Police]] in [[Dasmariñas]] after two construction workers were allegedly threatened by Menorca with a grenade. Menorca's lawyer, Allen Blair Boy from the New Era University Legal Aid, questioned whether he was abducted and Boy said that Menorca told him that he was indeed arrested. It is not clear why he was in Dasmariñas, because Menorca is based in [[Sorsogon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Allegedly abducted Iglesia minister nabbed by Dasmariñas PNP|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527330/news/nation/allegedly-abducted-iglesia-minister-nabbed-by-dasmarinas-pnp|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=GMA News|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2015, Rosal reiterated his claims against the INC leadership. He also stated that the Quezon City Police were taking sides in the conflict by supporting the INC administration, and denying Angel and Tenny Manalo deliveries of food and water. Rosal also claimed that the captives in the Manalo compound were running out of food and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Araja|first1=Rio N.|title=QC cops hit for INC bias|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2015/07/29/qc-cops-hit-for-inc-bias/|website=Manila Standard|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference held July 23, INC minister Isaias Samson, Jr. cited Menorca's case alleging that the military had taken him from Sorsogon to Dasmariñas. He said that the missing ministers were held in Rosalia Compound and Caringal in Quezon City.&lt;ref name=govint/&gt;

Arnel Tumanan,&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt; Joven Sepillo of [[Tacloban]], and Nolan Olarte of [[Cebu]] are among the other reported missing ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meruenas|first1=Mark|title=DOJ steps in, orders NBI to probe ‘abduction’ of Iglesia ni Cristo ministers|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527722/news/nation/doj-steps-in-orders-nbi-to-probe-abduction-of-iglesia-ni-cristo-ministers|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INC, thru attorney Serafin Cuevas, Jr., had also filed [[libel]] charges against Samson and Joy Yuson, former administrative coordinator of GEM TV,  then the TV arm of INC, for accusing INC and its Sanggunian members of involvement in various anomalies and alleged abductions of ministers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chavez|first1=Chito|title=INC files libel charges vs expelled minister|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/inc-files-libel-charges-vs-expelled-minister/|publisher=''Manila Bulletin''|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; preliminary investigations for the said case started on September 16, 2015 at the Quezon City RTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Former Iglesia minister appears in court over libel complaint|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/106102-iglesia-ni-cristo-isaias-samson-libel-preliminary-investigation|publisher=''Rappler''|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menorca released a video on October 23, 2015, a few days after he was allegedly rescued from abduction by the Sanggunian and the filing of writ of ''habeas corpus'' by his brother Anthony and sister-in-law Jungko Azuka. In it he supported the claim that he was abducted and illegally detained from July 25-October 21 in the Central Compound together with his wife, children  and housekeeper, and orchestrated by the Sanggunian. He further claimed that he and his family never asked to the Church to give them a house, or to be put into protective custody. The supposed rescue of the Menorca Family was first supported by attorney Trixie Cruz-Angeles, the lawyer of the INC's expelled ministers, including Jun Samson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/734041/ex-iglesia-ni-cristo-minister-lowell-menorca-confirms-abduction|title=Ex-Iglesia ni Cristo minister Lowell Menorca confirms abduction|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|first=Yuji Vincent|last=Gonzales|date=2015-10-23|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the alleged illegal detention they claimed to have not been allowed to leave the premises nor had the right to accept guests. Cellphones and gadgets were also said to not be allowed in the premises. After the video was uploaded, INC expelled him and his family. The expulsion papers was signed by minister Radel Cortez.&lt;ref name=

===Isaias Samson, Jr.===
Isaias Samson, Jr., was a second-generation INC minister, former Sanggunian member and head of Foreign Department. He had been demoted due to some cases in his department to be an editor of INC's ''Pasugo'' magazine (a section of INC's Evangelism Department) and part of the Philippine government's Official Prayer Day and regular minister during prayers in SONA. He held a press conference on July 23 confirming his own detention, stating that he and his family were placed under house arrest by the INC administration, with the involvement of military and police officials. Samson stated that he was detained because of his opposition to Santos and gave a rough estimate of the amount of fund misused by Santos as in the "millions" of pesos, but he gave no evidence. Samson also stated that communication from the outside world was cut off and that passports, computers, phones and other electronic devices were confiscated. He was accused by INC leadership of being "Antonio Ebangelista," a pseudonym used by a minister who had written critical articles that reveal details on Church administration and Santos, a charge Samson denies. Samson and his family escaped by telling the guards they wanted to go to church service. Samson described his imprisonment as "unlawful detention," and called some in the INC administration "dishonest," but stated that he retained his faith in the INC.&lt;ref name="Inquirer6"/&gt; Samson later claimed corruption within the INC leadership regarding misuse of funds, such as in the "Lingap sa Mamamayan" fund, use of private planes and oil business. On July 25, 2015, INC spokesman Edwil Zabala stated that Samson and his family were expelled from the church for refusing to submit to authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former ‘Pasugo’ editor expelled from Iglesia Ni Cristo|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527642/news/nation/former-pasugo-editor-expelled-from-iglesia-ni-cristo|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samson was replaced by Dennis C. Lovendino, a minister who became the new editor of ''Pasugo'' as of the June 2015 issue.

In a separate interview with [[CNN Philippines]], INC Spokesperson Zabala said that the so-called house arrest of the family of Samson, Jr. was a disciplinary act within the Church (preventive  suspension) in which Samson was under investigation, due to his connection to the group in social media that was claiming corruption issues inside the church.

In November 17, the Department of Justice dismissed the criminal raps filed by Samson and fellow expelled member Lito de Luna Fruto against the INC leaders for lack of [[probable cause]]. Both Samson and Fruto accused INC of holding them against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/17/15/doj-junks-criminal-raps-vs-iglesia-execs|title=DOJ junks criminal raps vs Iglesia execs|last=Reformina|first=Ina|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=2015-11-17|accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
On July 24, 2015, the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] ordered the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] (NBI) to investigate allegations of abduction of INC members. However it added that it would not interfere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Francisco |first1=Katerina |title=DOJ orders probe into Iglesia ni Cristo 'abduction' |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100344-doj-probe-iglesia-cristo-abduction |accessdate=24 July 2015 |publisher=Rappler |date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Loyola |first1=Jun |title=VIDEO &amp;#124; DOJ orders probe of INC 'detentions, abductions' but Angel Manalo snubs NBI team |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/114814/video--doj-orders-probe-of-inc-detentions-abductions-but-angel-manalo-snubs-nbi-team |accessdate=July 27, 2015 |publisher=News5 Interaksyon |date=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, 2015, in a statement by Manuel Eduarte, chief of the NBI Anti-Organized Transnational Crime Division, said that the NBI concluded that insufficient evidence showed that the Iglesia ni Cristo abducted some of its ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NBI on Iglesia ni Cristo 'abduction': Case closed |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100695-nbi-iglesia-ni-cristo-abduction-case-closed |accessdate=27 July 2015 |publisher=Rappler |date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on July 29, 2015, Former Justice department secretary (now Senator) [[Leila de Lima]] clarified that the case had not been closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meruenas|first1=Mark|title=De Lima: NBI probe on Iglesia ni Cristo 'abduction' not yet closed|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/530630/news/nation/de-lima-nbi-probe-on-iglesia-ni-cristo-abduction-not-yet-closed|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=GMA News|date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Vice President [[Jejomar Binay]] criticized de Lima's "unwarranted statements" asserting that the case remained open and noted her statement contradicts the reported findings of NBI Anti-Organized Transnational Crime Division. "By your actuations, you are promoting the image of disunity, discord and even corruption in the INC to its clear prejudice and detriment," Binay said that De Lima must respect the [[separation of church and state]] and "unwarranted interference" from the government in the church must not happen. Binay also describe De Lima's dealings with the Iglesia ni Cristo controversy as similar to what he describes as a "[[Character assassination|policy of demolition]]" targeted towards his own person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VP to de Lima: Stop meddling with INC|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/vp-to-de-lima-stop-meddling-with-inc/207132/|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=The Manila Times|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests in response to the investigation===
{{main article|2015 Iglesia ni Cristo protests}}
On late evening of August 27, about 2,000 Iglesia members led by INC spokesman Edwil Zabala held a vigil outside the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] office and later moved to [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]]. The demonstrators protested against the government agency, led by De Lima, for allegedly persecuting their church and called for upholding the [[separation of church and state]]. They also called for the agency to prioritize more important issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esmaquel|first1=Paterno II|title=Iglesia ni Cristo rallies flock: ‘Inaapi tayo!’|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/104004-iglesia-ni-cristo-zabala-doj-rally-persecution|accessdate=28 August 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===Iglesia ni Cristo===

====Religious leaders====
INC general evangelist Bienvenido Santiago on July 23, 2015, responding to allegations made by the Manalos in a July 22 video, dismissed the accusations that some INC ministers were abducted and claimed that the two were attacking the church to make it appear that it was involved in the abductions. He also added that the video was an attempt to rally support from church members and to distract the church's management. Santiago said that the church's decision to expel the two Manalos was to show that the INC is a religion that follows the teachings of God found in the Bible, not a business.&lt;ref name=whereare/&gt;

In a morning Sunday worship in July 26, INC executive minister Eduardo Manalo repeated that members should strictly follow the church's leadership and rules to attain salvation.&lt;ref name=pdievm&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reyes-Estrope|first1=Carmela|title=Manalo asks Iglesia ni Cristo members to follow church leadership|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707847/manalo-asks-iglesia-ni-cristo-members-to-follow-church-leadership|accessdate=26 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer Central Luzon|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media reported that an INC member said that provincial ministers issued a set of ''tagubilin'' (instructions) towards the church's members during the weekend ahead of the church's 101st anniversary celebrations to be held in July 26 in [[Ciudad de Victoria]] complex in [[Bulacan]]. Among these reported instructions were that members decline media inquiries and travel by private cars to the celebrations. During the centennial celebrations, members were provided with service vehicles. Stickers for vehicles with "One with EVM" were reportedly distributed.&lt;ref name=pdievm2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cinco|first1=Maricar|title=Iglesia ni Cristo members told: carry ‘EVM’ tarps; shun media interviews|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707823/inc-members-told-carry-evm-tarps-shun-media-interviews|accessdate=26 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer Southern Luzon|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media reported an unusually high number of worshipers and vehicles at the INC church in [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]]. Several taurpalins bearing the words "One with EVM" were posted outside the building.&lt;ref name=pdievm2/&gt;

====Expelled members====
Expelled INC minister Roel and his spouse, Shirley Rosal told reporters on July 23, 2015 that at least 10 ministers were under [[house arrest]]. Roel Rosal claimed that auditor Jun Santos and his staff were using donations for the INC to purchase [[luxury car|luxury vehicles]]. He also said that Angel and Tenny Manalo were hostages. Roel said that the expulsion of the Manalos might have been influenced by a "third party" in the church administration.&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt;&lt;ref name=coverup/&gt;

Isaias Samson, Jr. at a July 23 press conference, said that government intervention in the crisis would help resolve the issue.&lt;ref name=govint&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torres-Tupas|first1=Tetch|title=INC crisis: Suspended minister urges gov’t intervention|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707267/inc-crisis-suspended-minister-urges-govt-intervention|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer.net|date=23 July 2015|language=English, Tagalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samson was expelled from the INC the day after his press conference.

====Other members and supporters====
Fewer than 12 supporters of the church wearing white armbands organized a vigil in support of the Manalos in front of the INC compound in Tandang Sora.&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Frustrated INC members back leader's kin|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100257-inc-members-manalo-house-rally?cp_rap_source=ymlScrolly#cxrecs_s|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2:00 am of July 25, no INC member was seen camping outside the compound.&lt;ref name=novigil&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yee|first1=Jovic|title=No vigil outside Angel Manalo’s residence|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707548/no-vigil-outside-angel-manalos-residence|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members used social media to express their support for Eduardo V. Manalo and the Sanggunian. Some members changed their profile photo to an image bearing the words  "I am one with EVM," in support of the leadership of Eduardo Manalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mateo|first1=Janvic|title=Iglesia rift widens online|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/26/1481030/iglesia-rift-widens-online|accessdate=26 July 2015|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2015, Louie Cayabyab, the minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo locale in [[Fremont, California]], resigned his position as minister as a response to the expulsions of Samson and Tenny and Angel Manalo. Cayabyab stated "Beloved brethren, there are two circulars that are supposed to be read this morning. The first circular is about the expulsion from the Church of the wife and children of Bro. Erano G. Manalo. And another circular is the expulsion from the Church of Bro. Isaias T. Samson Jr., former editor-in-chief of the ''Pasugo''. I decided, brethren, that I won’t read those circulars. You might be asking, 'why?' Because in my heart, in my heart of hearts, I can’t take it. It is, it is just so so difficult to betray one’s heart..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/528746/news/nation/iglesia-ni-cristo-minister-in-california-quits-post |title=Iglesia ni Cristo minister in California quits post &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online |website=Gmanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Cayabyab asked INC members to remain in the church, he urged them to support peaceful vigils held in their areas, and implored them to support brethren in the Philippines "who are risking their lives" to expose corruption and reform the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esmaquel|first1=Paterno|title=US-based INC minister: 'Never my intention to quit'|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100595-iglesia-ni-cristo-minister-louie-cayabyab-quit|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Cayabyab's resignation, members of the INC in [[Northern California]], numbering in the "dozens," according to [[ABS-CBN News]], held a protest at the INC's main United States office in [[Burlingame, California]], demanding an investigation and tribunal into the corruption allegations, along with the reinstatement of Angel and Tenny Manalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surprising move: Iglesia ni Cristo members in California hold protest|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/07/27/15/surprising-move-iglesia-ni-cristo-members-california-hold-protest|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a week later those who were identified as having taken part in the protests were expelled from the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conclara|first1=Rommel|title=INC expels members who joined protest in US|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/08/06/15/inc-expels-members-who-joined-protest-us|accessdate=7 August 2015|agency=ABS-CBN North America News Bureau|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of INC from 26 ecclesiastical districts picketed the Department of Justice office in [[Manila]], when Secretary Leila de Lima, on her birthday, officially announced her 2016 senatorial bid. The assembly happened a few days after former minister Samson, Jr., his wife and son, filed illegal detention charges against eight members of the Sanggunian. A respondent of the case, Bienvenido Santiago, Sr., the church's general evangelist, wanted De Lima to focus instead on the SAF 44 case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iglesia Ni Cristo Press Statement as read during Aug. 26 press conference|url=http://www.eaglenews.ph/iglesia-ni-cristo-press-statement-as-read-during-aug-26-press-conference/|accessdate=August 27, 2015|publisher=Eagle News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iglesia ni Cristo members: ‘Why, why, why, De Lima?’

====Net 25 TV interview with allegedly missing ministers====
In an interview with Eagle News Service/Net 25 on July 29, 2015, a broadcaster owned and operated by INC affiliate [[Eagle Broadcasting Corporation]], ministers Lowell "Boyet" Menorca II, Joel San Pedro, Jojo Nemis and Arnel Tumanan denied they were held captive or tortured. They also affirmed their loyalty to the church administration and executive minister [[Eduardo Manalo]] and that they were still church members. The ministers also stated that members should not believe the claims of abduction.&lt;ref name="Eagle News"&gt;{{cite web|title=INC ministers come out in the open to say they were not abducted, hit lies spread in media|url=http://www.eaglenews.ph/inc-ministers-come-out-in-the-open-to-say-they-were-not-abducted-hit-lies-spread-in-media/|website=Eagle News|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Anthony Menorca, Boyet Menorca's brother, stated that his older brother was forced to deny his abduction because INC Sanggunian was holding Boyet Menorca's wife, Seiko Otsuka Menorca, and one year old child. Anthony stated that in a meeting with his brother, he told him "Binantaan kami ng kapatid ko na kami ay papatayin" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''"My brother warned us we will be killed"'') Anthony Menorca stated that he was in an undisclosed location and feared for the life of his brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cepeda|first1=Mara|title=Sibling of ‘abducted’ minister to INC Council: Free my brother|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/101041-inc-lowell-menorca-brother-abduction|website=Rappler|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a new video released after he was allegedly rescued from the captivity of the Sanggunian on October 21, Menorca clarified, claiming that everything he said in the interview on Net 25 were "scripted".&lt;ref name=

====Interview with Boyet Menorca====
On August 1, 2015, Boyet Menorca, along with his wife and child, were interviewed in person outside the INC compound, wherein he denied all allegations of his abduction and pleaded for his brother to stop making claims. He added that he and his family voluntarily decided to stay within the compound because of safety concerns. He was worried that he could potentially be attacked in order to direct the resulting blame on the INC. After the interview, he and his family returned to the INC compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/531300/news/nation/iglesia-minister-lowell-menorca-ii-denies-church-holding-his-family-against-their-will|title=Iglesia minister Lowell Menorca II denies church holding his family against their will|date=3 August 2015|website=gmanetwork|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Menorca stated the interview was held "under duress."&lt;ref name="rappler1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/110561-lowell-menorca-iglesia-ni-cristo-abduction-story |title=Ex-minister Lowell Menorca recounts Iglesia 'detention' ordeal |website=Rappler.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Menorca recounts capture and being held hostage====
On October 21, 2015, Lowell Menorca's brother Anthony petitioned the Supreme Court of the Philippines to issue writs of ''habeas corpus'' and ''amparo'' against the INC administration. The request was granted and on October 25, Menorca stated that he was illegally detained by INC, kidnapped by police officers allegedly in INC's employ and had been interrogated for 17 hours. He also stated that police officials tried to kill him afterwards using a hand grenade and that he had to beg for his life, successfully convincing a police officer allegedly hired to murder him not to go through with the killing.&lt;ref name="rappler1"/&gt;

====Menorca's arrest in connection with libel charges====
On January 20, 2016, on his way to the Court of Appeals to attend a hearing on the illegal detention case, policemen wearing civilian clothes and without badges led by Supt. Ed Leonardo and INC member, arrested Menorca on libel charges filed by the SCAN International in Kapatagan, Lanao del Norte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/551925/news/metro/manila-cops-arrest-ex-iglesia-minister-before-ca-appearance|title=Manila cops arrest ex-Iglesia minister before CA appearance|publisher=''[[GMA News]]''|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A standoff between the police, Menorca and his wife Jinky occurred along Roxas Boulevard and Quirino Avenue when Menorca refused the arrest and claimed that the court had not notified him of libel charges.

The church, thru its spokesman Edwil Zabala, said the INC strongly denied any involvement with the standoff and told Menorca to face the libel charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/119633-iglesia-ni-cristo-lowell-menorca-arrest|title=Ex-INC minister Menorca arrested on the way to court|publisher=''Rappler''|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaglenews.ph/iglesia-ni-cristo-official-press-statement/|title=Iglesia Ni Cristo Official Press Statement|publisher=''Eagle News''|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Menorca receives asylum in Canada====
Menorca fled to [[Vietnam]] in March 2016. Moises Tolentino Jr., a lawyer for the Iglesia ni Cristo responded that: "Beset by several libel suits and an adultery charge to boot, [Menorca] took the cowardly option. He took a hurried flight last night bound for Vietnam. He is now a fugitive from justice.." and "Menorca is supposed to be the aggrieved party. If they were sincere, if they believed that they were in the right, they should not leave the country. They should face all opportunities that should be given to respondents..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/124970-lowell-menorca-fugitive-iglesia-ni-cristo|title=INC: Menorca a 'fugitive,' robbed Iglesia of chance to expose lies|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|publisher=[[Rappler]]|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menorca left Vietnam two weeks later and arrived in [[Vancouver]].

'''Abdussattar Shaikh'''' (ar عبد الستار شيخ) was an asset of the [[FBI]]’s San Diego Field Office from May 14, 1994, to July 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Review of the FBI's Handling of Intelligence Information Related to the September 11 Attacks (November 2004)|date=June 2006|publisher=U.S Department of Justice - Office of the Inspector General|url=http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s0606/final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was called "The FBI's Best Chance to Uncover September 11th Before it Happened" by the [[Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reno|first1=Jamie|title=REGION: Terrorist cell was embedded deeply in San Diego|journal=North County Times|date=September 10, 2011|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2011/sep/10/region-terrorist-cell-was-embedded-deeply-in-san/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, two of the [[hijackers in the September 11 attacks]], [[Nawaf Alhazmi]] and [[Khalid Almihdhar]], moved in with Shaikh in [[Lemon Grove, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brandon|first1=Karen|title=San Diego neighbors found nothing suspicious about pair|journal=Chicago Tribune|date=September 30, 2001|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-09-30/news/0109300355_1_hijackers-flight-training-three-san-diego}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shaikh did not provide his FBI contact Steven Butler with any information about the two; Butler claims that the names Nawaf and Khalid were only mentioned in casual conversation  as two students who had rented rooms from him, and that once Shaikh had cut a phone call short stating that "Khalid's in the room".

Butler later asked Shaikh for their surnames, but was not given them. He was not told they were pursuing flight training and that the students were non-political and have done nothing to arouse suspicion. The [[CIA]] had not provided names to the FBI which could have prevented 9-11.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Pretext for War]] by [[James Bamford]], page 231&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=November 2014}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"They were nice, but not what you call extroverted people" Shaikh told ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' after the attacks. Still, he told reporters he bonded with Alhazmi, helping him open a bank account and place a personal ad on the World Wide Web. "He told me that he wanted to marry a Mexican girl," Shaikh told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. "The problem was that he didn't know any Spanish. So I taught him a few Spanish phrases."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The FBI has aroused suspicion of its own for claiming that he was a retired professor of English at [[San Diego State University]] (SDSU)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/dnation/terror/firstweek/20010916-sdattack.html {{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vice President for International Projects at [[American Commonwealth University]] (ACU). &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ACU-advertisement.jpg|thumb|Ad for American Commonwealth University|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 17 November 2007|date=January 2012}}]]    --&gt;However it turned out that SDSU had no records of ever staffing him, and ACU was merely a scam, a [[diploma mill]], started by retired [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] [[General (United States)|General]] William Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopsicker |first1=Daniel |title=Terrorists, Arms Dealers, &amp; Ghosts in Malawi |journal=Mad Cow Morning News |date=April 11, 2005 |url=http://www.madcowprod.com/04112005.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508203254/http://www.madcowprod.com/04112005.html |archivedate=2015-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizens Review Board on Police Practices==
Shaikh sat on San Diego's Citizens Review Board on Police Practices (CRBPP) during the time frame of his co-operation with the FBI. Ethical questions arose about his qualifications for city employment, as active police informants are precluded from employment on police oversight committees for obvious reasons. Shaikh was later removed from the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raftery|first1=Miriam|title=ABDUSSATTAR SHAIKH, CO- FOUNDER OF SAN DIEGO’S ISLAMIC CENTER, HONORED FOR 50 YEARS OF SERVICE PROMOTING RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE|journal=East County Magazine|date=October 2009|url=http://www.eastcountymagazine.org/abdussattar-shaikh-co-founder-san-diego%E2%80%99s-islamic-center-honored-50-years-service-promoting-religiou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adventure Con''' was a for-profit media expo with a science fiction and comic theme held annually in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].

The convention was usually attended by sci-fi groups and clubs who set up booths annually, including the [[501st Legion]], Rebel Legion, the Dark Empire, the Knoxville Sci-Fi Club, the Tennessee Star Wars Collectors Group, and various costuming and collecting groups. In addition, the show featured a wide variety of dealers selling toys, comics, cards, and film / television memorabilia.

== History ==
Adventure Con was founded by Marcus Wollack, and was first held June 1–2, 2002, at the Knoxville Expo Center (5441 Clinton Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee). 2003 saw two shows, a late spring event and a fall event. The spring 2003 show was held at the Gatlinburg Convention Center in [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]]. Beginning in 2005, the show moved to the [[Knoxville Convention Center]] (701 Henley Street, Knoxville, Tennessee), which features nearly 50,000 square feet of exhibitor space. The 2005 show featured two full days of gaming events and tournaments. The 2006 show featured a replica of the ''[[Back to the Future]]'' [[DeLorean time machine|Delorean]].

In 2007 Adventure Con was acquired by Las Vegas Autographs, LLC. The new owners vowed to increase the emphasis on comic books and attract 10,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="KnoxNews" /&gt; The 2007 show made national news for a ''[[Star Wars]]''-themed wedding, which on June 2 was featured on nearly every local news broadcast in the nation that evening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knoxnews.com/kns/local_news/article/0,1406,KNS_347_5568216,00.html "Love written in the 'Stars'"], June 3, 2007, ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 show included a special concert by [[Smith &amp; Pyle]], and a "birthday party" for [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'s [[Jason Voorhees]].

In 2009, Adventure Con again featured two events, a summer and a fall show. For the fall show, Adventure Con moved to the [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] Convention Center located at the Grand Hotel. The 2010 show, also held at the Pigeon Forge Convention Center, was half the size of the previous year, disorganized, and many dealers complained about the poor lighting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/con-reports/adventure-con-2010-pigeon-forge-tennessee "Con Reports: Adventure Con 2010, Pigeon Forge, Tennessee,"] CBGXtra (June 26, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Adventure Con 2011, the tenth anniversary show, was originally going to be held July 10–12, 2011, back in Knoxville. However, on May 6, 2011, the home page of the Adventure Con website was updated, notifying fans that the show was being pushed back to a later date. The Celebrity Guests and Comic Book Industry Guests pages were deleted. The original celebrity guests included [[Erika Eleniak]], [[Tony Todd]], [[Tara (wrestler)]], [[Lee Arenberg]], [[Valerie Perrine]], [[Barbara Nedeljakova]], Nalini Krishan, [[Cindy Morgan]], [[Richard LeParmentier]], and [[Tony Curran]]. There was originally no information on comic book industry guests.

The tenth anniversary show was rescheduled for October 12–13, 2012, back in Knoxville. As of June 27, 2012, it had not been specified whether the original guests would still be appearing at the show.

A [[non-binding referendum|non-binding]] '''referendum on resolving the [[Beagle conflict]]''' was held in [[Argentina]] on 25 November 1984.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume II'', p67 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928358-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters were asked whether they approved of the government's [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina|negotiated settlement]] with [[Chile]], which would result in Argentina recognising the [[Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] islands as being Chilean territory. Although the plebiscite was not binding,  President [[Raul Alfonsin]] declared that he would respect the outcome of the vote. The proposal was approved by 82.6% of voters, with a turnout of 70%.

==Background==

The ruling party, the [[Radical Civic Union]], called for a vote in favor of the settlement. The opposition, headed by the [[Justicialist Party]], boycotted the process, claiming that it distracted from economic problems.&lt;ref name ="nyt"&gt;{{web cite |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/26/world/beagle-channel-treaty-approved-in-argentina.html|title= Beagle Channel Treaty Approved in Argentina|access-date=21 May 2017|author= UPI|date= 26 November 1984|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some opponents, including [[Herminio Iglesias]], called for voters to participate in the referendum and vote against. In contrast, other leaders like [[Carlos Menem]] came out in favour of the settlement.&lt;ref name ="menem"&gt;{{web cite |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MfY60uIwKP8C&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=1984+referendum+beagle&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zX2EVK6BLrW1sQSVs4HQDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=1984%20referendum%20beagle&amp;f=false|title= The rise and fall of Renewal Peronism|access-date=21 May 2017|author= James W.

Art Dubai Modern, established in 2014, is devoted to Modern art from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. Each exhibitor presents a solo, two-person or multi-artist show, featuring works by Modern masters of the 20th century, with a focus on work produced between the 1940s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/culture/arts/art-dubai-continues-its-cultural-journey-1.1687184|title=Art Dubai continues its cultural journey|last=Review|first=By Jyoti Kalsi, Special to Weekend|date=2016-03-09|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, Art Dubai Modern will move into one of the two main Contemporary halls, to allow for a better reading of the region's art history and contextualization of the Contemporary works on show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.artdubai.ae/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AD19_PR_Art-Dubai-Announces-Gallery-Line-Up-For-Its-2019-Edition_EN.pdf|title=ART DUBAI ANNOUNCES GALLERY LINE-UP AND NEW STRUCTURE FOR ITS 2019 EDITION|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this programme-cum-gallery section, multidisciplinary gallery artists from all over the world are invited to the UAE to create new works, in fully equipped Dubai and Abu Dhabi studio spaces, inspired by their experiences in the UAE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artdubai.ae/residents-2-2/|title=Art Dubai Residents - Art Dubai|last=Dubai|first=Art|work=Art Dubai|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The artists’ selection of works are displayed in a special exhibition area at the fair. The 2019 edition of Residents will focus exclusively on Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artdubai.ae/residents-2/2019/|title=Residents - Art Dubai|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bawwaba ===

Art Dubai 2019 will see the launch of Bawwaba, a unique gallery section, located within the main gallery halls. The section will feature projects by individual artists or galleries, located in or focused on the Middle East, Africa, Central and South Asia as well as Latin America.

The inaugural edition of Bawwaba will be curated by French-Cameroonian curator Élise Atangana, and focus on highly conceptual works including videos, installations and murals. The section aims to give visitors a curated reading of the Global South, acting, as its name suggests, as a gateway to current artistic developments from these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.artdubai.ae/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AD19_PR_Art-Dubai-Announces-Gallery-Line-Up-For-Its-2019-Edition_EN.pdf|title=Art Dubai|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Global Art Forum ==
The Global Art Forum is the largest annual arts conference in the Middle East and Asia and takes place every year at Art Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/blogs/map/vernacular-curatorial-practice-in-the-united-arab-emirates|title=Vernacular Curatorial Practice in the United Arab Emirates|date=2016-04-26|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference features live talks, panel discussions and performances by regional and international thought leaders, artists, curators and writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buro247.me/culture/arts/buro-24-7-middle-east-s-complete-guide-to-art-duba.html|title=Buro 24/7 Middle East's complete guide to Art Dubai|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous speakers include high-profile figures such as [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]], [[Michael Stipe]] and [[Christo]]. In 2018, the Global Art Forum was co-directed by Noah Raford and Marlies Wirth with Commissioner [[Shumon Basar]] and held under the title 'I Am Not a Robot', focusing on the timely theme of power, paranoia and potentials of automation.

== Education ==
Art Dubai’s non-for-profit educational programming, provides programmes for children through to post-graduates. Art Dubai’s education initiatives include Campus Art Dubai, a community art school for UAE-based artists, curators, writers, designers and enthusiasts, Forum Fellows, a fellowship that brings together young curators and writers from the Middle East; and The Sheikha Manal Little Artist Program for children aged 5 to 17. The fair also has an internship and volunteer programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaararabia.com/art/exhibitions/art-dubai-2016|title=Art Dubai 2016: All Roads Connect|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art Dubai Portraits ==
In Spring 2017, the fair started producing Art Dubai Portraits, a series of 1- and 3-minute films focusing on artists that are connected to the fair through its programming and participating galleries. Unique in showing the artists’ personal- and work-spaces as well as capturing their personality, the Art Dubai Portraits serve as a one-of-a-kind resource for curators and researchers working on the art from the region.

== Economic Impact ==
In March 2016, the fairs’ parent company, Art Dubai Fair FZ LLC (The Art Dubai Group), released the results of an independent survey for Art Week 2015 (March 18–25, 2015). The results show that the total economic impact the Art Dubai and Design Days Dubai events have on the local economy and service sector totaled US $35 million across seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/gn-focus/special-reports/events/art-week-paints-dubai-green-with-dh128-million-economic-contribution-1.1682149|title=Art Week paints Dubai green with Dh128 million economic contribution|last=team|first=By the GN Focus|date=2016-03-01|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/art-dubai-said-contribute-35m-local-economy-623450.html#.V7BX2_l95hG|title=Art Dubai said to contribute $35m to local economy|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/dubai-fair-showcases-success-art-10th-190215675.html?ref=gs|title=Dubai fair showcases success in art in 10th year|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cheraw jampui.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Cheraw dance]] is performed during Chapchar Kut.]]
The '''Chapchar Kut''' is a festival of [[Mizoram]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="Barthakur2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthakur|first=Dilip Ranjan|title=The Music And Musical Instruments Of North Eastern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP4vH-4oSEcC&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=8 August 2012|year=2003|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-881-5|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is celebrated during March after completion of their most arduous task of Jhum operation i.e., jungle-clearing (clearing of the remnants of burning). It is a spring festival celebrated with great favour and gaiety. Chapchar Kut is estimated to have started in 1450-1700 A.D. in a village called Suaipui. Chapchar Kut was discouraged when the Missionaries came to Mizoram as it was felt that it did not adhere to [[Christian]] values, however, it was revived in 1973 on a mass scale sans animistic practice and [[cheraw dance]].&lt;ref name="Origin of Chapchar Kut"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thanzawna|title=Origin of Chapchar Kut|url=http://www.mizoram.nic.in/about/oriofchapcharkut.htm|publisher=Mizoram.nic.in|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chapchar Kut is now held annually in the Month of March.  
Chapchar Kut is one of three annual festivals of the Mizos celebrated to mark three different stages of the agricultural cycle. The other two are Mim Kut and Pawl Kut, also revived in the last century.

Oral traditions say Chapchar Kut was first celebrated in Seipui village in adjoining Myanmar that has a sizeable population of Mizos and their ethnic cousins. Chapchar Kut used to be celebrated to thank the gods for saving the people from harm during the clearing of forest on hill slopes for jhum cultivation at the beginning of a year.

Today, the festival is observed in the last part of February or the early part of March when the trees and bamboos felled for jhum are left to dry and the shifting cultivators have time to relax and enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hindustan Times|title=Egged on: Mizoram festival revives pre-Christian custom|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/egged-on-mizoram-festival-revives-pre-christian-custom/story-e6aDSthhn8K6hFP2GeblvM.html|publisher=hindustantimes.com|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Crusade of 1101''' was a minor [[crusade]] of three separate movements, organized in 1100 and 1101 in the successful aftermath of the [[First Crusade]]. It is also called the '''Crusade of the Faint-Hearted''' due to the number of participants who joined this crusade after having turned back from the First Crusade.

Calls for reinforcements from the newly established [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and [[Pope Paschal II]], successor to [[Pope Urban II]] (who died before learning of the outcome of the crusade that he had called), urged a new expedition. He especially urged those who had taken the crusade vow but had never departed, and those who had turned back while on the march. Some of these people were already scorned at home and faced enormous pressure to return to the east; [[Adela of Blois]], wife of [[Stephen, Count of Blois]], who had fled from the [[Siege of Antioch]] in 1098, was so ashamed of her husband that she would not permit him to stay at home.

== Lombards ==
[[File:Crusade1101.JPG|thumb|left|80px|&lt;br&gt; Lombard-Tuscan man-at-arms from c. 1100,''Vita Mathildis''.]]
[[File:Anselmo.JPG|thumb|left|110px|[[Anselm IV, Archbishop of Milan|Anselm IV]]]]
As in the first crusade, the pilgrims and soldiers did not leave as a part of one large army, but rather in several groups from various different regions from across Western Europe. In September 1100, a large group of [[Lombardy|Lombards]] left from [[Milan]]. These were mostly untrained peasants, led by [[Anselm IV, Archbishop of Milan]]. When they reached the territory of the [[Byzantine Empire]], they pillaged it recklessly, and [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Alexios I]] escorted them to a camp outside [[Constantinople]]. This did not satisfy them, and they made their way inside the city where they pillaged the [[Blachernae]] palace, even killing Alexios' pet lion. The Lombards were quickly ferried across the [[Bosporus]] and made their camp at [[Nicomedia]], to wait for reinforcements.

At Nicomedia they were joined in May 1101 by a smaller but stronger contingent of [[France|French]], [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundians]], and [[Germany|Germans]], under Stephen of Blois, [[Stephen I, Count of Burgundy]], [[Eudes I, Duke of Burgundy]], and Conrad, [[constable]] of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Joining them at Nicomedia was [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]], one of the leaders of the First Crusade who was now in the service of the emperor. He was appointed overall leader, and a Byzantine force of [[Pecheneg]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]] was sent out with them under the command of General Tzitas. 
This group marched out at the end of May, towards [[Dorylaeum]], following the route taken by Raymond and Stephen in 1097 during the First Crusade. They planned to continue towards [[Konya]], but the Lombards, whose rabble outnumbered all the other contingents, were determined to march north to Niksar where [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] was being held captive by the [[Danishmends]]. After capturing [[Ankara|Ancyra]] on June 23, 1101, and returning it to Alexios, the crusaders turned north.  They briefly besieged the heavily garrisoned city of [[Gangra]], and then continued north to attempt to capture the Turkish-controlled city of [[Kastamonu]].  However, they came under attack from the [[Seljuq Turks]] who harassed them for weeks, and a foraging party was destroyed in July.

At this point, under the threats of the Lombards, the entire army turned away from the possible safety of the Black Sea coast and again moved east, toward [[Danishmend]] territory and the rescue of Bohemond.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Steven Runciman|Runciman, Steven]] (1951) [https://archive.org/stream/historyofthecrus000371mbp/historyofthecrus000371mbp_djvu.txt ''A History of the Crusades, vol. 2: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100-1187''], Cambridge University Press. p. 22-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Seljuqs, under [[Kilij Arslan I]], realizing that disunity was the cause of their inability to stop the First Crusade, had now allied with both the Danishmends and [[Ridwan of Aleppo]]. In early August the crusaders met this combined Muslim army at [[Mersivan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17461930|title=A history of the Crusades, vol. 2: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100-1187|last=Runciman|first=Steven|date=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=052134770X|location=Cambridge [England]|pages=18-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Mersivan===
The crusaders organized into five divisions: the [[Burgundians]], Raymond and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the [[Germans]], the [[French people|French]], and the [[Lombards]]. The Turks nearly destroyed the crusaders’ army near the mountains of [[Paphlagonia]] at [[Mersivan]]. The land was well-suited to the Turks—dry and inhospitable for their enemy, it was open, with plenty of space for their cavalry units. The Turks had been troublesome to the Latins for some days, at last making certain that they went where [[Kilij Arslan I]] wanted them to be and making sure that they only found a small amount of supplies.

The battle took place over several days. On the first day, the Turks cut off the crusading armies’ advances and surrounded them. The next day, [[Duke Conrad]] led his Germans in a raid that failed miserably. Not only did they fail to open the Turkish lines, they were unable to return to the main crusader army and had to take refuge in a nearby stronghold. This meant that they were cut off from supplies, aid, and communication for an attack that may have taken place had the Germans been able to provide their own military strength.

The third day was somewhat quiet, with little or no serious fighting taking place, but on the fourth day, the crusaders made an intensive effort to free themselves from the trap that they were in. The crusaders inflicted heavy losses on the Turks, but the attack was a failure by the end of the day. Kilij Arslan was joined by [[Ridwan of Aleppo]] and other powerful [[Danishmend]] princes.

The Lombards, in the vanguard, were defeated, the [[Pechenegs]] deserted, and the French and Germans were also forced to fall back. Raymond was trapped on a rock and was rescued by Stephen and Conrad. The battle continued into the next day, when the crusader camp was captured and the knights fled, leaving women, children, and priests behind to be killed or enslaved. Most of the Lombards, who had no horses, were soon found and killed or enslaved by the Turks. Raymond, Stephen of Blois, and Stephen of Burgundy fled north to [[Sinop (Turkey)|Sinope]], and returned to Constantinople by ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17461930|title=A history of the Crusades, vol. 2: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100-1187|last=Runciman|first=Steven|date=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=052134770X|location=Cambridge [England]|pages=23-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Nivernois==
Soon after the Lombard contingent had left Nicomedia, a separate force under [[William II of Nevers]] arrived at Constantinople. He had crossed into Byzantine territory over the [[Adriatic Sea]] from [[Bari]], and the march to Constantinople was free of incident, an unusual occurrence for a crusade army. He quickly marched out to meet the others, but in fact never caught up with them, although the two armies must have been close to each other on numerous occasions. William briefly besieged Iconium ([[Konya]]) but could not take it, and he was soon ambushed at [[Heraclea Cybistra]] by Kilij Arslan, who had just defeated the Lombards at Mersivan and was eager to stamp out these new armies as soon as possible. At Heraclea almost the entire contingent from Nevers was wiped out, except for the count himself and a few of his men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17461930|title=A history of the Crusades, vol. 2: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100-1187|last=Runciman|first=Steven|date=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=052134770X|location=Cambridge [England]|pages=25-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The French and Bavarians==
As soon as William II left Constantinople, a third army arrived, led by [[William IX of Aquitaine]], [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois|Hugh of Vermandois]] (one of those who had not fulfilled his vow on the First Crusade), and [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]]; accompanying them was [[Ida of Formbach-Ratelnberg|Ida of Austria]], mother of [[Leopold III of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold III of Austria]]. They had pillaged Byzantine territory on the way to Constantinople and had almost come into conflict with the Pecheneg mercenaries sent to stop them, until William and Welf intervened.

From Constantinople, the Aquitanian-Bavarian army split in two, with one half travelling directly to [[Jaffa]] by ship;&lt;ref&gt;Alan V. Murray, Ed. (2006). ''The Crusades: An Encyclopedia'', Vol. I, ABC-CLIO, Inc., p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; among them was the chronicler [[Ekkehard of Aura]]. The rest, travelling by land, reached Heraclea in September, and, like the previous army, were ambushed and massacred by Kilij Arslan. William and Welf escaped, but Hugh was mortally wounded; the survivors eventually arrived at [[Tarsus in Cilicia|Tarsus]], where Hugh died on October 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17461930|title=A history of the Crusades, vol. 2: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100-1187|last=Runciman|first=Steven|date=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=052134770X|location=Cambridge [England]|pages=27-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ida disappeared during this ambush and was presumably killed, but according to later legend she was taken into captivity and became the mother of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], a great enemy of the crusaders in the 1140s, which - however - is impossible due to chronological factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17461930|title=A history of the Crusades, vol. 2: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100-1187|last=Runciman|first=Steven|date=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=052134770X|location=Cambridge [England]|pages=29|oclc=|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
William of Nevers also escaped to Tarsus and joined the rest of the survivors there as did Raymond of Toulouse. Under Raymond's command they captured [[Tartus|Tortosa]] (Tartous), with help from a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese fleet]]. By now the crusade was more of a [[pilgrimage]]. The survivors arrived at [[Antioch]] at the end of 1101, and at [[Easter]] in 1102 arrived in [[Jerusalem]]. Afterwards, many of them simply went home, their vow having been fulfilled, although some remained behind to help King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] defend against an [[Egypt]]ian [[Second Battle of Ramla|invasion at Ramla]]. Stephen of Blois was killed during this battle, as was [[Hugh VI of Lusignan]], ancestor of the future [[Lusignan]] dynasty of Jerusalem and [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]]. [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]] also stayed behind, and survived to become [[County of Edessa|Count of Edessa]] in 1118.

The defeat of the crusaders allowed Kilij Arslan to establish his capital at Konya, and also proved to the Muslim world that the crusaders were not invincible, as they appeared to be during the First Crusade. The crusaders and Byzantines each blamed the other for the defeat, and neither of them were able to ensure a safe route through [[Anatolia]] now that Kilij Arslan had strengthened his position. The only open route to the [[Holy Land]] was the sea route, which benefitted the [[Italian maritime republics]]. The lack of a safe land route from Constantinople also benefitted the [[Principality of Antioch]], where [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]], ruling for his uncle Bohemond, was able to consolidate his power without Byzantine interference.

Both the [[Second Crusade|Second]] and [[Third Crusade]]s suffered similar difficulties when attempting to cross Anatolia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18404">The '''Don Pacifico affair''' was an episode of [[gun boat diplomacy]] which occurred in 1850 and concerned the [[Kingdom of Greece]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Portugal]]. The affair is named after David Pacifico, a British subject born in Gibraltar.

==Immediate antagonism==

The dispute arose in 1847 after the house of the Jewish former Portuguese [[Consul (representative)|consul-general]] to Greece, [[Don Pacifico|David Pacifico]], better known as "Don Pacifico" – who had been stripped of his position due to overstepping his power repeatedly in 1842, but who continued to reside in Athens &lt;ref&gt;Giannis Kairofylas, The history of Psiri District (Η ιστορία της συνοικίας του Ψυρή), Filippotis Editions, Athens 2000, p.102&lt;/ref&gt; – was attacked and vandalised by an [[anti-Semitic]] mob that included the sons of a government minister, while police looked on and did nothing. [[James Mayer de Rothschild|Mayer de Rothschild]] had been visiting Athens, during the Greek Orthodox Easter (which fell on April 4), to discuss a possible loan,&lt;ref&gt;The House of Rothschild had already loaned the Greek Government 60,000,000 francs in 1832, in order to establish the monarchy.  Niall Ferguson, ''The House of Rothschild, Money's Prophets 1798-1848'' (New York: Penguin 1998), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; and the government, in order to coax him, decided to ban the tradition of hanging the effigy of Judas,&lt;ref&gt;Some refer to this tradition as a "burning", but the Orthodox Christians were following the biblical tradition that Judas had hanged himself.  Judas must not be confused with Guy Fawkes.&lt;/ref&gt; thinking that Rothschild would be offended by the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;James Brown Scott (editor),  ''Cases on International Law'' (St. Paul: West Publishing Co., 1922), p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; As Scott reports it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It appears that it was then the custom at Athens to burn on Easter Sunday the image of Judas Iscariot. As, however, Lord Rothschild, a British subject of Jewish faith, was visiting Athens at this time, the Greek government forbade the custom. This was attributed by the populace, not to the presence of Lord Rothschild, but to the influence of Don Pacifico. Hence the outrages to his person and property.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the Greek population in Athens, incensed at the cancellation of their customs, rioted before the house of the Portuguese Consul-General. It was reported that the crowd was infiltrated by the Greek police, and that among its leaders were one or more sons of the Greek Minister of War &lt;ref&gt;Trollope, p. 119  "A Greek, of some position in his country, had been present in the streets encouraging the rioters when the house had been burnt down, and the police  had refused to notice the matter."   Ashley, p. 179-180: "M. Pacifico was a Jew native of Gibraltar, whose house was pillaged and gutted, in open day, by a mob headed by the sons of the Minister of War. While it was occurring no attempt was made by the authorities of Athens to protect him."&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days after the incident, Don Pacifico himself wrote to [[Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons|Sir Edmund Lyons]], British Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece:&lt;ref&gt;''British and Foreign State Papers. 1849-1850. [2].'' Vol. XXXIX, pp. 333-334.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;It is with much grief that I feel myself obliged to communicate to your Excellency a dreadful event which has happened to me, and as an English subject to beg your protection. Last Sunday, Easter-day, at about 12 o'clock, a crowd of people, amongst whom were some soldiers of the gendarmerie, just come out of church, presented themselves at the door of my house, which they very soon battered down with large pieces of stone. These brigands, in number about 300 or 400, entered my house, and swearing dreadfully, began beating my wife, my innocent children, and my son-in-law. After having broken the windows, doors, tables, chairs, and every other article of furniture, they robbed me of my jewels, forcing open the closets in which were vases, candlesticks, gold and silver ornaments, diamonds, and lastly a box containing money to the amount of 9,800 drachmas, of which 2,300 were my own private property, and 7,500 which had been deposited with me by the Jewish community of Italy for the projected erection of a temple, and for the poor of this kingdom. These barbarians did not even leave me the Consular Portuguese archives, which were torn by them to pieces. These papers being my security from that nation for the sum of 21,295 l. 1s. 4d. sterling.&lt;/blockquote&gt; It is clear that Don Pacifico was a man of many facets. He had been the Portuguese Consul-General in Athens until 1842,&lt;ref&gt;Giannis Kairofylas, The history of Psiri District (Η ιστορία της συνοικίας του Ψυρή), Filippotis Editions, Athens 2000, p.102&lt;/ref&gt; and had possession of the Legation's archive. He had previously been Portuguese Consul-General in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;according to Lord Palmerston, in Alden,  ''Representative British Orations''  Volume 4, p. 156.  He was appointed to Morocco in February, 1835: Bracebridge, p. 10 n.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a leader of the Jewish community in Athens, in possession of money earmarked to build a synagogue in Athens. His house was not, as alleged by his and Palmerston's enemies, a poor hovel, but the very house in which the head of the Regency Council of [[King Otho of Greece|King Otho]], Count [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg]], had lived during the Regency (1832-1835) and as Arch-Secretary to the King (1835-1837).&lt;ref&gt;Alden, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
    
On May 20, 1847, Lyons informed the Foreign Office in London &lt;ref&gt;''British and Foreign State Papers. 1849-1850. [2].'' Vol. XXXIX, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; that he had applied to the Greek Government for compensation for Don David Pacifico, a [[British subject]], for loss of possessions, including documents relating to a substantial claim against the Portuguese government for monies owed. Lord Palmerston advised Lyons to have Pacifico draw up an itemized valuation of his losses, and, if his statement were supported by satisfactory proof, to present a note to the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs requiring him to direct that the sum be paid to Don Pacifico. Pacifico complied on February 22, 1848, and Lyons duly dispatched a demand for payment to M. Drossos Mansolas, the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs. He also wrote to M. Constantine Colocotronis, the Prime Minister. Colocotronis rejected Pacifico's claims, with the same objections used by his predecessor in office, M. Colettis.&lt;ref&gt;''British and Foreign State Papers. 1849-1850. [2].'' Vol. XXXIX , pp. 372-382.&lt;/ref&gt; The objections of the Greek government were that the claimed damages were impossibly great, with some estimates going as far as to state that the claimed sum was larger than the value of the Greek Royal Palace, while the Greek government also considered this to be an affair of the Judiciary, not the Executive branch.&lt;ref name=Eleftheroudakis&gt;''Eleftheroudakis Encyclopedia'', "Perkerika" entry&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 1848, David Pacifico again wrote to Lyons, mentioning that sixteen months had passed since the incident and no satisfaction had been forthcoming. Moreover, he had been forced to abandon his house during the Easter celebrations of 1848; and he drew to the attention of Lyons that several years earlier two Jews had been massacred at Patras, and likewise the Synagogue at Negroponte had been burned down.&lt;ref&gt;''British and Foreign State Papers. 1849-1850. [2].'' Vol. XXXIX , pp. 382-388.&lt;/ref&gt; After additional exchanges of letters among all the parties, on October 15, 1848, Don David Pacifico again appealed to the British Government to obtain justice for him and the settlement of his claims.

Already on December 3, 1849, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], a [[Philhellenism|philhellene]] and supporter of the [[Greek War of Independence]] of 1828-1829, had decided to take definitive action to settle the problems caused by Greek intransigence. King Otto and his government, in addition to refusing to settle claims of British citizens, had stopped payments on the loan of 1832. Palmerston wrote to Sir [[Thomas Wyse]], the British Minister in Athens,&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, 183.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;I have desired the Admiralty to instruct Sir [[Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Shenstone|William Parker]] to take Athens on his way back from the Dardanelles, and to support you in bringing at last to a satisfactory ending the settlement of our various claims upon the Greek Government. You will, of course, in conjunction with him, persevere in the ''suaviter in modo'' as long as is consistent with our dignity and honour, and I measure that time by days--perhaps by some very small number of hours. If however, the Greek Government does not strike, Parker must do so. In that case you should embark on board his fleet before he begins to take any hostile steps, in order that you and your mission may be secure against insult. He should, of course, begin by reprisals; that is, by taking possession of some Greek property; but the King would probably not much care for our taking hold of any merchant property, and the best thing, therefore, would be to seize hold of his little fleet, if that can be done handily. The next thing would be a blockade of any or all of his ports....&lt;/blockquote&gt;  On January 22, 1850, Admiral Sir William Parker reported &lt;ref&gt;Ashley, 187-188.&lt;/ref&gt; that all the vessels of the Greek government had been detained, but that the machinations of the French Minister Thouvenot and the Prussian Chargé d'affaires were encouraging King Otto to resist. The Greek Government and the Greek people had been thoroughly humiliated by the British, who were also trying to push their desired outcomes on other disputes with the Greek government, especially pertaining to the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]], such as:

* The British claims on the islands of Sapientza and Elafonisos for the United States of the Ionian Islands (a British protectorate)
* Compensation for six ships that were robbed
* Placation for an insult to the British flag and disrespect towards the British Ambassador, Mr. Boyde
* Compensation for two Ionian Islanders who had been abused in [[Pyrgos, Elis|Pyrgos]]
* Compensation for Mr. Finley's barn, which had been included in the Royal Gardens of Athens without compensation&lt;ref name=Eleftheroudakis/&gt;

Greece was a state under the joint protection of Britain, [[France]], and [[Russia]], and the imposition of the blockade caused a diplomatic conflict between Britain, on the one hand, and France and Russia on the other. France and Russia objected to the blockade and the French Ambassador in London, [[Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys]], was temporarily withdrawn by the French Government, causing the British to abandon demands not directly linked to the Don Pacifico Affair.&lt;ref name=Eleftheroudakis/&gt; The affair also caused considerable damage to the reputation of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]] in Athens. The blockade lasted two months and the affair ended only when the Greek government agreed to compensate Pacifico, being regarded as one of the prime examples of [[Gunboat Diplomacy]].

==Political fallout in London==

At Westminster, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|both houses of parliament]] took up the issue of British foreign policy, especially with regard to Greece, with considerable energy. On June 17, 1850, Lord Edward Stanley (the future [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|14th Earl of Derby]]), the Leader of the Conservative Opposition in the [[House of Lords]], proposed a motion in the House: "That, while the House fully recognizes the right and duty of the Government to secure to Her Majesty's subjects residing in foreign states the full protection of the laws of those states, it regrets to find, by the correspondence recently laid upon the table by Her Majesty's command, that various claims against the Greek Government, doubtful in point of justice or exaggerated in amount, have been enforced by coercive measures directed against the commerce and people of Greece, and calculated to endanger the continuance of our friendly relations with other powers." &lt;ref&gt;Ashley, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; After a memorable debate on June 17, 1850, the House of Lords voted in favour of the Opposition motion, by a majority of 37, which was a rebuke to Lord Palmerston's policies.

However, the House of Commons did not proceed along the same lines as the Lords. The MP for Sheffield, [[John Arthur Roebuck]], an independent and sometimes contrarian member, sent the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in a different direction, to reverse this condemnation, by proposing "That the principles on which the foreign policy of Her Majesty's Government have been regulated have been such as were calculated to maintain the honour and dignity of this country; and in times of unexampled difficulty, to preserve peace between England and the various nations of the world." A debate ensued, which lasted four nights. Palmerston delivered a famous five-hour speech in which he sought to vindicate not only his claims on the Greek government for Don Pacifico, but his entire administration of foreign affairs. "As the [[Roman citizenship|Roman]], in days of old, held himself free from indignity, when he could say, ''[[Civis romanus sum|Civis Romanus sum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"I am a Roman citizen."&lt;/ref&gt; so also a British subject, in whatever land he may be, shall feel confident that the watchful eye and the strong arm of England will protect him from injustice and wrong."{{Ref|speech}} He was answered by [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Speeches of the late Right Honourable Sir Robert Peel, Bart.''  Volume IV, 846-855.&lt;/ref&gt; in what turned out to be his last speech to the Commons, and by [[William Ewart Gladstone|W. E. Gladstone]].&lt;ref&gt;G.W.E. Russell, ''The Right Honourable William Ewart Gladstone''  pp. 102–110.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government carried the motion by 310 to 264, a majority of forty-six, in favor of Palmerston's conduct of foreign affairs.

==Pacifico's settlement==

The claims of the British Government were settled by a Convention, agreed between Her Britannic Majesty and His Hellenic Majesty on July 18, 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Scott,  ''Cases on International Law, principally selected from Decisions of English and American Courts'', p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt; The King agreed to make good to Mr. Pacifico any real injury which could be proved, after a full and fair investigation.

Don Pacifico's outstanding claims were submitted to a special Commission, composed of the French, British and Greek ministers in Lisbon. The Commissioners met in Lisbon in February. 1851. The Commission discovered in the archives of the Cortes at Lisbon a petition addressed by Don Pacifico to the Cortes in 1839, accompanied by voluminous documents to prove his claims. The claims had yet to be addressed by the Cortes. The Commission awarded Don Pacifico the sum of £150, owed by the Greek Government.&lt;ref&gt;Scott,  ''Cases on International Law, principally selected from Decisions of English and American Courts'' pp. 511-513.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pacifico received 120,000 drachmas and £500 in the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11839-pacifico-case | title=PACIFICO CASE | publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com. | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Jacobs, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Douglas R. Stringfellow''' (September 24, 1922 – October 19, 1966)&lt;ref name=congress&gt;{{cite web | title=STRINGFELLOW, Douglas R. | work=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]] | publisher=[[United States Congress]] | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S001006 | accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Republican [[one-term congressmen|one-term congressman]] in the United States House of Representatives, best known for lying about his war record, education and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hoaxes.org ] | Jonas, Frank | (1966) | The Story of a Political Hoax: The Adventures of PFC Douglas R. Stringfellow | University of Utah Institute of Government | [http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/douglas_r._stringfellow]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biographical background ==
Stringfellow was born in [[Draper, Utah]].  While attending public schools, he moved to [[Ogden, Utah]], where he graduated from [[high school]] in 1941.  He then attended [[Weber College]] until entering into service in the [[Army Air Force]] during [[World War II]] from 1942 to 1945. In France, Stringfellow was wounded from a mine explosion, leaving him walking with the aid of a cane, for which he received the [[Purple Heart Medal]].&lt;ref name=congress/&gt;

As a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), Stringfellow served as a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]] in [[Northern California]] from 1947 to 1948. Stringfellow returned to pursue a career in broadcasting, serving as an announcer and executive for a Utah radio station from 1949 to 1952.&lt;ref name=congress/&gt;

== 1952 election ==
In 1952 Stringfellow, a political unknown, was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[Utah]]. Much of the appeal of his candidacy lay in his decorated past as a hero during [[World War II]], a past which he made frequent reference to during his revival-style campaign speeches. Stringfellow was able to take advantage of [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s landslide presidential victory and defeated his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, Ernest McKay, in a rout of 76,545 votes (60.5%) to 49,898 votes (39.5%). His victory in the open-seat contest was a gain for the Republican Party.

Stringfellow claimed to have served as an agent of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] during the war. He claimed that at one point he had participated in a top-secret mission to rescue a German atomic physicist, [[Otto Hahn]], from behind enemy lines and transport him to England. He also claimed that he had been captured by the Germans and held in [[Belsen|Belsen Prison]], where he had been brutally tortured, causing him to become a paraplegic. Stringfellow said that while lying wounded he had undergone an intense religious experience, and it was through this new-found faith, as well as the aid of the anti-Nazi underground, that he had escaped from the prison. He claimed that he had been awarded the [[Silver Star]] for his heroic service.

Stringfellow's colorful past was widely broadcast in the media. It even aired on the popular national television show ''[[This is Your Life]]''. Stringfellow also frequently traveled around Utah preaching about his wartime religious experience with the blessing of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.sltrib.com] | December 30, 2013 | Scandalized Utah congressman believed his false war stories, Douglas Stringfellow's autobiography says he preferred being seen as lying about WWII service and not "crazy." | By Lee Davidson | The Salt Lake Tribune [http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=57246509&amp;itype=CMSID]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1954 election and exposure ==
Stringfellow served one term and was running for reelection in 1954 when his past was exposed as a fraud by his Democratic opponents. They revealed that Stringfellow was not actually a paraplegic. He had been wounded from a mine explosion during a routine mission in France, but he could walk with the aid of a cane.

Furthermore, Stringfellow had not worked for the OSS. He had been a private in the [[Army Air Forces]], and he had never earned the [[Silver Star]]. Stringfellow also claimed that he had attended [[Ohio State University]] and the [[University of Cincinnati]], but neither institution had any record of his attendance.

When his Democratic opponents exposed him, the LDS Church pressed Stringfellow to make a public confession,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} which he did. The House Republican leadership forced him to abandon his bid for reelection, and replaced him on the ballot just sixteen days before the election with [[Utah State University|Utah State Agricultural College]] president [[Henry Aldous Dixon|Henry Dixon]], a candidate of undisputed integrity. Dixon managed to hold on to the seat for the Republicans in an election in which the Democrats took back control of the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hoaxes.org] | Stein, Gordon. Encyclopedia of Hoaxes. 192-193 | [http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/douglas_r._stringfellow]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years and death ==
Stringfellow tried to capitalize on his notoriety by going on a speaking tour, but it proved unsuccessful. He briefly resumed his career as a radio announcer and worked at various stations throughout Utah while always using a pseudonym. He died at the age of 44 from a heart attack in [[Long Beach, California]]. At the time of his death he was living in obscurity and working as a landscape painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=(marriages and deaths) | date=October 28, 1966 | journal=[[TIME]] | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899393-1,00.html | accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Eglinton Tournament of 1839''' was a re-enactment of a [[medieval]] [[jousting|joust]] and revel held in [[Scotland]] on Friday 30 August.&lt;ref name="EglintonT"&gt;Corbould. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded and organized by [[Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton|Archibald, Earl of Eglinton]], and took place at [[Eglinton Castle]] in [[Ayrshire]]. The Queen of Beauty was [[Georgiana Seymour, Duchess of Somerset|Georgiana, Duchess of Somerset]]. Many distinguished visitors took part, including [[Prince Louis Napoleon]], the future Emperor of the French.

The Tournament was a deliberate act of [[Romanticism]], and drew 100,000 spectators. It is primarily known now for the ridicule poured on it by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]s. Problems were caused by rainstorms. At the time views were mixed: "Whatever opinion may be formed of the success of the Tournament, as an imitation of ancient manners and customs, we heard only one feeling of admiration expressed at the gorgeousness of the whole scene, considered only as a pageant. Even on Wednesday, when the procession was seen to the greatest possible disadvantage, the dullest eye glistened with delight as the lengthy and stately train swept into the marshalled lists".&lt;ref&gt;Aikman 1839.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants had undergone regular training.

The preparations, and the many works of art commissioned for or inspired by the Eglinton Tournament, had an effect on public feeling and the course of 19th-century Gothic revivalism. Its ambition carried over to events such as the lavish Tournament of Brussels in 1905, and presaged the [[historical reenactment]]s of the present. Features of the tournament were actually inspired by  [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[Ivanhoe]]'': it was attempting "to be a living re-enactment of the literary romances".&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Eglinton’s own words "I am aware of the manifold deficiencies in its exhibition&amp;nbsp;— more perhaps than those who were not so deeply interested in it; I am aware that it was a very humble imitation of the scenes which my imagination had portrayed, but I have, at least, done something towards the revival of chivalry".&lt;ref&gt;Literary Gazette, 1831:90.&lt;/ref&gt;

While others made a profit, Lord Eglinton had to absorb losses.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Earl's granddaughter, Viva Montgomerie recalled in her memoirs that "he had spent most of the wealth of the estate".&lt;ref&gt;Montgomerie, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Eglinton Tournament armour.JPG|left|thumb|150px|An item of a knight's armour from the 1839 tournament]]
The [[Gothic Revival]] and the rise of Romanticism of the late 18th and early 19th centuries were an international phenomenon. Medieval-style jousts, for example, were regularly held in Sweden between 1777 and 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gothic fiction|Gothic novels]], such as ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', by [[Horace Walpole]] (1717–1797) and the many works of [[Sir Walter Scott]] popularised the idea of passionate romanticism and praise of [[Chivalry|chivalric ideals]]. Walpole himself was one of the first in England to renovate his mansion into a mock-Gothic castle, [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill]] (1749–1777).

Medieval culture was widely admired as an antidote to the modern [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and [[industrial age]].&lt;ref&gt;This is pretty much the entire thesis of Girouard's book.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plays and theatrical works (such as ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', which in 1820 was playing in six different productions in [[London]] alone)&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; perpetuated the romanticism of knights, castles, feasts and tournaments. [[Caspar David Friedrich]] (1774–1840) of Germany painted magnificent Gothic ruins and spiritual allegories. [[Jane Austen]] (1775–1815) wrote her novel ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (written 1798, published 1817) as a satire on romantic affectation.

[[File:Lance point.JPG|right|thumb|A lance or [[gonfalon]] tip from the Eglinton Tournament as found in the nearby Lugton Water in 2008]]
The Montgomerie family had a romantic tale of chivalry which bound them to the idea of a revival of such ideals, this being the acquisition of the [[pennon]] and spear of [[Harry Hotspur]], aka Sir Henry Percy, at the [[Battle of Otterburn]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott, page 209&lt;/ref&gt; by a Montgomerie. The price for Hotspur's release was the building of the [[Polnoon Castle|castle of Polnoon]] in [[Eaglesham]], Renfrewshire for the Montgomeries. It is said that the [[Duke of Northumberland]], head of the Percy family, made overtures for the return of the pennon in 1839 and was given the answer, "There's as good lea land at Eglinton as ever there was at Chevy Chase (Otterburn); let Percy come and take them."&lt;ref name="Robertson3"&gt;Robertson. p 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, p 492&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pennon of Sir Henry (Hotspur) Percy, Battle of Otterburn.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The pennon of [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)|Sir Henry Percy]]]]
In 1838 [[British Whig Party|Whig]] Prime Minister [[Lord Melbourne]] announced that the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]] would not include the traditional medieval-style banquet in [[Westminster Hall]]. Seeking to disempower the monarchy in particular and romantic ideology and politics in general was a normal activity for the Whig party, so, in the face of recession, the more obviously anachronistic parts of the coronation celebrations would be considered an extravagance. Furthermore, memories of embarrassing mishap at George IV's Westminster Hall banquet were still fresh;&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, pp. 5–9&lt;/ref&gt; uproar having resulted when, at the end of the proceedings, people tried to obtain valuable tableware as souvenirs. King William IV had cancelled his banquet to prevent a repeat.&lt;ref name="Hankinson"&gt;Hankinson, Cytil F. J. (1953), ''The Story of the Coronation''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there was some popular support for government refusal to hold the traditional event, there were "many complaints and various public struggles, as well as on the part of the antiquaries, as on that of the tradesmen of the metropolis".&lt;ref name="Ann. Reg 1838, p. 96"&gt;''Ann. Reg.'', 1838, p. 96, ''Chron.'', cited in Anstruther, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics referred to Victoria's slimmed-down coronation scornfully as "The Penny Crowning".&lt;ref name="Ann. Reg 1838, p. 96"/&gt; Despite attempts to achieve economies, contemporary accounts point out that Victoria's coronation in fact cost £20,000 more than that of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. Nevertheless, her coronation did feature an innovation: the procession from the palace to [[Westminster Abbey]], which was very popular.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor. p 328.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it was not just the ancient Great Feast itself which had been cancelled but also other rituals which traditionally were not paid for by the state anyway such as the throwing down of the gauntlet by the Queen's Champion, and his symbolic presentation to her of two falcons. "Obeisance to the past was in 1839 was not just a fad; for some, it was an urgent need". Lord Eglinton’s own stepfather, [[Sir Charles Montolieu Lamb, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Lamb]], as [[Knight Marshal]] of the Royal Household, would have led his horse into the Great Hall of Westminster as part of one of these colourful and widely loved rituals. On 4 August 1838, the "Court Journal" printed a rumour that the Earl of Eglinton, was going to host a great jousting tournament at his castle in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Girouard, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that it was Sir Charles or his son&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayrshirehistory.org.uk/Shorts/localhero.htm Explanation of family reasons for the holding of the Tournament].&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested to Lord Eglinton that he should provide the nation with its missing rites of passage by holding a great mediaeval festival himself, but whatever the details, within a few weeks Eglinton had confirmed the rumour true.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the suggestion was that mediaeval games would be held at the next private race meeting at Eglinton, including the ceremony of the challenge carried out by a knight clad in armour.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
[[File:John Campbell Jamieson.jpg|left|thumb|170px|John Jamieson, Private Secretary to the Earl &amp; central to the organisation of the Eglinton Tournament, assisted by a factor, Stewart Blair, "Clerk to the Tournament".&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Eglinton Tournament Jug.JPG|170px|thumb|A contemporary Tournament Jug.]]
In autumn of 1838 one-hundred and fifty prospective knights&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; met in the showroom of Samuel Pratt, a dealer in [[Plate armour|medieval armor]] at No. 47 Bond Street, London.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  Many backed out when they realised the astronomical costs and difficulties, but "about forty" were determined to try regardless.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt was to be in charge of all the arrangements, the pavilions and armour, banners, decor and costumes. He also would supply the stands, marquees and great tents for the feast and ball. Although all the armour supplied by Pratt was supposed to have been genuinely medieval, it is unclear how many of the suits actually were; the only armour that was kept track of, that of the 3rd Marquess of Waterford, on display in 1963 at Windsor Castle, is a [[pastiche]].&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the armour used was on loan from the [[Tower of London]] and, not realising at that time that changes in diet and health since the late Middle Ages had increased average stature, it was noted with interest that mostly the suits were too small and had to be ''let out'' before they could be worn.&lt;ref name="Pride"&gt;Pride, David (1910). ''A History of the Parish of Neilston''. Pub. Alexander Gardner, Paisley. p 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The family sold the Earl of Eglinton's own armour during the 1925 sale of the castle contents.&lt;ref&gt;Eglinton Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eglinton Tournament Jugs.JPG|thumb|200px|A set of commemorative jugs.]]
The dress rehearsals were held in London at a garden behind the Eyre Arms, St John's Wood,&lt;ref&gt;Girouard, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; a tavern close to [[Regent's Park]],&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; the last one on Saturday 13 July 1839. Nineteen knights participated. The audience was invitation only; many of "the very elite of the most elite" (said the "Court Journal") were invited to watch, and 2,690 attended. The rehearsal went perfectly. The weather was sunny, the banners and armour and tents impressive, the jousting successful. Even critics conceded that the tournament was likely to be a fine show.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, pp. 161–163&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass-production of memorabilia copies of artworks commissions for the tournament demonstrated that it was not only upper-class Britain that took notice. Tories eyed antique armour and dreamed of [[courtly love]], and Queen Victoria twice noted in her diary that she had discussed the tournament with Lord Melbourne and although her view was that the event would be a foolish amusement, the choice of the Duchess of Somerset as Queen of Beauty was to her liking.&lt;ref&gt;Swinney, Page 25&lt;/ref&gt; With only two months to live that tragic figure, [[Lady Flora Hastings]], wrote in 1839 to her mother on the subject of the upcoming Eglinton Tournament, expressing her concern that one of the knights might be killed in the violent sport.&lt;ref&gt;Swinney, Page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the Whigs, the social reformers, and the [[Utilitarians]] expressed outrage at such a fantasy at a time when the economy was in a shambles, when poverty was rampant and many workers were starving. Emotions ran high, with satirical cartoons, insults and passions aroused on both sides, the Whigs calling the Tories wastrels and the Tories calling the Whigs heartless. Whatever Eglinton's original intent, the tournament was symbolic of romantic defiance in the face of the spirit of revolution that was frightenting so much of old guard Europe during the second quarter of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Girouard, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrain===

{{main|Eglinton Loch}}

[[File:A map of the Eglinton Tournament features.jpg|right|thumb|A map showing the layout of the various features associated with the Eglinton Tournament. Note the lakes either side of the bridge,&lt;ref name="Tait"&gt;''[[Tait's Edinburgh Magazine]]''. November 1839.&lt;/ref&gt; formed around 1800.&lt;ref name="Stoddart"&gt;Stoddart. p 313.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There were some problems with the planning and location of the tournament. Eglinton Castle, eight miles from the west coast of Scotland in Ayrshire, was imitation Gothic, an 18th-century Georgian mansion with battlements and turrets added.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The near-coastal mountainous terrain was prone to frequent, torrential rains.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tournament was held on a meadow or holm at a loop in the [[River Irvine|Lugton Water]]. The ground chosen for the tournament was low, almost marshy, with grassy slopes rising on all sides.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; The Knights on horseback and their retinue reached the [[Tiltyard|tilt yard]] ('C' on the map) via an enclosed ride ('G' on the map), whilst the guests and visitors made their way to the stands via the route marked 'F' on the map illustrated. Both groups crossed over the three arched Gothic [[Eglinton Tournament Bridge]]. An 1837 map of ''Eglinton Castle, Grounds and Tilt yard'' shows that the tilt yard was already in extistence at this early date, but it is not recorded what its fate was after the tournament was over.&lt;ref name="Anstruther"&gt;Anstruther. p 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowds===

Lord Eglinton announced that the public would be welcome; he requested medieval fancy dress, if possible, and tickets were free but would have to be applied for. Expecting a healthy turnout&amp;nbsp;— the Eglinton race meetings generally got local audiences of up to 1500&amp;nbsp;— he made arrangements for grandstands for the guests and comfortable seating for the expected crowd of about 4000. He notified the press (''[[The Times]]'', the ''[[Morning Post]]'', the ''Court Gazette'', and "the other important or popular journals") of the offer of free tickets to all.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, pp. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eglinton tournament invitation.jpg|right|thumb|An official invitation.]]

The response returned from across the social spectrum: readers of the ''Bath Figaro'', the ''Cornish Guardian'', the ''[[Sheffield Iris]]'', the ''Wisbech Star in the East'' and many other newspapers&amp;nbsp;— readers "from every county in the British Isles"&amp;nbsp;— applied to Lord Eglinton for tickets. Through the month of August letters came by the hundreds into Castle Eglinton requesting tickets for parties of twenty, fifty, a hundred people.

A scrapbook of nearly a thousand of these letters still survives, filled with pleas, anecdotes, promises of medieval dress, and assertions of Tory sympathies. Lord Eglinton accepted the challenge, issued the requested tickets and planned for a vastly larger effort.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, pp.168–176&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation and lodgings===
With a turnout two orders of magnitude greater than expected (the final estimate was a crowd of one hundred thousand),&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt; area transportation and lodgings were overwhelmed. The nearby town of [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] had only one hotel. Private homes were able to charge very high prices to take in the tourists.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of the tournament the roads to Eglinton Castle were quickly jammed. The road from [[Ayr]] to [[Glasgow]] (thirty miles long) was filled end to end, and every approach was blocked by abandoned carriages, their owners continuing on foot.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;  The new [[Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway|railway from Ayr to Irvine]] had just opened to the public on 5 August 1839, and it now charged thrice the normal fee; people fought for the tickets, as it was the only transport guaranteed to deposit them only a few miles from the castle.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Some poor folk without lodgings are said to have spent the first night beneath the grandstand or even in hollow tree-trunks.&lt;ref&gt;Swinney, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; 

One visitor who travelled from London took steam trains from London to Liverpool, where he boarded a [[paddle steamer]] packed with people attending the tournament, its deck heavily laden with boxes, armour, lances and horses of participants. They landed at [[Ardrossan]] pier, terminus of the horse-drawn [[Ardrossan and Johnstone Railway]]: "''Disembarking, we seized upon a sort of carriage which plied upon a coal train and carried a large assortment of passengers, all drawn by one horse, and set out for the little town of Irvine. Dismounting thence, we changed after a time into divers coaches and cars, and turning into a romantic and wooded road, passed close by the lodge of the Castle of the Lord of the Tourney.''" After looking round the busy preparations, he returned to Irvine and found lodgings in a private house across the street from [[Seagate Castle]], then next morning made his way to the tournament.{{sfn|Curling|1839|pp=8–10, 13–14}}

[[File:Eglinton tournament jousting.jpg|thumb|right|The procession passing the Queen's Gallery.]]

The final difficulty was the great parade of knights that was supposed to open the tournament at noon. The knights had had little practice mounting their horses and took a long time to get prepared. Then each knight and his entourage (forty different groups) was supposed to ride to the castle, pick up a lady, officer or knight, and return to the lists. But there was only one drive to and from the castle, so that the knights had to jostle back and forth past and through each other. There had been no arrangement for parade control, and the knightly gridlock took hours longer to unfold than had been planned. By the time the parade was ready, it was a half mile long and over three hours late.&lt;ref name="Anstruther, pp. 194–195"&gt;Anstruther, pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tournament==

The intended day was 29 August but steady rain caused a postponement.

The opening parade comprised forty knights, each with his own entourage who were to ride to the castle, picked up a lady, officer or knight, and returned to the lists, the picturesque estate drive being lined with thousands of spectators.

Elaborate rehearsals and training in St John’s Wood had not prepared participants for the crowded and already sodden conditions on the day and the opening parade took three hours longer than planned to marshal.&lt;ref name="Anstruther, pp. 194–195"/&gt;

Although the day had dawned clear and fine, as the knights and their entourages struggled to organise the parade the sky began to darken. Just at the moment when the parade was finally arranged&amp;nbsp;— just as Lady Somerset, the Queen of Beauty, was heralded by trumpets&amp;nbsp;— there was a flash of lightning, a great crash of thunder, and the black clouds of Ayrshire let loose with a sudden and violent rainstorm.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Eglinton immediately ordered the ladies into carriages,&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; but the knights and their entourages, soon soaked in the squall and covered in mud, marched into the lists down a parade route lined by the umbrella bearing audience.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, pp. 202-203&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A view of the lists. Eglinton Tournament..jpg|thumb|right|A view of the lists.]]

The tiltyard was designed by Samuel Luke Pratt, with stands to hold 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;Mancoff. pp 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt's grandstand roof, was a work of art in splendid scarlet, but, after days of rain and now in a new rainstorm of freak severity, it started to leak badly.

Unsurprisingly, the unmanageably large crowds did not return on the second day.

===Notable participants===
[[File:Eglinton tournament view.jpg|right|thumb|A knight tilting at a ring at the Eglinton Tournament.&lt;ref name= "Tournament"&gt;Aikman &amp; Gordon.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Aftermath==
[[File:Detail of the Eglinton Trophy, Earl of Eglinton..jpg|thumb|left|[[Eglinton Trophy]] detail of the Earl's armour.]]
After the tournament Lord Eglinton appeared in the lists, apologised for the rain, and announced that, weather permitting, they would try to joust again the next day or the next. Then he announced to the special guests in the grandstand that the medieval banquet and ball that evening would have to be cancelled as banquetting tents had also succumbed to the weather.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt;

The rains had flooded the Lugton Water, which ran around the Lists on three sides. No carriages could cross it, so the entire audience, apart from Eglinton's personal guests, was stranded without transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; They had to walk miles through the rain and the mud to nearby villages, where only the first people found any food, drink, accommodation or transport.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

It did however succeed in publicity terms. "Perhaps the most spectacular manifestations of the Medievalist movement were the Grand Tournaments; historical pageants featuring elaborate ceremonies, costumes, sets, re-enactments of battles and jousting displays. Between 1750 and 1839 at least eighteen of these events were staged throughout Europe, the final being the Eglinton Tournament. This event stands as one of the most glorious and infamous follies of the 19th century. Although a torrential downpour resulted in the 'knights' and their mounts struggling through mud and sleet, all but invisible to the enormous crowd, Eglinton struck a sympathetic chord in the Victorian imagination. It served to whet the public’s appetite for medieval martial spectacle, and this was partly appeased by a 'Tournament and Siege' produced at Astley’s Amphitheatre a few weeks later."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ejmas.com/jmanly/articles/2001/jmanlyart_wolf2_0801.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; William Gilmor of Baltimore, who was there, the next year introduced tourneys in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;"Gilmor, a superb rider&amp;nbsp;— handsome, rich, well-bred and well-read, hosted the most elaborate [[quintain (jousting)|quintain]] tournament ever held on American soil."[http://www.nationaljousting.com/history/romantic.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eglinton Trophy]] or Eglinton Testimonial is a Gothic style one metre high silver centrepiece presented to the 13th Earl of Eglinton by friends and admirers to commemorate the 'Eglinton Tournament'.

Panoramas illustrated the tournament, using long strips of painted canvas wound round a tube and slowly unwound to give a view of the event. The venue was Edinburgh in 1839 or 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Swinney, Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

It inspired a successor event in July 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vikingsword.com/lacy/lakinga.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A local pub was named after the event. The Tourney Inn, located at 119 Fergushill Road, Kilwinning was built in 1968 and demolished in 2008. It was designed in the shape of a twin peaked marquee and contained many internal references to the 1839 tournament.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Armour used at the tournament has been preserved in the Leeds Armoury, [[Kelvingrove Museum]], [[Dean Castle]] and elsewhere.

The remnants of the tournament were sold off at a public auction and the glasses and crystal used in the marquees for the medieval ball and feast were sold off soon after. A ship named the 'Eglinton' was partly constructed from the wood used for the jousting arena.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomerie, Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-18th-century Scottish 'Basket Hilted Back Sword', the hilt elements including a forward [[quillon]] and an oval rein aperture, from Eglinton Castle, is now in the [[Royal Ontario Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[faganarms.com/amid18thcenturyscottishbaskethi... Faganarms Accessed: 2009-12-24]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bow used at the tournament by one of the Cochran-Patrick family of Ladyland House is preserved in the Kilwinning Abbey Tower Museum. This bow was made by David Muir of Kilwinning, using Degame wood, otherwise known as lemonwood.

The flag that flew over the castle bearing the earl's coat of arms was eventually donated to North Ayrshire Council and is now kept in the North Ayrshire Heritage Centre.

==Tournament Bridge==
This outstanding Gothic bridge was not actually built at the time of the tournament and even the previous bridge, originally located 100 yards further up the river, had been in place for at least 25 years at the time of the tournament. The label [[Eglinton Tournament Bridge|Tournament Bridge]] has stuck, despite the inaccuracy. Contemporary engravings and paintings show that it was however heavily embellished with Gothic additions for the event and possibly an ornamental archway.&lt;ref&gt;The Tournament, Page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===1989 re-enactment===
As 1989 was the 150th anniversary of the tournament, the staff of the newly opened [[Eglinton Country Park]] organised a re-enactment which ran over a period of three days in August of that year.

A '''Gang Show''' is a theatrical performance by members of [[Scouting|Scouts]] and [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Guides]]. Some Gang Shows have leaders of [[Scouting|Scouts]] and [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Guides]] on stage too. Leaders, youth members and parents help behind the scenes. The aim is, through performance, to empower young people to make a positive contribution to society. 

The production teams and cast (all volunteers) plan, write, compose, choreograph, build scenery and props, make costumes and rehearse for several months. A typical show requires 3 to 6 months of rehearsals. Every show does it differently, but every show has the same three priorities. 1. it is for the young people - 2. it is a public shop window on Scouting &amp; Guiding, and therefore a great PR opportunity - 3. If they are lucky, they will at least break even. 

Performance runs range from one day to two weeks, and tickets are available to the public. While a Gang Show is purely an amateur production, the costs can be similar to a professional production.

==Gang Show format==
The format is a [[revue]] or variety show; song, dance and short comedy sketches are the most common. The number of items varies between 12 and 25, some stand-alone, others a series of songs to a chosen theme or a running gag.

The format was created  by [[Ralph Reader]], the original producer, who wrote material including the signature tune, ''Crest of a Wave''. Other "[[Standard (music)|standards]]" Reader wrote include ''Strolling'', ''Great Great Game'', ''Gee, It's A Wonderful life'', ''A Touch of Silver'', ''Three Cheers'', ''Show Time'', ''Together'', ''These are the Times'' and ''The Scout Hymn''.

==History==
[[Image:Gang Show 75th Anniversary.png|thumb|right|Woven badge issued to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of Gang Show productions]]
In 1931, Reader, a Rover Scout trying to make his mark in theatre in the USA and London, was asked to write a Scout-based variety show to raise money for a swimming pool at [[Downe Scout Activity Centre|Downe Scout Camp]] (now a [[Scout Activity Centre (The Scout Association)|Scout Association National Activity Centre]]). Rehearsals began under Reader's direction on 25 May 1932, his 29th birthday.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/hi2/glasgowgangshow/ralphhistory.html Ralph Reader tells the history of the Gang Show]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the show did not have a title, but during a rehearsal break, Reader recalled, he asked a cast member if everyone was ready, to which the response was "Aye, aye Skip, the gang's all here". The first production, ''The Gang's All Here'', ran between 30 October and 1 November 1932 at the [[Scala Theatre]] in central London.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The show was not a sell-out but enough was raised to fund the swimming pool and the show was well received. [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]], the founder of scouting, persuaded Reader to produce another show in 1933. This was ''The Gang Comes Back'' and ran for a week.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Reader continued to write and produce the London Gang Show. In 1934 the show became ''The Gang Show'' and ''Crest of a Wave'' was performed for the first time, becoming over the years the anthem.

In 1937 the London show became the first amateur production to have a [[Royal Command Performance]] (an honour repeated in 1957 and 1964). A feature film called [[The Gang Show (1937 film)|The Gang Show]], starring Ralph Reader and The Gang, premièred at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]] in April the same year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/lyceummelvilles.html The Lyceum Theatre and the Melvilles]&lt;/ref&gt; and in New York in December 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028916/ IMDb: The Gang Show (1938)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
[[Image:Cgs scarf.jpg|thumb|left|A typical show scarf – this one is from Cumberland Gang Show in Australia]]
When the Gang Show started in London in 1932, Reader organised the cast as a [[Scout Troop]]; an arrangement which persists only in a few shows now. Members of the first troop wanted an identifying feature, deciding on a red [[Scarf#Scarves as uniforms|scarf]] or necker. The red scarf has become a worldwide symbol, and to distinguish shows, an insignia in gold thread (UK: the initials GS in Reader's handwriting shot through with the show's name - AUS: usually a design related to the masks of comedy and tragedy and incorporating the show's name) is embroidered into the point of the scarf. Ralph Reader was originally called "The Holborn Rover" and was with the 4th Holborn Group whose scarf was half red and half green. Reader chose to have the gang show scarf red to be part of the 4th Holborn.

Members of shows in the United Kingdom used to only be allowed to wear the scarlet scarf if they were nationally recognised, i.e. they came up to prescribed minimum standards of performance and production. It is now worn by almost all Gang Shows, but shows still need to apply for National Recognition every 5 years in order to maintain standards.

In 1972, Reader founded the London Gang Show Fellowship so current and former members of the London show could keep in touch. Membership later expanded to anyone interested in Gang Show.

More than 200 boys of all ages are involved in the second Mississaug...]&lt;/ref&gt; While individual in character, they share the ethos of Reader's concept and have common elements, often including a finale performance of ''Crest of a Wave''.

In 1958 Reader went to Chicago to produce and direct the first Gang Show in America.  He returned to Chicago next year to guide the second. Reader first went to Chicago in 1920 as a teenager and began his stage career there.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Council's 1959 Gang Show souvenir program.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glasgow Gang Show has, with few exceptions, run every year since April 1936.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clydescouts.org.uk/spage-events_info-glasgow_gang_show.html Glasgow Gang Show&lt;/ref&gt; Peterborough Gang Show started in November 1937 and apart from the war years has run ever since.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peterboroughgangshow.com/gangshowspast.html Peterborough Gang Show&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harpenden]] Gang Show has performed every year since 1949, making it the longest continuously running Gang Show in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hwgangshow.org.uk Harpenden Gang Show/&lt;/ref&gt; {{cn|date=January 2018}} &lt;!-- suggest only entries here for shows that started before 1950.

== Gang Show Spin Offs ==
In some countries an over 18 only show often referred to as a Bag Show are produced, often with a dinner and a more cabaret style and with more adult content such as risque jokes &amp; burlesque elements. This is done for Rover Scouts and Leaders.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

In Melbourne, Australia the Show Times came out of the strong theater culture of the area. These are smaller than the local Gang Show originally pulling form a single district to produce a show. Currently there are 4 of these shows Whitehorse Showtime, South Metro Showtime, Camberwell&amp;nbsp;Showtime and Strzelecki Showtime. Because these showtimes are not Gangshows they do not have the red scarf instead choosing a different color such as Strzelecki Showtime's gold Scarf.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Signature tunes==
[[Image:We ll do the hailing.jpg|thumb|right|''We'll do the hailing'']]
'''On the Crest of a Wave''' has become the signature tune throughout the world{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and is usually performed at the end. It may be sung as just the chorus (traditionally twice, the first time with gusto, the second part-quiet and staccato, part with gusto once more) but there are also two verses.

'''A Touch of Silver''' (sometimes referred to as "Silver on the Scarlet"), written by Reader and [[Brisbane Gang Show]] producer Hugh "Kirra" McKee, is the signature tune of the [[Brisbane Gang Show]] and may be sung by any show that has performed for at least 25 seasons.

''Globus'' is one of EPH's flagship publication along with ''[[Jutarnji list]]'' daily. The magazine is published by 4 Media EPH d.o.o. on a weekly basis.&lt;ref name=pufac/&gt;

Originally devised as [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], it never took an openly chauvinist approach of ''[[Slobodni tjednik]]'' and always tried to give the appearance of objectivity. Gradually, its articles began to deal with shady aspects of privatisation, abuses against ethnic [[Serb]] citizens and other topics not covered by mainstream media in Croatia. As such ''Globus'' is credited for introducing [[investigative journalism]] in Croatia. The magazine covers articles on corruption, [[fraud]], [[abuse of power]] and [[political assassination]]s.&lt;ref name=pufac&gt;{{cite web|title=Globus.

'''''Hamilchama al hashalom''''' is a 1968 film directed by [[Jules Dassin]]. A version in French was released under the title ''Comme un éclair'', and the English language release was titled ''Survival 1967''.

==Synopsis==
This film documentary uses the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] and its immediate aftermath as its basis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Cowie|Cowie, Peter]]. 1977. ''World Filmography: 1967'', London: Tantivy Press, p. 294. {{ISBN|0-498-01565-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material primarily presents Israeli sources and perspectives. It has been characterized as an anti-war screed. The film was panned for presenting little footage documenting the war, as well as for conflicting, alternating viewpoints and overall lack of narrative focus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9402E0DC1539E63ABC4A52DFB0668383679EDE ''Survival 1967'' (1968)], Adler, Renata, ''The New York Times,'' movie review, 12 June 1968.

'''Victoria Helen McCrae Duncan''' (25 November 1897 – 6 December 1956) was a Scottish [[Mediumship|medium]] best known as the last person to be imprisoned under the British [[Witchcraft Act of 1735]]. She was famous for producing fraudulent [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] made from [[cheesecloth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgess McHargue]]. (1972).

==Early life==
(Victoria) Helen MacFarlane was born in [[Callander]], [[Perthshire]] on 25 November 1897, the daughter of a [[slater]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaskill|first=Malcolm|title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=January 2008|chapter=Duncan  [née MacFarlane], (Victoria) Helen McCrae (1897–1956)}}&lt;/ref&gt; At school, to the distress of her mother (a member of the [[Presbyterian]] church), she alarmed her fellow pupils with her dire prophecies and hysterical behaviour.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; After leaving school, she worked at [[Dundee Royal Infirmary]], and in 1916 she married Henry Duncan, a cabinet maker and wounded [[war veteran]], who was supportive of her supposed supernatural talents. In 1926 she developed from clairvoyant to medium by offering séances in which she claimed to summon the spirits of recently deceased persons by emitting [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] from her mouth. A mother of six, she also worked part-time in a [[bleach]] factory.

==Practising medium==
[[File:Helen Duncan fake ectoplasm.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of a 1928 [[séance]] revealing Duncan with dolls (by Harvey Metcalfe).]]

In 1928 the photographer Harvey Metcalfe attended a series of [[séance]]s at the house of Duncan. During a séance he took various flash photographs of Duncan and her alleged "materialization" spirits including her [[spirit guide]] "Peggy".&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Gaskill. (2001). ''Hellish Nell: Last of Britain's Witches''. Fourth Estate. p. 100. {{ISBN|978-1841151090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs that were taken reveal the "spirits" to be fraudulently produced, such as a [[doll]] made from a painted papier-mâché mask draped in an old sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Karl. (2007). ''An Illustrated History of the Haunted World''. New Holland Publishers. p. 79. {{ISBN|978-1845376871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, the [[College of Psychic Studies|London Spiritualist Alliance]] (LSA) examined Duncan's method. An early examination of pieces of Duncan's [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] revealed it was made of [[cheesecloth]], paper mixed with the white of egg and lavatory paper stuck together. One of Duncan's tricks was to swallow and regurgitate some of her ectoplasm, and she was persuaded to swallow a tablet of [[methylene blue]] before one of her séances by the LSA committee to rule out any chance of this trick being performed, and because of this no ectoplasm appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Renée Haynes]]. (1982). ''The Society for Psychical Research 1882–1982: A History''. MacDonald &amp; Co. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-0356078755}} "The London Spiritualist Alliance had fifty sittings with her between October 1930 and June 1931; for these sittings she was stripped, searched and dressed in 'seance garments'. Two interim reports in ''Light'' were favorable, a third found indications of fraud. Pieces of 'ectoplasm' found from time to time differed in composition. Two early specimens consisted of paper or cloth mixed with something like white of egg. Two others were pads of surgical gauze soaked in 'a resinous fluid'; yet another consisted of layers of lavatory paper stuck together. The most usual material for 'ectoplasm' however, seemed to be butter muslin or cheesecloth, probably swallowed and regurgitated. Distressing choking noises were sometimes heard from within the cabinet; and it was interesting that when she was persuaded to swallow a tablet of methylene blue before one of the seances at the London Spiritualist Alliance, no ectoplasm whatsoever appeared."&lt;/ref&gt; The committee in a report concluded that the "material was swallowed by Mrs Duncan at some time previous to the sitting and subsequently regurgitated by her for the purpose of exhibition."&lt;ref name="Simeon Edmunds 1966"&gt;[[Simeon Edmunds]]. (1966). ''Spiritualism: A Critical Survey''. Aquarian Press. pp. 137–144&lt;/ref&gt;

A piece of ectoplasm from one of Duncan's early séances was obtained and secured in a bottle of distilled water. It was given to the psychical researcher [[Harry Price]], director of the [[National Laboratory of Psychical Research]], who was originally enthusiastic about the sample. However, when he gave the sample to a chemist for analysis it was discovered to be made from [[egg white]] mixed with chemicals. Price later duplicated Duncan's ectoplasm with similar substances.&lt;ref name="Tabori 1961"&gt;[[Paul Tabori]]. (1961). ''The Art of Folly''. Prentice-Hall International, Inc. pp. 180–182. {{ISBN|978-1111236632}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Helen-duncan-cheesecloth.jpg|thumb|right|Duncan with fake [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] made of cheesecloth and a cut out face from a magazine.]]

In 1931 Price paid Duncan £50 to perform a number of test séances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth which was then regurgitated as "ectoplasm".&lt;ref name="Roach 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price]]. (1942). ''Search for Truth: My Life for Psychical Research''. Collins. p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan that it was made of cheesecloth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]]. (2008). ''Phantasmagoria: Spirit Visions, Metaphors, and Media into the Twenty-first Century''. Oxford University Press. p. 299. {{ISBN|978-0199239238}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reacted violently at attempts to X-ray her, running from the laboratory and making a scene in the street, where her husband had to restrain her, destroying the controlled nature of the test. According to Price in a report of the mediumship of Duncan:&lt;ref name="Tabori 1961"/&gt;

{{quote|At the conclusion of the fourth seance we led the medium to a settee and called for the apparatus. At the sight of it, the lady promptly went into a trance. She recovered, but refused to be X-rayed. Her husband went up to her and told her it was painless. She jumped up and gave him a smashing blow on the face which sent him reeling. Then she went for Dr. William Brown who was present. He dodged the blow. Mrs. Duncan, without the slightest warning, dashed out into the street, had an attack of hysteria and began to tear her seance garment to pieces. She clutched the railings and screamed and screamed. Her husband tried to pacify her. It was useless. I leave the reader to visualize the scene. A seventeen-stone woman, clad in black sateen tights, locked to the railings, screaming at the top of her voice. A crowd collected and the police arrived. The medical men with us explained the position and prevented them from fetching the ambulance. We got her back into the Laboratory and at once she demanded to be X-rayed. In reply, Dr. William Brown turned to Mr. Duncan and asked him to turn out his pockets. He refused and would not allow us to search him. There is no question that his wife had passed him the cheese-cloth in the street. However, they gave us another seance and the "control' said we could cut off a piece of "teleplasm" when it appeared. The sight of half-a-dozen men, each with a pair of scissors waiting for the word, was amusing. It came and we all jumped. One of the doctors got hold of the stuff and secured a piece. The medium screamed and the rest of the "teleplasm" went down her throat. This time it wasn't cheese-cloth. It proved to be paper, soaked in white of egg, and folded into a flattened tube... Could anything be more infantile than a group of grown-up men wasting time, money, and energy on the antics of a fat female crook.}}

Price in his report published photographs of Duncan in his laboratory that revealed fake [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves and cut-out heads from magazine covers which she pretended to her audiences were [[spirit]]s.&lt;ref name="Simeon Edmunds 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price]]. (1933). ''Leaves from a Psychist's Case-Book''. Victor Gollancz Ltd. pp. 203–207&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]], who attended two of the séances, pronounced her "whole performance fraudulent" in an appendix to the report.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, Elizabeth R. (2011). ''Spooks and Spoofs: Relations Between Psychical Research and Academic Psychology in Britain in the Inter-War Period''. History of the Human Sciences 25: 67-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the report written by Price, Duncan's former maid Mary McGinlay confessed in detail to having aided Duncan in her mediumship tricks, and Duncan's husband admitted that the ectoplasm materializations were the result of regurgitation.&lt;ref name="Simeon Edmunds 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Tabori]]. (1961). ''The Art of Folly''. Prentice-Hall International, Inc. p. 182 {{ISBN|978-1111236632}} "In November 1931, Harry Price's report was issued, whereupon a Miss Mary McGinlay, came forward. She was Mrs Duncan's personal maid at the time of the séances and she made a statutory declaration before a Commissioner of Oaths that she used to purchase for Mrs. Duncan lengths of cheesecloth which she had to wash out after a séance. She also swore on oath that Mr. Duncan had informed her on the night of the scene at the National Laboratory that his wife had "passed a roll of butter muslin to him when they were alone in the street."&lt;/ref&gt;

In a séance on 6 January 1933 in [[Edinburgh]], a little girl called Peggy emerged in the séance room. A sitter named Esson Maule grabbed her and the lights were turned on and the spirit was revealed to be made from a [[stockinette]] undervest.&lt;ref name="Tabori 1961"/&gt;  The police were called and Duncan was prosecuted and fined £10.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Buckland]].

''The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication'' Visible Ink Press. p. 117. {{ISBN|978-1578592135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undervest was used as evidence which led to Duncan's conviction of fraudulent mediumship at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court trial on 11 May 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price]]. (1933). ''Leaves from a Psychist's Case-book''. Gollancz. p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

The spiritualist journal ''[[Light (spiritualist journal)|Light]]'' endorsed the court decision that Duncan was fraudulent and supported Price's investigation that revealed her ectoplasm was cheesecloth.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelgrove, Jenny. (2000). ''Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars''.

In 1936 psychical researcher [[Nandor Fodor]] offered money to Duncan if she would be filmed with an [[Thermographic camera|infrared camera]] during a séance; she refused.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Paley, Simon Fowler.

==HMS ''Barham'' sinking==
[[File:Helen Duncan with roll of cheesecloth.png|thumb|left|upright|Duncan with a roll of [[cheesecloth]] held by her mouth and poked in her right nostril.]]

During [[World War II]], in November 1941, Duncan held a séance in [[Portsmouth]] at which she claimed the spirit materialization of a sailor told her [[HMS Barham (04)|HMS ''Barham'']] had been sunk.&lt;ref name="Simeon Edmunds 1966"/&gt; Because the sinking of HMS ''Barham'' was revealed, in strict confidence, only to the relatives of casualties, and not announced to the public until late January 1942, the [[Royal Navy|Navy]] started to take an interest in her activities. Two lieutenants were among her audience at a séance on 14 January 1944. One of these was a Lieutenant Worth who was not impressed as a white cloth figure had appeared behind the curtains claiming to be his aunt but he had no deceased aunt. In the same sitting another figure appeared claiming to be his sister but Worth replied his sister was alive and well.&lt;ref name="Simeon Edmunds 1966"/&gt; Worth was disgusted by the séance and reported it to the police. This was followed up on 19 January, when undercover policemen arrested her at another séance as a white-shrouded [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|manifestation]] appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correspondent|title=Alleged Séance Deception|date=24 March 1944|journal=[[The Times]]|location=London|issue=49813|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved to be Duncan herself, in a white cloth which she attempted to conceal when discovered, and she was arrested.&lt;ref name="Simeon Edmunds 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alleged Séance deceptions. Further evidence for the prosecution.|last=Correspondent|date=25 March 1944|journal=[[The Times]]|location=London|issue=49814|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Graeme Donald wrote that Duncan could have easily found out about HMS ''Barham'' and she had no genuine [[psychic]] powers. According to Donald:

{{cquote|The loss of HMS ''Barham'', torpedoed off the coast of Egypt on 25 November 1941, was indeed kept quiet for a while, but letters of condolence were sent out to families of the 861 dead, asking them to keep the secret until the official announcement. So, allowing for perhaps 10 people in each family, there were about 9,000 people who knew of the sinking; if each of them told only one other person, there were 20,000 people in the country aware of the sinking, and so on – hardly a closely guarded secret. In short, news of the sinking spread like wildfire; Duncan simply picked up the gossip and decided to turn it into profit.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Donald. (2009). ''Loose Cannons: 101 Things They Never Told You About Military History''. Osprey Publishing. p. 48. {{ISBN|978-1846033773}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A leak concerning HMS ''Barham'' was later discovered. A secretary of the [[First Sea Lord|First Lord]] had been indiscreet to Professor Michael Postan of the [[Minister of Economic Warfare|Ministry of Economic Warfare]]. Postan said that he believed he had been told officially, and was not arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel West. (2010). ''Historical Dictionary of Naval Intelligence''. Scarecrow Press. p. 98. {{ISBN|978-0810867604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan was found to be in possession of a mocked-up HMS ''Barham'' hat-band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=British Lion, the Witch and Her Wardrobe.|last=Correspondent|date=31 January 1998|journal=[[The Times]]|location=London|issue=49814|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This apparently related to an alleged manifestation of the spirit of a dead sailor on HMS ''Barham'', although Duncan apparently did not know that after 1939 sailors' hat bands carried only 'H.M.S.' and did not identify their ship.&lt;ref name="Simeon Edmunds 1966"/&gt; She was initially arrested under section 4 of the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]], a minor offence tried by magistrates. The authorities regarded the case as more serious, and eventually discovered section 4 of the Witchcraft Act 1735, covering fraudulent "spiritual" activity, which was triable before a jury. Charged alongside her for conspiracy to contravene this Act were Ernest and Elizabeth Homer, who operated the Psychic centre in Portsmouth, and Frances Brown, who was Duncan's agent and went with her to set up séances. There were seven counts, two of conspiracy to contravene the Witchcraft Act, two of obtaining money by false pretences, and three of the common law offence of public mischief. The prosecution may be explained by the mood of suspicion prevailing at the time: the authorities were afraid that she could continue to reveal classified information, whatever her source was.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/52289.stm Spell broken for 20th century witch]''. BBC, 31 January 1998&lt;/ref&gt; There were also concerns that she was exploiting the recently bereaved, as the [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] noted when passing sentence.&lt;ref name="medium sentenced (Times) 04-04-1944"/&gt;

Duncan's trial for fraudulent witchcraft was a minor [[cause célèbre]] in wartime London. Alfred Dodd, an historian and senior [[Freemason]], testified he was convinced she was authentic. The trial was complicated by the fact that a police raid on the séance in Portsmouth, leading to the arrest of Helen Duncan, yielded no physical evidence of the fraudulent use of cheesecloth, and was therefore based entirely on witness testimony, the majority of which denied any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Helena Normanton]]. (1945). ''The Trial of Mrs. Duncan''. Edited with a Foreword by [[C. E. Bechhofer Roberts]]. Jarrolds Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan was barred by the judge from demonstrating her alleged powers as part of her defence against being fraudulent. The jury brought in a guilty verdict on count one, and the judge then discharged them from giving verdicts on the other counts, as he held that they were alternative offences for which Duncan might have been convicted had the jury acquitted her on the first count. Duncan was imprisoned for nine months, Brown for four months and the Homers were [[Binding over|bound over]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; After the verdict, [[Winston Churchill]] wrote a memo to Home Secretary [[Herbert Morrison]], complaining about the misuse of court resources on the "obsolete tomfoolery" of the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Repeal of the Witchcraft Act==
In 1944, Duncan was one of the last people convicted under the [[Witchcraft Act 1735]], which made falsely claiming to procure spirits a crime. She was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment. When convicted, she cried out "I have done nothing; is there a God?".&lt;ref name="medium sentenced (Times) 04-04-1944"&gt;{{cite news | title=Medium Sentenced For Fraud | newspaper=[[The Times]] | location=London, England | date=1944-04-04 | page=2 | publisher=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/toil-and-trouble-the-last-witch-789353.html|title=Toil and trouble: the last witch?|last=McSmith|first=Andy|authorlink=Andy McSmith|date=29 February 2008|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=1 June 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On her release in 1945, Duncan promised to stop conducting séances, but she was arrested during another one in 1956. She died at her home in Edinburgh a short time later.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Duncan's trial almost certainly contributed to the repeal of the Witchcraft Act, which was contained in the [[Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951]] promoted by [[Walter Monslow, Baron Monslow|Walter Monslow]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Barrow-in-Furness (UK Parliament constituency)|Barrow-in-Furness]]. The campaign to repeal the Act had largely been led by [[Thomas Brooks (Labour politician)|Thomas Brooks]], another Labour MP, who was a spiritualist. Duncan's original conviction still stood, and it was the subject of a sustained campaign to have it overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/notoriouscriminalsfeatureseries/Fraudulent-medium-or-powerful-psychic.2672279.jp|title=Fraudulent medium or powerful psychic: the trial of a Scottish witch|last=Howie|first=Craig|date=24 October 2005|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=12 September 2011|location=Edinburgh|quote="Mediums demand pardon for the murder of Helen Duncan'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/hellish-nell-witch-hunt-that-led-to-capture-of-fake-medium-1-1193285|title=Hellish Nell: Witch-hunt that led to capture of fake medium|date=24 February 2009|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=31 May 2012|quote=many spiritualists, who have campaigned to have her 1944 conviction quashed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Contrary to what some [[Spiritualism|spiritualists]] have written there was nothing strange or unusual about the death of Duncan and it was not caused by her "trance" being disturbed by the police. Duncan's medical records showed that she had a long history of ill-health and as early as 1944 she was described as an obese woman who could only move slowly as she suffered from heart trouble.&lt;ref name="Simeon Edmunds 1966"/&gt;

==Legacy==

After her death, Duncan was cited in paranormal and [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] books as an example of a fraudulent medium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Tabori]], (1961). [[Simeon Edmunds]]. (1966). [[Georgess McHargue]], (1972). [[Renée Haynes]], (1982). [[Paul Kurtz]], (1985). [[Mary Roach]], (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, she retained supporters amongst the spiritualist community.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Barbanell, (1945). Alan Crossley, (1976). Manfred Cassirer, (1996). Hartley,  (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; On this, Jenny Hazelgrove has noted:

{{blockquote|Her Opponents condemned her mediumship out of hand while her supporters took up the opposite position. Any suspicious aspects of the Duncan mediumship – the wood-pulp 'ectoplasm', the 'ectoplasmic' drapery that resembled cheese cloth – were glossed over by her followers in the interests of producing a wholly idealised picture of her life and mediumship.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Hazelgrove. (2000). ''Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars''. Manchester University Press. p. 222. {{ISBN|978-0719055591}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

The psychical researcher [[Simeon Edmunds]] also noted that spiritualists have a history of ignoring the evidence of fraud in the Duncan case. He criticized the spiritualist press such as ''[[Psychic News]]'' for biased reporting and distorting facts.&lt;ref name="Simeon Edmunds 1966"/&gt; Science writer [[Mary Roach]] in her book ''[[Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife]]'' (2007) favorably mentioned Price's methods in debunking Duncan as a fraudulent medium.&lt;ref name="Roach 2007"/&gt; Richard Denham's book ''Weird War Two'' focuses on the absurdity of Duncan being charged and convicted as a witch in the [[British propaganda during World War II|paranoia of wartime Britain]], particularly the frustration of Winston Churchill, who himself had been ordained into the [[Ancient Order of Druids]]

Inspired by her legacy, [[new wave of British heavy metal]] band Seventh Son recorded and released a song 'The Last Witch In England' in 2009, depicting her life and her 'prediction' of the sinking of HMS ''Barham''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/spirit-world/id325446095?i=325446458&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4|title=Spirit World, Tracklisting|work=[[iTunes Store]]|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naval investigation and subsequent trial was dramatized as a radio play. ''The Last Witch Trial'' by Melissa Murray, starring [[Joanna Monro]] as Duncan and [[Indira Varma]] as the undercover investigator, was broadcast by [[BBC Radio 4]] on 4 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sknzt|title=Afternoon Drama, The Last Witch Trial|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descendants and supporters of Duncan have campaigned on several occasions to have her posthumously pardoned of witchcraft charges. Petitions for a posthumous pardon were rejected by the Scottish Parliament in 2001, 2008, and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-18456106|title=Britain's 'last witch': Campaign to pardon Helen Duncan|work=BBC.com|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan's supporters maintain a website and online petition where they continue to campaign for her pardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helenduncan.org.uk/|title=The Official Helen Duncan|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30259">{{History of the Cold War}}
As soon as the term "[[Cold War]]" was popularized to refer to postwar tensions between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], interpreting the course and origins of the conflict became a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists and journalists.&lt;ref name = "Nashel"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nashel|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of [[Soviet Union–United States relations]] after the [[World War II]] and whether the conflict between the two [[superpower]]s was inevitable, or could have been avoided.&lt;ref name = "Brinkley 1986 798_799"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brinkley|1986|pp=798–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was, what the sources of the conflict were and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides.&lt;ref name="Halliday"&gt;{{Harvnb|Halliday|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the explanations of the origins of the conflict in academic discussions are complex and diverse, several general schools of thought on the subject can be identified. Historians commonly speak of three differing approaches to the study of the Cold War: "orthodox" accounts, "revisionism" and "post-revisionism". However, much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories&lt;ref name="Byrd 2003"&gt;{{Harvnb|Byrd|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recent scholars have tended to address issues that transcend the concerns of all three schools.

== Pro-Soviet accounts ==
Soviet historiography was under central control and blamed the West for the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel H. Baron, and Nancy W. Heer, eds. "The Soviet Union: Historiography since Stalin," in Georg Iggers and Harold Parker, eds. ''International handbook of historical studies: contemporary research and theory'' (1979) pp 281-94&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the historian [[E. H. Carr#Cold War|E. H. Carr]] wrote a 14-volume [[history of the Soviet Union]], which was focused on the 1920s and published 1950–1978. His friend R. W. Davies said Carr belonged to the anti-Cold-War school of history, which regarded the Soviet Union as the major progressive force in the world, the United States as the world's principal obstacle to the advancement of humanity and the Cold War as a case of American aggression against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Davies. "'Drop the Glass Industry': Collaborating with E.H. Carr" ''New Left Review'', Issue # 145, May–June 1984 pp. 56–70 quote on p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillel Ticktin, "Carr, the Cold War, and the Soviet Union" in Michael Cox, ed., ''E.H. Carr: A Critical Appraisal'' (2000) pp. 145–161. {{ISBN|978-0-333-72066-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carr criticized those Anglophone historians, who he felt had unfairly judged the Soviet Union by the cultural norms of Britain and the United States.&lt;ref name="Laqueur 1987 115"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1987|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthodox accounts ==
The first school of interpretation to emerge in the United States was "orthodox". For more than a decade after the end of the World War II, few American historians challenged the official American interpretation of the beginnings of the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Brinkley 1986 798_799"/&gt; The "orthodox" school places the responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its [[Eastern Bloc|expansion into Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name ="Calhoun"&gt;{{Harvnb|Calhoun|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Thomas A. Bailey]] argued in his 1950 ''America Faces Russia'' that the breakdown of postwar peace was the result of [[Soviet Empire|Soviet expansionism]] in the immediate years following World War II. Bailey argued [[Joseph Stalin]] violated promises he had made at the [[Yalta Conference]], imposed Soviet-dominated regimes on unwilling Eastern European populations and conspired to spread communism throughout the world.&lt;ref name = "Brinkley 1986 798_799" /&gt; From that view, American officials were forced to respond to Soviet aggression with the [[Truman Doctrine]], plans to contain communist subversion around the world and the [[Marshall Plan]].

Another prominent "orthodox" historian was [[Herbert Feis]], who in his works like ''Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin'' and ''From Trust to Terror: The Onset of the Cold War'' stated similar views. According to him, Soviet aggression in Eastern Europe in the postwar period was responsible for starting of the Cold War. Apart from this, he also argued that [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s policies towards Stalin and his "surrender" to Stalin's demands in the Yalta Conference paved the way for Soviet aggression and destabilized balance of power in Europe in Soviet favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Feis|1957}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation has been described as the "official" United States version of Cold War history.&lt;ref name="Calhoun"/&gt; Although it lost its dominance as a mode of historical thought in academic discussions in 1960s, it continues to be influential.&lt;ref name="Nashel"/&gt;

== Revisionism ==
[[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|United States involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s]] disillusioned [[New Left]] historians and created a minority of historians with sympathy towards the [[Viet Cong]] communist position and antipathy towards American policies.

Much more important were the revisionists who argued that both United States and the Soviet Union were responsible for blundering into the war and rejected the premises of "containment". They battled the "orthodox" historians.&lt;ref name="Brinkley 1986 798_799"/&gt; "[[Historical revisionism|Revisionist]]" accounts emerged in the wake of the [[Vietnam War]] in the context of a larger rethinking of the United States role in international affairs, which was seen more in terms of [[American imperialism|American empire]] or [[hegemony]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun"/&gt;

While the new school of thought spanned many differences among individual scholars, the works comprising it were generally responses in one way or another to [[William Appleman Williams]] 1959 volume, ''The Tragedy of American Diplomacy''. Williams challenged the long-held assumptions of "orthodox" accounts, arguing that Americans had always been an empire-building people even while American leaders denied it.&lt;ref name="Nashel"/&gt;  The influence of Williams, who taught at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], and several of his students who subsequently published works on these themes, was enough to create what became known as the [[Wisconsin School (diplomatic history)|"Wisconsin School" of American diplomatic history]].&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book | title=American Foreign Relations Reconsidered: 1890–1993 | editor-first=Gordon | editor-last=Martel | publisher=Routledge | date=1994 | location=London  | chapter= Economic interest and United States foreign policy | first=Emily S. | last=Rosenberg | pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wisconsin School was distinct from the New Left; while members of each found themselves allied at times, New Left critiques tended to be a good deal more radical both in analysis and in proposed solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=James G. | last=Morgan | title=Into New Territory: American Historians and the Concept of American Imperialism | location= Madison | publisher= University of Wisconsin Press | date=2014 | pages=172–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Following Williams, revisionists placed more responsibility for the breakdown of postwar peace on the United States, citing a range of their efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II.&lt;ref name="Calhoun"/&gt; They argued that American policymakers shared an overarching concern with maintaining the market system and capitalist democracy. To achieve that objective, they pursued an "[[free trade#Present day (US based)|open door]]" policy abroad, aimed at increasing access to foreign markets for American business and agriculture.&lt;ref name="Nashel"/&gt;

Revisionist scholars challenged the widely accepted scholarly research that [[Soviet leaders]] were committed to postwar expansion of communism. They cited evidence that the Soviet Union's occupation of Eastern Europe had a defensive rationale and that Soviet leaders saw themselves as attempting to avoid encirclement by the United States and its allies.&lt;ref name="Calhoun"/&gt; In that view, the Soviet Union was so weak and devastated after the end of the World War II to be unable to pose any serious threat to the United States, who maintained a nuclear monopoly until the [[Soviet atomic bomb project|Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb]] in August 1949.&lt;ref name="Brinkley 1986 798_799"/&gt;

Revisionist historians have also presented the view that the origins of the Cold War date to the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Nashel"/&gt; Some reach back even further as Wisconsin School historian [[Walter LaFeber]] in his study ''America, Russia, and the Cold War'', first published in 1972, argued that the Cold War had its origins in 19th century conflicts between Russia and the United States over the opening of East Asia to American trade, markets and influence.&lt;ref name="Nashel"/&gt; LaFeber argued that the United States commitment at the close of World War II to ensuring a world in which every state was open to American influence and trade, underpinned many of the conflicts that triggered the beginning of the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Brinkley 1986 798_799"/&gt;

Starting with [[Gar Alperovitz]] in his influential ''Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam'' (1965), revisionists have focused on the United States decision to use atomic weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the last days of World War II.&lt;ref name="Brinkley 1986 798_799"/&gt;  In their belief, the [[nuclear bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima]] in effect started the Cold War. According to Alperovitz, the bombs were used not against an already-defeated Japan to win the war, but to intimidate the Soviets by signaling that the United States would use nuclear weapons to stop Soviet expansion, though they failed to do so.&lt;ref name="Nashel"/&gt;

New Left historians Joyce and [[Gabriel Kolko]]'s ''The Limits of Power: The World and U.S. Foreign Policy, 1945–1954'' (1972) has also received considerable attention in the historiography on the Cold War. The Kolkos argued American policy was both reflexively [[Anticommunism|anticommunist]] and counterrevolutionary. The United States was fighting not necessarily Soviet influence, but also any form of challenge to the American economic and political prerogatives through covert or military means.&lt;ref name="Nashel"/&gt; In this sense, the Cold War is less a story of rivalry between two blocs, but more a story of the ways by which the dominant states within each bloc controlled and disciplined their own populations and clients and about who supported and stood to benefit from increased arms production and political anxiety over a perceived external enemy.&lt;ref name = "Halliday"/&gt;

== Post-revisionism ==
The revisionist interpretation produced a critical reaction of its own. In a variety of ways, "post-revisionist" scholarship before the [[fall of Communism]] challenged earlier works on the origins and course of the Cold War.
 
During the period, "post-revisionism" challenged the "revisionists" by accepting some of their findings, but rejecting most of their key claims.&lt;ref name="Brinkley 1986 798_799"/&gt; Another current attempt to strike a balance between the "orthodox" and "revisionist" camps, identifying areas of responsibility for the origins of the conflict on both sides.&lt;ref name="Brinkley 1986 798_799"/&gt; For example, Thomas G. Paterson in ''Soviet-American Confrontation'' (1973) viewed Soviet hostility and United States efforts to dominate the postwar world as equally responsible for the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Brinkley 1986 798_799"/&gt;

The seminal work of this approach was [[John Lewis Gaddis]]'s ''The United States and the Origins of the Cold War, 1941–1947'' (1972). The account was immediately hailed as the beginning of a new school of thought on the Cold War claiming to synthesize a variety of interpretations.&lt;ref name="Nashel"/&gt; Gaddis then maintained that "neither side can bear sole responsibility for the onset of the Cold War".&lt;ref name="Brinkley 1986 798_799"/&gt; However, he emphasized the constraints imposed on United States policymakers by the complications of domestic politics.&lt;ref name="Brinkley 1986 798_799"/&gt; In addition, Gaddis has criticized some revisionist scholars, particularly Williams, for failing to understand the role of Soviet policy in the origins of the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Nashel"/&gt; Gaddis's 1983 distillation&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of post-revisionist scholarship became a major channel for guiding subsequent Cold War research.&lt;ref name = "Hogan 1987 494"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hogan|1987|p=494}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An almost immediate move to challenge Gaddis' framework came from [[Melvyn P. Leffler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|1984a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who "demonstrated that it was not so much the actions of the Kremlin as it was fears about socioeconomic dislocation, revolutionary nationalism, British weakness, and Eurasian vacuums of power that triggered US initiatives to mold an international system to comport with its concept of security".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|Painter|2005|pp=15–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That provoked "strong rebuttals"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|Painter|2005|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from Gaddis and his followers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|Kuniholm|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but Leffler deemed their objections inaccurate and unsubstantiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|1984b|p=391}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Leffler himself still falls within the overall post-revisionist camp.&lt;ref name="vcdh.virginia.edu"&gt;[http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/solguide/VUS12/essay12b.html "The Origins of the Cold War" Seth Center, University of Virginia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qiwSVl169XYC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=lewis+gaddis,+orthodox&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m5s9Uyh_YU&amp;sig=TJP3YacCj3MxhW_PMrquuHsOONk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj80bfl_KPYAhUKQt8KHUxCAmU4ChDoAQhDMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=lewis%20gaddis%2C%20orthodox&amp;f=false ''America in the World: The Historiography of US Foreign Relations Since 1941'', edited by Michael J. Hogan (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the "post-revisionist" literature emerged a new area of inquiry that was more sensitive to nuance and interested less in the question of who started the conflict than in offering insight into United States and Soviet actions and perspectives.&lt;ref name="Calhoun"/&gt; From that perspective, the Cold War was not so much the responsibility of either side, but rather the result of predictable tensions between two world powers that had been suspicious of one another for nearly a century. For example, Ernest May wrote in a 1984 essay: {{quote|After the Second World War, the United States and the Soviet Union were doomed to be antagonists. [...] There probably was never any real possibility that the post-1945 relationship could be anything but hostility verging on conflict. [...] Traditions, belief systems, propinquity, and convenience [...] all combined to stimulate antagonism, and almost no factor operated in either country to hold it back.&lt;ref name = "Brinkley 1986 799"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brinkley|1986|p=799}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From that view of "post-revisionism" emerged a line of inquiry that examines how Cold War actors perceived various events and the degree of misperception involved in the failure of the two sides to reach common understandings of their wartime alliance and their disputes.&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt;

After the opening of the [[Soviet archives]], John Lewis Gaddis began to argue that the Soviets should be held more accountable for conflict. According to Gaddis, Stalin was in a much better position to compromise than his Western counterparts, given his much broader power within his own regime than Truman, who was often undermined by vociferous political opposition at home. Asking if it would have been possible to predict that the wartime alliance would fall apart within a matter of months, leaving in its place nearly a half century of cold war, Gaddis wrote in his 1997 book ''We Now Know: Rethinking Cold War History'' the following: {{quote|Geography, demography, and tradition contributed to this outcome but did not determine it. It took men, responding unpredictably to circumstances, to forge the chain of causation; and it took [Stalin] in particular, responding predictably to his own authoritarian, paranoid, and narcissistic predisposition, to lock it into place.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1997|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Leffler, the most distinctive feature of ''We Now Know'' is the extent to which Gaddis "abandons post-revisionism and returns to a more traditional interpretation of the Cold War".&lt;ref name = "Leffler 1999 503"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|1999|p=503}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddis is now widely seen as more "orthodox" than "post-revisionist".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qiwSVl169XYC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=lewis+gaddis,+orthodox&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m5s9Uyh_YU&amp;sig=TJP3YacCj3MxhW_PMrquuHsOONk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj80bfl_KPYAhUKQt8KHUxCAmU4ChDoAQhDMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=lewis%20gaddis%2C%20orthodox&amp;f=false ''America in the World: The Historiography of US Foreign Relations Since 1941'', edited by Michael J.

=== 21st century scholarship ===
Since the 2000s, benefiting largely from the opening of Cold War-era archives in the Soviet Union and elsewhere in the world, Cold War historians have begun to move on from questions of blame and inevitability to consider the Cold War in the ''[[longue durée]]'' of the 20th century, alongside questions of culture, technology and ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mastny|1996|pp=3–4}}: "nw the fight is over, the old inquiry about who started the Cold War is less interesting than the new one about why it ended the way it did. Less constrained to apportion the blame, we can be more relaxed in narrating a fascinating story.... In looking at the Cold War as history, much of the distinction between the 'orthodox' and the 'revisionist' schools... has become blurred."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Westad CHOCW"&gt;{{Harvnb|Westad|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have also begun to consider the Cold War from a variety of international perspectives (non-American and non-Soviet) and most especially have stressed the importance of what was then called the "[[Third World]]" in the latter half of the Cold War.&lt;ref name ="Westad CHOCW"/&gt; As Odd Arne Westad, co-editor of the ''Cambridge History of the Cold War'' (2010) has written: {{quote|Very few of our contributors believe that a "definitive" history of the Cold War is possible (or indeed that it should be possible). But a heterogeneous approach creates a strong need for contextualization.... First and foremost we need to situate the Cold War within the wider history of the twentieth century in a global perspective. We need to indicate how Cold War conflicts connect to broader trends in social, economic, and intellectual history as well as to the political and military developments of the longer term of which it forms a part.&lt;ref name="Westad CHOCW"/&gt;}}

After 1990s new memoirs and archival materials have opened up the study of espionage and intelligence during the Cold War. Scholars are reviewing how its origins, its course, and its outcome were shaped by the intelligence activities of the United States, the Soviet Union, and other key countries.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond L.

Hopkins, "Continuing debate and new approaches in Cold War history." ''Historical Journal'' 50.4 (2007): 913-934.&lt;/ref&gt;  Special attention is paid to how complex images of one's adversaries were shaped by secret intelligence that is now publicly known.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Maddrell, ed.

'''International Film Festival Rotterdam''' ('''IFFR''') is an annual [[film festival]] held in various cinemas in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Rotterdam_International_Film_Festival/ Rotterdam_International_Film_Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028044709/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Rotterdam_International_Film_Festival/ |date=28 October 2007 }} imdb.com.&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of January. &lt;!--moved lion to history--&gt; Since its founding in 1972, it has become one of the most important events in the film world, maintaining its focus on independent and experimental filmmaking by emerging talents and established auteurs. The festival also has a unique focus on presenting cutting edge media art and artist's film, with most of the participants in the short film program identified as artists or experimental filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artslant.com/sp/articles/show/41809 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807081720/https://www.artslant.com/sp/articles/show/41809 |archivedate=7 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artforum.com/film/id=50043|title=Shorts Circuit|author=|date=|website=artforum.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807071507/https://www.artforum.com/film/id=50043|archivedate=7 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFFR also hosts CineMart, for film producers to seek funding.

== Festival ==
The International Film Festival Rotterdam management emphasizes diversity in its film programming and on building relationships with and between filmmakers and audiences.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Rather than red-carpet events, the festival's design is to encourage film makers to mingle with attendees. As a result, the festival claims having "a unique atmosphere" and a "fiercely loyal following" locally and internationally - around 90% of tickets are sold to regular supporters.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The festival is described as having "a serious commitment to film lovers and film making - screenings are shown without 'popcorn breaks', trailers or other commercials. This sense of purpose plays a crucial role in attracting the best directors to the event, allowing it to forge a reputation for diversity, discovery and innovation."{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== History ==
The first festival — then called 'Film International' — was organized in June 1972 under the leadership of [[Huub Bals]]. IFFR's logo is a [[tiger]], loosely based on the [[M.G.M.]] lion.&lt;ref&gt;Heijs, Jan Heijs &amp; Westra, Frans (1996). ''Que le tigre danse. Huub Bals a biography.'' Otto Cramwinckel: Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;  From the beginning, the festival has profiled itself as a promoter of alternative, innovative and non-commercial films, with an emphasis on the [[Far East]] and developing countries.  Around 1983, the festival founded CineMart to serve as a "regular film market," and later modified the business model to serve instead as a "co-production market",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/professionals/cinemine/cinemart_history/ "CineMart History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928053325/http://www.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/professionals/cinemine/cinemart_history/ |date=28 September 2011 }}. International Film Festival Rotterdam. Retrieved September 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mundell, Ian (January 13, 2009) [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998470?refCatId=3517 "CineMart thriving in tough times"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109053831/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998470?refCatId=3517 |date=9 November 2012 }}.

(December 17, 2010). [http://www.indiewire.com/article/rotterdams_cinemart_selects_33_projects_for_2011 "Rotterdam’s CineMart Selects 33 Projects for 2011"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222124556/http://www.indiewire.com/article/rotterdams_cinemart_selects_33_projects_for_2011 |date=22 February 2012 }}. [[IndieWire]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the festival founder's sudden death in 1988, a fund was initiated and named after him ([[Hubert Bals Fund]]), used for supporting filmmakers from developing countries.

The non-competitive character of the festival changed in 1995, when the ''[[VPRO]] Tiger Awards'' were introduced—three yearly prizes for young filmmakers making their first or second film. The next year, [[Simon Field]], formerly Cinema Director at the London [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], became director of the festival. In 2004 Sandra den Hamer took over as director of the festival, and from 2007 to 2015 the director was Ruger Wolfson. Since August 2015 the leadership is in the hands of film producer [[Bero Beyer]].  Despite financial difficulties in the mid-1980s, the festival has grown steadily, reaching more than 300,000 visitors in 2015.

An '''[[independence referendum]]''' was held in [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]] on 3 March 1991,&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1122 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside a similar referendum in the [[Estonian independence referendum, 1991|Republic of Estonia]]. Known as the "Popular Survey about the independence of the Republic of Latvia", voters were asked "are you in favour of a democratic and independent Republic of Latvia".&lt;ref name=DN&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1136&lt;/ref&gt; It was approved by 74.9% of voters, with a turnout of 87.6%.&lt;ref name=DN/&gt; Latvian Republic civilians registered in Soviet Army units also had the right to vote in this poll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=65213 LATVIJAS REPUBLIKAS AUGSTĀKĀS PADOMES LĒMUMS Par kārtību, kādā notiek Latvijas iedzīvotāju aptauja]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Burns announced his candidacy to replace retiring Republican [[Trey Gowdy]] in [[South Carolina's 4th congressional district]].&lt;ref name="Outspoken pro-Trump pastor Mark Burns jumps in race for Gowdy seat"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vitali|first1=Ali|title=Outspoken pro-Trump pastor Mark Burns jumps in race for Gowdy seat|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/outspoken-pro-trump-pastor-mark-burns-joins-race-gowdy-seat-n848516|website=NBC News|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burns is co-founder of the NOW Television Network.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thenownetwork.org/|title=The NOW Television Network|website=thenownetwork.org|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education==

Burns was born in [[Anderson, South Carolina]], on September 21, 1979, as John Mark Burns, to parents Otis and Debra Burns. At an early age, he began playing the keyboard and singing gospel music with his family group, the Burns Brothers of [[Belton, South Carolina]], traveling extensively around the country. In 1995, at the age of 16, Burns was licensed as a minister of the gospel under his father at the Mt. Pleasant Missionary Baptist Church, in [[Pelzer, South Carolina]]. While preaching, he attended [[Belton-Honea Path High School]] but did not receive his degree due to an unplanned pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pastor Mark Burns: From poverty to Trump supporter and now candidate for Congress |url=https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/pastor-mark-burns-from-poverty-to-trump-supporter-and-now/article_feb3ea24-1bf2-11e8-a58f-9be4263d24dc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would eventually get his [[General Educational Development|GED]] from the [[South Carolina Department of Education]] in 1998. Burns briefly attended [[Southern Wesleyan University]] and [[Tri-County Technical College]] before dropping out. He later attended [[North Greenville University]] for one semester before dropping out.&lt;ref name="morin2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Morin | first = Rebecca | title= Trump surrogate admits to falsifying biographical claims | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/pastor-mark-burns-admits-to-falsifying-biographical-claims-227709 | journal=[[Politico]] | date = September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 19, 2005, Burns was [[Ordination|ordained]] at Traveler's Rest Baptist Church, in [[Seneca, SC]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Burns claimed to have held a [[bachelor of science]] degree from [[North Greenville University]];&lt;ref name="CNN-Tatum"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sophie |last=Tatum |title=Trump surrogate admits falsifying biographical claims |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/03/politics/mark-burns-donald-trump-interview/index.html |work=CNN |date=2016-09-03 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; said he was a member of the historically African-American fraternity, [[Kappa Alpha Psi]];&lt;ref name="inquisitrburns"/&gt; and claimed to have served six years in the [[U.S. Army Reserve]].&lt;ref name="CNN-Tatum"/&gt; But in August 2016, those longstanding claims in his biography were disproved after [[CNN]] fact-checked them.&lt;ref name="CNN-Tatum"/&gt; North Greenville University told CNN that Burns attended the school for just one semester and did not receive a degree. Additionally, when questioned by CNN about his claimed participation in the Army Reserve, Burns, who had served in the [[South Carolina Army National Guard]], from 2001 to 2005, stated "the Army South Carolina National Guard is Reserves." However, CNN noted that the South Carolina National Guard is a completely separate organization, unrelated to the Army Reserve.&lt;ref name="CBS News"&gt;{{cite web |last=Flores |first=Reena |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pastor-mark-burns-donald-trump-supporter-overstated-biography-details/ |title=Pastor Mark Burns, Donald Trump supporter, "overstated" biography details |work=CBS News |date=September 3, 2016 |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned about his attendance at [[Andersonville Theological Seminary]], also mentioned in his biography, Burns was unable to clarify.&lt;ref name="blake2016"&gt;{{cite news|last = Blake | first = Aaron| title= Trump backer Mark Burns's painfully bad attempts to defend his inflated resume | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/03/trump-backer-mark-burnss-defenses-of-his-inflated-bio-are-painfully-painfully-bad | journal=[[Washington Post]] | date = September 3, 2016 |accessdate=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; His church's website also claimed he was a member of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], a national historically black fraternity.&lt;ref name="inquisitrburns"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/3479551/pastor-mark-burns-leaves-cnn-interview-trump-speaker-busted-over-kappa-alpha-psi-college-degree-and-army-claims-full-videol |title=Pastor Mark Burns Leaves CNN Interview: Trump Speaker Busted Over Kappa Alpha Psi, College Degree And Army Claims |last=Mooney |first=Noah |work=Inquisitr |date=September 3, 2016 |accessdate=September 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns responded that he had "started the process," but did not complete initiation. Burns also claimed about the website: "Obviously this has been manipulated or either hacked or added."&lt;ref name="blake2016"/&gt; Website host [[Wix.com]] however, responded that there was no evidence of a hack.&lt;ref name="CNN-Tatum"/&gt; Later he admitted that he had lied and had unacceptably exaggerated his education, but said he was attacked because he is "a black man supporting Donald Trump for president."&lt;ref name="morin2016"/&gt;

== Televangelism ==
Burns, along with his wife, Tomarra Burns, founded the NOW Television Network,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; a Christian television network based in South Carolina, on March 1, 2015. He is also executive producer and host of the ''Lift your Voice Show.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://watchimpact.com/portfolio/lift-every-voice-gospel-show/|work=The Impact Network|title=Lift Every Voice Gospel Show|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Trump rally in North Carolina, Burns said that Democratic presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]], who is [[Jewish]], "gotta get saved".&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt; Burns later addressed his statement and said he had not intended to criticize [[Judaism]] and that his remarks "had nothing to do with [Sanders'] faith or religion or conversion to [[Christianity]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/344148/pro-trump-pastor-backtracks-on-claim-that-bernie-sanders-gotta-meet-jesus/|title=Pro-Trump Pastor Backtracks on Claim That Bernie Sanders 'Gotta Meet Jesus'|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns offered the benediction on the first day of the [[2016 Republican National Convention]]. Before the prayer, he addressed the convention, called Trump a "man of God" and called on Republicans to not attack each other, labeling [[Hillary Clinton]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] the "enemy." Critics of the message, including the [[Interfaith Alliance]], accused Burns of inserting God into partisan politics. Later, he said "If I could go back and use different wording I wouldn't have said 'enemy,' I would have said, 'political opponents.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Barnett |first=Ron |url=http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article90986357.html |title=SC pastor Mark Burns' delivers benediction at Republican National Convention |work=The State |accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Burns was criticized after he retweeted a digitally manipulated image of Hillary Clinton in [[blackface]].

In March, Ecuador's foreign trade minister was forced to reject rumours that the pageant was at risk of being moved to [[People's Republic of China|China]], and he urged Ecuadoreans to back the pageant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister scolds Ecuadoreans for not being excited about Miss Universe |agency=Associated Press|date=2004-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an added incentive for tourists, American Airlines, official airline sponsor of the pageant, offered 5% off airfares to Quito for travel to the pageant, as well as 10% off for those who booked a month in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=American Airlines|date=2004-04-07|title=Enjoy the sights and sounds of the Miss Universe pageant in Ecuador thanks to discounts offered by American Airlines Take Advantage of a Bonus Discount When Booking the Trip 30 Days in Advance}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attempted use of the pageant to promote Ecuador threatened to be derailed just prior to the telecast, when a corruption scandal led to growing demands for the removal of President [[Lucio Gutierrez]] in the politically unstable country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ecuador looks to Miss Universe pageant to improve image tainted by political crisis|agency=Associated Press|first=Monty|last=Hayes|date=2004-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the arrival of delegates in early May, officials in Quito attempted to renovate areas where they would be visiting, which involved temporarily removing beggars and homeless people from certain areas of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quito primps for Miss Universe pageant by clearing out beggars|date=2004-05-12|publisher=EFE News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar action was taken in [[Bangkok, Thailand]] prior to [[Miss Universe 1992]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand Evicting the Poor: Coming Events Spur Leaders to Level Slum|publisher=Los Angeles Daily News|first=Philip|last=Shenon|date=1991-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] prior to [[Miss Universe 1994]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police roundup of Manila street children under probe |publisher=Straits Times|date=1994-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was protested by native Indian activists and environmentalists who accused the government of concealing the nations poverty whilst the pageant was being hosted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Activists say poor Ecuador no place for Miss Universe contest |publisher=EFE News Service|date=2004-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The delegates, judges, media and tourists were heavily protected by a security detail involving over 5000 police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ecuador to assign 5,250 police to safeguard Miss Universe pageant |date=2004-05-31|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May, just hours before delegates were expected to participate in a parade in Cuenca, a pamphlet bomb was deactivated by police.

The '''murder of Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie''', an exchange student from [[Ghana]], is alleged to have been carried out by Alexander Kinyua (born October 23, 1990 in [[Nairobi]]) in [[Joppatowne, Maryland|Joppatowne]], [[Maryland]], United States. Kinyua is alleged to have eaten Agyei-Kodies' organs in an act of [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/31/justice/maryland-alleged-cannibal/index.html Maryland alleged cannibal] Maryland student, 21, admits eating housemate's heart, part of brain June 1, 2012 CNN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57444848-504083/alexander-kinyua-21-arrested-for-murder-eating-body-parts-maryland-police-say/ Alexander Kinyua, 21, arrested for murder, eating body parts, Maryland police say] May 31, 2012 CBS News&lt;/ref&gt;
The killing came after Kinyua was released on bail following a separate brutal attack.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Brumfield [http://hosted2.ap.org/OHCOL/8ef5320729ce4298abefc1903704c7d5/Article_2012-06-05-Mutilated%20Body-Maryland/id-d0c8be1f74514c8c90e3b83662d741e8 Lawyer: Prior bat attack foreshadowed cannibalism] June 5 Associated Press (Columbus Dispatch)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Kinyua emigrated from Kenya to the United States as a child and became a U.S. citizen. At the time of the alleged murder and cannibalism, 21-year-old Kinyua was an engineering student at [[Morgan State University]], a university in nearby [[Baltimore]]. His father is a professor at the school.

Kinyua had posted nonsensical and bizarre writings on his Facebook page. For example, two days before Kinyua's arrest, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;HEAR ME OUT '''BUTCHERS''': ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH TO ENDURE RITUAL HBCU MASS HUMAN SACRIFICES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND STILL BE ABLE TO FUNCTION AS HUMAN BEINGS? IT'S BEEN ALL TOO TRAGIC WITH THE DUAL UNIVERSITY SHOOTINGS AT VIRGINIA TECH, AND OTHER PAST UNIVERSITY KILLINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

Kinyua's mother posted on her Facebook: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our son, Alexander Kimanthi Kinyua, was arrested on Saturday, May 19, for being involved in a fight in his dormitory room at Morgan State University. The charge against him is "1st Degree Assault and Excessive Endangerment of Life". His bail has been set for US $220,000.00. In order to get him the best defense possible, we need to secure an attorney who will take his case and leave no stone unturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57445667-504083/ |title=Alexander Kinyua, accused Md. cannibal, was on bail for another assault prior to his arrest, reports say – Crimesider |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2012-06-02 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Murder==
Agyei-Kodie was staying with the Kinyua family pending deportation to his home country due to non-compliance with the terms of his visa.  He had first met Antony Kinyua, the father of his alleged killer, while pursuing a doctoral degree at Morgan State University. On Friday, May 25, 2012, Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie was reported missing by Kinyua's father.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|author=Justin Fenton, Kayla Bawroski and Kevin Rector |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/cannibalism-alleged-in-killing-of-ghanian-former-masters-degree-student/2012/06/01/gJQAnu3F8U_story.html |title=Cannibalism alleged in killing of Ghanian former master's degree student |work=The Washington Post |date=May 23, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=06/01/2012 4:22 pm Updated: 06/01/2012 6:44 pm |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/01/alexander-kinyua-ate-kujoe-agyei-kodie-cannibalism-facebook-maryland_n_1563586.html#s=1047189 |title=Alexander Kinyua, Maryland Man Who Allegedly Ate Kujoe Agyei-Kodie, First Ranted on Facebook |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=2012-06-02 |date=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Police reported to the Kinyua residence on May 31 after being contacted by Kinyua's brother to report what looked like body parts in two tins in the basement.  Further remains were found in a skipside a church about a mile away. Alexander Kinyua was arrested and charged with first degree murder, along with first and second degree assault.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

'''Michelle Gardner-Quinn''' (January 28, 1985 &amp;ndash; October 2006) was an undergraduate at the [[University of Vermont]] who was kidnapped on October 7, 2006. Her body was later found along a road in the neighboring town of [[Richmond, Vermont|Richmond]] on October 13.

==Disappearance and murder==
In the early morning hours of October 7, Gardner-Quinn was walking home in [[Burlington, Vermont]] to her campus dormitory after a night out with friends. She borrowed a [[mobile phone|cell phone]] from a passerby, [[Brian L. Rooney|Brian Rooney]], to call an acquaintance. A jewelry store surveillance camera captured Gardner-Quinn walking east with Rooney at approximately 2:34 am. Six days later, her body was found by hikers near Huntington Gorge in Richmond, Vermont. An autopsy revealed she had been sexually assaulted, beaten and strangled.

==Assailant==
At a press conference on October 13, police announced that they had found Gardner-Quinn's body and arrested [[Brian L. Rooney|Brian Rooney]] on separate charges unrelated to the case.  Rooney, a construction worker with several prior arrests, is facing charges from neighboring [[Caledonia County, Vermont|Caledonia County]] that pertain to [[sexual assault]] and lewd conduct with a child. In addition to being the person who last saw Gardner-Quinn, Rooney was reportedly seen with cuts on his hands when he stopped at a business in [[Winooski, Vermont|Winooski]] several days later.  On October 25, police announced that they had charged Rooney with aggravated homicide in the death of Gardner-Quinn. He pled not guilty.

At a press meeting, Rooney's lawyer accidentally revealed confidential information about DNA evidence, which resulted in the trial going under lock-and-key.

On May 22, 2008, Brian Rooney was convicted of [[aggravated murder]] in Rutland, Vermont, by a 12-member jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Burlington Free Press|title=Guilty: Jury Convicts Rooney|url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080522/NEWS01/80522010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 17, 2008, Rooney was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of [[parole]]. Judge Michael Kupersmith admonished him, stating that: "You are the lowest of the low." Rooney expressed condolences to Quinn's family but maintained he is innocent.&lt;ref name=CNN1&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/10/17/student.killed.ap/index.html Judge berates student's killer, gives him life], CNN.com, October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/us/18brfs-005.html|title=Vermont: Student’s Killer Gets Life|last=Press|first=Associated|date=2008-10-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

[[File:Gardner-Quinn Plaque.JPG|thumb|left|"'''Michelle We love you'''"&lt;br&gt;Roadside plaque near where Michelle's body was found. Visitors leave tokens such as beads and flowers on the boulder.]]

''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine featured Gardner-Quinn's story, "The Murder of a Beautiful Girl", in its February 2007 issue.

A non-profit organization, Michelle's Earth Foundation (MEF) has been founded in her memory.  It is devoted to promoting youth involvement and awareness in environmentalism, about which Gardner-Quinn cared deeply.

Her parents are creating a scholarship in her name at UVM (WPTZ)

An essay she wrote (just days before her abduction) about her environmental beliefs was featured at Live Earth concerts in July 2007 and on an August 5 [[National Public Radio]] broadcast. [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12444698]

Her essay, "A Reverence For All Life", has also been published in the book, ''This I Believe II: More Personal Philosophies of Remarkable Men and Women''.

A '''natural monopoly''' is a [[monopoly]] in an industry in which high infrastructural costs and other [[barriers to entry]] relative to the size of the market give the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, an overwhelming advantage over potential [[competitor]]s. This frequently occurs in industries where [[capital cost]]s predominate, creating [[economies of scale]] that are large in relation to the size of the market; examples include [[Public utility|public utilities]] such as [[water services]] and [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey M. Perloff|Perloff, J]], 2012. Microeconomics, Pearson Education, England, p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural monopolies were discussed as a potential source of [[market failure]] by [[John Stuart Mill]], who advocated government regulation to make them serve the [[public good]].

Two different types of cost are important in [[microeconomics]]: '''[[marginal cost]]''', and '''[[fixed cost]]'''. The marginal cost is the cost to the company of serving one more customer. In an industry where a natural monopoly does not exist, the vast majority of industries, the marginal cost decreases with economies of scale, then increases as the company has growing pains (overworking its employees, bureaucracy, inefficiencies, etc.). Along with this, the average cost of its products decreases and increases. A natural monopoly has a very different cost structure. A natural monopoly has a high fixed cost for a product that does not depend on output, but its marginal cost of producing one more good is roughly constant, and small.

[[File:Natural monopoly.jpg|thumb|right|270px|A graphical explanation of the inefficiencies of having several competitors in a naturally monopolistic market.]]

All industries have costs associated with entering them. Often, a large portion of these costs is required for [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]]. Larger industries, like utilities, require enormous initial investment. This [[barrier to entry]] reduces the number of possible entrants into the industry regardless of the earning of the corporations within.  Natural monopolies arise where the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, has an overwhelming cost advantage over other actual or potential competitors; this tends to be the case in industries where fixed costs predominate, creating economies of scale that are large in relation to the size of the market, as is the case in water and electricity services. The fixed cost of constructing a competing transmission network is so high, and the marginal cost of transmission for the incumbent so low, that it effectively bars potential competitors from the monopolist's market, acting as a nearly insurmountable barrier to entry into the market place.

A firm with high fixed costs requires a large number of customers in order to have a meaningful return on investment. This is where economies of scale become important. Since each firm has large initial costs, as the firm gains market share and increases its output the fixed cost (what they initially invested) is divided among a larger number of customers. Therefore, in industries with large initial investment requirements, [[average total cost]] declines as output increases over a much larger range of output levels.

Companies that take advantage of economies of scale often run into problems of bureaucracy; these factors interact to produce an "ideal" size for a company, at which the company's average cost of production is minimized. If that ideal size is large enough to supply the whole market, then that market is a natural monopoly.

Once a natural monopoly has been established because of the large initial cost and that, according to the rule of economies of scale, the larger corporation (to a point) has lower average cost and therefore a huge advantage. With this knowledge, no firms attempt to enter the industry and an [[oligopoly]] or monopoly develops.

=== Formal definition ===
William Baumol (1977)&lt;ref&gt;Baumol, William J., 1977. "On the Proper Cost Tests for Natural Monopoly in a Multiproduct Industry", ''American Economic Review'' 67, 809–22.&lt;/ref&gt; provided the current formal definition of a natural monopoly where "[a]n industry in which multi-firm production is more costly than production by a monopoly" (p.&amp;nbsp;810). He linked the definition to the mathematical concept of [[subadditivity]]; specifically of the cost function. Baumol also noted that for a firm producing a single
product, scale economies were a sufficient but not a necessary condition to prove subadditivity.

== History ==
{{Competition law}}
The original concept of natural monopoly is often attributed to [[John Stuart Mill]], who (writing before the [[marginalist revolution]]) believed that prices would reflect the costs of production in absence of an artificial or natural monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'', Book IV 'Influence of the progress of society on production and distribution', Chapter 2 'Influence of the Progress of Industry and Population on Values and Prices', para. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' Mill criticised Smith's neglect&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) Book I, Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; of an area that could explain wage disparity. Taking up the examples of professionals such as jewellers, physicians and lawyers, he said,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' Book II, Chapter XIV 'Of the Differences of Wages in different Employments', para. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition, but of its absence: not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment, but an extra advantage; a kind of monopoly price, the effect not of a legal, but of what has been termed a natural monopoly... independently of... artificial monopolies [i.e. grants by government], there is a natural monopoly in favour of skilled labourers against the unskilled, which makes the difference of reward exceed, sometimes in a manifold proportion, what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages. If unskilled labourers had it in their power to compete with skilled, by merely taking the trouble of learning the trade, the difference of wages might not exceed what would compensate them for that trouble, at the ordinary rate at which labour is remunerated. But the fact that a course of instruction is required, of even a low degree of costliness, or that the labourer must be maintained for a considerable time from other sources, suffices everywhere to exclude the great body of the labouring people from the possibility of any such competition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So Mill's initial use of the term concerned natural abilities, in contrast to the common contemporary usage, which refers solely to market failure in a particular type of industry, such as rail, post or electricity. Mill's development of the idea is that what is true of labour is true of capital.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' Book II, Chapter XV, 'Of Profits', para. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;All the natural monopolies (meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances, and not by law) which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labour, operate similarly between different employments of capital. If a business can only be advantageously carried on by a large capital, this in most countries limits so narrowly the class of persons who can enter into the employment, that they are enabled to keep their [[rate of profit]] above the general level. A trade may also, from the nature of the case, be confined to so few hands, that profits may admit of being kept up by a combination among the dealers. It is well known that even among so numerous a body as the London booksellers, this sort of combination long continued to exist. I have already mentioned the case of the gas and water companies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mill also applied the term to land, which can manifest a natural monopoly by virtue of it being the only land with a particular mineral, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'', Book II, Chapter XVI, "Of Rent", para. 2 and 16&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Mill referred to network industries, such as electricity and water supply, roads, rail and canals, as "practical monopolies", where "it is the part of the government, either to subject the business to reasonable conditions for the general advantage, or to retain such power over it, that the profits of the monopoly may at least be obtained for the public."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'', Book V, 'Of the Grounds and Limits of the Laisser-faire or Non-Interference Principle'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On subways, see also, {{cite book |last=McEachern |first=Willam A. |title=Economics: A Contemporary Introduction |publisher=Thomson South-Western |year=2005 |page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, a legal prohibition against competition is often advocated and rates are not left to the market but are regulated by the government.

For a discussion of the historical origins of the term 'natural monopoly' see Mosca.&lt;ref&gt;Mosca, M. 2008. On the origins of the concept of natural monopoly, The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought, 45 (2), 317-353.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
As with all monopolies, a monopolist which has gained its position through natural monopoly effects may engage in behaviour that abuses its market position, which often leads to calls from consumers for government [[regulation]]. Government regulation may also come about at the request of a business hoping to enter a market otherwise dominated by a natural monopoly.

Common arguments in favour of regulation include the desire to limit a company's potentially abusive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jsf.13.4.105|title=Regulating the Abuse of the Natural Monopoly of Pipelines in the Gas Industry vis-à-vis the Provision of Third Party Access|first=Balkisu|last=Saidu|date=8 May 2009|publisher=|volume=13|issue=4|pages=105–112|doi=10.3905/jsf.13.4.105}}&lt;/ref&gt; or unfair market power, facilitate competition, promote investment or system expansion, or stabilise markets. This is especially true in the case of essential utilities like electricity where a monopoly creates a [[captive market]] for a product few can refuse. In general, though, regulation occurs when the government believes that the operator, left to his own devices, would behave in a way that is contrary to the [[public interest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socc.edu/faculty/blocker/pgs/bm~doc/chapter-29-slides.ppt Natural Monopoly]{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries an early solution to this perceived problem was government provision of, for example, a utility service.  Allowing the monopolist the ability to change prices without regulation can have devastating effects in a society as displayed in Bolivia’s [[War over Water (Bolivia)|2000 Cochabamba protests]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Across the world [[Public utilities]] are widely used to provide state-run water, electricity, gas, telecommunications, mass-transportation and postal services. A wave of nationalisation across Europe after World War II created [[State-owned enterprise|state-owned companies]] in each of these areas, many of which operate internationally bidding on utility contracts in other countries.

However, this approach can raise its own problems. Some governments used the state-provided utility services as a source of cash flow for funding other{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} government activities, or as a means of obtaining hard [[currency]]. As a result,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} governments began to seek other solutions, namely regulation and providing services on a commercial basis, often through private participation.&lt;ref name="bokir"&gt;[http://www.regulationbodyofknowledge.org/general-concepts/ Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation] "General Concepts : Introduction."&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives to a state-owned response to natural-monopolies include both [[Open-source license|open source]] licensed technology and [[co-operatives]] management where a monopoly's users or workers own the monopoly. For instance, the web's open source architecture has both stimulated massive growth and avoided a single company controlling the entire market. The [[Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation]] is an American co-op which provides the majority of clearing and financial settlement across the securities industry ensuring they cannot abuse their market position to raise costs. In recent years a combined cooperative and open-source alternative to emergent web monopolies has been proposed, a [[Platform coop]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://platformcoop.net/platform-cooperativism-by-trebor-scholz]{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, for instance, [[Uber]] could be a driver-owned cooperative developing and sharing open-source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://helloideas.com/ideas/what-might-coop-uber-look-or-should-we-be-thinking-bigger|title=What might a Coop Uber look like?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11394">'''''Open Casket''''' is a 2016 painting by [[Dana Schutz]]. It is a portrait of [[Emmett Till]], a black 14-year-old boy who was [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] by two white men in [[Mississippi]] in 1955. It was one of the works included at the ''[[Whitney Biennial]]'' exhibition in New York in 2017. The painting caused considerable controversy, with protests and calls for the painting's destruction.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Randy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/arts/design/painting-of-emmett-till-at-whitney-biennial-draws-protests.html |title=White Artist’s Painting of Emmett Till at Whitney Biennial Draws Protests |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2017-03-21 |accessdate=2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and concept==
Dana Schutz created the painting in August 2016 in response to media coverage of gun violence, in particular, black men being shot by police.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite news |last3=Boucher |first3=Brian |url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/dana-schutz-responds-to-the-uproar-over-her-emmett-till-painting-900674 |title=Dana Schutz Responds to the Uproar Over Her Emmett Till Painting at the Whitney Biennial |work=[[Artnet]] |date=2017-03-23 |accessdate=2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The portrait is based, in part, on a photograph of Till's mutilated  body—his mother had insisted his casket remain open at his funeral to raise awareness of the graphic realities of racism in the U.S.—which was published in ''[[The Chicago Defender]]'' and ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/emmett-till-507515#trial |title=Emmett Till |work=[[Biography (TV series)]] |accessdate=2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The photograph of Emmett Till felt analogous to the time: what was hidden was now revealed," Schutz told [[Artnet]].  

The painting was first exhibited in Schutz's fall 2016 solo exhibition, "Waiting for the Barbarians," at Contemporary Fine Arts, Berlin.&lt;ref name=TZK&gt;{{cite news |title=Hannah Magauer on Dana Schutz at CFA, Berling Post-Private Getaways |url=https://www.textezurkunst.de/articles/magauer-schutz-cfa-de/ |work=Texte Zur Kunst |date=2017-01-19 |accessdate=2017-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, ''Open Casket'' was one of three of Schutz's paintings selected for inclusion in the 2017 Whitney Biennial.&lt;ref name="new yorker"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tomkins |first=Calvin |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/10/why-dana-schutz-painted-emmett-till |title=Why Dana Schutz Painted Emmett Till |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2017-04-10 |accessdate=2017-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the painting in a profile on Schutz for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', critic [[Calvin Tomkins]] wrote, "Measuring thirty-nine by fifty-three inches, it is smaller than most of her recent paintings, and more abstract. The buildup of paint on the face is a couple of inches thick in the area where Till’s mouth would be. Although there are no recognizable features, a deep trough carved into the heavy impasto conveys a sense of savage disfigurement, which is heightened by the whiteness of the boy’s smoothly ironed dress shirt. His head rests on an ochre-yellow fabric, and deftly brushed colors at the top suggest banked flowers."&lt;ref name="new yorker"/&gt;

==Response==
Soon after the opening of the 2017 Whitney Biennial, African-American artist Parker Bright began to silently protest ''Open Casket'' by standing in front of the painting wearing a T-shirt with "Black Death Spectacle" on the back.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; [[United Kingdom|UK-born]], [[Berlin|Berlin-based]] artist and writer [[Hannah Black]] wrote a letter to the museum's curators&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; demanding both the painting's removal and destruction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am writing to ask you to remove Dana Schutz's painting Open Casket with the urgent recommendation that the painting be destroyed and not entered into any market or museum. As you know, this painting depicts the dead body of 14-year-old Emmett Till in the open casket that his mother chose, saying, 'Let the people see what I’ve seen.' That even the disfigured corpse of a child was not sufficient to move the white gaze from its habitual cold calculation is evident daily and in a myriad of ways, not least the fact that this painting exists at all. In brief: The painting should not be acceptable to anyone who cares or pretends to care about Black people because it is not acceptable for a white person to transmute Black suffering into profit and fun..."&lt;ref name="george-baker"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.textezurkunst.de/articles/baker-pachyderm/ |title=George Baker on Painting, Critique, and Empathy in the Emmett Till/Whitney Biennial Debate |work=Texte Zur Kunst |date=2017-03-29 |accessdate=2017-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These actions led to a conversation in the media on [[cultural appropriation]] by white artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whitney-biennial-emmett-till_us_58d118b9e4b0be71dcf7cee8?te=Spin |title=White Artist’s Emmett Till Painting Incites Anger At Whitney Biennial |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=2017-03-21 |accessdate=2017-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Schutz responded through comments to reporters about how and why the painting was made:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I don’t know what it is like to be black in America but I do know what it is like to be a mother. Emmett was Mamie Till’s only son. The thought of anything happening to your child is beyond comprehension. Their pain is your pain. My engagement with this image was through empathy with his mother. [. . .] Art can be a space for empathy, a vehicle for connection. I don’t believe that people can ever really know what it is like to be someone else (I will never know the fear that black parents may have) but neither are we all completely unknowable."&lt;ref name="george-baker"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the relationship between her painting and the photograph of Till, Schutz reportedly said, "The photograph of him in his casket is almost impossible to look at. In making the painting, I relied more on listening to Mamie Till's verbal account of seeing her son, which oscillates between memory and observation."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Schutz has also commented "The painting is very different from the photograph. I could never render the photograph ethically or emotionally."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

Co-curator of the Whitney Biennial containing the painting, Mia Locks, said in defense of the painting's inclusion, "Right now I think there are a lot of sensitivities not just to race but to questions of identities in general. We welcome these responses. We invited these conversations intentionally in the way that we thought about the show." She added that the inclusion of the painting in the Whitney show was a way of "not letting Till’s death be forgotten, as Mamie, his mother so wanted."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

"The subject matter is not Schutz’s," [[Hannah Black]] wrote, in a petition targeting the painting.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; "White free speech and white creative freedom have been founded on the constraint of others, and are not natural rights. The painting must go." She added that "contemporary art is a fundamentally white supremacist institution despite all our nice friends."

In an interview in [[Artnet]] Schutz is asked "Could you have foreseen that you were stepping on a third rail by treating this explosive subject? If so, what made it necessary to paint Emmett Till specifically?" Schutz responded "Yes, for many reasons. The anger surrounding this painting is real and I understand that. It’s a problematic painting and I knew that getting into it. I do think that it is better to try to engage something extremely uncomfortable, maybe impossible, and fail, than to not respond at all."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

Lisa Whittington, a black woman who has also painted pictures on Emmett Till told [[NBC News]] "Art takes courage. It takes courage to create it, to show it, and to listen to people talk about your work. While I appreciate Dana Shutz's courage, and attempt to understand — for me, her understanding is not deep enough and careless. The horror was too gentle in her work. She fell short and did not tell a complete story. She downplayed the details and the emotion his death represented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Whittington |first=Lisa |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/museumssowhite-representation-black-pain-why-emmett-till-painting-matters-n737931 |title=#MuseumsSoWhite: Black Pain and Why Painting Emmett Till Matters |work=NBC News |date=2017-03-26 |accessdate=2017-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian [[George Baker (art historian)|George Baker]] wrote "We may want to believe that empathy has no restrictions but it does have limits. Schutz’s painting, 'Open Casket,' is naive, like most of the artist's work. Not just in its painterly style but in its gesture, its 'logic.' But naiveté edges into something much more sinister here, as the work collapses the destruction of Till's body and face, his murder, with the artist's own aesthetic. This is more narcissism than empathy. (Painting is not good at empathy; one of its founding myths, as Caravaggio long ago reminded us, of course is precisely the myth of Narcissus – the myth of boundless self-love, the myth as well of what Lacan would have called 'mis-recognition.')"&lt;ref name="george-baker"/&gt;

An open letter purportedly from artist Dana Schutz declaring her desire to remove the painting from exhibition was subsequently proven to be a hoax&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/dana-schutz-asks-whitney-remove-controversial-emmett-till-painting-901001&lt;/ref&gt;, and ''The New Yorker'' reported that "the museum has been fully supportive of the curators and the artist, and the painting will remain on view throughout the exhibit"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/10/why-dana-schutz-painted-emmett-till&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the calls to destroy the art were clearly rhetorical, and the protest inside the museum petered out a day or two after the show opened."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/does-an-offensive-sculpture-deserve-to-be-burned&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the painting and the surrounding issues were discussed on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Analysis (radio programme)|Analysis]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC Radio 4 Analysis"&gt;{{cite episode| title= Offence, Power and Progress | series= [[Analysis (radio programme)|Analysis]] | credits= Producer: Tim Mansel | network= BBC| station= [[BBC Radio 4]]| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09fy1qp | airdate= 20 November 2017| minutes= 17:45| accessdate= 20 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open House Chicago (OHC)''' is a free weekend festival held annually  in [[Chicago]] that allows participants to visit dozens of buildings that are not typically open to the public. It is currently being held October 13-14, 2018.

OHC is organized by the [[Chicago Architecture Foundation]] over a two-day period each year in mid-October. The event promotes appreciation of [[architecture]] by the general public.

OHC began in 2011 and it is part of a worldwide network of [[Doors Open Days|Open House]] events that started with [[Open House London]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openhouseworldwide.org/|title=Open House Worldwide|first=Jason Badrock/Alastair|last=Cassels|website=Openhouseworldwide.org|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its organizers state that event objectives include enabling participants to “venture into new neighborhoods, learn the stories of Chicago’s architecture and experience the diversity and culture of each community.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openhousechicago.org/about|title=About|website=Open House Chicago|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; OHC is an important event for [[tourism in Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choosechicago.com/articles/view/OPEN-HOUSE-CHICAGO/407/|title=Open House Chicago - Events - Choose Chicago|website=Choosechicago.com|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the event comes from the Chicago Architecture Center and from corporate sponsors, government agencies, foundations, and individual donors. The event relies on approximately 2,600 volunteers to staff participating buildings.

The '''pangolin trade''' is the illegal [[poaching]], [[wildlife smuggling|trafficking]], and sale of [[pangolin]]s, parts of pangolins, or pangolin-derived products. Pangolins are believed to be the world's most trafficked mammal, other than humans, accounting for as much as 20% of all illegal wildlife trade.&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph1january2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap5october2016/&gt; According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), more than a million pangolins were poached in the decade prior to 2014.&lt;ref name=iucnextinction/&gt;

The animals are trafficked mainly for their scales, which are believed to treat a variety of health conditions in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], and as a luxury food in Vietnam and China.

The [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES), which regulates the international wildlife trade, has placed restrictions on the pangolin market since 1975, and in 2016, it added all eight pangolin species to its Appendix I, reserved for the strictest prohibitions on animals threatened with extinction.&lt;ref name=guardian28september2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=citeshow/&gt; They are also listed on the [[IUCN Red List]], all with decreasing populations and designations ranging from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

==Background==

[[File:Coat of Pangolin scales.JPG|thumb|upright|A coat made with ''[[Indian pangolin|Manis crassicaudata]]'' scales on display at the [[Royal Armouries]] in Leeds. The coat was given to [[King George III]] in 1820, along with a helmet, also made with pangolin scales.]]

[[Pangolin]]s are [[mammal]]s of the order [[Pholidota]], of which there is one extant family, [[Manidae]], with three genera: ''[[Manis]]'' includes four species in Asia, and ''[[Phataginus]]'' and ''[[Smutsia]]'' each comprise two species in Africa. They are the only mammal known to have a layer of large, protective [[keratin]] scales covering their skin. Though sometimes known by the common name "scaly anteater," and formerly considered to be in the same order as [[anteater]]s, they are taxonomically distant, grouped with [[Carnivora]] under the clade [[Ferae]].

Pangolin behavior varies by species, with some living on the ground, in underground burrows, and some living in trees. A common predator, [[big cat]]s, struggle to contend with pangolins' scales when rolled up. But while well-equipped to defend against natural predators, they are easily caught by poachers, who simply pick up the animals when they roll into a ball.&lt;ref name=telegraph1january2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian28september2016/&gt;

All eight species of pangolin are listed on the [[IUCN Red List]], with designations ranging from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; According to the IUCN and other scientists and activists, the populations of all species are rapidly decreasing.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt; 

==History==

The pangolin trade is centuries old. An early known example is in 1820, when [[Francis Rawdon]], 1st Marquis of Hastinges and [[British East India Company|East India Company]] Governor General in Bengal, presented [[King George III]] with a coat and helmet made with the scales of ''Manis crassicaudata''.&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015/&gt; The gifts are now stored in the Royal Armouries in Leeds.

The [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES), which regulates the international wildlife trade, added the eight known species of pangolin to its appendices in 1975. CITES places species it seeks to protect in three appendices organized according to urgency and, correspondingly, the strictness of the regulations. Appendix I includes the strictest prohibitions and is reserved for animals threatened with extinction.&lt;ref name=citeshow/&gt; In 1975, ''[[Ground pangolin|Smutsia temminckii]]'' was placed in Appendix I; ''[[Indian pangolin|Manis crassicaudata]]'', ''[[Philippine pangolin|Manis culionensis]]'', ''[[Sunda pangolin|Manis javanica]]'', and ''[[Chinese pangolin|Manis pentadactyla]]'' were placed in Appendix II; ''[[Giant pangolin|Smutsia gigantea]]'', ''[[Long-tailed pangolin|Phataginus tetradactyla]]'', and ''[[Tree pangolin|Phataginus tricuspis]]'' were placed in Appendix III.&lt;ref name=citeschecklist/&gt; In 1995, ''Smutsia'' and ''Phataginus'' were moved to Appendix II. Finally, in 2016, at the 17th CITES Conference of Parties in [[Johannesburg]], representatives of 182 countries unanimously enacted a ban on the international trade of all pangolin species by moving them to Appendix I.&lt;ref name=guardian28september2016/&gt; Though the individual species are listed in Appendix I, the family as a whole (Manidae) is under Appendix II, with the implication that if additional species are discovered, they will be automatically placed in Appendix II.&lt;ref name=citeschecklist/&gt;

Despite restrictions on trade in place since 1975, enforcement is not uniformly strong. Most efforts have focused on curbing the supply side of the trade, but demand remains high and there is a thriving black market. Pangolins are believed to be the world's most trafficked mammal, accounting for as much as 20% of all illegal wildlife trade.&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph1january2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap5october2016/&gt; In 2014, the [[Worldwatch Institute]] reported that more pangolins were seized than any other animal in Asia's wildlife black market.&lt;ref name=quartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=worldwatch/&gt; Estimates place the number of pangolins poached each year at between 10,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref name=telegraph1january2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt; The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) estimates that more than a million pangolins were poached in the decade prior to 2014.&lt;ref name=iucnextinction/&gt; Most are sent to China and Vietnam, where their meat is prized and scales used for medicinal purposes.&lt;ref name=telegraph1january2015/&gt;

African and Asian nations frequently report on noteworthy confiscations of pangolins and pangolin parts. When a Chinese boat ran into a [[coral reef]] in the Philippines in 2013, officials discovered it to be carrying 10 tonnes of frozen pangolins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/15/chinese-vessel-philippine-reef-illegal-pangolin-meat|title=Chinese vessel on Philippine coral reef caught with illegal pangolin meat|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=2013-04-15|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black market==
[[File:Myanmar Illicit Endangered Wildlife Market 04 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Illicit wildlife trade in Myanmar]]

The black market pangolin trade is primarily active in Asia. Demand is particularly high for their scales, but whole animals are also sold either living or dead for the production of other products with purported medicinal properties or for consumption as exotic food.

===Scales===
[[File:Pangolin scale burn in Cameroon. Credit- Kenneth Cameron - USFWS (2) (32575640450).jpg|thumb|Confiscated pangolin scales set to be destroyed in Cameroon in 2017]]

Pangolins have a thick layer of protective scales made from [[keratin]], the same material that makes up human [[fingernail]]s and [[rhinoceros]] horns.&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015/&gt; Scales account for about 20% of the animal's weight. When threatened, pangolins curl into a ball, using the scales as armor to defend against predators.

In [[traditional Chinese medicine]], the scales are used for a variety of purposes. The pangolins are boiled to remove the scales,&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt; which are then dried and roasted, then sold based on claims that they can stimulate [[lactation]],&lt;ref name=telegraph1january2015/&gt; help to drain [[pus]],&lt;ref name=telegraph1january2015/&gt; and relieve [[skin disease]]s&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015/&gt; or [[palsy]].&lt;ref name=telegraph1january2015/&gt; {{as of|2015}}, pangolin scales were covered under some [[health insurance]] plans in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015a/&gt;

The scales can cost more than $3,000/kg on the black market.&lt;ref name=telegraph1january2015/&gt;

===Meat===
[[File:Pangolin du Cameroun 03.jpg|thumb|Pangolin prepared for cooking]]
Pangolin meat is prized as a delicacy in parts of China and Vietnam.&lt;ref name=ap5october2016/&gt; In China, the meat is believed to have nutritional value that makes it particularly good for [[kidney]] function.&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015/&gt; 

In Vietnam, restaurants can charge as much as $150 per pound of pangolin meat.&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015/&gt; At one restaurant in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], pangolin is the most expensive item on its menu of exotic wildlife, requiring a deposit and a few hours' notice. Restaurant employees kill the animal at the table, in front of diners, to show authenticity and freshness.&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015a/&gt;

According to Dan Challender of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]'s pangolin specialist group, "The fact that it's illegal isn't played down and is even attractive, because it adds this element that you live beyond the law."&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015a/&gt;

===Other products===
Though meat and scales are the primary drivers of the pangolin trade, there are also other less common parts and uses. Pangolin [[wine]] is produced by boiling [[rice wine]] with a baby pangolin.&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt; It is purported to have various healing properties, such as for treatment of [[skin disease]] and improved breathing.&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn28september2016/&gt; Pangolin [[blood]] is similarly viewed by some as having medicinal value.&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt; Pangolin skins have also been trafficked. In 2015, Uganda reported it had seized two tons of pangolin skins.&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015/&gt;

==Conservation and enforcement==

[[File:Pangolin scale burn in Cameroon. Credit- Kenneth Cameron - USFWS (1) (32575641040).jpg|thumb|left|8 tonnes of confiscated pangolin scales burning in Cameroon in 2017]]

Governments and non-governmental organizations have undertaken a variety of conservation efforts, with varying activities and degrees of success in different parts of the world. The IUCN's [[IUCN Species Survival Commission|Species Survival Commission]] formed a Pangolin Specialist Group in 2012, comprising 100 experts from 25 countries, hosted by the [[Zoological Society of London]].&lt;ref name=iucnextinction/&gt; It also coordinated an annual [[awareness day]], World Pangolin Day, on February 15, starting in 2014.&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt;

Public awareness and support for conservation efforts can be important to their success. According to Annette Olsson, technical advisor at [[Conservation International]], one of the problems the pangolin faces is that, unlike more well-known endangered animals like [[elephant]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[panda]]s, or [[tiger]]s, "It's not huge and not very charismatic. It's small and weird and just disappearing."&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015/&gt; Legal measures focus on curbing poaching and the supply side of the market, while media attention and public awareness can be crucial to the success to animal conservation efforts by affecting demand. According to CNN's John D. Sutter, "the pangolin needs international celebrity to survive, and the CITES vote is a critical step toward achieving that celebrity."&lt;ref name=cnn28september2016/&gt; In some part due to lack of attention, pangolin conservation has not been a significant recipient of funding from governments or [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]].&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt;

On 17 February 2017, a day before World Pangolin Day, officials in [[Cameroon]] burned 3 tonnes of confiscated pangolin scales, representing up to 10,000 animals. The Cameroonian government had confiscated more than 8 tonnes of pangolin scales since 2013.&lt;ref name=awf/&gt; This conservation strategy is similar to the increasingly common [[destruction of ivory|destroying confiscated ivory]] to deter poaching and generate public outrage or action. As with ivory, there is an opportunity cost to destroying the material, trading awareness via public spectacle for the money which could be gained by reselling what was confiscated.&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt;

In Vietnam, one of the countries in which the pangolin trade is most active, activists have access to only two centers able to take care of pangolins, and together they can only keep 50 animals in total.&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015a/&gt; ''CNN'' characterized Vietnamese activists as having "vastly inadequate support."&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt;

A significant challenge to conservationists is the difficulty pangolins have in captivity. The animals do not adapt well to alternative or artificial foods and suffer stress, depression and malnutrition, leading to significantly shortened lifespans.&lt;ref name=telegraph1january2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes30march2015/&gt; For these reasons they are rarely found in zoos or visible to the public while alive.&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt; For example, {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, the only zoo in the United States to have a pangolin is the [[San Diego Zoo]], and only one because the other died due to digestive problems.&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt; Part of the problem, which is also a major cause of the problem, is that without the ability to observe healthy pangolins in captivity, there is still a lot about pangolins humans have not yet been able to learn &amp;mdash; variety in their diet, maximum lifespan, maximum size, mating habits, and many aspects of their behavior.&lt;ref name=cnnchangethelist/&gt; 

In an episode of the [[BBC]] program ''[[Natural World (TV series)|Natural World]]'', [[David Attenborough]] highlighted the Sunda pangolin as one of the 10 species he would like to save from extinction, recalling rescuing "one of the most endearing animals I have ever met" from being eaten while working on a film early in his career.&lt;ref name=telegraph28october2012/&gt;

The '''political status of [[Kosovo]]''', also known as the '''Kosovo question''' ({{lang-sr|Косовско питање/Kosovsko pitanje}}) is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the [[Serbia]]n (and previously, [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]) government and the Kosovar leadership in the [[Assembly of Kosovo]], stemming from the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] (1991-92) and the ensuing [[Kosovo War]] (1998–99). In 1999 the administration of the province was handed on an interim basis to the [[United Nations]] under the terms of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UNSCR 1244]] which ended the Kosovo conflict of that year. That resolution reaffirmed the sovereignty of Serbia over Kosovo but required the [[UNMIK|UN administration]] to promote the establishment of 'substantial autonomy and self-government' for Kosovo pending a 'final settlement' for negotiation between the parties.

The UN-sponsored talks began in February 2006, and though no agreement was reached between the parties, a proposal from UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]] was presented in May 2007 which recommended 'supervised independence' for the province. After many weeks of discussions at the UN in New York, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/fc/World/Kosovo |accessdate=28 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623201334/http://news.yahoo.com/fc/World/Kosovo |archivedate=23 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2016}}

On 17 February 2008 representatives of the people of [[Kosovo]], [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence#ICJ ruling|acting outside]] the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]'s [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government|PISG]] framework issued a [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declaration of independence]] establishing the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peace.ax/en/bloggen/1286-icj-delivers-advisory-opinion-on-the-accordance-with-international-law-of-the-unilateral-declaration-of-independence-in-respect-of-kosovo-en |title=ICJ delivers advisory opinion on the accordance with international law of the unilateral declaration of independence in respect of Kosovo |website=Peace.ax |date= |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Court of Justice]] ruled that the declaration did not violate international law and argued that the signatory authors represented the broad will of the People of Kosovo, rather than the [[Assembly of Kosovo]] under the umbrella of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN resolution 1244]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15987.pdf |format=PDF |title=ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW OF THE UNILATERAL DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IN RESPECT OF KOSOVO |website=Icj-cij.org |accessdate=2016-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rRB9e3bz?url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15987.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|History of Kosovo}}

===Status in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia===
{{main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}

[[File:Banovine Jugoslavia.png|thumb|250px|right|Map showing banovinas in 1929]]

Following the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–13) and the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaties of London]] and [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1913|Bucharest]], which led to the Ottoman loss of most of the Balkans, Kosovo was governed as an integral part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], while its western part ([[Metohija]]) by the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]. [[Noel Malcolm]] argues that since the 1903 Serbian constitution was still in force at that time, Kosovo should constitutionally not have become part of Serbia, claiming that the constitution required a Grand National Assembly be held before Serbia could expand its borders, but no such assembly was ever held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Kosovo: A Short History|year=1999|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0-06-097775-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}} In 1918 Montenegro was united with Serbia, subsequently forming the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSHS), recognized in 1919 and 1920 at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] and the [[League of Nations]] and gaining a Constitution in 1921. In 1922 the historical entities were abolished by a state commission and 33 new administrative ''[[oblast]]s'' (regions) ruled from the center were instituted. In 1926 the border dispute with the [[Albanian Republic]] was resolved with most of the [[Gora (region)|Gora]] region remaining in the Kingdom.

In 1929, the Kingdom (renamed formally to "[[Yugoslavia]]") was restructured into nine large provinces called ''[[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]]'' (banates), formalized by a new Constitution in 1931. Their borders were intentionally drawn so that they would not correspond either to boundaries between ethnic groups, or to pre-World War I state borders. Most of Kosovo was allocated to the [[Zeta Banovina|Zeta Banate]] and smaller bits to the [[Morava Banovina|Moravian]] and [[Vardarska Banovina|Vardar Banates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/dagtho/yugconst19310903.html |title=The Constitution of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1931) |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021145008/http://geocities.com/dagtho/yugconst19310903.html |archivedate=21 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status in Communist Yugoslavia===

The first Constitution of the Federative People's Republic of Yugoslavia (later renamed the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], SFRY) established Kosovo-Metohija and the northern region of [[Vojvodina]] as autonomous provinces within the [[People's Republic of Serbia]]. It also promoted the [[Vardar Macedonia|Vardar region]] of southern Serbia to the status of a separate republic, the [[People's Republic of Macedonia]]. The constitution, adopted on 31 January 1946, stated that "The People's Republic of Serbia includes the autonomous province of Vojvodina and the autonomous Kosovo-Metohijan region." It did not spell out the rights and scope of the autonomous provinces, instead stating that this was a matter to be "determined by the constitution of the [parent] republic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yugoslavia_1946.txt |format=TXT |title=CONSTITUTION OF THE FEDERATIVE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA (1946) |website=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later Constitution of the SFRY, adopted on 7 April 1963, again provided for republics to "found autonomous provinces in accordance with the constitution in areas with distinctive national characteristics or in areas with other distinguishing features, on the basis of the express will of the population of these area." Within the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]], "there are the autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo and Metohija, established in 1945 by decision of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Serbia in accordance with the express will of the population of these areas." The details of the rights and scope of the provinces was, again, reserved to the republics' constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yugoslavia_1963.doc |format=DOC |title=CONSTITUTION OF THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA |website=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution, at the time the world's longest, greatly changed the constitutional setup within Yugoslavia. It increased the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina, and gave both autonomous provinces ''de facto'' veto power in the Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments as changes to their status could not be made without the consent of the two Provincial Assemblies. It also granted equal status to the Serbian, Albanian and Turkish languages and alphabets within Kosovo.

This created anomalous situation, sometimes said to be unique in world history, in which any of the provinces of Serbia could veto a decision pertaining to entire Serbia, while the parliament of Serbia could not influence decisions of the provincial parliaments. This led to central Serbia, which was not a political unit, being effectively under control of the provinces.

The 1974 Serbian constitution, adopted at the same time, reiterated that "the Socialist Republic of Serbia comprises the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] and the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], which originated in the common struggle of nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia in the National Liberation War [the Second World War] and socialist revolution...." The separately promulgated Constitution of the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo declared that:

{{cquote|The Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo is an autonomous, socialist, democratic, socio-political and self-managing community of working people and citizens, equal Albanians, Montenegrins, Muslims, Serbs, Turks, and members of other nations and nationalities and ethnic groups, based on the power of and self-management by the working class and all working people. The Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo is a part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.}}

The expansion of Kosovo's powers caused considerable discontent among Serbs, and Serbian politicians campaigned for a reversion of status changes. It became a rallying cry for a new generation of Serbian politicians.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} During the 1980s the moderate Serbian communist politician [[Ivan Stambolić]], who became [[President of Serbia]], urged the other republics to agree to a reduction in provincial autonomy.

Stambolić managed to win over the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (SKJ) to his position on this matter at the 13th Congress of the SKJ, held in 1986, and then set up a commission to work out the details of constitutional reforms. However, Stambolić was deposed by his erstwhile protégé [[Slobodan Milošević]] in 1987, who had used the issue of Kosovo to boost his political support.

=== Under Slobodan Milošević ===
The much harder-line Milošević pushed for a tougher policy towards the Kosovo Albanians. On 28 March 1989 he had the Serbian Constitution amended to give the Serbian Assembly exclusive rights to decide on the constitutional structure of the country, overturning the veto right of Kosovo and Vojvodina. According to the ICTY indictment of Milošević, when the proposed amendments were put before the Kosovo Assembly, the majority of the Assembly's members abstained in protest and the vote failed to reach the necessary two-thirds [[supermajority]]. The Speaker of the Assembly nonetheless declared that the amendments had passed and they were duly enacted.&lt;ref name="icty1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-2ai011029e.htm |title=The Prosecutor of the Tribunal against Slobodan Milosevic et al. |agency=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=2001-10-16 |accessdate=2016-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050528081303/http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-2ai011029e.htm |archivedate=28 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This however was refuted in court by Vukasin Jokanovic who was the President of the Kosovo Assembly at the time during the trial. He provided the court with a video recording of the vote along with the stenographic notes of the assembly session which clearly showed the assembly members voting in favor of the constitutional amendments by the required majority.&lt;ref name="icty2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/trans/en/041201IT.htm |title=Transcript of Vukasin Jokanovic testimony |agency=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=2004-12-01 |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, a new Serbian Constitution was enacted that drastically reduced the powers of the autonomous provinces, reserving many formerly autonomous rights to the central authorities in Belgrade. It also changed back the name of Kosovo from the '''Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo''' to the '''Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija''', returning the province to the status predating the 1970s and using the Serbian name for the western part of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serbia-info.com/facts/constitution_1.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909071238/http://www.serbia-info.com/facts/constitution_1.html |date=9 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990 constitution was strongly resisted by Kosovo's Albanians, who set up a "shadow" government to parallel the official Serb-dominated establishment. The Albanian-dominated Kosovo Assembly passed an unofficial resolution declaring Kosovo an independent entity within Yugoslavia, equivalent in status to the existing republics. A few days later the Kosovo Assembly was formally dissolved by the Serbian parliament on 5 July 1990, all its laws declared invalid and its legislative functions transferred to the Belgrade legislature. On 22 September 1991, the deposed Albanian members of the Kosovo Assembly met secretly in [[Pristina]] to declare Kosovo an independent sovereign state, the "[[Republic of Kosova]]". [[Albania]] was the only country to recognize the independence.&lt;ref name="icty1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Sell, ''Slobodan Milosevic and the Destruction of Yugoslavia'', p. 93. (Duke University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo independence was also not supported by the international community, which had maintained a consistent policy since 1991 of upholding the existing borders of the individual republics of Yugoslavia. On 10 October 1991 the CSCE (now the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]) warned that member states would "never ... recognize any changes of borders, ''whether external or internal'', brought about by force." The United States, the [[European Community]] and the Soviet Union issued a joint statement on 18 October 1991 reaffirming these principles.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne N. Lalonde, ''Determining Boundaries in a Conflicted World: The Role of Uti Possidetis'', p. 176 (McGill-Queen's Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The same set of principles remained the cornerstone of international policy towards the former Yugoslavia throughout the [[Yugoslav wars]]. Thus, for instance, the international community insisted on retaining [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]] as unified states, denying recognition to the breakaway [[Republika Srpska]] and [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]].

==Status and the Kosovo War==
Kosovo's status was a key issue in the political violence that presaged the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999. The ethnic Albanian [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] was formed after the initial attack of Serbian forces at the kosovarian village of Reçak, where 40 men and boys where executed by Serbian forces.

The international community also did not support independence for Kosovo at this stage. The [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1160|UN Security Council Resolution 1160]] on 31 March 1998 urging the parties to reach a peaceful settlement and rejecting any unilateral attempts to redraw borders, instead "affirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia." The same principles were reaffirmed in a high-level meeting during the 1999 NATO bombing campaign, when the [[G8]] foreign ministers adopted a policy of establishing "an interim administration for Kosovo ... under which the people of Kosovo can enjoy substantial autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/docu/u990610a.htm |title=Statement by the Chairman on the conclusion of the meeting of the G-8 Foreign Ministers held at the Petersberg Centre on 6 May 1999 |publisher=Nato.int |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 1999, a joint Finnish-Russian team headed by former Finnish president [[Martti Ahtisaari]] presented a set of proposals to President Milošević. These included a commitment to establish "an interim political framework agreement providing for substantial self-government for Kosovo, taking full account of the Rambouillet accords and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries of the region." Under severe pressure from the ongoing NATO bombing, Milošević agreed to withdraw Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and permit the establishment of a UN-led administration in the province, with security to be provided by a NATO-led force ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]).&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Groom &amp; Paul Taylor, "The United Nations system and the Kosovo crisis", p.303, in ''Kosovo and the Challenge of Humanitarian Intervention'', eds. Albrecht Schnabel, Ramesh Chandra Thakur. (United Nations University Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary administration of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo===
[[File:Serbia-CIA WFB Map 2006.png|right|thumb|200px|US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] map of Serbia as of June 2006, including the autonomous provinces of [[Vojvodina]] (north) and [[Kosovo]] (south)]]
Kosovo's constitutional status of the period June 1999-February 2008 was established by the United Nations in [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1244]], adopted on 10 June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/docu/u990610a.htm |title=NATO &amp; Kosovo : UN Resolution 1244 (1999) - 10 June 1999 |publisher=Nato.int |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council placed Kosovo under the temporary administration of the [[United Nations Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK), under the leadership of a [[Special Representative of the Secretary General]]. It also explicitly upheld the existing sovereignty of Serbia over Kosovo, "reaffirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other States of the region, as set out in the [[Helsinki Final Act]] and annex 2 [the Finnish-Russian proposals]." It also established a requirement that the post-conflict status process must take full account of "the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."

In a public speech on 9 June 1999, President Slobodan Milošević declared:

{{cquote|We have not given up Kosovo. The Group of Eight most developed countries of the world and the United Nations guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country. This guarantee is also contained in the draft resolution. The Belgrade agreement has closed the open issues of the possible independence of Kosovo at the time prior to the aggression. The territorial entirety of our country cannot he threatened ... the political process, which will be based on the principles which stem from previously conducted discussions [is] also equally based on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country. This means that only autonomy, and nothing else outside that, can be mentioned in this political process.&lt;ref&gt;"Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's Address To The Nation", ''Borba'', 10 June 1999; quoted in Stephen T Hosmer, ''The Conflict Over Kosovo: Why Milosevic Decided to Settle When He Did'', p. 118 (Rand Corporation, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The reality on the ground was rather different, as Ylber Hysa has noted. Although "Resolution 1244 respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo", and even provided for Serbian troops to be stationed in the province, on the ground "certain territories are under the full control of KFOR and the international administration" without any Serbian involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Ylber Hysa, "Kosovo: a permanent international protectorate?", p. 288 in ''The UN Role in Promoting Democracy: Between Ideals and Reality'', eds. Edward Newman, Roland Rich (United Nations University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this part of the resolution was never implemented. The severely circumscribed control exercised by Serbia in Kosovo has led many commentators to describe the nature of its sovereignty as purely "nominal".

William G. O'Neill comments that the resolution's wording was also intended "to reassure Republic of Macedonia, which has a substantial Albanian minority, that its territorial borders were not at risk. It also can be seen as a warning to Albania not even to think about any territorial expansion to create a 'greater Albania'." &lt;ref&gt;William G O'Neill, ''Kosovo: An Unfinished Peace'', p. 35. (Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 2001, UNMIK enacted a "Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmikonline.org/constframework.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230123314/http://www.unmikonline.org/constframework.htm |date=30 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it provides a constitutional ''framework'', it is not a ''constitution'', and is deliberately nonjudgmental on the question of sovereignty, as UNMIK itself does not have a role in the determination of Kosovo's final status.&lt;ref name="unsc5522"&gt;Joachim Rücker, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of UNMIK. [http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/PRO/N06/519/29/PDF/N0651929.pdf Record of the 5522nd meeting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926214739/http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/PRO/N06/519/29/PDF/N0651929.pdf |date=26 September 2007 }}, Wednesday, 13 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It defines Kosovo as "an entity under interim international administration" and "an undivided territory".

Crucially, Kosovo's own institutions were specifically barred from making any unilateral decisions about the province's status. The Constitutional Framework states that the [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]] (PISG) "shall not in any way affect or diminish the ultimate authority of the SRSG [Special Representative of the Secretary General] for the implementation of UNSCR 1244". The Kosovo Assembly is in effect prohibited to make any decisions or declarations on the future status of Kosovo &lt;ref&gt;Hækkerup, Hans.

The 2003 Constitution of the newly created state of [[Serbia and Montenegro]] officially acknowledged Kosovo's new interim status, describing Serbia and Montenegro as "the state of Montenegro and the state of Serbia which includes the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina and the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, the latter currently under international administration in accordance with UN SC resolution 1244."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/SerbMont_Const_2003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Constitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro |website=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Serbia drafted a new constitution that again referred to Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5339848.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Serbian PM plans new Kosovo law |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-09-12 |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbia's interference in Kosovo has caused significant problems{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. UNMIK was given exclusive rights to manage Kosovo's economic affairs and stated its intent in the Constitutional Framework to establish a [[market economy]]. Prior to 1999, much of Kosovo's economy had been controlled by the state. All publicly owned enterprises were owned by the Yugoslav government or the Serbian state, both governed from Belgrade. When UNMIK began implementing [[privatization]] of assets that it did not own, Serbs with interests in the companies subject to privatization sued first UNMIK and then the UN in New York.

Swedish economist [[Jessica Johnsson]] claims that the fact that Kosovo is still regarded in law as being part of Serbia, as well as the ongoing political tensions, has caused it significant difficulties in achieving economic development and that its uncertain legal status has prevented it from accessing lending from International Financial Institutions such as the [[World Bank]].

===Resolution 1244===
[[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|Resolution 1244]], passed in 1999, reaffirmed in its preamble the "commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and [[territorial integrity]] of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" and authorised "an international civil presence in Kosovo in order to provide an interim administration for Kosovo under which the people of Kosovo can enjoy substantial autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia", i.e. the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK), with security provided by a [[NATO]]-led [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR).  The Resolution also authorised a process to determine Kosovo's final status.   Concerning the latter, Annex 1 to the Resolution states that the "political solution to the Kosovo crisis" should take "full account of ... the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia".

==Status process (2006–2008)==
===Initial UN-backed talks (2006)===
The UN-facilitated Kosovo future status process was led by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], former president of Finland; Austrian diplomat Albert Rohan is his deputy.  Ahtisaari's office&amp;nbsp;— the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo (UNOSEK)&amp;nbsp;— is located in [[Vienna]], Austria, and includes liaison staff from [[NATO]], the [[European Union|EU]] and the United States.&lt;ref name="UNOSEK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unosek.org/unosek |title=United Nations Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo |publisher=UNOSEK |date=2007-08-01 |accessdate=2010-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723173945/http://www.unosek.org/unosek/ |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahtisaari is supported in his efforts by Ambassador Frank G. Wisner, the U.S. Representative to the Kosovo Status Talks.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/58288.htm Appointment of Ambassador Frank G. Wisner As The Special Representative of the Secretary of State to the Kosovo Status Talks] ", by Condoleezza Rice, Washington, DC, 19 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahtisaari holds regular meetings with representatives of the [[Contact Group]].

The initial status negotiations focused on technical issues important for Kosovo's long-term stability, particularly the rights and protection of Kosovo's minorities (especially the Kosovo Serbs).  Ahtisaari brought the parties together for the first direct dialogue in February 2006 to discuss decentralization of local government, which is an important measure to protect Kosovo Serb communities.  Subsequent meetings addressed economic issues, property rights, protection of Serbian Orthodox Church heritage and institutional guarantees for the rights of Kosovo's minorities.&lt;ref name="SETimes15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNOSEK" /&gt;

On 24 July 2006, Ahtisaari brought the parties together in Vienna for the first high-level talks on the status outcome itself.  Serbian President [[Boris Tadić]], Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]], Kosovo President [[Fatmir Sejdiu]] and Prime Minister [[Agim Çeku]] attended and presented their respective platforms for Kosovo's future status.  Ahtisaari later told the press that the meeting resulted in no breakthroughs, but added that the discussion was "frank and candid" and the atmosphere was better than he could have expected.&lt;ref name="BBCnobreak" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kosovo.net/news/archive/2006/July_26/1.html Serbian, Kosovo Albanian talks fail to reach breakthrough on future status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014538/http://www.kosovo.net/news/archive/2006/July_26/1.html |date=2007-09-30 }} " ''[[Agence France-Presse]]'' (AFP), Vienna, 24 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahtisaari briefed Contact Group foreign ministers on 20 September 2006, in New York City at a meeting chaired by [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]].  At that meeting, the Contact Group released a press statement that reaffirmed its desire to work towards a negotiated settlement in the course of 2006 and also endorsed Ahtisaari's plans to develop a comprehensive proposal for a status settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2006/72892.htm Kosovo Contact Group Ministerial Statement], New York, 20 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After consultations with the Contact Group in Vienna on 10 November, Ahtisaari decided to delay sharing his proposal with the parties until after Serbia held [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary elections]] on 21 January 2007. He said he would take his proposal to the parties "without delay" after these elections.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6136282.stm UN delays report on Kosovo future] ", ''BBC News'', 10 November 2006.; [http://www.unosek.org/pressrelease/2006-11-10_-_Statement_by_the_SE_after_consultations_with_the_Contact_Group.pdf Statement by Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari after consultations with the Contact Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222192940/http://www.unosek.org/pressrelease/2006-11-10_-_Statement_by_the_SE_after_consultations_with_the_Contact_Group.pdf |date=2006-12-22 }}, 10 November 2006 (.pdf file).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued discussions===
On 3 April, Ahtisaari presented to the UN Security Council his final package of proposals, which included a clear recommendation that Kosovo should become independent subject to a period of international supervision.&lt;ref name="SETimes15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4489028 Kosovo's status - the wheels grind on]", ''The Economist'', 6 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,402188,00.html Negotiations Lean Toward Independence]", ''Der Spiegel'', 20 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pristina accepted Ahtisaari's final Settlement, while Belgrade rejected it. Immediately after the proposals became public, the United States and Germany (in its capacity as EU Presidency) issued strong statements of support. The [[European Union]]'s Parliament also declared its full support to Ahtisaari's plan.  Russia, however, called for new rounds of negotiations, possibly with a new special envoy. At least one other member of the Security Council, South Africa, a non-permanent member, has expressed agreement with Russian concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/bronwen_maddox/article1774525.ece The dark shadows hanging over Kosovo | Bronwen Maddox: World Briefing - Times Online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727031207/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/bronwen_maddox/article1774525.ece |date=July 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May, European members of the UN Security Council, Germany and the United States circulated a draft UN Security Council resolution that would replace UN Security Council Resolution 1244, endorse Ahtisaari's Settlement and end the UN administration after a transition period of 120 days.  The U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN said that the European/U.S. draft had enough support in the Security Council to be adopted unless Russia chooses to use its Security Council veto, which Russia has stated at numerous occasions that it might use unless the resolution is acceptable by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/radio/news/RS/nnF/nnFItemDesc.asp?id=10132 |title=Russia Might Veto Kosovo Independence Proposal - U.S. Likes the Plan |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20070424/64272686.html |title=Russia threatens to veto UN Kosovo resolution - dept.

Russia rejected a UN Security Council resolution based on the Ahtisaari Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f3f09aae-30a0-11dc-9a81-0000779fd2ac.html |title=/ World - Russia rejects plan for Kosovo |publisher=Ft.com |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As discussions progressed in the week of 16 July, seemingly with little hope of agreement, [[European Union|EU]] foreign policy chief [[Javier Solana]] was quoted as saying that the European Union would cease supporting efforts to agree a resolution backing the Ahtisaari plan 'within days' if Russian concerns could not be met. Russia had rejected another draft resolution on Monday 16 July which had called for further talks between Serbia and Kosovo Albanians, describing the draft as, 'permeated with the concept of the independence of Kosovo'. British Deputy Head of Mission in New York, [[Karen Pierce]], told reporters on 17 July that a final draft of the resolution would be introduced 'within 36 hours'.

According to news service Reuters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8e12741a-347d-11dc-8c78-0000779fd2ac.html |title=/ World - EU and US introduce Kosovo resolution |publisher=Ft.com |date=2007-10-14 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solana had said that a further, four-month period of talks would be conducted under the authority of the [[Contact Group]], though did not discount that a resolution might still be agreed in the coming days. German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] appeared to support renewed talks between the parties after discussions with Serbian Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]], 'We are now thinking about whether it would be possible to support a phase of negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina to try once again to find a solution,' Merkel was quoted as saying.

The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing.&lt;ref name=

The UN Secretary-General later endorsed another time-limited round of negotiations led by a U.S./EU/Russian Troika of negotiators.  The Troika completed its work on 10 December 2007, without having achieved an agreement between the parties on Kosovo's status.

===Ahtisaari Plan===
{{main article|Ahtisaari Plan}}
UN-backed talks on the status of Kosovo, led by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], began in February 2006 with the aim of completing them by the end of that year. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both Kosovo and Serbia remain diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-10-09 |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister of Kosovo's [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government|Provisional Institutions]], [[Agim Çeku]] stated that his government would accept nothing less than independence and would not contemplate partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawton |first=Nick |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5235868.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Analysis: Kosovo's anxious wait |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-08-01 |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the part of Serbia, Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]] stated Serbia would give Kosovo full autonomy but could not accept independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5232320.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Serbia rejects Kosovo trade-off |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-07-31 |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the [[Contact Group]] of leading nations is that Kosovo "must remain multi-ethnic and the settlement must be acceptable to the people of Kosovo. Additionally, there will be no return of Kosovo to the pre-1999 situation, no partition of Kosovo and no union of Kosovo with any other, or part of another, country."&lt;ref name="unsc5522" /&gt; While not yet mentioning the word "independence," the draft Settlement included several provisions that were widely interpreted as implying statehood for Kosovo.

In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. As of early July 2007 the draft resolution, which is backed by the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council, had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |publisher=SETimes.com |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States called the proposal "fair and balanced,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2007/february/79774.htm Presentation of Kosovo Status Proposal to the Parties], Sean McCormack, U.S. Department of State spokesman, Washington, DC, 2 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; while the EU Presidency noted that Ahtisaari's proposals "build on almost twelve months of direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu2007.de/en/News/CFSP_Statements/February/0202Kosovo.html EU Presidency Statement on the Kosovo status proposals to be presented today by Martti Ahtisaari in Belgrade and Pristina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208061300/http://www.eu2007.de/en/News/CFSP_Statements/February/0202Kosovo.html |date=2007-02-08 }}, 2 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, stated that it will not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02 |title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo |publisher=SETimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgrade, [[Prime Minister of Serbia|Serbian Prime Minister]] [[Vojislav Koštunica]] refused to receive Ahtisaari.  Koštunica claimed that because Serbia had still not formed a new government after the January 21 parliamentary elections he had no mandate to discuss Kosovo and therefore could not meet Ahtisaari.  Nevertheless, he later denounced the proposal as "illegitimate and unacceptable" because he alleged it "violates the U.N.

After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing.

===Serbian constitutional referendum===
{{main|Serbian constitutional referendum, 2006}}
A referendum on a proposed draft of the new [[Serbian constitution]] was held on 28 October and 29 October 2006 and has resulted in the draft constitution being approved by the Serbian electorate.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6097344.stm |publisher=BBC |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-30 |title=Serbia backs draft constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution is Serbia's first as an independent state since the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]'s 1903 constitution. Over 6.6 million people were entitled to vote in the national referendum. Kosovo did not vote. During the nearly one-century of Serbian rule in Kosovo, this is the only attempt to legally incorporate Kosovo into Serbia, and it was seen by Albanians as an attempt to prejudge the result of the negotiations. In the [[preamble]] to the constitution it states that "Kosovo is an autonomous province of Serbia with significant autonomy". Serbian legal scholars found that this unambiguous statement means it would be unconstitutional for Kosovo to secede from Serbia.

===Positions of the parties===
*Serbia's position on the status of Kosovo is that Kosovo should enjoy substantial autonomy, but not be granted independence. Frequently dubbed "more than autonomy, less than independence," Belgrade's vision for Kosovo includes expanding autonomy in which Kosovo is largely free to govern itself, although Kosovo would not be permitted an independent role in international relations or defence and would remain nominally within the state of Serbia. The Serbian side has also proposed the [[One Country Two Systems]] formula, i.e. the "Hong Kong model" as a solution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Policy/CI/KIM/301105_3_e.html |title=Compromise by way of "One Country-Two Systems" formula |publisher=Mfa.gov.rs |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/expressnews/news.htm?expressnews&amp;20071107&amp;55&amp;444658 |title=RTHK |publisher=[[RTHK]] |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but it was rejected by the Albanian politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/071105/world/kosovo_talks AP] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Agence France Presse|AFP]] |date=Nov 6, 2007 |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Kosovo_rejects_Hong_Kong_model_proposed_by_Serbia/articleshow/2520832.cms |title=Kosovo rejects Hong Kong model proposed by Serbia |work=[[Times of India]] |accessdate=2010-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220185344/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Kosovo_rejects_Hong_Kong_model_proposed_by_Serbia/articleshow/2520832.cms |archivedate=December 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Serbia argues that Kosovo's independence would be a violation of Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and therefore contrary to the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]] and principles of international law. Belgrade also asserts the [[United Nations Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]] has allowed widespread discrimination against Kosovo's Serb minority and has not facilitated the return of about 200,000 of [[internally displaced persons]] who fled Kosovo during and immediately after the conflict. Serbia insists that [[UNSCR 1244]], which envisioned a UN-facilitated political process to determine status, precludes independence through a preambular reference to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (now Serbia). Serbian Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]] has said that, '...any imposed solution that would seize part of our territory would be a violation of international law.'&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,1599732,00.html Serbs accuse UN of violation of law over Kosovo independence] ", by [[Ewen MacAskill]], ''[[The Guardian]] (UK)'', 25 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Kosovo Albanians generally assert that they could not remain within a Serbian state citing the repression by the [[Slobodan Milošević|Milošević]] government in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="SETimes15"&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2006/12/15/feature-02 Negotiations on status of Kosovo still under way] ", by Blerta Foniqi-Kabashi, ''Southeast European Times'', Pristina, 15 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo Prime Minister [[Agim Çeku]] claimed that "recognizing Kosovo's independence would close the dark chapters of Balkan history, and create the opportunity for a new and sustainable regional stability." &lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/11/AR2006121100972.html Succeeding in Kosovo] ", by Agim Çeku, ''The Washington Post'', 12 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In November 2005, the [[Contact Group]] countries released a set of "Guiding Principles" for the resolution of Kosovo's status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unosek.org/docref/Contact%20Group%20-%20Ten%20Guiding%20principles%20for%20Ahtisaari.pdf Guiding principles of the Contact Group for a settlement of the status of Kosovo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061221234536/http://www.unosek.org/docref/Contact%20Group%20-%20Ten%20Guiding%20principles%20for%20Ahtisaari.pdf |date=2006-12-21 }}, November 2005 (.pdf file).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosovo.net/news/archive/2005/November_15/2.html Contact Group's Guiding Principles for a Settlement of Kosovo's Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506154459/http://kosovo.net/news/archive/2005/November_15/2.html |date=2006-05-06 }}, November 2005 (.html).&lt;/ref&gt; These principles notably included the requirement that there be no return to the situation prior to 1999 and that there be no change in Kosovo's borders (i.e., no partition of Kosovo) and no union of Kosovo with any neighboring state.&lt;ref name="SETimes15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCnobreak"&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5208920.stm No breakthrough at Kosovo talks] ", ''BBC News'', 24 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The same statement includes a call for all parties to refrain from unilateral steps and reject any form of violence. The Contact Group affirms that the final decision on the status of Kosovo should be endorsed by the UN Security Council.  At a January 2006 meeting of foreign ministers, the Contact Group further declared that a settlement "needs, inter alia, to be acceptable to the people of Kosovo" and emphasized the need for the settlement to address the concerns of Kosovo's ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="SETimes15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CGjan2006"&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/62459.htm Statement by the Contact Group on the Future of Kosovo] ", Washington, DC, 31 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] stated in September 2006 that the world must apply the same standards to the separatist Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as it does to the Serbian province of Kosovo, where many are seeking independence. He also added that Russia would not endorse any UN Security Council resolution which it felt compromised these rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/13/europe/EU_GEN_Russia_Kosovo.php Putin says world should regard Kosovo, separatist Georgian regions on equal footing], ''[[Associated Press]]'', 13 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=15&amp;nav_category=92&amp;nav_id=39082 Koštunica talks to Putin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227225637/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=15&amp;nav_category=92&amp;nav_id=39082 |date=2007-02-27 }} ''B92''. 15 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

*A NATO report on the question of Kosovo's status states that a region may have the right of secession in the case of foreign occupation or if the region is a colony of another nation. The NATO report claims, while mentioning disagreement on the interpretation, that a third condition exists when "a people whose right to internal self-determination has been thoroughly violated by a Government that does not represent the people" and suggests Kosovo qualifies under this condition. It concludes, while there is a case in favor of a right to secession for Kosovo, it rejects the right to secession in cases where regions are open to democratic mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 17 February 2008, Kosovo declared independence.

Kosovo will respect the advisory opinion." For his part, Serbia's President, Boris Tadić, warned that "If the International Court of Justice sets a new principle, it would trigger a process that would create several new countries and destabilise numerous regions in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/07/201072232633925457.html |title=ICJ rules on Kosovo statehood - Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PolyDay''' is a one-day convention/conference held in the UK, celebrating [[polyamory]]. Polyday began in 2006 and has been run most years since. The event consists of workshops and discussions during the day and social events in the evening. In 2012 it became associated with the international event, Poly Party Weekend. As of 2016, Polyday became an unincorporated charitable association.

The content of each Polyday differs slightly each year. Features that have been consistent so far include a basic introduction to polyamory, useful literature, people to chat to, arts/crafts and cake. Other sessions such as activism, poly parenting, relationship styles and mental/sexual health have been offered. 

Everyone is welcome, whether they are poly or not, partners, friends or allies of poly people provided they are open and accepting of other attendees. Strict rules apply to photography and members of the press who wish to attend, so as to protect the privacy of other attendees.

==Past events==

The first Polyday, in 2004, was held at the Leicester LGB Centre. Following this other events have happened in London every year since 2006 - except for the 2010 event, held in Bristol.

'''''Pride's Crossing''''' is a play by [[Tina Howe]]. It received the [[New York Drama Critics Circle]] Award for Best American Play and was a finalist for the 1997 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama "Pulitzer Prize for Drama"] Pulitzer.org, accessed September 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The play focuses on 90-year-old Mabel Tidings Bigelow, who as a young woman was the first female to swim the [[English Channel]] from [[England]] to [[France]]. In her introduction to the play, Howe wrote, "For some time now I've wanted to write about the passion of old ladies." &lt;ref name=script&gt;Howe, Tina. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=mwrKUh732jUC&amp;dq=%22Tina+Howe%22+%22Pride's+Crossing%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=P-IWP07fd4&amp;sig=bh6wAuC1fGR2wq0kHHn1X8qpqJY&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result "Script"] ''Pride's Crossing'' (books,google.com), Samuel French, Inc., 1998, {{ISBN|0573626561}}, pp.4, 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
''Pride's Crossing'' was first produced at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in [[San Diego]] in January 1997. Directed by [[Jack O'Brien (director)|Jack O'Brien]], it starred [[Cherry Jones]] as Mabel.&lt;ref name=script/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Viagas, Robert. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/cherry-jones-to-star-in-new-tina-howe-play-329084# "Cherry Jones to Star in New Tina Howe Play"] Playbill, January 25, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Brien and Jones reunited for the Off-Broadway [[Lincoln Center Theater]] production, which opened at the [[Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater]] on December 7, 1997 and closed on April 5, 1998 after 137 performances. The cast included [[Dylan Baker]], Julia McIlvaine, David Lansbury, and [[Casey Biggs]].&lt;ref name=lortel&gt;[http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&amp;id=380 "'Pride's Crossing' Listing, 1997"] lortel.org, accessed September 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Brantley]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' said the play can "seem as garrulous and repetitive as a conversation-starved alumna at a 50-year college reunion. The affection that animates the play is evident . . . so is the dramatist's ear for the music in everyday conversation. But while ''Pride's Crossing'' is infused with Ms. Howe's lyrical sense of mortality and of the traps of sexual and social identity, this latest work from the author of ''[[Coastal Disturbances]]'' can also be like something its no-nonsense heroine might start to read and throw out as romantic hokum . . . Ms. Howe has said her works tend to alienate men because of her expressly feminine perspective. But the special flavor of her writing has more to do with a kind of whimsy that translates theatrical absurdism into costume-party cuteness."

The play was revived at the [[Off-Broadway]] T. Schreiber Studio from March 25 - April 18, 2004. Glenn Krutoff directed Tatjana Vujosevic as Mabel Tidings Bigelow.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.

Schreiber Studio, March 25-April 18"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015204914/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/85102.html |date=2008-10-15 }} Playbill.com, March 25, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
As the time goes backward and forward, Mabel Tidings Bigelow is seen in the present as a 90-year-old woman. She is then seen as a shy young woman from a rich and privileged Boston family, but who is most comfortable with the servants. Through her love of swimming, she finds strength and endurance. As she prepares to swim the English Channel her mother
does not approve and her father is not present very often. In her old age, Mabel makes a connection with her young great-granddaughter, Minty Renoir.

The '''Republican marches''' ({{lang-fr|Marches républicaines}}) were a series of rallies that took place in cities across [[France]] on 10–11 January 2015 to honour the victims of the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|Montrouge shooting]], and the [[Porte de Vincennes siege]], and also to voice support for [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref name="BB9JAN"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-09/shots-fired-hostages-taken-in-town-northeast-of-paris.html | title=Paris Terror Suspects Killed in Twin French Police Raids | work=Bloomberg | date=9 January 2014 | accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French government officials estimated that the rallies were attended by up to 3.7 million people nationwide, making them the largest public rallies in France since 1944, when [[Liberation of Paris|Paris was liberated]] from the Nazis at the end of [[World War II]], and also the biggest in French history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hinnant |first1=Lori |last2=Adamson |first2=Thomas |title=Officials: Paris Unity Rally Largest in French History |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_FRANCE_ATTACKS_RALLY?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2015-01-11-12-51-46 |accessdate=11 January 2015 |work=Associated Press |date=11 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111213526/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_FRANCE_ATTACKS_RALLY?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2015-01-11-12-51-46 |archivedate=11 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris attacks: Millions rally for unity in France|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30765824|accessdate=12 January 2015|work=BBC News|date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Paris]], due to the expected number of people, three streets were planned for the march from [[Place de la République]] to [[Place de la Nation]]. It was estimated that between 1.5 and 2 million people marched down and nearby [[Boulevard Voltaire]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faiola|first1=Anthony|last2=Witte|first2=Griff|title=Massive crowds join march for solidarity in Paris|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/hundreds-of-thousands-are-expected-to-march-in-paris-solidarity-rally/2015/01/11/3befc7e2-996e-11e4-927a-4fa2638cd1b0_story.html?hpid=z2|accessdate=11 January 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=France attacks: Million-strong unity rally in Paris|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30765824|accessdate=11 January 2015|work=BBC News|date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris marches were attended by 40 world leaders, from both Europe and around the world. The presence during the marches of foreign leaders who are accused of not respecting freedom of speech in their own country has been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/marche-republicaine-c-est-dur-d-etre-recupere-par-des-cons-11-01-2015-1895651_23.php|title=Marche républicaine : "C'est dur d'être récupéré par des cons"|work=Le Point.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cities in France, more than 300,000 rallied in [[Lyon]], about a quarter of the population. More than 100,000 marched the streets of [[Rennes]], [[Toulouse]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Grenoble]], [[Montpellier]] and [[Marseille]] (within two days). Major rallies took place in [[Montreal]], [[Brussels]], [[Berlin]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt;

In an interview prior to the Republican Marches, [[Luz (cartoonist)|Luz]], one of the survivors of the attack, described the show of support for the magazine as "wonderful", but bemoaned a lack of diversity of views in the public discourse following the attacks, which he said served the purposes of politicians, as well the use of symbols, which he characterised as contrary to the values of the magazine. He noted that, following the attacks, ''The Marseillaise'' had been sung in public, which his dead colleagues would have scorned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesinrocks.com/2015/01/10/actualite/luz-tout-le-monde-nous-regarde-est-devenu-des-symboles-11545315/|title=Luz : "Tout le monde nous regarde, on est devenu des symboles"|date=10 January 2015|work=Les Inrockuptibles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also speaking prior to the Marches, [[Bernard Willem Holtrop|Willem]], another surviving cartoonist, said that a demonstration in support of free expression would be "naturally a good thing", but rejected the support of far-right figures such as [[Geert Wilders]] and [[Marine Le Pen]]: "We vomit on those who suddenly declare that they are our friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/dossier-aanslag-op-charlie-hebdo/willem-holtrop-lacht-om-zijn-nieuwe-vrienden~a3826650/|title='We gaan nog zeker twintig jaar door'|date=10 January 2015|work=Volkskrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Did not attend ===

* {{flagicon|Iceland}} [[Prime Minister of Iceland]] [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]] did not attend the march; his office released a statement citing the short notice, travel time and the Prime Minister's schedule, and emphasized that no invitation had been rejected, as none had been sent to him specifically.

== National Front controversy ==
During the organisation march, a controversy arose when [[Marine Le Pen]] was told she was not invited in the marches. This is due to the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] reputation of divisiveness. [[François Lamy (politician)|François Lamy]], one of the organisers, said it is not where the National Front should be; it is not where a political party which, for years, has divided French citizens because of their origin or their religion should be.&lt;ref&gt;«Il n’y a pas de place» pour le Front national à la «marche républicaine»  «Il n’y a pas de place pour une formation politique qui, depuis des années, divise les Français, stigmatise les concitoyens en fonction de leur origine ou de leur religion, ou ne se situe pas dans une démarche de rassemblement des Français»
http://www.ledauphine.com/france-monde/2015/01/08/marine-le-pen-denonce-son-exclusion-de-la-marche-republicaine&lt;/ref&gt; The President closed this political issue declaring that "every citizen can come...it is not controlled."&lt;ref&gt;
"Tous les citoyens peuvent venir (...), il n'y a pas de contrôles"

[[File:Interior of St. James Theatre, London (watercolour) by John Gregory Crace.jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration of the interior by [[John Gregory Crace (designer)|John Gregory Crace]]]]
'''St James's Theatre''' (''est.'' 1835) was a 1,200-seat theatre located in [[King Street, St James's|King Street]], at Duke Street, [[St James's]], London. The elaborate theatre was designed with a [[neo-classical exterior]] and a Louis XIV style interior by [[Samuel Beazley]] and built by the partnership of [[Morton Peto|Peto &amp; Grissell]] for the [[tenor]] and theatre director, [[John Braham]]. The interior was decorated by the Frederick Crace Company.

==History==
The theatre opened on 14 December 1835 with a mixed programme of an operatic burletta, ''Agnes Sorel'', starring Braham, and two farces by [[Gilbert Abbott à Beckett]]. In 1840, it changed its name to "Prince's Theatre", but changed it back in 1841. The theatre was rebuilt several times: in 1869, 1879-80.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andreas-praefcke.de/carthalia/uk/uk_london_stjames.htm Profile of the theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;  It closed on 27 July 1957 and was demolished and rebuilt as an office building.

===Early years at the theatre===
Productions at the theatre included [[opera]], Shakespearian readings, [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] of opera, [[ballet]], foreign plays, magicians, operetta and new plays. Braham's company struggled financially and after a few seasons he gave up. In 1842, John Mitchell took over the theatre, producing mostly French comedies and plays with the greatest stars of the French stage, and the theatre was a success and became fashionable for a dozen years, even being visited frequently by the [[Queen Victoria]].

[[File:St-Jamess-theatre-1836(Crop).jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of the theatre in 1836]]
In 1846, an amateur performance of [[Ben Jonson]]’s ''Every Man in his Humour'' included [[Charles Dickens]] playing Captain Bobadil.  In 1846, the [[Ethiopian Serenaders]] infected London with the American craze for [[minstrel show]]s, a form of entertainment which was to remain popular until the turn of the century. Not long afterwards, the [[Christy Minstrels]] opened in London at the theatre on 3 August 1857 before moving to other venues. Their success led to the phrase "Christy Minstrels" coming to mean any blackface minstrel show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/newsletters/gossip/no10/gg10.doc Article quoting Andrews, Frank in ''the Talking Machine Review'', November 1977 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[F. C. Burnand]] produced his first major play at the St James's, a burlesque called ''Dido'', in 1860. [[Benjamin Nottingham Webster]] was the manager of the theatre for a time.

In 1866, the theatre presented [[Henry Irving]]'s first big success in London as Rawdon Scudamore in ''Hunted Down; or, The Two Lives of Mary Leigh'', by [[Dion Boucicault]]. In addition, that year saw one of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s earliest plays, ''[[Dulcamara! or, The Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'', a parody of [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]''. In 1869, the newly renovated theatre presented [[Mrs. John Wood]], then the proprietress, in a long run (for those days, 160 performances) of ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]''.  [[Thomas W. Robertson]]'s last play, ''War'', was produced in 1871, and he died the following month. In 1875, Gilbert's collaborator, [[Arthur Sullivan]] (they had just produced their one-act opera, ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' at another theatre), produced ''[[The Zoo]]'', and Gilbert was back the same year with his farce, ''[[Tom Cobb]]; or, Fortune's Toy'', and in 1888 with a drama, ''[[Brantinghame Hall]]'', under the management of [[Rutland Barrington]], that flopped badly. Barrington had previously produced ''The Dean's Daughter'' by [[Sydney Grundy]] at the theatre that year, another flop.&lt;ref&gt;Barrington p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mrs. Wood, [[Madge Kendal]] and her husband [[William Hunter Kendal]] took over the theatre together with [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]], renovating it again in 1879. In 1880, [[Tom Taylor]]'s ''Still Waters Run Deep'' was produced, the first of several of his works. About a dozen [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] plays also followed. Some of their notable successes included ''The Squire'', ''Impulse'', ''The Ironmaster'' and ''A Scrap of Paper''. [[Lillie Langtry]] took over briefly in 1890, presenting ''[[As You Like It]]'' and [[Sydney Grundy]]'s ''Esther Sandraz''.

===The George Alexander and inter-war period===
[[File:The Importance of Being Earnest - Cigarettecase.jpg|thumb|''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' in 1895 with [[Allan Aynesworth]] as Algernon (left) and [[George Alexander (actor)|Alexander]] as Jack]]By the end of 1890, [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]] had taken over the theatre, and he remained in charge for the rest of his life, until 1918. In 1892, he produced [[Oscar Wilde]]’s first great success, ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]''. In 1895, Wilde's ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' premiered at the theatre. Other Alexander triumphs included ''The Second Mrs. Tanqueray'', by Pinero (1893); ''The Prisoner of Zenda'', by [[Anthony Hope]] (1896); ''[[As You Like It]]'' (1896); ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (1898); ''Paolo and Francesca'', by [[Stephen Phillips]] (1902); ''If I were King'', by [[Justin Huntly McCarthy]] (1902); ''Old Heidelberg'', by Meyer Forster and Bleichmann (1903) and ''His House in Order'', by Pinero (1906), to name only a few of the plays still remembered. Also premiered during that time was [[George Bernard Shaw]]’s ''Androcles and the Lion'' in 1913.

After Alexander died, the lease was taken over by [[Gilbert Miller]], the American impresario, who later purchased the theatre and owned it up to its eventual sale for re-development and demolition. The first play of the new era was ''The Eyes of Youth'', which ran for 383 performances. In 1923, ''The Green Goddess'', by [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]], started its run of 417 performances. Sir [[Gerald du Maurier]] was actor-manager of the St James's for several years in the 1920s and '30s. He had appeared there as Lord Arthur Dilling in ''The Last of Mrs. Cheyney'' by [[Frederick Lonsdale]] (1925), which ran for 514 performances, being succeeded in that role by [[Henry Daniell]]. ''Interference'' (1927), by Ronald Pertwee and Harold Dearden was another big success and ran for 412 performances. Daniell appeared again at the St James's in 1928 as Satollyon in ''The Return Journey'' and in 1932 as Max Lawrence in ''The Vinegar Tree''. In 1929, [[Alfred Lunt]] made his London debut with his wife [[Lynn Fontanne]] in the Theatre Guild production of ''Caprice''. A number of very successful plays ran at the theatre in the 1930s and '40s, including [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[And Then There Were None (play)|Ten Little Niggers]]'', which was interrupted when a bomb damaged the roof of the theatre in 1944.

[[File:Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier, Broadbeach, Australia, 1948.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vivien Leigh]] and [[Laurence Olivier]] (1948)]]

===Last years===
Other famous actors who performed at the theatre included [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], [[William Terriss]], [[J. L. Toole]], [[Rutland Barrington]] (who became bankrupt managing the theatre for a time), [[Henry Ainley]] (who briefly co-managed with [[Gilbert Miller]]), [[Claude Rains]], [[Charles Hawtrey (stage actor)|Charles Hawtrey]] and [[Orson Welles]]. [[Laurence Olivier]] and his wife [[Vivien Leigh]] took over the management of the theatre in 1950, opening with [[Christopher Fry]]’s new play, ''Venus Observed''. In 1951, they produced and starred in an ambitious production of both Shaw's ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' and Shakespeare's ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' for the [[Festival of Britain]]. Later the same year, at Olivier's invitation, the French actors [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] and [[Madeleine Renaud]] presented a three-week season at the theatre with their own company.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Edward and Peter O'Hagan. 2016. ''Pierre Boulez Studies''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 303–305. {{ISBN|978-1-107-06265-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, a [[Terence Rattigan]] play, ''[[Separate Tables]]'', commenced a run of 726 performances, a record for this theatre. The play (actually two one-act plays, both taking place in the same setting at a hotel in [[Bournemouth]]) was intended to star Olivier and Leigh, but scheduling did not permit this, and the plays starred [[Margaret Leighton]] and [[Eric Portman]].

In 1957, St James's Theatre was scheduled for demolition. Leigh and Olivier led a nationwide campaign to try to save the historic theatre, involving street marches and a protest in the [[House of Lords]]. A motion was carried against the Government in that house, but it was of no avail. However, the [[London County Council]] ordered that no further theatres would be demolished in central London without a planned replacement. An office building, St. James's House, was built on the theatre's site. It incorporates sculptured balcony fronts on each floor above the entrance. Four bas-relief panels by [[Edward Bainbridge Copnall]] depict the heads of Gilbert Miller, George Alexander, Oscar Wilde and the Oliviers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3256">'''Tampering''' can refer to many forms of [[sabotage]] but the term is often used to mean intentional modification of products in a way that would make them harmful to the consumer.  This threat has prompted manufacturers to make products that are either [[tamper resistance|difficult to modify]] or at least difficult to modify without warning the consumer that the product has been [[tamper evident|tampered with]].  Since the person making the modification is typically long gone by the time the crime is discovered, many of these cases are never solved.

The crime is often linked with attempts to [[extortion|extort]] money from the manufacturer, and in many cases no contamination to a product ever takes place.  Fraud is sometimes handled as a matter of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]], but actual modification of products is almost always a matter of [[criminal law]].

== Examples ==

=== 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders ===

Seven people died in this [[1982 Chicago Tylenol murders|incident]] in the [[United States]] after taking medication that had been contaminated with [[cyanide]].  One man was later convicted of extortion, but no one was convicted of the murders.  In 2009, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] announced that it was re-examining the case.  This event led to new requirements for [[tamper-evident]] seals on over-the-counter medications and changes in US tampering laws.

=== Foreign objects ===

Tampering cases often involve foreign objects in food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/enforcement/alerts/2005/sep/alliedbakeries|title=Allied Bakeries issue press statement on tampering incidents involving bread produced at Orpington plant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.qld.gov.au/News+and+Alerts/Media+Releases/2006/05/Investigation+continues+into+Top+Taste+food+tampering.htm|title=Investigation continues into Top Taste food tampering}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cases often focus on determining whether the contamination occurred during manufacturing, either accidentally or intentionally, or whether the claims made by the complaining customers are real or fraudulent.

=== Fraudulent claims ===

A famous case involving claims by customers that had tainted the products themselves was a series of claims in 1993 of needles found in [[PepsiCo|Pepsi]] products.  The manufacturer convincingly demonstrated that the contamination could not have taken place at the bottling plant, and several people were proven to have put the needles in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3289/is_n3_v163/ai_15312359|title=The Pepsi Challenge: managing a crisis - product tampering case at Pepsi Cola General Bottlers Inc.

==Plot==
Joe Warr ([[Clive Owen]]) is a British sports writer who lives in Australia with his second wife, Katy ([[Laura Fraser]]) and his young son Artie ([[Nicholas McAnulty]]). Katy is diagnosed with cancer and dies, forcing Joe to cope with the responsibilities of being a single parent.

Joe's teenage son from his first marriage, Harry ([[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]]), feels abandoned in the United Kingdom with his mother. Harry uses Katy's death as an opportunity to try to build a relationship with his father, coming to visit him in Australia. Although Harry is initially unnerved by the lack of discipline in the house, he eventually forms a strong bond with Artie, while struggling to foster a closer relationship with Joe.

When Joe is forced by work to leave his sons alone in the house for a night, local teenagers throw a party at the house against both boys' will. With the house ransacked, Harry flies back to England because he no longer feels safe living with Joe. Joe and Artie go after him. After much discussion, Joe convinces Harry to move to Australia on a permanent basis.

The trio return to Australia, and together shoulder the responsibilities of running the household without a female influence.

'''The Fame Ball Tour''' was the debut concert tour by American singer [[Lady Gaga]], in support of her debut studio album ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008). North American shows began in March, followed by dates in [[Oceania]] and a solo trek through Europe. Dates in Asia soon followed, as well as two performances at England's [[V Festival]] and two shows in North America that had been postponed from April. Gaga described the tour as a traveling museum show incorporating artist [[Andy Warhol]]'s pop-performance art concept. Tickets were distributed for charity also. Alternate versions of the show with minimal variations were planned by Gaga to accommodate different venues.

The show consisted of four segments, with each segment being followed by a video interlude to the next segment, and it ended with an encore. The set list consisted of songs from her debut album only. Gaga appeared on the stage in new costumes including an innovative dress made entirely of bubbles and premiered an unreleased song called "Future Love". An alternate set list with minor changes were performed after the first North American leg of the tour. The show has received  critical acclaim with critics complimenting her vocal clarity and fashion sense as well as her ability to pull off theatrics like a professional artist.

== Background ==
The tour was officially announced on January 12, 2009 through Gaga's official [[MySpace]] page. It was her first headlining tour; she has previously served as opening act for [[New Kids on the Block]]'s  [[New Kids on the Block: Live]] tour, as well as [[The Pussycat Dolls]]' [[Doll Domination Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1602622/20090113/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Gears Up For Pussycat Dolls Tour|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=January 13, 2009|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=November 4, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106162100/http://billboard.biz/|archivedate=January 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga stated,  "I consider what I do to be more of an [[Andy Warhol]] concept: pop performance art, multimedia, fashion, technology, video, film. And it's all coming together, and it's going to be traveling museum show."&lt;ref name="umg"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.universalmusic.com/artist-news/lady-gaga-announces-dates-for-the-fame-ball-tour|title=Lady GaGa Announces Dates For 'The Fame Ball' Tour|date=January 13, 2009|last=Reporter|first=UMG|accessdate=February 22, 2009|publisher=[[Universal Music Group]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717170317/http://www.universalmusic.com/artist-news/lady-gaga-announces-dates-for-the-fame-ball-tour|archivedate=July 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga started planning for the show while on the tour with The Pussycat Dolls.&lt;ref name="promise"/&gt; In an interview with MTV News, she described the tour as,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It's not really a tour, it's more of a traveling party. I want it to be an entire experience from [the] minute you walk in [the] front door to [the] minute I begin to sing. And when it's all over, everyone's going to press rewind and relive it again. [...] It's going to be as if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important. I want so much to make every depression dollar that everyone spends on my show worth it. And, yeah, I'm paying a lot for it&amp;nbsp;— out of my own pocket. But that's OK. I just don't care about money."&lt;ref name="promise"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1604302/lady-gaga-promises-life-changing-experience-with-fame-ball-tour/|title=Lady Gaga Promises 'Life-Changing Experience' With Fame Ball Tour|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=February 22, 2009|last=Montgomery|first=James|publisher=MTV|=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331182003/http://www.mtv.com/news/1604302/lady-gaga-promises-life-changing-experience-with-fame-ball-tour/|archivedate=March 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaga prepared three versions of her show to cater to different sizes of the venues she played. In an interview with ''Billboard'' she said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I am so mental and sleepless and excited for this tour, [...] This is so different than anything you've seen from me in the past year. What's fantastic about [the show] was I was able to plan it while I was on another tour that was on a much smaller scale, opening for the Dolls. This is going to be, like, the ultimate creative orgasm for me 'cause I'm ready to move on. I'm not restricted to a certain structure for my show anymore. No limitations. I'm free. [...] I want to have a clear schedule of the dimensions for each venue so that we can properly execute all the technology and visuals. I need to mentally prepare days in advance if things are going to be taken out; otherwise, I won't have a good show...Every show's gonna be an A show by the time I'm done screaming at everyone&amp;nbsp;– 'Hang it! Hang everything! Find a place to hang it!' That's gonna be my motto."&lt;ref name="ready"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/lady-gaga-ready-to-go-for-headlining-tour-1003946983.story|title=Lady GaGa Ready To Go For Headlining Tour|first=Gary|last=Graff|date=March 3, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2009|work=Billboard|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304173631/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/lady-gaga-ready-to-go-for-headlining-tour-1003946983.story|archivedate=March 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The set list consisted of songs from her debut album mainly, but some new songs like "Fashion" from the ''[[Confessions of a Shopaholic (film)|Confessions of a Shopaholic]]'' [[Confessions of a Shopaholic (film)#Soundtrack|soundtrack]] were also considered.&lt;ref name="ready"/&gt; In May, during an interview with ''[[Edmonton Sun]]'' Gaga announced that the tour would continue through European festivals in summer. She also declared plans for a bigger North American tour including Canada. Gaga explained that the show is supposed to be much bigger than the previous version. She said, "Oh, you have no idea, [...] The tour that we're about to announce is such a dream that I have to pinch myself almost every day to remind myself that it's happening."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/music/2009/05/27/9581996-sun.html|title=Going Gaga: Pop diva says she's into The Jonas Brothers, the MMVAs and her upcoming tour|last=Stevenson|first=Jane|date=May 27, 2009|work=[[Edmonton Sun]]|accessdate=May 29, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106162100/http://billboard.biz/|archivedate=January 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is mainly divided into four parts with the last part being the encore. The main show began with a video introduction called "The Heart" where Gaga appeared as alter-ego [[Andy Warhol|Candy Warhol]].&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-04-09/features/0904100056_1_concert-review-lady-media-gaga|title=Lady Gaga's larger-than-life stage show shrinks without a band|last=Piccoli|first=Sean|date=April 9, 2009|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|accessdate=April 15, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000704/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-04-09/features/0904100056_1_concert-review-lady-media-gaga|archivedate=July 25, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was shown dressing up and displayed the symbol of a pink heart on her T-shirt and said "My name is Lady Gaga, and this is my Haus".&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; The video was projected on a giant screen in front of the stage. As the video approached towards the end, a countdown from ten to one happened, Gaga's face was shown wearing the video sunglasses, and flames engulfed the screen as it dropped. Gaga appeared in the middle of the stage being surrounded by her dancers holding glass encrusted plates which camouflage them. She wore a futuristic black dress in geometric patterns with a triangular piece on her right breast and [[peplos|peplum]].&lt;ref name="dailyconcert"/&gt; DJ [[Space Cowboy (musician)|Space Cowboy]] was present at a corner, playing the backing music.&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; Gaga came out in the center as the plates rolled around and started singing "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]".&lt;ref name="chicago"/&gt;

The performance ends with continuous clicking of the camera. Gaga comes to the top of the pillar and sings a combination of "Starstruck" and "[[LoveGame]]" as she is joined by her dancers in tracks and jackets and hands Gaga her trademark disco stick. After "LoveGame", she talks a monologue about the year "3009". And says that "The kids came out of New York and shot the paparazzi." followed by saying "It was a thousand years before when the monster first entered the city, vanished for our hearts and for our brains and for our faces (referencing to the three video interludes of the tour)" and "we knew we could co-exist with this monster with our MUSIC!!! With our art and with our fashion. My name is Lady Gaga." and tells the crowd she feels "beautiful and dirty rich" and sang "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich". This leads to the end of the first part wherein a video introduction called "The Brain" starts with Gaga appearing again as Candy Warhol and brushing her hair.&lt;ref name="chicago"/&gt; After the video ends, Gaga appears on the stage in a black and white [[leotard]] with high-pointed "puff" shoulders and lightning shaped symbols,&lt;ref name="dailyconcert"/&gt; while riding on a similarly colored [[vespa]].&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; She then starts singing "The Fame". This is followed by a speech. Gaga said she's been "travelling the whole world, but when I get back, I can still smell the stench of greed." And then she performs "Money Honey" with the dancers who are wearing backpacks. "[[Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)]]" starts immediately, accompanied by hand-waving and Gaga wore a hat made of toppled [[dominoes]].&lt;ref name="dailyconcert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chicago"/&gt;

Gaga then leaves the stage only to appear shortly after in a dress completely made of plastic bubbles.&lt;ref name="chicago"/&gt; She sits in front of a glass piano and starts singing an acoustic version of "Poker Face". She sometimes puts her leg on the piano and even plays it with her stilettos. And then, thanks the audience and surprises them by performing an unreleased and new song called "Future Love" whose lyrics referenced far-off galaxies, mechanical hearts and constellations.&lt;ref name="Deacon 2009" /&gt; She was surrounded by a glowing mannequin while singing the song.&lt;ref name="hr"/&gt; The stage had a blue setting with mechanical fog. Gaga left for a costume change as the third video interlude titled The Face starts.

After the video ended, she then came on the stage wearing a [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] shaped dress with pointed shoulder pads and peplum. Her dancers were clad in [[Louis Vuitton]] Steven Sprouse printed trousers which matched Gaga's shoes.&lt;ref name="dailyconcert"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1176858/Madonna-Cyndi-Lauper-style-notes-Lady-Gaga-parades-latest-leotards-concert.html|title=Madonna and Cyndi Lauper take style notes as Lady Gaga parades latest leotards in concert|last=Abraham|first=Tamara|date=May 4, 2009|work=[[Daily Mail (UK)|Daily Mail]]|accessdate=May 13, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121205081536/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1176858/Madonna-Cyndi-Lauper-style-notes-Lady-Gaga-parades-latest-leotards-concert.html|archivedate=December 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backdrop changed to show blinking disco lights and Gaga stood in the center wearing her video sunglasses which display the line "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow". A remix of the [[Introduction (music)|intro]] for "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" started and Gaga was joined by her dancers on stage. When the song shifts to the bridge, Gaga once again is handed her disco stick and performs the bridge with it. The ending shifts to a remixed version of the song. Then Gaga and the dancers, joined by DJ Space Cowboy or DJ Nicodemus, take a bow in front of the audience. Gaga comes back with her dance to perform the encore. The [[encore (concert)|encore]] of the tour consisted of "Boys, Boys, Boys" and the original version of "Poker Face". Gaga was dressed in a khaki leotard embellished with crystals. She wore an admiral's cap and gloves on her hands, both were decorated with the word Gaga on them.&lt;ref name="dailyconcert"/&gt;

=== Changes from Oceania shows ===
Since the Fame Ball show in Auckland, New Zealand, Gaga performed a different setlist during the rest of the tour, involving outfit changes as well. "Paparazzi", "LoveGame", and "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" were performed in a similar, this time tinfoil tutu with a triangular piece. "The Fame" and "Money Honey" were then followed by "Boys Boys Boys"&amp;nbsp;– all three songs were performed in a glittering silver leotard with small pointy wings, riding a similarly colored vespa. "Just Dance" and "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" were performed in the yellow dress from the American leg of the tour. After performing "Brown Eyes" (replacing "Future Love") and "Poker Face" on the piano, Gaga closed the show with the album version of "Poker Face", wearing a nude corseted leotard embellished with crystals.&lt;ref name="Deacon 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/live-music-reviews/5833159/Lady-Gaga-at-the-O2-Academy-Brixton-review.html|title=Lady Gaga at the O2 Academy Brixton, review|last=Deacon|first=Michael|date=July 15, 2009|accessdate=March 10, 2013|work=The Daily Telegraph|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030084302/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/live-music-reviews/5833159/Lady-Gaga-at-the-O2-Academy-Brixton-review.html|archivedate=October 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The Fame Ball Tour received acclaim from critics. Whitney Pastorek from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave a mixed review of the concert saying, "Her onstage banter was at times a bit silly and the visuals occasionally lacking in coherent theme, but her voice was strong and refreshingly free of overbearing tracking vocals. For all her cocky bluster, perhaps the most undeniable aspect of Gaga's talent is this: The girl can, and does, sing." The show was described to be a "sartorial experimentation that it made Rocky Horror look like cotillion. One presumed the Lady approved&amp;nbsp;– and somewhere, to be sure, Andy Warhol stirred in his grave."&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/03/14/lady-gaga-live/|title=Lady GaGa live in L.A|first=Whitney|last=Pastorek|date=March 14, 2009|accessdate=March 16, 2009|work=Entertainment Weekly|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103123427/http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/03/14/lady-gaga-live/|archivedate=November 3, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheri Linden from ''[[Yahoo!]]'' gave a positive review of the concert saying "Gaga's first theater tour is a hot ticket&amp;nbsp;– and the Lady did not disappoint. Borrowing from [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Grace Jones]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Daryl Hannah]]'s "Blade Runner" replicant, Gaga put on a compelling show revolving around her mysterious persona, a trio of leather-jacketed dancers, multiple costume changes and props and a lone DJ providing musical accompaniment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS181405+26-Jan-2009+BW20090126|title=Lady GaGa wows with big beats, bluesy surprises|first=Sheri|last=Linden|date=March 15, 2009|accessdate=March 17, 2009|agency=Reuters|publisher=Yahoo!|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106162100/http://billboard.biz/|archivedate=January 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Muther from ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reviewed the concert in ''House of Blues'' and said "The combination of song and spectacle was crowd-pleasing and exhilarating.

Lynn Saxberg from the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' gave a positive review of the concert at Bronson Centre in Ottawa and said, "Accompanied by a DJ who also played a funky electric guitar, the curvy dynamo (Gaga and Space Cowboy) fronted one of wildest spectacles ever mounted at Bronson Centre, an action-packed circus of sound, lights, video images, fog and choreography. Though heavy on theatrics, there was no skimping on the music." She also commented on Gaga's fashion sense and style in her costumes by saying, "In an hour, Gaga proved her star power by packing in all her hits, displaying influences that ranged from Motown to 80s pop, and exhibiting a fearless fashion sense in several costume changes, none of which covered her bum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saxberg|first=Lynn|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Concert+Review+Lady+Gaga+Fame+Ball/1439756/story.html|title=Concert Review: Lady Gaga's Fame Ball|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=March 28, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815012102/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Concert+Review+Lady+Gaga+Fame+Ball/1439756/story.html|archivedate=August 15, 2009|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andy Downing from ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' was impressed by the show at [[House of Blues (Chicago)|House of Blues]] and said "The work is paying off. Just weeks into her first nationwide headlining tour, the 22-year-old New Yorker [...] already commands the stage like a seasoned pro."&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-03-26/entertainment/0903250453_1_lady-gaga-new-yorker-scepter|title=Lady Gaga delights|last=Downing|first=Andy|date=March 26, 2009|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=April 15, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717165911/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-03-26/entertainment/0903250453_1_lady-gaga-new-yorker-scepter|archivedate=July 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jill Menze from ''Billboard'' also gave a positive review for the performance and complimented songs like "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]", [[LoveGame]]", [[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]", "Boys, Boys, Boys" and the fame obsessed "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]". The reviewer also said that "[From] her chart success, Lady Gaga has proven herself to be an of-the-moment pop sensation.

Fortunately, this is a woman who knows how to lighten a mood: Within 10 minutes or so, she'd donned a flesh-colored leotard and a bedazzled admiral's cap and was rhyming 'boys in cars' with 'buy us drinks in bars."&lt;ref name="rollingstonereview"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gagas-fame-attracts-kanye-west-perez-hilton-to-l-a-show-20090316|title=Lady Gaga's 'Fame' Attracts Kanye West, Perez Hilton to L.A.

On March 13, 2009 Gaga was presented with a plaque from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] by social blogger [[Perez Hilton]] commemorating three million sales of her debut single "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]", during her performance at the Wiltern Theatre. This show was also attended by rapper [[Kanye West]].&lt;ref name="rollingstonereview"/&gt; Craig Rosen from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said that "Lady Gaga showed she's a serious contender to Madonna's crown Friday at the Wiltern. She might be a relative newcomer, but the artist born Stefani Joanne Germanotta commanded the stage with a royal air during her hourlong set, at times even sporting a glowing scepter."&lt;ref name="hr"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://login.vnuemedia.com/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003951569|title=Concert Review: Lady GaGa|last=Rosen|first=Craig|date=March 15, 2009|accessdate=April 8, 2009|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716111618/http://musique.fnac.com/a2727955/Lady-Gaga-Eh-eh-nothing-else-I-can-say-CD-single?Mn=-1&amp;Ra=-28&amp;To=0&amp;Nu=24&amp;Fr=0|archivedate=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Return of the King''''' (also known as '''''The Return of the King: A Story of the Hobbits'''''&lt;!--This is the full title card that is featured at the beginning of the film.--&gt;), is a 1980 [[animation|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[television film]] created by [[Rankin/Bass]] and [[Topcraft]]. The film is an adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King]]'', the third book in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

Due to marketing by [[Warner Bros.]], the film is often credited by fans as the unofficial sequel to [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s 1978 animated film ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', which is based on the first two volumes of the book. According to rumors, Rankin/Bass decided to do the project upon hearing that Bakshi's sequel finishing ''The Lord of the Rings'' was going to be left unmade. However, Rankin/Bass had always planned on making a sequel based on ''The Return of the King'' as their follow-up project to ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Braun, ''The Lord of the Films'' (ECW Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The special aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on Sunday, May 11, 1980. Critical and fan reaction to ''The Return of the King'' was lukewarm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tolkien-online.com/return-of-the-king.html Tolkien Online: The Return of the King] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120003610/http://www.tolkien-online.com/return-of-the-king.html |date=2011-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{further|The Return of the King#Plot summary|l1=Plot of the novel}}
During the 129th birthday celebration for [[Bilbo Baggins]] in [[Rivendell]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] begins his story with [[Samwise Gamgee]], his friend and companion, treading through [[Mordor]] as Ring-bearer in Frodo's absence, when Frodo is captive in the orc fortress of Cirith Ungol. During his journey, Sam ponders claiming the Ring himself; but rejects the idea and rescues Frodo.

Meanwhile, the wizard [[Gandalf|Gandalf the White]] and the hobbit [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] arrive at [[Minas Tirith]] to warn [[Denethor II|Denethor]], the Steward of the Throne, about the upcoming war—only to discover that the Steward has become insane and means to take his own life. Frodo and Samwise continue toward [[Mount Doom]] (eluding [[Ringwraith]]s and infiltrating a "battalion of orcs" in the process) only to be attacked by [[Gollum]]. As Sam holds Gollum off, Frodo reaches the Crack of Doom; but is subverted by the Ring. At the same time, Gondor's neighboring country, Rohan, helps it claim victory in the [[Battle of Pelennor Fields]], where King Théoden and the Witch-King of Angmar are slain. Upon his own arrival, [[Aragorn]] plans to confront [[Sauron]] at the gates of [[Mordor]]. Here, he quarrels with the [[Mouth of Sauron]] and the two armies prepare for battle.

After days of searching for Frodo in Mount Doom, Sam discovers Gollum and Frodo fighting over the Ring, which results in Gollum biting off Frodo's finger to claim it. While dancing with joy at the retrieval of his "Precious", Gollum falls into Mount Doom's magma chamber, taking the Ring with him, and Sauron perishes. Sam and Frodo are rescued by the [[Eagles (Middle-earth)|Eagles]] from the erupting Mount Doom. A few months later, [[Aragorn]] is crowned King of Gondor. The story concludes with Frodo agreeing to accompany Bilbo, Gandalf, and [[Elrond]] as they leave [[Middle-earth]]. He gives the [[Red Book of Westmarch|Red Book]] (consisting of Bilbo's memoirs with some spare pages) to Sam, assuring him that a good life is still in store for him. Gandalf assures them that hobbits shall someday have descendants among humans, to preserve their own existence; and the film terminates in Frodo's departure from the [[Grey Havens]].

==Production==
After the broadcast of ''The Hobbit'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], development and production began on ''The Return of the King'' at Rankin/Bass Productions in New York City under supervision of [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]] and [[Jules Bass]]. The film's original working title was '''''Frodo, The Hobbit II'''''. It was written by [[Romeo Muller]] with Rankin doing the script, designs for the characters and storyboards. The original cast from the previous film returned to reprise the voices of the characters with new actors joining them.

[[Orson Bean]] returned as the voice of the older [[Bilbo Baggins]], as well as that of the story's hero, [[Frodo Baggins]]. [[John Huston]] came back as well, as the wizard [[Gandalf]], and co-starring with them were: [[William Conrad]] as [[Denethor II|Denethor]], [[Roddy McDowall]] as [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Theodore Bikel]] as [[Aragorn]], and reprising his role of [[Gollum]], [[Brother Theodore]]. Rankin/Bass stalwart [[Paul Frees]] replaced the late [[Cyril Ritchard]] as the voice of [[Elrond]]; [[Casey Kasem]], best known for his role as [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', was [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], with [[Sonny Melendrez]] as [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]; [[Nellie Bellflower]] as [[Éowyn]]; and [[Glenn Yarbrough]] returned as principal vocalist, billed here as simply "the Minstrel of Gondor". [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] also served in the chorus. Once the character voices were recorded, along with background music by [[Maury Laws]] with Jules Bass writing songs and lyrics for the film, the animation production was done by [[Topcraft]] in Japan under supervision of Toru Hara, Tsuguyuki Kubo, Kazuyuki Kobayashi and other animation department members.

The film was going to air on ABC as a two-hour feature in the fall of 1979, but it was pushed back to May 1980, and the running time was changed from two hours to one hour and 38 minutes.

==Reception==
The film has garnered mixed reviews from modern sources. Charles Cassidy of [[Common Sense Media]] gave it a score of 3/5, and said, "Cartoon tale is darker, more complex than others in series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cassady|first1=Charles|title=The Return of the King (1980)|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-return-of-the-king-1980|website=commonsensemedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide gave it a C, and said, "Works even less well than ''The Hobbit'', which really is a children's story… overbearing folk-ballad soundtrack doesn't even gesture lyrically to Tolkien's poetry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greydanus|first1=Stephen|title=The Return of the King (1980)|url=http://decentfilms.com/reviews/returnoftheking1980|website=decentfilms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently holds a score of 67% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Return of the King|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1035462-return_of_the_king|website=rottentomatoes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
In the absence of an official sequel to Ralph Bakshi's ''The Lord of the Rings'', ''The Return of the King'' has come to be marketed by [[Warner Bros.]] as the final part of a loose animated Tolkien trilogy preceded by ''The Hobbit''. The middle film is very different in tone and character design, however, and the final two films do not join up seamlessly, as both omit various segments from ''[[The Two Towers]]'', most notably regarding the events in [[Shelob]]'s lair. Other omissions in the Rankin/Bass version include the characters of [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], [[Legolas]], [[Arwen]], and [[Saruman]]. [[Aragorn]] is present but he has very little dialogue or screentime.

==Home Media==
''The Return of the King'' was first released on [[VHS]] by [[Warner Home Video]] in 1991, and for the second time as part of the "Warner Bros. Classic Tales" video collection in 1996. The film is available on [[DVD]] since 2001, both individually and as a "boxed trilogy" with the Rankin/Bass's ''The Hobbit'' and Bakshi's ''The Lord of the Rings''. It was re-released on a Remastered Deluxe edition Blu-Ray and DVD on July 22, 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6446">'''Vasa syndrome''' is a term used in both [[management]] and [[marketing]] circles referring to problems in communication and management affecting projects, sometimes causing them to fail. Its basis lies with the Swedish 17th-century warship ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]'', a ship that sank on its maiden voyage because it was too unstable. 

The disaster of the ''Vasa'' has been interpreted by management experts to have been caused by problems with [[communication]], [[goal setting]], and [[adaptability]]. The sinking of the ''Vasa'' has also been used as an example for [[business manager]]s on how to learn from previous mistakes.&lt;ref name="VSarticle"&gt;{{Cite article| last=Kessler|first=E. H.| date=August 2001 |title=Vasa Syndrome: Insights from a 17th-century new-product disaster|journal=The Academy of Management Executive|pages=80-91|volume=15|number=3|doi=10.1109/EMR.2004.25008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vasa stern color model.jpg|thumb|A 1:10 scale model of the ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]'' on display at the [[Vasa Museum]] in Stockholm. The richly decorated stern is a sign of the great prestige that contemporary warship enjoyed as symbols of power and wealth.]]
{{main|Vasa (ship)}}
Vasa syndrome is inspired by the disastrous sinking of the Swedish warship ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]'' on its maiden voyage in 1628. The ''Vasa'' was one of the earliest examples of a warship with two full gun decks, and was built when the theoretic principles of shipbuilding were still poorly understood. The safety margins at the time were also far below anything that would be acceptable today. Combined with the fact that 17th century warships were built with intentionally high superstructures (to be used as firing platforms), this made the ''Vasa'' a risky undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustavus Adolphus]], king of Sweden 1611-1632, was waging war on the European continent in the 1620s commissioned the ship and insisted on swift completion of what was intended to be the pride of his fleet. Despite stability tests that showed that the ''Vasa'' was dangerously unstable, she was allowed to sail in August 1628. After less than 2&amp;nbsp;km, the ship was hit by a strong gust of wind and foundered in [[Stockholm]] harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous books and articles have been written about the ''Vasa''. For details of the sinking and the history of the ships in recent works, see Hocker (2011) and Cederlund (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The fiasco of ''Vasa's'' sinking has been ascribed largely to a supposed lengthening of the ship in mid-construction, constant meddling in minor details by the king (who was abroad waging war) and problems in communication between the various parties involved. Though these claims are today considered to have little support in contemporary sources, the idea of the ''Vasa'' as a flawed project has remained, especially in view of the fact that she did sink without ever firing a single shot in anger.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Hocker in Cederlund (2006), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

== In relation to marketing and product innovation ==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2010}}
Vasa syndrome refers to the need to stay realistic in terms of [[Strategic planning|strategy and project management]]. Also, organizations need to keep their [[goal]]s matched to their capabilities. Decision makers need to have access to unbiased (both internal and external) information and there needs to be processes in place that will allow for the flow of information throughout the organization. Internal sources allow firms to develop core competencies while external sources enable companies to develop a wider knowledge base and also to stay updated on new technologies. Through changes such as in [[Consumer choice|customer needs]], [[History of technology|advancements or breakthroughs in technology]], and changes in [[competition]], companies may find it necessary to alter their goals. If company coordination is poor, this can make the new goals confusing. This will affect product development at both the strategic and product management levels. It is important that organizations keep their goals and objectives clear so that their new projects and activities are not being doubted by company [[employee]]s.

Another problem that companies need to avoid is the desire to create a product on a shortened [[timeline]]. Although the idea of first-mover advantage seems like it would be worth speeding up the innovation process, "some researchers have pointed out the disadvantages of pioneering new technologies and concluded that it is sometimes better to go slower and be a follower instead of a pioneer".&lt;ref name="VSarticle"/&gt;

There were a number of examples which demonstrated the effects of the Vasa syndrome. For example, while handling the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], [[NASA]] failed to learn from previous mistakes and repeated many of the same mistakes in product development and project management which led to the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]]. The knowledge gained from the ''Challenger'' was not stored in the organizational memory and therefore was not available to create sufficient corrective mechanisms.&lt;ref name="VSarticle"/&gt;

Another example used to demonstrate the effect of the Vasa syndrome is [[Greyhound Lines]]'s attempt to design and implement a new computerized reservation system in 1998, modeled after a similar [[American Airlines]] system. Greyhound managers did not fully understand the technology and lacked sufficient knowledge of the bus industry. Because they attempted to copy a product they did not fully understand and a product that ended up being quite different from what they needed, the project was a complete failure.&lt;ref name="VSarticle"/&gt;
