'''Allothetic''' means being centred in people or places other than oneself, and is used in navigation models (e.g., of a rat in a maze) as in the phrase "allothetic map" to indicate that a global map, not orientated or centred on the subject was used, rather than [[idiothetic]], which means a navigation system centred on the subject.

The '''Amethyst Initiative''' is an organization made up of [[Higher education in the United States|U.S. college]] presidents and chancellors that in July 2008 launched a movement calling for the reconsideration of U.S. [[legal drinking age]], particularly the minimum age of 21. The [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984]]  requires all US states to raise their minimum age for purchase and public possession of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] to 21 or face a reduction in highway funds under the [[Federal-Aid Highway Act]]. The Amethyst Initiative was initiated by [[John McCardell]], founder of [[Choose Responsibility]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chooseresponsibility.org/cr-news/cr-announces-amethyst-initiative |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203175131/http://blog.chooseresponsibility.org/cr-news/cr-announces-amethyst-initiative/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-03 |title=Choose Responsibility announces Amethyst Initiative |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a former professor of history at [[Middlebury College]] in [[Middlebury, Vermont]] and current Vice-Chancellor of [[Sewanee: The University of the South]], and is currently supported by 136&lt;ref name="theamethystinitiative.org"&gt;http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/statement/&lt;/ref&gt; college presidents who signed a statement proclaiming, "It’s time to rethink the drinking age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theamethystinitiative.org |title=Amethyst Initiative front page|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828030259/http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/| archivedate= 28 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[[The Associated Press]] {{cite web|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jWXhmLxHPcv8q_iFiN7nLt7RP8CgD92L2IIO0 |title=College presidents seek debate on drinking age |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821225406/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jWXhmLxHPcv8q_iFiN7nLt7RP8CgD92L2IIO0 |archivedate=21 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] legend, [[amethyst]]s protected their owners from [[drunkenness]].

==Purpose==
The Amethyst Initiative states that, in their experience as university presidents, they have observed, "Alcohol education that mandates [[abstinence]] as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students," and therefore they urge lawmakers "to invite new ideas about the best ways to prepare [[Young adult (psychology)|young adult]]s to make responsible decisions about alcohol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/statement |title=Amethyst Initiative » Statement|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080902032504/http://www.theamethystinitiative.org/statement| archivedate= 2 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustavus Adolphus College]] President Jack R. Ohle said in a statement that the initiative is not about lowering the drinking age, but to open a debate on alcohol policies that affect young people and their choices about alcohol use. {{quotation|We need serious, sustained, unfettered debate about the drinking age and the reality of life on a college campus and how these two things are aligned. I signed the statement in hopes that it would encourage debate on our campus about the seriousness of drinking in general but more importantly the high-risk drinking that has become so common on college campuses today. As an educator, I feel a responsibility to encourage a discussion about responsibility. That responsibility rests with not only the students but with those of us who work to provide for their education, safety, and well being. We must engage in civil, informed, and dispassionate debate and consider all policy alternatives no matter how controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gustavus.edu/news/4168 |title=Statement from President Ohle Regarding Amethyst Initiative | publisher =  Gustavus Adolphus College |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Statement ==
The Amethyst Initiative states the following:&lt;ref name="theamethystinitiative.org"/&gt;

{{blockquote|'''It’s time to rethink the drinking age'''
In 1984 Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which imposed a penalty of 10% of a state's federal highway appropriation on any state setting its drinking age lower than 21.

Twenty-four years later, our experience as college and university presidents convinces us that…

'''Twenty-one is not working'''

A culture of dangerous, clandestine “binge-drinking”—often conducted off-campus—has developed.

Alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students.

Adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting, signing contracts, serving on juries and enlisting in the military, but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer.

By choosing to use fake IDs, students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law.

'''How many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition?'''

We call upon our elected officials:

To support an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21-year-old drinking age.

To consider whether the 10% highway fund “incentive” encourages or inhibits that debate.

To invite new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol.

We pledge ourselves and our institutions to playing a vigorous, constructive role as these critical discussions unfold.}}

==Public reaction==
The initiative's proposal has been criticized by several groups and government and industry officials, including [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD). Joining MADD's criticism are other groups, including the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]], the [[American Medical Association]], and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]].&lt;ref name="MADD PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-19-2008/0004869764&amp;EDATE= |title=MADD press release: Some University Presidents Shirk Responsibility to Protect Students from Dangers of Underage Drinking |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823001726/http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F08-19-2008%2F0004869764&amp;EDATE= |archivedate=23 August 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A spokesman for the [[Governors Highway Safety Association]] told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that university leaders "are really just punting on the issue and leaving the high school principals to deal with it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/20/AR2008082003626.html?sub=new "Lower drinking age is criticized"] (free registration required), ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, Amethyst Initiative's parent organization, Choose Responsibility, proposes that only [[high school graduate]]s should be eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/proposal |title=Choose Responsibility: drinking age proposals|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release, MADD argues that lowering the drinking age would result in greater numbers of fatal automobile accidents, and that the presidents are "looking for an easy way out of an inconvenient problem" and "misrepresenting science."&lt;ref name="MADD PR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madd.org/Article-Archive/2008/August/Article---Amethyst-Initiative-Underage-Drinking-Re.aspx |title=Mothers Against Drunk Driving - Amethyst Initiative Underage Drinking Response |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107101240/http://www.madd.org/Article-Archive/2008/August/Article---Amethyst-Initiative-Underage-Drinking-Re.aspx |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MADD cited former [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] Secretary, and current [[University of Miami]] president [[Donna Shalala]] statement that "maintaining the legal drinking age at 21 is a socially and medically sound policy that helps parents, schools and law enforcement protect our youth from the potentially life-threatening effects of underage drinking."&lt;ref name="MADD PR"/&gt;
 
[[Choose Responsibility]] argues that scientific evidence supports the Amethyst Initiative's views and goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17294/1/2638 |title=Legal Age 21 - National Minimum Drinking Age - FAQ with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17305/1/2643 |title=Drinking and Culture: International Comparisons with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17312/1/2648 |title=Drunken Driving Fatalities with citations|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refutes some of MADD's past claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/myths_realities_c/ |title=Myths and Realities about drinking with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/19785/1/2635/ |title=Not Convinced? |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanford Ungar, president of Goucher College and signee of the initiative argues that opponents should not fear because the Amethyst Initiative is about opening up the debate to improve alcohol policy. He brings about the misconception that they want to "polarize" the issue at hand, but instead wishes to find a better alternative to the current drinking age.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-span.org/video/?280945-7/changing-drinking-age-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Radley Balko, of ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]],'' wryly noted inconsistency opponents of the Amethyst Initiative believe that it "would be a "national tragedy" to, for example, allow 19- and 20-year-old men and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to have a beer in celebration of completing their tours of duty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Balko | first =Radley  | title =Amethyst Initiative's Debate on Drinking a Welcome Alternative to Fanaticism | newspaper =[[Fox News]] | date =August 25, 2008| url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,410283,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Balko also noted research showing that underage drinking laws had not reduced highway deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Miron | first =Jeffrey A.  |first2=Elina |last2=Tetelbaum |year=2009 |title=Does The Minimum Legal Drinking Age Save Lives? |journal=[[Economic Inquiry]] |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=317–336 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.2008.00179.x |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4319664/Miron_MinDrinkAgeLives.pdf?sequence=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, the Student Senate at the [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]] rejected a proposal to urge that university's chancellor to sign the Amethyst Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2008/11/13/news/z09drinking.txt "UW–L students say no to drinking age debate],''[[La Crosse Tribune]]'', Retrieved on 2008-12-15&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly the first such attempt by a student body to ask a president or chancellor to sign on, the measure at [[UW–L]] was defeated 14-19 after three weeks' debate.

A '''bed''' is a piece of [[furniture]] which is used as a place to [[sleep]] or [[Relaxation (psychology)|relax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/BEd|title=Bed|publisher= The Free Dictionary By Farlex| accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bed|title=Bed|publisher= Merriam-Webster| accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern beds consist of a soft, cushioned [[mattress]] on a [[bed frame]], the mattress resting either on a solid [[bed base|base]], often wood slats, or a sprung base. Many beds include a [[Box-spring|box spring inner-sprung base]], which is a large mattress-sized box containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress. Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized [[bassinet]]s and [[infant bed|crib]]s, to small beds for a single person or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two people. While most beds are single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as the [[murphy bed]], which folds into a wall, the [[sofa bed]], which folds out of a sofa, and the [[bunk bed]], which provides two mattresses on two tiers. Temporary beds include the inflatable [[air mattress]] and the folding [[camp cot]]. Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as the [[hammock]], which is considered one of the most comfortable places to rest while swaying side to side. Some beds are made especially [[animal furniture|for animals]].

Beds may have a [[Headboard (furniture)|headboard]] for resting against, and may have side rails and footboards (or "footers"). "Headboard only" beds may incorporate a "dust ruffle", "bed skirt", or "valance sheet" to hide the bed frame. To support the head, a [[pillow]] made of a soft, padded material is usually placed on the top of the mattress. Some form of covering [[blanket]]  is often used to insulate the sleeper, often [[bed sheet]]s, a [[quilt]], or a [[duvet]], collectively referred to as [[bedding]]. Bedding is the removable non-furniture portion of a bed, which enables these components to be washed or aired out.

==History==

=== Ancient history ===
[[Image:Tutankhamun's bed (Cairo Museum).jpg|thumb|[[Tutankhamun]]'s gilded bed from the 14th century BC]]
Early beds were little more than piles of [[straw]] or some other natural material (e.g. a heap of palm leaves, animal skins, or dried [[bracken]]). An important change was raising them off the ground, to avoid drafts, dirt, and pests. 23-5 million years ago, before the advent of humans, apes began creating beds composed of a sleeping platform including a wooden [[Pillows|pillow]]&lt;ref name="National Geographic News 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=Chimpanzees Make Beds That Offer Them Best Night's Sleep | website=National Geographic News | date=2014-04-18 | url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/04/140416-chimpanzees-trees-sleep-beds-animals-science/ | access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Bedding dated around to 3600 BC was discovered in [[Sibudu Cave]], South Africa.&lt;ref name="Wadley2"&gt;Wadley L, Sievers C, Bamford M, Goldberg P, Berna F, Miller C. (2011). [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6061/1388.full Middle Stone Age Bedding Construction and Settlement Patterns at Sibudu, South Africa]. Science 9 December 2011: Vol. 334 no. 6061 pp. 1388-1391&lt;/ref&gt; The bedding consists of [[sedges|sedge]] and other [[monocotyledon]]s topped with the leaves of [[Cryptocarya]] woodii Engl.&lt;ref name="Wadley2"/&gt; Beds found in a preserved northern Scottish village, which were raised boxes made of stone and likely topped with comfortable fillers, were dated to between 3200 BC and 2200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/skarabrae/furniture.htm |title=Skara Brae – The Furniture |publisher=orkneyjar.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] had high bedsteads which were ascended by steps, with bolsters or [[pillow]]s, and [[curtain]]s to hang around. The elite of Egyptian society such as its pharaohs and queens even had beds made of wood, sometimes gilded. Often there was a head-rest as well, semi-cylindrical and made of [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[wood]], or [[metal]]. Ancient Assyrians, [[Medes]], and [[Persian people|Persians]] had beds of a similar kind, and frequently decorated their furniture with inlays or appliques of metal, [[mother-of-pearl]], and [[ivory]].

[[File:Headrest with Two Images of the God Bes, ca. 1539-1190 B.C.E.,37.435E.jpg|thumbnail|Headrest with Two Images of the God [[Bes]], ca. 1539-1190 B.C.E.,37.435E, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The adjacent image showcases a headrest. Headrests like this were used in life to support the head while sleeping. They are also found supporting a mummy's head in the coffin. This headrest perhaps was made specifically for the tomb, since the offering prayer has been inscribed on the supporting column, although the prayer may have been added after the death of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headrest with Two Images of the God Bes|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/4039/Headrest_with_Two_Images_of_the_God_Bes|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest account of a bed is probably that of [[Odysseus]]: a [[charpoy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/charpoy|title=Definition of CHARPOY|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; woven of rope plays a role in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. A similar bed can be seen at the [[St Fagans National History Museum]] in [[Wales]]. Odysseus also gives an account of how he crafted the [[nuptial]] bed for himself and [[Penelope]], out of an ancient, huge [[olive tree]] trunk that used to grow on the spot before the bridal chamber was built. His detailed description finally persuades the doubting Penelope that the shipwrecked, aged man is indeed her long-lost husband. [[Homer]] also mentions the inlaying of the woodwork of beds with [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[ivory]]. The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] bed had a wooden frame, with a board at the head and bands of hide laced across, upon which skins were placed. At a later period the bedstead was often [[Wood veneer|veneer]]ed with expensive woods; sometimes it was of solid ivory veneered with [[tortoiseshell material|tortoise-shell]] and with [[silver]] feet; often it was of [[bronze]]. The pillows and coverings also became more costly and beautiful; the most celebrated places for their manufacture were [[Miletus]], [[Corinth]] and [[Carthage]]. Folding beds, too, appear in the famous [[Ancient Greek pottery|Ancient Greek vase paintings]].

[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mattresses]] were stuffed with [[reed (plant)|reeds]], [[hay]], or [[wool]]. [[Feathers]] were used towards the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], when custom demanded luxury. Small cushions were placed at the head and sometimes at the back. The bedsteads were high and could only be ascended by the help of steps. They were often arranged for two people, and had a board or railing at the back, as well as the raised portion at the head. The counterpanes were sometimes very costly, generally [[imperial purple|purple]] embroidered with figures in [[gold]]; and rich hangings fell to the ground masking the front. The bedsteads themselves were often of bronze inlaid with silver, and [[Elagabalus]] had one of solid silver. In the walls of some houses at [[Pompeii]] bed niches are found which were probably closed by curtains or sliding partitions. [[Ancient Romans]] had various kinds of beds for repose. These included:
*''lectus cubicularis'', or chamber bed, for normal sleeping
*''lectus genialis'', the marriage bed, it was much decorated, and was placed in the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] opposite the [[door]]
*''lectus discubitorius'', or table bed, on which they ate&amp;mdash;for they ate while lying on their left sides&amp;mdash;there usually being three people to one bed, with the middle place accounted the most honorable position
*''lectus lucubratorius'', for studying
*and a ''lectus funebris'', or ''emortualis'', on which the dead were carried to the [[pyre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{1728}} {{cite web |url= http://www.futoncreations.com/reference.html |title=BED |publisher=History of Science and Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-classical history===
The ancient [[Germans]] lay on the floor on beds of [[leaf|leaves]] covered with [[skin]]s, or in a kind of shallow [[Chest (furniture)|chest]] filled with leaves and [[moss]]. In the early [[Middle Ages]] they laid [[carpets]] on the floor or on a [[bench (furniture)|bench]] against the wall, placed upon them mattresses stuffed with [[feathers]], [[wool]], or [[hair]], and used skins as a covering. Curtains were hung from the ceiling or from an [[iron]] arm projecting from the wall.&lt;ref name="furniturestyles1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furniturestyles.net/medieval/ |title=Medieval Furniture &amp; Home Decor |publisher=furniturestyles.net |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appear to have generally lain [[naked]] in bed, wrapping themselves in large [[linen]] sheets which were stretched over the cushions.
[[File:Southampton Medieval Merchant's House bedroom.jpg|thumb|left|Southampton [[Medieval Merchant's House]] bedroom]]
In the 12th century, luxury increased and bedsteads were made of wood much decorated with inlaid, carved, and painted ornamentation. They also used folding beds, which served as couches by day and had cushions covered with silk laid upon [[leather]]. At night a linen sheet was spread and pillows placed, while silk-covered skins served as coverlets. The [[Carolingian]] [[manuscripts]] show metal bedsteads much higher at the head than at the feet, and this shape continued in use until the 13th century in France, many cushions being added to raise the body to a sloping position. In 12th-century manuscripts, the bedsteads appear much richer, with inlays, carving, and painting, and with embroidered coverlets and mattresses in harmony. Curtains were hung above the bed and a small hanging [[oil lamp|lamp]] is often shown.

In the 14th century the woodwork became of less importance, generally being entirely covered by hangings of rich materials. [[Silk]], [[velvet]], and even cloth of [[gold]] were frequently used. Inventories from the beginning of the 14th century give details of these hangings lined with [[fur]] and richly embroidered. It was then that the [[Four poster bed|Four poster]] bed (also known as a ''tester bed'') made its first appearance, the bed being slung from the ceiling or fastened to the walls, a form which developed later into a room within a room, shut in by double curtains, sometimes even to exclude all drafts. The space between bed and wall was called the ''ruelle'', and very intimate friends were received there. The 14th century is also the time when feather beds became highly prized possessions.&lt;ref name="furniturestyles1"/&gt;

In the 15th century beds became very large, reaching {{convert|7|to|8|ft}} by {{convert|6|to|7|ft}}. The mattresses were often filled with pea-shucks, straw, or feathers. At this time great personages were in the habit of carrying most of their property about with them, including beds and bed-hangings, and for this reason the bedsteads were for the most part mere frameworks to be covered up; but about the beginning of the 16th century bedsteads were made lighter and more decorative, since the lords remained in the same place for longer periods.

&lt;!-- Anchor|Chambre de parade is the target of an incoming redirect. Please do not remove unless the target of the redirect is changed. --&gt;
In the 17th century, which has been called "the century of magnificent beds", the style ''a la duchesse'', with [[Four poster bed|tester]] and curtains only at the head, replaced the more enclosed beds in France, though they lasted much longer in England. [[Louis XIV]] had an enormous number of sumptuous beds, as many as 413 being described in the inventories of his palaces. Some of them had embroideries enriched with [[pearls]], and figures on a silver or golden ground. The great bed at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] had crimson velvet curtains on which "The Triumph of Venus" was embroidered. So much gold was used that the [[velvet]] scarcely showed. 
[[File:Compiègne Château 09.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon I]]'s bed]]

In the 18th century feather pillows were first used as coverings in Germany, which in the fashions of the bed and the curious etiquette connected with the bedchamber followed France for the most part. The beds were ''a la duchesse'', but in France itself there was great variety both of name and shape. The custom of the "[[Lit de justice|bed of justice]]" upon which the [[king of France]] reclined when he was present in [[parliament]], the [[princes]] being seated, the great officials standing, and the lesser officials kneeling, was held to denote the royal power even more than the [[throne]].

[[Louis XI]] is credited with its first use and the custom lasted until the end of the [[French monarchy|monarchy]]. In the ''chambre de parade'', where the ceremonial bed was placed, certain persons, such as [[ambassadors]] or great [[lord]]s, whom it was desired to honour, were received in a more intimate fashion than the crowd of [[courtiers]]. At [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] women received their friends in their beds, both before and after [[childbirth]], during periods of [[mourning]], and even directly after [[marriage]]—in fact in any circumstances which were thought deserving of congratulation or condolence. During the 17th century this curious custom became general, perhaps to avoid the tiresome details of etiquette. Portable beds were used in high society in France until the end of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''. The earliest of which mention has been found belonged to [[Charles the Bold]]. They had curtains over a light framework, and were in their way as fine as the stationary beds.

Iron beds appear in the 18th century; the [[advertisements]] declare them as free from the [[insects]] which sometimes infested wooden bedsteads. Elsewhere, there was also the closed bed with sliding or folding shutters, and in England—where beds were commonly quite simple in form—the [[four poster bed|four poster]] was the usual citizen's bed until the middle of the 19th century.

==Bed sizes==
{{main|Bed size}}

Bed sizes vary considerably around the world, with most countries having their own standards and terminology. While the "double" size appears to be standard among English speaking countries, based on the [[imperial measurement]] of 4&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in by 6&amp;nbsp;ft 3&amp;nbsp;in (137&amp;nbsp;cm x 190&amp;nbsp;cm), the sizes for other bed types tend to vary. [[Mainland Europe]]an sizes differ, not merely because of the use of the [[metric system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.translatorscafe.com/tcterms/en-US/question.aspx?id=67933|title=TCTerms - Standard-double vs. Standard-twin (English)|website=www.translatorscafe.com|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1950s, the United States bedding industry introduced a new size: the king size.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pboPT5H_K8TuggfN7KDUAw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Even Beds Go King-Size"] ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1954, p.128, bottom of page.&lt;/ref&gt; A king-sized bed differs from the other sizes in implementation, as it is not common to have a king-sized box spring; rather, two smaller box-springs are used under a king-sized mattress. It is a common misconception that in a US "standard" or "Eastern king", the box springs are identical in size to a "twin extra-long"; however, "twin extra-long" mattresses next to each other add up to {{convert|78|in|cm}} wide instead of the {{convert|76|in|cm}} width that is standard for an "eastern king". Another size variant in the United States is the "California king", which measures {{convert|72|x|84|in|cm}} long (narrower but longer than the standard king).

What is referred to as a "single bed" in many parts of the world may also be known in US terminology as a "twin bed."  In some countries, a "twin bed" may also be used to describe one of two single beds in the same room. As another example, in some cultures, the "full mattress" is referred to as a "master size bed."

==Notable examples==
[[File:Bed of Ware.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Bed of Ware]], one of the largest beds in the world]]

One of the largest beds in the world is the [[Great Bed of Ware]], made in about 1580. It is {{convert|3.26|m|ft}} wide, {{convert|3.38|m|ft}} long. The bed is mentioned by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[Twelfth Night]]''. It is now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (V&amp;A) in [[London]]. Another bed in the V&amp;A is the [[Golden Bed]] created by [[William Burges]] in 1879.&lt;ref name='VABed'&gt;{{cite web| url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O61210/the-golden-bed-bed-burges-william/|title=The Golden Bed|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum| accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, an Indian [[Maharajah]] had a bed made of solid silver. At each corner of the bed there was a life-sized statue of a naked woman holding a fan. When the Maharajah lay on the bed, his weight started a mechanism that made the women wave their fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are many varieties of beds:
*An [[adjustable bed]] is a bed that can be adjusted to a number of different positions. Most hospital beds are adjustable, so that a patient can have different parts of her body elevated for medical reasons. Some people have adjustable beds in private homes. Some adjustable beds are designed for couples; they use two separate mattresses and adjustment mechanisms. This permits one partner to be lying flat to sleep while the other has the head and shoulders elevated to watch television or read. Couple adjustable beds also permit partners with different medical conditions to select a mattress positioning that best suits them.
*An [[air mattress|air bed]] uses an air-inflated mattress, sometimes connected to an electric air pump and having variable, firmness controls. The portable version of an air bed can also be rolled up and packed; so is meant for travel or temporary guest use.
*A [[bassinet]] is a bed specifically for newborns.
*A [[box-bed]] is a bed having the form of a large box with wooden roof, sides, and ends, opening in front with two sliding panels or shutters; often used in cottages in Scotland: sometimes also applied to a bed arranged to fold up into a box.
*A [[Bed frame#Brass beds|brass bed]] has a frame constructed from brass. A brass-plated bed is a cheaper bed of iron with a thin covering of brass, which with time peels off and the iron is exposed.
*A [[bunk bed]] is two or more beds one atop the other. Bunk beds are used for adults in military barracks and in some ski lodges. Bunk beds are used for children and teens in summer camps. Some inexpensive [[hostel]]s provide bunk beds for guests. Bunk beds are used for children in private homes.
*A [[bunk bed#loft bed|loft bed]] is similar to a bunk bed, except there is no lower bunk. This leaves space underneath for storage, other furniture, a desk etc.
*A captain's bed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/captains+bed?s=t|title=Captain’s bed|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as a "captain bed", "chest bed", or "cabin bed") is a platform bed with drawers and storage compartments built in underneath.
*A [[camp bed]] (also "cot") is a simple, temporary, portable bed used by armies and by campers. Cots are also used to provide a sleeping surface for [[refugee]]s and other [[homelessness|homeless]] people during disasters, floods, or other crises.
*A [[canopy bed]] is similar to a [[four poster bed]], but the posts usually extend higher and are adorned or draped with cloth, sometimes completely enclosing the bed.
*A curtained bed is a luxury bed with curtains.
*A [[daybed]] is a [[couch]] that is used as a seat by day and as a bed by night. Usually it has pop up trundle which is used as bed in the night.
*A [[futon]] is a traditional style of Japanese bed using a mattress on a wooden frame. Futons are also available in a larger Western style which can fold halfway for sitting. Futons were traditionally made with cotton, but in the 2000s, many futons include synthetic foam.
*A [[four poster bed]] is a bed with four posts, one in each corner, that support a [[Four poster bed|tester]].
*A [[hammock]] is a piece of suspended fabric or netting, used on ships and in some homes. 
*A hideaway bed, invented by [[Sarah E. Goode]] in response to the needs of apartment-dwellers, folds up into another piece of furniture, such as a shelf or desk, when not in use.
*A [[hospital bed]] is specifically designed to facilitate [[convalescence]], traditionally in a [[hospital]] or [[nursing home|nursing facility]], but increasingly in other settings, such as a private residence. Hospital beds are typically adjustable, so that the head or feet can be raised or lowered. Modern hospital beds commonly have wheels to assist in moderate relocation, but they are larger and generally more permanently placed than a [[gurney|trolley (US: gurney)]]. The "hospital bed" is also a common unit of measurement for the capacity of any type of inpatient medical facility, though it is just as common to shorten the term to "bed" in that usage (e.g. ''The hospital has 250 beds...'').
*An [[infant bed]] (also "crib" or "cot") is a small bed specifically for [[baby|babies]] and [[infant]]s.
*An [[Bed frame#Iron beds|iron bed]], developed in the 1850s, is constructed of iron and steel.

*A [[pallet (furniture)|pallet]] is a thin, lightweight mattress.
*A [[platform bed]] is a mattress resting on a solid, flat raised surface, either free-standing or part of the structure of the room.
*A roll-away bed is a bed whose frame folds in half and rolls in order to be more easily stored and moved. This is used in different settings, including [[hotel]]s for either free or a nominal fee per night, where more people than expected may need to sleep in the same room, e.g. 5 people in a hotel room for 4 (two twin beds).

For a nominal fee, the mattress vibrates for a duration of time. Alternatively it is a modern bed which vibrates by use of an off-centre motor. It is controlled by electronics for varying time and amplitude settings and is used therapeutically to ease back pains or as an erotic aid.
*A [[waterbed]] is a flexible plastic mattress full of water. The plastic container needs a strong frame around it.

==Frames==
{{main|Bed frame}}
[[Bed frame]]s, also called bed steads, are made of wood or metal. The frame is made up of head, foot, and side rails. For heavy duty or larger frames (such as for queen- and king-sized beds), the bed frame also includes a center support rail. These rails are assembled to create a box for the mattress or mattress/box spring to sit on.

Types include:
* [[platform bed|platform]]&amp;nbsp;–  typically used without a box spring
* captain&amp;nbsp;–  has drawers beneath the frame to make use of the space between the floor and the bed frame
* waterbed&amp;nbsp;–  a heavy-duty frame built specifically to support the weight of the water in the mattress (Mainly used on larger models)

Although not truly parts of a bed frame, headboards, footboards, and bed rails can be included in the definition. [[Headboard (furniture)|Headboard]]s and footboards can be wood or metal. They can be stained, painted, or covered in fabric or leather.

Bed rails are made of wood or metal and are attached to a headboard and footboard. Wooden slats are placed perpendicular to the bed rails to support the mattress/mattress box spring. Bed rails and frames are often attached to the bed post using knock-down fittings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitechapel-ltd.com/hist/bed_hardware.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060312175925/http://www.whitechapel-ltd.com/hist/bed_hardware.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-03-12 |title=Historical Guide: Bed Hardware |publisher=whitechapel-ltd.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.home-improvement-and-financing.com/bed-rail-fastener.html |title=Bed Rail Fastener Options |publisher=home-improvement-and-financing.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; A knock-down fitting enables the bed to be easily dismantled for removal. Primary knock-down fittings for bed rails are as follows:

* Pin-and-hook fastener. A [[Mortise and tenon|mortise]] or slot is cut vertically in the bedpost. Pins are inserted horizontally in the bed post so that the pins perpendicularly intersect the mortise. For example, if one looked in the mortise, one might see part of one horizontal pin at the bottom of the mortise and a part of a second pin toward the top of the mortise. Hooks are installed at the end of the rail. Usually these hooks are part of a plate that is attached to the rail. The hooks then are inserted into the bed post mortise and hook over the pins.
* Plate-and-hook fastener. Instead of pins inserted horizontally into the bedpost, an eye plate (post plate) is installed on the bedpost. The hooks are installed on the rail, either as surface mount or recessed. Depending on the hardware, the bedpost may require a mortise in order to allow the hooks to fasten to the plate. This is also referred to as a keyhole fastener, especially if the connector is more of a "plug" than a "hook".
* Bed bolts ("through-bolts") are a different means of a knock-down connection. A hole is typically drilled through the bedpost. The bolt head is inset and covered with a plug. In the rail, a dowel nut or other type of nut receives the bolt. The springs are made from metal, which are swirled for maximum comfort

Safety rails, or [[cot sides]], can be added to the sides of a bed (normally a child or elderly person's bed) to stop anyone falling out of the sides of the bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sleepcompare.com/bed-frames/best-platform-bed-frames/#Bed_Safety_Rails |title=Bed Safety Rails |publisher=sleepcompare.com |accessdate=15 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A safety rail is normally a piece of wood that attaches to the side rails on one or both sides of the bed. They are made so that they can be easily removed when no longer required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2781">'''Capital punishment''' is a legal penalty in the '''[[Maldives]]''', but the last execution (as of May 2018) was carried out in 1954, when the country was a British colony.

The only legal method of execution is [[lethal injection]], although [[hanging]] has been proposed. Crimes punishable by death include murder, adultery, apostasy, terrorism and treason - however the punishment is not mandatory for any crime. The death penalty is a legal punishment for defendants over seven years old.

Currently, it is believed that there are about 17-20 individuals under a sentence of death in the Maldives, 13 of which were sentenced in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Maldives |title=The Death Penalty in Maldives |website=Deathpenaltyworldwide.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, convicted murderer Hussain Humaam Ahmed was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection in the Maldives, but the execution was postponed following international calls for clemency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deathpenaltynews.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-maldives-1st-execution-in-60-years.html |title=Death Penalty News: The Maldives: The 1st execution in 60 years - help stop this |website=Deathpenaltynews.blogspot.com |date=2016-07-11 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late July, 2017, another execution date was scheduled for Ahmed, and the Maldives stated that they intended to carry out his execution and the executions of two others in September 2017. For unknown reasons, the executions ended up not being carried out.&lt;ref&gt;https://international.la-croix.com/news/trouble-in-paradise-maldives-says-it-will-carry-out-execution/5642&lt;/ref&gt; A Maldives government spokesperson stated the delays in executions would be resolved by October 8, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://maldivesindependent.com/politics/maldives-death-penalty-delays-will-be-resolved-by-october-8-132897&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the date passed with no executions being carried out.

The Maldives voted against the [[United Nations moratorium on the death penalty]] in 2007 and 2008, then voted in favor of the moratorium in 2010, then abstained from voting in 2012 and 2014, and then voted against it again in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Maldives&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, it was widely reported that the Maldives will bring back the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/maldives-remains-uk-human-rights-priority-country&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/south-asia/2018/07/17/european-union-warns-maldives-of-sanctions&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CHI Building.jpg|thumb|This is the Catholic Health Initiatives headquarters in Inverness, CO.]]

'''Catholic Health Initiatives''' (CHI) is a national nonprofit health system with headquarters in [[Englewood, Colorado]]. CHI is a nonprofit, faith-based health system formed in 1996 through the consolidation of four Catholic health systems. It is one of the nation's largest healthcare systems.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==History==
CHI began operation July 1, 1996.

The founding systems were the following:
* Catholic Health Corporation of Omaha, NE
* Franciscan Health System of Aston, PA
* Sisters of Charity Health Care Systems of Cincinnati, OH
Expansion:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholichealthinitiatives.org/chi-history|title=Our History|accessdate=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* September 1997, The Sisters of Charity of Nazareth Health System, Nazareth, KY, consolidated with Catholic Health Initiatives, adding nine acute care facilities in three states to the system. 
* March 1998, The Sisters of St. Francis of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Hankinson, North Dakota, transfer sponsorship of a hospital and eight clinics to CHI. 
* September 2010, Consolidated Health Services, a home care service provider with 30 locations in Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana, joins CHI as the basis of a national home care business line.  Home health is later re-branded as CHI Health at Home. 
* May 2013, St. Luke’s Episcopal Health System, a six-hospital system based in Houston, Texas, joins CHI as St. Luke’s Health System. The organization includes outpatient clinics throughout the Houston metro area and affiliations with Baylor College of Medicine, Kelsey-Seybold Clinic, Texas Heart Institute, Texas Children’s Hospital and MD Anderson Cancer Center. 
* April 1, 2014, Mercy Health of Hot Springs Arkansas signed a definitive agreement to transfer ownership of Mercy Hot Springs hospital and medical group to CHI St. Vincent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arkansas-catholic.org/news/article/3824/Mercy-Hot-Springs-hospital-now-St-Vincent-Hot-Springs|title=Mercy Hot Springs hospital now St. Vincent Hot Springs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* June 2014, CHI St. Luke’s Health Memorial (formerly Memorial Health System), Lufkin, Texas, joins CHI. 
* October 2014, CHI St. Alexius Health, Bismarck, North Dakota, becomes a direct affiliate of CHI, adding St. Alexius Medical Center and two critical access hospitals to the system. 
* November 2014, Sylvania Franciscan Health becomes part of CHI, adding St. Joseph Health System in the Brazos Valley region of Texas; Franciscan Living Communities in Kentucky and Ohio; and three hospitals in eastern Ohio to the system 
* January 2016, Brazosport Regional Health System, Lake Jackson, Texas, joins CHI St. Luke’s Health, Houston. 
* December 2017, Dignity Health and CHI announce a definitive agreement to merge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/leadership/catholic-health-initiatives-and-dignity-health-merge#|title=Catholic Health Initiatives and Dignity Health to Merge|last=Philip Betbeze|date=2017-12-07|work=Health Leaders Media|accessdate=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Catholic Health Initiatives has expanded since 2011, entering new states and expanding in existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Melanie Evans| title = CHI's financial results show its growth comes with costs beyond the price of buying| work = Modern Healthcare| accessdate = 2016-11-05| date = 2014-12-20| url = http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20141220/magazine/312209963}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHI also acquired the health insurer QualChoice, but was unsuccessful in its ownership; QualChoice is currently for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Bob Herman| title = Catholic Health Initiatives to divest health plan operations| work = Modern Healthcare| accessdate = 2016-11-06| url = http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160630/NEWS/160639998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and size==
Colorado-based CHI is one of the nation's largest health systems, operating in 18 states and comprising 104 hospitals&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chiannualreport.net/&lt;/ref&gt;, including four academic health centers and major teaching hospitals and 30 critical-access facilities; community health-services organizations; accredited nursing colleges; home-health agencies; and other facilities that span the inpatient and outpatient continuum of care.

In fiscal year 2014, CHI provided $910 million in charity care and community benefit - a nearly 20% increase over the previous year - for programs and services for the poor, free clinics, education and research. Charity care and community benefit totaled more than $1.7 billion with the inclusion of the unpaid costs of Medicare. The health system, which generated revenues of almost $13.9 billion (FY 2014), has total assets of $21.8 billion.

==Controversy==
In January 2013, the hospital's defense lawyers provoked controversy by arguing against a [[wrongful death]] lawsuit that unborn fetuses should not be [[fetal personhood|classed as persons]], contradicting [[Catholic Church and abortion|Catholic doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomasic|first=John|title=In malpractice case, Catholic hospital argues fetuses aren't people|url=http://coloradoindependent.com/126808/in-malpractice-case-catholic-hospital-argues-fetuses-arent-people|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=The Colorado Independent|date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the case was submitted to the three bishops of Colorado for review, they issued a joint statement which reiterated their commitment to defending human dignity against attacks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2013/bishops-to-review-handling-of-wrongful-death-suit-against-catholic-hospital.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Hospital of Yaoundé''' (In French, '''Hôpital Central de Yaoundé''' - HCY) is a hospital in the city of [[Yaoundé]], Cameroon founded in 1933.&lt;ref name=SelfOverview/&gt;
It is Cameroon’s largest hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Simon Pierre Tchoungui]] (1916-1997), the former prime minister of East Cameroun, was medical superintendent of the hospital in 1960 before being appointed Minister of Health in 1961.&lt;ref name="DeLanceyMbuh2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeLancey|first1=Mark D.|last2=Mbuh|first2=Rebecca Neh

The hospital was originally a day facility, but since has gone through several structural changes and now offers 24/7 care.
Treatment of [[HIV/AIDS]] is one of the main programs, with the [[day hospital]] following about 12,000 people who are living with HIV and 3,600 who have ARV treatment.&lt;ref name=SelfOverview/&gt;
The hospital is one of the two teaching hospitals in Yaoundé, the other being the [[University Teaching Hospital of Yaounde]].
A study of births at these two hospitals between 2002 and 2007 showed increasing frequency of triple pregnancies due to use of fertility treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/cmch/article/viewFile/71478/60421

The hospital has the busiest trauma center in the city.
A study of admission records in 2007 showed a total of 6,274 trauma patients admitted to the emergency ward.
Of these, 71% were male, with a mean age of 29 years.  60% of the injuries were from traffic accidents and 22.5% were from assault. 
Based on the catchment area, this is a high rate of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (CBC), Campbelltown Branch''' is a heritage-listed former restaurant, offices and bank building and now medical centre located at 263 Queen Street, [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]] in the [[City of Campbelltown (New South Wales)|City of Campbelltown]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was designed by Mansfield Brothers and built from 1874 to 1881. It is also known as '''Old CBC Bank'''; '''CBC Bank'''. The property is privately owned. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045430|CBC Bank|hr=00499|fn=EF14/4520; S90/3118; HC 33294|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Permanent European settlement in the Campbelltown area had begun in 1809 as an alternative to the flood-prone Hawkesbury district. Work on a road from [[Sydney]] to [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] was started in 1811. It was opened in August 1814 and was soon extended further south to [[Appin, New South Wales|Appin]]. This road, variously known as Campbelltown Road, [[Appin Road]] or the Sydney Road, passed through Campbelltown. The section through the town was called the High Street until the last decade of the 19th century when it was renamed Queen Street.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-64&gt;Orwell &amp; Peter Phillips, 1995, vol.2, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The land on which the Queen Street cottages stand was part of a [[land grant|grant]] of {{convert|140|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} to Joseph Phelps in 1816. He had been working the land for some years before receiving formal title to it. Phelps was one of the farmers of [[Airds, New South Wales|Airds]] and Appin who subscribed funds for a Sydney courthouse in July 1813. His grant was seized, possibly as soon as it was formally issued, by the Provost Marshal, William Gore in lieu of payment by Phelps of debts totalling [[Pound sterling|₤]]170. The land was auctioned in January 1817 to William Bradbury for ₤100 plus twelve cattle and the grain produced from the crop growing on the land.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-64/&gt;

Immediately north of Phelps' grant, Assistant Surveyor [[James Meehan]] had informally reserved {{convert|175|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} for a village (AMCG, 1994 say "in 1815".) In 1816 most of the land in the area was granted, leaving a portion of {{convert|175|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} unalienated, and surrounded by several grants.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-66&gt;AMCG, 1994, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reserved land was formally declared a town by [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]] in December 1820 and named Campbelltown in honour of his wife (Elizabeth)'s family.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-64/&gt;

William Bradbury (1774-1836) a native of Birmingham, was transported to NSW aboard the ''[[Guildford (1810 ship)|Guildford]]'' in 1812. His wife Elizabeth remained in England but his daughter, Mary (1797-1852) followed her father to Australia in 1815. Bradbury had no other children in NSW, though he established a relationship with a woman named Alice and in April 1836 married a Campbelltown widow, Catherine Patrick, nee Acres ({{circa|1801}}-1883). Bradbury died two months later.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-64/&gt;

Governor Macquarie visited Campbelltown in January 1822. He and his party ate a "hearty" breakfast at 'Bradbury's', indicating that Bradbury had built an inn. This was probably the inn later known as the Royal Oak, on the western side of the High Street. Macquarie noted in his journal that 'Bradbury is building a very good two storey brick house on his own farm and on a very pretty eminence immediately adjoining Campbell-Town as an inn for the accommodation of the public, and having asked me to give his farm a name, I have called it Bradbury Park. In 1826 Bradbury Park House was considered by [[William Dumaresq]], inspector of roads and bridges, as the best building in Campbelltown when he reported on buildings suitable for military use.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-64/&gt;

As the main street of Campbelltown, High Street or Sydney Road and later Queen Street, was at the edge of town, one side of the street was not within the town boundary while the other was. Canny traders soon realised that either side of the main road was as good as the other and leased or bought land from the grantees bordering the town proper. By the 1840s more than a few shops and hotels occupied the western side of the High Street. The coming of the railway in 1858 also aided in securing the commercial focus of the town on Queen Street.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-66/&gt;

The Queen Street terraces were identified by Helen Baker (Proudfoot) in the early 1960s as a unique group of two-storey late Georgian vernacular buildings which were considered to form the only surviving late-1840s streetscape within the [[County of Cumberland, New South Wales|County of Cumberland]]. The buildings were acquired by the Cumberland County Council and its successors, the [[State Planning Authority]] and Department of Planning, to ensure their preservation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-64/&gt;

===CBC Bank===
Joseph Phelps was granted {{convert|140|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} adjoining the future site of Campbelltown in 1816. His was one of a group of the first grants made that year. The subject property (the future 263 Queen Street) represents a small portion of the original grant. Phelps did not develop the portion of the grant that is the subject of this study. In fact no plan shows any development before 1881.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-66/&gt;

Phelps increased his holdings to {{convert|170|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} in 1817, and that year conveyed the larger property to Thomas Clarkson. It passed through several hands up to 1870, however it appears was not developed in any way. It was presumably used for agricultural purposes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-66/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2564&gt;AMCG, 1994, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Parker, blacksmith, bought the subject property as part of a larger parcel in 1870 from Charles Morris. Parker owned the adjoining property (south side) and appears to have worked and resided on the property. What use, if any, he made of the subject site is unclear (Parker's house can be seen to the left of the bank in an 1881-83 photograph).&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-66/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2564/&gt;

===The Commercial Banking Company===
The [[Commercial Banking Company of Sydney|Commercial Banking Company]] (CBC) of Sydney opened its first Campbelltown office in leased premises, McGuannes House at 286 Queen Street (across the road from no. 263) in 1874, with George L. Jones as manager. McGuannes House is separately listed on the State Heritage Register. It is owned by the Department of Environment &amp; Planning and is at present leased as a doctor's surgery.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2566/&gt; AMCG (1994, 14) states that CBC bought the property (263 Queen Street) from Samuel Parker (not Morris) in 1876 and had the present building built in 1881. AMCG states that the bank's first permanent manager from 1874 was A. J. Gore, who served until he retired in 1904.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2564/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2566&gt;Branch Manager's report, 100/85, 26 March 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank moved into its own premises at 263 Queen Street in 1881. This building (built between 1874 and 1881) was designed by the Mansfield Brothers who were important Victorian architects employed by the CBC Bank on a number of projects&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2566/&gt; designing many bank chambers, examples surviving in many country towns.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2564/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2566/&gt; It is a fine and restrained Italianate style rendered and painted building symmetrically designed about a small portico.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2566/&gt;

The bank sold a portion of the land it bought from Parker in 1880. The land was purchased in the name of the Queen for a new post office. That building was completed the same year as the CBC chambers.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2564/&gt;

In 1959 the bank sold off another portion of its 1876 purchase to the Commowealth of Australia, presumably for the creation of a telephone exchange.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2564/&gt;

The banking chamber has been altered, but it is understood that the building still contains a stone domed vault, and the original staircase and other joinery. There is a large yard behind the bank which contains a stable/ coach house, now used as a garage.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2566/&gt;

The CBC sold the bank cahmbers and property at 263 Queen Street in 1986, moving to new premises (as the [[National Australia Bank]]). In recent times the former bank building at 263 Queen Street has been leased by a Pancake restaurant and is today (1994) used as the offices for a local newspaper.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2568&gt;AMCG, 1994, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The bank complements the old Post Office next door in period, scale and style and together these make an important contribution to this area of Queen Street.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-499-2566/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Press release, [[Michael Knight (Australian politician)|Michael Knight]], MLA for Campbelltown, 19 April 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

CBC Bank was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-499/&gt;

'''C. Daniel Batson''' (born March 15, 1943&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Public Records Index'', Vol 1 &amp; 2 (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.), 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[United States|American]] social psychologist. He has two doctoral degrees, in theology (from [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]) and psychology (from [[Princeton University]]'s [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]]). Batson obtained his doctorate under [[John M. Darley|John Darley]] and taught at the [[University of Kansas]]. He retired in 2006 and now is an emeritus professor in the psychology department at the University of Tennessee. He is best known for his contributions to three fields: the social psychology of [[altruism]], [[empathic concern]], and [[psychology of religion]].

==On altruism==
Batson has become well known for the [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis, which states that "feeling empathy for [a] person in need evokes motivation to help [that person] in which these benefits to self are not the ultimate goal of helping; they are unintended consequences" (Batson &amp; Shaw 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;114). The theory, initially proposed as an explanation of the so-called "empathy-helping relationship", implies that pure [[altruism]] is possible and that [[psychological egoism]] is false. Indeed, Aronson, Wilson and Akert (2005) have described Batson as "the strongest proponent that people often help others purely out of the goodness of their hearts" (Aronson et al., 2005, p362). Batson has published [[experimental research]] to support the empathy-altruism hypothesis against various alternative egoistic explanations. Critics who believe that all apparently altruistic actions are actually egoistic have attacked the theory (see, for example, the competing [[Negative-state relief model|negative state relief model]]). More on the empathy-altruism hypothesis can be found in a number of social psychology textbooks, including Brehm and Kassin (1996).

Batson is also the co-author of an often-cited study examining bystander intervention in theology students (Darley &amp; Batson, 1973). In this study, students' religious views and personalities did not correlate with their willingness to help a needy bystander. Rather, the best predictor of whether a student would stop to help was how hurried they felt. Since some students were assigned work on the [[parable of the Good Samaritan]], and the assignment had no effect on their behavior, the study has been cited as evidence that exposure to the parable does not make people more helpful. There has been debate about whether Batson used appropriate statistics to analyze this study (Greenwald, 1975).

==On empathy==
Work in [[social psychology]] has for a long time been interested in the distinction between imagining the other and imagining oneself, and in particular in the emotional and motivational consequences of these two perspectives. A number of Batson's studies documented that focusing on another's feelings may evoke stronger [[empathic concern]], while explicitly putting oneself into the target's shoes induces both empathic concern and [[personal distress]]. In one such study, Batson and colleagues investigated the affective consequences of different perspective-taking instructions when participants listened to a story about Katie Banks, a young college student struggling after the death of her parents.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C. D., Early, S., &amp; Salvarini, G. (1997). Perspective taking: imagining how another feels versus imagining how you would feel. Personality &amp; Social Personality Bulletin, 23, 751-758.&lt;/ref&gt; This study demonstrated that different instructions had distinct effects on how participants perceived the target’s situation. Notably, participants imagining themselves in Katie’s place showed stronger signs of discomfort and personal distress than participants focusing on her responses and feelings, or participants instructed to take an objective, detached point of view. Also, both perspective-taking instructions differed from the detached perspective by resulting in higher empathic concern. This may help explain why observing a need situation does not always produce [[prosocial behavior]]: if perceiving another person in an emotionally or physically painful circumstance elicits personal distress, the observer may tend not to fully attend to the other's experience and as a result may not behave sympathetically.

Batson recently collaborated with [[University of Chicago]] neuroscientist [[Jean Decety]] on a study using [[functional neuroimaging]] to investigate the neural underpinnings of [[empathy]] and personal distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1162/jocn.2007.19.1.42 | last1 = Lamm | first1 = C. | last2 = Batson | first2 = C.D. | last3 = Decety | first3 = J. | year = 2007 | title = The neural substrate of human empathy: effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 42–58 | pmid = 17214562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While being scanned, participants watched a series of video clips of patients undergoing painful medical treatment. They were asked to either put themselves explicitly in the shoes of the patient (imagine self), or to focus on their feelings and affective expressions (imagine other). The behavioral data confirmed that explicitly projecting oneself into an aversive situation leads to higher personal distress whereas focusing on the [[emotional]] and behavioral reactions of another's plight yields greater empathic concern and less personal distress. The neuroimaging data were consistent with this finding and provided insights into the neural correlates of these distinct behavioral responses. The self-perspective evoked stronger hemodynamic responses in brain regions involved in coding the motivational-affective dimensions of pain, including bilateral insular cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, the amygdala, and various structures involved in motor preparation. The [[amygdala]] plays a critical role in the evaluation of actual or potential threats. Imagining oneself in a painful and potentially dangerous situation thus might have triggered a stronger fearful and/or aversive response than imagining someone else in the same situation.

==On religion==
Batson's most famous{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} contribution to the psychology of religion is his argument that the traditional distinction made by [[Gordon Allport]] (Allport &amp; Ross, 1967)&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W., &amp; Ross, J. M. (1967). Personal religious orientation and prejudice. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 5, 432-433.&lt;/ref&gt; between intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientations{{clarify|date=May 2013}} does not exhaust all possible religious orientations; rather, he believes it is important to refer to what he calls Quest, a form of religiosity that views questions and their answers as of equal importance (Batson &amp; Schoenrade, 1991a; 1991b). This view has been controversial, and critics have questioned whether Quest really correlates with any other variable germane to religiosity. Batson has also written about religious experiences, defending a four-stage model based on [[Graham Wallas]]'s four-stage model of problem-solving in the psychology of [[creativity]] (Batson, Schoenrade &amp; Ventis, 1993).

The '''Establishment of [[World Health Organization]]''' occurred on 7 April 1948, when its new constitution was ratified by a twenty-sixth nation. Its establishment followed a period of discussions and consultation following [[World War II]] and the formation of the [[United Nations]], of which it formed part.

==History==
An international sanitary conference was held in Venice in 1892, prompted in part by the spread of [[Asiatic cholera]] earlier in that century.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"/&gt; The first international organization to cover this area was the [[Pan-American Sanitary Bureau]] in 1902, followed by the ''[[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]]'' in Paris in 1909. The [[League of Nations Health Organization]] was established following the First World War inside the [[League of Nations]] framework, although it did not subsume other health organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=League of Nations Health Organization |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/health_org_1931.pdf |year=1931 |format=pdf |publisher=League of Nations Information Section, Geneva (digitised by WHO) |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts were hampered by the Second World War, during which [[UNRRA]] also played a role in international health initiatives.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"/&gt;

During the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]], references to health had been incorporated into the [[United Nations Charter]] at the request of [[Brazil]]. It similarly passed a declaration that an international health body would be set up, co-authored by Brazil and China.&lt;ref name="shimkin"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The World Health Organization |first=Michael B. |last=Shimkin|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=104 |number=2700 |date=27 September 1946 |pages=281–283 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |jstor=1674843 |doi=10.1126/science.104.2700.281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[India]]n politician [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] also gave his opinion in favour of starting WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1948.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization |page=54|format=PDF|title=Chronicle of the World Health Organization, April 1948|accessdate=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1946, the [[Economic and Social Council of the United Nations]] helped draft the constitution of the new body. The draft constitution began to be signed by representative of 61 countries in June 1946, to come into force when ratified by 26 countries. Until that happened, an Interim Commission of 18 countries would prepare.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"&gt;{{cite journal |title=World Health Organization |journal=The British Medical Journal |volume=2 |number=4570 |date=7 August 1948|pages=302–303 |publisher=BMJ Publishing Group |jstor=25364565 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4570.302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word "world", rather than "international", emphasised the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"/&gt; The constitution of WHO was developed from four documents, submitted by the French, British, United States and Yugoslav governments. There was a common consensus that membership should not be limited to members of the United Nations and to this effect other countries were allowed to send observers to the drafting process.&lt;ref name="shimkin"/&gt; The International Health Conference met between 19 June and 22 July 1946, attended by representatives of all 51 members of the UN, 13 non-member countries, 3 [[Allied Commission]] and 10 international organizations. Dr. [[Thomas Parran, Jr.|Thomas Parran]] served as president of the conference. The two most discussed issues were the role of the [[Soviet Union]] (which accepted a place) and the integration of other international organizations, which was agreed and would be managed. The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 61 countries by 22 July 1946, which an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' described as "an historic day". It thus became the first specialised agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed.&lt;ref name="shimkin"/&gt; Its constitution formally came into force on the first [[World Health Day]] on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf|format=PDF|title=Chronicle of the World Health Organization, 1947|accessdate=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer was authorized by a Resolution of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="UN_ARES61I"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-61(I) |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=1 |resolution_number=61 |accessdate=14 November 2007|title=Establishment of the World Health Organization |date=14 December 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Office International d'Hygiène Publique'' was incorporated into the Interim Commission of the World Health Organization on 1 January 1947.&lt;ref name="iriye2002"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Iriye|first=Akira|title=Global Community: The Role of International Organizations in the Making of the Contemporary World|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=2002|isbn=0520231279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting [[World Health Assembly]] finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of US$5&amp;nbsp;million (then GBP£1,250,000) for the 1949 year. Dr. [[Andrija Stampar]] was the Assembly's first president, and Dr. [[G. Brock Chisholm]] was appointed Director-General of WHO, having severed as Executive Secretary during the planning stages.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"/&gt; Its first priorities were [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, [[maternal health|maternal]] and [[child health]], nutrition and environmental hygiene. Its first legislative act was concerning the compilation of accurate statistics on the spread and morbidity of disease. It pushed quickly to establish five regional offices to complement is central staff in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"/&gt; The logo of the World Health Organization features the [[Rod of Asclepius]] as a symbol for healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.org.ph/ |title=World Health Organization Philippines |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank A. Gough''' (June 28, 1872 – August 15, 1938) was an American Orthodontist who graduated from [[Angle School of Orthodontia]]. He was the first person to open an Orthodontic practice in the borough of Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frederick|first1=Noyes|title=Frank A. Gough|journal=Angle Orthodontist|date=1938|url=http://www.angle.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/0003-3219(1938)008%3C0353%3AIM%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Angle Orthodontist Society History|url = http://www.angle.org/page/history|website = www.angle.org|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
He was born in 1872 in [[North East, Pennsylvania|North East]], Pennsylvania. He initially was interested in working in civil service but later became interested in dentistry. He attended [[New York University College of Dentistry]] and obtained his dental degree in 1896. He was the 4th dentist ever to get a licence to practice Dentistry in the State of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Around 1900 he became interested in Orthodontics and applied to Angle School of Orthodontia in St. Louis. He eventually attended the school with his classmates [[Lloyd Steel Lourie]], [[Herbert A. Pullen]] and [[Richard Summa]]. After his orthodontic course, Dr. Gough stayed in Hornellsville, Pennsylvania to assist a dentist for some time. He then moved to [[Brooklyn]] where he started his orthodontic practice in an office of his home. He was the first person to open a practice of Orthodontics in Brooklyn. He practiced here for next 30 years.

He was also a Fellow of American College of Dentists and Edward H. Angle Society of Orthodontists. In 1927, Dr. Gough joined [[Brooklyn Rotary Club]] and he became the treasurer, Vice-President, and President in 1926. He was also a member of New York State Crippled Children's Society and [[New York Mausoleum Association]].

Dr. Gough was married to Allie B. Ellsworth who died in 1937. After that incident, Dr. Gough suffered a coronary thrombosis and gave up his practice and his organization activities. He then returned to his home in [[North East, Pennsylvania|North East]], Pennsylvania and eventually died in 1938. They had two daughters: Dr. Helen Gough who practiced in Brooklyn as an Orthodontist and Mrs. Charles Gough who lived in New York.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5166">'''Global Accessibility Awareness Day''' (GAAD) is an [[Awareness Day|awareness day]] focusing on digital access and inclusion for the more than one billion people with disabilities and impairments. It is marked annually on the third Thursday of May.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/background.php|title=Background|last=Asuncion|first=Jennison|date=|website=Global Accessibility Awareness Day|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next GAAD is Thursday, May 16, 2019.

In 2018, in addition to a number of virtual events marking GAAD, there were events open to the public in at least nineteen countries on six continents.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/events.php|title=2018 Events|last=Asuncion|first=Jennison|date=|website=globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Global Accessibility Awareness Day website, '''"'''The purpose of GAAD is to get everyone talking, thinking and learning about digital (web, software, mobile, etc.) access/inclusion and people with different disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/|title=Global Accessibility Awareness Day|last=Asuncion|first=Jennison|date=|website=Global Accessibility Awareness Day|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local Global Accessibility Awareness Day events sometimes showcase how people with [[disabilities]] use the web and digital products using [[assistive technologies]], or assist people creating technology products in taking into consideration the needs of certain disabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Global Accessibility Awareness Day launched in May 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was inspired by a blog post by Los Angeles-based web developer Joe Devon. Devon worked with Jennison Asuncion,  an accessibility professional from Toronto, to co-found GAAD.

'''Globe rupture''' is an [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologic]] condition when the integrity of the outer membranes of the [[eye]] are disrupted by blunt or [[penetrating trauma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|798223|Globe Rupture}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually resulting from a full-thickness injury to the [[cornea]] or [[sclera]]. It may also result from damage caused by chemicals such as strong acids ([[Hydrochloric acid]], [[Sulfuric acid]], [[Hydrofluoric acid]] etc.) or industrial chemicals such as [[Lewisite]]. 

During a globe rupture, the outer membranes of the eye are completely or partially compromised, and the [[vitreous humour|vitreous]] and/or [[aqueous humour]] drain through the site of the rupture, causing the eye to 'deflate'. 

If not treated swiftly, severe damage can result. In many cases, globe ruptures are untreatable without [[Enucleation of the eye|enucleating]] the affected eye socket and replacing the eye with an [[ocular prosthesis]]. However, with modern diagnostic techniques, surgical approaches, and rehabilitation, in many cases eyes can be salvaged with retention of vision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5488">Since the first HIV/AIDS case in the [[Lao People’s Democratic Republic]] (PDR) was identified in 1990, the number of infections has continued to grow. In 2005, [[UNAIDS]] estimated that 3,700 people in Lao PDR were living with HIV.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/ane/laos_profile.pdf "Laos: HIV/AIDS Health Profile"]. [[USAID]] (March 2008). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==

Lao PDR’s currently faces a concentrated epidemic with an adult [[HIV]] prevalence of 0.1 percent. The low HIV prevalence does not necessarily indicate low risk. Moreover, the HIV-prevalence rate is increasing. Because of its geographical location in the heart of the [[Mekong region]], injecting drug use, and unsafe sexual practices, Lao PDR is in danger of an expanded epidemic. Nearly 5 percent of injecting drug users (IDUs) were found to be HIV-positive in 2005. Although only 0 to 1.1 percent of sex workers were HIV-infected in 2000, a 2004 survey of the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among service women found that chlamydia/gonorrhea prevalence was 45 percent in the capital Vientiane, 43.6 percent in the border province of Bokeo, and 27.9 percent in the southern province of [[Champasak Province|Champasak]], indicating the vulnerability of these women to HIV.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Lao PDR is undergoing rapid socioeconomic changes, including increased international tourism, leading to sexual behaviors that may place some [[Laotians]] at increased risk for HIV infection. For instance, a report cited by [[UNAIDS]] found increasing sexual activity among young men in [[Vientiane]] in 2004, nearly 60 percent of whom reported having multiple partners in the first six months of the year and more than one-third of whom reported paying for sex. Many of Lao PDR’s men who have sex with men ([[Men who have sex with men|MSM]]) also report having sex with women. Women are considered to be particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS because of their low literacy, education and health status. Women whose husbands have multiple sex partners and visit sex workers are particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Compounding Lao PDR’s vulnerability to an expanding HIV epidemic is a low level of knowledge about the disease among the general population. According to one study reported in the [[World Bank]]-sponsored Lao PDR Gender Profile, 23 percent of respondents did not know that HIV was transmissible by blood, and more than half did not know that it could be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Implementing programs to increase knowledge and awareness is difficult in Lao PDR because the country is home to 47 different ethnic groups with multiple native languages and a variety of cultures.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]], Lao PDR had 69 new [[tuberculosis]] (TB) cases per 100,000 people in 2005, one of the highest incidence rates in the region. Although HIV-TB co-infection is relatively low, with only 0.7 percent of new TB cases occurring among HIV-infected individuals, the country is in danger of a combined epidemic. HIV-TB co-infection poses a challenge to providing treatment and care for both diseases.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

==National Response==
The Lao PDR government initiated its response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 1992, when participants at an AIDS conference agreed that the spread of HIV was inevitable and would likely occur via young male urban or international migrants who returned to their villages and via women who became commercial sex workers out of economic necessity. The [[National Committee for the Control of AIDS]] is in charge of policy matters related to HIV/AIDS prevention and control. The committee consists of 14 members from 12 government ministries. The [[National Action Plan on HIV/AIDS/STIs]] for 2006–2010 focuses on achieving universal access to treatment, care and support.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

The [[National Socioeconomic Development Plan]] for 2006–2010 addresses HIV/AIDS, indicating the government’s commitment to expanding the national response. Since implementing the plan, national authorities have worked to target people most likely to be exposed to the disease; scale up prevention, treatment, care and support; and improve strategic information. Activities to fight HIV/AIDS, including [[Behavior Change Communication]] (BCC) interventions, peer education, life skills training, and a 100 percent condom use program, have been integrated into Lao PDR’s general development programs. The [[Ministry of Education (Laos)|Ministry of Education]] is promoting HIV/AIDS and sex education by training school principals and teachers in these areas, so they can transfer their knowledge to students. The objective is to reduce [[risky sexual behavior]] to help keep down the number of new HIV infections in the country. According to UNAIDS, as of 2005, 49 percent of HIV-infected women and men were receiving antiretroviral therapy.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Lao PDR receives support in its response to HIV/AIDS from various international donors, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Global Fund approved a sixth-round grant from Lao PDR to scale up HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment in 2006.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

'''Hapnes Boman Skeie syndrome''' is a rare genetic disorder first described by Sveln Hapnes et al. in 1980. It is characterized by [[subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] [[angiolipoma]]s around the wrists, knees, and ankles.&lt;ref name="clingen"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hapnes| first1=Sveln A.| last2=Boman| first2=Helge| last3=Seele| first3=Sverre O.| journal=Clinical Genetics| volume=17| issue=3|date=March 1980| title=Familial angiolipomatosis| pages=202–208|doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.1980.tb00133.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as "anomalous insertion of extensor tendons of fingers",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Genetic &amp; Rare Diseases Information Center| accessdate=2012-10-31| title= Tendons, extensor, of fingers, anomalous insertion of| url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/2597/Tendons_extensor_of_fingers_anomalous_insertion_of.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; a name derived from the condition that the tendons of the fingers are attached in such a way that the fingers cannot open or close normally. Though the tumors extend deeply into the muscle tissue, joints, and tendons, the tumors did not invade these structures.&lt;ref name="clingen"/&gt;

'''He Xiangu''', birth name '''He Qiong''', is a [[Chinese mythology|Chinese mythological]] figure and one of the [[Eight Immortals]] in the [[Taoism|Taoist]] pantheon. While she is often seen as the only female among the Eight Immortals, the sex of [[Lan Caihe]], another of the Eight Immortals, is somewhat ambiguous. He Xiangu is believed to have lived in the [[Tang dynasty]] and was born in either [[Lingling District]], [[Yongzhou]], [[Hunan]] or [[Zengcheng District]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]].

==Legend==
According to the ''Xian Fo Qi Zong'' (仙佛奇蹤), He Xiangu was the daughter of He Tai (何泰), a man from [[Zengcheng District|Zengcheng]], [[Guangdong]]. At birth, she had six long hairs on the crown of her head. When she was about 14 or 15, a divine personage appeared to her in a dream and instructed her to eat powdered [[mica]] so that her body might become etherealised and immune from death. She did as instructed, vowed to remain a virgin, and gradually decreased her food intake.

[[Wu Zetian]] once sent a messenger to summon He Xiangu to the imperial court, but she disappeared on the way there.

One day during the Jinglong era (707–710 CE) in the reign of [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Emperor Zhongzong]] of the [[Tang dynasty]], she ascended to Heaven in broad daylight and became an immortal.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Liexian Zhuan]], ii, 32, 33''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction==
He Xiangu's [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] flower improves one's health, mental and physical. She is depicted holding a lotus flower, and sometimes with the musical instrument known as ''[[sheng (instrument)|sheng]]'', or a ''[[fenghuang]]'' to accompany her. She may also carry a bamboo ladle or fly-whisk.

==Modern depictions==
In the television show ''[[Jackie Chan Adventures]]'', He Xiangu was shown to be the Immortal who sealed away [[List of Jackie Chan Adventures characters#Tso Lan|Tso Lan, The Moon Demon]].

}}The '''Hospital Employees' Union''' (HEU), founded in 1944 at [[Vancouver General Hospital]], is now the oldest and largest [[trade union]] for hospital workers and health care specialists in [[British Columbia]]. The HEU represents 46,000 members across the public, non-profit and private health sectors. It is also a member in the [[British Columbia Federation of Labour]] and the [[Canadian Union of Public Employees]] (CUPE).&lt;ref name=aboutHEU&gt;{{cite web|title=About HEU|url=http://www.heu.org/about_heu|website=heu.org|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the HEU was judged to have conducted an illegal strike in BC hospitals. Although members worked fewer hours for higher rates than the national average, and had generous vacation benefits (five weeks after 10 years of employment and up to nine weeks after 25 years), there was dispute with the provincial government for privatization of in-house support services in BC health authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milke|first1=Mark|title=Submission: Labour unions have their place, but not in a monopoly|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/labour-unions-have-their-place-but-not-in-a-monopoly/article26240371/|accessdate=9 January 2016|work=Globe and Mail|date=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hospital Employees' Union eventually won a related [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case in 2007. The court's decision established that union bargaining is a constitutional right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big win for unions as ruling says bargaining protected == B.C. health unions welcome victory at Supreme Court of Canada|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/big-win-for-unions-as-ruling-says-bargaining-protected-1.632216|accessdate=9 January 2016|work=CBC News|date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court win led to a negotiated settlement with the provincial government which paid up to $85 million to former HEU members who lost their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leyne|first1=Les|title=Les Leyne: Province, BCTF await today's court decision|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/opinion/columnists/les-leyne-province-bctf-await-today-s-court-decision-1.1869362#sthash.4HfblqwP.dpuf|accessdate=9 January 2016|work=Victoria Times-Colonist|date=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judy Darcy]], elected as provincial [[Member of the Legislative Assembly#Canada|Member of the Legislative Assembly]] for [[New Westminster (provincial electoral district)|New Westminster]] in 2013, had been HEU's business manager from 2005 to 2011. Darcy was appointed Opposition Health Critic by the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]].

In 2015, the HEU advocated against proposed privatization of laundry services by [[Interior Health Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sthankiya |first= Anita|date=2015-11-24 |title= Hospital Employees' Union Finds No Validity for Privatizing Laundry Services|url=https://www.kelownanow.com/watercooler/news/news/Kelowna/15/11/24/Hospital_Employees_Union_Finds_No_Validity_for_Privatizing_Laundry_Services/|newspaper=Kelowna Now |location= Kelowna|access-date=2016-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another reprieve for Interior Health laundry workers|url=http://infotel.ca/newsitem/another-reprieve-for-interior-health-laundry-workers/it25331|accessdate=9 January 2016|work=infotel.ca|date=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HEU also applied in 2015 to be an intervenor in a Supreme Court of Canada case involving the [[British Columbia Teachers' Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherlock|first1=Tracy|title=BCTF, province file arguments in Supreme Court of Canada|url=http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2015/09/17/bctf-province-file-arguments-in-supreme-court-of-canada/|accessdate=9 January 2016|date=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology''' ('''CSIR-IGIB''') is a scientific [[research institute]] devoted primarily to biological research. It is a part of [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR), India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csir.res.in Council of Scientific and Industrial Research India Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927141436/http://csir.res.in/ |date=2015-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was founded in 1977 as the [[Center for Biochemical Technology]] with a primary focus on biochemical research, but has since shifted its research focus to integrative biology.

==Location==
The Institute has two campuses in Delhi. The North Campus is older of the two campuses and is in the campus of [[Delhi University]], on Mall Road opposite to [[Jubilee Hall, Delhi|Jubilee Hall]]. 
The new campus is in South Delhi, on Mathura Road at Sukhdev Vihar. 

== History ==

IGIB was established in 1977 as the [[Center for Biochemical Technology]] (CBT). The Functional Genomics Unit was established in 1998 with the focus shifting from chemical to genomics research. The institute was renamed "Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology" in 2002.

== Achievements ==
In 2009, a team at the institute sequenced the [[genome]] of the wild-type [[zebrafish]], with about 1.7 billion base pairs. This made the fish, which is native to the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region, the first [[vertebrate]] to have its whole genome sequenced in India, as previously Indian scientists had only sequenced bacteria and plant genomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.igib.res.in Zebrafish Genome Webpage] 'Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology' (IGIB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Decoding-the-Genome-Mystery/485122 Decoding the Genome Mystery] [[Indian Express]], 5 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, scientists at IGIB performed the first re-sequencing of a human genome in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/videoie.php?videoId=201 Indian Scientists decode human genome] ''[[Indian Express]]'', 10 December 2009 {{deadlink|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite journal | author=Patowary| title=Systematic analysis and functional annotation of variations in the genome of an Indian individual. | journal=Human Mutation | volume=33| issue=7 | year=2012| pages=1133–40 | doi= 10.1002/humu.22091 | pmid=22461382 | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.22091/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vinodscaria.rnabiology.org/indian-genome Compilation of news articles and Press releases on Indian Genome], 10 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also collaborated on decoding the first Sri Lankan &lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.igib.res.in/SriLankan/ Sri Lankan genome ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Dissanayake| title=The Sri Lankan Personal Genome Project: an overview. | journal=Sri Lanka Journal of Biomedical Informatics | volume=1| issue=2 | year=2012| pages=4–8 | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.sljol.info/index.php/SLJBMI/article/download/3711/3073]&lt;/ref&gt; genome and Malayasian genome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://promiseuitm.org/component/content/article/34-slideshow/50-the-first-malay-genome.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is also a member of the Open Personal Genomics Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://openpgx.org/ |title=OpenPGx Consortium |access-date=7 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218064848/http://www.openpgx.org/ |archive-date=18 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genomics of Rare Genetic Diseases==
The institute has initiated a unique programme to use cutting edge genomic technologies to understand Rare [[genetic diseases]] in India and pioneering the application of genomics for [[Precision Medicine]] in clinics. One of the programmes which has been initiated on this front is Genomics for Understanding Rare Disease, India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com Genomics for Understanding Rare Diseases India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN)]&lt;/ref&gt; GUaRDIAN is a large-scale collaborative network of clinicians from around India trying to use genomics in clinical practice, with the focussed aim to understand genetic structure of rare genetic diseases in India.

The consortium aims at using cutting edge genomics technology to enable identification of genetic variations in diseases  and enable clinicians arrive at precise diagnosis for rare genetic disease. Apart from working closely with clinicians, the consortium aims to foster education, awareness and the widespread adoption of genomic technology in clinical settings, in addition to creating and disseminating the highest standards of genomic data generation and interpretation in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com/exome-sequence-analysis-and-interpretation Exome Sequencing Analysis and Interpretation page on GUaRDIAN]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the few years, it has been able to work closely with clinicians in the network to be able to offer proof of principles for the application of Genomics for Precision Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Gupta  |title=Whole-exome sequencing solves diagnostic dilemma in a rare case of sporadic acrokeratosis verruciformis. | journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology. | volume=| issue= | year=2015| pages= | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.12983/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Gupta  |title=Whole exome sequencing helps in accurate molecular diagnosis in siblings with a rare co-occurrence of paternally inherited 22q12 duplication and autosomal recessive non-syndromic ichthyosis. | journal=F1000 Research. | volume=| issue= | year=2015| pages= | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://f1000research.com/articles/4-446/v1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Vellarikkal  |title=Exome sequencing reveals a novel mutation, p.L325H, in the KRT5 gene associated with autosomal dominant Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex Koebner type in a large family from western India. | journal=Human Genome Variation. | volume=1| issue=1 | year=2014| pages=14007  | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.nature.com/articles/hgv20147]&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive programme for patient referral is also functional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com/referral Patient Referral Page Genomics for Understanding Rare Diseases India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension Centers (Branches)==
The main IGIB campus is located at Mall Road, New Delhi near Delhi University North Campus. IGIB's alliance with the Biotech/Pharmaceuticals has led to its growth and setting up of two extension centers - one at South Delhi (IGIB Annex at TCGA, Okhla) and the other at Western Delhi at Naraina.

==International Meetings==
IGIB was a co-host of the 13th meeting of the [[Human Genome Organization]] (HUGO) in 2008, held at [[Hyderabad International Convention Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hgm2008.hugo-international.org HGM-2008 website].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrated Movement Therapy''' (IMT) has several elements in common with [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]], including a focus on changing thoughts to change behaviours, and an emphasis on social learning theory. It also shares elements with Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, which includes an exploration of Eastern contemplative traditions. However, IMT is most aligned with Integrated Psychotherapy, in which the inherent value of each person, as well as their multiple dimensions (including physical body, energy, emotions and spiritual connection), is the foundation of the therapy. IMT uses yoga’s philosophical, physical and spiritual framework in conjunction with conventional neurophysiological perspectives to address issues including [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and anxiety to degenerative conditions and life-threatening illness.

== History ==
Integrated Movement Therapy was developed in the late 1990s by Molly Lannon Kenny, MS-CCC, a [[speech and language pathologist]] and yoga educator, for children with developmental challenges.

Lannon Kenny made several crucial observations about her clients in the clinical setting that led to the development of IMT, including the relationship between self-esteem and learning and the relationship between movement and learning readiness and retention. She noted a significant increase in communication skills when her clients were moving, as evidenced in co-treatment with [[Occupational therapy|occupational]] and [[Physical therapy|physical therapists]]. 

Lannon Kenny published her first scholarly article in the ''International Journal of Yoga Therapy'' in 2002,&lt;&lt;ref name="peacefulpathwaysyoga1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacefulpathwaysyoga.com/pdfs/Yoga-Research-Integrated-Movement-Therapy.pdf |format=PDF |title=Integrated Movement Therapy™: Yoga-Based Therapy as a Viable and Effective Intervention for Autism Spectrum and Related Disorders |author=Molly Kenny, M.S. |website=Peacefulpathwaysyoga.com |accessdate=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she described IMT as an effective intervention for [[Autism spectrum]] and related disorders, relating each of the core principles of IMT to a particular aspect of Autism.

'''Ionizing radiation''' ('''ionising radiation''') is [[radiation]] that carries enough [[energy]] to knock [[electron]]s from [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s, thereby [[ionization|ionizing]] them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic [[subatomic particle]]s, [[ion]]s or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and [[electromagnetic wave]]s on the high-energy end of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

[[Gamma ray]]s, [[X-rays]], and the higher [[vacuum ultraviolet|ultraviolet]] part of the electromagnetic spectrum are ionizing, whereas the lower [[ultraviolet]] part of the electromagnetic spectrum and all the spectrum below UV, including visible [[light]] (including nearly all types of [[laser]] light), [[infrared]], [[microwave]]s, and [[radio wave]]s are considered ''[[non-ionizing radiation]]''. The boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation that occurs in the ultraviolet is not sharply defined, since different molecules and atoms ionize at [[Ionization energies of the elements (data page)|different energies]]. Conventional definition places the boundary at a [[photon energy]] between 10&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] and 33&amp;nbsp;eV in the ultraviolet (see [[Ionizing radiation#Definition boundary for lower-energy photons|definition boundary]] section below).

Typical ionizing subatomic particles from radioactivity include [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s and [[neutron]]s. Almost all products of radioactive decay are ionizing because the energy of radioactive decay is typically far higher than that required to ionize. Other subatomic ionizing particles which occur naturally are [[muon]]s, [[meson]]s, [[positron]]s, and other particles that constitute the secondary [[cosmic ray]]s that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Woodside"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmic rays are generated by stars and certain celestial events such as [[supernova]] explosions. Cosmic rays may also produce radioisotopes on Earth (for example, [[carbon-14]]), which in turn decay and produce ionizing radiation. [[Cosmic ray]]s and the decay of [[radioactive]] isotopes are the primary sources of natural ionizing radiation on Earth referred to as [[background radiation]]. Ionizing radiation can also be generated artificially by [[X-ray tube]]s, [[particle accelerators]], and any of the various methods that produce [[radioisotopes]] artificially.

Ionizing radiation is not detectable by human senses, so radiation detection instruments such as [[Geiger counter]]s must be used to indicate its presence and measure it. However, high intensities can cause emission of visible light upon interaction with matter, such as in [[Cherenkov radiation]] and [[radioluminescence]]. Ionizing radiation is used in a wide variety of fields such as [[medicine]], [[nuclear power]], research, manufacturing, construction, and many other areas, but presents a health hazard if proper measures against undesired exposure aren't followed. Exposure to ionizing radiation causes damage to living [[tissue (anatomy)|tissue]], and can result in [[radiation burn]]s, [[cell damage]], [[radiation sickness]], [[Radiation-induced cancer|cancer]], and [[death]].

==Types==
{{main article|Particle radiation}}
[[Image:Alfa beta gamma neutron radiation.svg|thumb|Alpha ('''α''') radiation consists of a fast-moving [[helium-4]] ([[Helium-4|{{SimpleNuclide|Helium|4}}]]) nucleus and is [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|stopped]] by a sheet of paper. Beta ('''β''') radiation, consisting of [[electron]]s, is halted by an aluminium plate. Gamma ('''γ''') radiation, consisting of energetic [[photon]]s, is eventually absorbed as it penetrates a dense material. Neutron ('''n''') radiation consists of free neutrons that are blocked by light elements, like hydrogen, which slow and/or capture them. Not shown: [[galactic cosmic rays]] that consist of energetic charged nuclei such as [[proton]]s, [[helium]] nuclei, and high-charged nuclei called [[HZE ions]].]]
[[File:Cloud chambers played an important role of particle detectors.jpg|thumb|[[Cloud chamber]]s are one of few ways of visualizing ionizing radiation. They were employed mainly in [[research]] in the early days of [[particle physics]], but remain an important education tool today.]]
Ionizing radiation is categorized by the nature of the particles or electromagnetic waves that create the ionizing effect. These have different ionization mechanisms, and may be grouped as directly or indirectly ionizing.

===Directly ionizing===
Any charged massive particle can ionize atoms directly by [[fundamental interaction]] through the [[Coulomb force]] if it carries sufficient kinetic energy. This includes [[atomic nuclei]], [[electron]]s, [[muon]]s, charged [[pion]]s, [[proton]]s, and energetic charged nuclei stripped of their electrons. When moving at relativistic speeds these particles have enough kinetic energy to be ionizing, but relativistic speeds are not required. For example, a typical alpha particle is ionizing, but moves at about 5% c, and an electron with 33 eV (enough to ionize) moves at about 1% c.

The first two ionizing sources to be recognized were given special names used today: Helium nuclei ejected from atomic nuclei are called [[alpha particle]]s, and electrons ejected usually (but not always) at relativistic speeds, are called [[beta particle]]s.

Natural [[cosmic ray]]s are made up primarily of relativistic protons but also include heavier atomic nuclei like [[helium]] ions and [[HZE ions]]. In the atmosphere such particles are often stopped by air molecules, and this produces short-lived charged pions, which soon decay to muons, a primary type of cosmic ray radiation that reaches the ground (and also penetrates it to some extent). Pions can also be produced in large amounts in particle accelerators.

====Alpha particles====
{{Main article|Alpha particle}}
Alpha particles consist of two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s bound together into a particle identical to a [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. Alpha particle emissions are generally produced in the process of [[alpha decay]], but may also be produced in other ways. Alpha particles are named after the first letter in the [[Greek alphabet]], [[Alpha|α]]. The symbol for the alpha particle is α or α&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Because they are identical to helium nuclei, they are also sometimes written as {{chem|He|2+}} or {{chem|4|2|He|2+}} indicating a Helium ion with a +2 charge (missing its two electrons). If the ion gains electrons from its environment, the alpha particle can be written as a normal (electrically neutral) helium atom {{chem|4|2|He}}.

Alpha particles are a hugely ionizing form of particle radiation. When they result from radioactive alpha decay they have low penetration depth. In this case they can be [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|absorbed]] by a few centimeters of air, or by the skin. More powerful, long range alpha particles from [[ternary fission]] are three times as energetic, and penetrate proportionately farther in air. The helium nuclei that form 10-12% of cosmic rays, are also usually of much higher energy than those produced by nuclear decay processes, and when encountered in space, are thus able to traverse the human body and dense shielding. However, this type of radiation is significantly attenuated by the Earth's atmosphere, which is a radiation shield equivalent to about 10 meters of water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/Shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf One kg of water per cm squared is 10 meters of water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101094421/http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf |date=2016-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beta particles====
{{Main article|Beta particles}}
Beta particles are high-energy, high-speed [[electron]]s or [[positron]]s emitted by certain types of [[radioactive]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[potassium-40]]. The production of beta particles is termed [[beta decay]]. They are designated by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] beta (β).
There are two forms of beta decay, β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which respectively give rise to the electron and the positron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beta Decay|url=http://www.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/chapters/03/2.html|work=Lbl.gov|date=9 August 2000|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195332/http://www2.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/chapters/03/2.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When something is said to have [[radioactive contamination]], it often means that there are beta particles being emitted from its surface, detectable with a [[Geiger counter]] or other radiation detector. When brought into proximity to the beta emitter, the detector will indicate a dramatic increase in radioactivity. When the detector probe is covered with a shield to block the beta rays, the indication will be reduced dramatically.

High-energy beta particles may produce X-rays known as [[bremsstrahlung]] ("braking radiation") or [[secondary electron]]s ([[delta ray]]) as they pass through matter. Both of these can cause an indirect ionization effect.

Bremsstrahlung is of concern when shielding beta emitters, as the interaction of beta particles with the shielding material produces Bremsstrahlung. This effect is greater with material of high atomic numbers, so material with low atomic numbers is used for beta source shielding.

====Positrons and other types of antimatter====
{{Main article|Positron|Antimatter}}
The '''positron''' or '''antielectron''' is the [[antiparticle]] or the [[antimatter]] counterpart of the [[electron]]. When a low-energy positron collides with a low-energy electron, [[annihilation]] occurs, resulting in their conversion into the energy of two or more [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s (see [[electron–positron annihilation]]).

Positrons may be generated by [[positron emission]] nuclear decay (through [[weak interaction]]s), or by [[pair production]] from a sufficiently energetic [[photon]]. Positrons are common artificial sources of ionizing radiation used in medical [[PET scan|positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans.

As positrons are positively charged particles they can also directly ionize an atom through Coulomb interactions.

====Charged nuclei====
Charged nuclei are characteristic of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events and except for alpha particles (charged helium nuclei) have no natural sources on the earth. In space, however, very high energy protons, helium nuclei, and HZE ions can be initially stopped by relatively thin layers of shielding, clothes, or skin. However, the resulting interaction will generate secondary radiation and cause cascading biological effects. If just one atom of tissue is displaced by an energetic proton, for example, the collision will cause further interactions in the body. This is called "[[linear energy transfer]]" (LET), which utilizes [[elastic scattering]].

LET can be visualized as a billiard ball hitting another in the manner of the [[conservation of momentum]], sending both away with the energy of the first ball divided between the two unequally. When a charged nucleus strikes a relatively slow-moving nucleus of an object in space, LET occurs and neutrons, alpha particles, low-energy protons, and other nuclei will be released by the collisions and contribute to the total absorbed dose of tissue.&lt;ref name="NASA/TP-1999-209320"&gt;[[hdl:2060/19990051001|Contribution of High Charge and Energy (HZE) Ions During Solar-Particle Event of September 29, 1989]] Kim, Myung-Hee Y.; Wilson, John W.; Cucinotta, Francis A.; Simonsen, Lisa C.; Atwell, William; Badavi, Francis F.; Miller, Jack, NASA Johnson Space Center; Langley Research Center, May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirectly ionizing ===
Indirect ionizing radiation is electrically neutral and therefore does not interact strongly with matter. The bulk of the ionization effects are due to secondary ionizations.

An example of indirectly ionizing radiation is [[neutron radiation]].

====Photon radiation====
{{see also|Gamma rays|X-rays}}
[[Image:EM-spectrum.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Different types of [[electromagnetic radiation]]]]
[[File:Pb-gamma-xs.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|The total absorption coefficient of lead (atomic number 82) for gamma rays, plotted versus gamma energy, and the contributions by the three effects. Here, the photoelectric effect dominates at low energy. Above 5 MeV, pair production starts to dominate.]]

Even though photons are electrically neutral, they can ionize atoms directly through the [[photoelectric effect]] and the [[Compton effect]]. Either of those interactions will cause the ejection of an electron from an atom at relativistic speeds, turning that electron into a beta particle (secondary beta particle) that will ionize many other atoms. Since most of the affected atoms are ionized directly by the [[secondary beta]] particles, photons are called indirectly ionizing radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Centre of Technological Safety|title=Interaction of Radiation with Matter|url=http://www.tesec-int.org/TechHaz-site%2008/Radiation-interaction.pdf|work=Radiation Hazard|accessdate=5 November 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512170010/http://www.tesec-int.org/TechHaz-site%2008/Radiation-interaction.pdf|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photon radiation is called [[gamma ray]]s if produced by a [[nuclear reaction]], [[subatomic particle]] decay, or [[radioactive decay]] within the nucleus. It is otherwise called [[x-ray]]s if produced outside the nucleus. The generic term photon is therefore used to describe both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

X-rays normally have a lower energy than gamma rays, and an older convention was to define the boundary as a wavelength of 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; m or a photon energy of 100 keV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; That threshold was driven by limitations of older X-ray tubes and low awareness of [[isomeric transition]]s. Modern technologies and discoveries have resulted in an overlap between X-ray and gamma energies. In many fields they are functionally identical, differing for terrestrial studies only in origin of the radiation. In astronomy, however, where radiation origin often cannot be reliably determined, the old energy division has been preserved, with X-rays defined as being between about 120 eV and 120 keV, and gamma rays as being of any energy above 100 to 120 keV, regardless of source. Most astronomical "[[gamma-rays|gamma-ray astronomy]]" are known ''not'' to originate in nuclear radioactive processes but, rather, result from processes like those that produce astronomical X-rays, except driven by much more energetic electrons.

Photoelectric absorption is the dominant mechanism in organic materials for photon energies below 100 keV, typical of classical X-ray tube originated [[X-ray]]s. At energies beyond 100 keV, photons ionize matter increasingly through the [[Compton effect]], and then indirectly through [[pair production]] at energies beyond 5 MeV. The accompanying interaction diagram shows two Compton scatterings happening sequentially. In every scattering event, the gamma ray transfers energy to an electron, and it continues on its path in a different direction and with reduced energy.

====Definition boundary for lower-energy photons====
{{see also|Ultraviolet}}
The lowest ionization energy of any element is 3.89 eV, for [[caesium]]. However, US Federal Communications Commission material defines ionizing radiation as that with a [[photon energy]] greater than 10 eV (equivalent to a far [[ultraviolet]] wavelength of 124 [[nanometer]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/Documents/bulletins/oet56/oet56e4.pdf |accessdate=2011-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020131849/http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/Documents/bulletins/oet56/oet56e4.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-20 |author1=Robert F.

Thus, X-ray radiation is always ionizing, but only extreme-ultraviolet radiation can be considered ionizing under all definitions.

As noted, the biological effect of ionizing radiation on cells somewhat resembles that of a broader spectrum of '''molecularly damaging''' radiation, which overlaps ionizing radiation and extends beyond, to somewhat lower energies into all regions of UV and sometimes visible light in some systems (such as photosynthetic systems in leaves). Although [[DNA]] is always susceptible to damage by ionizing radiation, the DNA molecule may also be damaged by radiation with enough energy to excite certain [[molecular bond]]s to form [[thymine dimer]]s. This energy may be less than ionizing, but near to it. A good example is ultraviolet spectrum energy which begins at about 3.1 eV (400&amp;nbsp;nm) at close to the same energy level which can cause [[sunburn]] to unprotected skin, as a result of [[photochemistry|photoreactions]] in [[collagen]] and (in the [[UV-B]] range) also damage in DNA (for example, [[pyrimidine dimers]]). Thus, the mid and lower ultraviolet electromagnetic spectrum is damaging to biological tissues as a result of electronic excitation in molecules which falls short of ionization, but produces similar non-thermal effects. To some extent, visible light and also ultraviolet A (UVA) which is closest to visible energies, have been proven to result in formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] in skin, which cause indirect damage since these are electronically excited molecules which can inflict reactive damage, although they do not cause sunburn (erythema).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Liebel F, Kaur S, Ruvolo E, Kollias N, Southall MD |title=Irradiation of skin with visible light induces reactive oxygen species and matrix-degrading enzymes |journal=J.

[[File:Strahlenarten en.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|Radiation interaction: gamma rays are represented by wavy lines, charged particles and neutrons by straight lines. The small circles show where ionization occurs.]]

====Neutrons====
{{main article|Neutron|neutron radiation}}
[[Neutron]]s have zero electrical charge and thus often do not ''directly'' cause ionization in a single step or interaction with matter. However, fast neutrons will interact with the protons in hydrogen via [[linear energy transfer|LET]], and this mechanism scatters the nuclei of the materials in the target area, causing direct ionization of the hydrogen atoms. When neutrons strike the hydrogen nuclei, proton radiation (fast protons) results. These protons are themselves ionizing because they are of high energy, are charged, and interact with the electrons in matter.

Neutrons that strike other nuclei besides hydrogen will transfer less energy to the other particle if LET does occur. But, for many nuclei struck by neutrons, [[inelastic scattering]] occurs. Whether elastic or inelastic scatter occurs is dependent on the speed of the neutron, whether [[Neutron temperature|fast]] or [[Neutron temperature|thermal]] or somewhere in between. It is also dependent on the nuclei it strikes and its [[neutron cross section]].

In inelastic scattering, neutrons are readily absorbed in a process called [[neutron capture]] and attributes to the [[neutron activation]] of the nucleus. Neutron interactions with most types of matter in this manner usually produce [[radioactive]] nuclei. The abundant [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen-16]] nucleus, for example, undergoes neutron activation, rapidly decays by a proton emission forming [[isotopes of nitrogen|nitrogen-16]], which decays to oxygen-16. The short-lived nitrogen-16 decay emits a powerful beta ray. This process can be written as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;O (n,p) &lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N (fast neutron capture possible with &gt;11 MeV neutron)
&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N → &lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;O + β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (Decay t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.13 s)
This high-energy β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; further interacts rapidly with other nuclei, emitting high-energy γ via [[Bremsstrahlung]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While not a favorable reaction, the &lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;O (n,p) &lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N reaction is a major source of X-rays emitted from the cooling water of a [[pressurized water reactor]] and contributes enormously to the radiation generated by a water-cooled [[nuclear reactor]] while operating.

For the best shielding of neutrons, hydrocarbons that have an abundance of [[hydrogen]] are used.

In [[fissile]] materials, secondary neutrons may produce [[nuclear chain reaction]]s, causing a larger amount of ionization from the [[daughter product]]s of fission.

Outside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a mean lifetime of 14 minutes, 42 seconds. Free neutrons decay by emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino to become a proton, a process known as [[beta decay]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W.-M. Yao |display-authors=etal |url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/tables/bxxx.pdf |title=Particle Data Group Summary Data Table on Baryons |journal=J. Phys. G |volume=33 |issue=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910125729/http://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/tables/bxxx.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-10 |year=2007 |access-date=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the adjacent diagram, a neutron collides with a proton of the target material, and then becomes a fast recoil proton that ionizes in turn. At the end of its path, the neutron is captured by a nucleus in an (n,γ)-reaction that leads to the emission of a [[neutron capture]] photon. Such photons always have enough energy to qualify as ionizing radiation.

==Physical effects==
{{main article|Radiation damage}}
[[File:Cyclotron with glowing beam.jpg|thumb|right|Ionized air glows blue around a beam of particulate ionizing radiation from a [[cyclotron]]]]

===Nuclear effects===
Neutron radiation, alpha radiation, and extremely energetic gamma (&gt; ~20 MeV) can cause [[nuclear transmutation]] and [[induced radioactivity]]. The relevant mechanisms are [[neutron activation]], [[alpha absorption]], and [[photodisintegration]]. A large enough number of transmutations can change macroscopic properties and cause targets to become radioactive themselves, even after the original source is removed.

===Chemical effects===
{{main article|Radiation chemistry}}
Ionization of molecules can lead to [[radiolysis]] (breaking chemical bonds), and formation of highly reactive [[free radicals]]. These free radicals may then react chemically with neighbouring materials even after the original radiation has stopped. (e.g., [[ozone cracking]] of polymers by ozone formed by ionization of air). Ionizing radiation can disrupt crystal lattices in metals, causing them to become amorphous, with consequent swelling, [[material creep]], and embrittlement. Ionizing radiation can also accelerate existing chemical reactions such as polymerization and corrosion, by contributing to the activation energy required for the reaction. Optical materials darken under the effect of ionizing radiation.

High-intensity ionizing radiation in air can produce a visible [[ionized air glow]] of telltale bluish-purplish color. The glow can be observed, e.g., during [[criticality accident]]s, around [[mushroom cloud]]s shortly after a [[nuclear explosion]], or inside of a damaged nuclear reactor like during the [[Chernobyl disaster]].

Monatomic fluids, e.g. molten [[sodium]], have no chemical bonds to break and no crystal lattice to disturb, so they are immune to the chemical effects of ionizing radiation. Simple diatomic compounds with very negative [[enthalpy of formation]], such as [[hydrogen fluoride]] will reform rapidly and spontaneously after ionization.

===Electrical effects===
Ionization of materials temporarily increases their conductivity, potentially permitting damaging current levels. This is a particular hazard in [[semiconductor]] microelectronics employed in electronic equipment, with subsequent currents introducing operation errors or even permanently damaging the devices. Devices intended for high radiation environments such as the nuclear industry and extra atmospheric (space) applications may be made [[radiation hardening|''radiation hard'']] to resist such effects through design, material selection, and fabrication methods.

Proton radiation found in space can also cause [[single-event upset]]s in digital circuits.

The electrical effects of ionizing radiation are exploited in gas-filled radiation detectors, e.g. the [[Geiger-Muller counter]] or the [[ion chamber]].

==Health effects==
{{main article|Radiobiology}}
In general, ionizing radiation is harmful and potentially lethal to living beings but some types have medical applications in [[radiation therapy]] for the treatment of cancer and [[thyrotoxicosis]].

Most adverse health effects of exposure to ionizing radiation may be grouped in two general categories:
*deterministic effects (harmful tissue reactions) due in large part to killing or malfunction of cells following high doses from [[radiation burn]]s
*stochastic effects, i.e., [[Radiation-induced cancer|cancer]] and heritable effects involving either cancer development in exposed individuals owing to [[mutation]] of somatic cells or heritable disease in their offspring owing to mutation of reproductive (germ) cells.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 | loc= paragraph 55}}

The most common impact is stochastic [[radiation-induced cancer|induction of cancer]] with a latent period of years or decades after exposure. For example, ionizing radiation is the sole cause of [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Understanding pathophysiology |publisher=Elsevier |last=Huether |first=Sue E. |last2=McCance |first2=Kathryn L. |isbn=9780323354097 |edition=6th |location=St. Louis, Missouri |pages=530 |oclc=740632205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism by which this occurs is well understood, but quantitative models predicting the level of risk remain controversial. The most widely accepted model posits that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation increases linearly with [[effective radiation dose]] at a rate of 5.5% per [[sievert]].{{sfn | ICRP | 2007}} If this [[Linear no-threshold model|linear model]] is correct, then natural background radiation is the most hazardous source of radiation to general public health, followed by medical imaging as a close second. Other stochastic effects of ionizing radiation are [[teratogenesis]], [[Radiation-induced cognitive decline|cognitive decline]], and [[heart disease]].

==Uses==
{{main article|Nuclear technology|Radiobiology}}
Ionizing radiation has many industrial, military, and medical uses. Its usefulness must be balanced with its hazards, a compromise that has shifted over time. For example, at one time, assistants in shoe shops [[Shoe-fitting fluoroscope|used X-rays to check a child's shoe size]], but this practice was halted when the risks of ionizing radiation were better understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Shoe-fitting Fluoroscope as a Radiation Hazard |journal=California Medicine |first=Leon |last=Lewis |first2=Paul E |last2=Caplan |volume=72 |issue=1 |pmid=15408494 |date=January 1, 1950 |pmc=1520288 |pages=26–30 [27]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutron radiation is essential to the working of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. The penetrating power of x-ray, gamma, beta, and positron radiation is used for [[medical imaging]], [[nondestructive testing]], and a variety of industrial gauges. [[Radioactive tracers]] are used in medical and industrial applications, as well as biological and [[radiation chemistry]]. Alpha radiation is used in [[static eliminator]]s and [[smoke detectors]]. The sterilizing effects of ionizing radiation are useful for cleaning medical instruments, [[food irradiation]], and the [[sterile insect technique]]. Measurements of [[carbon-14]], can be used to [[radiocarbon dating|date]] the remains of long-dead organisms (such as wood that is thousands of years old).

==Sources of radiation==
Ionizing radiation is generated through nuclear reactions, nuclear decay, by very high temperature, or via acceleration of charged particles in electromagnetic fields. Natural sources include the sun, lightning and supernova explosions. Artificial sources include nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, and [[x-ray tube]]s.

The [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) itemized types of human exposures.

The [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] manages the International System of Radiological Protection, which sets recommended limits for dose uptake.

===Background radiation===
{{main article|Background radiation}}
Background radiation comes from both natural and man-made sources.

The global average exposure of humans to ionizing radiation is about 3&amp;nbsp;mSv (0.3&amp;nbsp;rem) per year, 80% of which comes from nature. The remaining 20% results from exposure to man-made radiation sources, primarily from [[medical imaging]]. Average man-made exposure is much higher in developed countries, mostly due to [[CT scans]] and [[nuclear medicine]].

Natural [[background radiation]] comes from five primary sources: cosmic radiation, solar radiation, external terrestrial sources, radiation in the human body, and [[radon]].

The background rate for natural radiation varies considerably with location, being as low as 1.5&amp;nbsp;mSv/a (1.5&amp;nbsp;mSv per year) in some areas and over 100&amp;nbsp;mSv/a in others. The highest level of purely natural radiation recorded on the Earth's surface is 90&amp;nbsp;µGy/h (0.8&amp;nbsp;Gy/a) on a Brazilian black beach composed of [[monazite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]]|title=Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation|year=2000|publisher=United Nations|url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/publications/2000_1.html|accessdate=11 November 2012|page=121|volume=vol. 1|chapter=Annex B|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804174956/http://www.unscear.org/unscear/publications/2000_1.html|archivedate=4 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest background radiation in an inhabited area is found in [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], primarily due to naturally radioactive limestone used as a building material. Some 2000 of the most exposed residents receive an average [[radiation dose]] of 10&amp;nbsp;[[mGy]] per year, (1&amp;nbsp;[[rad (unit)|rad]]/yr) ten times more than the ICRP recommended limit for exposure to the public from artificial sources.&lt;ref name="Mortazavi2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mortazavi|first=S.M.J.|author2=P.A. Karamb|title=Apparent lack of radiation susceptibility among residents of the high background radiation area in Ramsar, Iran: can we relax our standards?|journal=Radioactivity in the Environment|year=2005|volume=7|pages=1141–1147|doi=10.1016/S1569-4860(04)07140-2|issn=1569-4860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Record levels were found in a house where the [[effective radiation dose]] due to external radiation was 135&amp;nbsp;mSv/a, (13.5&amp;nbsp;rem/yr) and the [[committed dose]] from [[radon]] was 640&amp;nbsp;mSv/a (64.0&amp;nbsp;rem/yr).&lt;ref name="Sohrabi2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sohrabi|first=Mehdi|author2=Babapouran, Mozhgan|title=New public dose assessment from internal and external exposures in low- and elevated-level natural radiation areas of Ramsar, Iran|journal=Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on High Levels of Natural Radiation and Radon Areas|year=2005|volume=1276|pages=169–174 |doi=10.1016/j.ics.2004.11.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique case is over 200 times higher than the world average background radiation. Despite the high levels of background radiation that the residents of Ramsar receive there is no compelling evidence that they experience a greater health risks. The ICRP recommendations are conservative limits and may represent an over representation of the actual health risk. Generally radiation safety organization recommend the most conservative limits assuming it is best to err on the side of caution. This level of caution is appropriate but should not be used to create fear about background radiation danger. Radiation danger from background radiation may be a serious threat but is more likely a small overall risk compared to all other factors in the environment.

====Cosmic radiation====
{{see also|Cosmic ray}}
The Earth, and all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outside our solar system. This cosmic radiation consists of relativistic particles: positively charged nuclei (ions) from 1 [[Atomic mass unit|amu]] [[proton]]s (about 85% of it) to 26 amu [[iron]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and even beyond. (The high-atomic number particles are called [[HZE ions]].) The energy of this radiation can far exceed that which humans can create, even in the largest [[particle accelerator]]s (see [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]). This radiation interacts in the atmosphere to create secondary radiation that rains down, including [[x-rays]], [[muon]]s, [[proton]]s, [[antiproton]]s, [[alpha particle]]s, [[pion]]s, [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s, and [[neutron]]s.

The [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, with a dose rate that varies in different parts of the world and based largely on the geomagnetic field, altitude, and solar cycle. The cosmic-radiation dose rate on airplanes is so high that, according to the United Nations UNSCEAR 2000 Report (see links at bottom), airline flight crew workers receive more dose on average than any other worker, including those in nuclear power plants. Airline crews receive more cosmic rays if they routinely work flight routes that take them close to the North or South pole at high altitudes, where this type of radiation is maximal.

Cosmic rays also include high-energy gamma rays, which are far beyond the energies produced by solar or human sources.

====External terrestrial sources====
Most materials on Earth contain some radioactive atoms, even if in small quantities. Most of the dose received from these sources is from gamma-ray emitters in building materials, or rocks and soil when outside. The major [[radionuclide]]s of concern for '''terrestrial radiation''' are isotopes of [[potassium]], [[uranium]], and [[thorium]]. Each of these sources has been decreasing in activity since the formation of the Earth.

====Internal radiation sources====
{{see also|Committed dose}}
All earthly materials that are the building-blocks of life contain a radioactive component. As humans, plants, and animals consume food, air, and water, an inventory of radioisotopes builds up within the organism (see [[banana equivalent dose]]). Some radionuclides, like [[potassium-40]], emit a high-energy gamma ray that can be measured by sensitive electronic radiation measurement systems. These internal radiation sources contribute to an individual's total radiation dose from [[natural background radiation]].

====Radon====
An important source of natural radiation is [[radon]] gas, which seeps continuously from bedrock but can, because of its high density, accumulate in poorly ventilated houses.

[[Radon]]-222 is a gas produced by the decay of [[radium]]-226. Both are a part of the natural [[uranium]] decay chain. Uranium is found in soil throughout the world in varying concentrations. Among non-smokers, radon is the largest cause of lung cancer and, overall, the second-leading cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/radon/healthrisks.html |title=Health Risks |website=Radon |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2012-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020231845/http://www.epa.gov/radon/healthrisks.html |archivedate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiation exposure==
[[File:Exposure chart-XKCD.svg|thumb|Various doses of radiation in sieverts, ranging from trivial to lethal.]]
{{main article|Radiation protection}}
There are three standard ways to limit exposure:
# '''Time''': For people exposed to radiation in addition to natural background radiation, limiting or minimizing the exposure time will reduce the dose from the radiation source.
# '''Distance''': Radiation intensity decreases sharply with distance, according to an [[inverse-square law]] (in an absolute vacuum).&lt;ref name=Camphausen&gt;Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 "Principles of Radiation Therapy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515031929/http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 |date=2009-05-15 }} in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224102/http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ |date=2013-10-04 }}. 11 ed. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Shielding''': Air or skin can be sufficient to substantially attenuate alpha and beta radiation. Barriers of [[lead]], [[concrete]], or water are often used to give effective protection from more penetrating particles such as gamma rays and [[neutrons]]. Some radioactive materials are stored or handled underwater or by [[remote control]] in rooms constructed of thick concrete or lined with lead. There are special [[plastic]] shields that stop beta particles, and air will stop most alpha particles. The effectiveness of a material in shielding radiation is determined by its [[half-value layer|half-value thicknesses]], the thickness of material that reduces the radiation by half. This value is a function of the material itself and of the type and energy of ionizing radiation. Some generally accepted thicknesses of attenuating material are 5&amp;nbsp;mm of aluminum for most beta particles, and 3&amp;nbsp;inches of lead for gamma radiation.

These can all be applied to natural and man-made sources. For man-made sources the use of '''Containment''' is a major tool in reducing dose uptake and is effectively a combination of shielding and isolation from the open environment. Radioactive materials are confined in the smallest possible space and kept out of the environment such as in a [[hot cell]] (for radiation) or [[glove box]] (for contamination). [[Radioactive isotope]]s for medical use, for example, are dispensed in closed handling facilities, usually gloveboxes, while [[nuclear reactor]]s operate within closed systems with multiple barriers that keep the radioactive materials contained. Work rooms, hot cells and gloveboxes have slightly reduced air pressures to prevent escape of airborne material to the open environment.

In nuclear conflicts or civil nuclear releases [[civil defense]] measures can help reduce exposure of populations by reducing ingestion of isotopes and occupational exposure . One is the issue of [[potassium iodide]] (KI) tablets, which blocks the uptake of [[iodine-131|radioactive iodine]] (one of the major radioisotope products of [[nuclear fission]]) into the human [[thyroid]] gland.

===Occupational exposure===
Occupationally exposed individuals are controlled within the regulatory framework of the country they work in, and in accordance with any local nuclear licence constraints. These are usually based on the recommendations of the ICRP.
The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends limiting artificial irradiation. For occupational exposure, the limit is 50 mSv in a single year with a maximum of 100 mSv in a consecutive five-year period.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 }}

The radiation exposure of these individuals is carefully monitored with the use of [[dosimeter]]s and other radiological protection instruments which will measure radioactive particulate concentrations, area gamma dose readings and [[radioactive contamination]]. A legal record of dose is kept.

Examples of activities where occupational exposure is a concern include:
*Airline crew (the most exposed population)
*[[Industrial radiography]]
*Medical [[radiology]] and [[nuclear medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0952-4746/16/4/004|vauthors = Pattison JE, Bachmann DJ, Beddoe AH|title=Gamma Dosimetry at Surfaces of Cylindrical Containers|journal=Journal of Radiological Protection|volume= 16|issue=4|pages=249–261|year=1996|bibcode = 1996JRP....16..249P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00004032-199911000-00006|author=Pattison, J.E.|title= Finger Doses Received during Samarium-153 Injections|journal=Health Physics|volume=77|issue=5|pages=530–5|year=1999|pmid=10524506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Uranium mining
*[[Nuclear power plant]] and [[nuclear fuel reprocessing plant]] workers
*Research laboratories (government, university and private)

Some human-made radiation sources affect the body through direct radiation, known as [[effective dose (radiation)]] while others take the form of [[radioactive contamination]] and [[irradiate]] the body from within. The latter is known as [[committed dose]].

===Public exposure===
Medical procedures, such as diagnostic [[X-ray]]s, [[nuclear medicine]], and [[radiation therapy]] are by far the most significant source of human-made radiation exposure to the general public. Some of the major [[radionuclide]]s used are [[I-131]], [[Tc-99m]], [[Co-60]], [[iridium|Ir-192]], and [[caesium|Cs-137]]. The public also is exposed to radiation from consumer products, such as [[tobacco]] ([[polonium]]-210), combustible fuels (gas, [[coal]], etc.), [[television]]s, luminous [[watch]]es and dials ([[tritium]]), airport [[X-ray]] systems, [[smoke detector]]s ([[americium]]), electron tubes, and gas lantern mantles ([[thorium]]).

Of lesser magnitude, members of the public are exposed to radiation from the [[nuclear fuel]] cycle, which includes the entire sequence from processing [[uranium]] to the disposal of the spent fuel. The effects of such exposure have not been reliably measured due to the extremely low doses involved. Opponents use a cancer per dose model to assert that such activities cause several hundred cases of cancer per year, an application of the widely accepted [[Linear no-threshold model]] (LNT).

The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends limiting artificial irradiation to the public to an average of 1&amp;nbsp;mSv (0.001&amp;nbsp;Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 }}

In a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], gamma rays from both the initial weapon explosion and [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] would be the sources of radiation exposure.

====Spaceflight====
Massive particles are a concern for astronauts outside the [[earth's magnetic field]] who would receive solar particles from [[solar proton event]]s (SPE) and [[galactic cosmic rays]] from cosmic sources. These high-energy charged nuclei are blocked by Earth's magnetic field but pose a [[Health threat from cosmic rays|major health concern]] for astronauts traveling to the moon and to any distant location beyond the earth orbit. Highly charged HZE ions in particular are known to be extremely damaging, although protons make up the vast majority of galactic cosmic rays. Evidence indicates past SPE radiation levels that would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142|title=Superflares could kill unprotected astronauts|publisher=New Scientist|date=21 March 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327023245/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142|archivedate=27 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Air travel====
Air travel exposes people on aircraft to increased radiation from space as compared to sea level, including [[cosmic rays]] and from [[solar flare]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Effective Dose Rate |url=http://sol.spacenvironment.net/raps_ops/current_files/globeView.html |website=NAIRAS (Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation System) |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305061814/http://sol.spacenvironment.net/raps_ops/current_files/globeView.html |archive-date=2016-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6hymYAgC6MC&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;f=false |author1=Jeffrey R.

===Radiation hazard warning signs===
Hazardous levels of ionizing radiation are signified by the trefoil sign on a yellow background. These are usually posted at the boundary of a radiation controlled area or in any place where radiation levels are significantly above background due to human intervention.

The red ionizing radiation warning symbol (ISO 21482) was launched in 2007, and is intended for [[IAEA]] Category 1, 2 and 3 sources defined as dangerous sources capable of death or serious injury, including food irradiators, teletherapy machines for cancer treatment and industrial radiography units. The symbol is to be placed on the device housing the source, as a warning not to dismantle the device or to get any closer. It will not be visible under normal use, only if someone attempts to disassemble the device. The symbol will not be located on building access doors, transportation packages or containers.&lt;ref name=radiationsymbol&gt;{{cite web |title=New Symbol Launched to Warn Public About Radiation Dangers |date=February 15, 2007 |url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2007/radiationsymbol.html |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA} |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217075115/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/radiationsymbol.html |archive-date=2007-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Mordecai Gottman''' (born April 26, 1942) is an American psychological researcher and clinician who did extensive work over four decades on divorce prediction and marital stability. He is also an award-winning speaker, author, and a professor emeritus in [[psychology]]. He is known for his work on [[marriage|marital]] stability and relationship analysis through scientific direct observations, many of which were published in peer-reviewed literature. The lessons derived from this work represent a partial basis for the [[relationship counseling]] movement that aims to improve relationship functioning and the avoidance of those behaviors shown by Gottman and other researchers to harm human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;The Gottman Institute. [http://www.gottman.com/research/abstracts/ Online Abstracts of Published Research Articles]. Accessed online 14 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His work has also had a major impact on the development of important concepts on [[social sequence analysis]]. Gottman is a [[professor emeritus]] of psychology at the [[University of Washington]]. Dr. John Gottman and [[Julie Schwartz Gottman|Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman]] co-founded and lead a relationship company and therapist training entity called [https://www.gottman.com/ The Gottman Institute].&lt;ref&gt;John Gottman. [http://www.gottman.com/privatetherapy/search/detail/index.php?tid=106 John Gottman, Ph.D., Licensed Clinical Psychologist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226223510/http://www.gottman.com/privatetherapy/search/detail/index.php?tid=106 |date=2009-02-26 }}. Accessed online 14 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gottman was recognized in 2007 as one of the 10 most influential therapists of the past quarter century. "Gottman's research showed that it wasn't only how couples fought that mattered, but how they made up. Marriages became stable over time if couples learned to reconcile successfully after a fight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The Top 10: The Most Influential Therapists of the Past Quarter-Century | publisher = Psychotherapy Networker | year = 2007 | url=http://www.psychotherapynetworker.org/magazine/populartopics/219-the-top-10 | accessdate = 2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Predictions of divorce ==

Gottman developed multiple models, scales and formulas to predict marital stability and divorce in couples, and has completed seven studies in this field.&lt;ref name=research1&gt;{{cite web|title=Research FAQs|publisher=The Gottman Relationship Institute|accessdate=03/05/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies regarding newlywed couples are most well known.

This work concludes that the four negative behaviors that most predict divorce are criticism of partners’ personality, contempt (from a position of superiority), [[defensiveness]], and [[stonewalling]], or emotional withdrawal from interaction usually due to feeling overwhelmed by criticism.  On the other hand, stable couples handle conflicts in gentle, positive ways, and are supportive of each other.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research FAQs|url=http://www.gottman.com/49853/Research-FAQs.html|publisher=The Gottman Relationship Institute|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed the Gottman Method Couple’s Therapy based on his research findings. The therapy aims to increase respect, affection, and closeness, break through and resolve conflict, generate greater understandings, and to keep conflict discussions calm.&lt;ref name="findings"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Gottman Method Couples Therapy?|url=http://www.gottman.com/54756/About-Gottman-Method-Couples-Therapy.html|publisher=The Gottman Research Institute|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gottman Method seeks to help couples build happy and stable marriages.

Gottman’s therapy model focuses on the process of conflict within the marriage, and less on the content.  It should be noted that his research is longitudinal, meaning that he gathers data on the couples over several years.

=== Studies ===

Gottman’s predictions are based on perceived marital bond. In his 2000 study, Gottman conducted oral interviews with 95 newlywed couples. Couples were asked about their relationship, mutual history, and philosophy towards marriage. The interview measured the couple's perceptions of their history and marriage by focusing on the positive or negative qualities of the relationship expressed in the telling of the story. Rather than scoring the content of their answers, interviewers used the Oral History Interview coding system, developed by Buehlman and Gottman in 1996, to measure spouses' perceptions about the marriage and about each other. Therefore, the couples’ perception was used to predict marital stability or divorce. The more positive their perceptions and attitudes were about their marriage and each other, the more stable the marriage.&lt;ref name="method"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buehlman, K.T.|first=Gottman, John|title=The Oral History Coding System.(In J. Gottman (Ed.), What predicts divorce? The measures|year=1996|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His models partly rely on [[Paul Ekman]]'s method of analyzing human emotion and [[microexpression]]s.

==== 1992 ====

The original study was published by Gottman and Buehlman in 1992, in which they interviewed couples with children.

==== 1998 ====

In a 1998 study, Gottman developed a model to predict which newlywed couples would remain married and which would divorce four to six years later. The model fits the data with 90% accuracy. Another model fits with 81% percent accuracy for which marriages survived after seven to nine years.&lt;ref name="study98"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gottman | first = John | title = The Mathematics of Marriage | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2003 | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8757 | isbn = 978-0-262-07226-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2000 ====

Gottman’s follow-up study with newlywed couples, published in 2000, used the Oral History Interview to predict marital stability and divorce. Gottman's model fit with 87.4% accuracy for classifying couples who divorce (or not) within the couples’ first five years of marriage. He used couples’ perceptions about their marriages and each other to model marital stability or divorce.&lt;ref name="pmid10740681" /&gt;

===Critiques===
Gottman has been criticized for describing this work as accurately predicting divorce, when generally this work involves simply fitting statistical models to a data set, not making predictions about events in the future.

A paper by Richard E. Heyman, "The hazard of predicting divorce without cross validation"&lt;ref name=heyman&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heyman RE, Smith Slep AM |title=The Hazards of Predicting Divorce Without Crossvalidation |journal=J Marriage Fam |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=473–479 |date=May 2001 |pmid=17066126 |pmc=1622921 |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2001.00473.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzes 15 divorce prediction models and questions their validity.
# When analyzing a given dataset, it is possible to overfit the model to the data, which will work extremely nice for this dataset, but will not work when tested on fresh data.
# Ninety percent prediction may actually mean much less when considering false positives and the low base rates of divorce.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Overfitting can cause extreme overinflation of predictive powers, especially when oversampled extreme groups and small samples are used, as was the case with Gottman et al. (1998; n = 60 couples for the prediction analyses) and nearly all of the other divorce prediction studies ... published studies that find extraordinary initial predictive results may aid us in improving models of risk by identifying important risk factors. Nonetheless, dissemination of 'predictive power' results in the popular media must await supportive data on sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value when the predictive equation is applied to independent samples. By recognizing both the value and limitations of predictive studies, professionals and the public alike will be served best."&lt;ref name="heyman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author shows his points by creating a divorce prediction model with a data set, and showing its low validity when the above considerations are tested.

Gottman never published a reply to this critique.

Journalist Laurie Abraham also disputed the prediction power of Gottman's method. Abraham writes, "What Gottman did wasn't really a prediction of the future but a formula built after the couples' outcomes were already known. This isn't to say that developing such formulas isn't a valuable — indeed, a critical — first step in being able to make a prediction. The next step, however —one absolutely required by the scientific method— is to apply your equation to a fresh sample to see whether it actually works. That is especially necessary with small data slices (such as 57 couples), because patterns that appear important are more likely to be mere flukes. But Gottman never did that."&lt;ref name=abraham&gt;{{cite journal | last = Abraham | first = Laurie | title = Can You Really Predict the Success of a Marriage in 15 Minutes? | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2010/03/can_you_really_predict_the_success_of_a_marriage_in_15_minutes.html | magazine= Slate | date = 8 March 2010 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Gottman Relationship Institute claims that six of seven of Gottman's studies have been properly predictive, by a non-standard definition of prediction in which all that is required is that predictive variables, but not their specific relationship to the outcome, were selected in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Research FAQs | publisher = Gottman Relationship Institute | url = http://www.gottman.com/49853/Research-FAQs.html | accessdate = 4 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Gottman's 2002 paper makes no claims to [[Accuracy#Accuracy and precision in binary classification|accuracy in terms of binary classification]], and is instead a [[regression analysis]] of a two factor model where [[skin conductance]] levels and oral history narratives encodings are the only two statistically significant variables. Facial expressions using Ekman's encoding scheme were not statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gottman |first1=JM|last2= Levenson |first2=RW |title=A two-factor model for predicting when a couple will divorce: exploratory analyses using 14-year longitudinal data |journal=Fam Process |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=83–96 |year=2002 |pmid=11924092 |doi= 10.1111/j.1545-5300.2002.40102000083.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent studies testing Gottman marriage courses ==

===Building Strong Families Program===

[[File:BSF Impacts.jpg|thumb|BSF 15-Month Impact Report]]
Independent research on the impact of Gottman's [[relationship education|marriage strengthening]] programs for the general public has further questioned Gottman couple education programs.

The largest independent evaluation of a [[relationship education|marriage education]] curriculum developed by Gottman, known as "Loving Couples, Loving Children,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gottman.com/48994/MarriageCouples.html The Gottman Relationship Institute, "Gottman Programs for Couples."]&lt;/ref&gt; was conducted by Mathematica Policy Research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/family_support/ Mathematica Family Support Policy Research website]&lt;/ref&gt; at nine sites in five states through the federally funded, multi-year [[Building Strong Families Program]] study contracted by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]]. The study group included low-income, unwed couples.

An impact report released by the Office of Planning Research and Evaluation&lt;ref name=opre&gt;[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/resource/the-building-strong-families-project-implementation-of-eight-programs-to] U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the intervention had no positive impact and, in one case, "had negative effects on couples’ relationships."&lt;ref&gt;[[Building Strong Families Program#Impact report|Building Strong Families Program Impact Report, Mathematica Policy Research, May 2010.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporting Healthy Marriage Project===

An ongoing study by Manpower Development Research Corporation (MDRC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdrc.org MDRC website]&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Supporting Healthy Marriage Project]] (SHM), is evaluating Gottman's "Loving Couples, Loving Children" program among low-income, married couples. The multi-year, random assignment study is funded by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]]. In an early impact study on the effectiveness of "skills-based [[relationship education]] programs designed to help low-income married couples strengthen their relationships and, in turn, to support more stable and more nurturing home environments and more positive outcomes for parents and their children," MDRC reported &lt;ref name=impact&gt;Knox, Virginia, et al. "Early Impacts from the Supporting Healthy Marriage Evaluation," MDRC, New York, NY, March 2012.[http://www.mdrc.org/early-impacts-supporting-healthy-marriage-evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt; "Overall, the program has shown some small positive effects, without clear indications (yet no clear negative proof) for improving the odds to stay together after 12 months."

The program is still ongoing.

===Matthews, Wickrama and Conger ===

A study published by Matthews, Wickrama and Conger in 1996 based on couples’ perceptions showed that spousal hostility, net of warmth, predicted with 80% accuracy which couples would divorce or not divorce within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Lisa S. |author2=K. A. S. Wickrama |author3=Rand D. Conger |title=Predicting Marital Instability from Spouse and Observer Reports of Marital Interaction |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=August 1996|volume=58|issue=3|pages=641–655|doi=10.2307/353725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations and effects==

In multiple analyses, Gottman has shown a plethora of relations and effects in marriage and divorce, some in peer-reviewed publications, while many others appear in Gottman's own books. Among those are
* The physical elements in marital conflict (i.e., physical effects are central to the inability to think, etc., in conflict situations) for which he advises a 20-minute cooling period or physical relaxation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Marriage Clinic,'' John Gottman, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
* The effects of "bids for connection." That is the smallest bids people do to connect and how the other reacts. For example, happy couples do have many more "bids for connection" when together, and much more "turn towards" response, and much, much fewer "turn away" - the most negative reaction. The book dedicated to this element is "The Relationship Cure."
* The concept of "trust," which Gottman defines as the tendency to cooperate to form "win-win" situations, and the ability to get unstuck from the loss-loss state loop (like mutual defecting in the [[Prisoner's dilemma]]). A central feature of unhappy relationships, notes Gottman, is that couples are stuck in loss-loss loops.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Science of Trust, John Gottman, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* The neutral affect provides a way out of negative interactions as most interactions do not transition directly from negative to positive. The degree of neutral affect is often overlooked as a predictor of relationship success due to the very fact that the neutral affect is simply neutral.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* The dynamic to cause divorce in the short term is different from that causing divorce later. Early divorce is characterized by the "four horsemen" of bad fighting, whereas later divorce is characterized by lower positive affect in earlier stages of the relationship.
* Anger is not at all bad for relationships. Happy couples are as frequently angry as unhappy couples. It seems that how people react to anger and how destructive they get is the crucial factor rather than the frequency of anger or fights. Gottman even says that anger is functional in marriage.
* 69% of happy couples still have *the very same* unresolved conflicts after 10 years, yet remain happy because they do not get gridlocked in the conflict and manage to get around it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Marriage Clinic'', John Gottman, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contempt and marriage===
Gottman's theory states that there are four major emotional reactions that are destructive and thus are the four predictors to a divorce: [[criticism]], [[defensiveness]], [[stonewalling]], and [[contempt]]. Among these four, Gottman considers contempt the most important of them all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Seven Principles===
In his book ''[[The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work]]'', (his most popular book) Gottman discusses behaviors that he has observed in marriages that are successful and those that are detrimental to marriage, based on his research conducted at his lab in [[Seattle]], Washington. He has outlined seven principles that will reinforce the positive aspects of a relationship and help marriages endure during the rough moments.

==Practical solutions==

Here is a partial list of methods and practices developed by Gottman for marriage and child-rearing:

===Therapist education===
The Gottman Institute certifies new therapists regularly. Three levels of professional training are generally delivered through intensive two-day seminars or through at-home or online study to train therapists in Gottman Method Couples Therapy:&lt;ref&gt;"Research-based couples therapy training for individuals and groups," The Gottman Relationship Institute website, retrieved November 26, 2012. {{cite web |url=http://www.gottman.com/49009/Clinical-TrainingEvents.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123012842/http://www.gottman.com/49009/Clinical-TrainingEvents.html |archivedate=2012-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Learn to integrate research-based methods and inspire transformation in your work with couples.
* Identify the communication patterns, friendship basis, and conflict management dynamics that characterize enduring intimate relationships.
* Discover a roadmap for helping couples to compassionately manage their conflicts, deepen their friendship and intimacy, and share their life purpose and dreams.

===Pre-birth workshop===
''Bringing Baby Home'' is a two-day seminar to help prepare would-be parents to a new baby, using 18 exercises and other tricks. 
In a peer-reviewed paper, Gottman shows that for a randomly controlled (but not blinded) experiment, couples attending the workshop were tremendously better off later, as follows:
Without the workshop, 70% of couples had lower marital satisfaction relative to before birth (a common finding); 58% of mothers had some symptoms of depression after giving birth.
Participation in the workshop resulted in no reduction in marital satisfaction,but only 22% of mothers had depressive symptoms.

===Self-help books===
Gottman has authored and co-authored multiple books for a general audience on marriage improvement, etc., raising emotionally intelligent children, and on how to bring a new baby home without damaging the relationship.

=== The Gottman Method of Relationship Therapy ===
Gottman summarised the four critical predictive factors to the risk of the relationship by examples with "Four Horseman" which are Criticism of the personality, Defensiveness, Stonewalling and Contempt.

== Personal life ==
John Gottman was born in the Dominican Republic to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] parents. His father was a rabbi in pre-WWII Vienna. John was educated in a [[Lubavitch]] yeshiva elementary school in Brooklyn, and he observes kosher and the Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The couple currently live in Washington state.

==Awards and honors==
Gottman has been the recipient of four [[National Institute of Mental Health]] Research Scientist Awards, the [[American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy]] Distinguished Research Scientist Award,  the American Family Therapy Academy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afta.org/ American Family Therapy Academy website]&lt;/ref&gt; Award for Most Distinguished Contributor to Family Systems Research, the [[American Psychological Association]] Division of Family Psychology, Presidential Citation for Outstanding Lifetime Research Contribution and the National Council of Family Relations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncfr.org/ National Council of Family Relations website]&lt;/ref&gt; 1994 Burgess Award for Outstanding Career in Theory and Research.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.gottman.com/about/john_gottman/ "About John Gottman"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127050057/http://www.gottman.com/about/john_gottman/ |date=2010-01-27 }} on the Gottman Institute website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Konrad Pesudovs''' (b 1969) is an Australian [[Optometry|optometrist]] and [[outcomes research]]er in [[ophthalmology]].  He is the President of the [[Australian College of Optometry]] (2016-).  He was the Foundation Chair of Optometry and Vision Science at [[Flinders University]] from 2009-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1444-0938.2009.00448.x/pdf|title=Konrad Pesudovs leads new optometry course at Flinders University|year=2010|journal=Clinical and Experimental Optometry|volume=93|issue=1|pages=50–51|doi=10.1111/j.1444-0938.2009.00448.x|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Pesudovs was born in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 1969 to [[Latvians|Latvian]] immigrant parents.  He was educated at [[Turramurra, New South Wales|Turramurra Public School]], Roosevelt Elementary School, [[Victoria Independent School District|Rowland Elementary School]], Doncaster Park Primary School, [[Templestowe Lower, Victoria|Templestowe Heights Primary School]] and later [[Trinity Grammar School (Victoria)|Trinity Grammar School]].  In 1990, he obtained Bachelor of Science in Optometry at the [[University of Melbourne]], a Certificate of Competence in the Rehabilitation of the Partially Sighted at the [[Australian College of Optometry]] in 1996, a Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Clinical Optometry at the [[University of Melbourne]] in 2000, and completed his Ph.D. at [[Flinders University]] in 2000.  In 2001 he obtained MCOptom from the [[College of Optometrists]]. In 2012 was admitted as a Graduate of the [[Australian Institute of Company Directors]], becoming a Fellow of the [[Australian Institute of Company Directors]] in 2015. He is also a Fellow of the [[Australian College of Optometry]] (1992), the [[American Academy of Optometry]] (1995) the Cornea and Contact Lens Society of Australia (1999) and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (2016).

==Professional career==
Pesudovs won a [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) Sir Neil Hamilton Fairley Fellowship to be a post-doc at the [[University of Bradford]] with Prof David Elliott (2001-2003).  He then moved to the [[University of Houston]] as a post-doc with Prof [[Raymond A. Applegate]] (2003-2004). In late 2004, he returned to [[Flinders University]] where he became a [[clinical research]] fellow funded by an [[NHMRC]] Career Development Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/grants/fellows/funded/outcomes/cda06.pdf |title=Career Development Awards|publisher= [[NHMRC]]|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, he was Chief Investigator A on the successful funding of the [[NHMRC]] Centre of Clinical Research Excellence in Ophthalmology Outcomes Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/grants-funding/directory-previous-nhmrc-grants/grants-funded-under-centres-clinical-research-excelle|title= Grants funded under the Centres of Clinical Research Excellence (CCRE) scheme|publisher= [[NHMRC]]|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then he has received a number of NHMRC project grants with a career total [[NHMRC]] funding of over US$5million and total career grant funding of over US$9million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://researchdata.ands.org.au/prof-konrad-pesudovs/526371|title=Prof Konrad Pesudovs National Health and Medical Research Council|publisher= Research Data Australia|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His research interest is ophthalmology [[outcomes research]]; incorporating optical, visual and patient-reported measurement into the holistic assessment of ophthalmic outcomes.  A key element of this is the development of [[patient-reported outcome]] measures including visual disability, [[quality of life]] and other latent traits using Rasch analysis.  He has developed a number of questionnaires and is the leader of an international project to develop [[item bank]]ing and [[computer adaptive testing]] for measuring [[patient-reported outcome]]s in ophthalmology (the Eye-tem Bank Project).  Another key area of [[outcomes research]] is in the measurement of the optics of the eye and visual performance.  He has conducted [[outcomes research]] in treatments for all the major blinding eye diseases, with particular emphasis on [[cataract]] and corneal disease.

This is a partial '''list of awareness ribbons'''. The meaning behind an [[awareness ribbon]] depends on its colors and pattern. Since many advocacy groups have adopted ribbons as symbols of support or awareness, ribbons, particularly those of a single color, some colors may refer to more than one cause. Some causes may be represented by more than one ribbon.

'''Misión Hábitat''' ("'''Mission Habitat'''") is a [[Venezuela]]n [[Bolivarian Missions|Bolivarian Mission]] that has as its goal the construction of thousands of new housing units for the poor. The program also seeks to develop agreeable and integrated housing zones that make available a full range of social services &amp;mdash; from education to healthcare &amp;mdash; which likens its vision to that of [[New Urbanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boothroyd|first1=Rachael|title=Venezuelan Government Launches Massive New Housing Mission|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/6167|website=venezuelaanalysis.com|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Polga-Hecimovich|first1=John|title=The Best Intentions?

According to Venezuela's ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'', Chávez promised to build 150,000 houses in 2006.

'''Misión Ribas''' (launched November 2003) is a [[Venezuela]]n [[Bolivarian Missions|Bolivarian Mission]] that provides remedial high school level classes to the five million Venezuelan high school dropouts; named after independence hero [[José Félix Ribas]].

In July 2006 President Chávez announced that the Mission Ribas should become a socio-political movement conformed by students, family members and professors to guarantee its role as a promoting agent of the [[Bolivarian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnv.gov.ve/noticias/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=2&amp;t=35476 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716031241/http://www.rnv.gov.ve/noticias/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=2&amp;t=35476 |archivedate=July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been many concerns about the effectiveness of this and other missions lately. Even Chávez has expressed worry about the high number of people who drop out of school or do not continue to the Mision Sucre, or Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alta deserción de graduados de Ribas angustia a Chávez|url=http://economia.eluniversal.com/2007/03/22/pol_art_alta-desercion-de-gr_221700.shtml|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=El Universal|date=22 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122001838/http://economia.eluniversal.com/2007/03/22/pol_art_alta-desercion-de-gr_221700.shtml|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pro-government deputy Pastora Medina admitted that "there are denunciations about the way scholarships are given. There is little commitment from the pupils and the teachers of the Misión Ribas and this has led to a wrong development. In the Caricuao area, in Caracas, there are 300 pupils registered, but only eight go to classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendez|first=Gustavo|title=AN investigará irregularidades en misiones educativas|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2007/03/22/pol_art_an--investigara-irre_220748|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=El Universal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508062101/http://www.eluniversal.com/2007/03/22/pol_art_an--investigara-irre_220748|archivedate=8 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The state-owned [[Petróleos de Venezuela|Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA)]] is a large contributor to Mission Ribas. In 2009, US$2.1 billion were allocated to the mission, which according to PDVSA were "resources that have resulted in the issuance of 159,749 scholarships" and helped 632,623 Venezuelans earn "the title of Bachelor of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela".&lt;ref name=PDVSAmr&gt;{{cite web|title=Misión Ribas|url=http://www.pdvsa.com/index.php?tpl=interface.sp/design/readmenu.tpl.html&amp;newsid_obj_id=464&amp;newsid_temas=40|publisher=Petroleos de Venezuela|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, it was reported that "most of the students also receive [[stipend]]s of $85 a month to attend" and that "the students themselves choose who gets the stipends, based on need and dedication".&lt;ref name=NYT2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Tina|title=The Perils Of Petrocracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/magazine/04oil-t.html?pagewanted=7|accessdate=5 October 2014|agency=[[New York Times]]|date=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology teaching ==
Mission Ribas officials stated that "Political and ideological training ... is the top qualification for a facilitator". Ribas officials gave students lengthy talks about supporting the Venezuelan government, especially during the [[2007 Venezuelan Elections]] when one official from Las Torres told students "to attend marches and street demonstrations supporting Chávez".&lt;ref name=NYT2007/&gt;

==Socialist Production Brigades==
In May 2009, Citizen Minister and President of PDVSA, Rafael Ramírez, created Socialist Production Brigades from former graduates which aimed to "constitute the aim of promoting community participation and inclusion of volunteerism through the implementation of [[socialist]]-oriented projects the execution of works and services to meet the needs in different sectors".&lt;ref name=PDVSAmr/&gt;

'''Monar''' is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[non-governmental organization]] focused on helping drug addicts, the homeless, those who are [[HIV positive]] or who have [[AIDS]], and many other groups of people who need help. It was established formally as an [[Professional association|association]] in 1981.

The origins of Monar lie in the centre which was opened on 15 October 1978 in [[Gloskow]] near [[Garwolin]], by [[Marek Kotański]]. He and several other volunteers rebuilt an abandoned house in ruins.

The organisation maintains 30 stationary centres of rehabilitation, and 28 points of "temporary help" for drug and alcohol addicts. It also maintains 70 hostels for homeless people and 13 points of information trying to prevent AIDS, drug addiction, helping parents etc.

The organisation employs around 700 professionals (medical staff, psychologists etc.) and it is supported by around 300 volunteers each year. Around 2,000 drug and alcohol addicts are recovered each year. Around 20,000 homeless people are using Monar hostels.

NATAL specializes in the field of war-and-terror-related trauma, [[PTSD]] and resiliency-building among civil society. NATAL was the first center in Israel to standartize and create protocols for coping with trauma and resilience-building in a social  general society context&lt;ref&gt;Friedman-Peleg, Keren (2014).

== '''Background - Israeli society coping with trauma''' ==  
Israel is often described as a lab for research of psychological stress. During decades of conflict war and lethal terror have become integral part of the life of Israeli civil society. While the 1973 Yom Kippur war served as the formative event that reformed professional approach towards trauma among soldiers, the second intifada in the early 2000s changed the aprroach towards trauma effect, treatment and resilience among the civil society&lt;ref&gt;Somer, Ilan and Bleich, Avi (2005) Mental Health in Terror's Shadow: The Israeli experience. Tel Aviv University: Ramot publisher. p. 9-11 {{ISBN|965-274-404-2}} &lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[The Yom Kippur War]], which broke out in [[1973]], introduced trauma to Israeli public discourse. It induced a systematic change in the way trauma was acknowledged and tackled in Israeli society. The war still serves as a formative event in Israeli collective memory. It bares far-reaching ramifications over Israeli politics, economy, defense and intelligence systems, as well as over the general society and public discourse&lt;ref&gt;Keynan, Irit (2012). Like a hidden wound - War trauma in Israeli society. Tel Aviv: Am Oved Publishers Ltd. p. 63. {{ISBN|978-965-13-2276-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in raising issues of the total sacrifice of the individual, responsibility of the state and collective trauma. 

The IDF reformed approach towards trauma and PTSD was one result of the war&lt;ref&gt;Keinan, Irit (2012). Like a hidden wound - War trauma in Israeli Society. Tel Aviv: Am Oved Publishers Ltd. p. 63. {{ISBN|978-965-13-2276-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The integration of mental health components in the medical system, was another&lt;ref&gt;Keinan, Irit (2012). Like a hidden Wound. Tel Aviv: Am Oved publishers Ltd. pp. 63–67. {{ISBN|978-965-13-2276-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The long-term process initiated in 1973, acknowledging trauma among Israeli soldiers and veterans also contributed to acknowledging trauma among civilians later on in the 1990's (First [[Golf War]], 1991) and more so during [[the second Intifada]] (2000-2004). 

== '''NATAL's model''' ==

In its early days NATAL consisted of a helpline and clinical unit that laid the foundation for NATAL's multi-disciplinary model. NATAL addressed then mainly Yom Kippur veterans who twenty years after the war acknowledged their PTSD. Later on the model developed and extended to wider circles civil society. 

=== Models' guidelines ===

The following serve as general working principles:

*NATAL's working model, vocational trainings and programs are based on the [[whole person approach]]. NATAL's Helpline model derives from [[Judith Lewis Herman]] approach for coping with and recovering from trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Herman, Judith (1992). Trauma and Recovery. New York: Basic Books. pp. 11, 163–261. {{ISBN|965-13-0988-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Intervention during emergency and resilience building during peace times'''. 
*'''Tailor made therapy programs'''. To this end the model offers a wide range of therapeutic methods including [[EMDR]], [[Biofeedback]], [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]], [[Mindfulness]] and [[mindfulness meditation]], clinical sessions, art therapy and more.  Various combnations form individual programs for each client. 
*'''Removal of barriers''' including bureaucratic, financial and other. 
*'''Ethical commitment''' to equality taking in all patients, integrity, accessibility and to helping those who need it most and in view of how trauma hits disadvantaged communities the hardest. 
*'''Sharing knowledge''' via trainings, workshops and partnerships in Israel and overseas.

=== Model's components ===
#'''A Clinical unit''' provides nationwide therapy to any Israeli civilian traumatized by terror and war, as well as their family members and friends. A range of different therapeutic interventions focus on reducing the suffering caused by post-traumatic stress, and the impact of symptoms on various life domains. There is emphasis on continuity of care through additional NATAL units, including the Helpline and Community Outreach. ''Principles of intervention'': the clinical unit prioritizes the creation of a safe place enabling patients to establish trust and confidence again in themselves and their abilities. 
#'''[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=93393 NATAL's Helpline]'''offers both on short term and long-term intervention. A toll-free 1-800 number the NATAL model helpline operates in five languages and is free. It serves as a portal to NATAL's other units if necessary. Operated by trained volunteers it serves as a model also of volunteers operation. 
#'''A Community outreach unit''' works with communities, local authorities or professional communities of high risk of primary or secondary exposure to trauma. The work is either to cope with traumatic events or building resilience prior to event or as a way coping with an ongoing pressure. Target communities include families and communities under fire as well as schools, hospitals, factories, local authorities, fire fighters, police.
#'''A Social-Rehabilitation Club''' offers wide range of occupational therapy and indoor as well as outdoor activities to those who suffer from both primary and secondary trauma. Most referrals are made via the clinical unit. The club also serves as a social network. 
#'''A Psycho-historical Testimonial Center''' serves as part of the therapeutic process. 
#'''A Multidisciplinary Center for Trauma-Focused Studies''' offers a one-year psychotherapy program next to a range of courses for private professionals as well as those who work in governmental, military and other state strata. 
#'''A Research and evaluation unit''' continuously evaluates all work and programs. It also conducts research to evaluate how ongoing war and conflict reality affect resiliency of various groups in Israeli society. 
#'''Raising Awareness''' through public events as well as advocacy serves as a goal in itself in order to break silence and make the transparent wound of trauma visible and legitimate. 
#'''Vocational trainings and international partnerships'''.

== '''NATAL - Founders and founding history''' ==

The late Dr. '''[[Yossi Hadar]]''' and art therapist and Israeli philanthropist NATAL's Chairperson '''[[Judith Yovel Recanati]]''' established NATAL in June 1998. The 1973 Yom Kippur war affected both co-founders and paved each of their ways to dealing with trauma and post trauma. Dr. Hadar served as a medical doctor in the Golan heights during the war, treated wounded under fire and faced a near captivity experience. Judith Recanati served as a welfare officer treating families of severely wounded soldiers. 

Their first encounter was in the 1980s at the Loewenstein rehabilitatin hospital where Recanati worked as an art therapist with head, spine injured patients, and Dr. Hadar was her mentor. Later Recanati studied psychotherapy in Bar Ilan University, where Yossi Hadar chaired the program. 

In 1997, Hadar approached Recanati offering her to join him in establishing an NGO dedicated to supporting those who coped with trauma induced by security conditions and war. It was the first NGO established with this orientation. Only 25 years after the Yom Kippur war did its ex-soldiers begin to approach therapy. During 1997, an establishment team of some ten therapists was established. 
Dr. Hadar passed away a few weeks after NATAL's inception, after diagnosed with cancer.  
Following his sudden death, a re-organization process took place and Ms. Recanati was appointed Chairperson of NATAL.

This was a formative experience with a long lasting impact over her future decisions in life. Rooted in Israeli ethos and values, the scouts activities and education programs, touring and hiking Israel embodied the local Israeli identity formed during state-building years after the holocaust and before 1967. Another dimension was the activity being independent from her well established, dominant and europe oriented family.

During and after the war,  due to a growing need for ground forces, women were needed in roles in the field[1]. According to Rina Bar-Tal, chair of the Israel Women's Network, roles for women beyond technical and secretarial support only started to open up in the late 1970s and early '80s, because of manpower shortages. In this view Recanati drafted again serving one more year as a medical affairs officer facilitating care for families and individuals affeced by the war.

She studied photography at Hamidrasha Arts Academy and art therapy Lesly College.

{{Mesopotamian myth|expanded=5}}
'''Namtar''' (or '''Namtaru''', or '''Namtara'''; meaning destiny or fate), was a [[chthonic]] minor [[deity]] in [[Mesopotamian mythology]], god of death, and minister and messenger of [[An (mythology)|An]], [[Ereshkigal]], and [[Nergal]].&lt;ref&gt;Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary By Jeremy A. Black, Anthony Green, p 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Namtar was the son of [[Enlil]] and [[Ereshkigal]]; he was born before his father raped the goddess [[Ninlil]]. Namtar was considered responsible for diseases and pests. It was said that he commanded sixty diseases in the form of demons that could penetrate different parts of the human body; offerings to him were made to prevent those illnesses. It is thought that the Assyrians and Babylonians took this belief from the Sumerians after conquering them. To some they were the spirit of [[destiny|fate]], and therefore of great importance. Apparently they executed the instructions given him concerning the fate of men, and could also have power over certain of the gods. In other writings they were regarded as the personification of death, much like the modern concept of the [[Grim Reaper]].&lt;ref&gt;Mesopotamian religion and Ereshkigal under Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Doctrine of Sin in the Babylonian Religion By Julian Morgenstern, Paul Tice p 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myths of Babylonia and Assyria By Donald A. Mackenzie p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

In the story of Ishtar's Descent to the underworld, acting as [[Ereshkigal]]'s 'messenger', Namtar curses [[Ishtar]] with 60 diseases, naming five of the head, feet, side, eyes, and heart, after she arrives in the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;An Encyclopaedia of Religions by Maurice Arthur Canney p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

Namtar was regarded as the beloved son of Bêl/Enlil, and was married to the underworld goddess [[Hušbišag]].

'''National Biomedical Imaging Archive''' (NBIA) is an [[Open-source software]] [[Web application]] managed by the [[United States]] [[National Cancer Institute|National Cancer Institute (NCI)]] intended to create searchable repositories of [[in vivo]] images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/NBIA/National+Biomedical+Imaging+Archive+-+NBIA|title = National Biomedical Imaging Archive - NBIA - Imaging - NBIA - National Cancer Institute - Confluence Wiki|website = wiki.nci.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The software is described in detail and can be downloaded from the [https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/NBIA/National+Biomedical+Imaging+Archive+-+NBIA NBIA wiki].  A [https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/NBIA/NBIA+Refactoring+Analysis+Project re-factoring analysis] which examined the current status of development and future strategies was completed in 2015 and published on the NCI wiki.  A demo instance of NBIA is deployed at http://imaging.nci.nih.gov/.  Initially this was leveraged by NCI's [http://imaging.cancer.gov/ Cancer Imaging Program] to support the data sharing needs of the cancer imaging research community, but most of that data has been migrated to [[The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/CIP/NBIA+at+CBIIT+Image+Collections|title = NBIA at CBIIT Image Collections - Imaging - Cancer Imaging Program - National Cancer Institute - Confluence Wiki|website = wiki.nci.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TCIA continues to leverage the NBIA software as part of its infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Clark|first = Kenneth|last2 = Vendt|first2 = Bruce|last3 = Smith|first3 = Kirk|last4 = Freymann|first4 = John|last5 = Kirby|first5 = Justin|last6 = Koppel|first6 = Paul|last7 = Moore|first7 = Stephen|last8 = Phillips|first8 = Stanley|last9 = Maffitt|first9 = David|date = 2013-07-25|title = The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA): Maintaining and Operating a Public Information Repository|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10278-013-9622-7|journal = Journal of Digital Imaging|language = en|volume = 26|issue = 6|pages = 1045–1057|doi = 10.1007/s10278-013-9622-7|issn = 0897-1889|pmc = 3824915|pmid = 23884657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pacific Society for Reproductive Health (PSRH) Trust''' has a membership of health professionals working in the many Island nations in the Pacific in the area of [[reproductive health]] and [[neonatology]]. Launched in 1995 in [[Port Vila]], [[Vanuatu]], the Society is registered as a Charitable Trust in New Zealand where the secretariat is housed in the Pacific Women's Health Research Unit at the University of Auckland.

The objectives of PSRH are to advocate for the improvement of maternal and child health across the Pacific by promoting and seeking educational opportunities for its members. More information can be obtained from the Secretariat at Middlemore Hospital, PB 93311, Auckland, New Zealand.

The PSRH and RANZOCG contributed in a major way to the report on "Making Maternal Health Matter"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpi.org.nz/ParliamentaryGroup/NZPPDEvents.aspx|title=NZPPD Launches Report on Maternal Health in the Pacific|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre''', also known as the '''Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute''' and commonly abbreviated as the '''Peter Mac''', is an Australian [[oncology research]] [[research institute|institute]], [[cancer treatment]], and professional [[oncologist]] training centre located  in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The Centre is named in honour of Sir [[Peter MacCallum]].&lt;ref name="60 years"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/portraits-of-hope/story-e6freuy9-1225700166324 | title=60 years of Sir Peter MacCallum's dream | work=[[Sunday Herald Sun]] | date=19 April 2009 | accessdate=2 August 2016 | author=Riley, Robyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since June 2016, the Peter Mac has been located within the [[Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre]] (VCCC) in {{VICcity|Parkville}}. 

Together with the VCCC, the Peter Mac is Australia’s only [[List of hospitals in Australia|public hospital]] dedicated to cancer treatment, research and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.petermac.org/about/our-history |title=Our history |date= |accessdate=13 September 2016 |website= |publisher=Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=September 2016}} It is also one of the few cancer treatment facilities in the world which has a fully integrated clinical and laboratory program situated alongside a hospital.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This co-location facilitates the translation of research findings into clinical outcomes within the single site.

Research programs at the centre include the [[Australian Cancer Research Foundation]] (ACRF) Cancer Cell Biology Program&lt;ref name="acrf research page"&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.acrf.com.au/cancer-research-projects/peter-maccallum-cancer-centre-2/ |title=Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre |date=2004 |accessdate=13 September 2016 |website= |publisher=[[Australian Cancer Research Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ACRF Victorian Centre for Functional Genomics in Cancer.&lt;ref name="acrf media release"&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.acrf.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/100315_acrf_victorian_centre_for_functional_genomics_in_cancer_opening_media_release.pdf |title=Unique in Australia, New cancer genomics centre opens in Melbourne |date=2010 |accessdate=13 September 2016 |website= |publisher=[[Australian Cancer Research Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peter Mac offers much in the way of integrated services, including medical oncology and [[radiation oncology]] facilities and links with allied health services such as [[physiotherapy]], [[occupational therapy]], [[dietetics]], [[speech therapy]] and social services.

==History==
The Victorian Cancer Institute's cancer hospital was given the title Peter MacCallum Clinic after the (then) dean of the [[Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne|Faculty of Medicine at Melbourne University]], Peter MacCallum, who along with Rutherford Kaye-Scott had a significant role in its founding in 1949.&lt;ref name="60 years"/&gt; At the time it was a common practice not to inform patients that they had cancer. It was thought that because radiotherapy was also quite commonly used at that time to treat non-cancerous conditions such as [[Acne vulgaris|severe acne]], "[[hemangioma|strawberry birthmarks]]", [[frozen shoulder]]s, [[Keloid|keloid scars]] and also to provide a valuable and non-invasive means for medical [[Human sterilization|sterilisation]], the name "Peter MacCallum Clinic" would be much less threatening because the clinic could be [[Positioning (marketing)|positioned]] as a specialist radiotherapeutic centre rather than it being thought of as a dedicated cancer hospital.{{cn|date=August 2016}} In 1986, the clinic was renamed as the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute.&lt;ref name="60 years"/&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Peter mac inst-1w.jpg|thumb|The former Peter Mac site in {{VICcity|East Melbourne}}.]]
Situated within Parkville Biomedical Precinct, the Peter Mac's Melbourne centre is housed within the VCCC building located at 305 Grattan Street, Melbourne, with satellite services at the [[Bendigo Base Hospital]], [[Epworth Eastern]], the [[Monash Medical Centre]] ([[Moorabbin]] campus in [[East Bentleigh]]) and Sunshine Hospital in [[St Albans, Victoria|St Albans]]. Prior to its relocation to this site in June 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.petermac.org/news/our-new-home |title=Our new home |work= |publisher=Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre |date=22 June 2016 |access-date=13 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Peter Mac was located for 22 years in {{VICcity|East Melbourne}} in the former St Andrew's Hospital, a maternity hospital which was run by the Presbyterian Church. Prior to 1994, the then Peter MacCallum Clinic was located at the corner of [[William Street, Melbourne|William Street]] and [[Little Lonsdale Street, Melbourne|Little Lonsdale Street]].&lt;ref name="60 years"/&gt;

Today the Peter Mac comprises a sprawling biomedical precinct involving some shared services with the nearby [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]], the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] and the [[Royal Children's Hospital]].

'''Phytopharmacology''' is the study and practice of eradicating plant pathology originated from the ''Verbandes Deutscher Pflanzenärzte'' (1928–1939), (German Plant Physicians Society), headed by [[Otto Appel]], known as the ''Organiser of German Plant Protection'', who initially defined the terminology of ''Phyto-Medicine'' or ''Plant Medicine''. The [[Deutsche Phytomedizinische Gesellschaft]] (German Phytomedicine Society) is the German association of phytomedicine practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpg.phytomedizin.org/de/die-dpg/|publisher=Deutschen Phytomedizinischen Gesellschaft e.V. (German Phytomedical Society eV, Scientific Society for Plant Health and Plant Protection of 1928)|title=Phytomedicine|quote=Just as one calls a doctor to a sick person or animal, one should also be able in the future to call on the advice of a plant doctor when plant sickness occurs. This doctor should be capable of diagnosing the disease and, in the case of the most important and common diseases, to prescribe a cure or means of preventing the disease spreading. He should ….. also be concerned with prevention, much as hygiene is in human medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic programs in phytomedicine, such as at the [[University of Hohenheim]], consider the interrelationships between pathogenic microorganisms and crops, disease control methods, and research programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phytomedizin.uni-hohenheim.de/en/69521|title=Program in phytomedicine|publisher=Institute of Phytomedicine, University of Hohenheim, Germany|date=5 October 2017|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the term ''phytopharmacology'' was used for the field of study on drugs that affect plants.&lt;ref&gt;David Macht, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1076786/pdf/pnas01770-0060.pdf "Phytopharmacological reactions of normal, toxic and atoxic sera"], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' (USA), vol. 22, pp. 384-389, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21967">In [[global health]], '''priority-setting''' is a term used for the process and strategy of deciding which health interventions to carry out. Priority-setting can be conducted at the disease level (i.e. deciding which disease to alleviate), the overall strategy level (i.e. [[selective primary healthcare]] versus [[primary healthcare]] versus more general [[health systems strengthening]]), research level (i.e. which health research to carry out),&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt; or other levels.&lt;ref name=durand /&gt;{{rp|5}}

==Definitions==

Priority-setting is the act of deciding which health interventions to carry out, and can occur at several levels of granularity. Priority-setting can occur at the following levels:&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=durand /&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name="pmac2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/CallForAbstract.pdf |title=Call for Abstracts: Priority Setting for Universal Health Coverage |accessdate=June 23, 2016 |publisher=Prince Mahidol Award Conference 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* health budget level (i.e. deciding how much to spend on health overall)
* overall strategy level (i.e. [[selective primary healthcare]] versus [[primary healthcare]] versus more general [[health systems strengthening]])
* disease level (i.e. deciding which disease to alleviate)
* intervention level within each disease (i.e. restricting to a specific disease and prioritizing among interventions for that disease)
* drug level
* research level (i.e. which health research to carry out)

Synonymous terms include "prioritization in health care and health research", "priority determination", "health priorities",&lt;ref name=rudan2010/&gt; and "agenda-setting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 370| issue = 9595| pages = 1370–1379| last1 = Shiffman| first1 = Jeremy| last2 = Smith| first2 = Stephanie| title = Generation of political priority for global health initiatives: a framework and case study of maternal mortality| journal = The Lancet| accessdate = 2016-07-26| date = 2007| url = http://www.who.int/pmnch/topics/advocacy/JShiffman-globalsmarticle-Lancet.pdf| doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61579-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metrics==

Various metrics have been used to compare interventions. These include:

* [[Disability-adjusted life year]] per unit cost (used by e.g. [[Disease Control Priorities Project]]),&lt;ref name=rudan2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="glassman2012"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.gheart.2012.01.007| issn = 2211-8160| volume = 7| issue = 1| pages = 13–34| last1 = Glassman| first1 = Amanda| last2 = Chalkidou| first2 = Kalipso| last3 = Giedion| first3 = Ursula| last4 = Teerawattananon| first4 = Yot| last5 = Tunis| first5 = Sean| last6 = Bump| first6 = Jesse B.| last7 = Pichon-Riviere| first7 = Andres| title = Priority-Setting Institutions in Health| journal = Global Heart| accessdate = 2016-06-23| date = March 2012| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211816012000105}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quality-adjusted life year]], and other forms of [[cost-effectiveness analysis]]

* Adequacy of funding&lt;ref name=dcp2_ch4 /&gt;

==Who sets the priorities?==

Priority-setting can be done by various actors. These include:

* Governments: "In most countries, health spending by governments vastly outpaces international health aid, so governments set most health priorities."&lt;ref name="glassman2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Glassman%2011-13-13%20(public).pdf |title=A conversation with Amanda Glassman on November 13, 2013 |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=June 21, 2016 |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Non-profits and companies that assist governments
* If a country is using a [[Health in All Policy]] (HiAP) approach, then priority-setting is done by stakeholders who do not directly deal with health.&lt;ref name=pmac2016/&gt;
* International organizations
* Foundations
* Private donors (including [[high-net-worth individual]]s and ultra-high-net-worth individuals): "A common outcome is a negotiated set of priorities that reflect some domestic needs and some technical, political, and economic considerations defined largely by the interests of donors."&lt;ref name=glassman2012/&gt; In some highly aid-dependent countries, donors "have huge influence on health priorities".&lt;ref name=glassman2013/&gt;

According to Devi Sridhar, professor of global health at the [[University of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cphs.mvm.ed.ac.uk/people/staffProfile.php?profile=dsridhar |date=September 30, 2015 |title=Centre for Population Health Sciences - People |accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the priorities of funding bodies largely dictate what health issues and diseases are studied".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001312| issn = 1549-1676| volume = 9| issue = 9| pages = –1001312| last = Sridhar| first = Devi| title = Who Sets the Global Health Research Agenda?

==History of organizations and programs working on priority-setting==

According to [[Amanda Glassman]] et al., global-level priority-setting has occurred since at least the 1980s, though these efforts have only focused on a few aspects.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;

The following table is a timeline of organizations and programs working on priority-setting.

&lt;!-- Merge info from [[University_of_Toronto_Joint_Centre_for_Bioethics#Priority_Setting]]:

Priority setting, or resource allocation, is an important health policy issue that occurs at all levels of health care. The Joint Centre for Bioethics shares its research platform on priority setting with the Canadian Priority Setting Research Network, which aims to improve the politics and processes of health care priority setting and enhance the research capacity for priority setting. The centre takes an innovative approach to priority setting research in that the focus is placed on enhancing the priority setting processes, capturing and sharing actual priority setting experiences, and taking a bottom-up approach to improve priority setting.

==Reception==

{{cquote|text=The result of a myriad of actors championing a kaleidoscope of "priorities" is confusion. Advocates, researchers, and policy makers have labeled almost every disease, condition, medication, or intervention a "health priority."|author=Glassman et al.&lt;ref name=glassman2012/&gt;}}

Rudan et al. says that priority-setting efforts have relied on "consensus reached by panels of experts" and as a result have not been systematic enough, and that this has "often made it difficult to present the identified priorities to wider audiences as legitimate and fair".&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt;

[[Amanda Glassman|Glassman]] et al. notes that criticisms of priority-setting include "the weak data on which estimates of burden, cost, and effectiveness relied; the value judgments implicit in disability-adjusted life year age weighting and discounting decisions; and treatment of equity issues, as well as the political difficulties associated with translating a ground zero package into a public budget based on historical inputs"; and the consideration of only health maximization at the expense of other objectives such as fairness.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;{{rp|16}}

Glassman et al. also notes how there are more cost-effectiveness studies for LMICs (in the thousands), but that these are unlikely to be actually applied to priority-setting processes.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;{{rp|16}}

[[Jeremy Shiffman]] has said that some bodies such as the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] and ''[[The Lancet]]'' are prominent in priority-setting due to their dominion rather than data and analysis, and also notes that the process of creating the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] was not sufficiently transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.15171/ijhpm.2015.51| issn = 2322-5939| volume = 4| issue = 5| pages = 315–317| last = Levine| first = Ruth E.| title = Power in global health agenda-setting: the role of private funding| journal = International Journal of Health Policy and Management| date = 2015-03-04| pmid = 25905483| pmc = 4417636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public health funerals''' are funerals in the United Kingdom paid for by the local authority, where the relatives are either unwilling or unable to pay, or where no relatives can be found.

==England and Wales==

Public health funerals in England and Wales are governed by the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984.&lt;ref name=publichealthact/&gt; Local authorities are obliged to arrange a funeral where no arrangements are being made or have been made. Local authorities are permitted to recover the costs of such funerals from the estate of the deceased under the Act.

''[[The Guardian]]'' has reported that the average cost of a public health funeral is £950.&lt;ref name=guardian2012/&gt; In some circumstances where a person dies in hospital the relevant NHS trust may arrange a funeral for the deceased; however, ultimately the duty to arrange the funeral rests with the local authority.&lt;ref name=dohpatientbereavement/&gt;

==Northern Ireland==

Similar provisions to those in England and Wales exist in Northern Ireland under the Welfare Services Act (Northern Ireland) 1971. District councils are obligated to bury or cremate those who die in their area where no suitable provisions for disposal of the body have been made or are being made.&lt;ref name=welfareservicesactNI/&gt;

==Scotland==

In Scotland a duty is imposed on local authorities under the [[National Assistance Act 1948]] where the body of a person who has died or been found dead in their area and no suitable arrangements are being made for disposal of the body.&lt;ref name=nationalassistanceact/&gt; A local authority may also arrange a burial or cremation for any person who was in the care of or receiving assistance (as well as children in local authority care) from the authority immediately prior to their death.&lt;ref name=socialworkscotlandact/&gt; In both cases a local authority may seek to recover costs from the estate of the deceased.

549 funerals were undertaken in 2015 under the provisions above, costing local authorities approximately £500,000.&lt;ref name=bbc2016/&gt; These funerals are usually conducted by an undertaker contracted by the local authority to prepare the body and provide a basic funeral.&lt;ref name=citizensadvice2016/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3134">&lt;!-- EU documents use British English, since UK is a member state --&gt;
The '''[[European Union]]''' plays a minor and mostly indirect policy role in '''sport''', because (a) sport is normally considered to be outside the [[principle of conferral|competences conferred]] by the member states to the European Union and (b) sport is in general organised  internally, on a European continental level (which is not the same as the level of the European Union), or globally.

==Role of the EU==
=== Direct ===

The European Union has a very limited direct role in sport. The [[European Commission]] is composed of Directorates-General and several departments. Within the [[Directorate-General]] Education and Culture, is the Sport Unit, which is responsible for the following main areas:
* cooperation within the Commission and with other institutions on sport-related issues,
* cooperation with national and international sports institutions, organisations and federations,
* bilateral meetings with sports institutions and organisations and international sports federations. [http://ec.europa.eu/sport/index_en.htm]

One of the few specific measures in Sports was taken by Decision No. 291/2003/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] of 6 February 2003 that established the European Year of Education through Sport 2004.

The activities and initiatives undertaken during 2004 were organised at Community, transnational, national, regional and local level, and was sometimes co-financed by the Community. Activities compromised for instance financial support for transnational, national, regional or local initiatives to promote education through sport. [http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l35008.htm]

===Indirect===
Although not directed specifically at sport, many of the rules, policies and programmes of the European Union affect the sports world or are of interest to it.

In particular, the [[common market]] of the European Union creates the right for any EU citizen to move and work freely in another member state.  The landmark [[Bosman ruling]] confirmed that this right, when applied to professional athletes, forbids nationality quotas in sports leagues that affect EU citizens.  This has changed the face of professional sports in the EU, with top teams now collecting talent from all over Europe, and sometimes even fielding teams with no domestic players at all.

'''Strike 4 Repeal''' was an [[abortion rights]] protest in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on [[International Women's Day]] 2017 (Wednesday 8 March 2017). It called for a repeal of the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eight Amendment]] of the [[Constitution of Ireland]], which bans [[abortion]] in nearly all cases, by recognising "the right to life of the unborn".&lt;ref name="irishtimes-8-mar-2017"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/thousands-march-against-eighth-amendment-in-dublin-1.3002375|title=Thousands march against Eighth Amendment in Dublin|date=8 March 2017|first1=Elaine|last1=Edwards|first2=Rachel|last2=Flaherty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/irish-women-abortion-ban-strike-international-day-2017-republic-ireland-consitutional-amendment-a7617461.html|title=Irish women go on strike over the abortion ban|date=8 March 2017|first=Katie|last=Forster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/08/health/ireland-abortion-strike-womens-day/|publisher=CNN|title=#Strike4Repeal: Ireland protests abortion ban on International Women's Day

The protest was organised by Strike 4 Repeal, an ad-hoc, non-affiliated group of activists, academics, artists and trade unionists organising for abortion rights in Ireland. The main march was in [[Dublin]], with 10,000 people on [[O'Connell Bridge]],&lt;ref name="irishtimes-8-mar-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Irish Central|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/women-across-ireland-are-on-strike-for-international-women-s-day-here-s-why|title=Thousands of Strike 4 Repeal protests takeover O'Connell Bridge (VIDEO)|date=8 March 2017|first=Katie|last=Hickey}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later many outside other government buildings. Despite the name "strike" some people took paid holidays that day. There were also protests in Galway, Limerick, Cork &amp; other cities &amp; towns around Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun|url=https://www.thesun.ie/news/683815/powerful-scenes-as-throngs-of-women-gather-on-irish-streets-to-strike-4-repeal-on-international-womens-day/|title=Powerful scenes as thousands of women gather on Irish streets to Strike 4 Repeal on International Women’s Day|first=Emma|last=O'Rourke|date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://traleetoday.ie/kerry-choice-holds-strike-4-repeal-square/|newspaper=Tralee Today|date=10 March 2017|title=Kerry For Choice Holds ‘Strike 4 Repeal’ In The Square|first=Dermot|last=Crean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Cork Independent|url=http://www.corkindependent.com/news/topics/articles/2017/03/08/4136192-strike-4-repeal-actions-take-place-later-today/|title=Strike 4 Repeal actions take place later today|date=8 March 2017|first=Niamh Aine|last=Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest was also held outside the Irish Embassy in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/abroad/generation-emigration/we-re-striking-for-repeal-in-london-in-solidarity-with-our-sisters-in-ireland-1.3002461|title=‘We’re striking for Repeal in London in solidarity with our sisters in Ireland’|location=London|first=Claire|last=McGowran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was inspired by a similar [[Abortion in Poland#Black Protest|Black Protest]] in [[Poland]] several months earlier, which itself was inspired by the [[1975 Icelandic women's strike]].&lt;ref name="irishtimes-8-mar-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39183423?ocid=socialflow_twitter|title=Abortion in Ireland: The fight for choice|date=8 March 2017|first=Joel|last=Gunter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2017/01/30/strike-4-repeal/|publisher=[[Abortion Rights Campaign]]|date=20 January 2017|title=Strike 4 Repeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The march, and repeal movement, was criticised by some [[anti-abortion]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/why-the-repeal-the-eighth-march-will-backfire-1.3001535|title=Why the Repeal the Eighth march will backfire|date=8 March 2017|newspaper=The Irish Times|first=Larissa|last=Nolan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some participants thought the coverage of the event on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], Ireland's national broadcaster, was insufficient, and organised a follow-up picket of RTÉ studios. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=University Observer|url=http://www.universityobserver.ie/news/ucd-students-lead-rte-repeal-protest/|title=UCD Students Lead RTÉ Repeal Protest|date=13 March 2017|first=Roisin|last=Guyett-Nicholson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shemazing.net/repeal-protesters-set-to-picket-rte-to-demand-recognition-for-strike/|title=Repeal protesters set to picket RTÉ to demand recognition for strike|first=Sarah|last=Magliocco|date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/student-hub/ucd-students-organise-rt%C3%A9-repeal-protest-1.3009256|title=UCD students organise RTÉ 'Repeal protest'|date=13 March 2016|first=Roisin|last=Guyett-Nicholson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Irish government convened a [[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|Citizens' Assembly]] to make non-binding recommendations on this constitutional ban on abortion, and it was still deliberating on the day of the protest. {{As of|2017|03}} the Assembly hasn't finished its work. The protest also took place as details about the [[Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home]] in [[Tuam]] were being revealed, with some posters referencing those events.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"/&gt;

== Atomic bombing of Nagasaki ==
In early 1943, Taniguchi began working as a carrier for the Nishiura-Kami post office in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/peoplescentury/episodes/fallout/taniguchitranscript.html |title= Interview with Sumiteru Taniguchi Japanese Citizen, Nagasaki |accessdate=13 August 2007 |date= 15 June 1999 |work= People's Century: Fallout |publisher= PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 9 August 1945, the 16-year-old Taniguchi was {{convert|1800|m}} from the [[hypocenter]], delivering mail on his bicycle without a shirt on due to the warm summer weather, when "[[Fat Man]]" exploded in the sky over [[Urakami]]. The bomb's heat flash heavily injured Taniguchi with near instant burns resulting, but the blast that arrived afterward did not cause any severe injuries to him, as he clung to the ground while buildings were blown down around him.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tex"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.enigmaterial.com/dateline/hn_34/hn_34_02.html |title= ‘People were not like humans’ |accessdate=13 August 2007 |last= Sprangens |first= John, Jr. |date= 27 August 1979 |work= Corsicana (Texas) Daily Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy burns melted skin from his back and left arm, but Taniguchi states that he did not bleed or feel any pain due to the nerve endings being burned away.

Taniguchi's business card featured this photograph with the caption, "I want you to understand, if only a little, the horror of nuclear weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nrdwr.com/weblog/Joe/NOV-2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160312075709/http://nrdwr.com/weblog/joe/nov-2006 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 12 March 2016 |title= 6 months after the Nagasaki bomb |accessdate=13 August 2007 |date= 3 November 2006 |work= Mainichi Daily News }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Come nightfall Taniguchi was carried to a hill to rest, where he was surrounded by confused and thirsty survivors. The next morning everyone but Taniguchi was dead. During the next two days rescue teams passed by without noticing him, as he was too weak to muster a call for help.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; Taniguchi was finally rescued on 11 August and taken to a country clinic about 29&amp;nbsp;km (18 miles) away from Nagasaki. By mid-September he was moved to a primary school clinic in Nagasaki to receive the first course of medical treatment from a University Hospital team. The clinic was unsanitary and initial treatments proved inadequate as his wounds [[Hospital-acquired infection|became infected]] and worsened.&lt;ref name="THC" /&gt;

In November Taniguchi was transferred to [[Ōmura, Nagasaki|Omura]] Navy Hospital, where he spent the next 21 months lying on his stomach due to the severe burns on his back. During this time Taniguchi developed severe [[bedsores]] on his chest. As he recalls, "holes opened between my ribs and the movement of my heart and other organs became visible through the skin."&lt;ref name="THC" /&gt; In January 1946, U.S. Marine photographer [[Joe O'Donnell (photojournalist)|Joe O'Donnell]] snapped a picture of Taniguchi's back while recording the aftermath of the bombing in 50 Japanese cities; this photograph is now exhibited in museums as a graphic depiction of the injuries suffered by survivors of the bombings.&lt;ref name="THC" /&gt;

The color photograph(s) of Sumiteru Taniguchi's red back are from motion picture film taken by (attributed to) Lieutenant Herbert Sussan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uruknet.info/?p=80252|title=The Great Hiroshima Cover-Up—And the Greatest Movie Never Made|last=Mitchell|first=Greg|date=5 August 2011|website=Uruk Net|access-date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergeant Joe O'Donnell took an earlier black and white photograph and this is included in his book, ''Japan 1945: A U.S. Marine's Photographs from Ground Zero''.&lt;ref name="THC" /&gt;

By May 1947, Taniguchi could finally sit up, and on 20 March 1949, he was discharged from the Omura hospital.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; His wounds were not treated properly until 1960, however, and continued to cause him great physical discomfort until his death. The improper burn healing and to some degree the delayed [[stochastic]] effects of radiation exposure during and after the bombings manifested in the growth of numerous burn [[keloid]] tumors.

From 2007 until his death, Taniguchi had undergone ten surgeries to remove benign growths.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41094741|title=Nagasaki atomic bomb survivor Sumiteru Taniguchi dies at 88|date=30 August 2017|accessdate=30 August 2017|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
Taniguchi devoted his life to informing people of the consequences of the 1945 atomic bombing and campaigning against nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; He made frequent public appearances to speak to student groups and participate in demonstrations calling for [[nuclear disarmament]].&lt;ref name="Mainichi"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newser.com/story/247974/survivor-of-nagasaki-bomb-who-campaigned-to-ban-nukes-dies.html |title= Atomic Bomb Survivor Dies After Life Fighting to Ban Nukes |accessdate=30 August 2017 |date= 30 August 2017|work= Newser }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taniguchi gave numerous interviews recounting his experiences and was featured in [[Steven Okazaki]]'s 2007 documentary ''[[White Light/Black Rain: The Destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/whitelightblackrain/subjects.html|title=White Light, Black Rain: The Destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – Subject Bios|accessdate=13 August 2007|website=[[HBO]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522112505/http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/whitelightblackrain/subjects.html|archive-date=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unilever was founded on [[September 2nd]], 1929, by the merger of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] margarine producer [[Margarine Unie]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] soapmaker [[Lever Brothers]]. During the second half of the 20th century the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), [[Brooke Bond]] (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), [[Best Foods]] (2000), [[Ben &amp; Jerry's]] (2000), [[Alberto-Culver]] (2010), [[Dollar Shave Club]] (2016) and [[Pukka Herbs]] (2017). Unilever divested its speciality chemicals businesses to [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] in 1997.  In the 2010s, under leadership of [[Paul Polman]], the company started gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.&lt;ref name="boyle2014"&gt;{{cite news | author=Boyle, Matthew | author2=Jarvis, Paul | title=Unilever Spreads Split Boosts Chance of Exit as Shares Gain | date=4 December 2014 | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-04/unilever-plans-to-split-spreads-business-into-standalone-unit.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1870s–1910s===
In 1872, [[Antoon Jurgens]], founded the first margarine factory in the world in [[Oss]], [[Netherlands]]. Then, in 1888, [[Samuel van den Bergh]], also from Oss, opened his margarine factory in [[Kleve]]. These two companies merged in 1927 to form [[Margarine Unie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/55468705/ppl-n-org-rep|title=Organisation introduction|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Outside Lever House, Port Sunlight (2).jpg|thumb|Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers]]

The initial harvesting of palm oil was from [[British West Africa]], from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.&lt;ref name="pathe1"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.britishpathe.com/embed.php?archive=72631 |title=British Pathe News, Wealth of the World, 1950 |publisher=Britishpathe.com |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in [[Belgian Congo]], mostly south of [[Bandundu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Bandundu]], where a system of forced labour operated.&lt;ref&gt;Jules Marechal, "Travail forcé pour l'huile de palme de Lord Leverhulme L'Histoire du Congo 1910–1945". Part III. Editions Paula Bellings. pp.348–368.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s===

In 1925, Lever Brothers acquired [[Mac Fisheries]], owner of [[Wall's (meat)|T. Wall &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch [[Margarine Unie]] and British soapmaker [[Lever Brothers]], with the name of the resulting company a [[portmanteau]] of the name of both companies.&lt;ref name="Unilever global company website"&gt;[http://www.unilever.com/about/who-we-are/our-history/1920-1929.html http://www.unilever.com/about/who-we-are/our-history/1920-1929.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725211548/http://www.unilever.com/about/who-we-are/our-history/1920-1929.html |date=25 July 2015 }}, Unilever website, about section, 1920-1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s–1940s===
In the 1930s, business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.&lt;ref name="Wubs154"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Wubs|title=International Business and National War Interests: Unilever Between Reich and Empire, 1939-45|date=11 June 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-11652-2|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, it acquired [[Thomas Lipton|T. J. Lipton]], a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the [[Birds Eye]] brand) and [[Batchelors Peas]], one of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/Acquisitions%20and%20Firm%20Growth.pdf|title=Acquisitions and firm growth: Creating Unilever's ice cream and tea business|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/Corporate%20venturing_%20the%20origins%20of%20Unilever's%20pregnancy%20test_57e69cb9-7d58-4298-9dbb-58041552ae25.pdf|title=Corporate venturing: the origins of Unilever's pregnancy test|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, [[Pepsodent]] was acquired.&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"/&gt;

After 1945, Unilever's once successful US businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; As a result, Unilever began to operate a "hands off" policy towards the subsidiaries, and left American management to its own devices.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===1950s–1960s===
Sunsilk was first launched in the UK in 1954.&lt;ref name="ThainBradley426"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Greg Thain|author2=John Bradley|title=FMCG: The Power of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i8MABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA426|date=11 July 2014|publisher=First Edition Design Pub.|isbn=978-1-62287-647-1|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.&lt;ref name="ThainBradley426" /&gt; Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.&lt;ref name="HensmansJohnson139"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Manuel Hensmans|author2=Gerry Johnson|author3=George Yip|title=Strategic Transformation: Changing While Winning|date=8 January 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-26845-7|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US-based [[Good Humor]] ice cream business was acquired in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unilever.co.uk/aboutus/ourhistory/1960s/|title=1960 - 1969|work=unilever.co.uk|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s, laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; However, a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter &amp; Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based [[Lipton|Lipton Ltd]] from [[Allied Suppliers]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 1978, [[National Starch]] was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.&lt;ref name="HensmansJohnson140"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Manuel Hensmans|author2=Gerry Johnson|author3=George Yip|title=Strategic Transformation: Changing While Winning|date=8 January 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-26845-7|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate affairs==

===Legal structure===
[[File:Unilever_Head_Office_Building_Rotterdam.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Unilever N.V. head office building in Rotterdam]]
Unilever has two holding companies: Unilever N.V., which has its registered and head office in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and Unilever plc, which has its registered office at [[Port Sunlight]] in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at [[Unilever House]] in London, United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=corpgov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unilever.com/images/The-Governance-of-Unilever-10-01-12_tcm13-216301.pdf |title=Governance of Unilever – 1 January 2012 |accessdate=9 April 2012 |publisher=Unilever |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030193248/http://www.unilever.com/images/The-Governance-of-Unilever-10-01-12_tcm13-216301.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. and their subsidiary companies operate as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, whilst remaining separate legal entities with different shareholders and separate stock exchange listings.&lt;ref name=corpgov/&gt;

There are a series of legal agreements between the parent companies, together with special provisions in their respective Articles of Association, which are known as the Foundation Agreements.&lt;ref name=corpgov/&gt; A key requirement of the agreements is that the same people be on the Boards of the two parent companies. An Equalisation Agreement regulates the mutual rights of shareholders in Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. with the objective of ensuring that, in principle, it does not make any financial difference to hold shares in Unilever plc rather than Unilever N.V. (and vice versa).&lt;ref name=corpgov/&gt;

====Future====
On 15 March 2018, Unilever announced its intention to simplify this structure by centralising the duality of legal entities and keeping just one headquarters in Rotterdam, abandoning the London head office. Business groups and staff are unaffected, as is the dual listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/unilever-moves-headquarters-rotterdam-london-brexit-100-years-a8256736.html|title=Unilever, Britain's third biggest company, moves headquarters to Rotterdam after 100 years in London|date=15 March 2018|work=The Independent|access-date=15 March 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2018 the group announced it would cancel the restructuring due to concern that the UK shareholders would lose value if the company fell out of the London FTSE100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7c1cabf4-c864-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9|title=Unilever backs down on plan to move headquarters from UK|last=Abboud|first=Leila|date=2018-10-05|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2019, [[Alan Jope]] will succeed Paul Polman as the chief executive officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/world-news/unilever-boss-paul-polman-steps-down-after-10-years-37577160.html|title=Unilever boss Paul Polman steps down after 10 years|last=Key|first=Alys|date=2018-11-29|website=Irish Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo==
In 1930, the logo of Unilever was in a sans-serif typeface and all-caps. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by [[Wolff Olins]], a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logodesignlove.com/unilever-icons |title=Unilever icons explained |publisher=Logodesignlove.com |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolffolins.com/work/unilever |title=Unilever case study |publisher=Wolff Olins |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==

=== Dove ===
Dove describes itself as being dedicated to "help&amp;nbsp;... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential". (Dove, "Our Vision")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mydove.com.au/en/Our-Mission/Our-Vision/default.aspx|title=Our Vision|work=mydove.com.au|accessdate=21 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228221735/http://www.mydove.com.au/en/Our-Mission/Our-Vision/default.aspx|archivedate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign, focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007 this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly, and that women's ageing process was something to be ashamed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimnonline.org/articles/dovebacklash.html|title=WIMN - Dove's "Real Beauty" Backlash|work=wimnonline.org|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lynx/Axe ===
Axe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of 16 and 24.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/nov/20/marketingandpr|title=Lynx marketing campaign|author=Claire Cozens|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products.&lt;ref name="bbcdirtier"&gt;{{cite news|title='Offensive' Lynx adverts banned by advertising watchdog|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15849142|accessdate=22 February 2017|work=BBC News|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodionova|first1=Zlata|title=Unilever, the owner of Magnum and Lynx, vows to end gender stereotyping in its adverts|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uniliver-the-owner-of-magnum-and-lynx-vows-to-end-gender-stereotyping-in-its-adverts-a7097686.html|accessdate=22 February 2017|work=The Independent|date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Dove's long running beauty campaign Lynx advertising often creates mini series of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. This campaign thrives on controversy. Using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012 Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. This advert designed for television shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls. In 2011 in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned. The poster for Lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach, with the headline: "The cleaner you are the dirtier you get."&lt;ref name="bbcdirtier" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASA Ruling on Unilever UK Ltd|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/11/Unilever-UK-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_166988.aspx|publisher=[[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]]|accessdate=22 February 2017|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays women as hypersexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by men, of all ages and stature, for their use of the Lynx product. Their target audience is single men between the ages of 16-24.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

==Environmental record==
Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by: halving the [[environmental footprint]] of its products over the next 10 years; helping 1&amp;nbsp;billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living-2014/ |publisher=Unilever| title= Sustainable Living Plan|date= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palm oil===
Unilever has been criticised by [[Greenpeace]] for causing [[deforestation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/press-releases/unilever-admits-toxic-dumping-will-clean-up-but-not-come-clean|publisher=Greenpeace|title=Unilever admits toxic dumping: will clean up but not come clean|accessdate=7 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508042719/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/press-releases/unilever-admits-toxic-dumping-will-clean-up-but-not-come-clean|archivedate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unilever was targeted in 2008 by Greenpeace UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7358071.stm|title= Ape protest at Unilever factory|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which criticised the company for buying [[palm oil]] from suppliers that are damaging Indonesia's rainforests.&lt;ref name="Palm Oil: Cooking the Climate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Palm Oil: Cooking the Climate|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/palm-oil_cooking-the-climate/|publisher=GREENPEACE|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of [[deforestation in Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="Palm Oil: Cooking the Climate"/&gt;

Furthermore, Indonesia was the fourteenth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts1990-2014&amp;sort=des9|title=EDGAR - GHG (CO2, CH4, N2O, F-gases) emission time series 1990-2012 per region/country - European Commission|website=edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu|access-date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace International"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Unilever Palm Oil Suppliers are Burning Up Borneo|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/planet-2/report/2009/10/how-unilever-palm-oil-supplier.pdf|publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Greenpeace]], palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace International"/&gt;  Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace International"/&gt;

Unilever, as a founding member of the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unilever.com/mediacentre/pressreleases/2008/Unilevercommitstocertifiedsustainablepalmoil.aspx |title=Unilever commits to certified sustainable palm oil &amp;#124; Media centre &amp;#124; Unilever Global |publisher=Unilever.com |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100%  sustainable by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.unilever.com/Images/palm-oil-sourcing-position-statement_tcm244-423162_1.pdf | title=Unilever's Position on Palm Oil SOurcing | accessdate=7 August 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918215250/https://www.unilever.com/Images/palm-oil-sourcing-position-statement_tcm244-423162_1.pdf | archivedate=18 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Côte d'Ivoire ([[Ivory Coast]]), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a [[primate]] species, [[Miss Waldron's red colobus]]. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.manifeste-fmt.org/updates.php | title=Manifesto for the Conservation of the Tanoé Swamps Forest | accessdate=19 July 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121162000/http://www.manifeste-fmt.org/updates.php | archivedate=21 November 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]] in 2016 Unilever palm oil provider [[Wilmar International]] profited from 8 to 14 year old [[child labor]] and [[forced labor]]. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from banned chemicals. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was the world’s biggest palm oil grower.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/5184/2016/en/ THE GREAT PALM OIL SCANDAL: LABOUR ABUSES BEHIND BIG BRAND NAMES] Amnesty International 30 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper use===
For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from [[Asia Pulp &amp; Paper]], the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labelled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.&lt;ref name="Paper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone.

===Rainforest Alliance===
Unilever certifies its tea products by the [[Rainforest Alliance]] scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over [[Fairtrade]], because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  url=http://www.dutchsustainabletrade.com/site/getfile.php?id=153 |  title=Unilever sustainable tea Part 1: Leapfrogging to mainstream |  accessdate=15 March 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism====
{{Main article|Rainforest Alliance#Criticism and response}}
The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,&lt;ref&gt;Ethical Corporation (January 2005).

The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has however [[Fair trade debate|received similar criticism]] as well. The Rainforest Alliance certification [[Rainforest Alliance#Use of seal|has furthermore been criticised]] for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.&lt;ref name="transfairusa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transfairusa.org/content/about/board.php |title=TransFair USA &amp;#124; Board Members |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=27 June 2009 |accessdate=29 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109100107/http://www.transfairusa.org/content/about/board.php |archivedate=9 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mercury Contamination ===
A mercury thermometer factory operated by the Indian subsidiary of Unilever in the South Indian hilltown of Kodaikanal was shut down by state regulators in 2001 after the company was caught for dumping toxic mercury wastes in a densely populated part of town. By the company’s own admissions, more than 2 tonnes of mercury have been discharged into Kodaikanal’s environment. A 2011 [[Ministry of Labour and Employment (India)|Government of India]] [http://kodaimercury.org/final-report-of-the-goi-committee/ study] on workers’ health concluded that many workers suffered from illnesses caused by workplace exposure to mercury. The scandal opened up a series of issues in India such as [[corporate liability]], [[corporate accountability]] and corporate negligence.

The mercury contamination in [[Kodaikanal]] originated at a [[thermometer]] factory that was owned by [[Hindustan Unilever]]. Unilever acquired the thermometer factory from cosmetics maker [[Pond's|Pond's India Ltd.]] Pond's moved the factory from the United States to India in 1982 after the plant owned there by its parent, Chesebrough-Pond's, had to be dismantled following increased awareness in developed countries of polluting industries. In 1987, Pond's India and the thermometer factory went to Hindustan Unilever when it acquired Cheseborough-Pond's globally.

The factory imported mercury from the United States, and exported finished thermometers to markets in the United States and Europe. Around 2001, a number of workers at the factory began complaining of [[kidney]] and related ailments. Public interest groups such as Tamil Nadu Alliance Against Mercury (TNAAC) alleged that the Company had been disposing mercury waste without following proper protocols. In early 2001, public interest groups unearthed a pile of broken glass thermometers with remains of Mercury from an interior of part of the [[shola]] forest, which they suspected could have come from the company. In March 2001, a public protest led by local workers' union and international environmental organisation [[Greenpeace]] forced the company to shut down the factory. Soon the company admitted that it did dispose of mercury contaminated waste. The company said in its 2002 annual report and its latest Sustainability Report that it did not dump glass waste contaminated with mercury on the land behind its factory, but only a quantity of 5.3 metric tonnes of glass containing 0.15% residual mercury had been sold to a scrap recycler located about three kilometers from the factory, in breach of the company procedures. Quoting a report prepared by an international environmental consultant, Unilever said there was no health effect on the workers of the factory or any impact on the environment.

However, in March 2016 Unilever reached an out of court settlement (for an undisclosed amount) with 591 ex-workers of the unit who had sued the company for knowingly exposing them to the toxic element. This was subsequent to the launch of a music video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSal-ms0vcI Kodaikanal Won’t], which received over 3 million hits and a global petition to the Unilever CEO [[Paul Polman]] signed by over 150,000 people in over 100 countries. 

Unilever simultaneously announced its plan to remediate the mercury contaminated soils inside the factory premises. A [http://kodaimercury.org/urs-dames-and-more-report/ 2002 report] by Unilever's consultant, [[URS Corporation|URS Dames &amp; Moore]] found elevated concentrations of mercury (0.031mg/L or 31 ug/L and 0.085 mg/L or 85 ug/L) in two surface water samples that were collected on site following a heavy storm. The samples mentioned in the report were 40 and 110 times higher than the levels recommended by [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] for freshwater, and between 3100 times and 8500 times higher than [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|USEPA]] recommendation for water quality if humans consume fish from the river segment in question. Furthermore, a [http://kodaimercury.org/backdoor/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DAE_Study.pdf 2002 study] by a [[Department of Atomic Energy]] laboratory of the [[Government of India]] found that mercury levels in air near the factory were above nominal levels by between 132 and 660 times. 

The company initiated a trial clean up of the soils between September and November 2017 during which it attempted to remediate 87 tons of soils. The remediation proposal has challenged by the local communities and activists for being in violation of international best standards. 

===July - September 2016 salmonella affair===
==== Salmonella affair in cereals in Israel ====

In July 2016, rumours about [[salmonella]] contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4834118,00.html|title=Where have all the cornflakes gone?|work=ynet|date=28 July 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On the night of 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarker.com/advertising/1.3020532|title=מה גרם ליוניליוור לעצור את שיווקן של אלפי אריזות דגני בוקר?|first=עדי|last=דברת-מזריץ|date=27 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016|via=TheMarker}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July, [[Yediot Ahronot]] reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/215664 | work=Israel National News| title=Contamination feared in Israeli cornflakes|date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all [[cornflakes]] made by Unilever.&lt;ref name=ynet&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4834457,00.html |title=Salmonella in cornflakes: 'I don't trust Unilever products anymore' |work=[[ynetnews]]|date=28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarker.com/advertising/1.3024608|title=הזיהום בקורנפלקס: יוניליוור מסרבת לחשוף תאריכי הייצור וכמה אלימים החיידקים|first1=עדי|last1=דברת-מזריץ|first2=צבי|last2=זרחיה|date=1 August 2016|work=themarker.com|accessdate=9 November 2016|via=TheMarker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2016, ''[[Globes]]'' reported that the company has published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: "We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this production series are returned, confirming that all is well.

On 7 August, ''Globes'' reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic ("without human hands") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001144517|title=האם קורנפלקס של יוניליוור בא במגע עם לשלשת יונים או הפרשות עובד?|date=8 August 2016|work=Globes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until Unilever carry out a number of corrections; the action came after an inspection of the [[Arad, Israel|Arad]] plant, stating "This was a series of negligent mistakes, and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/health-ministry-salmonella-tainted-cornflakes-plant-was-negligent/|title=Unilever has license suspended for selling Salmonella-tainted cornflakes|date=8 August 2016|work=[[Times of Israel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.walla.co.il/item/2992992|title=חשד נוסף לסלמונלה: ספק טחינה גדול הודיע על החזרת מוצרים - וואלה! חדשות|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wine and food matching''' is the process of pairing [[food]] dishes with [[wine]] to enhance the dining experience. In many cultures, wine has had a long history of being a [[Staple food|staple]] at the dinner table and in some ways both the [[winemaking]] and [[culinary]] traditions of a region will have evolved together over the years. Rather than following a set of rules, local cuisines were paired simply with local wines. The modern "[[art]]" of food pairings is a relatively recent phenomenon, fostering an industry of books and media with guidelines for pairings of particular foods and wine. In the [[restaurant]] industry, [[sommelier]]s are often present to make food pairing recommendations for the guest. The main concept behind pairings is that certain elements (such as texture and flavor) in both food and wine interact with each other, and thus finding the right combination of these elements will make the entire dining experience more enjoyable. However, taste and enjoyment are very [[subjectivity|subjective]] and what may be a "[[textbook]] perfect" pairing for one taster could be less enjoyable to another.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 83-88"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 83-88 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are many books, magazines and websites with detailed guidelines on how to pair food and wine, most food and wine experts believe that the most basic element of food and wine pairing is understanding the balance between the "weight" of the food and the weight (or [[body (wine)|body]]) of the wine. Heavy, robust wines like [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] can overwhelm a light, delicate dish like a [[quiche]], while light-bodied wines like [[Pinot Grigio]] would be similarly overwhelmed by a hearty [[stew]]. Beyond weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented. From there a food and wine pairing can also take into consideration the [[sugar (wine)|sugar]], [[acid (wine)|acid]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[tannin (wine)|tannin]]s of the wine and how they can be accentuated or minimized when paired with certain types of food.&lt;ref name="Oldman pg 219-235"&gt;M. Oldman ''"Oldman's Guide to Outsmarting Wine" pg 219-235 Penguin Books 2004 {{ISBN|0-14-200492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Annibale Carracci The Beaneater.jpg|left|thumb|For most of history, wine has been a regular accompaniment to meals. Often the culinary and winemaking traditions of a region would evolve together, creating a natural pairing between the local wine and the local cuisine.]]
Wine has had a long history of being served as an accompaniment to food. The early [[history of wine]] has it origins as another dietary staple and a beverage that was often more sanitary than the local water supply. There is little evidence that much serious thought was given to pairing particular dishes to particular wines with most likely whatever wine was available being used. However, as culinary traditions in a region developed, so too did local winemaking tradition.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 83-88"/&gt;

Many pairings that are considered "classics" today emerged from the centuries-old relationship between a region's cuisine and their wines. In Europe, [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] was a staple meat of the diet for many areas that today are leading [[wine region]]s. The red wines of regions such as [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]], [[Greece (wine)|Greece]], [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]], [[Ribera del Duero]], [[Rhone (wine)|Rhone]] and [[Provence (wine)|Provence]] are considered classic pairings with the lamb dishes found in the local cuisines of those regions. In [[Italy (wine)|Italy]], the intimate connection between food and wine is deeply embedded in the culture and is exemplified by the country's wine. Historically, Italians rarely dined without wine and a region's wine was crafted to be "food friendly", often with bright acidity. While some Italian wines may seem tannic, lean or tart by themselves they often will show a very different profile when paired with boldly flavored Italian foods.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 255 &amp; 318"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 255 &amp; 318 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some historical [[anecdote]]s that have related to food and wine pairing before modern times. One anecdote often attributed to British wine merchants is ''"Buy on an [[apple]] and sell on [[cheese]]"'' meaning that if a wine tastes good when paired with a raw, uncooked apple it must be truly good and pairing any wine with cheese will make it more palatable to the average consumer and easier to sell. The principles behind this anecdote lies in the food pairing properties of both fruit and cheeses. Fruits that are high in sugar and acidity (such as the [[malic acid]] in green apples) can make wines taste metallic and thin bodied. In contrast, hard cheeses such as [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]] can soften the tannins in wines and make them taste fuller and fruitier.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 277-278"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 277-278 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another historical anecdote, still repeated today, is ''"White wine with fish; Red wine with meat"''.  The root of this [[adage]] rests on the principle of matching the body (weight) of the wine with the weight of the food. Meat was generally heavier and "red" in color so it was assumed that a red wine (which was usually heavier than white wine) paired better. Similarly fish was generally light and "white" in color so it was often paired with white wine. This adage has become outdated somewhat due to the variety of wine styles prevalent in modern winemaking where there are now many "heavy" white wines such as "[[New World (wine)|New World]]" [[oak (wine)|oaky]] [[Chardonnay]] that can have more body than lighter reds such as [[Pinot noir]] or Italian [[Merlot]]s.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 107"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 107 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another older idea was "to pair strong cheeses with strong wines," for example, [[Asiago cheese|asiago]], a sharply flavored cheese, with [[zinfandel]], a dark red wine with fruit tones.&lt;ref name="Say Cheese"&gt;Engleman, Peter, "Say Cheese!", ''New York Lawyer'', January 2001, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
[[Image:Sommelier e Tastevin.jpg|right|thumb|In hotels and restaurants, sommeliers are taught to recommend wine pairings to go with the restaurant's fare.]]
In recent years, the popularity and interest in food and wine pairings have increased and taken on new connotations. Industries have sprung up with print publications and media dedicated to expounding on the principles and ideals of pairing the perfect wine with the perfect dish. In the restaurant industry, there is often a dedicated individual or staff of sommeliers who are trained to recommend wine pairings with the restaurant's fare. The origins of this recent phenomenon can be traced to the [[United States]] in the 1980s when the wine industry began to advertise wine-drinking as a component of dining rather than as just an alcoholic beverage meant for consumption and intoxication. Winemakers started to emphasize the kind of food dishes that their wines would go well with, some even printing pairing suggestions on back [[wine label]]s. Food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 83-88"/&gt;

Today there are multiple sources for detailed guidelines and tips on food and wine pairing. But many wine drinkers select wine pairings based on instinct, the mood of the meal or simply a desire to drink a particular wine at the moment they desire to eat a particular meal.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 83-88"/&gt; The subjective nature of taste makes it possible to drink any kind of wine with any kind of food and have an enjoyable experience. Wine expert [[Mark Oldman]] has noted ''"Food and Wine pairing can be like [[sex]] and [[pizza]]: even when it's bad, it can still be pretty good"'' and gives the example of [[wedding cake]] with a [[dry (wine)|dry]] [[sparkling wine]]. A very dry wine with a very sweet food is, according to Oldman, ''"the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard"'' and is not a "good pairing" according to most guidelines but the atmosphere of the occasion and the subjective nature of taste can trump any rule or guideline.&lt;ref name="Oldman pg 219-235"/&gt; Today, many wine experts and advocates in the realm of food and wine pairing try to focus on the more objective physical aspects of food that have an effect on the palate, altering (or enhancing) the perception of various aspects of the wine.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 277-278"/&gt;

==Matching weight==
In food and wine pairings, the most basic element considered is "weight"-the balance between the weight of the food (a heavy, red sauce pasta versus a more delicate salad) and the weight or "body" of the wine (a heavy Cabernet Sauvignon versus a more delicate Pinot grigio). In [[wine tasting]], body is determined primarily by the [[alcohol level]] of the wine and can be influenced by the perceptions of tannins (from the grape skins or [[oak (wine)|oak]]) and extract (the dissolved solids in the wine derived from winemaking processes like extended [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] and [[lees (fermentation)|sur lie]] aging). An oaked Chardonnay from a warm wine region, such as [[Australia (wine)|Australia]] will be "heavier" in body than a stainless steel fermented Chardonnay from a cooler wine region such as [[Chablis (wine)|Chablis]]. Pairing heavy wines with light dishes or vice versa, can result in one partner overwhelming the other.&lt;ref name="Goldstein pg 14-27"&gt;E. Goldstein ''"Perfect Pairings"'' pg 14-27 University of California Press 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-520-24377-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "weight" of a food can also be described in terms of the intensity of its flavors-such as delicate and more subtle flavors versus dishes that have more robust and hearty flavors.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 83-88"/&gt; A key to pairing upon this principle is to identify the dominant flavor of the dish. Sauces can be the dominant flavor instead of the meat or main component. While poached fish is usually light bodied and better served with a light white, if the fish is served with a heavy cream sauce it could be better balanced with a fuller bodied white wine or light red.&lt;ref name="Oldman pg 219-235"/&gt;

===Weights of wine===
[[Image:GruenerVeltlinerWeissenkirchen.jpg|right|thumb|Gruner Veltliner is often made as a light bodied wine.]]
Below is a rough guideline of the various weights of wines. Winemaker and regional style as well as [[oak (wine)|oak treatment]] can cause a wine to be lighter or heavier in body. For example, Pinot noir can vary from being very light to more medium bodied. Another example is the influence of regional climates. Warmer climate wine regions tend to produce wines with higher alcohol levels and thus more fuller bodied wines so that a [[Sauvignon blanc]] from [[California (wine)|California]] may have a heavier weight than a Sauvignon blanc from the [[Loire (wine)|Loire]].&lt;ref name="Oldman pg 219-235"/&gt;

'''Lighter whites'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Heavier reds'''&lt;br&gt;
[[Syrah]], [[Brunello di Montalcino]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Port (wine)|Port]], [[Barbaresco]] and [[Barolo]]

===Focus of the pairing===
While a perfect balance where both food and wine are equally enhanced is theoretically possible, typically a pairing will have a more enhancing influence on one or the other. [[Master Sommelier]] Evan Goldstein notes that food and wine pairing is like two people having a conversation: ''"One must listen while the other speaks or the result is a muddle".'' This means either the food or the wine will be the dominant focus of the pairing, with the other serving as a complement to enhance the enjoyment of the first. In regards to weight and intensity, if the focus of the pairing is the wine then a more ideal balance will be a food that is slightly lighter in weight to where it will not compete for attention with the wine but not too light to where it is completely overwhelmed. If the focus of the pairing is to highlight a dish then the same thought would apply in pairing a wine.&lt;ref name="Goldstein pg 14-27"/&gt;

==Complement and contrast==
[[Image:Champagne.jpg|right|thumb|The racy acidity of sparkling wine and the rich texture of [[foie gras]] is an example of a contrasting pairing.]]
After considering weight, pairing the flavors and texture can be dealt with using one of two main strategies &amp;mdash; complement or contrast.

The first strategy tries to bring wine together with dishes that complement each other such as an earthy, Burgundian Pinot noir with an earthy, mushroom dish.

The second strategy operates under the truism that "opposites attract" and brings together food and wine that have contrasting traits such as a crisp, acidic Sauvignon blanc and a fish with a creamy lemon sauce. The crisp acidity of the wine serves as a contrast that can cut through the creaminess of the sauce and give a different, refreshing sensation for the palate as opposed to what a complementary pairing, such as a creamy, buttery Chardonnay, would bring. For most of history, the "complementary strategy" was the prevailing thought on food and wine pairing. In the 1980s, as more people started to discover and experiment with pairings, the idea of using contrast started to gain more favor. It follows the same idea that the "salty/sweet" pairing does in cooking (such as salty peanut butter with sweet jelly).&lt;ref name="Goldstein pg 14-27"/&gt;

The same food may be complemented ''or'' contrasted: a hard, nutty cheese such as [[Hirtenkase]] should have "a nutty, slightly sweet wine with it,"&lt;ref name="SF Gate"&gt;A reviewer at the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote, "I want a nutty, slightly sweet wine with [[Hirtenkase|it]], such as an oloroso [[sherry]] or a [[Madeira]]." Janet Fletcher, "Cheese Course: Hirtenkäse fans party when the cows come home," ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', February [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/15/WIMQUSGJ7.DTL SF Gate website]. Accessed March 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''or'' a full bodied red wine.{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2010}}[http://www.igourmet.com/St/recipe_view.asp?ID=15694 iGourmet website]. Accessed March 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties of wine==
While it is often said that "taste is subjective", there are quantifiable taste characteristics (like [[Taste#Bitterness|bitter]], [[sweet]], [[Taste#Saltiness|salty]] or [[sour]]) that can be perceived and measured as low, moderate or high—such as measuring the sweetness of honey or the saltiness of oysters. Flavors, such as butterscotch, char and strawberry, are more personal and can't be quantifiable. Flavors are either perceived to be present or not. The perception of flavors is linked to our sense of smell, while tastes come from the sensory glands of the [[taste bud]]s. Though individual sensitivity to the different taste "senses" can vary, wine experts will often recommend pairings based on these more objective measurements rather than the more subjective concept of "flavors". In wine there are three basic tastes-bitter, sweet and sour. These three tastes can each be identified with a primary component of the wine-tannins (bitter), [[residual sugar]] (sweet) and acidity (sour). A fourth component, alcohol, is identified in wine tasting with a perception of "heat" or hotness in the back of the mouth and is the primary factor influencing the body of the wine. The residual heat of the alcohol can be considered in food pairing with some ingredients minimizing the heat of the wine while some will accentuate it.&lt;ref name="Goldstein pg 14-27"/&gt;

===Acidity===
[[Image:Beaujolais salad.jpg|left|thumb|The acidity of salad dressing and tomatoes can cancel some of the tartness in a Beaujolais wine, allowing the fruit to be more noticeable.]]
Acidity is a dominant player in any food and wine pairing due to the pronounced and complex ways that it can heighten the perception of flavors. In wine tasting, acidity is perceived by a mouth watering response by the [[salivary gland]]s. This mouth watering can also serve to stimulate the appetite. In wine there are three main acids that have their own associated flavors-malic (green apples), [[lactic acid|lactic]] (milky) and [[tartaric acid|tartaric]] (bitter). In dishes that are fatty, oily, rich or salty, acidity in wine can "cut" (or standout and contrast) through the heaviness and be a refreshing change of pace on the palate. In cooking, acidity is often used in similar fashions such as a lemon wedges with a briny seafood dish such as oysters. The acidity of the lemon juices can make the oysters seem less briny. A wine that is less tart than the dish it is served with will taste thin and weak. A wine that comes across as "too tart" on its own may seem softer when paired with an acidic and tart dish. The complementing "tartness" of the food and wine cancels each other out and allows the other components (fruit of the wine, other flavors of the food) to be more noticeable.&lt;ref name="Goldstein pg 14-27"/&gt;

===Sweetness===
The sweetness of wines is determined by the amount of [[residual sugar]] left in the wine after the [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] process. Wines can be bone dry (with the sugars fully fermented into alcohol), off-dry (with a hint of sweetness), semi-dry (medium-sweet) and dessert level sweetness (such as the high sugar content in [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] and [[Tokaji|Tokay]]s). Sweet wines often need to be sweeter than the dish they are served with. Vintage brut [[champagne]] paired with sweet, [[wedding cake]] can make the wine taste tart and weak while the cake will have off flavors. In food pairings, sweetness balances spice and heat. It can serve as a contrast to the heat and alleviate some of the burning sensation caused by [[Jalapeño|peppers]] and [[spices]], e.g. in [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] or [[Sichuan cuisine]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein pg 14-27"/&gt; It can accentuate the mild sweetness in some foods and can also contrast with salt such as the European custom of pairing salty [[Stilton cheese]] with a sweet [[Port wine|Port]].&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 83-88"/&gt; Sweetness in a wine can balance tartness in food, especially if the food has some sweetness (such as dishes with [[sweet &amp; sour sauce]]s).&lt;ref name="Oldman pg 219-235"/&gt;

===Bitterness===
[[Image:Wine &amp; cheese reception 0120 - MicroTAS 2007.jpg|right|thumb|The [[protein]]s and [[fat]]s in [[cheese]] can soften the perception of [[tannin (wine)|tannin]]s in wine, making a wine seem less bitter and more fruity.]]
The astringency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267003013461 | doi=10.1016/j.aca.2003.10.017 | volume=513 | title=Taste and mouth-feel properties of different types of tannin-like polyphenolic compounds and anthocyanins in wine | year=2004 | journal=Analytica Chimica Acta | pages=57–65 | last1 = Vidal | first1 = Stéphane | last2 = Francis | first2 = Leigh | last3 = Noble | first3 = Ann | last4 = Kwiatkowski | first4 = Mariola | last5 = Cheynier | first5 = Véronique | last6 = Waters | first6 = Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with wine is usually derived from a wine's tannins. Tannins add a gritty texture and chalky, astringent taste. It can enhance the perception of "body" or weight in the wine. Tannins are normally derived from the skins, seeds, and stems of the grapes themselves (leeched out during the maceration process) or from contact with oak during barrel aging. Tannins react with [[proteins]]. When paired with dishes that are high in proteins and fats (such as red meat and hard cheeses), the tannins will bind to the proteins and come across as softer. In the absence of protein from the food, such as some [[vegetarian]] dishes, the tannins will react with the proteins on the tongue and sides of the mouth—accentuating the astringency and having a drying effect on the palate. Various cooking methods, such as [[grilling]] and [[blackening (cooking)|blackening]] can add a bitter "char" component to the dish that will allow it to play well with a tannic wine. While [[fish oils]] can make tannic wines taste metallic or off.&lt;ref name="Goldstein pg 14-27"/&gt; Astringent tannic wines like Barolo and Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm a lot of foods but can be soften by fatty foods with a lot of proteins such as hard cheeses or meats. The dry tannins also serve as a cleansing agent on the palate by binding to the grease and oils left over in the mouth. Spicy and sweet foods can accentuate the dry, bitterness of tannins and make the wine seem to have off flavors.&lt;ref name="Oldman pg 219-235"/&gt;

===Alcohol===
Alcohol is the primary factor in dictating a wine's weight and body. Typically the higher the alcohol level, the more weight the wine has. An increase in alcohol content will increase the perception of density and texture. In food and wine pairing, salt and spicy heat will accentuate the alcohol and the perception of "heat" or hotness in the mouth.&lt;ref name="Goldstein pg 14-27"/&gt; Conversely, the alcohol can also magnify the heat of spicy food making a highly alcoholic wine paired with a very spicy dish one that will generate a lot of heat for the taster.&lt;ref name="Oldman pg 219-235"/&gt;

==Other pairing principles==
Beyond the basic guidelines listed above, food pairings can dive even further into matching several layers of texture and flavors. The term "bridge ingredients" refers to ingredients and flavors that have certain affinities in wine pairing (such as slow-cooked onions with creamy wines, etc.). It can also refer to using particular herbs and spices perceived in the wine (such as [[rosemary]] in some Cabernet Sauvignon) and adding them to the dish as an ingredient. Their presence in a dish may increase the likelihood that the certain wines will pair well.&lt;ref name="Goldstein pg 14-27"/&gt;

The above principles can be used for pairing wines with Asian cuisine. Pair for the flavor of the dish - whatever the 'main ingredient' may be - it is not the meat, seafood, or vegetables that stand out as the predominant flavor. Rather the true flavor of the dish is determined by the cooking method (for example, the toasty flavors of a stir fry), the sauce (from curries to sweet-and-sour), the use of seasonings (such as ginger and coriander leaves to mask fishy tastes), or the blending of ingredients to for new flavors (as in sukiyaki or satay). Indeed, it may result from a combination of any of these elements. Also, note that in the case of an Asian meal, several dishes are served at the same time and are shared by everyone present. The wine chosen for such a meal has to be versatile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Guy, P |author2=Soon, E |title=Wine With Asian Food |page=1 |publisher=Tide-Mark Press| year=2008 |isbn=1-59490-114-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World AIDS Museum and Educational Center''', located at 1201 NE 26th St. in [[Wilton Manors, Florida]], opened on May 15, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Forman, "World AIDS Museum opens in Fort Lauderdale", ''Windy City Times'', 08-26-2014,

The AIDS Museum and Educational Center began as a HIV support group, Pozitive Attitudes ([https://pozitiveattitudes.com/]), at the [[Pride Center]] in Fort Lauderdale. The facilitator of that group was Steve Stagon and it was his idea to create an AIDS museum, in south Florida because [[Broward County]] and [[Miami-Dade County]] are "the epicenter of the AIDS crisis in America."&lt;ref&gt;World AIDS Museum, "About Us", http://www.worldaidsmuseum.org/about-us/.&lt;/ref&gt; A non-profit corporation was set up and fundraising began. After various local exhibits in churches and the Pride Center, once they had enough funding they choose the location on 26th Street.

On Nov 07, 2013,  [[Magic Johnson]] visited the World AIDS Museum and dedicated the space, 22 years to the  day he announced his HIV status.  Doors officially opened to the public in May  2014.  The World AIDS Museum and Educational Center has a main gallery featuring the historical timeline of the AIDS epidemic, 2 art galleries, and a research library. They also  do traveling exhibits and  educational programs in the schools.  The  current  CEO is Hugh Beswick and the Operations Manager is Ed Sparan.

Author and AIDS activist [[Larry Kramer]], who spoke there on March 9, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldaidsmuseum.org/, retrieved April 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What an amazing and outstanding place this is! ...Now they have funding from the state, and can...host groups of students. The exhibition, beautifly installed, has, among much else a GMHC [ [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] ] room, an [[ACT UP]] room, and a [[Keith Haring]] room. The history of hiv/AIDS timeline is extensive, I learned a few thngs myself (and was able to point out a few things that needed correction). The [[docent]] is exceptionally knowledgeable.... The board members are exceptionally committed.... They take pride in claiming that [[Fort Lauderdale]] is now the largest gay community in the country. This museum certainly beats anything in San Francisco or New York. Spread the word that this place exists!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldaidsmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Larry-Kramer-facebook-post.jpg], retrieved April 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Failed AIDS Museum project in Newark, New Jersey ==

In the background of he foundation of the World AIDS Museum is a failed project to create an AIDS Museum in [[Newark, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to About Us|url=http://www.aidsmuseum.org/about/index.html|work=aidsmuseum.org|accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in December 2004. Plans were developed in 2006 in connection with the 25th anniversary of the AIDS pandemic.&lt;ref name=lbar/&gt; One of the museum's goals was to showcase art by HIV-positive artists.&lt;ref name=gui&gt;{{cite news|title=Social Science Docket 32 Summer - Fall 2011 Guide to Museums in New Jersey|url=http://people.hofstra.edu/alan_j_singer/docket/docket/11.2.12_Guide_to_Museums_in_New_Jersey.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-22|newspaper=Social Science Docket|date=Summer–Fall 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the museum's (traveling) exhibits have been: 
*an exhibit of art by HIV-positive artists titled "Eyes of Mercy", was held from November 11 through December 1, 2006 at [[Seton Hall University]] in South Orange, NJ.  
*The museum also co-organized an exhibit titled "Edge of Light: Art in the Age of AIDS" at the Paul Robeson Center Gallery at Rutgers Newark, which ran from July 2007 until December 2007.  
*the World Culture Open Gallery (New York) was the site of a collaborative project called "Positive Still: Artists Respond to AIDS" featuring, among other artwork, five pieces from the AIDS Museum's permanent collection.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The Museum never had any paid staff or a home. Its Web site lists no activities since 2011, although it still (2017) has an active phone number and the Web site.

There is an AIDS Museum in [[Thailand]] and another being developed in [[South Africa]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5237">'''Y chromosome microdeletion''' ''(YCM)'' is a family of [[genetic disorder]]s caused by missing gene(s) in the [[Y chromosome]]. Many men with YCM exhibit no symptoms and lead normal lives.  However, YCM is also known to be present in a significant number of men with reduced [[fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Foresta, et al.: [http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/22/2/226 Y chromosome microdeletions and alterations of spermatogenesis]. Endocrine Reviews 22 (2): 226-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Men with reduced sperm production (in up to 20% of men with reduced [[sperm count]], some form of YCM has been detected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/15/7/1431|  journal=Human Reproduction| volume=15| issue= 7| pages= 1431–1434|date=July 2000| title=Prognostic value of Y deletion analysis| first=Csilla| last=Krausz |author2=Lluis Quintana-Murci |author3=Ken McElreavey| doi=10.1093/humrep/15.7.1431| pmid=10875846}}&lt;/ref&gt;) varies from [[oligozoospermia]], significant lack of sperm, or [[azoospermia]], complete lack of sperm.

==Cause==
The mechanism of [[mutation]] is not different for Y-chromosome microdeletion. However, the ability to repair it differs from other chromosomes. The human Y chromosome is passed directly from father to son, and is not protected against accumulating copying errors, whereas other chromosomes are error corrected by recombining genetic information from mother and father. This may leave [[natural selection]] as the primary repair mechanism for the Y chromosome.

==Diagnosis==
Y chromosome microdeletion is currently diagnosed by extracting DNA from [[leukocytes]] in a man's blood sample, mixing it with some of the about 300 known [[genetic marker]]s for [[sequence-tagged site]]s (STS) on the Y chromosome, and then using [[polymerase chain reaction]] amplification and [[gel electrophoresis]] in order to test whether the DNA sequence corresponding to the selected markers is present in the DNA.

Such procedures can test only the integrity of a tiny part of the overall 23 million [[base pair]] long Y chromosome, therefore the sensitivity of such tests depends on the choice and number of markers used. Present diagnostic techniques can only discover certain types of deletions and mutations on a chromosome and give therefore no complete picture of genetic causes of infertility. They can only demonstrate the presence of some defects, but not the absence of any possible genetic defect on the chromosome.

The gold standard test for genetic mutation, namely complete [[DNA sequencing]] of a patient's Y chromosome, is still far too expensive for use in epidemiologic research or even clinical diagnostics.

==Infertility==
Microdeletions in the Y chromosome have been found at a much higher rate in [[infertile]] men than in fertile controls&lt;ref name="pmid16157049"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Song NH, Wu HF, Zhang W, etal |title=Screening for Y chromosome microdeletions in idiopathic and nonidiopathic infertile men with varicocele and cryptorchidism |journal=Chin. Med. J. |volume=118 |issue=17 |pages=1462–7 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16157049 |doi= |url=http://www.cmj.org/Periodical/LinkIn.asp?journal=Chinese%20Medical%20Journal&amp;linkintype=pubmed&amp;year=2005&amp;vol=118&amp;issue=17&amp;beginpage=1462}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the correlation found may still go up as improved genetic testing techniques for the Y chromosome are developed.

Much study has been focused upon the "[[azoospermia factor locus]]" (AZF), at Yq11.&lt;ref name="pmid19421675"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poongothai J, Gopenath TS, Manonayaki S |title=Genetics of human male infertility |journal=Singapore Med J |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=336–47 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19421675 |doi= |url=http://smj.sma.org.sg/5004/5004ra1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific partial deletion of AZFc called ''gr/gr deletion'' is significantly associated with [[male infertility]] among Caucasians in Europe and the Western Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq046 | title = What about gr/gr deletions and male infertility? Systematic review and meta-analysis | year = 2010 | last1 = Stouffs | first1 = K. | last2 = Lissens | first2 = W. | last3 = Tournaye | first3 = H. | last4 = Haentjens | first4 = P. | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–209 | pmid = 20959348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional genes associated with [[spermatogenesis]] in men and reduced fertility upon Y chromosome deletions include [[RBM (gene)|RBM]], [[DAZ (gene)|DAZ]], [[SPGY]], and [[TSPY]].&lt;ref name=Goncalves&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Acta Med Port|date=April 1998| volume=11| issue=4| pages=365–72| title=Y chromosome and male infertility| language=Portuguese| last=Goncalves| first= J|author2=Lavinha J. | pmid=9644848}}&lt;/ref&gt;
