      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9647">Between 2011 and 2014, the [[United States]] [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF), part of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], engaged in a '''campaign of fabricated [[sting operation]]s''' in which individuals were [[solicitation|enticed]] to participate in [[gun crime|gun]] and [[drug crime|drug]] related crimes against entirely fictitious [[stash house]] targets for which they were then arrested and convicted.&lt;ref name="usatoday2013"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/27/atf-stash-houses-sting-usa-today-investigation/2457109/ ATF uses fake drugs, big bucks to snare suspects] - USA Today, 2013-06-28&lt;/ref&gt; The "made up" crimes were in fact entirely the creation of ATF, and as described by two [[federal judge]]s, carried severe sentences (typically 15 years)&lt;ref name="hudsonruling" /&gt; but were likely to cause grave unfairness and [[miscarriage of justice]].&lt;ref name="castillo2013"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/01/atf-stash-house-robbery-discrimination/2608657/ Judge: ATF stings may be targeting minorities] - USA Today, 3013-08-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wright2014"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/18/judge-slams-atf-stash-house-stings/6565179/ Federal judge blasts ATF stings] - USA Today 2014-03-18&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[USA Today]]'' investigation in 2013 showed that over 1000 individuals have been [[incarceration|incarcerated]] for lengthy periods since 2011 for such "fake" crimes, and that the strategy has become a "key part" of the Bureau's strategy.&lt;ref name="usatoday2013" /&gt; ATF officials stated that the strategy [[Precrime|pre-emptively]] targeted [[precrime|people likely to commit serious crime]] rather than waiting for them to do so;&lt;ref name="usatoday2013" /&gt; opponents and critics, and later, judges, expressed concerns that it was tantamount to [[entrapment]] and [[thought crime|punishing people for thoughts and possibilities]] rather than actual criminal acts, by presenting them with deliberately hard to resist fabricated inducements and goading them to become a participant, or to engage in more extreme criminal activities, up to an extent chosen almost completely by ATF.&lt;ref name="castillo2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wright2014" /&gt;

In 2013 [[Illinois]] Chief Federal Judge [[Ruben Castillo (judge)|Ruben Castillo]] expressed significant concerns over one such case (''Brown et al'').&lt;ref name="castillo2013" /&gt; In 2014 California judge [[Otis D. Wright II|Otis Wright]] went further and dismissed another such case (''Hudson'') as "outrageous" government conduct and "[[unconstitutional]]", stating that it had neither prevented nor detected crime, but cost the taxpayer dearly, and that the overwhelming extent of ATF direction of the purported crime, and the level of ATF involvement, made the ATF operative more of a participant rather than an observer, the sentence a reflection of ATF whim rather than defendant's own conduct, and the case into one that lacked [[due process]].&lt;ref name="hudsonruling"&gt;[https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1093640/031118524877.pdf ''U.S.A. vs. Hudson, Whitfield and Dunlap'' ruling, case 2:13-cr-00126-ODW-3, dated 2014-03-10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wright2014" /&gt;

== ''U.S. v. Hudson, Whitfield &amp; Dunlap'' (decided 2014) ==
The case was one of many&lt;ref name="hudsonanalysis" /&gt; US Government cases where a situation was presented to members of the public, who were tempted into committing a crime related to drugs, theft, or firearms, on the basis of a fabricated situation "[[sting operation]]".&lt;ref name="hudsonanalysis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140319/07345226624/judge-otis-wright-slams-made-up-government-plot-designed-to-ensnare-gullible-non-criminals.shtml|title=Judge Otis Wright Slams 'Made Up' Government 'Plot' Designed To Ensnare Gullible Poor People|work=Techdirt.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/18/judge-slams-atf-stash-house-stings/6565179/|title=Federal judge blasts ATF stings}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the judge [[Otis D. Wright II]] dismissed citing "outrageous" behavior.  He found that by fabricating every aspect of the supposed circumstances in a manner calculated to entice the subjects' involvement, the government acted "repugnant[ly] to the Constitution" by creating a crime "cut from whole cloth" that was intended not to fail to entice involvement, and was not related to any actual or existent criminal enterprise, but was calculated to produce a sentence of around 15 years:&lt;ref name="hudsonruling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hudsonanalysis" /&gt;

:{| style="font-size:85%"
|-
| "[C]ontrary to the Government’s contention, Dunlap’s “admissions” only served to demonstrate that he had no propensity to commit drug crimes—the entire subject of the reverse sting ... Allowing after-the-fact knowledge to mitigate the Court’s concerns in a situation like this also creates a [[perverse incentive]] for the Government. It encourages the Government to cast a wide net, trawling for crooks in seedy, poverty-ridden areas—all without an iota of suspicion that any particular person has committed similar conduct in the past. And if the Government happens to get it right and catch someone who previously engaged in crime, the courts will place their imprimatur on the whole [[fishing expedition]] ... The undercover agent invented [almost everything]... Dunlap brought little to the table besides his sheer presence and perhaps the hope of being able to obtain some quick cash.... the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] manufactured this entire crime. It did not infiltrate an ongoing [[criminal enterprise]]."

"The [[undercover agent]]’s continued participation, assurances, and suggestions... made him "a partner in the criminal activity" rather than a mere "observer"... but for Thompson’s imagination, there would have been no fictitious stash-house robbery to begin with— let alone the need for guns and extra associates... Everything about the scheme—and therefore almost everything bearing upon a defendant’s ultimate [[criminal sentence|sentence]]—hinges solely on the Government’s whim... Why were the guards allegedly armed—necessitating that Defendants bring weapons along with them? All of these factors came down to the ATF and the undercover agent alone. That sort of arbitrariness offends the Constitution’s [[due process|due-process]] demands... [S]ince the Government created each necessity and justification, the sentence no longer bears a proportional relationship to the defendant’s culpability—just the Government’s imagination. Something more than mere [[bootstrapping]] is needed for the Government to take 15-plus years away from Dunlap’s life."

"[T]he problem with creating crime [is that]: the Government is not making the country any safer or reducing the actual flow of drugs. But for the Government’s action, the fake stash house would still be fake, the nonexistent drugs would still be nonexistent, and the fictional armed guards would still be fictional... These fake robberies... cost federal taxpayers approximately $433,401 per defendant in [[incarceration]] costs alone."

"The time has come to remind the [[Executive Branch]] that the [[US Constitution|Constitution]] charges it with law enforcement—not crime creation. A reverse-sting operation like this one transcends the bounds of due process and makes the Government “the oppressor of its people.” .... [T]he Constitution will not tolerate subjecting an individual to prosecution for an imaginary crime [carrying] a punishment which rests entirely on ATF agents’ whims."

* In ''[[Jacobson v. United States]]'' ({{ussc|503|540|1990}}) the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] considered an entrapment case from outside drug enforcement, and overturned the conviction of a [[Nebraska]] man for ordering [[child pornography]] after two years of being cajoled by material created by postal inspectors. Held: the government must show that predisposition existed before the government became involved, and ''prior behavior when activity was legal'' does not constitute ''evidence of predisposition to break the law'' if the conduct is subsequently made illegal. (Contrast ''[[Hampton v. United States]]'', where predisposition did exist, even though the drugs and drug related activity of the defendant in that case wholly coincided with the encouragement of law enforcement agents.)

'''Aequiprobabilism''', also spelled '''Æquiprobabilism''', is one of several doctrines in moral theology opposed to [[probabilism]].

==Teaching==

#If the opinions for and against the cessation of a law that existed at one point having equal or nearly equal probabilities then it is not permissible to act on the less safe opinion. 
#If the safe opinion being certainly more probable than the less unsafe opinion then it is unlawful to follow the less safe opinion.

With the first of these propositions Probabilists agree—but they deny the truth of the second and third propositions (cf. Marc, "Institutiones Morales", I, nn. 91-103). 
Arguments for Æquiprobabilism: 
#  
# In proof of their second proposition, Æquiprobabilists quote the same axiom: in pari delicto melior est conditio possidentis. When the doubt concerns the cessation of a law, the law is in possession, and therefore the law must be observed until it is displaced by a stronger probability in favour of liberty. Probabilists reply to this argument that liberty is always in possession, since law and obligation presuppose liberty in the subject. 
# In proof of the third proposition Æquiprobabilists put forward various arguments, of which the following are the most forcible: 
## A person is bound to endeavour to bring his actions into harmony with objective morality. But a person who follows the less probable opinion in favour of liberty fails to observe this dictate of prudence, and consequently acts unlawfully (cf. Wouters "De Minusprobabilismo", p.&amp;nbsp;71). Probabilists reply that this argument would end in [[Rigorism]] if carried to its logical conclusion.  Because the only way efficiently to bring our actions into perfect harmony with objective morality is to follow the safe opinion so long as the less safe opinion has not acquired moral certainty. This is the only way of preventing all serious danger of committing material sin and consequently is the only way of observing perfect harmony with objective morality. However, since Rigorism is universally condemned, the argument must be rejected, and the principles of Probabilism must be adopted which hold that it is sufficient to observe harmony with objective morality insofar as this is known with moral certainty (cf. Lehmkuhl, "Theologia Moralis", I, n. 191). 
## On 26 June 1680 the [[Holy Office]], under the presidency of [[Innocent XI]], issued, in connection with the teaching of [[Thyrsus Gonzalez]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], a Decree of which the authentic text was published 19 April 1902, by the Secretary of the Holy Office. So much controversy has recently arisen in regard to the value of decree, that it is advantageous to quote the whole text: "A report having been made by Father Laurea of the contents of a letter directed by Father Thyrsus Gonzalez, S.J., to Our Most Holy Lord; the Most Eminent Lords said that the Secretary of State must write to the [[Apostolic Nuncio]] of the Spains [directing him] to signify to the said Father Thyrsus that His Holiness, having received his letter favourably, and having read it with approval, has commanded that he [Thyrsus] shall freely and fearlessly preach, teach, and defend with his pen the more probable opinion, and also manfully attack the opinion of those who assert that in a conflict of a less probable opinion with a more probable, known and estimated as such, it is allowed to follow the less probable; and to inform him that whatever he does and writes on behalf of the more probable opinion will be pleasing to His Holiness. - Let it be enjoined upon the [[Father General]] of the Society of Jesus, as by order [de ordine] of His Holiness, not only to permit the Fathers of the Society to write in favour of the more probable opinion and to attack the opinion of those who assert that in a conflict of a less probable opinion with a more probable, known and estimated as such, it is allowed to follow the less probable- but also to write to all the Universities of the Society [informing them] that it is the mind of His Holiness that whosoever chooses may freely write in favour of the more probable opinion, and may attack the aforesaid contrary [opinion]; and to order them to submit entirely to the command of His Holiness." 
Æquiprobabilists say that in this Decree there is a clear expression of the mind of Innocent XI about the morality of teaching that it is permissible to act on the less safe opinion when the safe opinion is certainly more probable. The pope disapproves of this teaching, commends Father Gonzalez for his opposition to it, and orders the General of the Jesuits to allow full liberty so that anyone who pleases may write against it. 
Probabilists reply that, though Innocent XI was opposed to Probabilism, his official Decree merely commanded that liberty of teaching be allowed to the members of the order. Moreover, they point out that Gonzalez was not an Æquiprobabilist, but a Probabiliorist of a strict type whom St. Alphonsus Liguori regarded as an extremist.

'''Alternative liability''' is a [[legal doctrine]] that allows a plaintiff to shift the burden of proving causation of her injury to multiple defendants, even though only one of them could have been responsible. The typical case showing the principle of alternative liability in action is [[Summers v. Tice]], where the two defendants negligently shot in the direction of the plaintiff and only one of the bullets caused the plaintiff's injury. In the interest of justice, the innocent plaintiff's case is not defeated because she cannot prove which party was the [[actual cause]] (but-for cause) of her injury.

==Requirements==
The doctrine requires that the plaintiff bring all possible defendants into court and that the plaintiff show the defendants all breached a duty of reasonable care. The burden then shifts to the defendants to provide evidence of who caused the injury.

==Rationale==
The underpinning of this doctrine is that a plaintiff should not be barred from seeking recovery simply because she does not know who caused her injury. The defendants are usually the parties in the best position to have the relevant information.

Distinguish alternative liability from the smoke-out function of [[res ipsa loquitur]] seen in the leading case of [[Ybarra v. Spangard]]. In ''Ybarra'', the plaintiff brought all defendants who could have ''possibly'' been negligent (breached a duty of reasonable care) so that they could show which party actually was negligent. Thus, in the smoke-out function of [[res ipsa]], the burden is shifted on the defendants to show ''negligence'', whereas in alternative liability all defendants are all shown to have breached a duty of reasonable care and the plaintiff shifts the burden to show ''causation''.

'''Andrew Brook''' (born March 17, 1943) is a Canadian philosopher, author and academic particularly known for his writings on [[Immanuel Kant]] and the interplay between philosophy and [[cognitive science]]. Brook is Chancellor's Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at [[Carleton University]], President of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association#Constituent organizations|Canadian Psychoanalytic Society]], and former President of the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]].

== Biography ==

Brook was born in [[Edmonton]], Alberta and   received  a BA in 1965 and a MA in 1966 from the [[University of Alberta]]. He then attended [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]],&lt;ref&gt;The Rhodes Trust.

== Writings ==

=== ''Kant and the Mind'' ===

''Kant and the Mind'' was first published in 1994 by Cambridge University Press: in 1996 a paperback edition appeared. As Brook notes in the preface, Kant and the Mind was written for two audiences. First, cognitive scientists, philosophers of mind, and students of cognition. Second, Kant scholars. The book thus has two parts: the first four chapters provide an overview of Kant's model of the mind for general audiences. The second part, written primarily for Kant scholars, attempts to justify the reading given in the first four chapters.   Brook emphasizes in the book   that Kant had something to offer contemporary psychology, cognitive science and philosophy of mind. he  writes, "I think that the discoveries he made about the mind not only were a contribution in their time, but continue to be important now."&lt;ref&gt;Brook, A. (1994). ''Kant and the Mind'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
Brook attributes the following discoveries to Kant: 1) the mind has the ability to synthesize a single coherent representation of self and the world. 2) The mind has a unity that is necessary to produce representation. 3) The mind's awareness of itself has unique features stemming from the semantic apparatus that it uses to achieve this awareness. He also suggests that three of Kant's insights have been adopted by cognitive science: the transcendental method (inference to the best explanation), that experience requires both concepts and percepts; and his general picture of the mind as a system of concept-using functions for manipulating representations.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, A. (1994). ''Kant and the Mind'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;   He explains that Kant distrusted introspection as a means of revealing the structure of the mind, yet also had deep reservations about Cartesian ''a priori'' arguments. The theory of mind that Brook finds in Kant is not based on either approach, but instead explores what powers the mind must have in order to have experiences and representations that it has.&lt;ref name = Stevenson /&gt;

Brook distinguishes four kinds of awareness, two of which are also kinds of self-awareness: simple awareness (awareness of an object without being aware of being aware), awareness with recognition, awareness of one's representational states and awareness of oneself as the subject of one's representational states.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, M. Review of ''Kant and the Mind'' in  ''The Review of Metaphysics'', 49 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; He divides the latter into empirical self-awareness (being aware of one's own mental states) and apperceptive self-awareness (ASA) (being aware of oneself as the subject of those states).&lt;ref name = Stevenson&gt;Stevenson, L. Review of  ''Kant and the Mind.'' ''The Philosophical Quarterly,'' 45, 351-354.&lt;/ref&gt; ASA is not awareness of oneself as an object with properties; rather, ASA is a bald reference to oneself as existing as oneself. One need not ascribe to oneself any properties whatsoever. If Brook's reading of Kant is correct, then Kant discovered ASA 200 years before contemporary theories.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, R. Review of ''Kant and the Mind''. ''Mind, 105,'' 491-495 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these distinctions, Brook writes  that Kant thought the mind is not merely the subject that has representations, but is itself a representation. ("The mind, the self, the understanding, the thing that thinks not only has representations; it is a representation.")&lt;ref name = "Brook233"&gt;Brook, A. (1994). ''Kant and the Mind'', p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;
Not only is the mind a representation under this reading, but it is what Brook calls a global representation (the result of synthesis of a multitude of representations into a single intentional object).&lt;ref name = "Brook233" /&gt; Brook argues that treating the mind as a global representation removes any risk of an [[Homunculus argument|homunculus problem]] (Hogan, 1996), and further argues that this global representation is the representational base for ASA.

Reviewing the book, Stevenson wrote in ''[[The Philosophical Quarterly]]'', "I venture the judgement that this will be recognized as one of the most important books ever on Kant &lt;ref name =Stevenson /&gt;  However, Eric Watkins in the ''[[Journal of the History of Philosophy]]'' raised concerns about the literature Brook cited and the more controversial interpretations: "it should be noted, however, that Brook neglects almost entirely the relevant German scholarship on Kant's theory of mind, in the form of work by G. Prauss, W. Carl, M. Frank, G. Mohr, B. Thole and D. Sturma" (Watkins, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;3).&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, E. Kant and the Mind. Journal of the History of Philosophy, 33, 524-525.&lt;/ref&gt; Watkins further criticize Brook's claims that one can be aware of the mind as it is and that the mind is a global representation, since the latter directly conflicts with Kant's view that the [[noumenal]] self is immaterial, not a representation.&lt;ref&gt;Other reviewa:   Kitcher, P. '' Kant and the Mind.'' in '' The Philosophical Review,'' 104, 590-592; Wilson, F. ''Kant and the Mind.'' in ''Journal of History of the Behavioral Sciences,'' 31, 175-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Knowledge and Mind'' ===

''Knowledge and Mind'' is an introductory text   treating both [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of mind]] l. Robert Stainton and Brook co-authored the book which was published in 2000. Divided into three parts, the first part discusses scepticism, knowledge of the external world and knowledge of language. The second part focuses on the metaphysics of mind, as well as free-will. The third discusses knowledge of mind, naturalism and how epistemology and philosophy of mind should resonate in cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;Reviews: Staudacher, Alexander (2003).

'''''Barddas''''' is a book of material compiled and written by the Welsh writer and [[literary forger]] [[Iolo Morganwg]]. Though purported to be an authentic compilation of ancient Welsh [[bard]]ic and [[druid]]ic theology and lore, its contents are largely Iolo's own invention. The work was published by [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)|John Williams]] for the [[Welsh Manuscripts Society]] in two volumes, 1862 and 1874.&lt;ref name="Löffler2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marion Löffler|title=The literary and historical legacy of Iolo Morganwg, 1826-1926|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIBnAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=2007|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=978-0-7083-2113-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baynes1833"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Spencer Baynes|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKgMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA319|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=1833|publisher=C.

==Publication==
Following [[Iolo Morganwg]]'s death in 1826, his son [[Taliesin Williams]] set about collecting and publishing his unpublished manuscripts. This resulted in three volumes, including ''The Iolo Papers'' in 1848, published a year after Taliesin Williams' unexpected death. Subsequently, Iolo's papers were purchased by [[Benjamin Hall, 1st Baron Llanover|Benjamin]] and [[Augusta Hall, Baroness Llanover|Augusta Hall]], who made them accessible to other scholars. [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)|John Williams]], alias "Ab Ithel", was among the first to take up the offer; he edited the two volumes now known as ''Barddas'' for the [[Welsh Manuscripts Society]], which appeared in 1862 and 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, pp. xv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Williams claimed the ''Barddas'' material was based on authentic ancient manuscripts originally compiled by the 16th-century antiquarian [[Llywelyn Siôn]]. In reality, almost all of it was either Iolo's own work, or heavily edited by him. Volume I is divided into three sections. The first section, "Symbols", chiefly discusses "[[coelbren (alphabet)|coelbren]]", a supposed Bardic [[alphabet]] devised by Iolo. The second section, "Theology", is the most significant. It discusses Iolo's elaborate philosophy and cosmology, which he claimed was the actual belief system of the ancient bards, though it is really a variegation of Iolo's own unconventional Christian beliefs and interpretation of Welsh tradition.&lt;ref name=Matthewsxvi&gt;Matthews, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.maryjones.us/jce/barddas.html |title= Jones |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section includes a "[[catechism]]" in the form of a question and answer session regarding the cycle of [[re-incarnation]]. It discusses the "circles of being" from [[Annwn]] (lowest state, [[Hades]] or Fairyland) through circles of Abred (probation state), Gwynfyd (perfect [[liberty]]) and Ceugant (infinity).&lt;ref name="Rolleston2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

Volume II was left unfinished at Williams' death; it is largely a guidebook for bards and [[gorsedd]]s.&lt;ref name=Matthewsxvi/&gt;

{{Anthropology of religion|Basic|image=[[File:Roman fresco Villa dei Misteri Pompeii 001.jpg|260px]]|caption=Initiation at the Villa of Mysteries, Pompeii, a rite of passage expressing communitas}}
'''''Communitas''''' is a [[Latin]] [[noun]] commonly referring either to an unstructured [[community]] in which [[person|people]] are equal, or to the very spirit of community. It also has special significance as a [[loanword]] in [[cultural anthropology]] and the [[social sciences]]. Victor Turner, who defined the anthropological usage of communitas, was interested in the interplay between what he called social 'structure' and 'antistructure'; ''Liminality'' and ''Communitas'' are both components of antistructure.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, V. (1974). Dramas, Fields, and Metaphors: Symbolic Action in Human Society. Cornell University Press. pp. 273-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communitas refers to an unstructured state in which all members of a community are equal allowing them to share a common experience, usually through a rite of passage. Communitas is characteristic of people experiencing [[liminality]] together. This term is used to distinguish the modality of social [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] from an area of common living. There is more than one distinction between [[structure]] and communitas. The most familiar is the difference of [[secular]] and [[sacred]]. Every social position has something sacred about it. This sacred component is acquired during [[rite of passage|rites of passages]], through the changing of positions. Part of this sacredness is achieved through the transient humility learned in these phases, this allows people to reach a higher position.

==Victor and Edith Turner==
Communitas is an acute point of community. It takes community to the next level and allows the whole of the community to share a common experience, usually through a rite of passage. This brings everyone onto an equal level: even if you are higher in position, you have been lower and you know what that is.

Turner (1969, Pg.132; see also &lt;ref&gt;Olaveson, T. (2001). Collective Effervescence and Communitas: Processual Models of Ritual and Society in Emile Durkheim and Victor Turner. Dialectical Anthropology, 26, pp. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;) distinguishes between:
* ''existential or spontaneous communitas'', the transient personal experience of togetherness; e.g. that which occurs during a counter-culture happening.
* ''normative communitas'', which occurs as communitas is transformed from its existential state to being organized into a permanent social system due to the need for social control.
* ''ideological communitas'', which can be applied to many utopian social models.

Communitas as a concept used by [[Victor Turner]] in his study of [[ritual]] has been criticized by anthropologists. See [[John Eade]] &amp; [[Michael J. Sallnow]]'s ''[[Contesting the Sacred]]'' (1991)

Edith Turner, Victor's widow and anthropologist in her own right, published in 2011&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Edith. 2012. ''Communitas: The Anthropology of Collective Joy''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; a definitive overview of the anthropology of communitas, outlining the concept in relation to the natural history of joy, including the nature of human experience and its narration, festivals, music and sports, work, disaster, the sacred, revolution and nonviolence, nature and spirit, and ritual and rites of passage.

==Paul and Percival Goodman==
{{main article|Communitas (book)}}
''[[Communitas (book)|Communitas]]'' is also the title of a book published in 1947 by the 20th-century American thinker and writer [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] and his brother, [[Percival Goodman]]. Their book examines three kinds of possible societies: a society centered on consumption, a society centered on artistic and creative pursuits, and a society which maximizes human liberty. The Goodmans emphasize freedom from both coercion by a government or church and from human necessities by providing these free of cost to all citizens who do a couple of years of conscripted labor as young adults.

==Roberto Esposito==
In 1998, Italian philosopher [[Roberto Esposito]] published a book under the name ''Communitas'' challenging the traditional understanding of this concept. It was translated in English in 2010 by Timothy Campbell. In this book, Esposito offers a very different interpretation of the concept of ''communitas'' based on a thorough etymological analysis of the word: "Community isn't a property, nor is it a territory to be separated and defended against those who do not belong to it. Rather, it is a void, a debt, a gift to the other that also reminds us of our constitutive alterity with respect to ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=4107 Stanford University Press] : ''Communitas. The Origin and Destiny of Community'' by Roberto Esposito, translated by Timothy C. Campbell&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on with his "deconstruction" of the concept of ''communitas'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"From here it emerges that ''communitas'' is the totality of persons united not by a "property" but precisely by an obligation or a debt; not by an "addition" but by a "subtraction": by a lack, a limit that is configured as an onus, or even as a defective modality for him who is "affected", unlike for him who is instead "exempt" or "exempted". Here we find the final and most characteristic of the oppositions associated with (or that dominate) the alternative between public and private, those in other words that contrast ''communitas'' to ''immunitas''. If ''communis'' is he who is required to carry out the functions of an office ― or to the donation of a grace ― on the contrary, he is called immune who has to perform no office, and for that reason he remains ungrateful. He can completely preserve his own position through a ''vacatio muneris''. Whereas the ''communitas'' is bound by the sacrifice of the ''compensatio'', the ''immunitas'' implies the beneficiary of the ''dispensatio''."&lt;ref&gt;ESPOSITO, Roberto ([1998]2010). ''Communitas. The Origin and Destiny of Community'', tr. by Timothy Campbell, Stanford: Stanford University Press, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Therefore the community cannot be thought of as a body, as a corporation in which individuals are founded in a larger individual. Neither is community to be interpreted as a mutual, intersubjective "recognition" in which individuals are reflected in each other so as to confirm their initial identity; as a collective bond that comes at a certain point to connect individuals that before were separate. The community isn't a mode of being, much less a "making" of the individual subject. It isn't the subject's expansion or multiplication but its exposure to what interrupts the closing and turns it inside out: a dizziness, a syncope, a spasm in the continuity of the subject."&lt;ref&gt;ESPOSITO, Roberto ([1998]2010). ''Communitas. The Origin and Destiny of Community'', tr. by Timothy Campbell, Stanford: Stanford University Press, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Dimitrie''' or '''Demetrius{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} Cantemir''' ({{IPA-ro|diˈmitri.e kanteˈmir|-|Ro-Dimitrie Cantemir.ogg}}; 1673–1723),&lt;!--full dates in infobox per MOS--&gt; also known by [[#Name|other spellings]], was a [[Moldavia]]n soldier, statesman, and man of letters. He was twice [[voivode of Moldavia|voivode]] of [[Principality of Moldavia|Moldavia]] (March–April 1693 and 1710–1711). During his second term, he allied his state with [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in their war against Moldavia's [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] overlords; Russia's defeat forced [[Cantemir dynasty|Cantemir's family]] into exile and the replacement of the native voivodes by the [[Greek people|Greek]] [[phanariotes|phanariots]]. Cantemir was also a prolific writer, variously a [[philosopher]], [[historian]], [[composer]], [[musicologist]], [[linguistics|linguist]], [[ethnographer]], and [[geographer]]. His son [[Antiochus Kantemir|Antioch]], Russia's ambassador to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]] and a friend of [[Montesquieu]] and [[Voltaire]], would go on to be known as "the father of [[Russian poetry]]".

==Name==
Dimitrie is the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] form of the name [[latinisation of names|Latinized]] as Demetrius and, less often, [[anglicization|anglicized]] as '''Demeter'''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} The [[Russian language|Russian]] form of his name was {{nowrap|'''Dmitri Konstantinovich Kantemir'''}} ({{lang|ru|Дми́трий Константи́нович Кантеми́р}}). He is also known as ''Dimitri Kantemiroğlu'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] contexts, ''Dymitr Kantemir'' in [[Polish language|Polish]], and ''Dēmētrios Kantimērēs'' ({{lang|grc|Δημήτριος Καντιμήρης}}) in [[Greek language|Greek]].

{{anchor|History|Biography}}

==Life==
Dimitrie was born in [[Silişteni]], [[Principality of Moldavia|Moldavia]] (now [[Vaslui County]], [[Romania]]){{citation needed|date=June 2016}} on 26 October 1673{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} to [[Constantin Cantemir]] and Ana Bantăș.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} His elderly father was from a [[boyar|noble]] family of [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean]] [[Tatars|Tatar]] extraction, which came to Moldavia in the mid-17th century.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} One of the explanations for the name "Cantemir" is that it's derived from "Can Temur", meaning "the blood of [[Timur]]", marking a direct descent from the conqueror [[Tamerlane]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Ware Nelson, ''The Life and the Writings of Dimitrie Cantemir (1673-1723), Prince of Moldavia'', Stanford University (1955), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a learned daughter of a local noble family.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In 1685, Constantin was named voivode of Moldavia by its Turkish overlords.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

Although Constantin himself was illiterate, he educated his sons Dimitrie and [[Antioh Cantemir|Antioh]] thoroughly. Dimitrie learned [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] to read the [[classics]] as a child. One of his tutors was the scholar [[John Komnenos Molyvdos]]. Between 1687 and 1710, Dimitrie spent most of his time as a hostage or envoy in [[Constantinople]], living in [[Cantemir Palace in Istanbul|the palace]] he owned, where he learned [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and studied [[History of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman history]] at the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarchate]]'s [[Phanar Greek Orthodox College|Greek Academy]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} While there, he also [[musical composition|composed]] [[Turkish music]].{{sfnp|Popescu-Judetz|1999}}

Upon Constantin's death in 1693, Dimitrie briefly succeeded him to the voivodeship but was passed over within three weeks in favor of [[Constantin Duca]], whose candidacy was supported by his father-in-law, the [[Principality of Wallachia|Wallachian]] [[voivode of Wallachia|voivode]] [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]].{{sfnp|Lemny|2009|p=51}} When his brother Antioh eventually succeeded to the control of Moldavia, Dimitrie served as his envoy to the Porte.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} During these years, he also served with distinction in the Turkish army on its campaigns.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}

In 1710, Dimitrie was appointed voivode in his own right. Believing Ottoman Turkey to be collapsing,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} he placed Moldavia under [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n control through a secret agreement signed at [[Lutsk]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He then joined [[Peter the Great]] in [[Pruth Campaign|his war against the Turks]]. This ended in failure at [[Stănilești]] (18–22 July 1711) and the [[Cantemir dynasty|Cantemirs]] were forced into Russian exile.{{sfnp|Stoica|1919|p=19}} Turkey then replaced the voivodeship with the rule of [[Greeks|Greek]] [[phanariotes|phanariots]].

In Russia, Dimitrie was created both a Russian prince (''[[knyaz]]'') by [[Peter the Great|Peter]] and a [[Reichsfürst|prince]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles&amp;nbsp;VI]]. He lived on an estate at Dmitrovka near [[Oryol]],    with a sizable [[boyar]] retinue (including the chronicler [[Ion Neculce]]). There he died on 21 August 1723, on the very day he was awarded his German title. In 1935, his remains were returned to [[Iași]].

==Family==
Cantemir was married twice: to Princess '''Kassandra [[Cantacuzino family|Cantacuzene]]''' (1682–1713), daughter of Prince [[Șerban Cantacuzino]] and supposed descendant of the [[Kantakouzenos|Byzantine Kantakouzenoi]], in 1699, and to Princess '''Anastasia [[Trubetskoy|Trubetskaya]]''' (1700–1755) in 1717.

Cantemir's children were rather prominent in Russian history. His elder daughter [[Maria Cantemir]] (1700–1754) so attracted Peter the Great that he allegedly planned to divorce his wife [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine]] to be with her. Upon Catherine's own ascension to the throne, however, Maria was forced to enter a convent. Cantemir's son [[Antiochus Kantemir|Antioch]] (1708–1744) was the Russian ambassador at London and Paris, a friend of [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]], and so influential a poet, satirist, and essayist as to be considered "the father of [[Russian poetry]]". Another son '''Constantin''' (1703–1747) was implicated in the [[Golitsyn family|Golitsyn]] conspiracy against the empress [[Anna of Russia|Anna]] and was exiled to [[Siberia]]. Dimitrie's younger daughter '''Smaragda''' (1720–1761), reckoned one of the great beauties of her time, was the wife of Prince [[Dmitry Mikhailovich Golitsyn the Younger|Dmitriy Mikhailovich Golitsyn]] and a friend of the empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]].

==Works==
Cantemir was a polyglot known as one of the greatest linguists of his time, speaking and writing eleven languages. Well versed in Oriental scholarship, his ''oeuvre'' is voluminous, diverse, and original, although some of his scientific writings contain unconfirmed theories or simple inaccuracies. Between 1711 and 1719 he wrote his most important creations. In 1714, he was named a member of the [[Royal Academy of Berlin|Royal Academy]] of [[Berlin]].

Cantemir's best-known history work was his ''[[History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire]]'' {{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} (the original title was in [[Latin]], ''Historia incrementorum atque decrementorum Aulae Othomanicae''&lt;ref&gt;[https://ottomanhistorians.uchicago.edu/en/historian/dimitrie-cantemir Ottoman Historians]&lt;/ref&gt;). This volume circulated throughout [[Europe]] in [[manuscript]] for a number of years. It was finally printed in 1734 in [[London]] and was later translated and printed in Germany and France. It remained the seminal work on the [[Ottoman Empire]] up to the middle of the 19th century; notably, it was used as a reference for [[Edward Gibbon]]'s own ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. Later scholarship contests many points owing to the dubiousness of some of Cantemir's sources.

He also published the first critical history of [[Romania]] as a whole,{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} the ''Chronicle of the Antiquity of the Romano-Moldavo-Wallachians'' (''{{lang|ro|Hronicul vechimei a romano-moldo-vlahilor}}''), from 1719 to 1722. It asserted the [[Latin]] origin of the [[Romanian language]] and the Roman origin of the people living within the former land of [[Dacia]].&lt;ref&gt;Moldavian description prefaced by club Măciuca Constantine , Ed. Ion Creanga , Bucharest 1978.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantemir composed his ''Description of Moldavia'' ({{lang-la|Descriptio Moldaviae}})&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cantemir |first=Demetrius |title=[[:s:la:Descriptio Moldaviae|Descriptio Moldaviae]] |language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1714{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} at the request of the Royal Academy in Berlin. Covering geographical, ethnographical, and economic aspects of Moldavia, it was similarly circulated in manuscript and only published much later. It appeared in a German geographical magazine in 1769 and was published as a book in 1771. His {{circa|lk=no|1714}} manuscript map of Moldova was the first real map of the country, containing geographical detail as well as administrative information. Printed in 1737 in the [[United Provinces (Low Countries)|Netherlands]], it formed the basis of most European maps of the country for decades.

A few of Cantemir's roughly forty Ottoman compositions are still performed today as part of the Turkish repertoire but his greatest service was in preserving 350 traditional instrumental pieces by publishing them in a musical notation he developed from the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] in his work ''Edvar-i Musiki'', offered as a present to [[Ahmed III|Sultan Ahmed III]] in 1703 or 1704 and recently reprinted with modern explanations.&lt;ref&gt;''Kantemiroğlu, Kitâbu 'İlmi'l-Mûsiki alâ Vechi'l-Hurûfât, Mûsikiyi Harflerle Tesbit ve İcrâ İlminin Kitabı'', [[Yalçın Tura]], Yapı Kredi Yayınları, Istanbul 2001, {{ISBN|975-08-0167-9}}. {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[Bezmara]] ensemble recorded ''Yitik Sesin Peşinde'' ("In Search of the Lost Sound") from the Cantemir transcriptions using period instruments.&lt;REF NAME="bezmara"&gt; {{cite AV media notes |title    = In Search of the Lost Sound |year     = 1999 |others   = [[Bezmara]] |type     = album booklet |publisher= [[Kalan Müzik]] |location = Istanbul |id       = EAN 8691834003576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Golden Horn Records released ''Cantemir'', a CD exploring his compositions, his European contemporaries, and the folk music of Moldavia performed by [[İhsan Özgen]] and the Lux Musica ensemble under [[Linda Burman-Hall]]'s direction.

Due to his many esteemed works he won great renown at the high courts of Europe. His name is among those who were considered to be the brightest minds of the world on a plaque at the Library of Sainte-Genevieve in [[Paris]], next to those of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz|Leibniz]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Alexis Piron|Piron]], and other great thinkers.

==Istanbul Museum==
One of the houses inhabited by Dimitrie Cantemir during his exile in Constantinople was restored and opened as a museum in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simina|first1=Stan|title=Dimitrie Cantemir are un muzeu în Istanbul|url=http://jurnalul.ro/timp-liber/casa/dimitrie-cantemir-are-un-muzeu-in-istanbul-313524.html|website=jurnalul.ro|accessdate=29 July 2014|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies in [[Fener]] quarter of [[Fatih|the walled city]] between [[Phanar Greek Orthodox College|Phanar College]] and the [[Golden Horn]]

==Relations with Russians==
In late 1710 Dimitrie Cantemir took the Moldovan throne with strong support from Peter the First. On 14 July 1711 Dimitrie Cantemir battled the Turks and high nobility in Stanilesti with 500 Russian cavalry troops coming to his aid. The first day showed a clear victory for the Moldovian troops, but as the days passed, a huge 72,000 army led by Pasha annihilated them and in just 4 days Moldova was occupied. Dimitrie Cantemir died in 1721 after the Persian campaign. His mark on the Russian history didn't go unnoticed, with monuments in Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Kiev and Iasi.

'''Elli Lambridi''' ({{Lang-el|Ελλη Λαμπριδη or Ελλης Λαμπριδη}}; 22 January 1896 – 28 January 1970), also spelled '''Helle Lampride''' or '''Helle Lambridis''', was a Greek [[philosopher]] who wrote extensively in the fields of ancient and modern philosophy. She also wrote on [[archaeology]], wrote fiction and produced translations. She was also an educator and was active in Greek left-wing politics and feminism from an early age. It has been claimed that her prominence in twentieth-century Greek philosophy has "only recently become widely known".&lt;ref&gt;Vrasilis Karalis, ‘In Search of Neo-Hellenic Culture’, Interactions 3/2 (2012), pp. 129-145, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Her life and work was acknowledged on 8 March 2017 at an event in the Senate Chamber of Athens Parliament.

== Early life ==

Elli Lambridi was born in Athens on 22 January 1896. Her father, Ioanni Lambridi, from [[Doliana]], Epirus, was a lawyer and senator in the first Venizelos administration, and known for his work concerning the liberation of Epirus. Her mother Sofia was Athenian, her family from [[Mytilene]]. Lambridi graduated from a boy’s grammar school in Athens, then studied Classics at the [[University of Athens]] (1911-1916).
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
She was awarded a postgraduate scholarship to study in Zurich in 1917, which she completed in philosophy and [[pedagogy]]. She received her PhD in 1919 with a thesis on [[Aristotle]]’s principles of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Yolanda Hatzi, 'Emeis' in Elli Lambridi, ''Introduction to Philosophy'', pp. 363-365, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; During this time in Zurich, she met Nikos Kazantzakis, with whom she went on a number of journeys through Switzerland between January and September 1918, beginning with a "pilgrimage" to the [[Upper Engadine]] in the footsteps of [[Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Kazantzakis, ''Nikos Kazantzakis. A Biography Based on His Letters'', pp. 68-71; A. Anemoyannis, ''Nikos Kazantzakis. Letters to Stavridakis'', pp. 29-58; P. Bien, ''The Selected Letters of Nikos Kazantzakis'', pp. 72-75; P. Bien, ''Kazantzakis. Politics of Spirit v. 1'', p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; Kazantzakis later nicknamed her "Mudita", meaning "joy at the pleasure of others".&lt;ref&gt;Bien, ''Kazantzakis. Politics of Spirit, v. 1'', p. 363, n.25; Garitsis, ''Elli Lambridi'', p. 134, n.4&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship continued on and off until 1957.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nikos Kazantzakis and Elli Lambridi, Graetchen 1918.jpg|thumb|At Graetchen, 1918]] --&gt;

== Writing and political activities ==

After completing her PhD in 1919, she travelled from Zurich to London where she attended London Teacher's College in 1919. In 1920, she moved to [[Constantinople]], commencing work at the [[American College for Girls]], as well as teaching at Zappeion Teachers College and the Stavrodromiou Central School for Girls. She married Kostas Stylianopoulos in [[London]] in 1922. In the wake of the Catastrophe, they moved to Athens in 1923. Lambridi was appointed headmistress at the American College for Girls in Athens, where she organised the programme for the Greek department. Her daughter, Nike, was born in 1923; however, the couple were divorced soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzi, ''Elli Lambridi and Nike'', 231; Garitsis, ''Elli Lambridi'', pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Lambridi continued teaching and became engaged in philosophical and political issues. In 1926, she travelled to Paris as an envoy of the ''Free Press'' newspaper to participate in the 10th Congress of the International Alliance for Women's Vote. In 1928, she resigned from the College in Athens and over the following two years dedicated herself to philosophical research and writing . Among other projects, she undertook a philosophical series for Ellinika Philla, wrote numerous essays on philosophy and psychology for the periodical ''Anagennisi'' and philosophical entries for an encyclopaedia. In 1929, she published ''Bergson and his Philosophy'', and ''The Aegean: Cretan-Mycenean Political Structure''. In 1930, she travelled to Prague to attend the Congress of the [[International Federation of University Women]].&lt;ref&gt;Garitsis, ''Elli Lambridi'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Lambridi returned to teaching in 1930, having been appointed Deputy Director of Teaching at Marasleio Teachers College. In 1931, she travelled to America to attend the Congress of the International Federation of University Women. In 1932, she was Deputy Director, first at Tripoli and then at Lamia Teachers Colleges. Her formal pedagogical career ended when she was forced to leave her position in July 1935, for political reasons, following the failed attempt by Venizelos to regain power. 
	
Lambridi worked as a private teacher in Athens, but devoted her time to studying and writing philosophy. She attended soirees in Kydhathineon Street, [[Plaka]], Athens (the home of [[Konstantinos Tsatsos]], later President of Greece), and in 1937-1939 presented a series of lectures in philosophy at the cultural association, Askraios.&lt;ref&gt;K. Despotopolous, Foreword to Elli Lambridi, ''Introduction to Philosophy'', p. 7; Hatzi, 'Emies', p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; These were very successful, attracting large audiences, and from these courses eventually came her ''Introduction to Philosophy'' (1965, 2004). In 1939, she published an extended critical review of the ''[[The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel|Odyssey]]'' by [[Nikos Kazantzakis|Kazantzakis]] in ''Neohellenica Grammata'' (''Modern Greek Literature'') which drew a hostile response.&lt;ref&gt;Bien, ''Kazantzakis v. 1'', pp. 139, 194; Bien, ''Kazantzakis v. 2'', p. 36; Garitsis, ''Elli Lambridi'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; She also published many other articles in various literary and philosophical publications.

== War years ==

Lambridi received a scholarship from the British Council to study the English education system at London’s [[UCL Institute of Education|Institute of Education]] and arrived in London in September, 1939. As well as her studies, she also attended lectures by [[Wittgenstein]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. The occupation of Europe during the war stopped her returning to Greece, and she offered her services to the Greek Government in exile in London, and in 1941 was appointed Director of the Ministry of Information, undertaking various activities, including BBC interviews, producing newsletters and teaching Greek to English SAS officers to be engaged in the Greek resistance movement.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzi, 'Emeis', p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Elli Lambridi, London ca. 1939.jpg|thumb|right|Elli Lambridi, London]]	 --&gt;
Lambridi returned to Greece in early 1945, only to be informed that her daughter, who had spent the war with family and friends, had been hit by shrapnel from a British mortar a few days earlier. The ambulance carrying Niki to hospital had then been bombed. She died on 3 Jan 1945, aged 22, an innocent victim of the [[Dekemvriana]].&lt;ref&gt;Hatzi, ''Elli Lambridi and Nike'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Lambridi later published an account of her daughter’s life told in parallel to contemporary Greek history entitled ''Nike'' (Victory).
	
Lambridi remained in Greece for about a year before returning to the UK. While in London, she became a member of the [[League for Democracy in Greece]] and sat on the Board with ten British Labour MPs.&lt;ref&gt;Garitsis, ''Elli Lambridi'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of her association with the League, her passport was confiscated by the Greek Government in 1947 and she remained in London for another ten years. During this time she continued to write, working on ''Nike'', other fictional works, various philosophical projects and translations.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzi, 'Emeis', pp. 364-365&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to Greece ==

After regaining her passport, she was able to return to Greece in 1960, where she published ''Nike'' and continued work on a number of philosophical and literary projects. She also became a member of the [[Socialist Democratic Union]] (SDE) and, in the 1964 election, was nominated as a candidate by the Socialist Party/Greek Popular Movement for Independence. In 1964, she became a member of the Société Européenne de Culture and in 1965 she travelled to Russia to participate in the Conference of the International Federation of Democratic Women.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzi, 'Emeis', p. 364-365; Garitsis, ''Elli Lambridi'', pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967, the military dictatorship (21 April 1967 to 23 July 1974) cancelled her passport and banned the publication of the second volume of ''Introduction to Philosophy''. In her later years, she produced a manuscript on [[Empedocles]] in English (published posthumously in the US) and was contracted to produce another work on [[Protagoras]]. She died in Athens on 28 January 1970 and is buried in the [[First Cemetery of Athens|First Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Hatzi, 'Emeis', p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Elli Lambridi Library ==
At Lambridi’s request, the Elli Lambridi Philosophical Library was established after her death by the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] and her brothers in Ypsilanto Street, [[Kolonaki]], Athens on the basis of a small legacy and with the help of her executors. In her will, she explained that "philosophy and philosophical education was completely neglected in Greece, and although she had studied philosophy constantly, she had not completed her mission, which was to make philosophy the ultimate purpose of her life". The library is administered by the Academy of Athens and contains Lambridi’s personal collection which ranges from logic and analytic philosophy to the history of religion and a general range of philosophy texts in Greek, German, French and English.&lt;ref&gt;Bien, ''Kazantzakis'', p. 263, n. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The library also holds many other philosophical works. Among Lambridi’s manuscripts is a comprehensive history of ancient Greek philosophy and many works on modern analytic philosophy, as well as papers on Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre and others and the unfinished ''Fantasia Philosophica''. She also prepared a work on traditional and modern logic that she regarded as her written philosophical legacy, which is still unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Garitsis, ''Elli Lambridi'', pp. 27-28; Hatzi, 'Emeis', p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary legacy ==
Lambridi published over 100 works on many topics. A comprehensive bibliography has been produced by the Elli Lambridi Library. Elli Lambridi’s archive is held at ELIA, (ΕΛΙΑ, ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΟ ΛΟΓΟΤΕΧΝΙΚΟ ΙΣΤΟΡΙΚΟ ΑΡΧΕΙΟ), with an analytical index compiled by Yolanda Hatzi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4827">'''Experimental aesthetics''' is a field of [[psychology]] founded by [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] in the 19th century. According to Fechner, [[aesthetics]] is an [[Experience|experiential]] perception which is [[Empiricism|empirically]] comprehensible in light of the characteristics of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] undergoing the experience and those of the [[Object (philosophy)|object]]. Experimental aesthetics is the second oldest research area in psychology, [[psychophysics]] being the only field which is older.&lt;ref&gt;Fechner, G. T. (1860), ''Elemente der Psychophysik'' ("Elements of psychophysics"), Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, Leipzig&lt;/ref&gt; In his central work ''[[Vorschule der Ästhetik]]'' ("Introduction to aesthetics") Fechner describes his empirical approach extensively and in detail. Experimental aesthetics is characterized by a subject-based, [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] approach.

Nowadays, psychologists and neuroscientists define the field of aesthetics more narrowly as considering the perception, creation, and evaluation of objects that evoke an intense feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chatterjee|first=Anjan|date=January 2011|title=Neuroaesthetics: a coming of age story|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=23|issue=1|pages=53–62|doi=10.1162/jocn.2010.21457|issn=1530-8898|pmid=20175677}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a specialized sub-field of empirical aesthetics that distinguishes itself by using [[experiments]] to test [[causal]] hypotheses. In contrast, empirical aesthetics also embraces [[Survey methodology|survey]] studies, [[Field research|field observations]], and other non-experimental methods.

Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the [[natural science]]s. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] or [[neuroscience]] ([[neuroaesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (2007), ''Recent trends in the psychological study of aesthetics, creativity, and the arts''. In ''Empirical Studies of the Arts'', 25(2), p. 121-141.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Methodology ==

The analysis of individual experience and behavior based on experimental methods is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art,&lt;ref&gt;Kobbert, M. (1986), ''Kunstpsychologie'' ("Psychology of art"), Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt&lt;/ref&gt; music, or modern items such as websites&lt;ref&gt;Thielsch, M. T. (2008), ''Ästhetik von Websites. Wahrnehmung von Ästhetik und deren Beziehung zu Inhalt, Usability und Persönlichkeitsmerkmalen.'' ("The aesthetics of websites.  Perception of aesthetics and its relation to content, usability, and personality traits."), MV Wissenschaft, Münster&lt;/ref&gt; or other IT products&lt;ref&gt;Hassenzahl, M. (2008), ''Aesthetics in interactive products: Correlates and consequences of beauty''. In H. N. J. Schifferstein &amp; P. Hekkert (Eds.): ''Product Experience.'' (pp. 287-302). Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; is studied. Data can be examined and analyzed at three levels:

#[[Physiological]] level
#[[Phenomenology (psychology)|Phenomenological]] level (experience)
#[[Behavioral]] level

Here it is difficult to assign an absolute value to the aesthetics of an object. However, one can measure, for example, what percentage of subjects classify an object as beautiful or how many prefer this object to others.

Depending on the approach, a number of different methods are used in experimental aesthetics, such as [[pairwise comparison]]s, rank order methods, [[Likert scale]]s and [[semantic differential]]s, production methods, statistical comparisons of groups, [[Mental chronometry|reaction time measurements]], and also more complex methods such as [[eye tracking]], [[electroencephalography]], and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]].

'''''Four Dissertations''''' is a collection of four essays by the Scottish enlightenment philosopher [[David Hume]], first published in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hume |first=David|year=1757 |title=  Four Dissertations |publisher=A. Millar in the Strand |place=London |edition= 1 |page=  |url=https://books.google.bg/books?id=tNcNAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=david%20hume%20four%20dissertations&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP13#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20hume%20four%20dissertations&amp;f=false  |accessdate= 15 June 2015}} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;  The four essays are:

&lt;ol type=I&gt;&lt;li&gt;''The Natural History of Religion''
&lt;li&gt;''Of the Passions''
&lt;li&gt;''Of Tragedy''
&lt;li&gt;''Of the Standard of Taste''&lt;/ol&gt;

== ''The Natural History of Religion'' ==

In this essay, Hume offers a pioneering [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] account of the causes, effects, and historical development of religious belief.  Hume argues that a crude polytheism was the earliest religion of mankind and locates the origins of religion in emotion, particularly hope, fear, and the desire to control the future.  He further argues that [[monotheism]] arises from competition between religions, as believers seek to distinguish their deities as superior to all rivals, magnifying those deities until they possess all perfections. Though an enlightened monotheism is more rationally defensible than a superstitious polytheism, in practice polytheism has many advantages. In particular, Hume argues, monotheistic religions tend to be more intolerant and hypocritical, result in greater intellectual absurdities, and foster socially undesirable "monkish virtues," such as mortification, abasement, and passive suffering.&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''The Natural History of Religion''. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1956, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume concludes the "Natural History" on a note of characteristic skepticism:

{{quote|text=The whole is a riddle, an aenigma, an inexplicable mystery. Doubt, uncertainty, suspence of judgment appear the only result of our most accurate scrutiny, concerning this subject. But such is the frailty of human reason, and such the irresistible contagion of opinion, that even this deliberate doubt could scarcely be upheld; did we not enlarge our view, and opposing one species of superstition to another, set them a quarrelling; while we ourselves, during their fury and contention, happily make our escape, into the calm, though obscure, regions of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, ''Natural History'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== ''Of the Passions'' ==
Hume begins the passions by giving a trite example of what Good and Evil are. Good, being pleasure. Evil, being pain. He then begins to analyze emotion as a reasoning faculty of the human mind. He argues that not only can emotions mix, they can also destroy one another. He also argues that our imagination and sentiments combine to create an impression of something/someone. For example, you see your grade on a test and it is good, you then attribute that good grade to having a good teacher, and even maybe an interest in the class as well. Hume tries to exclude religion from our reasoning faculty of right and wrong in that we make our decisions based on the over-riding passion during that moment. Your wife may divorce you, but I bet winning the lottery would make you forget about it. He concludes by saying that this mixture of emotion and sentiments give rise to hope and fear, which gives rise to religion in ancient society.

== ''Of Tragedy'' ==

''Of Tragedy'', is where Hume considered why we enjoy tragic drama. He was concerned with why spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He decided that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a dramatic performance. There is pleasure in realizing that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, CM., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSXlNY6xIMoC&amp;pg=PA324 ''David Hume: Reason in History''], Penn State Press, 2010, pp. 325-326.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Of the Standard of Taste'' ==
''Of the Standard of Taste'' was a seminal essay on [[aesthetics]] that is innovative because it requires Hume to address the apparent relativity of taste, a conclusion that appears to follow from his own assumption that the "good" or "beauty" of a good work of art is identical with the positive human responses it generates. The essay's focus on the subject (the viewer, the reader) rather than the object (the painting, the book) is typical of the British "sentimentalists" or moral sense theorists of the eighteenth century.  Unlike the French philosophers of the eighteenth century, who sought an objective definition of beauty, the British school tended to look for the connections between taste and aesthetic judgments.

===Summary===
Hume begins with the observation that there is much variety in people's taste (or the aesthetic judgments people make). However, Hume argues that there is a common mechanism in human nature that gives rise to, and often even provides justification for, such judgments. He takes this aesthetic sense to be quite similar to the [[moral sense theory|moral sense]] for which he argues in his Book 3 of ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739–1740) and in ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751). Furthermore, he argues that this still leaves room for the ability to refine one's aesthetic palate. (Fieser, 2006, §2)

Hume took as his premise that the great diversity and disagreement regarding matters of taste had two basic sources - sentiment, which was to some degree naturally varying, and critical facility, which could be cultivated.  Each person is a combination of these of two sources, and Hume endeavours to delineate the admirable qualities of a critic, that they might augment their natural sense of beauty into a reliable faculty of judgment. There are a variety of qualities of the good [[critic]] that he describes, each of which contributes to an ultimately reliable and just ability to judge.

"'''Free Will Hunting'''" is the ninth episode of the [[Futurama (season 7)|seventh season]] of the animated sitcom ''[[Futurama]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] on August 8, 2012.

The episode was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Raymie Muzquiz.

==Plot==
Enrolling in college on a whim, Bender gets a questionable student loan from the [[Robot Mafia]] and falls in with a bad crowd. He then promptly drops out of college, gets addicted to robot drug "Spark," does dubious acts for Hedonismbot, and ultimately attempts to rob Girl Scouts (only for them to turn the tables on him) to earn money. His downward spiral leads to his arrest and trial, but his lawyer argues that as a robot, Bender lacks [[free will]] and that it was his programming that led to the sequence of events. The judge rules Bender not guilty, much to Bender's dismay.

The Planet Express crew is hired to deliver a package to Chapek 9 (last seen in "[[Fear of a Bot Planet]]"), requiring a despondent Bender to come along due to the native robots' intense hatred of humans. After delivering the package, Bender decides to stay on the planet, going on a journey of self-discovery. He eventually finds a religious [[monastery]] control by robotic [[monk]] named Ab-bot who call their religion "Order of the Binary Singularity" to take him in. From them, he learns that every Mom Corp. robot has a free will slot, so that they could be upgraded if a corresponding free will unit were ever invented. Bender returns to Earth to find more answers (and walks in on Fry and Leela together in bed).

Bender, Fry, and Leela reach the secret laboratory where the module may be kept, but they find Mom waiting for them there. She reveals that a free will unit was designed by Prof. Farnsworth years earlier when he worked at Mom Corp. Farnsworth never completed it after learning of Mom's plan to use the unit to cause a robot uprising that would then be repelled by obedient robots. Bender returns to Planet Express and asks Farnsworth about the module. The Professor admits that he had finished making one complete free will unit, which he has hidden in a talking Bender toy. Bender attempts to use a gun on Farnsworth to force him to hand it over, but Bender discovers that the Professor had programmed a failsafe in all robots that prevents them from taking the unit or attacking Farnsworth. Farnsworth inserts the unit into Bender to give Bender a sample of what free will is like.  At first, when Bender attempts to shoot Farnsworth again, it appears the unit is not working.  Bender then remembers he forgot to turn off the gun's [[Safety (firearms)|safety]], and shoots the Professor.  Bender is taken to court and, now that he has free will, is found guilty of attempted murder. The crew of Planet Express celebrate (except for a severely injured Farnsworth) with Bender as he is taken away.

Over the end credits is a rap video featuring Bender and several floozy-bots from previous episodes (such as Hookerbot 5000 from "[[Hell is Other Robots]]" and the two Jewish-American princess robots from "[[The Bots and the Bees]]").

'''Hermann Conring''' (November 9, 1606 – December 12, 1681) was a German [[intellectual]]. He made significant contributions to the study of [[medicine]], [[politics]] and [[jurisprudence|law]].

Descended from [[Lutheran]] clergy on both sides of his family, second-youngest of ten children, Conring showed early promise as a student. During his life as a professor in North Germany, Conring addressed himself first to medicine, producing significant studies on blood circulation, and later in his career addressed himself to politics.

== Early life ==

Conring was born in [[Norden, Lower Saxony|Norden]], a coastal town in [[East Frisia]], a territory ruled at that time by the [[List of Counts of Ostfriesland|counts of Cirksena]]. Like many areas of what would later become Germany, Conring's homeland exhibited considerable religious variety and strife. Lutheran in the countryside (and in the piety of its counts), East Frisia nonetheless sheltered a bastion of Calvinism in its chief city, [[Emden]]. Conring and his family were no strangers to confessional altercations. Many of Conring's forebears were ministers, and his father and paternal grandfather, in particular, were apparently compelled to change their circumstances on several occasions in response to Protestant religious conflict.

Conring was one of ten siblings, two of whom died in infancy, six more of whom died of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in 1611.

== Schooling ==

Conring began his schooling early, as befit a descendant of literate clerical forebears, entering school in Norden at the age of six, and beginning his studies in [[Latin]] a year later. About ninety years earlier, [[Martin Luther|Luther]] had bestowed a powerful legitimacy upon the [[German language]] with his [[Luther Bible|translation of the Bible into German]], but, as in other European countries, Latin remained the official language of learning for centuries. By the age of 14, Conring had developed into a skilled Latinist, broadly familiar with ancient [[classics|classical writings]] and with the leading Latin writers of his own day and region.

In 1620, at the age of 14, Conring began to take courses in the philosophy curriculum at the [[University of Helmstedt]], one of the leading northern European universities of its day, where he would study for the next five years.

==Teaching==

Lindenfeld calls Conring a [[Neo-Aristotelian]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindenfeld 1997, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''philosophy'' meant something rather different in his time. It referred to a branch of inquiry that sought chiefly to explicate law, religion and politics in terms laid down by ancient thinkers, particularly [[Aristotle]], who in Conring's circles would often have been known simply as "the philosopher". Lindenfeld says that in 1660 Conring was the first to lecture on ''Statistik'', the forerunner of modern [[government statistics]]; but the topic was [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindenfeld 1997, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Idols to Die''''' is the second scholarly book by [[Kuruvilla Pandikattu]]. It is about [[Paul Ricoeur]]'s attempts at understanding symbols, idols and religion.

This book deals with the need for interpretation or [[hermeneutics]] in our life. It goes beyond the naive understandings of symbols and idols and applies them to the religious and ordinary life. Its basic insight is that everything - including God - can be positively or negatively interpreted and experienced. So the need for eternal vigilance, so that we are aware of our human tendencies to idolise almost anything in our life.

This book understands [[hermeneutics]]not merely an intellectual but as an [[existential]] activity.

The full title of the book is: ''[[Cult image|Idols]] to die, [[symbol]]s to live : dynamic interaction between language, reality, and the divine.'' It is based on his doctoral thesis completed at the [[University of Innsbruck]], in 1996. The book is a study on Paul Ricoeur, the French philosopher.

The '''''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''''' ('''''IEP''''') is a scholarly [[online encyclopedia]], dealing with [[philosophy]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]] topics, and [[philosophers]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University ARCH Project, http://arch.oucs.ox.ac.uk/detail/87371/index.html, accessed 11 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The IEP combines [[open access]] publication with [[peer reviewed]] publication of original papers. Contribution is generally by invitation, and contributors are recognized and leading international specialists within their field.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University ARCH Project, http://arch.oucs.ox.ac.uk/detail/87371/index.html, accessed 11 September 2017. See also Kooy, B. 2015. 'Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy', in ''Reference Review,'' Vol.29, No. 4, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''IEP'' was founded by philosopher [[James Fieser]] in 1995, operating through a [[non-profit]] organization with the aim of providing accessible and scholarly information on philosophy.&lt;ref Kooy, B. 2015. 'Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy', in ''Reference Review,'' Vol.29,No.4, p.12; see also name="iepabout"&gt;{{cite web | title = About the IEP | url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/home/about/ | work = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current general editors are philosophers James Fieser and [[Bradley Dowden]], with the staff also including numerous area editors as well as volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;'Law in free internet encyclopedia of philosophy (SEP and IEP)', in ''University of Chicago Library News'', 22 January 2011, http://news.lib.uchicago.edu/blog/2011/01/22/law-in-free-internet-encyclopedias-of-philosophy-sep-iep/, accessed 11 September 2017; see also Kooy, B. 2015. 'Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy', in ''Reference Review,'' Vol.29,No.4, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire website was redesigned in the summer of 2009, moving from static HTML pages to the open-source publishing platform [[WordPress]].&lt;ref name="iepstaff"&gt;{{cite web | title = IEP Staff | url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/iep-staff/ | work = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization ==
The intended audience for the ''IEP'' is philosophy students and faculty who are not specialists within the field, and thus articles are written in an accessible style.&lt;ref&gt;Kooy, B. 2015. 'Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy', in ''Reference Review,'' Vol. 29, No. 4, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Articles consist of a brief survey or overview, followed by the body of the article, and an annotated bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;Kooy, B. 2015. 'Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy', in ''Reference Review,'' Vol.29, No.4, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Articles are searchable either by an alphabetical index or through a Google-power search mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Kooy, B. 2015. 'Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy', in ''Reference Review,'' Vol.29, No.4, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[Similarweb]] analytics suggest that the ''IEP'' website is accessed worldwide between two and three million times per month.&lt;ref&gt;Similarweb data on IEP, at www.similarweb.com, accessed 18 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 75% of this usage is through internet searches, 18% is through direct access, and 5% through referral, with the referring websites including other reference websites and university library guides.&lt;ref&gt;Similarweb data on IEP, at www.similarweb.com, accessed 18 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
The ''IEP'' is included by the [[American Library Association]] in its listing of Best Free Reference Sites;&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association (Reference and User Services Association) website, http://www.ala.org/rusa/sections/ets/pubs/bestfreewebsites2016, accessed 11 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; listed as an online philosophy resource by the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations;&lt;ref&gt;Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations, http://fapsa.org.au/resources/guides-to-philosophy/, accessed 12 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  listed by EpistemeLinks as one of the "outstanding resources" in philosophy on the internet;&lt;ref&gt;EpistemeLinks, http://epistemelinks.com/, accessed 12 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and listed as a reliable resource in many university philosophy guides.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, Cambridge University, http://libguides.cam.ac.uk/philosophy/eresources, accessed 12 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Thomas Cushing''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|ʃ|ɪ|ŋ}}; 4 February 1937 – 29 March 2002) was an [[Americans|American]] [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and [[philosopher of science]]. He was professor of physics as well as professor of philosophy at the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Howard, Don|author2=McGlinn, William|title=Obituary: James Thomas Cushing|journal=Physics Today|date=October 2002|volume=55|issue=10|pages=70|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/55/10/10.1063/1.1522181|doi=10.1063/1.1522181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
He studied physics in several universities in the USA, obtaining his [[BSc]] from [[Loyola University, Chicago]], Illinois in 1959, his [[MSc]] from [[Northwestern University]] in 1960 and his [[PhD]], also in physics, from the [[University of Iowa]] in 1963. He then performed research at the [[University of Iowa]], the [[Imperial College]] in [[London]] and the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], after which he joined the University of Notre Dame, initially as assistant professor from 1966 to 1969, then advancing to associate professor and, from 1978 onwards, as professor of physics. From 1990 to 1993, he additionally was professor of philosophy at the same university.

Cushing's main areas of research were the history and philosophy of 20th century physics and the foundations of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. He investigated in particular [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], including the historical reasons for the success of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] over [[Hidden-variable theory|hidden-variable theories]] or the [[de Broglie–Bohm theory]] (causal interpretation of quantum mechanics).

Since 2004, an annual prize is awarded in honor of James T. Cushing to younger scholars for significant work in the history and philosophical foundations of modern physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nd.edu/~cushpriz/ The Cushing Memorial Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

'''Jean Ladrière''' (September 7, 1921– November 26, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academieroyale.be/n15197/Jean.Ladri%C3%A8re|title=Jean Ladrière|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] logician and philosopher. He was professor at the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Louvain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uclouvain.be/286669.html|title=Fonds Jean Ladrière|first=Thierry|last=Scaillet|date=17 July 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228025622/http://www.uclouvain.be/286669.html|archivedate=28 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1959 to 1986, where he was chair of the Institute of Philosophy from 1977 to 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uclouvain.be/436992.html|title=Biographie|first=Thierry|last=Scaillet|date=24 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall project animating his work (650 scientific articles, partially assembled into a dozen volumes) was to develop, in his words, "a report that is not a simple confrontation, but a justified report to the both reflected and lived between the [[Christian faith|(Christian) faith]] and reason ", especially scientific and philosophical reason.

'''John Winthrop''' (12 January 1587/88&lt;ref name=dates/&gt; – 26 March 1649) was an English [[Puritan]] lawyer and one of the leading figures in founding the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], the second major settlement in [[New England]], following [[Plymouth Colony]].  Winthrop led the first large wave of immigrants from England in 1630 and served as governor for 12 of the colony's first 20 years.  His writings and vision of the colony as a Puritan "[[city upon a hill]]" dominated New England colonial development, influencing the governments and religions of neighboring colonies.

Winthrop was born into a wealthy landowning and merchant family. He trained in the law and became [[Lord of the Manor]] at [[Groton, Suffolk|Groton]] in [[Suffolk]].  He was not involved in founding the [[Massachusetts Bay Company]] in 1628, but he became involved in 1629 when anti-Puritan [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] began a crackdown on [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist]] religious thought.  In October 1629, he was elected governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and he led a group of colonists to the [[New World]] in April 1630, founding a number of communities on the shores of [[Massachusetts Bay]] and the [[Charles River]].

Between 1629 and his death in 1649, he served 18 annual terms as governor or lieutenant-governor and was a force of comparative moderation in the religiously conservative colony, clashing with the more conservative [[Thomas Dudley]] and the more liberal [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] and [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]].  Winthrop was a respected political figure, and his attitude toward governance seems authoritarian to modern sensibilities. He resisted attempts to widen voting and other civil rights beyond a narrow class of religiously approved individuals, opposed attempts to codify a body of laws that the colonial magistrates would be bound by, and also opposed unconstrained democracy, calling it "the meanest and worst of all forms of government".&lt;ref name=Mor92/&gt; The authoritarian and religiously conservative nature of Massachusetts rule was influential in the formation of neighboring colonies, which were formed in some instances by individuals and groups opposed to the rule of the Massachusetts elders.

Winthrop's son [[John Winthrop the Younger|John]] was one of the founders of the [[Connecticut Colony]], and Winthrop himself wrote one of the leading historical accounts of the early colonial period.  His long list of descendants includes famous Americans, and his writings continue to influence politicians today.

==Life in England==
John Winthrop was born on 12 January 1587/8&lt;ref name=dates&gt;In the [[Julian calendar]], then in use in England, the year began on March 25.  To avoid confusion with dates in the [[Gregorian calendar]], then in use in other parts of Europe, dates between January and March were often written with both years.  Dates in this article are in the Julian calendar unless otherwise noted.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; to Adam and Anne (née Browne) Winthrop in [[Edwardstone]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]].  His birth was recorded in the parish register at [[Groton, Suffolk|Groton]].&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 403, notes the distinction that not all of the Winthrop children were recorded in the Edwardstone parish register.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father's family had been successful in the textile business, and his father was a lawyer and prosperous landowner with several properties in Suffolk.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother's family was also well-to-do, with properties in Suffolk and [[Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  When Winthrop was young, his father became a director at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  Winthrop's uncle John (Adam's brother) emigrated to Ireland, and the Winthrop family took up residence at Groton Manor.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Winthrop was first tutored at home by John Chaplin and was assumed to have attended grammar school at Bury St. Edmunds.&lt;ref name="Winthrop, John"/&gt; He was also regularly exposed to religious discussions between his father and clergymen, and thus came to a deep understanding of theology at an early age.  He was admitted to Trinity College in December 1602,&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; matriculating at the university a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id= WNTP603J|name=Winthrop, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the students with whom he would have interacted were [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]] and [[John Wheelwright]], two men who also had important roles in [[New England]].&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close childhood and university friend of [[William Spring of Pakenham|William Spring]], later a Puritan Member of Parliament with whom he corresponded for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Thrush and John P. Ferris, 'SPRING, Sir William (1588–1638)', ''The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1604–1629'' (2010), from History of Parliament online (Accessed 11 March 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The teenage Winthrop admitted in his diary of the time to "lusts ... so masterly as no good could fasten upon me."&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;  Biographer Francis Bremer suggests that Winthrop's need to control his baser impulses may have prompted him to leave school early and marry at an unusually early age.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 84, 90&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1604, Winthrop journeyed to [[Stambridge|Great Stambridge]] in Essex with a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  They stayed at the home of a family friend, and Winthrop was favorably impressed with their daughter Mary Forth.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  He left Trinity College to marry her on 16 April 1605 at Great Stambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bremmer|first1=Francis|title=Winthrop, John|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29778?docPos=2|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary bore him five children, of whom only three survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=M268_70&gt;Moore, pp. 268–270&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest of their children was [[John Winthrop, the Younger]], who became a governor and magistrate of [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=Mayo5961&gt;Mayo (1948), pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ProcMHS2&gt;''Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Their last two children, two girls, died not long after birth, and Mary died in 1615 from complications of the last birth.&lt;ref name=M268_70/&gt;  The couple spent most of their time at Great Stambridge, living on the Forth estate.&lt;ref name=B91&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1613, Adam Winthrop transferred the family holdings in Groton to Winthrop, who then became [[Lord of the Manor]] at Groton.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 98–100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord of the Manor===
As Lord of the Manor, Winthrop was deeply involved in the management of the estate, overseeing the agricultural activities and the manor house.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  He eventually followed his father in practicing law in London, which would have brought him into contact with the city's business elite.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also appointed to the county [[commission of the peace]], a position that gave him a wider exposure among other lawyers and landowners, and a platform to advance what he saw as God's kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;  The commission's responsibilities included overseeing countywide issues, including road and bridge maintenance and the issuance of licenses.  Some of its members were also empowered to act as local judges for minor offenses, although Winthrop was only able to exercise this authority in cases affecting his estate.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;  The full commission met quarterly, and Winthrop forged a number of important connections through its activities.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 107–109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:JohnWinthropJr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John's eldest son, [[John Winthrop the Younger]]]]
Winthrop documented his religious life, keeping a journal beginning 1605 in which he described his religious experiences and feelings.&lt;ref name=B91/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, he described his failures to keep "divers vows", and sought to reform his failings by God's grace, praying that God would "give me a new heart, joy in his spirit; that he would dwell with me".&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; He was somewhat distressed that his wife did not share the intensity of his religious feelings, but he eventually observed that "she proved after a right godly woman."&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;  He was more intensely religious than his father, whose diaries dealt almost exclusively with secular matters.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife Mary died in 1615, and he followed the custom of the time, marrying Thomasine Clopton soon after on 6 December 1615.  She was more pious than Mary had been; Winthrop wrote that she was "truly religious &amp; industrious therein".&lt;ref name=B103/&gt;  Thomasine died on 8 December 1616 from complications of childbirth; the child did not survive.&lt;ref name=B103&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

In approximately 1613 (records indicate that it may have been earlier), Winthrop was enrolled at [[Gray's Inn]].  There he [[reading law|read the law]] but did not [[called to the Bar|advance to the Bar]].&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  His legal connections introduced him to the Tyndal family of [[Great Maplestead]], [[Essex]] and he began courting [[Margaret Tyndal Winthrop|Margaret Tyndal]] in 1617, the daughter of Sir John Tyndal, a [[Court of Chancery|chancery]] judge, and his wife Anne Egerton, sister of the leading Puritan preacher [[Stephen Egerton (clergyman)|Stephen Egerton]].  Her family was initially opposed to the match on financial grounds;&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; Winthrop countered by appealing to [[piety]] as a virtue that more than compensated for his modest income.  The couple were married on 29 April 1618 at [[Great Maplestead]].&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;  They continued to live at Groton, although Winthrop necessarily divided his time between Groton and London, where he eventually acquired a highly desirable post in the [[Court of Wards and Liveries]].  His eldest son John sometimes assisted Margaret with the management of the estate while he was away.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 117–125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision to emigrate===
In the mid to late 1620s, the religious atmosphere in England began to look bleak for Puritans and other groups whose adherents believed that the [[English Reformation]] was in danger.  [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had ascended the throne in 1625, and he had married a Roman Catholic.  Charles was opposed to all manner of [[recusant]]s and supported the [[Church of England]] in its efforts against religious groups such as the Puritans that did not adhere fully to its teachings and practices.&lt;ref name=M64/&gt;  This atmosphere of intolerance led Puritan religious and business leaders to consider emigration to the [[New World]] as a viable means to escape persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:JohnEndecottPortrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Endecott]] preceded Winthrop as governor in Massachusetts]]
The first successful religious colonization of the New World occurred in 1620 with the establishment of the [[Plymouth Colony]] on the shores of [[Cape Cod Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  An effort in 1624 orchestrated by pastor [[John White (colonist priest)|John White]] led to a short-lived colony at [[Cape Ann]], also on the Massachusetts coast.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1628, some of the investors in that effort joined with new investors to acquire a land grant for the territory roughly between the [[Charles River|Charles]] and [[Merrimack River]]s.  It was first styled the New England Company, then renamed the [[Massachusetts Bay Company]] in 1629 after it acquired a royal charter granting it permission to govern the territory.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 31–34&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after acquiring the land grant in 1628, it sent a small group of settlers led by [[John Endecott]] to prepare the way for further migration.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  John Winthrop was apparently not involved in any of these early activities, which involved primarily individuals from [[Lincolnshire]]; however, by early 1629, he was probably aware of the company's activities and plans.  The exact connection is uncertain by which he became involved with the company, because there were many indirect connections between Winthrop and individuals directly associated with the company.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 153–155&lt;/ref&gt;  Winthrop was also aware of attempts to colonize other places; his son [[Henry Winthrop|Henry]] became involved in efforts to settle [[Barbados]] in 1626, which Winthrop financially supported for a time.&lt;ref&gt;Manegold, pp. 8–12&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1629, King Charles dissolved Parliament, beginning [[Personal Rule|eleven years of rule]] without Parliament.&lt;ref name=M64&gt;Morison, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;  This action apparently raised new concerns among the company's principals; in their July meeting, Governor [[Matthew Cradock]] proposed that the company reorganize itself and transport its charter and governance to the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;  It also worried Winthrop, who lost his position in the Court of Wards and Liveries in the crackdown on Puritans that followed the dissolution of Parliament.  He wrote, "If the Lord seeth it wilbe&lt;!--sic--&gt; good for us, he will provide a shelter &amp; a hidinge place for us and others".&lt;ref name=M64/&gt;  During the following months, he became more involved with the company, meeting with others in Lincolnshire.  By early August, he had emerged as a significant proponent of emigration and, on 12 August, he circulated a paper providing eight separate reasons in favor of emigration.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt;  His name appears in formal connection with the company on the [[Cambridge Agreement]], signed 26 August; this document provided means for emigrating shareholders to buy out non-emigrating shareholders of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The company shareholders met on 20 October to enact the changes agreed to in August.  Governor Cradock was not emigrating and a new governor needed to be chosen.  Winthrop was seen as the most dedicated of the three candidates proposed to replace Cradock, and he won the election.  The other two were [[Richard Saltonstall]] and John Humphrey; they had many other interests, and their dedication to settling in Massachusetts was viewed as uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;  Humphrey was chosen as deputy governor, a post that he relinquished the following year when he decided to delay his emigration.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

Winthrop and other company officials then began the process of arranging a transport fleet and supplies for the migration.  He also worked to recruit individuals with special skills that the new colony would require, including pastors to see to the colony's spiritual needs.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

It was unclear to Winthrop when his wife would come over; she was due to give birth in April 1630, near the fleet's departure time.  They consequently decided that she would not come over until a later time; it was not until 1631 that the couple were reunited in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 162, 203&lt;/ref&gt;  To maintain some connection with his wife during their separation, the couple agreed to think of each other between the hours of 5 and 6 in the evening each Monday and Friday.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;  Winthrop also worked to convince his grown children to join the migration; John, Jr. and Henry both decided to do so, but only Henry sailed in the 1630 fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1630, Winthrop had put most of his affairs in order.  Groton Manor had not yet been sold because of a long-running title dispute.  The legal dispute was only resolved after his departure, and the property's sale was finalized by Margaret before she and John Jr. left for the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coat of arms===
[[File:The Coat of Arms of John Winthrop (1587-1649).gif|thumb|The coat of arms of John Winthrop]]

John Winthrop used a [[coat of arms]] that was reportedly confirmed to his paternal uncle by the [[College of Arms]], London in 1592. It was also used by his sons. These arms appear on his tombstone in the [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]]. It is also the coat of arms for [[Winthrop House]] at [[Harvard University]] and is displayed on the 1675 house of his youngest son [[Deane Winthrop]] at the [[Deane Winthrop House]]. The heraldic [[blazon]] of arms is ''Argent three chevronels Gules overall a lion rampant Sable.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arms of the Founders and Leaders of European Settlements in the Present-Day United States|url=https://www.americanheraldry.org/heraldry-in-the-usa/roll-of-early-american-arms/w|publisher=American Heraldry Society|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massachusetts Bay Colony==

===Arrival===
On 8 April 1630, four ships left the [[Isle of Wight]] carrying Winthrop and other leaders of the colony.  Winthrop sailed on the ''[[Arbella]]'', accompanied by his two young sons Samuel&lt;ref&gt;Samuel became a [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Antigua#Governors of Antigua (1632–1671)|governor]] of [[Antigua]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 169, 188–189&lt;/ref&gt;  The ships were part of [[Winthrop Fleet|a larger fleet]] totalling 11 ships that carried about 700 migrants to the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Winthrop's son [[Henry Winthrop]] missed the ''Arbella''{{'s}} sailing and ended up on the ''Talbot'', which also sailed from Wight.&lt;ref name=Mayo5961/&gt;&lt;ref name=ProcMHS2/&gt;  Winthrop wrote a sermon entitled ''[[A Modell of Christian Charity]]'', which was delivered either before or during the crossing.&lt;ref name=B175&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, while also comparing the struggles that they would have to overcome in the New World with the [[Exodus narrative in Antebellum America|story of Exodus]]. In it, he used the now-famous phrase "[[City upon a Hill]]" to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive, and that consequently "the eyes of all people are upon us."&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 175–179&lt;/ref&gt; He also said, "In all times some must be rich some poore, some highe and eminent in power and dignitie; others meane and in subjection"; that is, all societies include some who are rich and successful and others who are poor and subservient—and both groups were equally important to the colony because both groups were members to the same community.&lt;ref name="Winthrop, John"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bremer|first1=Francis|title=Winthrop, John|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29778?docPos=2|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WinthropLanding.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving showing Winthrop's arrival at Salem]]
The fleet arrived at [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] in June and was welcomed by John Endecott.  Winthrop and his deputy [[Thomas Dudley]] found the Salem area inadequate for a settlement suitable for all of the arriving colonists, and they embarked on surveying expeditions of the area.  They first decided to base the colony at [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], but a lack of good water there prompted them to move to the [[Shawmut Peninsula]] where they founded what is now the city of [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayo (1936), pp. 54–58&lt;/ref&gt;  The season was relatively late, and the colonists decided to establish dispersed settlements along the coast and the banks of the [[Charles River]] in order to avoid presenting a single point that hostile forces might attack.

The colony struggled with disease in its early months, losing as many as 200 people to a variety of causes in 1630, including Winthrop's son Henry, and about 80 others who returned to England in the spring due to these conditions.&lt;ref name="Winthrop, John"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B103"/&gt;  Winthrop set an example to the other colonists by working side by side with servants and laborers in the work of the colony.  According to one report, he "fell to work with his own hands, and thereby so encouraged the rest that there was not an idle person to be found in the whole plantation."&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Winthrop built his house in Boston where he also had a relatively spacious plot of arable land.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1631, he was granted a larger parcel of land on the banks of the [[Mystic River]] that he called [[Ten Hills, Somerville, Massachusetts|Ten Hills Farm]].&lt;ref&gt;Manegold, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other side of the Mystic was the shipyard owned in absentia by Matthew Cradock, where one of the colony's first boats was built, Winthrop's ''[[Blessing of the Bay]]''.  Winthrop operated her as a trading and packet ship up and down the coast of New England.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, p. 1:184&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of where to locate the colony's capital caused the first in a series of rifts between Winthrop and Dudley.  Dudley had constructed his home at Newtown (present-day [[Harvard Square]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]) after the council had agreed that the capital would be established there.  However, Winthrop decided instead to build his home in Boston when asked by its residents to stay there.  This upset Dudley, and their relationship worsened when Winthrop criticized Dudley for what he perceived as excessive decorative woodwork in his house.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they seemed to reconcile after their children were married.  Winthrop recounts the two of them, each having been granted land near [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], going to stake their claims.  At the boundary between their lands, a pair of boulders were named the Two Brothers "in remembrance that they were brothers by their children's marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  Dudley's lands became [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]], and Winthrop's [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial governance===
[[Image:JohnWinthrop 1873 OurYoungFolks.png|thumb|right|upright|Engraving depicting Winthrop being carried across the [[Mystic River]]]]
The colony's charter called for a governor, deputy governor, and 18 assistant magistrates who served as a precursor to the idea of a [[Governor's Council]]. All these officers were to be elected annually by the [[freeman (Colonial)|freemen]] of the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  The first meeting of the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] consisted of exactly eight men.  They decided that the governor and deputy should be elected by the assistants, in violation of the charter; under these rules, Winthrop was elected governor three times.  The general court admitted a significant number of settlers, but also established a rule requiring all freemen to be local church members.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  The colony saw a large influx of immigrants in 1633 and 1634, following the appointment of strongly anti-Puritan [[William Laud]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John Winthrop Home Site Charlestown.jpg|thumb|left|Site of the "Great House" near the corner of New Rutherford Avenue and Chelsea Avenue, Charlestown, Massachusetts.  This was the home of John Winthrop and also served as the first seat of government in the colony.]]

When the 1634 election was set to take place, delegations of freemen sent by the towns insisted on seeing the charter, from which they learned that the colony's lawmaking authority, the election of governor, and the election of the deputy all rested with the freemen, not with the assistants.  Winthrop acceded on the point of the elections, which were thereafter conducted by secret ballot by the freemen, but he also observed that lawmaking would be unwieldy if conducted by the relatively large number of freemen.  A compromise was reached in which each town would select two delegates to send to the general court as representatives of its interests.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  In an ironic twist, Thomas Dudley, an opponent of popular election, won the 1634 election for governor, with [[Roger Ludlow]] as deputy.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  Winthrop graciously invited his fellow magistrates to dinner, as he had done after previous elections.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1630s, the seeming arbitrariness of judicial decisions led to calls for the creation of a body of laws that would bind the opinions of magistrates.  Winthrop opposed these moves, and used his power to repeatedly stall and obstruct efforts to enact them.&lt;ref name=B305/&gt;  His opposition was rooted in a strong belief in the [[common law]] tradition and the desire, as a magistrate, to have flexibility in deciding cases on their unique circumstances.  He also pointed out that adoption of written laws "repugnant to the laws of England" was not allowed in the charter, and that some of the laws to be adopted likely opposed English law.&lt;ref name=B306&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was formally adopted during [[Richard Bellingham]]'s governorship in 1641.&lt;ref name=B305&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the laws enacted in Massachusetts were cited as reasons for vacating the colonial charter in 1684.&lt;ref&gt;Osgood, p. 3:334&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1640s, constitutional issues arose concerning the power of the magistrates and assistants. In a case involving an escaped pig, the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow's errant animal. She appealed to the general court, which ruled in her favor. The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court's decision, sparking the controversy. Winthrop argued that the assistants, as experienced magistrates, must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court, because "a democracy is, amongst most civil nations, accounted the meanest and worst of all forms of government."&lt;ref name=Mor92&gt;Morison, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Winthrop became the focus of allegations about the arbitrary rule of the magistrates in 1645, when he was formally charged with interfering with local decisions in a case involving the [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] militia.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;  The case centered around the disputed appointment of a new commander, and a panel of magistrates headed by Winthrop had several parties imprisoned on both sides of the dispute, pending a meeting of the court of assistants.  Peter Hobart, the minister in Hingham and one of several Hobarts on one side of the dispute, vociferously questioned the authority of the magistrates and railed against Winthrop specifically for what he characterized as arbitrary and tyrannical actions.  Winthrop defused the matter by stepping down from the bench to appear before it as a defendant.  He successfully defended himself, pointing out that he had not acted alone, and also that judges are not usually criminally culpable for errors that they make on the bench. He also argued that the dispute in Hingham was serious enough that it required the intervention of the magistrates.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;  Winthrop was acquitted and the complainants were fined.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

One major issue that Winthrop was involved in occurred in 1647, when a petition was submitted to the general court concerning the limitation of voting rights to freemen who had been formally admitted to a local church. Winthrop and the other magistrates rejected the appeal that "civil liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to all truly English", and even fined and imprisoned the principal signers of the petition.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, pp. 1:122–123&lt;/ref&gt;  William Vassal and Robert Child, two of the signatories, pursued complaints against the Massachusetts government in England over this and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1634 and 1635, Winthrop served as an assistant, while the influx of migrants brought first [[John Haynes (governor)|John Haynes]] and then [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]] to the governorship.  Haynes, Vane, [[Anne Hutchinson]], and pastors [[Thomas Hooker]] and [[John Wheelwright]] all espoused religious or political views that were at odds with those of the earlier arrivals, including Winthrop.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 281–285&lt;/ref&gt;  Hutchinson and Wheelwright subscribed to the [[Antinomianism|Antinomian]] view that following religious laws was not required for salvation, while Winthrop and others believed in a more [[Legalism (theology)|Legalist]] view.  This religious rift is commonly called the [[Antinomian Controversy]], and it significantly divided the colony; Winthrop saw the Antinomian beliefs as a particularly unpleasant and dangerous [[heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;  By December 1636, the dispute reached into colonial politics, and Winthrop attempted to bridge the divide between the two factions. He wrote an account of his religious awakening and other theological position papers designed to harmonize the opposing views.  (It is not known how widely these documents circulated, and not all of them have survived.)&lt;!---the following sentence has been hidden because it is incomprehensible what it is referring to: but the Legalist pastor [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard]] reacted in a way that biographer Francis Bremer describes as "horrified", and containing "a color of [[Arminianism]], which I believe your [Winthrop's] soul abhors."&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;  In the 1637 election, Vane was turned out of all offices, and Dudley was elected governor.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Dudley's election did not immediately quell the controversy.  First John Wheelwright and later Anne Hutchinson were put on trial, and both were banished from the colony.&lt;ref name=B293/&gt;  (Hutchinson and others founded the settlement of [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] on [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]]; Wheelwright founded first [[Exeter, New Hampshire]] and then [[Wells, Maine]] in order to be free of Massachusetts rule.)&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golson, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;  Winthrop was active in arguing against their supporters, but Shepard criticized him for being too moderate, claiming that Winthrop should "make their wickedness and guile manifest to all men that they may go no farther and then will sink of themselves."&lt;ref name=B293&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;  Hooker and Haynes had left Massachusetts in 1636 and 1637 for new settlements on the [[Connecticut River]] (the nucleus of the [[Connecticut Colony]]);&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 300–302&lt;/ref&gt; Vane left for England after the 1637 election, suggesting that he might seek a commission as a governor general to overturn the colonial government.&lt;ref&gt;Winship, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  (Vane never returned to the colony, and became an important figure in Parliament before and during the [[English Civil War]]s; he was beheaded after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].)&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 321–333&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the 1637 election, the general court passed new rules on residency in the colony, forbidding anyone from housing newcomers for more than three weeks without approval from the magistrates.  Winthrop vigorously defended this rule against protests, arguing that Massachusetts was within its rights to "refuse to receive such whose dispositions suit not with ours".&lt;ref name=B294&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;  Ironically, some of those who protested the policy had been in favor of banishing Roger Williams in 1635.&lt;ref name=B294/&gt;  Winthrop was then out of office, and he had a good relationship with Williams. The magistrates ordered Williams' arrest, but Winthrop warned him, making possible his flight which resulted in the establishment of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence Plantation]].&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Providence Plantation later united with the settlements on Rhode Island (now called Aquidneck Island) to create the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Winthrop and Williams later had an epistolary relationship in which they discussed their religious differences.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian policy===
Winthrop's attitude toward the local Indian populations was generally one of civility and diplomacy.  He described an early meeting with one local chief:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Chickatabot]] came with his [chiefs] and squaws, and presented the governor with a hogshead of Indian corn. After they had all dined, and had each a small cup of sack and beer, and the men tobacco, he sent away all his men and women (though the governor would have stayed them in regard of the rain and thunder.) Himself and one squaw and one [chief] stayed all night; and being in English clothes, the governor set him at his own table, where he behaved himself as soberly ... as an Englishman. The next day after dinner he returned home, the governor giving him cheese, and [[pea]]se, and a mug, and other small things.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The colonists generally sought to acquire title to the lands that they occupied in the early years,&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; although they also practiced a policy that historian Alfred Cave calls ''[[vacuum domicilium]]'': if land is not under some sort of active use, it is free for the taking.  This meant that lands could be claimed which were only used seasonally by the Indians (e.g., for fishing or hunting) and were empty otherwise.  According to Alfred Cave, Winthrop claimed that the rights of "more advanced" peoples superseded the rights of the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Cave, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

However, cultural differences and trade issues between the colonists and the Indians meant that clashes were inevitable, and the [[Pequot War]] was the first major conflict in which the colony engaged.  Winthrop sat on the council which decided to send an expedition under John Endecott to raid Indian villages on [[Block Island]] in the war's first major action.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Winthrop's communication with Williams encouraged Williams to convince the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansetts]] to side with the English against the Pequots, who were their traditional enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;  The war ended in 1637 with the destruction of the Pequots as a tribe, whose survivors were scattered into other tribes or shipped to the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery and the slave trade===
Slavery already existed in the Massachusetts Bay area prior to John Winthrop's arrival, since [[Samuel Maverick (colonist)|Samuel Maverick]] arrived in the area with slaves in 1624.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  In the aftermath of the Pequot War, many of the captured Pequots warriors were shipped to the West Indies as slaves.  Winthrop kept one male and two female Pequots as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Manegold (January 18, 2010), ''New England's scarlet 'S' for slavery''; Manegold (2010), ''Ten Hills Farm: The Forgotten History of Slavery in the North'', 41–42 Harper (2003), ''Slavery in Massachusetts''; Bremer (2003), p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1641, the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was enacted, codifying rules about slavery, among many other things.  Winthrop was a member of the committee which drafted the code, but his exact role is not known because records of the committee have not survived.  C.S. Manegold claims that Winthrop was opposed to the Body of Liberties because he favored a common law approach to legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Manegold (January 18, 2010), ''New England's scarlet 'S' for slavery''; Manegold (2010), ''Ten Hills Farm: The Forgotten History of Slavery in the North'', 41–42 Harper (2003), ''Slavery in Massachusetts''; Bremer (2003), pp. 304, 305, 314&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade and diplomacy===
Rising tensions in England culminated in [[English Civil War|civil war]] and led to a significant reduction in the number of people and provisions arriving in the colonies.  The colonists consequently began to expand trade and interaction with other colonies, non-English as well as English. This led to trading ventures with other Puritans on [[Barbados]], a source of [[cotton]], and with the neighboring French colony of [[Acadia]].&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

French Acadia covered the eastern half of present-day Maine, as well as [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. It was embroiled in [[Acadian Civil War|a minor civil war]] between competing administrators; English colonists began trading with [[Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour]] in 1642, and his opponent [[Charles de Menou d'Aulnay]] warned Boston traders away from la Tour's territories.  In June 1643, la Tour came to Boston and requested military assistance against assaults by d'Aulnay.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor Winthrop refused to provide official assistance, but allowed la Tour to recruit volunteers from the colony for service.&lt;ref name=B344&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision brought on a storm of criticism, principally from the magistrates of [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]], which was geographically closest to the ongoing dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;  John Endecott was particularly critical, noting that Winthrop had given the French a chance to see the colonial defenses.&lt;ref name=B344/&gt;  The 1644 election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy, and he was turned out of office.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;  The Acadian dispute was eventually resolved with d'Aulnay as the victor.  In 1646, Winthrop was again in the governor's seat when d'Aulnay appeared in Boston and demanded reparations for damage done by the English volunteers.  Winthrop placated the French governor with the gift of a [[sedan chair]], originally given to him by an English privateer.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 347&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property and family===
[[Image:FortWinthrop.png|thumb|right|The 19th century [[Fort Winthrop]], constructed on [[Governors Island (Massachusetts)|Governors Island]] and formerly owned by Winthrop]]
In addition to his responsibilities in the colonial government, Winthrop was a significant property owner.  He owned the Ten Hills Farm, as well as land that became the town of Billerica, [[Governors Island (Massachusetts)|Governors Island]] in Boston Harbor (now the site of [[Logan International Airport]]), and [[Prudence Island]] in [[Narragansett Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 264–265&lt;/ref&gt;  He also engaged in the [[fur trade]] in partnership with [[William Pynchon]], using the ship ''Blessing of the Bay''.&lt;ref name=B252_3&gt;Bremer (2003), pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt;  Governors Island was named for him and remained in the Winthrop family until 1808, when it was purchased for the construction of [[Fort Winthrop]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanhope and Bacon, pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

The farm at Ten Hills suffered from poor oversight on Winthrop's part. The steward of the farm made questionable financial deals that caused a cash crisis for Winthrop.  The colony insisted on paying him his salary (which he had refused to accept in the past) as well as his expenses while engaged in official duties.  Private subscriptions to support him raised about £500 and the colony also granted his wife {{convert|3,000|acre|km2}} of land.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife Margaret arrived on the second voyage of the ''Lyon'' in 1631, but their baby daughter Anne died during the crossing. Two more children were born to the Winthrops in New England before Margaret died on 14 June 1647.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 2039&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Winthrop married his fourth wife Martha Rainsborough some time after 20 December 1647 and before the birth of their only child in 1648. She was the widow of Thomas Coytmore and sister of [[Thomas Rainsborough|Thomas]] and [[William Rainborowe]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 2040&lt;/ref&gt;  Winthrop died of natural causes on 26 March 1649, and is buried in what is now called the [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]] in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;  He was survived by his wife Martha and five sons.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 271–272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings and legacy==
Winthrop rarely published and his literary contribution was relatively unappreciated during his time, yet he spent his life continually producing written accounts of historical events and religious manifestations.  His major contributions to the literary world were ''A Modell of Christian Charity'' (1630) and ''The History of New England'' (1630–1649, also known as ''The Journal of John Winthrop''), which remained unpublished until the late 18th century.

===''A Model of Christian Charity''===
{{main|Model of Christian Charity}}
John Winthrop wrote and delivered the lay sermon that became ''A Model of Christian Charity'' either before the 1630 crossing to North America or while en route.&lt;ref name=B174/&gt;  It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, as well as the struggles that they would have to overcome in the New World.  He used the phrase "city upon a hill" (derived from the [[Bible]]'s [[Sermon on the Mount]])&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 5:13: "You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden."&lt;/ref&gt; to characterize the colonists' endeavour as part of a special pact with God to create a holy community.&lt;ref&gt;Findling and Thackeray, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  He encouraged the colonists to "bear one another's burdens" and to view themselves as a "Company of Christ, bound together by Love."&lt;ref name=Dunn11&gt;Dunn, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  He told the colonists to be stricter in their religious conformance than even the Church of England, and to make it their objective to establish a model state.  If they did so, God would "make us a prayse and glory, that man shall say of succeeding plantacions: the lord make it like that of New England."&lt;ref name=Dunn11/&gt;

Winthrop's sermon is often characterized as a forerunner to the concept of [[American exceptionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Pease, p. 76 and Hodgson, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent research has shown, however, that the speech was not given much attention at the time of its delivery, unlike the farewell sermon of [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]].&lt;ref name=B174&gt;Bremer (2003), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Winthrop did not introduce any significant new concepts, but merely repeated what were widely held Puritan beliefs.  The work was not published until the nineteenth century, although it was known and circulated in manuscript before that time.&lt;ref name=JW151&gt;Jehlen and Warner, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The History of New England''===
Winthrop kept a journal of his life and experiences, starting with the voyage across the Atlantic and continuing through his time in Massachusetts, originally written in three notebooks. His account has been acknowledged as the "central source for the history of Massachusetts in the 1630s and 1640s".&lt;ref name=Winthropxi&gt;Winthrop et al, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two notebooks were published in 1790 by [[Noah Webster]].  The third notebook was long thought lost but was rediscovered in 1816, and the complete journals were published in 1825 and 1826 by [[James Savage (banker)|James Savage]] as ''The History of New England from 1630–1649. By John Winthrop, Esq. First Governor of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay. From his Original Manuscripts''.  The second notebook was destroyed in a fire at Savage's office in 1825; the other two volumes now belong to the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop et al, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard Dunn and Laetitia Yeandle produced a modern transcription of the diaries in 1996, combining new analysis of the surviving volumes and Savage's transcription of the second notebook.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop et al&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal began as a nearly day-to-day recounting of the ocean crossing.  As time progressed, he made entries less frequently and wrote at a greater length so that, by the 1640s, the work began to take the shape of a history.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop et al, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;  Winthrop wrote primarily of his private accounts: his journey from England, the arrival of his wife and children to the colony in 1631, and the birth of his son in 1632. He also wrote profound insights into the nature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and nearly all important events of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Winthrop|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;display-query=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Reference&amp;limiter=&amp;u=georgetown_dhs&amp;currPage=&amp;disableHighlighting=true&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;source=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;action=e&amp;catId=GALE%7CDPZJVZ793683095&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CK1631007034|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of his early journal entries were not intended to be literary, but merely observations of early New England life.  Gradually, the focus of his writings shifted from his personal observations to broader spiritual ideologies and behind-the-scenes views of political matters.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop et al, p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
Winthrop's earliest publication was likely ''The Humble Request of His Majesties Loyal Subjects'' (London, 1630), which defended the emigrants' physical separation from England and reaffirmed their loyalty to the Crown and Church of England. This work was republished by [[Joshua Scottow]] in the 1696 compilation ''MASSACHUSETTS: or The first Planters of New-England,  The End and Manner of their coming thither, and Abode there: In several EPISTLES''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/scottow/7/|title=Massachusetts: or The First Planters of New-England, The End and Manner of Their Coming Thither, and Abode There: In Several Epistles (1696)|accessdate=2011-01-21|publisher=University of Nebraska, Lincoln}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his more famous works, Winthrop produced a number of writings, both published and unpublished. While living in England, he articulated his belief "in the validity of experience" in a private religious journal known as his ''Experiencia''.&lt;ref name=Bremer1984&gt;Bremer (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote in this journal intermittently between 1607 and 1637 as a sort of confessional, very different in tone and style from the ''Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop et al, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in his life, he wrote ''A Short Story of the rise, reign, and ruine of the Antinomians, Familists and Libertines, that Infected the Churches of New England'' which described the Antinomian controversy surrounding Anne Hutchinson and other in 1636 and 1637. The work was first published in London in 1644.&lt;ref&gt;Schweninger, pp. 47–66&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its publication, there was much discussion about the nature of church governance, and the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]] had recently begun to meet.  The evidence which it presented was seen by supporters of Congregationalism as proving the book's worth, and by opponents as proving its failings.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;  In some of its editions, it was adapted by opponents of Henry Vane, who had become a leading [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] political leader in the discussion. Vane's opponents sought to "tie Toleration round the neck of Independency, stuff the two struggling monsters into one sack, and sink them to the bottom of the sea."&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

According to biographer Francis Bremer, Winthrop's writings echoed those of other Puritans which "were efforts both to discern the divine pattern in events and to justify the role [which] New Englanders believed themselves called to play."&lt;ref name=Bremer1984/&gt;

===Legacy===
[[Image:John Winthrop Tomb Boston.jpg|thumb|right|Winthrop's tomb in [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]]]]
Winthrop's reference to the "city upon a hill" in ''A Modell of Christian Charity'' has become an enduring symbol in American political discourse.&lt;ref name=Bxv/&gt;  Many American politicians have cited him in their writings or speeches, going back to revolutionary times.  Winthrop's reputation suffered in the late 19th and early 20th century, when critics pointed out the negative aspects of Puritan rule, including [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], and leading to modern assessments of him as a "lost Founding Father". Political scientist Matthew Holland argues that Winthrop "is at once a significant founding father of America's best and worst impulses", with his calls for charity and public participation offset by what Holland views as rigid intolerance, exclusionism, and judgmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Winthrop gave a speech to the General Court in July 1645, stating that there are two kinds of liberty: natural liberty to do as one wished, "evil as well as good," a liberty that he believed should be restrained; and civil liberty to do good. Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was "the proper end and object of authority", meaning that it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Winthrop|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;display-query=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Reference&amp;limiter=&amp;u=georgetown_dhs&amp;currPage=&amp;disableHighlighting=true&amp;displayGro|website=Biography in context|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported this point of view by his actions, such as when he passed laws requiring the heads of households to make sure that their children and servants received proper education, and for support of teachers from public funds.&lt;ref name="Winthrop, John"/&gt; Winthrop's actions were for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was more crucial of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn't be split by any force, such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson.&lt;ref name="Winthrop, John"/&gt; He was a leader respected by many, even Richard Dummer, a principal Hutchinsonian disarmed for his activities, who gave 100 pounds to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Charles|title=Winthrop, John|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/01/01-00995.html?a=1&amp;n=john%20winthrop&amp;d=10&amp;ss=1&amp;q=5|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=American National Biography Online|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern politicians refer to Winthrop's writings in their speeches, people as diverse as [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Michael Dukakis]], and [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref name=Bxv&gt;Bremer (2003), p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Ronald Reagan described Winthrop as "an early 'Freedom Man'" who came to America "looking for a home that would be free."&lt;ref name=Mos7&gt;Moseley, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Winthrop is a major character in [[Catharine Maria Sedgwick]]'s 1827 novel ''[[Hope Leslie]]'', set in colonial Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Sedgwick&lt;/ref&gt; He also makes a brief appearance in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' in the chapter entitled "The Minister's Vigil."&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne&lt;/ref&gt;

John Winthrop's descendants number thousands today.  His son John was the first governor of the [[Saybrook Colony]], and later generations of his family continued to play an active role in New England politics well into the 19th century.  Twentieth century descendants include former US Senator from Massachusetts and former Secretary of State [[John Kerry]], and educator [[Charles William Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanancestors.org/governor-thomas-dudley/|title=Notable Descendants of Governor Thomas Dudley|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|accessdate=2011-01-25|last=Roberts|first=Gary Boyd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The towns of [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]] and [[Winthrop, Maine]] are named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/Pages/WinthropMA_About/about |title=About Winthrop, Massachusetts |publisher=Town of Winthrop |accessdate=2011-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224152640/http://www.town.winthrop.ma.us/Pages/WinthropMA_About/about |archivedate=24 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard and Crocker, p. 2:72&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winthrop House]] at [[Harvard University]] and Winthrop Hall at [[Bowdoin College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/images/lunagallery/winthropluna.shtml|title=Winthrop Hall – Library – Bowdoin College|accessdate=2014-01-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113184155/http://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/images/lunagallery/winthropluna.shtml|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; are named in honor of him and of his descendant [[John Winthrop (educator)|John Winthrop]], who briefly served as [[President of Harvard University|President of Harvard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winthrophouse.net/node/25|title=History of Winthrop House|publisher=Winthrop House|accessdate=2011-02-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124211331/http://www.winthrophouse.net/node/25|archivedate=24 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also the namesake of squares in Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The [[Winthrop Building]] on Water Street in Boston was built on the site of one of his homes and is one of the city's first skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=BOS.2111|title=Massachusetts Cultural Resource Inventory: Winthrop Building|accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Ortega y Gasset''' ({{IPA-es|xoˈse oɾˈteɣa i ɣaˈset|lang}}; 9 May 1883&amp;nbsp;– 18 October 1955) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[philosophy|philosopher]], and essayist. He worked during the first half of the 20th century, while Spain oscillated between [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|monarchy]], [[Second Spanish Republic|republicanism]], and [[Spanish Civil War|dictatorship]]. His [[philosophy]] has been characterized as a "[[philosophy of life]]" that "comprised a long-hidden beginning in a [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[metaphysics]] inspired by [[William James]], and with a general [[Methodology|method]] from a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] imitating [[Edmund Husserl]], which served both his proto-[[existentialism]] (prior to [[Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger's]])&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; and his realist [[historicism]], which has been compared to both [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Benedetto Croce]]."&lt;ref&gt;John T. Graham. ''A Pragmatist Philosophy of Life in Ortega y Gasset''. (University of Missouri Press, 1994), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
José Ortega y Gasset was born 9 May 1883 in [[Madrid]]. His father was director of the newspaper ''El Imparcial'', which belonged to the family of his mother, Dolores Gasset. The family was definitively of Spain's end-of-the-century liberal and educated bourgeoisie. The liberal tradition and journalistic engagement of his family had a profound influence in Ortega y Gasset's activism in politics.

Ortega was first schooled by the [[Jesuit]] priests of San Estanislao in [[Miraflores del Palo]], [[Málaga]] (1891–1897). He attended the [[University of Deusto]], [[Bilbao]] (1897–98) and the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the Central University of Madrid (now [[Complutense University of Madrid]]) (1898–1904), receiving a doctorate in Philosophy. From 1905 to 1907, he continued his studies in [[Germany]] at [[Leipzig]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Cologne]], [[Berlin]] and, above all [[Marburg]]. At Marburg, he was influenced by the [[neo-Kantianism]] of [[Hermann Cohen]] and [[Paul Natorp]], among others.

On his return to Spain in 1908, he was appointed professor of [[Psychology]], [[Logic]] and [[Ethics]] at the Escuela Superior del Magisterio de Madrid&lt;ref name="ortegaygasset.edu"&gt;[http://www.ortegaygasset.edu/contenidos.asp?id_i=27 ''Datos biográficos'']&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 1910 he was named full professor of [[Metaphysics]] at Complutense University of Madrid, a vacant seat previously held by [[Nicolás Salmerón]].

In 1917 he became a contributor to the newspaper ''[[El Sol (Madrid)|El Sol]]'', where he published, as a series of essays, his two principal works: ''España invertebrada'' (''[[Invertebrate Spain]]'') and ''La rebelión de las masas'' (''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]''). The latter made him internationally famous. He founded the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Revista de Occidente|es}}'' in 1923, remaining its director until 1936. This publication promoted translation of (and commentary upon) the most important figures and tendencies in philosophy, including [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Johan Huizinga]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Georg Simmel]], [[Jakob von Uexküll]], [[Heinz Heimsoeth]], [[Franz Brentano]], [[Hans Driesch]], [[Ernst Müller]], [[Alexander Pfänder]], and [[Bertrand Russell]].

Elected deputy for the [[Province of León]] in the constituent assembly of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], he was the leader of a parliamentary group of intellectuals known as ''Agrupación al Servicio de la República''&lt;ref&gt;Encarta Encyclopedia Spanish Version: Agrupación_al_Servicio_de_la_República Microsoft Corporation Spanish Version [http://es.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_1121500589/Agrupaci%C3%B3n_al_Servicio_de_la_Rep%C3%BAblica.html].

Leaving Spain at the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], he spent years of exile in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] until moving back to [[Europe]] in 1942.&lt;ref name="ortegaygasset.edu"/&gt; He settled in [[Portugal]] by mid-1945 and slowly began to make short visits to Spain. In 1948 he returned to Madrid, where he founded the Institute of Humanities, at which he lectured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophers/jose-ortega-y-gasset.php Philosophy Professor: Jose Ortega Y Gasset] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916073527/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophers/jose-ortega-y-gasset.php |date=16 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to Spain, he often privately expressed his hostility to the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime, stating that the government did not deserve anyone's confidence and that his beliefs were "incompatible with Franco."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dobson |first1=Andrew |title=An Introduction to the Politics and Philosophy of José Ortega Y Gasset |date=Nov 19, 2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Liberalism sidebar}}

===Liberalism===
''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' is Ortega's best known work. In this book he defends the values of meritocratic liberalism reminiscent of [[John Stuart Mill]] against attacks from both communists and right-wing populists.&lt;ref name="Dobson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dobson |first1=Andrew |title=An Introduction to the Politics and Philosophy of José Ortega Y Gasset |date=Nov 19, 2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=60–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortega likewise shares Mill's fears of the "tyranny of the majority" and the "collective mediocrity" of the masses which threaten individuality, free thought, and protections for minorities.&lt;ref name="Dobson" /&gt; Ortega characterized liberalism as a politics of "magnanimity."&lt;ref name="Dobson" /&gt;

Ortega's rejection of the Spanish [[Conservative Party (Spain)|Conservative Party]] under [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]] and his successors was unequivocal, as was his distrust of the Spanish monarchy and Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Dobson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Enkvist |first1=Inger |title=José Ortega y Gasset - The Spanish philosopher who saw life as an intellectual adventure |journal=CFE Working Paper Series |date=2002 |volume=18 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, again in a manner similar to Mill, Ortega was open-minded toward certain socialists and non-Marxist forms of socialism, and even complimented [[Pablo Iglesias Posse]] as a "lay saint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dobson |first1=Andrew |title=An Introduction to the Politics and Philosophy of José Ortega Y Gasset |date=Nov 19, 2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of German social democrats such as [[Paul Natorp]] and [[Hermann Cohen]], he adopted a [[communitarian]] ontology and could be critical of capitalism, particularly the [[laissez-faire]] variant, declaring that "nineteenth-century capitalism has demoralized humanity" and that it had "impoverished the ethical consciousness of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dobson |first1=Andrew |title=An Introduction to the Politics and Philosophy of José Ortega Y Gasset |date=Nov 19, 2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=52–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia"===
For Ortega y Gasset, philosophy has a critical duty to lay siege to beliefs in order to promote new ideas and to explain reality. To accomplish such tasks, the philosopher must—as Husserl proposed—leave behind prejudices and previously existing beliefs, and investigate the essential reality of the universe. Ortega y Gasset proposes that philosophy must overcome the limitations of both [[idealism]] (in which reality centers around the ego) and ancient-medieval [[Philosophical realism|realism]] (in which reality is outside the subject) to focus on the only truthful reality: "my life"—the life of each individual. He suggests that there is no 'me' without things, and things are nothing without me: "I" (human being) cannot be detached from "my circumstance" (world). This led Ortega y Gasset to pronounce his famous maxim "''Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia''" ("I am I and my circumstance") (''Meditaciones del Quijote'', 1914)&lt;ref&gt;Ortega y Gasset, José. Obras Completas, Vol. I. Ed. Taurus/Fundación José Ortega y Gasset, Madrid, 2004, p. 757.&lt;/ref&gt; which he always put at the core of his philosophy.

For Ortega y Gasset, as for Husserl, the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] '[[cogito ergo sum]]' is insufficient to explain reality. Therefore, the Spanish philosopher proposes a system wherein the basic or "radical" reality is "my life" (the first ''yo''), which consists of "I" (the second ''yo'') and "my circumstance" (''mi circunstancia''). This ''circunstancia'' is oppressive; therefore, there is a continual dialectical interaction between the person and his or her circumstances and, as a result, life is a drama that exists between necessity and freedom.

In this sense Ortega y Gasset wrote that life is at the same time fate and freedom, and that freedom "is being free inside of a given fate. Fate gives us an inexorable repertory of determinate possibilities, that is, it gives us different destinies. We accept fate and within it we choose one destiny." In this tied down fate we must therefore be active, decide and create a "project of life"—thus not be like those who live a conventional life of customs and given structures who prefer an unconcerned and imperturbable life because they are afraid of the duty of choosing a project.

===''Raciovitalismo''===
With a philosophical system that centered around life, Ortega y Gasset also stepped out of [[Descartes]]' ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' and asserted "I live therefore I think". This stood at the root of his [[Kantian]]-inspired [[perspectivism]],&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; which he developed by adding a non-relativistic character in which absolute truth does exist and would be obtained by the sum of all perspectives of all lives, since for each human being life takes a concrete form and life itself is a true radical reality from which any philosophical system must derive. In this sense, Ortega coined the terms "[[razón vital]]" ("vital reason" or "reason with life as its foundation") to refer to a new type of reason that constantly defends the life from which it has surged and "raciovitalismo", a theory that based knowledge in the radical reality of life, one of whose essential components is reason itself. This system of thought, which he introduces in ''History as System'', escaped from Nietzsche's vitalism in which life responded to impulses; for Ortega, reason is crucial to create and develop the above-mentioned project of life.

===Historical reason===
For Ortega y Gasset, vital reason is also "historical reason", for individuals and societies are not detached from their past. In order to understand a reality we must understand, as [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]] pointed out, its history. In Ortega's words, humans have "no nature, but history" and reason should not focus on what ''is'' (static) but what ''becomes'' (dynamic).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Influence==
Ortega y Gasset's influence was considerable, not only because many sympathized with his philosophical writings, but also because those writings did not require that the reader be well-versed in technical philosophy.

Among those strongly influenced by Ortega y Gasset were [[Luis Buñuel]], {{ill|Manuel García Morente|es}}, {{ill|Joaquín Xirau|es}}, [[Xavier Zubiri]], [[Ignacio Ellacuría]], [[Milan Komar|Emilio Komar]], [[José Gaos]], [[Luis Recasens]], {{ill|Manuel Granell|es}}, [[Francisco Ayala (novelist)|Francisco Ayala]], [[María Zambrano]], {{ill|Agustín Basave (writer)|es|Agustín Basave Fernández del Valle|lt=Agustín Basave}}, [[Máximo Etchecopar]], [[Pedro Laín Entralgo]], {{ill|José Luis López-Aranguren|es}}, [[Julián Marías]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], {{ill|Paulino Garagorri|es}}, [[Olavo de Carvalho]], [[Vilém Flusser]] and [[Félix Martí-Ibáñez]].

The [[Ortega hypothesis]], based on a quote in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'', states that average or mediocre scientists contribute substantially to the advancement of [[science]].

German grape breeder Hans Breider named the grape variety [[Ortega (grape)|Ortega]] in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wein-plus.eu/en/Ortega_3.0.1714.html Wein-Plus Glossar: Ortega], accessed 6 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The American philosopher [[Graham Harman]] has recognized Ortega y Gasset as a source of inspiration for his own [[object-oriented ontology]].

''La rebelión de las masas'' (''The Revolt of the Masses'') has been translated into English twice. The first, in 1932, is by a translator who wanted to remain anonymous,&lt;ref&gt;José Ortega y Gasset (1930/1950), ''The Revolt of the Masses'', reprint, New York:  New American Library, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; generally accepted to be J.R. Carey.&lt;ref&gt;as referenced by the Project Gutenberg eBook of U.S. Copyright Renewals, 1960 January – June.&lt;/ref&gt;
The second translation was published by the [[University of Notre Dame Press]] in 1985, in association with [[W.W. Norton]] &amp; Co. This translation was by Anthony Kerrigan (translator) and Kenneth Moore (editor), with an introduction by [[Saul Bellow]].

[[Mildred Adams]] is the translator (into English) of the main body of Ortega's work, including ''Invertebrate Spain'', ''Man and Crisis'', ''What is Philosophy?'', ''Some Lessons in Metaphysics'', ''The Idea of Principle in Leibniz and the Evolution of Deductive Theory'', and ''An Interpretation of Universal History''.

===Influence on the Generation of '27===
Ortega y Gasset had considerable influence on writers of the [[Generation of '27]], a group of poets that arose in Spanish literature in the 1920s.

{{infobox person/Wikidata | fetchwikidata=ALL | onlysourced=yes|works=''La Trahison des Clercs''}}
'''Julien Benda''' (26 December 1867 &amp;ndash; 7 June 1956) was a French [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[novelist]]. He remains famous for his short book, ''La Trahison des Clercs'' (''The Treason of the Intellectuals'' or ''The Betrayal of the Intellectuals''). He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] four times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=12051 |title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one time for the Goncourt Prize.

== Life ==
Born into a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Paris]], Benda became a master of French ''[[belles-lettres]]''. Yet he believed that science was superior to literature as a method of inquiry. He disagreed with [[Henri Bergson]], the leading light of French philosophy of his day.

Benda is now best remembered for his short 1927 book ''La Trahison des Clercs'', a work of considerable influence. It was translated into English in 1928 by [[Richard Aldington]]; the U.S. edition had the title ''The Treason of the Intellectuals'', while the British edition had the title ''The Great Betrayal.'' It was republished in 2006 as ''The Treason of the Intellectuals'' with a new introduction by [[Roger Kimball]]. This polemical essay argued that European [[intellectual]]s in the 19th and 20th century had often lost the ability to reason dispassionately about political and military matters, instead becoming apologists for crass nationalism, warmongering and racism. Benda reserved his harshest criticisms for his fellow Frenchmen [[Charles Maurras]] and [[Maurice Barrès]]. Benda defended the measured and dispassionate outlook of [[classical civilization]], and the internationalism of traditional [[Christianity]].

Closing this work, Benda darkly predicts that the augmentation of the "realistic" impulse to domination of the material world justified by intellectuals into an "integral realism" risked producing an all-encompassing species-civilization which completely ceased "to situate the good outside the real world". Human aspirations, specifically after power, would become the sole end of society. In closing, bitterly, he concludes: "And History will smile to think that this is the species for which Socrates and Jesus Christ died."&lt;ref&gt;Benda, Julien (1956). "The Treason of the Intellectuals". W. W. Norton and Co. pp. 202–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works by Benda include ''Belphégor'' (1918), ''Uriel's Report'' (1926), and ''Exercises of a Man Buried Alive'' (1947), an attack on the contemporary French celebrities of his time. Most of the titles in the bibliography below were published during the last three decades of Benda's long life; he is emphatically a 20th-century author. Moreover, Benda survived the German occupation of France, 1940–1944, and the [[Vichy regime]] despite being a Jew and having called the Germans "one of the plagues of the world".

He died in [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]].

[[File:Szabo Lajos.JPG|thumb|Lajos Szabó]]
'''Lajos Szabó''' (* 1 July 1902 in [[Budapest]] † 21 October 1967 in Düsseldorf) was a Hungarian philosopher and one of the founders of the ''[[Budapest School of the Philosophy of Dialogue]]''.

==Early life==

Lajos Szabó was born in Budapest on 1 July 1902. In 1919 he was dismissed from vocational secondary school due to his sympathies with the Hungarian Soviet Republic. At the beginning of the 1920s, he took part in the illegal Communist movement for a few months.

==A Self-Taught Philosopher==

In the first half of the 1920s, Lajos Szabó worked in Vienna and Budapest as a bookshop-assistant. Between 1928 and 1930 he became a member of the "work circle" of [[Lajos Kassák]]. He wrote two articles for the journal Munka. It was at this time that he got acquainted with [[Karl Korsch]]. Together with several other members of the Munkakör (Movement of Work), Lajos Szabó was expelled from this communist organisation. The secessionists called themselves the Hungarian movement of the opposition. This leftist, anti-capitalist and, at the same time, anti-Bolshevik social movement was also connected to the uncompromising Marxism of [[Karl Korsch]]

==Cooperation with Béla Tábor==

In 1930 Lajos Szabó got to know Béla Tábor with whom he had a close work relationship until the end of his life. Between 1931 and 1932, Lajos Szabó spent some months in Berlin and Frankfurt. He studied at the [[Institute for Social Research]] and in 1933 and 1934 he went on study tours to Vienna and to Paris.

He wrote ''Vádirat a szellem ellen'' (The Indictment of the Spirit) in 1936 together with Béla Tábor. In 1937 ''A hit logikája – Teocentrikus logika'' (The Logic of Faith: A Theocentric Logic) was published. The second part of this work was published only long after his death. Lajos Szabó wrote a number of studies that were published only after his death: ''Megjegyzések a marxizmus kritikájához'' [Remarks on the Critique of Marxism], ''A tudományos szocializmus bírálatához'' [A Contribution to the Critique of Scientific Socialism], ''A mammonizmus természetrajzához'' [On the Nature of Mammonism], ''Adalékok a halmazelmélet kérdéseihez'' [Contributions to the Theory of Sets], Nietzsche). 

A very important study by Lajos Szabó is ''Biblia és romantika'' (The Bible and Romanticism) which was written based on a lecture he gave in 1941.

In 1938 he married Magda Pallós who died in 1946. In 1940 he was called up for labour service, but a few weeks later he was dismissed from the army due to his tuberculosis. He was hospitalised at the New St John's Hospital in Budakeszi. His close friend [[Lajos Vajda]] was treated at the same hospital ward. In the spring of 1944 Szabó was deported to Auschwitz. He survived and returned home to Hungary at the end of 1945.

==The Budapest School of the Philosophy of Dialogue==

Lajos Szabó and Béla Tábor laid the foundations of the Budapest School of the Philosophy of the Dialogue in the post-war years. During these years they cooperated closely with [[Béla Hamvas]], a writer and essayist and also with [[Lajos Fülep]], an art historian. Lajos Szabó, Béla Tábor and Béla Hamvas came together regularly to discuss problems of philosophy and art theory, and their "intellectual community" came to be known as the "Thursday Talks".  Stefánia Mándy, the wife of Béla Tábor and Katalin Kemény the wife of Béla Hamvas also took part in these conversations.

Lajos Szabó published two writings in 1946:  Irodalom és rémület (Literature and Fright) ''Diárium''  and Művészet és vallás (Art and Religion) in ''Mouseion''. Between 1946 and 1948 he delivered lectures to young intellectuals. His talks included detailed value theoretical and value psychological analyses. In these lectures Lajos Szabó strove at a synthesis of the pre-philosophical situation (e.g. Indian tradition and the pre-Socratic philosophers) with the post-philosophical approach, i.e. the critique
of philosophy, religion and art which is to be found in the works of the great figures of the 19th century, such as [[Søren Aabye Kierkegaard]], [[Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]). 

Lajos Szabó's thinking is closely related to the achievements of the philosophy of the dialogue as represented by [[Ferdinand Ebner]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]] and [[Martin Buber]], and he called himself also a "language philosopher". At the beginning of his lectures on value theory he pointed out that he identifies himself primarily with the Biblicism of Ferdinand Ebner, because he regards this approach basically unassailable, well-founded and as the one that goes furthest, although he believed that in important respects—primarily with regard to the evaluation of mathematics and art-- Biblicism has to be re-examined and also criticised.

The most active participants of the seminar lectures were [[Attila Kotányi]] and [[György Kunszt]] who also made written records of the lectures. The lectures covered the following topics: psychology, value and sign theory, economics, existentialism, the Indian traditions, theory of sets, the concept of language maths and prismatism. The printed version of these lectures could be published only after 1990, long after Szabó´s death.
 
Lajos Szabó participated actively in the activities of  the Európai Iskola (European School), which was a neo-avantgarde group of visual artists and writers. From 1949 on, in the period of Stalinist dictatorship in Hungary, close relationships emerged between the then underground movement of the Budapest School of the Philosophy of the Dialogue and the banned avantgarde visual artists, especially those who were members of the European School.

From the mid-1950s on, Lajos Szabó started to draw calligraphies. The year 1954 saw the creation of the first calligraphies which can be regarded to be "meditations expressed through drawings".  After 1956 he left Hungary with his wife. He stayed in Vienna till the end of 1957 following which, till the end of 1961, he lived in Brussels.  In 1960 Lajos Szabó travelled around West Germany, and his calligraphies were exhibited in Munich, Dortmund, Hamburg and Hagen. In 1962 he moved to Düsseldorf. In 1966 he had an exhibition in Paris. Lajos Szabó adopted the pseudonym "AO". On the one hand, this can be regarded as an ancronym formed from the adjective "anti-organisational", on the other hand, A and O were the vowels contained in his first and last names. For a period of time, he signed the calligraphies with "AO". Later, however, AO got transformed into a visual motif.

Lajos Szabó died on 21 October 1967 in Düsseldorf. His grave is in the Jewish cemetery of the town.

==Lajos Szabó, the philosopher==

Although the knowledge of Marxism and its ways of thinking were indeed present in Lajos Szabó's thinking, his main sources were existentialist thinkers in particular the twentieth-century philosophy of the dialogue represented by [[Franz Rosenzweig]] and, above all, [[Ferdinand Ebner]] (Das Wort and die geistigen Realitäten). 

These are the most important topics in the writings of Lajos Szabó:
*An emphasis was placed on the organic unity of the European tradition as a whole, including the arts, science, philosophy and religion.

* The unity of language and thinking and the methodological use of this conviction were emphasized.

* Based on the above and also on an anti-materialist and anti-Marxist theory of values, all value-creating processes (including the production of material goods) were attributed to 'research'. 
 
*Research in this broad sense was considered to be a fundamental human activity. It was believed to include not only scientific research but also all types of arts and all human acts that indeed bring something new into the world, evidently not out of thin air, but inspired by cultural, linguistic and philosophical traditions.

His most-cited work, written together with his close associate, Béla Tábor, is ''Vádirat a szellem ellen'' (Indictment of the Spirit)&lt;ref&gt; Vádirat a szellem ellen – with Béla Tábor, Az Idő könyvei, 1936; 2nd edition, Veszprém Comitatus, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; consists of three parts.

This book takes the whole of intellectual life to account: "Someone should at last undertake performing the embarrassing task, and pull off the veil of innocence from the only factor which has remained intact so far in a world splintered along conflicting interests and characterised by the ''bellum omnium contra omnes'', the spirit. (…) We are aware that when we undertake revealing intellectual life we become traitors to the class of intelligentsia. The «creative intelligentsia» seems to have had a very good time in the position which it occupied in the invisible hierarchy of society. It was the social class which could accuse without being accused, which could pass judgements without being judged.  (…) This is an elegant and risk-free position to take. Nations fought terrible battles, millions died and the spirit could be the accuser: come and behold the work of politicians! Masses live in abject poverty, classes lose the ground below their feet, the mechanism of production bogs down, and the spirit can assume the role of the accuser: come and behold the social structure! Terrible epidemics decimate whole peoples and sordid sins are revealed, and the spirit can become the accuser again: come and see today's health-care! And what if we also mentioned all the depraved standards of morality! And all the accusations brought up by the intelligentsia are accompanied by a gestures of being ignored: if only the spirit could assume power…!"&lt;ref&gt; Ibid. pp. 5–6 &lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the Indictment of the Spirit deals with the ongoing fragmentation of the spirit, which can be primarily seen in the arts and humanities. In this process language as a rational means of dialogue is ruined. The spirit renounces its leadership role, and pursues modest goals. This crisis can only be overcome if everyone who devotes their energies to researching a problem considers all the other proposed solutions to the problem as a personal challenge  as a personal question addressed to them. The representatives of the spirit have to be aware of their own character traits, and also know, that in addition to influencing the masses, they themselves should learn from them.

The second part of this work deals with the practice and the theory of the spirit.  The authors point out that the spirit has retreated into the theory, accepting at the same time the fact that practice has subjugated theory.

The third part of the book deals with the "geography of the spirit" The problem of Marxism, the authors point out, is that the objective of this movement, i.e. the creation of a new  man, is not compatible with the dictatorial means whereby this objective is to be achieved. 
The authors, followers of the philosophy of the dialogue, assert that the main cause of the crisis is the helplessness of the spirit.

In his review, [[Béla Hamvas]] pointed out that this book should be regarded an anthropological study. He finishes his evaluation with the following words: "The real history of man is man's history of becoming godlike (…) Being a man means to have a fate, in which, in spite of errors and mistakes, there is always an opportunity for becoming godlike." &lt;ref&gt; Béla Hamvas: Anklage gegen den Geist In: Eikon: Die spekulativen Bildschriften von Lajos Szabó, Budapest, Ernst Múzeum, 1997, p. 73. &lt;/ref&gt; This book review by Béla Hamvas, which at the time of its writing the publisher refused to publish because he thought the reviewer gave this work too much recognition, finishes with the highly topical, indeed poetic statement: "Life becomes more and more difficult for man, because he knows more and more. And he who knows a lot, and does not live accordingly, points out Jan van Ruysbroek, is lost once and for all." &lt;ref&gt; Ibid, p. 72 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Lajos Szabó, the calligrapher==



In the last stage of Szabó's life, a speculative graphic art played an important role. "Szabó's genre within graphic art ist the abstract calligraphy (…) When calligraphy is substituted by abstract calligraphy, this means that the letters are substituted by signs and by the image. A religious person must have a great deal of courage to make this step towards abstraction. Lajos Szabó came to the recognition that signs, inspired by letters  and replacing them, are the direct manifestations of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lajosszabo.com/SZL/Uri_Asaf_Sz_L_kiallitas_megnyito.pdf|website=lajosszabo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lajos Szabó created his first calligraphies in 1954. "The abstract line of the emerging works  »is not the abstraction of something«. It is not the abstract reflection of something concrete in reality, but it is rather the primary  reality. It is the sign, the reflection and the breakthrough of the growing soul, it is »non-representational« in a way defined by Malewitsch. It is an inventive, internal spiritual reality. The carrier of this reality is just the line. The manifestations of the line are the traces that the  pencil or the pen leave on a sheet of paper.

[[File:Ausstellung, 1962, Hagen, Germany.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Exhibition invitation card, 1962, Hagen, Germany ]]

A meaningful number of calligraphies originating from the period preceding the end of 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2018-03-31|title=Lajos Szabó|url=http://lajosszabokalligraphien5556.hu/en_US/|website=lajosszabokalligraphien5556.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; was exhibited in 1980 in the Budapest Club of Young Artists. (The curators of the exhibition were Dániel Bíró and Botond Kocsis.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lajosszabo.com/SZL/1980_FMK.pdf|website=lajosszabo.com|title=Lajos Szabo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1957 Lajos Szabó's works were exhibited together with the works of Lajos Vajda, Endre Bálint, Attila Kotányi und Lyubomir  Szabó in the Brussels Palais Des Beaux Arts. 

Lajos Szabó's calligraphies are preserved in a number of non-Hungarian museums: Musée Royal, Brussels; Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen Rotterdam; Museum Kunstpalast, Düsseldorf; Staatliche Kunstsammlung Stuttgart; Sammlung Haubrich im Museum Ludwig Köln; Städtisches Kunstmuseum, Duisburg; Stiftung Lehmbruch Museum-Zentrum Internationalen Skulptur, Duisburg; Kunstmuseum Bochum Kunstsammlung.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19448">A list of works by [[Lucian of Samosata]] (c. AD 125 – after AD 180), who wrote in [[Ancient Greek]].

The order of the works is that of the [[Oxford Classical Texts]] edition. The English titles are taken from [[Loeb Classical Library|Loeb]] (alternative translations are sometimes given in brackets). The traditional Latin titles have also been given.

Some of the works are probably not by Lucian. Those whose attribution is almost certainly wrong are listed at the end. Other works whose authenticity is disputed are marked "[?]". Four works whose genuineness was once questioned but are now generally believed to be by Lucian are marked with an asterisk.&lt;ref&gt;See Sidwell pp. xiv–xv&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and lexicology ==
The XIV Congress of the [[International Naturist Federation]] ([[Cap d'Agde|Agde]], [[France]], 1974) defined naturism as:

: ''a way of life in [[harmony]] with [[nature]] characterised by the practice of [[#Social_nudism|communal nudity]] with the intention of encouraging [[self-respect]], respect for others and for the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deschênes|first1=Stéphane|title=The Official INF-FNI Definition of Naturism|url=http://www.inf-fni.org/content/download/28259/1110928/file/Official%20INF-FNI%20Definition%20Of%20Naturism.pdf|website=INF-FNI|publisher=International Naturist Federation|accessdate=11 January 2016|format=PDF|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''
Several other terms ("social nudity", "[[public nudity]]", "[[skinny dipping]]", "sunning", and "clothes-free") have been proposed as alternative terms for naturism, but none has found the same widespread public acceptance as the older terms "naturism" and (in much of the United States) "nudism".

People interested in social nudity can attend [[nude beach|clothes-free beaches]] and other types of ad-hoc nudist events. At these venues, participants generally need not belong to a [[nudist club]].

Many contemporary naturists and naturist organisations feel that the practice of social nudity should be asexual. For various social, cultural, and historical reasons the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations often oversimplify the relationship between naturism and sexuality. Current research has begun to explore this complex relationship.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

The International Naturist Federation explains:

: '' "Each country has its own kind of naturism, and even each club has its own special character, for we too, human beings, have each our own character which is reflected in our surroundings."''{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}}{{efn|The Hannover based ''Bund für freies Lebensgestaltung'' wrote "Naturism is a new lifestyle caring for the body, the soul and the spirit in society. We live the ideal of freedom, conscious of its limits, taking up our responsibility. The expression of our will is nudity, our admission of sincerity.}}

The usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically.{{efn|In his book, ''Cinema Au Naturel'',{{sfn|Storey|2003|p=11}} author [[Mark Storey]] states "two related terms that we will continually run across are ''nudist'' and ''naturist''. Although, the meanings of the two terms are virtually identical, they often have different connotations for those who prefer one to the other. In America people who believe that it is physically, socially, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually healthy to go about fully nude individually and in groups of mixed sex whenever weather permits and others are not offended generally refer to themselves as "nudists". In Europe such people more often than not refer to themselves as "naturists".}} Though in the United States, naturism and nudism have the same meaning,{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} in Britain there is a clear distinction.{{efn|The English version of the Agde definition was translated differently in ''Guide Mondial de Naturisme 96 97''.{{sfn|Anon|1997|p=}} ''Naturism (American "nudism") is a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of communal nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and the environment.''}}

Nudism is the ''act of being naked'', while naturism is a ''lifestyle'' which at various times embraced nature, environment, respect for others, self-respect, crafts, healthy eating, vegetarianism, teetotalism, non-smoking, yoga, physical exercise and pacifism as well as nudity.{{efn|Ray Connett, Sunny Trails, in Sunbathing for Health Sept 1947 p 8, July 1957 p 14 writes that Naturism is a weasel word that can mean anything}}{{efn|Presently, [[Mark Storey]] is authoring an article detailing historical use of the terms naturism and nudism and how they differ between different cultures, countries, and time periods in history. In a telephone interview by Daniel Johnson on 15 April 2006 with Storey he stated that "a draft of the piece was posted on the "References" page of [[The Naturist Society]] [http://naturistsociety.com/ web site] for a few weeks". At the time of its former release in October 2004 it was titled ''Naturism, Nudism, or Nameless? A History of Terms'' He is planning on publishing a revised article as soon as additional information and errors are corrected.}}

In naturist parlance, ''[[wikt:textile|textile]]'' or ''textilist'' is a non-naturist person, non-naturist behaviour or non-naturist facilities. e.g. ''the textile beach starts at the flag'', ''they are a mixed couple&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; he is naturist, she is textile''.  ''Textile'' is the predominant term used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] ('textilist' is unknown in British naturist magazines including ''[[H&amp;E naturist]]''), although some naturists avoid it due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations.  ''Textilist'' is said to be used interchangeably, but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for ''textile''.{{sfn|Mars-Jones|1991|p=152}} ''Clothing optional'' and ''nude optional'' (US specific) describe a policy or a venue that allows or encourages nudity but tolerates the wearing of clothes. The opposite is ''clothing compulsory''; that is, prohibiting nudity. Adjectival phrases ''clothes free'' and ''clothing free'' prescribe where naturism is permitted in an otherwise textile environment, or define the preferred state of a naturist.

The social nudity movement includes a large range of variants including "naturism", "nudism", "[[Freikörperkultur]] (FKK)", the "[[nude beach|free beach]] movement" as well as generalized "public lands/[[public nudity]]" advocacy. There is a large amount of shared history and common themes, issues and philosophy, but differences between these separate movements remain contentious.

==Personal and family nudity==
[[File:Carl Larsson Model writing postcards 1906.jpg|thumb|right|Personal nudity: [[Carl Larsson]], ''Model Writing Postcards'', watercolor, 1906]]

{{Main|Nudity#Private nudity}}
Many people are often nude in the privacy of their home or garden, either alone or with members of the family; naturists normally refer to them as at-home-nudists or closet-nudists. This may be occasional nudity or as a naturist lifestyle. There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children, and whether children should be nude within the home in the view of their family as well as visitors. This has attracted a great deal of academic study.

A United States study by [[Alfred Kinsey]] (1948&amp;ndash;1953) found that 75% of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up, 5% of the participants said that there was "seldom" nudity in the home, 3% said "often", and 17% said that it was "usual". The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home.{{sfn|Bancroft|2003|p=}}

&lt;!-- Do not remove these images, Wikipedia is not censored and the current consensus is for this article to have images --&gt;
Gordon and Schroeder in 1995 reported that parental nudity varies considerably from family to family. They say that "there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They note that by ages 5 to 6 children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommend to parents who wish to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they limit such activities from that age onwards.{{sfn|Gordon &amp; Schroeder|1995|p=16}}

Barbara Bonner in 1999 cautioned against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic.{{sfn|Bonner|2000|p=209-}}

In a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect.{{sfn|Okami|1995}} Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.{{sfn|Okami et al|1998}}

Smith and Sparks in their study on the effects of social nudity on children conclude that "the viewing of the unclothed body, far from being destructive to the psyche, seems to be either benign and totally harmless or to actually provide positive benefits to the individuals involved.{{sfn|Smith|Sparks|1986|p=183}}

== Social nudism ==
{{See also|Exhibitionism}}

The rhetoric of the nudism and anti-nudism movements emphasizes freedom from many of the normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more significant main effects for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with [[High- and low-context cultures|Hall's high-low context distinction]] and the [[Robert T. Francoeur|Francoeur]]'s hot-cool sexuality continuum.{{sfn|Smith|1980}}

=== Naturist facilities ===

At naturist organised events or venues clothing is usually optional, except by swimming pools or sunbathing lawns where complete nudity is expected, weather permitting. This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among some naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}

Facilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members' naturist club is one that owns its own facilities, while non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, and rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

[[File:Outdoor bathing at Jhiben Hot Spring 20121110.jpg|thumb|Families bathing nude at a hot spring in Taiwan]] &lt;!-- Can we crop this to remove triangle --&gt;

Some clubs have stricter entrance requirements than some traditional 'country clubs', including the requirement to supply references, a sponsoring member, a trial membership, committee approval or, criminal background checks. UK clubs are now required to have child-protection policies in place, and designated child-protection officers. Many clubs promote frequent social activities.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs.{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}} [[Nudist colony]] is no longer a favored term, but it is used by naturists as a term of derision for landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria, and in meta-data on naturist websites.

A holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. The center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] card, that is, be a member of their national organization, but some have relaxed this restriction, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers can be quite small, just a couple of hectares or large occupying over 300 hectares.{{efn|The three biggest centres on the [[Médoc]] are Euronat 335 ha, CHM 175 ha with a 3 km beach, and La Jenny 127 ha}} In a large holiday centre there will be swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families will visit each year.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}}

A naturist resort is, to a European, an essentially urban development where naturism is the norm. [[Cap d'Agde]] in France, naturist village [[Charco del Palo]] on Lanzarote, Canary Islands, [[Vera, Spain|Vera Playa]] in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Vera Playa history article|url=http://www.veraplaya.info/history.html|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vritomartis{{sfn|Schneider|2009|p=41}} in Greece are examples. Some residents use these resorts as a year-round home.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In US usage, a naturist resort can mean a holiday centre.&lt;ref name="PalmSprings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |title=For a relaxed explanation |publisher=Sunnyfun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308025528/http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freikörperkultur]] (FKK) literally translated as 'free body culture' is the name for the general movement in [[Germany]]. The abbreviation is widely recognised all over Europe and often found on informal signs indicating the direction to a remote naturist beach.

=== Nude beaches ===
[[File:Chihuahua20 01 2007 2.jpg|thumb|A sign at a nude beach in Maldonado, Uruguay]]

Clothing is optional at [[nude beach]]es (or "free beaches"). A feature of bathing on a nude beach is the anonymity it offers, with membership of a club not being required, nor detailed application processes, nor pre-booking of visits.{{Original research inline|date=September 2014}}{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Naturism and sports ===
{{see also|Nude recreation|Nudity in sport}}

Naturism encourages a healthy life style, and many naturist clubs at times organize and encourage members to take part in local and international sport events and competitions. The [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|German Association for Free Body Culture (DFK)]]  promotes recreational sports and is a member of the [[German Olympic Sport Federation]] ([[DOSB]]).

=== Festival naturism ===
[[File:People pix in the village.jpg|thumb|Naturist couple at the [[Nambassa]] festival, New Zealand, 1981]]

From [[Woodstock]] to [[Edinburgh Festival|Edinburgh]], and [[Nambassa]] in the southern hemisphere communal nudity is commonly recorded at music and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] festivals.

The series of 1970s [[Nambassa]] [[hippie]] festivals held in New Zealand is a further example of non-sexualized naturism. Of the 75,000 patrons who attended the 1979 Nambassa 3 day [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] Festival an estimated 35% of festival attendees spontaneously chose to remove their clothing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nambassa.com/johnlowe.html |title=Public nudity at Nambassa |publisher=Nambassa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring complete or partial nudity.{{sfn|Jones &amp; Broadley|1979|p=}}'

[[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde festival]] in Denmark hosts a naked run, that has become one of the most popular events there.

Perhaps nowadays the biggest and most famous festival where participants spontaneously decide to go naked or take part in nude events is [[Burning Man]]: it's got its own naked bike ride aka 'Naked Pub Crawl', and a few camps organize activities in the nude, including the famous&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/naked-restaurant-paris-park-bunyadi-nude-cruise-nudist-resort-hotel-greece-pictures-a7346721.html|title=Naked ambition: 5 ways to holiday in the nude|date=2016-10-05|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; oil wrestling by camp [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://activenaturists.net/gymnasium-camp/|title=Gymnasium theme camp|date=2015-11-07|work=Active Naturists|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summer naturism===
The prevalence of naturism tends to increase during the summer months especially when the temperature is higher with some regions experiencing first-time naturists and people who have transitioned to becoming a naturist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLellan | first1 = Josie | year = 2007 | title = State socialist bodies: East German nudism from ban to boom | url = | journal = The Journal of Modern History | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 48–79 | doi=10.1086/517544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have observed that among some of these naturists, they are clothed during other seasons, thus making them seasonal naturists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Casler | first1 = Lawrence | year = 1964 | title = Some sociopsychological observations in a nudist camp: A preliminary study | url = | journal = The Journal of social psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 307–323 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919569}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quiddity has caught the public perception and comprehension of public nudity, and thus it is frequently equated with summer destinations such as beaches.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Storm.

== History ==
{{Main|History of nudity|l1=Nudity in History}}
{{see also|Timeline of non-sexual social nudity}}
Nudity in social contexts has been practised in various forms by many [[culture]]s at all time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/how-it-used-to-be/ |title=nudity as a social norm |publisher=active naturists |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western society nowadays, social nudity is most frequently encountered in the contexts of [[bathing]], swimming and in [[sauna]]s, whether in single-sex groups, within the family or with mixed-sex friends, but throughout history and in many tropical cultures until now, nudity is a norm at many sports events and competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/nudity-ok2/ |title=naked sport events throughout history |publisher=active naturists |date=2012-08-30 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to nominate exactly when naturism started as a movement. The word 'naturism' was used for the first time in 1778 by a French-speaking Belgian, Jean Baptiste Luc Planchon (1734–1781), and was advocated as a means of improving the ''hygiène de vie'' or healthy living.{{efn|"Le naturisme est la doctrine qui consiste à laisser agir la nature plutot que d'intervenir de manière artificielle".&lt;ref name="Planchon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Planchon|first=Jean Baptiste Luc |title=La naturisme, ou La nature considérée dans les maladies &amp; leur traitement conforme à la doctrine &amp; à la pratique d'Hippocrate et de ses sectateurs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3ZEAAAAcAAJ|year=1778|publisher=Varlé}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest known naturist club in the "western" sense of the word was established in British [[India]] in 1891. The 'Fellowship of the Naked Trust' was founded by Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, a widower, who was a [[District Courts of India|District and Sessions Judge]] for the [[Bombay]] [[Indian Civil Service|Civil Service]]. The commune was based in [[Matheran]] and had just three members at the beginning; Crawford and two sons of an [[Anglican]] missionary, Andrew and Kellogg Calderwood.{{efn|Crawford wrote a series of letters discussing his new club and its philosophy to the socialist [[Edward Carpenter]] between 1891 and 1892. In his letters to Carpenter, Crawford described his daily activities.

: "Calderwood and I were up at Matheran having two days’ holiday to spend naked from breakfast to evening [...] in June, Calderwood and I had a grand day. We went away to a bungalow in the [[Tulsi Lake]] without servants and spent from dinner time Saturday till 5 pm Sunday in nature’s garb".

The club's dress code required full nudity, with exceptions made for accessories such as rings and glasses. Members of the club had to be plainspoken about sexual related matters and all [[taboo]]s were consciously discarded. Carpenter suggested that a female branch should be added to the commune, although this was not achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/cover-story/Worlds-first-nudist-colony-was-in-Thane-and-this-man-proved-it/articleshow/16011435.cms|title=World's first nudist colony was in Thane (and this man proved it)|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The commune fell apart when Crawford was transferred to [[Ratnagiri]]; he died soon after in 1894.{{sfn|Farrar|2005}}

[[File:Koch, Max (1854-1925) - 1897 - Freilicht - vmp 01.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Max Koch]]'s ''Freilicht'', 1897]]

In 1902, a series of philosophical papers was published in [[Germany]] by Dr. [[Heinrich Pudor]], under the pseudonym Heinrich Scham, who coined the term ''Nacktkultur''. In 1906 he went on to write a three volume treatise with his new term as its title, which discussed the benefits of nudity in co-education and advocated participating in sports while being free of cumbersome clothing.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}} [[Richard Ungewitter]] (''Nacktheit'', 1906, ''Nackt'', 1908, etc.) proposed that combining physical fitness, sunlight, and fresh air bathing, and then adding the nudist philosophy, contributed to mental and psychological fitness, good health, and an improved moral-life view.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}} Major promoters of these ideas included [[Adolf Koch]] and [[Hans Suren]]. Germany published the first journal of nudism between 1902 and 1932.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=}}

The wide publication of those papers and others, contributed to an explosive worldwide growth of nudism, in which nudists participated in various social, recreational, and physical fitness activities in the nude. The first organized club for nudists on a large scale, ''Freilichtpark'' (Free-Light Park), was opened near [[Hamburg]] in 1903 by Paul Zimmerman.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}}
In 1919, German doctor [[Kurt Huldschinsky]] discovered that exposure to sunlight helped to cure [[rickets]] in many children, causing sunlight to be associated with improved health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26935867 10 inventions that owe their success to World War One]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France in the early 20th century, the brothers [[Gaston Durville|Gaston]] and [[André Durville]], both of them physicians, studied the effects of psychology, nutrition, and environment on health and healing. They became convinced of the importance of natural foods and the natural environment on human well-being and health. They named this concept {{lang-fr|naturisme}}. The profound effect of clean air and sunlight on human bodies became evident to them and so nudity became a part of their naturism.

Naturism became a more widespread phenomenon in the 1920s, in [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and other European countries and spread to the [[United States]] where it became established in the 1930s.

By 1951, the national federations united to form the [[International Naturist Federation]] or [[International Naturist Federation|INF]].{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} Some naturists preferred not to join clubs, and after 1945, pressure was put to designate beaches for naturist use.
From the middle of the 20th century, with changing leisure patterns, commercial organisations began opening holiday resorts to attract naturists who expected the same&amp;nbsp;– or better&amp;nbsp;– standards of comfort and amenity offered to non-naturists.  More recently, naturist holiday options have expanded to include cruises.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}}

== Philosophy ==
[[File:Badstuga, efter illustration i Acerbis Travels, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|''Finnish Sauna'' (1802)]]
Naturism had many different philosophical sources and means many things to different people.&lt;ref name="Carter2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Michael|title=J.C.

In 1974, the INF defined naturism as:

:: ''a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of social nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and for the environment.&lt;ref name="Definition" /&gt;

At one end of the spectrum are the nudists who just enjoy a nude life style, and at the other are the naturists, who have deeply held beliefs and see communal nudity as just one of many important principles.

The naturist philosophy has several sources, many of which can be traced back to early 20th century health and fitness philosophies in [[Germany]] and [[England]], although the concepts of returning to nature and creating equality have much deeper roots.

&lt;!-- moved from lead- needs integrating From Germany the idea spread to the rest of Europe and [[North America]] and beyond where a network of clubs developed. The model of [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|German naturism]]  is to promote naturist family and recreational sports, with the [[DFK|German Association for Free Body Culture (DFK)]] being a member of the [[German Olympic Sport Federation]] ([[DOSB]]). [[France|French]] naturism developed on the basis of large [[vacation (travel)|holiday]] complexes. This in turn influenced [[Quebec]] and the United States. A subsequent development was [[tourism|tourist]] naturism, where nudist resorts would be built to cater for the nudist tourist, without any local base. This concept is most noticeable in the [[Caribbean]]. Nevertheless, most naturist activity takes place at local naturist clubs, especially in Western countries. --&gt;

=== Gymnosophy and religious nakedness ===
{{see also|Gymnosophist|American Gymnosophical Association}}

In the 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] encountered, in India, wandering groups of naked holy men whom he dubbed the ''naked philosophers''. (''Gr ''gymnos'': naked; ''sophist'': knowledge''). The philosopher [[Onesicritus]] investigated their beliefs and lifestyle. [[Pyrrho]] the [[Sceptic]] was impressed and incorporated nudity into his philosophy. The Gymnosophists were [[Hindu]]s, but [[Jain]] and [[Ajivika]] monks [[Nudity in religion|practiced nudity as a statement]] that they had given up all worldly goods. Nudity was not a new concept to the Greeks as the [[Olympic Games]] (founded in 776 BC) were exclusively male and nude events. 

Historically, the [[Adamites]], a [[Gnostic]] sect, practiced [[Nudity in religion|religious nudism]].
A religious sect in Canada that immigrated from Russia, the [[Sons of Freedom (political group)|Sons of Freedom]], went so far in the 1900s (1903-1950s) as to publicly strip in mass public demonstrations to protest against government policies which were meant to assimilate them.&lt;ref&gt;* Jim Hamm Productions Limited ''Spirit Wrestlers'', a 2002 documentary video and DVD about the Russian Christian sect called Freedomite Doukhobors,&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Christian naturism]] contains various members associated with most [[Christian denomination|denominations]].  Although beliefs vary, a common theme is that much of Christianity has misinterpreted the events regarding the [[Garden of Eden]], and God was displeased with [[Adam and Eve]] for covering their bodies with [[fig leaf|fig leaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figleafforum.com/resources_genesis.html |title="What Do The First Three Chapters Of Genesis Teach About Clothing?" by Ian B. Johnson, Fig Leaf Forum (note: articles such as this one are peer reviewed) |publisher=Figleafforum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English naturists adopted the name Gymnosophy as a thinly disguised euphemism for their pastime. The [[English Gymnosophical Society]] was formed in 1922 and became the [[New Gymnosophy Society]] in 1926; they purchased land at 'Bricketts Wood' to become Britain's first [[nudist colony]]. One of the first members was [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who in 1945 established the 'Five Acres Club' nearby, ostensibly as a nudist club, but as a front for [[Wicca]]ns, as [[witchcraft]] was illegal in England until 1951.

The [[Digambar]], one of the two main divisions of the [[Jainism|Jain]] religion of India, remain [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]], or naked, though generally it is practiced by males.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Digambar means 'clothed with the sky'. [[Wicca]]ns have adopted this wording and some practice their rituals skyclad.

=== Naturist writers ===
* [[Elton Raymond Shaw]] was a [[Methodist]] churchman and publisher who wrote on the Body Taboo.
* [[Heinrich Pudor]] wrote on methods to improve social hygiene in his book ''Nackende Menschen und Jauchzen der Zukunft'' (Naked people and the future of Mankind) and then ''[[Nacktkultur]]'' (Nude Culture). It prescribes an austere lifestyle and nudity.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Paul Zimmermann|Paul Zimmermann]] opened the Freilicht Park in Lübeck which was open to those who subscribed to Nacktkultur principles.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[Richard Ungewitter]] wrote ''Die Nacktheit'' (Nakedness) which sold 90,000 copies, prescribed a similar Utopian lifestyle, where everyone would be nude, eat only vegetables and abstain from alcohol and tobacco. In his Utopia, everyone was to be Germanic with blue eyes and blonde hair.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Adolf Koch|Adolf Koch]], a left-wing primary-school teacher, sought to use social nudity to free the people from 'authority fixated conditioning which held proletarians in deference of their masters: parental authority, paternalism of the church, the mass media and organs of law and order. He used Organic-Rhythmic exercises in Berlin schools in the 1920s. In 1932 there were about 100,000 Germans involved with Naturism, of which 70,000 were in Koch's ''Körperschülen'' schools.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Hans Suren|Hans Surén]] taught nude gymnastics to soldiers for five years, and on being forced to leave the army, he wrote in 1924, ''Mensch und die Sonne'' (Men and the Sun) which ran to 61 reprints.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}} Later, in 1936, Surén proposed physical exercise and naturism as a means of creating a pure German race and of beauty. In the early 1940s he was out of favour and arrested. By 1945, he had turned full circle and was writing religious texts. Though never a member of any FKK club he was awarded honorary membership of the [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|DFK]] in 1952.
* [[:de:Werner Zimmermann|Werner Zimmermann]] was Swiss. He promoted [[Progressive education]], encouraging naked [[Physical education]] to eliminate body guilt and to encourage openness that would lift the repression of the human spirit, which he saw as the cause of sexual deviation. The basic position was that the human body, in and of itself, was neither sinful nor obscene. This was adopted into the emerging philosophy that created the modern Western nudist movement.

=== Naturist ideals ===
[[File:Nude people at Praia do Abricó.jpg|right|thumb|Family in Praia do Abricó, [[Brazil]]]]

Individuals have formed naturist groups for a variety of specific purposes.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} It is generally agreed by naturist organisations that [[eroticism]] and blatant sexuality have no place in naturism and are, in fact, antithetical to its ideals. Reasons that have at times been given:

* [[ecology|Ecological]] or [[environmentalist|environmental]]&amp;nbsp;— rapport with the natural world.
* [[Health]]&amp;nbsp;— bathing in the sun, fresh air and water ([[balneotherapy]], [[thalassotherapy]], [[heliotherapy]]). Sun is a form of medicine.
* [[Healthy diet|Diet]]&amp;nbsp;— Naturism has at times been associated with claims made for moderation with [[alcohol]], [[meat]], [[tobacco]], [[drug]]s; leading to a [[teetotal]], [[vegetarian]] or [[vegan]] lifestyle.
* [[Nude psychotherapy|Psychologically]] — rapport with other humans including equality and respect. Being nude in groups makes all feel more accepted&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; physically, intellectually and emotionally.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;
* [[Spirituality]]&amp;nbsp;— nudity, well being and direct contact to nature helps feel closer to the universe.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Pedagogy]]&amp;nbsp;— children should be respected as equals instead of being patronised{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Social equality|Equality]]&amp;nbsp;— clothes build social barriers. Social nudity leads to acceptance in spite of differences in age, body shape, fitness, and health.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Discussed in:{{Citation | last = Veltheim| first = Andrew| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Naturism: Naked Beneath Your Clothing| year = | url = http://www.parama.com/html/naturism.html| accessdate =2012-04-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408070907/http://www.parama.com/html/body_naturism.html |archivedate=2010-04-08 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Liberty]]&amp;nbsp;— no one has the right to tell others or their children that they must wear clothes.

=== Naturism and the romantics ===
[[Walt Whitman]] American writer, A Sun-bathed Nakedness:

{{quote|Never before did I get so close to Nature; never before did she come so close to me... Nature was naked, and I was also... Sweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature! - ah if poor, sick, prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more! Is not nakedness indecent? No, not inherently. It is your thought, your sophistication, your fear, your respectability, that is indecent. There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear, but are themselves indecent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nakedness and Nature|url=http://www.naturistplace.com/nudity19.htm|website=Naturist Place|date=8 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Henry David Thoreau]], ''In wildness is the preservation of the world.'', [[Walking (Thoreau)|Walking]]:

{{quote|We cannot adequately appreciate this aspect of nature if we approach it with any taint of human pretense. It will elude us if we allow artifacts like clothing to intervene between ourselves and this Other. To apprehend it, we cannot be naked enough.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;}}

Naturism was part of a literary movement in the late 1800s (see the writings of [[André Gide]]) which also influenced the art movements of the time specifically [[Henri Matisse]] and other [[Fauvism|Fauve]] painters. This movement was based on the French concept of ''[[joie de vivre]]'', the idea of reveling freely in physical sensations and direct experiences and a spontaneous approach to life.{{sfn|Harrison &amp; Perry|1993|p=}}

=== Naturism for health ===
[[Sunlight]] has been shown to be beneficial in some skin conditions and enables the body to make [[vitamin D]],&lt;ref name=bupa2004&gt;{{Citation| last =BUPA's Health Information Team| first =| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title =Hot topic – Vitamin D, sunlight and cancer| date =24 March 2004| url =http://www.bupa.co.uk/health_information/html/health_news/261103vitd.html| accessdate =2007-12-02| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070203050901/http://www.bupa.co.uk/health_information/html/health_news/261103vitd.html| archivedate =3 February 2007| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with the increased awareness of [[skin cancer]], wearing of [[sunscreen]] is now part of the culture.&lt;ref name=bupa2004/&gt; Sun exposure prompts the body to produce [[nitric oxide]] that helps support the cardiovascular system and the feelgood brain-chemical [[serotonin]].&lt;ref name="LindqvistEpstein2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindqvist|first1=P.

===World Naked Bike Ride===
[[File:Naked Bike Ride - Holborn - 12 June 2016.JPG|thumb|WNBR passing [[Holborn tube station|Holborn underground station]] 11 June 2016]]
The [[World Naked Bike Ride]] (WNBR) is an international [[clothing-optional bike ride]] and exercise in [[public nudity]], that has developed outside the organised naturism movement. Participants plan, meet and ride together ''en masse'' on [[human-powered transport]] (the vast majority on [[bicycle]]s, but some on [[skateboard]]s and [[inline skates]]), to "deliver a vision of a cleaner, safer, body-positive world."&lt;ref name="WNBRwebsite"&gt;[http://worldnakedbikeride.org Official WNBR global web site] circa June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The WNBR shares some aspects of the philosophy of naturism in that it promotes a return to healthy exercise in unpolluted air at the same time promoting positive body image.

== Demographics ==
* In 1999, the [[Federation of Canadian Naturists]] commissioned a national survey on Canadian attitudes towards nudity&lt;ref name=fcnstat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/survey-on-naturism-in-canada |title=1999 National Survey on Canadian Attitudes Towards Nudity |year=1999 |work=Federation of Canadian Naturists |publisher=Federation of Canadian Naturists |location=Ontario, Canada |accessdate=2011-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003072728/http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/survey-on-naturism-in-canada |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which found that 8.9% of Canadian have visited or would visit a naturist facility. A further 11.6% have gone or would go skinny dipping in mixed company; that 39% go naked in their own homes; that naturists tend to have above average incomes; that urban dwellers are more likely to be naturist than country dwellers; and that the under 25s are the most likely to be naturists.
* In 1983, the Naturist Society in the United States sponsored a Gallup poll, which was repeated in 2000,{{sfn|Anderson |2000}} which found the following:

&lt;!-- Needs to be rewritten and sourced.
=== Croatia ===
Croatia has been an attractive naturist destination for five decades. Today there are more than 30 official naturist campsites, tourist villages, hotels, apartments, beaches and numerous more unofficial naturist bathing places.
Naturism is well accepted all along Croatian Adriatic coast. There are official naturist beaches which are sometimes within all naturist resorts and campings and sometimes there are special areas in textile resorts assigned for naturists. Often entrance is charged.
Then there are so called free beaches which are known to be naturist for many years, but not officially. Those places are mostly clothing optional.
And finally there are wild beaches where one can freely choose to be bare or to keep swimming suit on.
Naturist beaches are marked with signs saying "FKK" for "Freikörperkultur," German for Free Body Culture. Unofficial beaches are sometimes called free beaches. Croatia's naturist facilities often focus on different visitor categories, including families, adults, gays, and those where everyone is welcome. Beaches also often are sectioned into these categories.
Many naturist beaches (official or not) are within walking distance from centers of towns, villages or resorts. Many of the regular beaches have also a naturist section, usually at the end of the beach.
Croatia has long been popular for bare-all beach holidays, especially with German and Dutch nudists. Koversada, an island linked by bridge to the Istrian mainland, is the oldest among 30 official naturist resorts. All are indicated by "FKK" signs but there are also scores of unofficial strips.{{cn|date=November 2013}} --&gt;{{main|List of social nudity places in Europe}}

=== Finland ===
In [[Finnish culture]], nudism is considered to be a relatively normal way to live. It is not uncommon to see entire families spending time together naked. Families may be naked while bathing in a sauna, swimming in a pool, or playing on a beach, and it's not unusual to see children playing naked in a kindergarten or family yard for example. Nudity as a whole is considered less taboo than many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mapes, Terri. [http://goscandinavia.about.com/od/finland/qt/nudism_finland.htm "Nudism in Finland"]. ''about travel''.

{{main|Naturism in France}}

In 1903 la ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'' published a report on [[Freikörperkultur|German naturism]] and S. Gay created a naturist community at Bois-Fourgon. In 1907, supported by his superiors, Abbé Legrée encouraged the students at his Catholic college to bathe nude on the rocky beaches near [[Marseille]].

[[File:CapdAgde crop.jpg|thumb|right|Sign at [[Cap d'Agde]] mentioning that it is obligatory to be nude at this beach]]

Marcel Kienné de Mongeot is credited with starting naturism in France in 1920. His family had suffered from tuberculosis, and he saw naturism as a cure and a continuation of the traditions of the ancient Greeks. In 1926, he started the magazine ''Vivre intégralement'' (later called ''Vivre'') and the first French naturist club, ''Sparta Club'' at Garambouville, near [[Evreux]].  The court action that he initiated, established that nudism was legal on private property that was fenced and screened.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

[[File:Nude hiking in Gard.jpg|thumb|left|Randonue in [[Les Concluses]], [[Gard]], 2008]]

Drs. André and Gaston Durville bought a 70 hectare site on the [[Île du Levant]] where they established the village of [[Île du Levant|Héliopolis]]. The village was open to the public. In 1925 Dr François Fougerat de David de Lastours wrote a thesis on [[heliotherapy]]. and in that year opened the ''Club gymnique de France''.  In 1936, the naturist movement was officially recognised.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

Albert and Christine Lecocq were active members of many of these clubs, but after disagreements left and In 1944 Albert and Christine Lecocq founded the ''Club du Soleil'' with members in 84 cities. In 1948 they founded the [[:fr:Féderation Française de Naturisme|FFN]], in 1949 they started the magazine, ''Vie au Soleil'' and in 1950 opened the [[CHM Montalivet]], the world's first naturist holiday centre where the [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] was formed.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

The naturist village [[Leucate]] and [[Cap d'Agde]] offers a different form of social nudity. [[Euronat (naturist resort)|Euronat]] is the largest holiday centre (335ha) situated 10&amp;nbsp;km north of Montalivet. Naturism employs more than 3000 people, and is estimated to be worth 250 million Euro to the French economy.&lt;!-- ref needed --&gt; France is represented on the [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] by the [[:fr:Féderation Française de Naturisme|FFN]].

{{See also|Freikörperkultur}}
German naturism was part of the [[Lebensreform]] movement and the [[Wandervogel]] youth movement of 1896, from [[Steglitz]], [[Berlin]] which promoted ideas of fitness and vigour. At the same time doctors of the [[:de:Naturheilbewegung|Natural Healing Movement]] were using [[heliotherapy]], treating diseases such as [[Tuberculosis|TB]], [[rheumatism]] and [[scrofula]] with exposure to sunlight.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}

[[File:Naked woman in inner city 3.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[nude]] woman moves in a busy market in Germany, while other people carry on with their routine activities, 2005.]]

Nacktkultur, a term coined in 1903 by [[Heinrich Pudor]], flourished.{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=}}  Nacktkultur connected nudity, vegetarianism and social reform. It was practised in a network of 200 members clubs. The movement gained prominence in the 1920s as offering a health giving life-style with Utopian ideals. Germany published the first naturist journal between 1902 and 1932.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=}}
It became politicised by radical socialists who believed it would lead to classlessness and a breaking down of society. It became associated with [[pacificism]].{{sfn|Hau|2003|p=}}

In 1926, [[Adolf Koch]] established a school of naturism in Berlin; encouraging a mixing of the sexes, open air exercises, and a programme of "sexual hygiene". In 1929, the Berlin school hosted the first International Congress on Nudity.{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0905-402, Ostsee, Sonnenbad.jpg|thumb|left|Young East German women at a naturist beach in 1988]]

During the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' era, all naturist clubs had to register with the ''Reichsbund für Leibesübungen'', which meant excluding [[Judaism|Jews]] and [[Communism|Communists]]. Also, they had to keep all activities hidden in the countryside where there was little chance of being seen by others. The status as a West German ''sports federation'' member gave the clubs rights and privileges (e.g. tax exemptions) so the naturist clubs remained in the federation after the war had ended.

After the war, [[East Germany|East Germans]] were free to practice naturism, chiefly at beaches rather than clubs (private organizations being regarded as potentially subversive).

=== Poland ===
First reported naturist society was established in 1897 in [[Grudziądz]]. In pre-war and post-war [[Poland]], naturism was practised in closed and secluded areas. Reported places for naturism were [[Zaleszczyki]] (in today's [[Ukraine]]) and [[Otwock]]. Under the [[communist|communism]] regime, Poland's naturism became unofficial and was practiced mostly by the artistic boheme near [[Krynica Morska]], [[Misdroy]] and Dębki.

In the early 1980s naturism became popular mostly due to increased interest in [[News media|media]]. As the [[pop music|pop]] song "Chałupy Welcome To" (about the naturist beach in Chałupy, featuring beach nudity in the clip) became the 1985 [[summer hit]] in Poland, the nude seaside locations like [[Chałupy]] or [[Rowy, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Rowy]] became known to an average Polish sunbather. Polish Naturist Society was formed and after the number of [[lawsuit]]s, naturism became tolerated in selected "unofficial" beaches and distant spots.

In today's Poland naturism is practiced in number of the seaside and inland beaches. Most Polish beaches are actually [[Free beach|clothes-optional]] rather than naturist. Among the most popular locations are [[Misdroy|Misdroy-Lubiewo]], Grzybowo, [[Rowy, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Rowy]], Dębki, [[Gdańsk|Gdańsk-Stogi]] and Piaski. The most popular inland locations include [[Warsaw]] (Wał Miedzeszyński), Kazimierz Dolny and Kryspinów near [[Kraków]]. In the winter season, naturism is practiced by organized groups in [[Warsaw]] and [[Tricity, Poland|Tri-City]]. Public naturist events are held bi-monthly in [[Poznań|Poznań-Koziegłowy]] and [[Łódź]] [[waterparks|waterpark]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Portugal ===
{{main|Naturism in Portugal}}
Naturism in Portugal had its first historical record around 1920, linked to the Portuguese Naturist Society, of which the anarcho-syndicalist José Peralta was a prominent member. Nudity was already being practiced on [[Costa da Caparica]] beaches. With the beginning of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]] authoritarian regime in the 1930s, the naturist movement was limited to vegetarian and alternative medicines, since nudity was banned and associated to the crime of "indecency". Only after the end of the New State regime in 1974 (April, 25th) the activities linked to the practice of nudity were resumed.

The ''Federação Portuguesa de Naturismo'' (Portuguese Naturist Federation) or FPN was founded on the March 1st, 1977, at a meeting in Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpn.pt/sobre_nos/quem_somos_en.php|title=Home &gt; About Us &gt; Who We Are|publisher=Portuguese Naturist Federation|accessdate=2 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203081647/http://www.fpn.pt/sobre_nos/quem_somos_en.php|archivedate=3 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the present, there are seven official naturist beaches in Portugal. Besides these, there are several dozens of beaches were the practice of naturism is common. There are also several naturist campings and resorts.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Slovenia ===
Beginnings of naturism in Slovenia started in the year 1852, when a 29 year old Swiss physician [[Arnold Rikli]] visited [[Bled]] for the first time. In the following years he started to promote healthy way of living, because he considered water, air and light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zupanic-Slavec|first1=Z|last2=Toplak|first2=C|title=Water, air and light--Arnold Rikli (1823-1906)|journal=Gesnerus|date=1998|volume=55|issue=1–2|pages=58–69|pmid=9684537|doi=10.5169/seals-520867}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the source for his healing therapy. He continued to build [[spa]] centers which included [[light therapy]] and [[hydrotherapy]] treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resonantfm.com/a-very-brief-history-of-red-light/|title=A Very Brief History of Red Light|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first visitors were most likely [[pilgrim]]s from Slovenia and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] region who visited the church on Bled island. When the word has spread across Europe, other visitors started visiting Bled known for Rikli's healing therapy. A method used in the healing therapy process included [[sunbathing]] and visitors were often seen walking nude in public. Rikli continued to promote his healing tourism for the next 52 years, when he lived in Bled.

=== Spain ===
[[File:Nudist-Textile couple in Cabo de Gata, Spain.jpg|thumb|Nudist man and textile woman on a beach in Spain.]]
Public nudity in Spain is not illegal since there is no law banning its practice. Spanish legislation foresees felony for exhibitionism but restricts its scope to obscene exposure in front of children or mentally impaired individuals, i.e. with sexual connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1995-25444&amp;tn=1&amp;p=20150428#a185|title=BOE.es - Documento consolidado BOE-A-1995-25444|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, people do not normally use this right to be naked to do it anywhere, and most usually perform this activity in places where nudism is a tradition.

There are however some municipalities (like [[San Pedro del Pinatar, Spain|San Pedro del Pinatar]]) where public nudity has been regulated (banned) by means of [[By-law|by-laws]]. Other municipalities (like [[Barcelona]], [[Salou]], [[Platja de Palma]] and [[Sant Antoni de Portmany]]) have also used these provisions to regulate the practice of semi-nudism, forcing people to cover their torso on the streets. Some naturist associations have appealed these by-laws on the grounds that a fundamental right ([[freedom of expression]], as they understand that nudism is a way of self-expression) cannot be regulated with this mechanism. Some judicial instances have ruled in favour of nudist associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-federacion-espanola-naturismo-recurre-tsjc-prohibicion-nudismo-barcelona-20110717185055.html|title=La Federación Española de Naturismo recurre ante el TSJC la prohibición del nudismo en Barcelona|last=Press|first=Europa|date=2011-07-17|work=europapress.es|access-date=2017-12-03|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elconfidencialdigital.com/la_buena_vida/tendencias/localidades-multan-vas-camiseta-calle_0_2300169989.html|title=Cuatro localidades donde te multan si vas sin camiseta por la calle|work=El Confidencial Digital|access-date=2017-12-03|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudism in Spain is normally practised by the seaside, on beaches or small coves with a tradition on naturism. In [[Vera, Spain|Vera]] ([[Andalusia]]), there is a wide residential area formed by nudist urbanisations that constitute some kind of nudist town. Nudist organisations may organise some activities elsewhere in inner territory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naturismo.org/adn/calendario.html|title=Calendario actividades 2017. ADN: Asociación para el Desarrollo del Naturismo de la Comunidad de Madrid|website=www.naturismo.org|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (like hiking on the mountains close to Madrid), but these kind of activities are negligible. Madrid municipality enables nudist use of some of their public swimming pools one day during summer.

Textile use of traditionally nudist public spaces (like beaches or streets nearby) is allowed, mainly due to lack of regulation. Mixed groups of nudist and textile individuals are frequent in these kind of spaces. In order to chase voyeuristic persons away, nudist people will normally clap their hands.

Legal aspects regarding topless are analogue to those regarding nudism, but social tolerance towards topless is higher. This let people not cover their breasts in public swimming pools and on any beach in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20170811/43474195994/espanolas-topless.html|title=Las españolas son las que más topless y nudismo hacen|work=La Vanguardia|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the first official nudist club was established in [[Wickford]], [[Essex]] in 1924. According to Michael Farrar, writing for [[British Naturism]] the club adopted the name "Moonella Group" from the name of the owner of the ground, ''Moonella'', and called its site [[The Camp (Naturism)|The Camp]]. Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the [[New Gymnosophy Society]]. This society had been founded a few years before by H.C. Booth, M.H. Sorensen and Rex Wellbye under the name of the [[English Gymnosophical Society]]. It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 [[High Holborn]] in London, the headquarters of the [[Women's Freedom League]]. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by an "aristocracy" of the original members, all of whom had "club names" to preserve their anonymity. The club closed in 1926 because of building on adjacent land.&lt;ref name=bntimeline&gt;{{Citation|last=Farrar |first=Michael |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=The history of naturism – a timeline |date= |year=2007 |url=http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=50 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019033149/https://british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=50 |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bnmoonella&gt;{{Citation|last=Farrar |first=Michael |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=The Moonella Group |date= |year=2007 |url=http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=42 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205201517/https://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=42 |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}

&lt;!-- [[File:WNBR Brighton 2014 04.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[World Naked Bike Ride]] in Brighton, 2014]]-- better image now used--&gt;
By 1943 there were a number of these so-called "sun clubs" and together they formed the [[British Sun Bathers Association]] or BSBA. In 1954 a group of clubs unhappy with the way the BSBA was being run split off to form the Federation of British Sun Clubs or FBSC. In 1961, the BSBA Annual Conference agreed that the term nudist was inappropriate and should be discarded in favour of naturist.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt; The two organisations rivalled each other before eventually coming together again in 1964 as the [[British Naturism|Central Council for British Naturism]] or [[British Naturism|CCBN]]. This organisation structure has remained much the same but it is now called [[British Naturism]] which is often abbreviated to BN.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt; BN is currently a [[company limited by guarantee]].

The first official nude beach was opened at [[Fairlight Glen]] in Covehurst Bay near [[Hastings]] in 1978 (not to be confused with [[Fairlight Cove]], which is 2&amp;nbsp;km to the east) followed later by the beaches at [[Brighton]] and [[Fraisthorpe]]. [[Bridlington]] opened in April 1980.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt;

== In North America ==

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], individuals around the country became interested in nudism, skinny-dipping, and physical culture in the early part of the 20th century. After 1940 they had their own Canadian magazine, ''Sunbathing &amp; Health'', which occasionally carried local news. Canadians had scattered groups in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, and continues today in North Vancouver, BC.,{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} and, in Ontario, the Sun Air Club.

Canadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

Most of those clubs united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in the breakup of CSA into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next decade and a half, leading to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA continues today as the American Association for Nude Recreation&amp;nbsp;– Western Canadian Region (www.aanr-wc.com), a region of the [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) which itself was formerly known as the ASA.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

In 1977 the [[La Fédération Québécoise de Naturisme|Fédération québécoise de naturisme]] (FQN) was founded in Quebec, by Michel Vaïs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet. In 1985 the [[Federation of Canadian Naturists]] (FCN) was formed with the support of the FQN. In 1988 the FQN and FCN formed the [[FQN-FCN Union]] as the official Canadian representative in the [[International Naturist Federation]] (INF).{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

In 1925, Katherine and Herman Shoshinki were familiar with nudism from Germany from 1918 to 1923. Kurt Barthel founded the [[American League for Physical Culture]] in 1929 and organized the first nudist event. In about 1930 they organized the [[American Gymnosophical Association]]. Barthel founded America's first official [[nudist]] camp, Sky Farm in [[New Jersey]], in May, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Ellensburg Daily Record, Aug 2, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1932, AGA established the [[Rock Lodge Club]] as a nudist facility in [[Stockholm, New Jersey]] and [[Ilsley Boone]], a [[Dutch Reformed]] minister, formed the [[Christian naturism]] movement. Naturism began expanding nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clothesfree.com/history.html |title=The History of Social Nudism – Nudist History |publisher=Clothesfree.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/a-brief-history-of-naturism-nudism History of Naturism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002734/http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/a-brief-history-of-naturism-nudism |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lupinlodge.org/history.html |title=Body Acceptance: A Brief History of Social Nudity |publisher=Lupinlodge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019234814/http://www.lupinlodge.org/history.html |archivedate=2012-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nef.oshkosh.net/Toni_Egbert_Library/US_District_Courts/Roberts_v__Clement/roberts_v__clement.html |title=Roberts v.

The [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) is the national naturist organization. [[Arnd Krüger]] compared nudists in Germany and the United States and came to the conclusion that in Germany the racial aspects (''Zuchtwahl'') were important for the breakthrough (e.g. the Commanding General of the Army served as patron for nudists events), while in the U.S. nudism was far more commercial and had thus more difficulties.{{sfn|Krüger|1992|p=343}} The AANR withdrew from the INF in 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{clarify|date=September 2015}}&lt;!-- what's this mean to U.S. nudism? --&gt;

In 2008, a young adults group organized as Florida Young Naturists&lt;ref name="Florida Young Naturists FYN"/&gt; held their first Naked Bash which has since been repeated 3-4 times a year, growing into one of the largest young naturist gatherings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/music/top-10-reasons-to-get-totally-nude-at-the-florida-young-naturists-naked-spring-bash-nsfw-6424673|title=Top 10 Reasons to Get Totally Nude at the Florida Young Naturists' Naked Spring Bash|last=|first=|date=|website=New Times Broward-Palm Beach|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a campaign to promote Nudism in the United States occurred with an effort by AANR to record the largest simultaneous Skinny Dip at several U.S. Clubs and beaches, occurring on July 11 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wreckbeach.org/archive/AANRWorldRecordSkinnyDipFinal.pdf|title=The AANR World Record Skinny-Dip|last=|first=|date=|website=Wreck beach|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, an organization called Unconstitutional Arkansas was created to highlight the unconstitutionality of laws that prohibit or impede nudism.

== In Asia ==

Generally, public nudity in Asia is not tolerated. However, some traditional, religious or cultural nudity has survived the introduction of Western moral values against nudity, such as the Jain Digambara monks in India, hot springs in Taiwan and Japan, and some traditional tribes in Papua. Nudism and naked recreation is slowly developing in some countries, mainly Indonesia (Bali) and Thailand. Nudists meet on the internet (e.g. Bareskinasia.com) and organize activities in remote or private locations. Several nudists also have their own blogs.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Indonesia ===
In the seventies, nudity on [[Bali]]'s remote and deserted beaches was common but with the massive growth of tourism, this practice has disappeared. In 2002, nudity was declared illegal on Petitenget Beach, the last beach in [[Seminyak]] that tolerated discreet nudity. Individuals began to practice nudity in private villas and resorts. Laki Uma Villa, the first naturist facility to open, was for gay men only. Bali au Naturel, the first adult-only nudist resort for both genders, opened its doors in 2004. It subsequently expanded from 3 to 15 rooms and added from two more swimming pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unseen Bali|url=http://www.unseenbali.org|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nepal ===
Nudism is considered [[taboo]] in [[Nepal]]. Although there are no laws governing nudism, people may be detained, arrested and fined for public nudity. Nevertheless, many [[Hindu]] male sages practice nudism and they are not legally detained. Nudist sages can be seen in [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Thailand ===
Nudism was successfully introduced 10 years ago in [[Pattaya]] (Chan Resort), and six more nudist resorts have been created all over [[Thailand]]. Barefeet Resort in Bangkok, Lemon Tree in Phuket, Oriental Village in Chiangmai, Phuan Naturist Village in Huay Yai, and Family Naturist Camp in Petchaburi all belong to the Naturist Association of Thailand as well as other international naturist organizations. A gay hotel and sauna (Sansuk Hotel) located in Pattaya now also authorizes nudity in and around the swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.199.190.19/~sgt/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=27690 Nudity and naturism in Pattaya] Sawatdee Gay Thailand {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206045956/http://66.199.190.19/~sgt/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=27690 |date=2014-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues in social nudity ==
{{main|Issues in social nudity}}
[[File:Naturism.jpg|thumb|A naturist  &lt;nowiki&gt;''au naturel''&lt;/nowiki&gt; ]]
Naturism addresses, challenges and explores a myriad of sometimes [[taboo]] subjects: stereotypes and mores relating to the nude appearance of the human body, mixed [[sex]] nudity, [[personal space]], [[human sexuality]], [[gymnophobia]], [[modesty]], [[physical attractiveness]], [[vanity]], [[objectification]],  exploitation and [[consent]]. It can thus be controversial. Descamps assembled a list of criticisms of naturism: it is too cold; normal bodies look ugly—it is only for the physically beautiful; it is too embarrassing; it is against the laws of nature, against the law, or against religion; "[[nudity and sexuality|nudism makes me think of sex]]"; it is for primitive people or animals.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

Naturism can sometimes contain aspects of eroticism, although the debate about this is often simplified and seen negatively in the media and the public mind and by many modern naturists and naturist organisations. Historically the experience and discussion of erotic feelings during naturist activities such as dance and gymnastics played an important part in early Germanic naturism and formed part of its 'positive' connection with nature. However, it was when naturism arrived in the more sexually conservative cultures of the UK and the United States that the expression and discussion of eroticism within naturism became frowned upon.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

Smith states {{quote|the main reason younger people are not becoming naturists is the inability of modern naturism to engage with the issue of sexuality. While it is true that "naturism became popular in Germany...as a healthy outdoor lifestyle", this lifestyle also included a recognition that, socially, nudity could sometimes be erotic. It was only when naturism arrived in a more sexually conservative Britain that sexual feelings were censored out to make naturism culturally acceptable.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}  }}  This statement is in response to the quote "The world of naturism is in trouble. Membership is falling, and fewer young people than ever are getting involved. Has the great nude adventure run its course? "{{sfn|Barkham|2007}}

Smith and King pose the [[Issues in social nudity#Sexual wellbeing|further points]] in their 2009 peer reviewed paper ''Naturism and Sexuality:broadening our approach to sexual wellbeing ''{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

=== Issues for the naturist community ===
Many countries and states have laws which adversely affect naturists. Oftentimes, these laws are intended to address "indecent exposure", but are so broadly written that they criminalize ordinary, non-sexual nudity. Some laws, however, specifically target naturism. For example, in [[Arkansas]] in the United States, not only is nudism illegal (even on private property), it is a crime to "promote" or "advocate" (i.e. express a favourable opinion about) nudism.&lt;ref name="UnconstitutionalArkansas.org"/&gt;

Any social group is said to go through four phases:
[[Forming-storming-norming-performing|forming, storming, norming, performing]], wrote [[Bruce Tuckman]] in 1965. In this context one can understand some of the current pressures on various aspects of naturism:

* Naturist club isolation: established clubs excluding new members and rejecting new ideas.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}
* A family movement in a time of social change: a change in needs and expectations, away from one of a permanent commitment towards one of change and choice.
* Multi-gen preferences: each generation is a specific social group which needs to have its own norms that are consistent with common rules.
* Clubs vs. holiday centres: organizations with different roots find it difficult to establish common rules. The contention between those espousing a year-round commitment to an ideal, and those who see it as summer-only recreation. Club naturism is declining, while the number of people that assume naturist facilities will be available at any holiday resort is rising. The number of users of free beaches may exceed the number of people who wish to join a club.&lt;!-- Please add a statistic --&gt;
* Paid staff and volunteers: many clubs were established as cooperatives, but the values change when a few members put in the capital or work needed.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} This became more difficult when some members were paid to act as site managers.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}
* Infiltration by other groups: for many years clubs had strict "No singles" policies to maintain the family nature of the club.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} Many other social groups practice non-family nudism, whether it be social singles, [[Homosexuality|gay]] naturists or [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]].
* [[Exhibitionism|Exhibitionists]] and [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]]: as unwelcome in a naturist community as in a clothed community.&lt;ref name="CCBN172"&gt;{{Citation  | last =Boura  | first =Malcolm    | title = Campaigning  | journal =British Naturism  | volume =BN 172  | issue =  | page = 31  | date =Summer 2007  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | issn = 0264-0406}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Risk of being filmed in nude without permission, such as at nude beach. Such photos and videos can then be put on internet.
* Sunburn and skin cancer.
*Large numbers of clothed people visit clothing optional and nudist beaches and make the naturists feel uncomfortable, "like they've become a spectacle".&lt;ref name="abc2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Broome nudists in battle for beach as naturism declines | last = Parke | first = Erin | work = ABC News | date = 24 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-24/is-public-nudity-on-the-wane-in-australia/7653938 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc._Getn"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Get naked or take a hike, angry nudists tell 'lookie-loos' | author =  | work = CBC News | date = 21 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/nudists-canada-overexposure-turf-war-1.3689094 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thes_Hanl"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Hanlan’s Point nudists want beach-goers to bare all | last = Botelho-Urbanski | first = Jessica | work = Toronto Star | date = 20 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/07/20/hanlans-point-nudists-want-beach-goers-to-bare-all.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An issue, a decade ago in naturist resorts like [[Cap d'Agde]] has been the clash between "fundamentalist" naturists and the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|échangistes]] who are sexually open &lt;!--(including those who do [[oral sex]], [[group sex]] or practise [[BDSM]])--&gt; on the naturist beaches and bars.&lt;ref name="outrage"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Outraged villagers protest over open-air sex at naturist beach | author =  Kim Willsher | work = Guardian News | date = 7 Nov 2010 | accessdate = 28 Dec 2017 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/07/open-air-sex-nudist-beach }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines ===
Magazines published by, for or purportedly about naturists can be grouped:

* Magazines published by an "official" national organisation, such as ''BN'' ([[British Naturism]]), ''Going Natural/Au naturel'' ([[Federation of Canadian Naturists|FCN/FQN]]), ''Nude &amp; Natural Magazine'' [[The Naturist Society|TNS]], ''gonatural'' (New Zealand Naturist Federation).
* Independent magazines published for naturists, such as ''Naturally'', ''[[H&amp;E naturist]]'' and ''TAN'' (acronym of ''The Australian Naturist'').
* Magazines that print photographs only or primarily of young female professional models, which are disapproved of by many naturists and non-naturists alike.

Magazines in the second and, occasionally, third grouping feature naturist editorial and advertising, while some naturists argue over which magazines belonged in which of these categories&amp;nbsp;– these views may change as publishers and editors change. Many clubs and groups have benefitted from magazines which, while not exclusively or even predominantly naturist in character, made naturist information available to many who would not otherwise have been aware of it.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}  (These days, the information and advertising provided online, and the wide availability of free online porn, has meant the disappearance of old-style 'skin' magazines presenting significant glamour content masquerading as or alongside naturist content.  Naturist magazines have to appeal strongly to naturists to succeed&amp;nbsp;– they cannot sit on the fence between naturism and glamour.)
Some naturists still feel that the worthwhile editorial content in some magazines is not a fair balance for the disapproved-of photographic content.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

=== Photography, films and videos ===
Some naturist clubs have been willing to allow filming by the media on their grounds, though content that proved not to be of genuine naturism can end up being parodied by the media as the norm.&lt;ref name=telegraph &gt;{{Citation | last = Edwards| first = Adam| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =  Stark naked ambition| date = 10 May 2006 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/05/10/ftnude10.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2006/05/10/ixartright.html | accessdate = 2007-12-02 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | publisher = [[Sunday Telegraph]]}} gives a history of naturism, written in a personal style that attempts to use this type of humour.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commercial 'naturist' DVDs are dominated by imagery of naked children.  Such material can be marketed in ways that appear to appeal directly to paedophile inclinations, and ownership of these DVDs (and their earlier video cassette incarnations) has resulted in successful British prosecutions for possession of indecent images of children.&lt;ref name=crowther1&gt;{{Citation | title = Gay reverend fined over 'indecent' images of boys | url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gay-reverend-fined-over-indecent-images-of-boys-26300917.html | accessdate = 3 April 2014 | work = Irish Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crowther2&gt;{{Citation|title=Rector found guilty over indecent images |date=29 June 2007 |url=http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=63004 |accessdate=4 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304193047/http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=63004 |archivedate= 4 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocarroll1&gt;{{Citation | title = Paedophile campaigner walks free | work = BBC News online | date = 26 November 2002 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2516383.stm | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case was appealed, unsuccessfully, to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=ocarroll2&gt;{{Citation | title = O'Carroll vs the United Kingdom | date = 15 May 2005 | url=http://echr.ketse.com/doc/35557.03-en-20050315/view/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precedents set by the court cases mean that possession in Britain of any naturist image of a child is, potentially, grounds for prosecution.

Photo shoots, including major high-profile works by [[Spencer Tunick]], are done on public places including beaches.{{efn|Photography in public nude beaches

Nudists who visit public nude beaches may be photographed by [[street photography|street photographers]], [[social documentary photography|social documentary photographers]], [[photojournalism|photojournalists]] or other kinds of photographers without the nudists' knowledge and in the United States and most democratic countries the photographers have the law on their side as no individual has an [[expectation of privacy]] in a [[public place]] and photographers are not required to have the naturists' consent before photographing them or publishing and selling the pictures or videos.{{sfn|NJ|2011}} In many countries there exist private nudist areas in which photography is not allowed and naturists who wish to not be photographed can enjoy their activities there. However, naturists who wish to not be photographed in public nude beaches have found various ways to make the photographers leave the beach, such as photographing the photographer and publishing such photos.

Some nude beaches provide fences that block the view from nearby streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g147317-d155079-i25617439-Club_Ambiance-Runaway_Bay_Saint_Ann_Parish_Jamaica.html Trip Advisor]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Needs ref and maybe a naturist magazines list page --&gt;
&lt;!-- ==Terminology==
* ''Clothist'' is a term describing someone who does not practice social nudity.-- Is there a reference for this term?-- Never heard it used in Europe. Supported by Korky Day
* ''[[Gymnophobia]]'' is an irrational fear or anxiety about being seen naked, or about seeing others naked.

=== Humour ===
* A ''cottontail'' is a term describing someone whose [[buttocks]] are paler than his or her legs and back, caused by [[sun tanning]] while wearing a swimsuit. (US specific)
* In uniform, ie nude.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}
* A ''[[acomoclitism|shaved]]'' individual or ''smoothie'' is one who shaves off much of his/her body hair, including the pubic hair. This is so common now- does the word still exist? It sounds derogatory
* ''[[Topfree]]'' means bare-chested (leaving chest and breasts uncovered), or a place that allows uncovered female and male chests. The term was coined by activists to use instead of the term "topless", which has a negative connotation to some, in part because it is used by strip clubs. Naturist women felt they'd rather be "free" than "less". Topless is also used. Is this not a historical term that is no longer current? --&gt;
&lt;!-- Recent research has begun to explore this complex and historical relationship while highlighting how erotic experiences within naturism may actually enhance sexual wellbeing and be a positive force within naturism.&lt;ref name=smithking/&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- {{POV-statement|date=November 2008}} Summary of chapter 1, of Descamps which is referenced above-- this subsection is about opinions- please suggest  better wording on the talk page --&gt;
&lt;!-- See talk page for discussion of Nikki Craft- and her display of disturbing links --&gt;
&lt;!-- Those inexperienced in social nudity often say that they fear that it contributes to an imbalance of power between men and women. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} They say that women and children are more vulnerable when nude, and can be exploited.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} While that might be true in a situation of commercial nudity, such as a strip club, women advocates of social nudity assert the opposite, especially in an established nude group. The men are nude there as well, no money is changing hands, nor is anyone in any sense giving a "performance". No one pays to be nude and no one is being paid to be nude. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  Padding --&gt;
&lt;!-- Move to new page: * [[Arkansas]], which calls itself "The Natural State" on its licence plates, has made it illegal for people to advocate nudism under code 5-68-204 section C which states:
: "''It is unlawful for any:
: ''(1)  Person, club, camp, corporation, partnership, association, or organization to advocate, demonstrate, or promote nudism; or  ''
: ''(2)  Person to rent, lease, or otherwise permit his or her land, premises, or buildings to be used for the purpose of advocating, demonstrating, or promoting nudism.''" its none too easy to do in Saudi Arabia either --&gt;
&lt;!-- Some people believe that the naked human body is to be accepted, respected, cherished, and enjoyed. They believe it is not inherently shameful, corrupting, degrading, or dangerous. Many of them enjoy clothes free activities. They reject views that being naked with other people is morally wrong ([[indecent exposure|indecent]]), [[sexual]] ''per se'' ([[erotic]] or [[pornographic]]). They argue that nakedness is a healthy, [[nature|natural]] state, that being nude is to be in the purest form, since everyone was [[birth|born]] nude. They generally find that they quickly become so accustomed to being nude among nudes that it no longer seems very remarkable. It is, rather, simply one part of their [[lifestyle]].
 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Practitioners say that they are not pruriently interested in seeing others naked (which, if for sexual pleasure, is called [[voyeurism]]) or in being seen naked by others (likewise: [[exhibitionism]]). --&gt;

'''Opus Dei''', formally known as '''The Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei''' ({{lang-la|Praelatura Sanctae Crucis et Operis Dei}}), is an institution of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] which teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to [[Sacred|sanctity]].&lt;ref name="UTSIT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2002/october/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20021007_opus-dei_en.html | title=Address of John Paul II in Praise of St. Josemaría, Founder of Opus Dei | accessdate=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of its membership are lay people; the remainder are [[Secular clergy|secular priests]] under the governance of a [[prelate]] elected by specific members and appointed by the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?p=25468 Upon whom does the prelate of Opus Dei depend?

{{See also|Timeline of Opus Dei}}

===Foundational period===
Opus Dei was founded by a Catholic priest, Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, on 2 October 1928 in Madrid, Spain. According to Escrivá, on that day he experienced a vision in which he "saw Opus Dei".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.josemariaescriva.info/index.php?id_cat=271&amp;id_scat=270|work=JosemariaEscriva.info|title=Opus Dei | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/1409237/Vatican-proves-the-power-of-Opus-Dei-founder.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Vatican proves the power of Opus Dei Founder | accessdate=27 November 2006 | location=London | first=Graeme | last=Archer | date=5 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave the organization the name "Opus Dei", which in Latin means "Work of God",&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; in order to underscore the belief that the organization was not his (Escrivá's) work, but was rather God's work.&lt;ref name="BENEDICTONESCRIVA"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&amp;p=4761 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Pope Benedict XVI on St. Josemaría Escriva | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, Escrivá held that the founding of Opus Dei had a supernatural character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.josemariaescriva.info/index.php?id_cat=218&amp;id_scat=35 | work=JosemariaEscriva.info | title=The Founding of Opus Dei | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escrivá summarized Opus Dei's mission as a way of helping ordinary Christians "to understand that their life... is a way of holiness and evangelization... And to those who grasp this ideal of holiness, the Work offers the spiritual assistance and training they need to put it into practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/conversations/point/60 | title=''Conversations'' 60 | first=Josemaría | last=Escrivá | accessdate=16 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Opus Dei was open only to men, but in 1930, Escrivá started to admit women, based on what he believed to be a communication from God.&lt;ref name=Berglar/&gt; In 1936, the organization suffered a temporary setback with the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], as many Catholic priests and religious figures, including Escrivá, were forced into hiding (the Catholic Church actively supported the Nationalist-Fascist rebels). The many atrocities committed during the civil war included the murder and rape of religious figures by anti-Franco [[Anarchists]].&lt;ref name="PRESTON"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Paul Preston| title=Franco. A Biography | year=1993 | publisher=HarperCollins| isbn=0-00-215863-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the civil war was won by General [[Francisco Franco]], Escrivá was able to return to Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.josemariaescriva.info/index.php?id_cat=293&amp;id_scat=270 | work=JosemariaEscriva.info | title=Historical Overview | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escrivá himself recounted that it was in Spain where Opus Dei found "the greatest difficulties" because of traditionalists who he felt misunderstood Opus Dei's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/conversations/point/33| title=''Conversations'' 33| first=Josemaría | last=Escrivá | accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Opus Dei flourished during the years of the [[Spain under Franco|Franquismo]], spreading first throughout Spain, and after 1945, expanding internationally.&lt;ref name=Berglar/&gt;

In 1939, Escrivá published ''[[The Way (book)|The Way]]'', a collection of 999 maxims concerning spirituality for people involved in secular affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/the_way | work=EscrivaWorks.org | title=The Way | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, Opus Dei found an early critic in the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit Superior General]] [[Wlodimir Ledóchowski]], who told the Vatican that he considered Opus Dei "very dangerous for the Church in Spain," citing its "secretive character" and calling it "a form of Christian [[Freemasonry|Masonry]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/dvc_3.html | author=Philip Copens | title=Deciphering the Da Vinci Code | accessdate=27 November 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027212553/http://www.philipcoppens.com/dvc_3.html | archivedate=27 October 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, a year after Escrivá moved the organization's headquarters to Rome, Opus Dei received a decree of praise and approval from Pope Pius XII, making it an institute of "pontifical right", i.e. under the direct governance of the Pope.&lt;ref name=Berglar/&gt; In 1950,  Pius XII granted definitive approval to Opus Dei, thereby allowing married people to join the organization, and secular clergy to be admitted to the [[Priestly Society of the Holy Cross]].&lt;ref name=Berglar/&gt;

===Post-foundational years===
In 1975, Escriva died and was succeeded by [[Álvaro del Portillo]]. In 1982, Opus Dei was made into a [[personal prelature]]. This means that Opus Dei is part of the universal Church, and the apostolate of the members falls under the direct jurisdiction of the Prelate of Opus Dei wherever they are. As to "what the law lays down for all the ordinary faithful", the lay members of Opus Dei, being no different from other Catholics, "continue to be ... under the jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop", in the words of John Paul II's ''Ut Sit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_781530298/Opus_Dei.html |work=MSN Encarta |title=Opus Dei |accessdate=27 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508121557/http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_781530298/Opus_Dei.html |archivedate=8 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, [[Javier Echevarria]] became Prelate upon the death of his predecessor.
[[File:Opus Dei expansion.svg|thumb|400px|left|History of the spread of Opus Dei by country]]
One-third of the world's bishops sent letters petitioning for the canonization of Escrivá.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=3720 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Blessed Josemaría Escrivá to be canonised | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escriva was [[Beatification|beatified]] in 1992 in the midst of controversy prompted by questions about Escriva's suitability for sainthood. In 2002, approximately 300,000 people gathered in St. Peter's Square on the day Pope John Paul II canonized Josemaría Escrivá.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives/101802/101802h.htm | work=National Catholic Reporter | title=300,000 pilgrims turn out for canonisation of Opus Dei founder | author=John L.

There are other members whose process of beatification has been opened: [[Ernesto Cofiño]], a father of five children and a pioneer in pediatric research in Guatemala; [[Montserrat Grases]], a teenage Catalan student who died of cancer; [[List of members of Opus Dei#Social work and medicine|Toni Zweifel]], a Swiss engineer; Tomás Alvira and wife, Paquita Domínguez, a Spanish married couple;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=15190| work=Catholic News Agency| title=Cardinal Rouco opens cause of canonization for Spanish couple| accessdate=4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidoro Zorzano Ledesma]], an Argentinian engineer;  [[Dora del Hoyo]], a domestic worker;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opusdei.ph/art.php?p=49368|title=Dora del Hoyo's Cause of Canonization Opened in Rome|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Father José Luis Múzquiz de Miguel.

During the pontificate of John Paul II, two members of Opus Dei, [[Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne]] and [[Julián Herranz Casado]], were made [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&amp;p=6908 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Cardinals Tauran and Herranz installed at their titular churches | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] blessed a newly installed statue of [[Josemaría Escrivá]] placed in an outside wall niche of St Peter's Basilica, a place for founders of Catholic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cathnews.com/news/509/83.php |work=The Guardian |agency=Associated Press |title=Pope blesses statue of Opus Dei founder |accessdate=2 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211133234/http://www.cathnews.com/news/509/83.php |archivedate=11 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During that same year, Opus Dei received some unwanted attention due to the extraordinary success of the novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', in which both Opus Dei and the Catholic Church itself are depicted negatively. The film version was released globally in May 2006, further polarizing views on the organization.

In 2014, [[Pope Francis]] through a delegate beatified [[Alvaro del Portillo]] and said that "he teaches us that in the simplicity and ordinariness of our life we can find a sure path to holiness.&lt;ref name="zenit.org"&gt;[Don Alvaro del Portillo Beatified in Madrid http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/don-alvaro-del-portillo-beatified-in-madrid]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2014, the prelature has been established in 69 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opusdei.org/en-us/document/letter-from-the-prelate-10-december-2014/|title=Letter from the Prelate (10 December 2014)|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its members are present in 90 countries.&lt;ref name="catholicnewsagency.com"/&gt;

Bishop Echevarría died on 12 December 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lainformacion.com/religion-y-credos/Javier-Echevarria-fallece-opus-dei_0_980303587.html |title=Fallece en Roma el prelado del Opus Dei, monseñor Javier Echevarría|date=12 December 2016|work=Lainformacion.es|language=es|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was succeeded by Msgr. [[Fernando Ocáriz Braña|Fernando Ocáriz]]. He was elected the new prelate of Opus Dei on 23 January 2017, and on the same day was appointed by Pope Francis as such.

===Doctrine===
{{Main article|Teachings of Opus Dei}}

Opus Dei is an organization of the [[Catholic Church]]. As such, it shares the [[Roman Catholic Church#Doctrine|doctrines of the Catholic Church]] and has "no other teaching than the teaching of the [[Magisterium]] of the [[Holy See]]", as per the founder.&lt;ref&gt;Josemaria Escriva, Letter 14 February 1964, 1 quoted in [http://opusdei.org.sg/en-sg/document/pastoral-letter-october-2-2011/ 2 October 2011 Pastoral Letter of Bishop Javier Echevarria]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opus Dei places special emphasis on certain aspects of Catholic doctrine. A central feature of Opus Dei's theology is its focus on the lives of the ordinary Catholics who are neither priests nor monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.catholicity.com/mccloskey/popeandopusdei.html | work=Crisis Magazine | author=Fr. John McCloskey|date=March 1995 | title=The Pope and Opus Dei | accessdate=27 November 2006}} ''mirrored on CatholiCity''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&amp;p=9319 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Opus Dei's focus on secular life | accessdate=28 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nysun.com/article/30310?access=391277 | work=The New York Sun | title='Da Vinci' And Opus Dei | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opus Dei emphasizes the "[[universal call to holiness]]": the belief that everyone should aspire to be a saint, as per Jesus' commandment to "Love God with all your heart" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|22:37|NRSV|}}) and "Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect." ({{bibleverse||Matthew|5:48|NRSV|}}) Opus Dei also teaches that sanctity is within the reach of everyone, not just a few special individuals, given Jesus' teaching that his demands are "easy" and "light," as his divine assistance is assured. ({{bibleverse|Matthew||11:28–30|NRSV|}})&lt;ref&gt;Escriva, J, ''Christ is Passing By'', n. 176; ''Friends of God'', n. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5029154 | work=National Public Radio | title=A Glimpse Inside a Catholic 'Force': Opus Dei | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opus Dei does not have monks or nuns, and only a minority of its members are priests.&lt;ref name="CATHOLICDAVINCI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=19147 |work=Catholic News Service |title=Opus Dei called 'complete opposite' of 'The Da Vinci Code' portrayal |accessdate=27 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008233057/http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=19147 |archivedate=8 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opus Dei emphasizes uniting spiritual life with professional, social, and family life. Members of Opus Dei lead ordinary lives, with traditional families and secular careers,&lt;ref name="MESSAGE"/&gt; and strive to "sanctify ordinary life". Indeed, Pope John Paul II called Escrivá "the saint of ordinary life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-05/2006-05-22-voa20.cfm?CFID=2829126&amp;CFTOKEN=35170673 | archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060629121920/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-05/2006-05-22-voa20.cfm?CFID=2829126&amp;CFTOKEN=35170673 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=29 June 2006 | work=JoseMaria.info|title=Decree of Canonization | accessdate=27 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Opus Dei stresses the importance of work and professional competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/furrow-chapter-15.htm

Sanctify yourself in your work. Sanctify others through your work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://en.romana.org/?s=11.2&amp;n=35&amp;ID=5 | work=Romana: Official Bulletin of Opus Dei | title=Homily of Bishop Echevarría | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biblical roots of this Catholic doctrine, according to the founder, are in the phrase "God created man to work" (Gen 2:15) and [[Jesus]]'s long life as an ordinary carpenter in a small town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/conversations-point-55.htm
| author=Josemaría Escrivá | work=Conversations | title=What is the Attraction of Opus Dei | accessdate=4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escrivá, who stressed the Christian's duty to follow Christ's example, also points to the gospel account that Jesus "has done everything well" (Mk 7:37).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/friends_of_god-point-56.htm
| author=Josemaría Escrivá|work=Friends of God | title=Working for God | accessdate=4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of the Christian life, stressed Escrivá, is ''[[divine filiation]]'': Christians are children of God, identified with Christ's life and mission. Other main features of Opus Dei, according to its official literature, are: ''freedom'', respecting choice and taking personal responsibility; and ''charity'', love of God above all and love of others.&lt;ref name="MESSAGE"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=12224 | work=Opus Dei website | title=Message of Opus Dei | accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the bottom of Escrivá's understanding of the "universal call to holiness" are two dimensions, subjective and objective, according to [[Fernando Ocariz]], a Catholic theologian and Prelate of Opus Dei since 2017. The subjective is the call given to each person to become a saint, regardless of his place in society. The objective refers to what Escrivá calls [[Christian materialism]]: all of creation, even the most material situation, is a meeting place with God, and leads to union with Him.&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOK"/&gt;

===Prayers===
{{See also|Interior life (Catholic theology)}}

All members – whether married or unmarried, priests or laypeople – are trained to follow a 'plan of life', or 'the norms of piety', which are some traditional [[Catholic devotions]]. This is meant to follow the teaching of the Catholic Catechism: "pray at specific times...to nourish continual prayer,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p4s1c3.htm | work=Catechism of the Catholic Church no. 2697-8 | title=The Life of Prayer | accessdate=20 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is based on [[Jesus]]' "pray at all times" ({{bibleverse||Luke|18:1|NRSV|}}), echoed by St. Paul's "pray without ceasing" ({{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:17|NRSV}}). According to Escriva, the vocation to Opus Dei is a calling to be a "contemplative in the middle of the world," who converts work and daily life into prayer.

Also members are expected to make a day-trip pilgrimage where they recite 3 5-decade rosaries on the month of May in honor of Mary.

===Mortification===
{{See also|Mortification of the flesh}}

Much public attention has focused on Opus Dei's practice of [[Mortification in Roman Catholic teaching|mortification]]—the voluntary offering up of discomfort or pain to God; this includes fasting, or for some of its members self-inflicted pain such as [[self-flagellation]]. Mortification has a long history in many world religions, including the Catholic Church. It has been endorsed by Popes as a way of following Christ, who died in a bloody [[crucifixion]] and who speaking of anybody that sought to be his disciple: "let him deny himself, take up his cross daily and follow me." (Lk 9:23)&lt;ref name="OFFICIALDAVINCI"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=7017|work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=The Da Vinci Code, the Catholic Church and Opus Dei | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters say that opposition to mortification is rooted in having lost (1) the "sense of the enormity of [[sin]]" or offense against [[God]], and the consequent [[penance]], both interior and exterior, (2) the notions of "[[Human nature#State of nature|wounded human nature]]" and of [[concupiscence]] or inclination to sin, and thus the need for "spiritual battle,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm | work=Catechism of the Catholic Church no. 405 | title=The consequences of Adam's sin for humanity | accessdate=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (3) a spirit of [[sacrifice]] for love and "supernatural ends," and not only for physical enhancement.

As a spirituality for ordinary people, Opus Dei focuses on performing sacrifices pertaining to normal duties and to its emphasis on charity and cheerfulness. Additionally, Opus Dei celibate members practice "corporal mortifications" such as sleeping without a pillow or sleeping on the floor, fasting, and remaining silent for certain hours during the day.&lt;ref name=Ruppe/&gt;

==Organization and activities==

===Governance===
{{Main article|Personal prelature}}
In Pope John Paul II's 1982 decree known as the [[Apostolic constitution]] ''Ut Sit'', Opus Dei was established as a personal prelature, a new official structure of the [[Catholic Church]], similar to a [[diocese]] in that it contains lay people and secular priests who are led by a bishop. However, whereas a bishop normally has a territory or diocese, the prelate of Opus Dei is pastor to the members and priests of Opus Dei worldwide, no matter what diocese they are in. To date, Opus Dei is the only personal prelature in existence. In addition to being governed by ''Ut Sit'' and by the Catholic Church's general law, Opus Dei is governed by the Church's Particular Law concerning Opus Dei, otherwise known as Opus Dei's statutes. This specifies the objectives and workings of the prelature. The prelature is under the [[Congregation for Bishops]].&lt;ref name="UTSIT"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CBISUTSI.HTM|author=Pope John Paul II | title=Apostolic Constitution ''Ut Sit'', Establishing Opus Dei as the first Personal Prelature of the Catholic Church | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PLACE"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=10877 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Place in the Church | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the Opus Dei prelature is known as the Prelate.&lt;ref name="UTSIT"/&gt; The Prelate is the primary governing authority and is assisted by two councils—the General Council (made up of men) and the Central Advisory (made up of women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=13018 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=What is Opus Dei – Governance | accessdate=28 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prelate holds his position for life. The current prelate of Opus Dei is Msgr. [[Fernando Ocáriz Braña]], who became the third Prelate of Opus Dei on 23 January 2017.&lt;ref name="CNA"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/monsignor-ocariz-confirmed-as-new-prelate-of-opus-dei-21940/ | work=Catholic News Agency | title=Monsignor Ocariz confirmed as new Prelate of Opus Dei | accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Prelate of Opus Dei was [[Álvaro del Portillo]], who held the position from 1982 until his death in 1994.&lt;ref name="RAPIDAS"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ideasrapidas.org/opusdeii.htm | work=IdeasRapidas.org | title=Opus Dei | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opus Dei's highest assembled bodies are the General Congresses, which are usually convened once every eight years. There are separate congresses for the men and women's branch of Opus Dei. The General Congresses are made up of members appointed by the Prelate, and are responsible for advising him about the prelature's future. The men's General Congress also elects the Prelate from a list of candidates chosen by their female counterparts.&lt;ref name="82STATUTES"&gt;[http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=12491 Original Latin version] on Opus Dei Official Site&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of a Prelate, a special elective General Congress is convened. The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon by the men to become the next Prelate—an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope.&lt;ref name="82STATUTES"/&gt;

===Membership===
{{Main article|Types of membership of Opus Dei}}

Based on the language of Catholic Church law and theology, the prelature calls the people under the pastoral care of the prelate as "faithful of the prelature", since the term member connotes an association rather than a hierarchical structure such as a prelature or a diocese.

As of 2016, the faithful of the Opus Dei Prelature numbered 94,776 members,&lt;!-- Note that in catholic-hierarchy.org website "Catholic" does not include "Priests" (as if priests are not Catholics!) --&gt;  of which 92,667 are lay persons, men and women, and 2,109 priests.&lt;ref name=CH&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dqod0.html| work=Catholic Hierarhcy|title=Prelature of Opus Dei | accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures do not include the priest members of Opus Dei's [[Priestly Society of the Holy Cross]], estimated to number 2,000 in the year 2005.&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOK"/&gt;

About 60 per cent of Opus Dei faithful reside in Europe, and 35 per cent reside in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=26013 |work=[[Zenit News Agency]] |title=Opus Dei: Its Mission, Structure and Members |accessdate=27 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613054142/http://zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=26013 |archivedate=13 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women comprise 57% of total membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/this-is-the-process-for-opus-deis-election-of-a-new-prelate-52701/|title=This is the process for Opus Dei's election of a new prelate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study of John Allen, for the most part, Opus Dei faithful belong to the middle to low levels in society, in terms of education, income, and social status.&lt;ref name="MESSORI"/&gt;

Opus Dei is made up of several different types of faithful.&lt;ref name="BBC_RandE"/&gt;  According to the [http://opusdei.us/en-us/article/statutes-of-opus-dei/ Statutes of Opus Dei],&lt;ref&gt;The editio typica of the Statutes is given in Latin on the Opus Dei webpage.  An unofficial English translation is published on the [http://www.odan.org/statutes_1982.htm ODAN website]&lt;/ref&gt; the distinction derives from the degree to which they make themselves available for the official activities of the Prelature and for giving formation according to the spirit of Opus Dei.&lt;ref&gt;Statutes of Opus Dei 2.7&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[wikt:supernumerary|Supernumeraries]]''', the largest type, currently account for about 70% of the total membership.&lt;ref name="TRIBUNE"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-12-07/news/0312070395_1_liberal-catholics-secrets-new-york | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Catholics scrutinise enigmatic Opus Dei | accessdate=11 January 2011 | first=Ron | last=Grossman | date=7 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, supernumeraries are married men and women with careers. Supernumeraries devote a portion of their day to prayer, in addition to attending regular meetings and taking part in activities such as retreats. Due to their career and family obligations, supernumeraries are not as available to the organization as the other types of faithful, but they typically contribute financially to Opus Dei, and they lend other types of assistance as their circumstances permit.
[[Image:Ernesto Cofino.jpg|right|310px|thumb|Dr. [[Ernesto Cofiño]], Guatemalan  pioneer of pediatrics]]
'''Numeraries''', the second largest type of the faithful of Opus Dei, comprise about 20% of total membership.&lt;ref name="TRIBUNE"/&gt; Numeraries are celibate members who give themselves in "full availability" (plena disponibilitas) for the official undertakings of the Prelature.&lt;ref&gt;Statutes of Opus Dei 2.9&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes full availability for giving doctrinal and ascetical formation to other members, for staffing the internal government of Opus Dei if asked by the regional directors, and for moving to other countries to start or help with apostolic activities if asked by the Prelate.&lt;ref&gt;Statutes of Opus Dei 2.8.  See also [http://www.opusdei.org/en-us/article/members/ Christians in the Middle of the World]&lt;/ref&gt;  Because they are making themselves fully available to do whatever needs to be done for the undertakings of the Prelature, numeraries are expected to live in special centers run by Opus Dei, and the question of which particular center a numerary will live in depends upon the regional needs.&lt;ref&gt;Statutes of Opus Dei 2.8&lt;/ref&gt; "[[:wikt:numerary|Numerary]]" is a general term for persons who form part of the permanent staff of an organization. Therefore in order to maintain a family atmosphere in the centers (rather than an institutional one), it is considered very important for numeraries to participate in daily meals and "get-togethers" in which they converse and share news.&lt;ref&gt;J. Allen, Opus Dei, Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Both men and women may become numeraries in Opus Dei, although the centers are strictly gender-segregated.&lt;ref name=conservative&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.population-security.org/cffc-97-01.htm
| work=Center for Research on Population and Security | title=Conservative Catholic Influence in Europe | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numeraries generally have jobs outside of Opus Dei, although some are asked to work internally full-time and many modify the way that they go about their professional goals in order to be available for the Prelature. They devote the bulk of their income to the organization.&lt;ref name="AMERICA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/articles/martin-opusdei.cfm | work=America: The National Catholic Weekly | title=Opus Dei In the United States | author=James Martin, S.J. | accessdate=27 November 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116173841/http://www.americamagazine.org/content/articles/martin-opusdei.cfm | archivedate=16 January 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Types of membership of Opus Dei|Numerary assistants]]''' are a type of numerary that exists in the Women's Branch of Opus Dei. Their full availability for the Prelature is lived out as full availability for doing a specific type of work, namely looking after the domestic needs of the conference centers and the residential centers of Opus Dei.&lt;ref&gt;Statutes of Opus Dei 2.8 and 2.9&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence they live in special centers run by Opus Dei and do not have jobs outside the centers.

'''[[Types of membership of Opus Dei|Associates]]''' are celibate faithful who make themselves fully available to God and to others in apostolic celibacy, and stably take on at least one (sometimes more) apostolic assignment(s) from the Prelature in giving doctrinal and ascetical formation and/or coordinating activities.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Statutes of Opus Dei 2.10&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from numeraries in not making themselves "fully" available to staff the official undertakings of the Prelature, instead giving themselves in additional social realities, such as through their profession or to their own families.&lt;ref name="AMERICA"/&gt; Because of this difference in availability for the official activities of Opus Dei, unlike numeraries the associates do not live in Opus Dei centers but maintain their own abodes.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Some of their family life (emotional and social support) comes from the centers of Opus Dei, some from other associates of Opus Dei, and some from their personal families and friends; the precise ratio of this distribution depends upon the circumstances of the individual associate.  

The '''[[Types of membership of Opus Dei|Clergy of the Opus Dei Prelature]]''' are priests who are under the jurisdiction of the Prelate of Opus Dei. They are a minority in Opus Dei—only about 2% of Opus Dei members are part of the clergy.&lt;ref name="TRIBUNE"/&gt; Typically, they are numeraries or associates who ultimately joined the priesthood.

The '''[[Opus Dei: Priestly Society of the Holy Cross|Priestly Society of the Holy Cross]]''' consists of priests associated with Opus Dei. Part of the society is made up of the clergy of the Opus Dei prelature—priests who fall under the jurisdiction of the Opus Dei prelature are automatically members of the Priestly Society. Other members in the society are diocesan priests—clergymen who remain under the jurisdiction of a geographically defined diocese. These priests are considered full members of Opus Dei who are given its spiritual training. They do not however report to the Opus Dei Prelate but to their own diocesan bishop.&lt;ref name=ODinChurch&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Pedro Rodríguez |author2=Fernando Ocariz |author3=José Luis Illanes | title=Opus Dei in the Church|publisher=Scepter |year=2003|isbn= 1-889334-93-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, there were roughly two thousand of these priests.&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOK"/&gt;

The '''[[Types of membership of Opus Dei|Cooperators of Opus Dei]]''' are non-members who collaborate in some way with Opus Dei—usually through praying, charitable contributions, or by providing some other assistance. Cooperators are not required to be celibate or to adhere to any other special requirements. Indeed, cooperators are not even required to be Christian.&lt;ref name=ODinChurch/&gt; There were 164,000 cooperators in the year 2005.&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOK"/&gt;

In accordance with Catholic theology, membership is granted when a [[vocation]], or divine calling is presumed to have occurred.

Its lay people and priests organize seminars, workshops, retreats, and classes to help people put the Christian faith into practice in their daily lives. [[Spiritual direction]], one-on-one coaching with a more experienced lay person or priest, is considered the "paramount means" of training. Through these activities they provide religious instruction (doctrinal formation), coaching in spirituality for lay people (spiritual formation), character and moral education (human formation), lessons in sanctifying one's work (professional formation), and know-how in evangelizing one's family and workplace (apostolic formation).

The official Catholic document which established the prelature states that Opus Dei strives "to put into practice the teaching of the universal call to sanctity, and to promote at all levels of society the sanctification of ordinary work, and by means of ordinary work."&lt;ref name="UTSIT"/&gt; Thus, the founder and his followers describe members of Opus Dei as resembling the members of the early Christian Church—ordinary workers who seriously sought holiness with nothing exterior to distinguish them from other citizens.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://lukeraid.tripod.com/opusdei/id19.html | work=Opus Dei: A Dialogue Between Friend and Foe | title=St. Liguori et Als on vocation and Opus Dei | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://en.romana.org/?s=8.0&amp;n=29&amp;ID=1 | work=Romana: The Official Bulletin of Opus Dei | title=The Example of the Early Christians in Blessed Josemaria's Teachings | author=Domingo Ramos-Lissón | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opus Dei runs residential centers throughout the world. These centers provide residential housing for celibate members, and provide doctrinal and theological education. Opus Dei is also responsible for a variety of non-profit institutions called "[[Opus Dei in society|Corporate Works of Opus Dei]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://opusdeisites.tripod.com/ | title=Opus Dei Corporate Works | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the year 2005, showed that members have cooperated with other people in setting up a total of 608 social initiatives: schools and university residences (68%), technical or agricultural training centers (26%), universities, business schools and hospitals (6%).&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOK"/&gt; The [[University of Navarra]] in Pamplona, Spain or the Austral University in Buenos Aires, Argentina are both examples of the corporate work of Opus Dei.

==Relations with Catholic leaders==
{{Main article|Opus Dei and Catholic Church leaders}}

Leopoldo Eijo y Garay, the bishop of Madrid where Opus Dei was born, supported Opus Dei and defended it in the 1940s by saying that "this ''opus'' is truly ''Dei''" (this work is truly God's). Contrary to attacks of secrecy and heresy, the bishop described Opus Dei's founder as someone who is "open as a child" and "most obedient to the Church hierarchy".&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez de Prada, Andrés, ''The Founder of Opus Dei: The life of Josemaría Escrivá, Volume 1: The early years,'' New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:JohannesPaul2-portrait.jpg|thumb|St. [[Pope John Paul II]]: Opus Dei was founded "led by divine inspiration"]]
In the 1950s, Pope Pius XII told the most senior Australian bishop, Cardinal [[Norman Gilroy]] that Escrivá "is a true saint, a man sent by God for our times".&lt;ref&gt;[Jose Manuel Cerda, Like a bridge over troubled waters in Sydney: Warrane College and the student protests of 1970, Studia et Documenta 4(2010) 147–181 http://warrane.unsw.edu.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=81]&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII gave Opus Dei the canonical status of "[[pontifical right]]", an institution depending directly and exclusively on the Vatican in its internal governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opusdeitoday.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=428|title=24 February 1947 - Granting of the 'decretum laudis' • Opus Dei today|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, [[Pope John XXIII]] commented that Opus Dei opens up "unsuspected horizons of [[wikt:apostolate|apostolate]]".&lt;ref name="OFFICIAL_PAPAL"/&gt; Furthermore, in 1964, [[Pope Paul VI]] praised the organization in a handwritten letter to Escrivá, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Opus Dei is "a vigorous expression of the perennial youth of the Church, fully open to the demands of a modern apostolate... We look with paternal satisfaction on all that Opus Dei has achieved and is achieving for the kingdom of God, the desire of doing good that guides it, the burning love for the Church and its visible head that distinguishes it, and the ardent zeal for souls that impels it along the arduous and difficult paths of the apostolate of presence and witness in every sector of contemporary life."&lt;ref name="OFFICIAL_PAPAL"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The relationship between Paul VI and Opus Dei, according to Alberto Moncada, a doctor of sociology and ex-member, was "stormy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.takingfive.com/ethics_opusdei.htm | work=TakingFive.com | author=Ruth Bertels | title=The Ethics of Opus Dei | accessdate=27 November 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830191112/http://www.takingfive.com/ethics_opusdei.htm | archivedate=30 August 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second Vatican Council]] concluded in 1965, Pope Paul VI denied Opus Dei's petition to become a personal prelature, Moncada stated.&lt;ref name="OpusOverTime"&gt;

[[Pope John Paul I]], a few years before his election, wrote that Escrivá was more radical than other saints who taught about the [[universal call to holiness]]. While others emphasized monastic spirituality applied to lay people, for Escrivá "it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity", thus providing a lay spirituality.&lt;ref name=Luciani&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabriel.mps.ohio-state.edu/od/opus.see |author=Cardinal Albino Luciani (John Paul I) |work=Opus Dei Files |title=Seeking God Through Everyday Work: A profile of the Founder of Opus Dei, Josemaria Escriva |accessdate=3 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311125047/http://gabriel.mps.ohio-state.edu/od/opus.see |archivedate=11 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Controversies about Opus Dei|Criticisms against Opus Dei]] have prompted Catholic scholars and writers like [[Piers Paul Read]]&lt;ref name=Piers&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/10/23/boall23.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=You can trust them to sell you a car | accessdate=27 November 2006 | location=London | date=23 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vittorio Messori]] to call Opus Dei a [[sign of contradiction]], in reference to the biblical quote of Jesus as a "sign that is spoken against".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theuniversityconcourse.com/I,1,2-13-1996/Gordon.htm |work=The University Concourse |author=Richard Gordon |title=What is Opus Dei, and what role does it play at Franciscan University? |accessdate=27 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111112830/http://www.theuniversityconcourse.com/I%2C1%2C2-13-1996/Gordon.htm |archivedate=11 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Said [[John Carmel Heenan]], Cardinal [[Archbishop of Westminster]]: "One of the proofs of God's favor is to be a sign of contradiction.

One of Opus Dei's most prominent supporters was Pope [[John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Opus_Dei | work=Sourcewatch.org | title=Opus Dei | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Paul II cited Opus Dei's aim of sanctifying secular activities as a "great ideal." He emphasized that Escrivá's founding of Opus Dei was ''ductus divina inspiratione,'' led by divine inspiration, and he granted the organization its status as a personal prelature.&lt;ref name="UTSIT2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CBISUTSI.HTM | author=Pope John Paul II | title=Ut Sit | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stating that Escrivá is "counted among the great witnesses of Christianity," John Paul II canonized him in 2002, and called him "the saint of ordinary life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=14246 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=St. Josemaría's Canonisation | accessdate=27 November 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005002542/http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=14246 | archivedate=5 October 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the organization, John Paul II said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Opus Dei] has as its aim the sanctification of one's life, while remaining within the world at one's place of work and profession: to live the Gospel in the world, while living immersed in the world, but in order to transform it, and to redeem it with one's personal love for Christ. This is truly a great ideal, which right from the beginning has anticipated the theology of the lay state of the [[Second Vatican Council]] and the post-conciliar period.&lt;ref name="OFFICIALFOCUS"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&amp;p=9319 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Opus Dei's focus on secular life | accessdate=2006-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One-third of the world's [[bishop]]s petitioned for the [[Canonization of Josemaría Escrivá|canonization of Escrivá]]. During the canonization, there were 42 [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and 470 bishops from around the world, [[general superior|generals superior]] of many [[religious institute]]s, and representatives of various Catholic groups. During those days, these Church officials commented on the universal reach and validity of the message of the founder.&lt;ref name="MESSORI"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Messori, Vittorio| title=Opus Dei, Leadership and Vision in Today's Catholic Church | publisher=Regnery Publishing | year=1997 | isbn=0-89526-450-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his canonization [[homily]], John Paul II said: With the teachings of St. Josemaría, "it is easier to understand what the Second Vatican Council affirmed: 'there is no question, then, of the Christian message inhibiting men from building up the world ... on the contrary it is an incentive to do these very things' (Vatican II, ''[[Gaudium et spes]],'' n. 34)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20021006_escriva_en.html| work=Vatican Official site| title=Canonization of St. Josemaria Escriva: Homily of John Paul II| accessdate=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the group's role in the Catholic Church, critics have argued that Opus Dei's unique status as a personal prelature gives it too much independence, making it essentially a "church within a church" and that Opus Dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within the Catholic Church itself,&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; as illustrated, for example, by the unusually rapid [[Josemaría Escrivá: Canonisation|canonization of Escrivá]], which some considered to be irregular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0510.baumann.html |work=Washington Monthly |title=Let There Be Light: A look inside the hidden world of Opus Dei |author=Paul Baumann |accessdate=27 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829105702/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0510.baumann.html |archivedate=29 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Catholic officials say that Church authorities have even greater control of Opus Dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by the Pope,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=20829 | work=Opus Dei website | author=Francesco Monterisi | title=The Personal Prelature: a Framework which Enriches the Communion of the Church | accessdate=17 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its status as a prelature "precisely means dependence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zenit.org/article-22167?l=english |work=Zenit News Agency |author=Miriam Díez i Bosch |title=Opus Dei Opens its Doors to Everyone: Interview With the Vicar General of the Personal Prelature |accessdate=2 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412003434/http://www.zenit.org/article-22167?l=english |archivedate=12 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen says that Escriva's relatively quick canonization does not have anything to do with power but with improvements in procedures and John Paul II's decision to make Escriva's sanctity and message known.&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOK"/&gt;

Pope [[Benedict XVI]] has been a particularly strong supporter of Opus Dei and of Escrivá. Pointing to the name "Work of God", Benedict XVI (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger), wrote that "The Lord simply made use of [Escrivá] who allowed God to work." Ratzinger cited Escrivá for correcting the mistaken idea that holiness is reserved to some extraordinary people who are completely different from ordinary sinners: Even if he can be very weak, with many mistakes in his life, a saint is nothing other than to speak with God as a friend speaks with a friend, allowing God to work, the Only One who can really make the world both good and happy.

Ratzinger spoke of Opus Dei's "surprising union of absolute fidelity to the Church's great tradition, to its faith, and unconditional openness to all the challenges of this world, whether in the academic world, in the field of work, or in matters of the economy, etc."&lt;ref name="BENEDICTONESCRIVA"/&gt; He further explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the theocentrism of Escrivá ... means this confidence in the fact that God is working now and we ought only to put ourselves at his disposal ... This, for me, is a message of greatest importance. It is a message that leads to overcoming what could be considered the great temptation of our times: the pretense that after the '[[Big Bang]]' God retired from history.&lt;ref name="BENEDICTONESCRIVA"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] is "the first Pope who has dealt with Opus Dei closely as a bishop",&lt;ref name="opusdei.org.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opusdei.org.au/en-au/article/interview-with-mariano-fazio-2/|title=Interview with Vicar General of Opus Dei|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to James V.

==Controversy==
{{Main article|Controversies about Opus Dei}}

Throughout its history, Opus Dei has been criticized from many quarters, prompting journalists to describe Opus Dei as "the most controversial force in the Catholic Church" and founder Saint [[Josemaría Escrivá]] as a "polarizing" figure.&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOK"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Noam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Feb2006/books.asp | work=American Catholic | author=Brennan Hill | title=Who Stood For and Against Hitler? | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of Opus Dei has centered on allegations of secretiveness,&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; controversial and aggressive [[apostolate|recruiting methods]], strict rules governing members, elitism and [[misogyny]], and support of or participation in authoritarian or right-wing governments, especially the [[Spain under Franco|Francoist]] Government of Spain until 1978.&lt;ref name = "OpusOverTime"/&gt; The [[mortification of the flesh]] practiced by some of its members is also criticized. Opus Dei has also been criticized for allegedly seeking independence and more influence within the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{Cite book| author=Michael Walsh | title=Opus Dei: An Investigation into the Powerful Secretive Society within the Catholic Church.| year=2004 | publisher=Harper San Francisco| isbn=0-06-075068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the other hand, according to several journalists who researched Opus Dei separately, many criticisms against Opus Dei are based on fabrications by opponents,&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whitehouse"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Opus Dei: The Truth Behind the Myth| author=Maggy Whitehouse| publisher=Hermes House|year=2006| isbn=0-681-35584-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Noam&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article575959.ece | title=What Is Opus Dei?

In recent years, Opus Dei has received international attention due to the novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and its [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film version of 2006]], both of which prominent Christians and non-believers criticized as misleading, [[Inaccuracies in The Da Vinci Code#Opus Dei|inaccurate]] and [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Da Vinci Hoax: Exposing the Errors in The Da Vinci Code |author1=Carl Olson  |author2=Sandra Miesel  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Ignatius Press |isbn= 978-1-58617-034-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davincicon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Laura |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E0DD103AF931A15751C0A9629C8B63 |title=THE LAST WORD; The Da Vinci Con – New York Times |publisher=Query.nytimes.com |date=22 February 2004 |accessdate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Critics such as the Jesuit [[Wlodimir Ledóchowski|Wladimir Ledóchowski]] sometimes refer to Opus Dei as a "Catholic", "christian", or "white" form of [[Freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/t/tapia-threshold.html|title=Beyond the Threshold|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14586560|title=The triumph of democracy in Spain|last=1946-|first=Preston, Paul,|date=1986|publisher=Methuen|year=|isbn=9780416900101|location=London|pages=28|oclc=14586560}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/78244509|title=Secret societies|last=1964-|first=Harding, Nick,|date=2005|publisher=Chartwell Books, Inc|year=|isbn=9780785821700|location=Edison, N.J.|pages=107|oclc=78244509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Hesse, Alexander|Title=Geheimbünde Freimaurer und Illuminaten, Opus Dei und Schwarze Hand|Publisher=Rowohlt Taschenbuch|PublicationPlace=Reinbek|At=p.&amp;nbsp;54|ISBN=9783499630491|Date=2015|language=German

&lt;!-- Note that this is an entirely objective, multi-sourced fact, and to omit it is to leave open the possibility of misunderstanding from simply reading this introduction that it is a reliable source of information about Opus Dei; the sources above are just some of the many more good ones I'm sure are readily available. The book "The Da Vinci Hoax" is/was strongly promoted by Fr. Mitch Pacwa, S.J., who hosts the weekly flagship programme EWTN Live on the EWTN catholic Cable TV network and also hosts "Threshold of Hope", a program which studies the encyclicals of Pope John Paul II. Dr. Scott Hahn, and Fr. Richard John Neuhaus are other authors who I think will yield good citations. The journal First Things of which Fr. Neuhaus was editor-in-chief until his recent death surely includes some critical commentary of this type. Update: in fact, going to www.firstthings.com and entering "Da Vinci Code" in the search box brings up tens of articles, a couple of which I have cited, one of which makes particular mention of Opus Dei: "Opus Dei has some experience with being caricatured, as in The Da Vinci Code." Fact; prominent orthodox Catholics take strong issue with Brown's book and its portrayal of Opus Dei. --&gt;

According to several journalists who have worked independently on Opus Dei, such as [[John Allen, Jr.]],&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOK"/&gt; [[Vittorio Messori]],&lt;ref name="MESSORI"/&gt; [[Patrice de Plunkett]],&lt;ref name="Plunkett"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-12784?l=french |work=[[Zenit News Agency]] |title=Entretien avec l’auteur de L’Opus Dei – Enquête sur le " monstre " |author=Patrice de Plunkett |accessdate=20 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210339/http://www.zenit.org/article-12784?l=french |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maggy Whitehouse]],&lt;ref name="whitehouse"/&gt; [[Noam Friedlander]]&lt;ref name="Noam"/&gt; many of the criticisms against Opus Dei are myths and unproven tales.&lt;ref name="DAILYRECORD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2300685.stm | work=BBC News | title=The rise of Opus Dei | author=Peter Gould | accessdate=27 November 2006 | date=4 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PBSNEWSWEEKLY&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week444/cover.html | author=Kim Lawton | work=PBS Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly |date=29 June 2001 | title=Opus Dei | accessdate=28 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen, Messori, and Plunkett say that most of these myths were created by its opponents, with Allen adding that he perceives that Opus Dei members generally practise what they preach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldarchive.godspy.com/reviews/Opus-Dei-An-Interview-with-John-Allen-by-John-Romanowsky.cfm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713161854/http://oldarchive.godspy.com/reviews/Opus-Dei-An-Interview-with-John-Allen-by-John-Romanowsky.cfm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 July 2012 |work=Gospy |title=Unveiling Opus Dei: Interview with John L.

[[Image:Opusdeicentralhqrome.jpg|thumb|right|Opus Dei central headquarters in Rome]]
Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also state that accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations stem from a [[clericalism|clerical paradigm]] which expects Opus Dei members to behave as monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst [[John L. Allen, Jr.]] states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei can be found in influential clerical circles.&lt;ref name=MESSORI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theamericanmag.com/article.php?show_issue_id=24&amp;show_article_id=320 | work=The American | author=Edward Pentin | title=Profiles: John Allen | accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODanticult/&gt;

As to its alleged participation in right-wing politics, especially the Francoist regime, distinguished British historians [[Paul Preston]] and [[Brian Crozier]] state that the Opus Dei members who were Franco's ministers were appointed for their talent and not for their Opus Dei membership.&lt;ref name="PRESTON"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, Brian, ''Franco, A Biographical History'', Little, Brown and Company 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"the technocrats 'were appointed to high office not because of what they were [i.e. Opus Dei members] but because of what they wanted to do.'

Opus Dei is not "elitist" in the sense in which people often invoke the term, meaning an exclusively white-collar phenomenon, concluded John Allen. He observed that among its members are barbers, bricklayers, mechanics and fruit sellers. Most supernumeraries are living ordinary middle-class lives, he said.&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOK"/&gt;

Regarding alleged [[misogyny]], John Allen states that half of the leadership positions in Opus Dei are held by women, and they supervise men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/tall-tale-ignites-an-overdue-debate/2006/05/17/1147545387121.html?page=2 | title=Tall tale ignites an overdue debate | author=Julia Baird | accessdate=4 April 2007 | date=18 May 2006 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church defends its male priesthood by saying that "the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven are not the ministers but the saints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ourladyswarriors.org/teach/inteinsi.htm | title=''Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood (Inter Insigniores)'' | author=Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Approved for Publication by His Holiness Pope Paul VI | year=1976 | accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Critics of Opus Dei include María del Carmen Tapia, an ex-member who was a high-ranking officer of Opus Dei for many years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=María del Carmen Tapia | title=Beyond the Threshold: A Life in Opus Dei | publisher=Continuum Publishing Company | year=1997 | isbn=0-8264-1096-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; liberal Catholic theologians such as Fr. [[James Martin (Jesuit writer)|James Martin]], a [[Jesuit]] writer and editor, and supporters of [[Liberation theology]], such as journalist [[Penny Lernoux]] and Michael Walsh, a writer on religious matters and former Jesuit.&lt;ref name="TRIBUNE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper=Financial Times (London) | author=Leslie Crawford | title=Opus Dei's influence promotes a sainthood | date=6 October 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics state that Opus Dei is "intensely secretive"—for example, members generally do not disclose their affiliation with Opus Dei in public. Further, under the 1950 constitution, members were expressly forbidden to reveal themselves without the permission of their superiors.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; This practice has led to much speculation about who may be a member.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; Due in part to its secrecy, ''Jesuit America'' magazine referred to it as, "....the most controversial group in the Catholic Church today.&lt;ref name=Jesuit&gt;[https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2012/12/13/opus-dei-united-states-february-25-1995 Opus Dei in the United States], ''[[America Magazine]]'', James Martin, 25 February 1995. Retrieved 22 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opus Dei has been accused of deceptive and aggressive recruitment practices,&lt;ref name=Jesuit /&gt; such as showering potential members with intense praise ("[[Love bombing]]"),&lt;ref name="DAILYRECORD"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/14640/opus-dei-members-da-vinci-distorted | work=Daily Record | title=Opus Dei members: 'Da Vinci' distorted | author=Abbott Karloff|date=14 May 2006 | accessdate=27 November 2006}} ''mirrored on ReligionNewsBlog.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=347479 | title=Opening the doors of Opus Dei: Part 2| author=Elizabeth W. Green | work=The Harvard Crimson | date=10 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instructing numeraries to form friendships and attend social gatherings explicitly for recruiting purposes.&lt;ref name="AMERICA"/&gt;

Critics allege that Opus Dei maintains an extremely high degree of control over its members—for instance, past rules required numeraries to submit their incoming and outgoing mail to their superiors for inspection, and members are forbidden to read certain books without permission from their superiors.&lt;ref name="DAILYRECORD"/&gt; Critics charge that Opus Dei pressures numeraries to sever contact with non-members, including their own families.&lt;ref name="DAILYRECORD"/&gt; Exit counselor David Clark has described Opus Dei as "very cult-like".&lt;ref name="DAILYRECORD"/&gt;

[[File:Antonio Fontan press freedom hero.JPG|thumb|150px|right|[[Antonio Fontán]], Spanish journalist and member of Opus Dei who fought for the freedom of press and democracy during Franco's regime. He was persecuted by Franco and was elected as the first President of the Senate once democracy was restored.]]

Critics assert that Escrivá and the organization supported radical right-wing governments, such as those of Franco, [[Augusto Pinochet]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} and [[Alberto Fujimori]] of Peru during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, John, Jr. ''Opus Dei, The Truth about its Rituals, Secrets and Power'', 2005, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0-14-102465-8}}, pp 287–290&lt;/ref&gt; Both Pinochet's and Fujimori's ministries and prominent supporters allegedly included members of Opus Dei, but there are also prominent Opus Dei members in parties that opposed those governments. Likewise, among Opus Dei members there were also strong detractors of Franco, such as Antonio Fontán.  There have also been allegations that Escrivá expressed sympathy for [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/04/14/sain.php |work=International Herald Tribune |author=Barry James |title=Rocky Road to Sainthood for a 'Choleric' Cleric |date=14 April 1992 |accessdate=28 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410185512/http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/04/14/sain.php |archivedate=10 April 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Catholics scrutinize enigmatic, strict Opus Dei. | author=Ron Grossman |date=6 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One former Opus Dei priest, Vladimir Felzmann, who has become a vocal Opus Dei critic, says that Escrivá once remarked that Hitler had been "badly treated" by the world and he further declared that "Hitler couldn't have been such a bad person.

Opus Dei has also been accused of [[elitism]] through targeting of "the intellectual elite, the well-to-do, and the socially prominent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/reviews/beyondthethreshold.htm |author=Paul Baumann|date=10 August 1997 | work=The Washington Post| title=The Way of the Faithful}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As members of Opus Dei are Catholics, Opus Dei has been subjected to the same criticisms targeted to Catholicism in general. For example, Opus Dei's position has been "to oppose  sexual freedoms and promote conservative morals," according to an investigative report produced by the advocacy group [[Catholics for Choice]].&lt;ref name="CFC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/oppositionwatch/documents/OpusDeiinLatinAmerica.pdf | title=A Primer on Opus Dei in Latin America | author=Catholics for Choice | year=2011 | accessdate=23 October 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531231642/http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/oppositionwatch/documents/OpusDeiinLatinAmerica.pdf | archivedate=31 May 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report further cites a study from sociologist Marco Burgos alleging Opus Dei interference in sex education programs in Honduras that contradict the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name="BURGOS"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/652527.html | title=Culpan a Opus Dei por golpe en Honduras | date=18 January 2010 | work=El Universal | accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After conducting a critical study of Opus Dei, Catholic journalist [[John L. Allen, Jr.]] concluded that Opus Dei should (1) be more transparent, (2) collaborate with members of [[religious institute]]s, and (3) encourage its members to air out in public their criticisms of the institution.&lt;ref name="ALLENBOOK"/&gt;

===Other views===
Sociologists [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]] and [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] suggest that Opus Dei is involved in "a deliberate attempt to construct an alternative modernity," one that engages modern culture while at the same time is resolutely loyal to Catholic traditions.&lt;ref name=berger&gt;{{Cite book| title=Many Globalizations: Cultural Diversity in the Contemporary World |author1=Peter Berger  |author2=Samuel Huntington |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002| isbn=84-493-1322-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Biema of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine emphasises Opus Dei's Spanish roots as a source of misunderstandings in the [[Anglo-Saxon]] world, and suggests that as the United States becomes more Hispanic, controversies about Opus Dei (and similar Catholic organizations) will decrease.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt;

In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, [[Maggy Whitehouse]], a non-Catholic journalist, argues that the relative autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced the issues raised by ''The Da Vinci Code'' and other critics.&lt;ref name="whitehouse"/&gt;

==Opus Dei in popular culture==
* [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s 1974 [[Science Fiction]] story "Enforcer"&lt;ref&gt;Among the stories included in Pournelle's "[[High Justice]]"&lt;/ref&gt; centers on a fictional coup d'état in [[Argentina]], whose moving spirit, a Colonel Ortiz, is affiliated to Opus Dei as well as [[Catholic Action]]. Though he is the story's [[antagonist]], Otiz is depicted rather sympathetically as an honest and dedicated officer - who tries (and eventually fails) to defend Argentine sovereignty against a giant multi-national corporation employing the "Enforcer" of the title.
* In the 1997 novel ''The Genesis Code'' by [[John Case (novelist)|John Case]] the leader of Umbra Domini, which is the author's version of Opus Dei, is portrayed as the novel's [[antagonist]]. In the novel, Umbra Domini members are sent on a mission to execute children who were conceived using genetically engineered [[oocyte]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* In another 1997 book, the detective novel "The Death of Faith" which is the seventh in the ''Commissario Brunetti'' series by [[Donna Leon]], the book's mystery turns out to involve sinister activities by Opus Dei. The book ends with the protagonist Brunetti feeling certain that a priest who is an Opus Dei member was responsible for several murders - but has no way to prove it in court, and feels that Opus Dei is too powerful to touch.    
* Since 2003, Opus Dei has received world attention as a result of [[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and the 2006 [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film based on the novel]]. In ''The Da Vinci Code'', Opus Dei is portrayed as a Catholic organization that is led into a sinister international conspiracy.&lt;ref name="NCRDAVINCI"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004c/091004/091004p.php|work=National Catholic Reporter | title=Opus Dei and The Da Vinci Code | author=Nicole Zarayn | accessdate=27 November 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060819163608/http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004c/091004/091004p.php |archivedate = 19 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, ''The Da Vinci Code'' has been sharply criticized for its numerous factual inaccuracies, by a wide array of scholars and historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2003/03/27/da_vinci/index.html |title=The Da Vinci Code" by Dan Brown |author=Charles Taylor |date=27 February 2003 |work=Salon.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711100600/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2003/03/27/da_vinci/index.html |archivedate=11 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Ehrman | first=Bart | title=Truth and Fiction in The Da Vinci Code: A Historian Reveals What We Really Know about Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Constantine | isbn=978-0-19-518140-1 | publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |date=1 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Bishop of Durham]], the [[N.

'''Philosophical theology''' is both a branch and form of [[theology]] in which [[philosophy|philosophical]] methods are used in developing or analyzing theological concepts. It therefore includes [[natural theology]] as well as philosophical treatments of [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] and [[heterodox]] theology. Philosophical theology is also closely related to the [[philosophy of religion]].

== Definitions ==
[[Mortimer J. Adler]] distinguishes philosophical theology from [[natural theology]]. While the former is, according to him, theology done by non-Christian philosophers, the latter is done by those who are already Christians and are actually trying to find rational proofs for their faith.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, "A Philosopher's Religious Faith," in Kelly J. Clark (ed), ''Philosophers Who Believe'' (Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 1993), 205-207&lt;/ref&gt; Adler thinks that the term "natural theology" is a misnomer and is actually apologetics, and cites as an example Thomas Aquinas' ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', addressed to the Jews and Moors in Spain, which though written as if it were philosophical theology, was in fact, apologetics and not philosophical theology, as it was written by a Christian and not by a pagan. In Adler's view, few if any of the books on natural theology, are sound as works in philosophical theology, because they are not written by pagans.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, "A Philosopher's Religious Faith," in Kelly J. Clark (ed), ''Philosophers Who Believe'', 207&lt;/ref&gt; An example of philosophical theology, according to Adler, is Aristotle's theology as found in his ''Metaphysics.''&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, "A Philosopher's Religious Faith," in Kelly J. Clark (ed), ''Philosophers Who Believe'', 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Adler's view, Charles Taliaferro and Chad Meister think that doing philosophical theology may not be restricted by whether the doer is an insider to faith or not, for anyone doing philosophical theology only tries to consider whether a theological doctrine can make philosophical sense or not.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taliaferro and Chad Meister, ''Contemporary Philosophical Theology'' (Routledge, 2016) {{ISBN|9781317294429}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, as Adler points it out, a pagan doing philosophical theology and coming to a theological conclusion has a different route than an insider using philosophy to examine or seek to understand his faith.

== Philosophy and theology ==
The relationship between theology and philosophy has been long-debated and discussed with the [[Christian tradition]]. [[Tertullian]], an influential early Christian theologian and apologist, believed that philosophy has little to do with theology, arguing that the use of philosophy often corrupted theology, leading to unorthodox beliefs that were not grounded in the early Christian tradition. He famously asked the question 'What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?'. ([[Athens]] symbolized the philosophical approach because of its role as a leading center of [[Hellenistic philosophy]], while [[Jerusalem]] represented Christianity because of its role as an important location and intellectual centre in the [[early church]].) Other leaders, however, saw a closer relationship between philosophy and theology. [[Justin Martyr]] looked at people like [[Heraclitus]] and [[Socrates]] as possessing the divine light of revelation and believed them to be true philosophers. Justin saw Christianity as the True Philosophy and argued for Christianity using philosophical methods and terminology. [[St. Augustine]], who became one of the most influential theologians in history and whose works laid the foundation for much of Western philosophy (as well as much of Western theology), espoused a more middle-of-the-road, moderate approach, arguing that philosophy and theology often complement each other while at the same time cautioning that philosophy should not always be used in theological discourse. Instead, he argued, one should make sure that a philosophical approach toward a particular issue was grounded in prior Christian commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/christiantheology-philosophy/|title= Philosophy and Christian Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The disciplines of Philosophy and Theology have often been connected, with theologians and philosophers interacting and debating similar and sometimes overlapping issues. Philosophy played a key role in the formation of Western theology. [[Thomas Aquinas]], one of the most influential philosophers and theologians in history, for instance, borrowed much of his concepts from [[Aristotle]]. [[Scholasticism]] dominated both the philosophical and theological landscape in the [[Middle Ages]], with theologians such as Aquinas, [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Peter Abelard]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Albertus Magnus]] playing key role in both philosophy and theology.

In modern times, [[Anthony Thiselton]] has shown in his ''Fusion of Horizons'' the role that philosophy has played in the interpretation of scriptures, i.e., in the field of [[hermeneutics]]. Philosophy provides interpretive grids for apprehension of revelation. There are others, like [[Sadhu Sundar Singh]], for instance, who believed that it is the illumination of the [[Holy Spirit]] that gives the truest meaning of revelation. Yet, one can't fail to see that cultural grids play an important role in the development of theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/christiantheology-philosophy/|title= Philosophy and Christian Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contemporary philosophers continue to write and argue from a Christian perspective, with Christian concepts undergirding their philosophical work. In recent decades some of the most well-known philosophers who have written from a Christian perspective are [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[William Lane Craig]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[Paul Tillich]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Richard Swinburne]], and [[James K. A. Smith]].

==Foundations of modern philosophical theology==
During the 18th, 19th centuries, and 20th centuries many theologians reacted against the [[modernism|modernist]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and [[logical positivism|positivist]] attacks on [[Christian theology]]. Some [[Christian existentialism|existentialistic]] or [[neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] intellectuals like the [[Swiss Reformed Church|Swiss Reformed]] theologian [[Karl Barth]] turned away from philosophy (called [[fideism]]) and argued that faith should be based strictly upon divine revelation. A popular approach in some circles is the approach of [[Reformed epistemology|Reformed epistemologists]], such as [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]], who assert that belief in God might be [[foundationalism|foundational]] (or, properly [[basic belief|'basic']]) and warranted without the need for logical or evidential justification, like belief in [[problem of other minds|other minds]] or the [[philosophical skepticism|external world]], rather than inferentially derived from other beliefs; it can, however, be subject to [[defeater]]s, rationally requiring that one give up the belief. Many other philosophers and theologians, however, disagree with this perspective and provide alternative views. Many other theologians have turned to [[continental philosophy]], [[analytic philosophy]], and [[postmodern philosophy]] in attempts to analyze and reframe the Christian theology in contemporary contexts.

== Philosophical theology ==
While philosophical theology can denote an approach to theology which is philosophical in nature, it can also denote a specific area of theology in which philosophical methods and terminology are used to analyze theological concepts. One task of philosophical theologians is to attempt to reconcile certain aspects of Christian doctrine with developments in philosophy. One question concerns how to prove the existence and nature of God. The knowledge of God is dealt with in the [[epistemology]] of [[religion]]. There are many different perspectives with philosophical theology on such questions. In modern times [[process theology]], [[open theism]] and [[Panentheism#Panentheism in Christianity|Christian panentheism]] have tried to look at God as the Being who is not only the Source and Ground of all being but also influenced by the people and processes of the world which he created and to which he belongs—rejecting or at least amending the classical medieval doctrine of [[impassibility]].

== Christology ==
Within [[Christology]], a number of philosophical questions have been raised, such as how the divine can incarnate as a human, how the eternal can enter the temporal, and how the divine and the human can be united in one yet remain distinct. Such questions led to earlier [[heresies]] like [[Arianism]], [[Sabellianism]], [[Docetism]], etc. Often, one's [[Epistemology|epistemic theory]] can play an important role in how one answers such questions. There is, for instance, sometimes a clash between those who want to emphasize the [[rational]] foundation for theology and those who want to emphasize the [[empirical]] foundation for theology. There has also been a contrast made between Christology from above and Christology from below. The former emphasizes the divine side of [[Christ]]; the latter, the human side. The human side obviously tends to look at it more empirically. The Scriptures call the Incarnation as a mystery of godliness.&lt;ref&gt;1 Tim. 3: 16.&lt;/ref&gt; It baffles human imagination, leading many to call it a divine mystery. Yet, philosophical theologians argue that it is also important to find a philosophical ground for asserting both the divinity and humanity of Christ. Others theologians, however, like [[Rudolph Bultmann]], ventured to remove any myths from the Bible, a hermeneutical approach they called [[demythology]]. They have therefore looked at the [[New Testament]] Christology as greatly tampered with and in need of being demythologized. There has been a separation made between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith (see also the [[Quest for the Historical Jesus]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3755">'''Rational fideism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view that considers [[faith]] to be precursor for any reliable [[knowledge]]. Whether one considers [[rationalism]] or [[empiricism]], either of them ultimately tends to ''[[belief]]'' in [[reason]] or [[experience]] respectively as the absolute basis for their methods. Thus, faith is basic to knowability.

== Definitions ==
"Rational fideism" has been defined variously. The following are some definitions.

For [[Joseph Glanvill]] rational fideism is the view that "Faith, and faith alone, is the basis for our belief in our reason. We believe in our reason because we believe in God's veracity. We do not try to prove that God is truthful; we believe this. Thus, faith in God gives us faith in reason, which in turn "justifies" our belief that God is no deceiver."&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Popkin, ''The History of Scepticism,'' Oxford University Press, 2003, p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Popkin]] sees rational fideism as the opposite of "pure, blind, fideism".&lt;ref&gt;Ira O.Wade, ''Intellectual Origins of the French Enlightenment,'' Princeton University Press, 1971, p.552&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Domenic Marbaniang sees rational fideism as "the view that the knowledge of God can be certified through faith alone that is based on a revelation that is rationally verified." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Marbaniang |first=Domenic |year=2007 |institution=ACTS Academy of Higher Education |title=Epistemics of Divine Reality }}&lt;/ref&gt; Observing that the way of both [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]] towards the knowledge of ultimate or transcendent reality is bleak, he thinks that while [[fideism]] is the view that truth in religion rests solely on faith and not on a reasoning process, rational fideism "holds that truth in religion rests solely on faith; not blind faith, but faith that can give rational and cogent answers or reason to warrant the belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Marbaniang |first=Domenic |year=2007 |institution=ACTS Academy of Higher Education |title=Epistemics of Divine Reality }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[C. Stephen Evans]], rational fideism involves the possibility of reason becoming self-critical. Seeing it as the kind of responsible fideism, he states, "If human reason has limitations and also has some ability to recognise those limitations, then the possibility of responsible fideism emerges."&lt;ref&gt;C. Stephen Evans, ''Faith Beyond Reason,'' Edinburgh University Press, 1998, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Evans states that not only does reason have limitations, it is also tainted by sin making one entitled to faith where reason fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Butcher |first=Matthew |year=2013 |institution=Loyola University  |title=Fideism, Evidentialism, and the Epistemology of Religious Belief|url=https://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1507&amp;context=luc_diss }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Patrick J. Clarke defines rational fidesm as the approach that sees "reason as capable of providing the intellectual foundation of faith, not ''a priori'' but ''a posteriori'', much as philosophy provides an intellectual foundation to theology.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Clarke, ''Examining Philosophy and Ethics,'' Nelson Thomes, 2002. p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relevance theory''' is framework for understanding utterance interpretation first proposed by [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Deirdre Wilson]] and used within cognitive linguistics and pragmatics. It was originally inspired by the work of [[Paul Grice|H. Paul Grice]] and developed out of his ideas, but has since become a pragmatic framework in its own right.

== Contrasted with the conduit metaphor==
There are two ways to conceive of how thoughts are communicated from one person to another. The first way is through 
the use of strict coding and decoding (such as is used with [[Morse code]]), also known as the [[Shannon-Weaver_model]]. In this approach the speaker/author encodes 
their thoughts and transmits them to their audience. The audience receives the encoded message and decodes it to arrive at the meaning the speaker/author intended. This can be visualized as follows:

 Speaker's thought/intention &amp;nbsp; ⇒ &amp;nbsp; encoded &amp;nbsp; ⇒ &amp;nbsp; transmitted &amp;nbsp; ⇒ &amp;nbsp; decoded &amp;nbsp; ⇒ &amp;nbsp; intention/thought understood.

This is usually referred to as the code model&lt;ref&gt;Sperber, Dan/Wilson, Deirdre (1995): Relevance: Communication 
and Cognition, Second Edition, Oxford/Cambridge: Blackwell Publishers, pp. 2–9.&lt;/ref&gt; or the 
conduit metaphor&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, M. (1979): "The conduit metaphor – a case of frame conflict in our language about language." In: Ortony (ed., 1979), Metaphor and Thought, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
 pp. 284–324.&lt;/ref&gt; of communication.
Human communication however, is almost never this simple. Context almost always plays a part in communication 
as do other factors such as the author's intentions, the relationship between the sender and receiver and so forth.

The second way of conceiving how thoughts are communicated is by the author/speaker only conveying as much 
information as is needed in any given context, so that the audience can recover their intended meaning from 
what was said/written as well as from the context and implications. In this conceptual model, the author takes into account the context of the communication and the mutual cognitive environment between the author and the audience. (That is what the author/speaker thinks that audience already knows). They then say just enough to communicate what they intend – relying on the audience to fill in the details that they did not explicitly communicate. This can be visualized as follows:

 Speaker's thought/intention ± context-mediated information &amp;nbsp; ⇒ &amp;nbsp; encoded &amp;nbsp; ⇒ &amp;nbsp; transmitted &amp;nbsp; ⇒ &amp;nbsp; 
 decoded ± context-mediated information &amp;nbsp; ⇒ &amp;nbsp; thought/intention understood by hearer 
 (an interpretive resemblance to the speaker's intention).

== Overview ==
Sperber and Wilson's theory begins with some watershed assumptions that are typical of [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] 
theories. Namely, it argues that all [[utterance]]s are encountered in some context and that utterances convey a 
number of [[implicature]]s. In addition, they posit the notion of ''manifestness'', which is when something is grasped either consciously or unconsciously by a person.

They further note that it will be manifest to people who are engaged in inferential communication that each other have the notion of relevance in their minds. This will cause each person engaged in the interaction to arrive at the ''presumption of relevance'', which is the notion that ''(a) implicit messages are relevant enough to be worth bothering to process, and (b) the speaker will be as economical as they possibly can be in communicating it''.

The core of the theory is the "communicative principle of relevance", which states that by the act of making an 
utterance the speaker is conveying that what they have said is worth listening to, i.e. it will provide "cognitive 
effects" worthy of the processing effort required to find the meaning. In this way, every ostensive act 
of communication (that is the lexical "clues" that are explicitly conveyed when we speak/write) will look 
something like this:

# The speaker purposefully gives a clue to the hearer, ("ostensifies"), as to what she wishes to communicate – that is a clue to her intention.
# The hearer infers the intention from the clue and the context-mediated information. The hearer must interpret the clue, taking into account the context, and surmise what the speaker intended to communicate.

For Sperber and Wilson, relevance is conceived as relative or subjective, as it depends upon the state of knowledge of a hearer when they encounter an utterance. However, they are quick to note that their theory does not attempt to exhaustively define the concept of "relevance" in everyday use, but tries to show an interesting and important part of human communication, in particular ostensive-inferential communication.

== Formalization ==
Relevance theory's central insights are formalized in the following two-part principle, the Presumption of 
Optimal Relevance (see Postface to Sperber and Wilson 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;270):

* The ostensive stimulus is relevant enough for it to be worth the addressee's effort to process it.
* The ostensive stimulus is the most relevant one compatible with the communicator's abilities and preferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11383">{{Sexual orientation}}
'''Romantic orientation''', also called '''affectional orientation''', indicates the [[sex]] or [[gender]] with which a person is most likely to have a [[romance (love)|romantic relationship]] or [[Falling in love|fall in love]]. It is used both alternatively and side-by-side with the term ''[[sexual orientation]]'', and is based on the perspective that [[sexual attraction]] is but a single component of a larger dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Crethar, H. C. &amp; Vargas, L. A. (2007). ''Multicultural intricacies in professional counseling.'' In J. Gregoire &amp; C. Jungers (Eds.), The counselor’s companion: What every beginning counselor needs to know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. {{ISBN|0-8058-5684-6}}. p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although a [[pansexuality|pansexual]] person may feel sexually attracted to people regardless of gender, they may be predisposed to romantic intimacy with females. For [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Richards and Barker"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Christina|last1= Richards|first2= Meg|last2= Barker|title=Sexuality and Gender for Mental Health Professionals: A Practical Guide|isbn=1-4462-9313-0|publisher=[[Sage Publications|SAGE]]|year=2013|pages=124–127|accessdate=July 3, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uSiXAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cerankowski and Milks"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Karli June|last1=Cerankowski|first2= Megan|last2=Milks|title=Asexualities: Feminist and Queer Perspectives|isbn=1-134-69253-6|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|pages=89–93|accessdate=July 3, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLgTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic identities==
People may or may not engage in purely emotional [[Romance (love)|romantic]] relationships. The main identities relating to this are:&lt;ref name="Richards and Barker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cerankowski and Milks"/&gt;{{sfn|"Sex and Society"|p=82}}
* '''Aromantic''': Lack of romantic attraction towards anyone ([[#Aromanticism|aromanticism]]).
* '''Heteroromantic''' '''''(or heteromantic)''''': Romantic attraction towards person(s) of the opposite gender (heteroromanticism).
* '''Homoromantic''': Romantic attraction towards person(s) of the same gender (homoromanticism).
* '''Biromantic''': Romantic attraction towards person(s) of two or more, but not all genders. Sometimes used the same way as panromantic (biromanticism).
* '''Panromantic''': Romantic attraction towards person(s) of any, every, and all genders (panromanticism).
* '''Demiromantic''': Romantic attraction towards any of the above but only after forming a deep emotional bond with the person(s) (demiromanticism).

==Relationship with sexuality and asexuality==
The implications of the distinction between romantic and sexual orientations have not been fully recognized, nor have they been studied extensively.{{sfn|Bogaert|2012|p=14}} It is common for sources to describe sexual orientation as including components of both sexual and romantic (or romantic equivalent) attractions.{{sfn|Bogaert|2012|p=14}} Similarly, ''romantic love'' has been noted as "love with strong components of sexuality and infatuation",{{sfn|King|2010|p=450}} although some sources contradict this notion, stating that sexual and romantic attraction are not necessarily linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lgbtq.unc.edu/asexuality-attraction-and-romantic-orientation|title=Asexuality, Attraction, and Romantic Orientation|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to asexuality, while asexuals usually do not experience sexual attraction (see [[gray asexuality]]), they may still experience romantic attraction.&lt;ref name="Richards and Barker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cerankowski and Milks"/&gt;

==Aromanticism==
[[File:Aromantic Flag.svg|thumb|Aromantic flag]]
One of the attributes of aromantics is that despite feeling little or no romantic attraction, they can still enjoy sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a9644122/aromantic-definition-meaning/ |title=What is Aromantic - Asexual vs. Aromantic Definition, Explained |publisher=Cosmopolitan.com |date=2017-05-12 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aromantics are not necessarily incapable of feeling love. For example they may still feel familial love, or the type of platonic love that is expressed between friends.&lt;ref&gt;Parade, Beach Pride, and Beach Pride Parade. "PANTHER."&lt;/ref&gt; Some aromantics may claim that they are able to appreciate the type of love or romance that exists in popular culture, such as in movies, romantic books or songs, but only vicariously, and that they do not intuitively experience these feelings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/02/12/youtuber-connie-glynn-aka-noodlerella-reveals-aromantic-7306105/ |title=YouTuber Connie Glynn aka Noodlerella reveals she's aromantic &amp;#124; Metro News |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=2018-02-12 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Ryan.

Some publications have argued that there is an underrepresentation of asexuals and aromantics in media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/pop-culture-denies-aro-ace/ |title=How Pop Culture Denies Aromantic Asexual Existence |publisher=The Mary Sue |date=2016-02-19 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicola Pardy |url=https://www.refinery29.uk/2016/06/113484/what-is-asexual-definition-experiences |title=What Is Asexual - People Share Asexuality Experiences |publisher=Refinery29.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they are often misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yeow Kai Chaistlife@sph.com.sg |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/singer-songwriter-moses-sumney-does-not-mind-flying-the-freak-flag |title=Singer-songwriter Moses Sumney does not mind flying the freak flag, Entertainment News &amp; Top Stories |publisher=The Straits Times |date=2017-10-04 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aromantics sometimes face stigma and are stereotyped with labels such as being heartless, callous or deluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josh Salisbury |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/11/meet-the-aromantics-not-cold-dont-have-romantic-feelings-sex |title=Meet the aromantics: ‘I’m not cold – I just don’t have any romantic feelings’ &amp;#124; Life and style |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nivea Serrao |url=http://ew.com/books/2017/07/10/tash-hearts-tolstoy-interview/ |title=Tash Hearts Tolstoy author on depicting asexuality in YA fiction |publisher=EW.com |date=2017-07-10 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amatonormativity, a concept that elevates romantic relationships over non-romantic relationships, has been said to be damaging to aromantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wearyourvoicemag.com/more/culture/romance-not-universal-necessary |title=Romance is Not Universal, Nor is it Necessary |publisher=Wearyourvoicemag.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representation of aromantics in the media is{{when?|date=April 2018}} increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferguson |first=Sian |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2017/06/21/i-fell-in-love-with-my-friend-with-benefits/ |title=I fell in love with my friend with benefits |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2017-06-21 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aromantics are [[asexuality|asexual]],&lt;ref name="theguardian"/&gt; but the term ''aromantic'' can be used in relation to various [[sexual identities]], such as aromantic bisexual, aromantic heterosexual, aromantic lesbian, aromantic gay man or aromantic asexual.&lt;ref&gt;Youth, Gender Creative. "GLOSSARY OF TERMS: DEFINING A COMMON QUEER LANGUAGE." TEACHING, AFFIRMING, AND RECOGNIZING TRANS AND GENDER CREATIVE YOUTH: 299.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because aromanticism primarily deals with emotion rather than with sexuality or with the [[libido]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, Stacy Anne.

'''Secular Buddhism'''—sometimes also referred to as '''agnostic Buddhism''', '''Buddhist agnosticism''', '''ignostic Buddhism''', '''atheistic Buddhism''', '''pragmatic Buddhism''', '''Buddhist atheism''', or '''Buddhist secularism'''—is a broad term for an emerging form of [[Buddhism]] and [[secular spirituality]] that is based on [[humanism|humanist]], [[skeptical]], and/or [[agnostic]] values, as well as [[pragmatism]] and (often) [[Spiritual naturalism|naturalism]], rather than religious (or more specifically [[supernatural]] or [[paranormal]]) beliefs.

Secular Buddhists interpret the teachings of the [[Buddha]] and the [[Buddhist texts]] in a [[rationalist]] and often [[evidentialism|evidentialist]] manner, considering the historical and cultural contexts of the times in which the Buddha lived and the various [[List of suttas|sutta]]s, [[sutra]]s and [[tantra]]s were written.

Within the framework of secular Buddhism, Buddhist doctrine may be stripped of any unspecified combination of various traditional beliefs that could be considered [[superstitious]], or that cannot be tested through [[empirical research]], namely: supernatural beings (such as [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s, [[bodhisattvas]], [[nāga]]s, [[preta]]s, [[List of Buddhas|Buddha]]s, etc.), [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] and its [[Pariṇāmanā|transference]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], [[Buddhist cosmology]] (including the existence of [[pure land]]s and [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hells]]), etc.

Traditional Buddhist ethics, such as conservative views regarding [[Buddhism and abortion|abortion]], and [[Buddhism and sexuality|human sexuality]], may or may not be called into question as well. Some schools, especially [[Western Buddhism|Western Buddhist]] ones, take more progressive stances regarding social issues.

== History ==

The appearance of secular Buddhism is understood as part of the broad trend of secularization that has been developing in the West since the recovery of [[classical Greek culture]] in the Renaissance, rather than merely as a consequence of the supposed triumph of scientific rationalism over religion in the modern period. Moreover, many aspects of secular Buddhism have been prompted by organizational developments that began in a minority of lay Buddhist practice communities (''sanghas'') in the West during the last decades of the 20th century, when the hierarchical features of Buddhist monastic culture were abandoned in favor of democratic principles of civic association. In particular, the need to include women on an equal footing produced organizational innovations, which disrupted older patterns of patriarchal authority and gender exclusivity.&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt;

In the 21st century, the new information and communication technologies have provided a seedbed for secular Buddhism by making teachings and discussion more freely available and readily accessible, thus facilitating the formation of virtual and actual practice communities. Today there are websites explicitly dedicated to secular Buddhism in Australia, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, Spain, the UK and the USA.

Secular Buddhism has its roots in [[Buddhist modernism]] and [[secular humanism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The [[Vipassana movement|Insight meditation movement]] in the United States was founded on modernist secular values. [[Jack Kornfield]], an American teacher and former [[Theravada|Theravadin]] monk, stated that the [[Insight Meditation Society]] wanted to present Buddhist meditation “without the complications of rituals, robes, chanting and the whole religious tradition.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fronsdal|first1=Gil|title=Insight Meditation in the United States: Life , Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/InsightinUS.pdf|website=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SN Goenka|S. N. Goenka]], a popular teacher of Buddhist Vipassana meditation, taught that his practice was not a sectarian doctrine, but “something from which people of every background can benefit: an art of living.”&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Erik.  S. N. Goenka, Pioneer of Secular Meditation Movement, Dies at 90, http://tricycle.org/trikedaily/s-n-goenka-pioneer-secular-meditation-movement-dies-90/&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially treats Buddhism as an applied [[philosophy]], rather than a [[religion]],{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} or relies on [[Buddhist philosophy]] without dogmatism.

[[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]] is a self-proclaimed Secular Buddhist who promotes a strictly secular form of Buddhism. Batchelor was a Buddhist monk ordained in the more traditional forms of Buddhism. From his experience as a monk practicing [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and later [[Zen]], he felt the need for a more secular and agnostic approach. In his books ''Buddhism Without Beliefs'' and ''Confession of a Buddhist Atheist'' he articulates his approach to the Buddha's teaching, describes [[Buddha|Siddhattha]] Gautama as a historic person rather than an idealized religious icon, and scrutinizes typical Buddhist doctrines dealing with the concept of an [[afterlife]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] peer [[Eric Lubbock, 4th Baron Avebury|Lord Avebury]] was a secular Buddhist and a [[secular humanism|humanist]] and a patron of the [[British Humanist Association]] until his death. He was instrumental in securing the abolition of [[blasphemy]] as a crime in England and Wales.

== Key concepts and practices ==
Secular Buddhism is a newly emerging, predominantly lay movement within Buddhism. Unlike the various kinds of Buddhist modernism, which tend to be modifications of traditional schools of Buddhist thought and practice in the light of the discourses of modernity, secular Buddhism is founded on a reconfiguration of core elements of the dharma itself.&lt;ref name="Batchelor" /&gt; To this end it seeks to recover the original teachings of Siddhattha Gotama, the historical Buddha, yet without claiming to disclose "what the Buddha really meant". Rather, it interprets the early canonical teachings in a way that draws out their meaning in the Buddha's own historical context (the culture of the Gangetic plains in the fifth century BCE) while demonstrating their value and relevance to people living in our own time. Both aspects of this interpretation are literally "secular" in that they evoke the Latin root word ''saeculum'' – a particular age or generation. The ethos of the movement is perhaps best captured in Stephen Batchelor's ''Confession of a Buddhist Atheist''.&lt;ref name="Batchelor2" /&gt;

Secular Buddhism proposes that we leave behind the metaphysical beliefs and [[soteriology]] of Indian religious culture. This culture saw human life as an irredeemable realm of suffering, from which one should seek transcendence in an enduring beyond-human condition – a stance that virtually all Buddhist schools, as well as Hinduism and Jainism, perpetuate. Secular Buddhism, on the other hand, seeks to deploy the Buddha's teaching as a guide to full human flourishing in this life and this world. In adopting this post-metaphysical{{clarify|date=January 2018}} position, it parts company with existing religious forms of Buddhist orthodoxy, which have evolved since the Buddha's death. Instead, it aligns itself with today's post-metaphysical philosophy, not least phenomenology, so finding itself on a convergent path with similar movements in radical Christian theology, as exemplified by the work of thinkers such as [[Don Cupitt]] and [[Gianni Vattimo]].&lt;ref name="Cupitt" /&gt;

Secular Buddhism likewise rejects the authoritarian structures of power legitimated by the metaphysics of orthodox Buddhist belief. It questions notions of spiritual progress based on standardized prescriptions for meditation practice, as well as the widespread idea that Buddhist practice is essentially concerned with gaining proficiency in a set of meditative techniques endorsed by the authority of a traditional school or teacher.&lt;ref name="Magid" /&gt;  Instead, secular Buddhism emphasizes a praxis that encourages autonomy and encompasses equally every aspect of one's humanity, as modeled by the [[Noble Eightfold Path|noble eight-fold path]] (right vision, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness and concentration). Such an approach is open to generating a wide range of responses to specific individual and communal needs, rather than insisting on there being "one true way" to "enlightenment" valid for all times and places.

==Biography==
Born in New York City, Morgenbesser undertook philosophical study at the [[City College of New York]] and rabbinical study at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], then pursued graduate study in philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he wrote his Ph.D. thesis under the direction of [[Nelson Goodman]].  Morgenbesser began teaching at [[Swarthmore College]], took a position at Columbia in 1953 and, in 1975, was named the [[John Dewey]] Professor of Philosophy there, a position he held until his retirement in 1993. Morgenbesser was known particularly for [[q:Sidney Morgenbesser|his sharp witticisms and humor]], which often penetrated to the heart of the philosophical issue at hand and earned him the nickname from ''The New York Times'' as "the Sidewalk Socrates."&lt;ref name="sidewalk"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/magazine/26MORGENBESSER.html | title=Sidewalk Socrates | work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] | date=26 December 2004 | accessdate=7 July 2015 | author=Ryerson, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published little, and established no school, but was revered for his extraordinary intelligence and moral seriousness. He was a famously influential teacher; his former students include [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Raymond Geuss]], [[Alvin Goldman]], [[Daniel Hausman]], [[Robert Nozick]], [[Derek Parfit]], and [[Gideon Rosen]]. In 1967, Morgenbesser signed a letter declaring his intention to [[w:tax resistance|refuse to pay taxes]] in protest against the U.S. [[war in Vietnam]], and urging other people to also take this stand.&lt;ref name="collection1.libraries.psu.edu"&gt;"An Open Letter" [http://collection1.libraries.psu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/transaction/id/17162 archived at Horowitz Transaction Publishers Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Morgenbesser's areas of expertise included the [[philosophy of social science]], [[political philosophy]], [[epistemology]], and the history of [[American Pragmatism]].  He founded the Society for Philosophy and Public Affairs along with [[G.A. Cohen]], [[Thomas Nagel]] and others.&lt;ref name="HeldMorgenbesser1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Virginia Held|author2=Sidney Morgenbesser|author3=Thomas Nagel |title=Philosophy, morality, and international affairs: essays edited for the Society for Philosophy and Public Affairs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0fPbAAAAMAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] in 1963.

He died in New York City.

== Stories and quotations ==
{{prose|date=April 2013}}
* During a lecture the Oxford linguistic philosopher [[J. L. Austin]] made the claim that although a [[double negative]] in English implies a positive meaning, there is no language in which a [[Pleonasm|double positive]] implies a negative. To which Morgenbesser responded in a dismissive tone, "Yeah, yeah."&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt; (Some have quoted it as "Yeah, right.")
* Morgenbesser was leaving a subway station in New York City and put his pipe in his mouth as he was ascending the steps. A police officer told him that there was no smoking on the subway. Morgenbesser pointed out that he was leaving the subway, not entering it, and hadn't lit up yet anyway. The cop again said that smoking was not allowed in the subway, and Morgenbesser repeated his comment. The cop said, "If I let you do it, I'd have to let everyone do it." Morgenbesser replied, "Who do you think you are, [[Kant]]?" The word "Kant" was mistaken for a vulgar epithet and Morgenbesser had to [[Categorical imperative|explain the situation]] at the police station.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;
* On the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]]: Morgenbesser, ordering dessert, is told by the waitress that he can choose between apple pie and blueberry pie. He orders the apple pie. Shortly thereafter, the waitress comes back and says that cherry pie is also an option; Morgenbesser says "In that case I'll have the blueberry pie."&lt;ref&gt;Gaming the vote: why elections aren't fair (and what we can do about it), William Poundstone, p. 50, {{ISBN|0-8090-4893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Morgenbesser said the following of [[George Santayana]]: "There's a guy who asserted both ''p'' and not-''p'', and then drew out '''all''' the consequences…" &lt;ref name="language_log"&gt;"Language Log" blog, [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001314.html Language Log, If P, so why not Q], 5 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interrogated by a student whether he agreed with [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]]'s view that a statement can be both true and false at the same time, Morgenbesser replied "Well, I do and I don't."&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;
* During campus protests of the 1960s, Sidney Morgenbesser was hit on the head by police. When asked whether he had been treated unfairly or unjustly, he responded that it was "unfair, but not unjust.  It was unfair because they hit me over the head, but not unjust because they hit everyone else over the head."&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Some of his students then argued that it may have been unjust, because he had not been proven guilty, but it was not unfair because the others were treated in the same way.&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt; This alternative version is sometimes attributed to Morgenbesser himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fletcher |first1=George P. |title=The Grammar of Criminal Law: American, Comparative, and International Volume One: Foundations (Oxford: Oxford U.

* In 1967, Morgenbesser signed a letter declaring his intention to [[tax resistance|refuse to pay taxes]] in protest against the U.S. war in Vietnam, and urging other people to also take this stand.&lt;ref name="collection1.libraries.psu.edu"/&gt;
* Morgenbesser described [[Gentile]] [[ethics]] as entailing "ought implies can" while in [[Jew]]ish ethics "can implies don't."&lt;ref name="timesonline"/&gt;
* When challenged why he had written so little, he fired back: "[[Moses]] wrote one book. Then what did he do?"&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;
* When asked his opinion of pragmatism, Morgenbesser replied "It's all very well in theory but it doesn't work in practice."&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;
* In response to Heidegger's ontological query "Why is there something rather than nothing?" Morgenbesser answered "If there were nothing you'd still be complaining!"&lt;ref&gt;''There are two errors in the {{not a typo|the}} title of this book: A sourcebook of philosophical puzzles, paradoxes and problems'', Robert M.

He served as [[United States Commissioner of Education]] in the administration of President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/SMMPP.aspx "Inventory of Sterling McMurrin Papers at John F. Kennedy Presidential Library"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:AR7025-A. President John F. Kennedy Meets with Education Officials.jpg|thumb|McMurrin (left) with Executive Secretary of the National Education Association [[William George Carr|William G. Carr]] (center) and President Kennedy, 1962]]
Born in [[Woods Cross, Utah]], McMurrin's family moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in the 1920s while he was at a young age.  There he attended high school and the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA), but he gained his A.B. in history and M.A. in philosophy from the [[University of Utah]].  Returning to California for doctoral studies, the [[University of Southern California]] awarded him a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1946.  McMurrin also did postdoctoral studies at [[Columbia University]], [[Princeton University]], and [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]].  For a time McMurrin worked for the LDS [[Church Educational System]], first as a seminary teacher in 1937, then a teacher at [[Arizona State University]], and [[Institute of Religion]] director at the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref name=ostler&gt;Original publication: {{Cite news |first= Blake |last= Ostler |authorlink= Blake Ostler |date= 11 January 1983 |title= |newspaper= [[List of Latter Day Saint periodicals#Independent|Seventh East Press]] |place= Provo, Utah |pp= 5–11 }} &lt;br/&gt;Reprint, with additions: {{harvnb|McMurrin|Ostler|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his religion, McMurrin argued that the LDS Church concealed parts of its history and had been declining in intellectual freedom.  He believed that an honest study of religion would erode faith, and he personally did not believe in the [[historicity of the Book of Mormon]].  However, he remained devoted to Mormonism, despite his lack of faith and criticism from more "orthodox" church members.&lt;ref name=ostler/&gt; In the early 1950s, Joseph Fielding Smith and Harold B. Lee believed McMurrin should be excommunicated. David O. McKay met with McMurrin and agreed to testify on McMurrin's behalf, but the apostles did not pursue the excommunication. Joseph Fielding Smith suggested again that McMurrin be excommunicated in 1965, but McKay declined to take action.&lt;ref name=Prince&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prince|first1=Gregory A.|title=David O. McKay and the rise of modern Mormonism|date=2005|publisher=University of Utah Press|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|isbn=0-87480-822-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp||55—58}}

In McMurrin's noted career, he worked with universities, large corporations, foundations, and governmental agencies, as a teacher, an administrator, and an advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.hum.utah.edu/humcntr/PDF/Sterlingbio.pdf |title= Who Was Sterling M.

'''''The Death of Ivan Ilyich''''' ({{lang-ru|Смерть Ивана Ильича}}, ''Smert' Ivána Ilyichá''), first published in 1886, is a [[novella]] by [[Leo Tolstoy]], considered one of the masterpieces of his late fiction, written shortly after his [[religious conversion]] of the late 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilʹich: A Critical Companion|last = Jahn|first = Gary R.|publisher = Northwestern University Press|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Usually classed among the best examples of the novella",&lt;ref&gt;"Tolstoy, Leo." Encyclopædia Britannica. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite''.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'' tells the story of a high-court judge in 19th-century Russia and his sufferings and death from a terminal illness.

==Plot==

===Characters===
*Ivan Ilyich (''Ilyich'' is a [[patronymic]], his [[surname]] is ''Golovin'') is a highly regarded official of the [[Judiciary of Russia|Court of Justice]], described by Tolstoy as, "neither as cold and formal as his elder brother nor as wild as the younger, but was a happy mean between them—an intelligent, polished, lively, and agreeable man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tolstoy|first=Leo|title=The Death of Ivan Ilyich|year=1886|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's (2011)|location=The Story and Its Writer. Ed. Ann Charters|pages=794–833}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story progresses, he becomes more and more introspective and emotional as he ponders the reason for his agonizing illness and death.
*Praskovya Fëdorovna Golovin is Ivan's unsympathetic wife. She is characterized as self-absorbed and uninterested in her husband's struggles, unless they directly affect her.
*Gerasim is the Golovins' young butler. He takes on the role of sole comforter and caretaker during Ivan's illness.
*Peter Ivanovich is Ivan's longtime friend and colleague. He studied law with Ivan and is the first to recognize Ivan's impending death.
*Lisa Golovin is Ivan's daughter.
*Fëdor Petrishchev is Lisa's fiancé.

===Plot summary===
Ivan Ilyich lives a carefree life that is "most simple and most ordinary and therefore most terrible". Like everyone he knows, he spends his life climbing the social ladder. Enduring marriage to a woman whom he often finds too demanding, he works his way up to be a magistrate, thanks to the influence he has over a friend who has just been promoted, focusing more on his work as his family life becomes less tolerable.

While hanging curtains for his new home one day, he falls awkwardly and hurts his side. Though he does not think much of it at first, he begins to suffer from a pain in his side. As his discomfort grows, his behavior towards his family becomes more irritable. His wife finally insists that he visit a physician. The physician cannot pinpoint the source of his malady, but soon it becomes clear that his condition is terminal. Confronted with his diagnosis, Ivan attempts every remedy he can to obtain a cure for his worsening situation, until the pain grows so intense that he is forced to cease working and spend the remainder of his days in bed. Here, he is brought face to face with his mortality and realizes that, although he knows of it, he does not truly grasp it.

During the long and painful process of dying, Ivan dwells on the idea that he does not deserve his suffering because he has lived rightly. If he had not lived a good life, there could be a reason for his pain; but he has, so pain and death must be arbitrary and senseless. As he begins to hate his family for avoiding the subject of his death, for pretending he is only sick and not dying, he finds his only comfort in his peasant boy servant, Gerasim, the only person in Ivan's life who does not fear death, and also the only one who, apart from his own son, shows compassion for him. Ivan begins to question whether he has, in fact, lived a good life.

In the final days of his life, Ivan makes a clear split between an artificial life, such as his own, which masks the true meaning of life and makes one fear death, and an authentic life, the life of Gerasim. Authentic life is marked by compassion and sympathy, the artificial life by self-interest. Then "some force" strikes Ivan in the chest and side, and he is brought into the presence of a bright light. His hand falls onto his nearby son's head, and Ivan pities his son. He no longer hates his daughter or wife, but rather feels pity for them, and hopes his death will release them. In so doing, his terror of death leaves him, and as Tolstoy suggests, death itself disappears.

==Interpretation==
In 1984, philosopher Merold Westphal said that the story depicts "death as an enemy which (1) leads us to deceive ourselves, (2) robs us of the meaning of life, and (3) puts us in solitary confinement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Westphal|first1=Merold|title=God, Guilt, and Death: An Existential Phenomenology of Religion.&lt;/i&gt; (1984) : , 1987.|date=1984|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=0253204178|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, psychologist Mark Freeman wrote:

{{quote|Tolstoy's book is about many things: the tyranny of bourgeois niceties, the terrible weak spots of the human heart, the primacy and elision of death. But more than anything, I would offer, it is about the consequences of living without meaning, that is, without a true and abiding connection to one's ''life'' ... (384)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Mark|title=Death, Narrative Integrity, and the Radical Challenge of Self-Understanding: A Reading of Tolstoy's 'Death of Ivan Ilyich'|journal=Ageing &amp; Society|date=July 1997|volume=17|issue=04|pages=373–398}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, the mundane portrayal of Ivan's life coupled with the dramatization of his long and grueling battle with death seems to directly reflect Tolstoy's theories about [[Ethics|moral living]], which he largely derived during his sabbatical from personal and professional duties in 1877. In his lectures on [[Russian literature]], Russian-born novelist and critic [[Vladimir Nabokov]] argues that, for Tolstoy, a sinful life (such as Ivan's) is moral death. Therefore, death, the return of the soul to God, is, for Tolstoy, moral life. To quote Nabokov: "The [[Tolstoyan]] formula is: Ivan lived a bad life and since the bad life is nothing but the death of the soul, then Ivan lived a living death; and since beyond death is God's living light, then Ivan died into a new life – Life with a capital L."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lectures On Russian Literature|last = Nabokov|first = Vladimir Vladimirovich|publisher = Harcourt|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = 237|author-link = Vladimir Nabokov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Death]] permeates the narrative in a realistic and absorbing fashion, but the actual physicality of death is only present in the early chapters during Ivan's wake. Instead, the story leads the reader through a pensive, metaphysical exploration of the reason for death and what it means to truly live. Tolstoy was a man who struggled greatly with self-doubt and spiritual reflection, especially as he grew close to his own death in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.online-literature.com/tolstoy/|title = Biography of Leo Tolstoy|date = 2007|access-date = February 23, 2016|website = The Literature Network|publisher = Jalic Inc.|last = Merriman|first = C. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''A Confession'', Tolstoy writes:

{{quote|No matter how often I may be told, "You cannot understand the meaning of life so do not think about it, but live," I can no longer do it: I have already done it too long. I cannot now help seeing day and night going round and bringing me to death. That is all I see, for that alone is true. All else is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tolstoy|first1=Leo|title=A Confession|date=1882|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=0-486-43851-1|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This personal [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] caused significant spiritual upheaval in Tolstoy's life, prompting him to question the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Education in Russia|education]], [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]], etc.&lt;ref name="The Big Read2006–2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Death of Ivan Ilyich: About the Author|publisher=The Big Read(2006–2011)|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature Tolstoy composed during this period is some of his most controversial and philosophical, among which falls ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'' and other famous short stories such as ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]'' and ''[[The Devil (novel)|The Devil]]''. From a biographical standpoint, therefore, it is possible to interpret ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'' as a manifestation of Tolstoy's embroilment with death and the meaning of his own life during his final years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/book-reviews-tuesday-tome-the-death-of-ivan-ilyich-leo-tolstoy/|title = Proximity to Death: Authentic Living and Authentic Dying in Leo Tolstoy’s The Death of Ivan Ilyich|date = October 20, 2015|access-date = February 23, 2016|website = The Gemsbok|publisher = |last = Podgorski|first = Daniel|series = Your Tuesday Tome}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, by dramatizing a particular sort of lifestyle and its unbearable decline, Tolstoy is able to impart his philosophy that success, such as Ivan Ilyich's, comes at a great moral cost and if one decides to pay this cost, life will become hollow and insincere and therefore worse than death.&lt;ref name="The Big Read2006–2011"/&gt;

[[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''magnum opus'', ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927), refers to the novella as an illustration of Being towards death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Walter|title=Existentialism and Death|journal=Chicago Review|date=Summer 1959|volume=13|issue=02|pages=75–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Occult World''''' is a book originally published in 1881 in London; it was compiled by a member of the [[Theosophical Society]] [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]].{{sfn|Formats and editions}} It was the first [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] work by the author; according to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]], this book "gave sensational publicity to [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] [[Paranormal|phenomena]]" and the [[Mahatma Letters|letters]] from the [[mahatma]]s, and drew the attention of the London [[Society for Psychical Research]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Kuhn]] wrote that this book by Sinnett "was the first direct statement to the West of the existence of the [[mahatma|Masters]] and their activity as sponsors for the Theosophical Society." In his opinion, the author convincingly took over the major objective of confirming the "surpassing knowledge and sublime wisdom" of these "supermen."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=151}}}}

== History of compilation and publication ==
In September and October 1880 [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] visited Sinnett at [[Simla]].{{refn|group=note|P. Washington wrote that Blavatsky had been in sincere friendship with Sinnett and his wife Patience.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 3}}}} Sinnett expressed serious interest in the work and teachings of the Theosophical Society, and it prompted Blavatsky help him into contact and correspondence with two [[adept]]s who sponsored the Society, the mahatmas [[Kuthumi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]].{{sfn|Theowiki}}{{refn|group=note|Goodrick-Clarke wrote that "the very concept of the Masters" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel Olcott claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}} He was able to gather the material for his first theosophical book, which was based mostly on his notes of Blavatsky's [[occult]] work, and which "made her name widely known, though it contained nothing from her pen."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}

In the second half of 1880, Anglo-Indian newspaper [[The Pioneer (newspaper)|''The Pioneer'']] published several individual and collective reports of witnesses of Blavatsky's occult phenomena, in particular on 7 November 1880 a report which was written by Sinnett himself.{{sfn|Hanson|1980|loc=Ch. V}} In 1881, he incorporated these reports into his book. In February 1881 Kuthumi, writing that he is interested in Sinnett's book and its success, gave permission to use his letters: "I lay no restrictions upon your making use of anything I may have written to you..., having full confidence in your tact and judgment as to what should be printed and how it should be presented."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 8}} In March 1881 the Sinnetts went on vacation to England, expecting to find a publisher for ''The Occult World.''{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=18}}{{refn|group=note|1 March 1881 Kuthumi wished Sinnett to return from Europe "with a good book" in his hand.{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 107}}}} The book was published in June 1881 during the author's stay in London. In July 1881 Sinnett returned to India, and on the next day after the arrival he received a letter in which Kuthumi congratulated him on the publication.{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=19}} Kuthumi wrote: "When the first hum and ding-dong of adverse criticism is hushed, thoughtful men will read and ponder over the book."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 9}}

The book is dedicated by author "to '''the Mahatma [[Koot Hoomi]]''' whose gracious friendship has given the present writer his title to claim the attention of the European world."{{sfn|Sinnett|1895}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=90}}

=== Occult philosophy ===
The book begins with the author's allegation that there is a school of thought which modern culture has forgotten, and that the metaphysics, and to a large degree the present physical science, "have been groping for centuries blindly after knowledge which occult philosophy has enjoyed in full measure all the while." Sinnett takes the liberty to express his belief that his knowledge is certainly true.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=152}} He argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I have come into some contact with persons who are heirs of a greater knowledge concerning the mysteries of Nature and humanity than modern culture has yet evolved... Modern science has accomplished grand results by the open method of investigation, and is very impatient of the theory that persons who ever attained to real knowledge, either in sciences or metaphysics, could have been content to hide their light under a bushel... But there is no need to construct hypotheses in the matter. The facts are accessible if they are sought for in the right way."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=2–4|Kuhn|1992|2p=152}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sinnett explains that "the ultimate development" of an occultist requires him to comply with "absolute physical purity." The candidate is obliged from the beginning to provide evidence that he is willing to comply with this requirement. Throughout the trial period, he should observe complete celibacy, and to refrain from all physical pleasures. However, this way of life does not presuppose any particular rigid discipline or hard asceticism, or "withdrawal from the world."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=153}} The author says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There would be nothing to prevent a gentleman in ordinary society from being in some of the preliminary stages of training for occult candidature without anybody about him being the wiser. For true occultism, the sublime achievement of the real adept, is not attained through the loathsome asceticism of the ordinary Indian fakir, the ''[[yogi]]'' of the woods and wilds, whose dirt accumulates with his sanctity—of the fanatic who fastens iron hooks into his flesh, or holds up an arm until it is withered."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=26–27|Kuhn|1992|2pp=153–154}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult correspondence ===
On 29 September 1880 during an evening walk with Mrs. Sinnett, Blavatsky, responding to the suddenly expressed desire of her companion to get a little note from one of the [[Mahatma|"Brothers"]], tore off a corner of a letter received that day, and held it in her hand until it disappeared. Then Blavatsky asked her to specify where there should be a note. Mrs. Sinnett pointed to a tree, and then among its branches, she found the same corner of the paper, but now it contained a brief message written in English and signed in Tibetan symbols.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=61–63|Kuhn|1992|2p=80}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. IV}}{{sfn|Olcott|2011|pp=231–232}}&lt;br/&gt;According to Barborka, this note was the first message of the mahatmas, which had come in response to an oral request, and after it Sinnett decided to write his first letter to the "Unknown Brother."{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. IV}}{{refn|group=note|This note is stored in the department of rare manuscripts of the [[British Library]]. Barborka wrote: "The folds of the paper and holes made when the note was pinned onto the twig are clearly visible."{{sfn|Barborka|1973|p=18}}}} The author says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One day, therefore, I asked Madame Blavatsky whether if I wrote a letter to one of the Brothers explaining my views, she could get it delivered for me. I hardly thought this was probable, as I knew how very unapproachable the Brothers generally are; but as she said that at any rate she would try, I wrote a letter, addressing it 'to the Unknown Brother', and gave it to her to see if any result would ensue. It was a happy inspiration that induced me to do this, for out of that small beginning has arisen the most interesting correspondence in which I have ever been privileged to engage."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=92–93|Barborka|1973|2p=59}}{{refn|group=note|[[Olav Hammer|Hammer]] noted that between 1880 and 1884 Sinnett received from the mahatmas circa one hundred twenty letters.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=381}} Kuhn wrote: "Sinnett was the channel of transmission, and to him the two Masters sent a long series of letters on philosophical and other subjects, they themselves remaining in the background."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=154}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult phenomena ===
During Blavatsky's first visit to the Sinnetts' house at [[Allahabad]], they were able to observe, in addition to the raps, one more phenomenon. For a few days they had gone with their guest to Benares, where they had settled at a house which had been lent by the maharaja of Vizianagaram. One evening after dinner, they sat in the great hall of the house. "Suddenly three or four flowers – cut roses – fell" right between them.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1p=51|Kuhn|1992|2p=80}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{refn|group=note|[[René Guénon|Guénon]] wrote that the many theosophical phenomena can be found in a book by Sinnett ''The Occult World,'' which mentions the following things: "knocking at will, tingling of invisible bells, the carrying and 'materialization' of all sorts of objects, and above all, 'precipitation' of letters sent by 'astral' means."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}}}}

At Simla a picnic was planned, and a group of six men had intended to go into the forest. The supplies were designed for six men, but a seventh person suddenly joined the group. In preparation for the midday meal, the lack of a coffee cup and saucer was revealed. Someone jestingly suggested to Blavatsky to materialize the additional cup. Blavatsky held a "mental conversation" with one of her outlying "Brothers" and then pointed to a specific place, overgrown with grass and bushes. One of the participants began to dig there with a knife. After some time a white object was found, which was a tea-cup, and near it was a saucer, and as such they were no different from the other six cups and saucers brought from the Sinnetts' house. Plant roots around the utensils were found intact, and it has reportedly been proved that no one pre-dug there. When Mrs. Sinnett reached the house she counted the cups and saucers of this design and found one extra cup and saucer. However, it was impossible to buy such utensils at Simla.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=66–68|Kuhn|1992|2pp=80–81}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|p=158}}{{refn|group=note|Olcott stated about the phenomenon with a tea-cup: "To complete this part of my narrative, I will state that Mrs. Sinnett and I, reaching the house first, on the return of our party, went straight to the butler's pantry, and found the three other cups of the nine which she had left of the original dozen, put away on an upper shelf with their handles broken, and otherwise dilapidated. The seventh cup produced at the picnic had, therefore, not formed pan {{sic}} of her broken set."{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=234}}}}{{refn|group=note|It should be noted that Sinnett's reports on Blavatsky's phenomena at Simla "were the cause of much of the misunderstanding and suffering she had to endure for the rest of her life."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}} Nonetheless, [[Manly Palmer Hall|Hall]] stated: "Madam Blavatsky's greatest 'miracles' are her books, and by her writings she is elevated far beyond the reach of her calumniators. Her literary accomplishments and not materialized tea-cups are the hallmark of her genius."{{sfn|Hall|1931|p=92}}}}&lt;br/&gt; This outing had one more event, when it turned out that they could not make coffee because all the water bottles were empty, and the water in the nearest stream was dirty. Their servants, sent to the brewery, were unable to get water. Then Blavatsky put the empty bottle into one of the baskets, and then pulled it out, already filled with clean water.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=73–74|Kuhn|1992|2p=82}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{refn|group=note|The major disciple of Kuthumi known as the [[Djwal Khul|"Disinherited"]] made a postscript to the letter of his Master: "The bottle filled with water I filled with my own hand—was one of the four only that the servants had in the baskets."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 8}}}}

During another outing occurred the "incident with pillow." Blavatsky turned to Sinnett with the question of where he would like to find a thing that Kuthumi is going to send. Sinnett decided to choose the most inconvenient place and pointed to one of several cushions, but at the insistence of his wife, he chose another. Once the firmly sewn pillow was ripped, they found among the feathers a note from Kuthumi and the brooch, which Mrs. Sinnett left at home.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=109–111|Kuhn|1992|2p=83}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. X}}{{refn|group=note|"The skilled occultist is able to shift his consciousness from one to another plane of manifestation. In short, his control over the vibrational energies of the [[Akasha]] makes him veritably lord of all the physical creation."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=153}}}}

"While the letters [from the mahatmas] are the most valuable portion of the book," the most likely cause of its widespread popularity was the occult phenomena described by the author, which he observed personally.{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}{{refn|group=note|Lavoie wrote that ''The Occult World'' contains a description of the various phenomena, which were performed by Blavatsky in the presence of the author.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=33}} [[K. Paul Johnson|Johnson]] noted that while staying in the author's home, Blavatsky "performed an astounding series of paranormal phenomena" which were reported in ''The Occult World.''{{sfn|Johnson|1995|p=21}}}}

== Criticism ==
[[René Guénon|Guénon]] wrote that Sinnett, who "at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophism]] known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme Blavatsky's tricks."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}} In the [[Hodgson Report]] Blavatsky's phenomena described in the book by Sinnett are discussed in a section "''The Occult World'' Phenomena".{{sfn|Hodgson|1885|pp=256–273}} At the end of this section, [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Hodgson]] claimed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think I am justified in saying that the phenomena relied upon by Mr. Sinnett in ''The Occult World'' can be accounted for much more satisfactorily than can the performances of any ordinary professional conjurer by the uninitiated observer, however acute; that the additional details which I have been enabled to furnish in connection with some of the incidents Mr. Sinnett has recorded, clearly show that he has not been in the habit of exercising due caution for the exclusion of trickery; and that he has not proceeded in accordance with those 'scientific modes of investigation' which he explicitly declares (''Occult World,'' p. 35) he regarded as necessary for the task he attempted."{{sfn|Hodgson|1885|p=273}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Vsevolod Solovyov|Solovyov]] (with irony in relation to Sinnett) stated that from the analysis of the phenomena described in ''The Occult World'' in the Hodgson Report, "we can draw a conclusion: what a 'serious and honest' ''researcher'' we are dealing with in the case of Mr. Sinnett, this 'famous apostle' of the modern Theosophy and main defender of H. P. Blavatsky."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1893|p=158}} Nevertheless, according to Goodrick-Clarke, "a thorough analysis of the Hodgson Report by [[Vernon Harrison]] of the SPR effectively demolished... the conclusions of the Report."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=14}}{{See also|Incidents in the Life of Madame Blavatsky#Criticism}}

An American [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] [[Henry Kiddle]] addressed in 1883 in a London spiritualist magazine ''[[Light (spiritualist journal)|Light]]'' letter to the editor,{{sfn|Neff|2003|loc=Ch. X}} in which he said that after reading Sinnett's book ''The Occult World,'' he was "very greatly surprised,"{{sfn|Kiddle|1883}} when he discovered that one of Kuthumi's letters published in the book contains text which "was for the most part quite simply the copy of a lecture," which he made at Lake Pleasant 15 August 1880,{{sfnm|Guénon|2004|1p=40|Lavoie|2012|2p=253}} and published the same month in ''[[Banner of Light]].'' In this connection, Kiddle asked: "As Mr. Sinnett's book did not appear till a considerable time afterwards (about a year, I think), it is certain that I did not quote, consciously or unconsciously, from its pages. How, then, did it get into Kuthumi's mysterious letter?"{{sfn|Kiddle|1883}}&lt;br/&gt;
According to Guénon, "the Professor Kiddle incident" was the first strike to hit the Theosophical Society overtly. He wrote that Sinnett has presented in the fourth edition of ''The Occult World'' "a rather awkward explanation," which came from Kuthumi himself.{{refn|group=note|In December 1883 Sinnett received from the mahatma a clarification on the matter,{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 93}} and it was published in an appendix to the fourth edition of ''The Occult World''.}} Kuthumi stated that what looked like plagiarism was due to the awkwardness and carelessness of a pupil. The "Master" was forced to admit that he was negligent when he allowed his letter to be sent without checking and correction.{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=51}} He has written so:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The letter in question was framed by me while on a journey and on horseback. It was dictated mentally in the direction of and precipitated by a young ''chela'' not yet expert at this branch of psychic chemistry, and who had to transcribe it from the hardly visible imprint. Half of it, therefore, was omitted, and the other half more or less distorted by the 'artist'. When asked by him at the time whether I would look over and correct it, I answered—imprudently, I confess—'Anyhow will do, my boy; it is of no great importance if you skip a few words.' I was physically very tired by a ride of forty-eight hours consecutively, and (physically again) half asleep. Besides this, I had very important business to attend to psychically, and therefore little remained of me to devote to that letter. When I awoke I found it had already been sent on, and as I was not then anticipating its publication, I never gave it from that time a thought... Yet had I dictated my letter in the form it now appears in print, it would certainly look suspicious, and however far from what is generally called plagiarism, yet in the absence of any inverted commas it would lay a foundation for censure. But I did nothing of the kind, as the original impression now before me clearly shows."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=212–213|Lavoie|2012|2p=254}}{{refn|group=note|"When a Mr. Henry Kiddle, an American lecturer on Spiritualism, accused the writer of the Mahatma Letters of having plagiarized whole passages from his lecture delivered at Mt. Pleasant, New York, in 1880, a year prior to the publication of ''The Occult World'', the Master [[Kuthumi|K.H.]] explained in a letter to Mr. Sinnett that the apparent forgery of words and ideas came about through a bit of carelessness on his part in the precipitation of his ideas through a chela. While dictating the letter to the latter, he had caught himself 'listening in' on Mr. Kiddle's address being delivered at the moment in America; and as a consequence the chela took down portions of the actual lecture as reflected from the mind of K.H."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=157}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After its first publication in 1881 the book was reprinted several times: in 1882 came the 2nd edition, in 1883 – 3rd, 1913 – 9th.

In the [[philosophy of science]], '''underdetermination''' refers to situations where the evidence available is insufficient to identify which belief one should hold about that evidence.  For example, if all that was known was that exactly $10 was spent on apples and oranges, and that apples cost $1 and oranges $2, then one would know enough to eliminate some possibilities (e.g., 6 oranges could not have been purchased), but one would not have enough evidence to know which specific combination of apples and oranges was purchased.  In this example, one would say that belief in what combination was purchased is underdetermined by the available evidence.

==History ==
Ancient Greek [[Skepticism|skeptics]] argued for ''equipollence'', the view that reasons for and against claims are equally balanced. This captures at least one sense of saying that the claims themselves are underdetermined.

Underdetermination, again under different labels, arises in the modern period in the work of [[René Descartes]]. Among other skeptical arguments, Descartes presents two arguments involving underdetermination. His [[dream argument]] points out that experiences perceived while dreaming (for example, falling) do not necessarily contain sufficient information to deduce the true situation (being in bed). He concluded that since one cannot always distinguish dreams from reality, one cannot rule out the possibility that one is dreaming rather than having [[veridical dream|veridical]] experiences; thus the conclusion that one is having a veridical experience is underdetermined. His [[Evil demon|demon argument]] posits that all of one's experiences and thoughts might be manipulated by a very powerful and deceptive "evil demon". Once again, so long as the perceived reality appears internally consistent to the limits of one's limited ability to tell, the situation is indistinguishable from reality and one cannot logically determine that such a demon does not exist.

==Underdetermination and evidence==
To show that a conclusion is underdetermined, one must show that there is a rival conclusion that is equally well supported by the standards of evidence.  A trivial example of underdetermination is the addition of the statement "whenever we look for evidence" (or more generally, any statement which cannot be [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). For example, the conclusion "objects near earth fall toward it when dropped" might be opposed by "objects near earth fall toward it when dropped but only when one checks to see that they do." Since one may append this to any conclusion, all conclusions are at least trivially underdetermined.  If one considers such statements to be illegitimate, e.g. by applying [[Occam's Razor]], then such "tricks" are not considered demonstrations of underdetermination.

This concept also applies to [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]]: for example, it is similarly trivial to find situations that a theory does not address. For example, [[classical mechanics]] did not distinguish between non-accelerating [[Frame of reference|reference frames]]. As a result, any conclusion about such a reference frame was underdetermined; it was equally consistent with the theory to say that the solar system is at rest, as it is to say that it moves at any constant velocity in any particular direction. Newton himself stated that these possibilities were indistinguishable. More generally, evidence may not always be sufficient to distinguish between competing theories (or to determine a different theory that will unify both), as is the case with [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]].

Another example is provided by Goethe's [[Theory of Colours]] — "Newton believed that with the help of his prism experiments, he could prove that sunlight was composed of variously coloured rays of light. Goethe showed that this step from observation to theory is more problematic than Newton wanted to admit. By insisting that the step to theory is not forced upon us by the phenomena, Goethe revealed our own free, creative contribution to theory construction. And Goethe's insight is surprisingly significant, because he correctly claimed that all of the results of Newton's prism experiments fit a theoretical alternative equally well. If this is correct, then by suggesting an alternative to a well-established physical theory, Goethe developed the problem of underdetermination a century before Duhem and Quine's famous arguments." (Mueller, 2016)&lt;ref name="Mueller 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mueller | first = Olaf L. | title = Prismatic Equivalence – A New Case of Underdetermination: Goethe vs. Newton on the Prism Experiments, 2016/2 (n° 24) | publisher = British Journal for the History of Philosophy |date=2016 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09608788.2015.1132671}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] says of this — 'And I for one do not know how anyone, regardless of what his views about colours are, can deny that the theory in itself is fully consequent, that its assumptions, once granted, explain the facts treated completely and indeed simply'. (Helmholtz 1853)&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz, Hermann von. 1853. ''Goethes Vorahnungen kommender naturwissenschaftlicher Ideen''. Berlin: Pastel. 1971. Philosophische Vortrdge und Aufsdtze. Ed. H. Horz and S. Wollgast. Berlin: Akademie-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments involving underdetermination==
Arguments involving underdetermination attempt to show that there is no reason to believe some conclusion because it is underdetermined by the evidence.  Then, if the evidence available at a particular time can be equally well explained by at least one other hypothesis, there is no reason to believe it rather than the equally supported rival (although many other hypotheses may still be eliminated).

Because arguments involving underdetermination involve both a claim about what the evidence is and that such evidence underdetermines a conclusion, it is often useful to separate these two claims within the underdetermination argument as follows:
#All the available evidence of a certain type underdetermines which of several rival conclusions is correct.
#Only evidence of that type is relevant to believing one of these conclusions.
#Therefore, there is no evidence for believing one among the rival conclusions.
The first premise makes the claim that a theory is underdetermined. The second says that rational decision (i.e. using available evidence) depends upon insufficient evidence.

===Epistemological problem of the indeterminacy of data to theory===
Any phenomenon can be explained by a multiplicity of hypotheses.  How, then, can data ever be sufficient to prove a theory?  This is the "[[epistemology|epistemological]] problem of the indeterminacy of data to theory".

The [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument and [[W.V.O. Quine]]'s 1960 [[Indeterminacy of translation|'Gavagai' example]] are perhaps the most commented variants of the epistemological problem of the indeterminacy of data to theory.

===General skeptical arguments===

Some skeptical arguments appeal to the fact that no possible evidence could be incompatible with 'skeptical hypotheses' like the maintenance of a complex illusion by [[Descartes]]' evil demon or (in a modern version) the machines who run the [[The Matrix|Matrix]]. A skeptic may argue that this undermines any claims to [[knowledge]], or even (by internalist definitions), [[Theory of justification|justification]].

Philosophers have found this argument very powerful. [[David Hume|Hume]] felt it was unanswerable, but observed that it was in practice impossible to accept its conclusions. Influenced by this, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] held that while the nature of the '[[noumenal]]' world was indeed unknowable, we could aspire to knowledge of the '[[Phenomenon|phenomenal]]' world. A similar response has been advocated by modern [[anti-realist]]s.

Underdetermined ideas are not implied to be incorrect (taking into account present evidence); rather, we cannot know if they are correct.

===Philosophy of science===
In the [[philosophy of science]], underdetermination is often presented as a problem for [[scientific realism]], which holds that we have reason to believe in entities that are not directly observable (such as electrons) talked about by scientific theories.  One such argument proceeds as follows:  &lt;!-- Perhaps we should add somewhere that in some sense, underdeterminism must be true, since even if one theory is determined by the evidence, one can always and in an infinity of ways trivially modify it (even if only to specify something in the future), yielding an infinity of theories. --&gt;
#All the available observational evidence for such entities underdetermines the claims of a scientific theory about such entities.
#Only the observational evidence is relevant to believing a scientific theory.
#Therefore, there is no evidence for believing what scientific theories say about such entities.

Particular responses to this argument attack both the first and the second premise (1 and 2).  It is argued against the first premise that the underdetermination must be strong and/or inductive. It is argued against the second premise that there is evidence for a theory's truth besides observations; for example, it is argued that simplicity, [[Explanatory power|explanatory power]] or some other feature of a theory is evidence for it over its rivals.

A more general response from the scientific realist is to argue that underdetermination is no special problem for science, because, as indicated earlier in this article, all knowledge that is directly or indirectly supported by evidence suffers from it—for example, conjectures concerning unobserved observables.  It is therefore too powerful an argument to have any significance in the philosophy of science, since it does not cast doubt uniquely on conjectured unobservables.

'''Yamas''' ({{lang-sa|यम}}), and its complement, [[Niyama]]s, represent a series of "right living" or ethical rules within [[Hinduism]] and [[Yoga]]. It means "reining in" or "control". These are restraints for Proper Conduct as given in the [[Veda|Holy Veda]]. They are a form of moral imperatives, commandments, rules or goals. The ''Yamas'' are the "don't do these" list of self-restraints, typically representing commitments that affect one's relations with others and self.&lt;ref name=lasater42/&gt; The complementary Niyamas represent the "do these" list of observances, and together Yamas and Niyamas are personal obligations to live well.&lt;ref name=lasater42&gt;Judith Lasater (1998), Beginning the Journey, Yoga Journal, Nov-Dec Issue, pages 42-48&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest mention of the word ''Yamas'' is in the [[Rigveda]], and over fifty texts of Hinduism, from its various traditions, discuss Yamas.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt; [[Patañjali]] lists five ''yamas'' in his [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sūtras]]. Ten yamas are codified as "the restraints" in numerous Hindu texts including Yajnavalkya Smriti in verse 3.313,&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsyamas/&gt; the Śāṇḍilya and [[Vārāha Upanishad]]s, the ''[[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]'' by Svātmārāma,&lt;ref name="svatmaram" /&gt; and the [[Tirumantiram]] of [[Tirumular]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga for the three stages of life|first=Sŕivatsa |last=Ramaswami|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sUzBl2k7Z98C|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Company|year=2001|

Ten ''yamas'' are codified in numerous scriptures, including the Hatha Yoga Pradeepika compiled by Yogi Swatmarama, while Patanjali lists five ''yamas'' and five ''niyamas'' (disciplines) in the Yoga Sutra.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most often mentioned Yamas are – [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[Satya]] (non-falsehood, truthfulness), [[Asteya]] (non-stealing), [[Mitahara]] (non-excess in food, moderation in food), [[Kshama|Kṣamā]] (non-agitation about suffering, forgiveness), [[Compassion#Hinduism|Dayā]] (non-prejudgment, compassion) are among the widely discussed Yamas.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt; The Yamas apply broadly and include self-restraints in one's actions, words and thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Weiss (2006), Ahimsa: Nonviolence from a Yoga Perspective, Fellowship, Vol. 72, Issue 1-2, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
The earliest mention of ''Yamas'' is found in the Hindu scripture Rigveda, such as in verse 5.61.2.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsyamas&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, Sanskrit English Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, Entry for Yama, page 846&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: क्व वोऽश्वाः क्वाभीशवः कथं शेक कथा यय । पृष्ठे सदो नसो'''र्यमः''' ॥२॥ ([https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_५.६१ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं ५.६१] Rigveda, Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; The word in the Rigveda means a "rein, curb", the act of checking or curbing, restraining such as by a charioteer or a driver.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsyamas/&gt; The term evolves into a moral restraint and ethical duty in the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Dharmasutra]]s, the [[Mahabharata]] and numerous later texts, where it means self-control, voluntary and inner-directed forbearance.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsyamas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palmer and Stanley Burgess (2012), The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Religion and Social Justice, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|978-1405195478}}, page 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Yamas is the [[Sanskrit]] word for "restraint," states Stephen Sturgess, particularly "from actions, words, or thoughts that may cause harm".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yoga Meditation: Still Your Mind and Awaken Your Inner Spirit|last=Sturgess|first=Stephen|publisher=Watkins Publishing Limited|year=2014|isbn=978-1-78028-644-0|location=Oxford, UK|pages=18–19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other numbers==
At least sixty (60) ancient and medieval era Indian texts are known so far that discuss ''Yamas''.&lt;ref name=svb&gt;SV Bharti (2001), ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'': With the Exposition of Vyasa, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120818255}}, Appendix I, pages 672-680&lt;/ref&gt; Most are in Sanskrit, but some are in regional Indian languages. Of the sixty, the lists in eleven of these texts are similar, but not the same, as that of Patanjali's.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt; Other texts list between 1 and 10 ''Yamas'', however 10 is the most common.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt;

The order of listed yamas, the names and nature of each yamas, as well as the relative emphasis vary between the texts. Some texts use the reverse of ''[[Niyama]]s'' in other texts, as Yamas; for example, ''Vairagya'' (dispassion from hedonism, somewhat reverse of the niyama ''Tapas'') is described in verse 33 of Trishikhi Brahmana Upanishad in its list for Yamas.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt; Many texts substitute one or more different concepts in their list of ''Yamas''. For example, in the ten ''Yamas'' listed by Yatidharma Sangraha, [[Akrodha]] (non-anger) is included as a ''Yamas''.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt; Ahirbudhnya Samhita in verse 31.19 and Darshana Upanishad in verses 1.14-15 include ''[[Compassion#Hinduism|Dayā]]'' as a Yamas, and explain it as the ethical restraint of not jumping to conclusions, being compassionate to every being and considering suffering of others as one's own.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Varenne and Coltman Derek (1977), University Of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226851167}}, pages 197-202&lt;/ref&gt; In verse 31.21, Ahirbudhnya Samhita includes [[Kshama|Kṣamā]] as the virtue of forgiveness and restraint from continued agitation from wrong others have done.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt; Mahakala Samhita in verses II.11.723 through II.11.738&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskritdocuments.org/scannedbooks/forencoding/mahAkAlISamhitaGuhyakalikhandaPart2.pdf Mahakala Samhita] Government of India Archives (in Sanskrit), see pages 302 to 304 of the document&lt;/ref&gt; lists many of the 10 ''Yamas'' above, but explains why it is a virtue in a different way. For example, the text explains ''Dayā'' (or Dayaa) is an ethical precept and the restraint from too much and too little emotions. It suggests ''Dayā'' reflects one's inner state, is the expression of kindness towards kin, friend, stranger and even a hostile person, and that one must remain good and kind no matter what the circumstances. This view for the Yamas of ''Dayā'' is shared in Shandilya Upanishad and Jabala Darshana Upanishad.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. V. Gajendragadkar (2007), Neo-upanishadic Philosophy, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, University of California Archives, {{oclc|1555808}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atri Samhita in verse 48, lists ''Anrshamsya'' (आनृशंस्य)&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=AnRzaMsya+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU AnRzaMsya] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; as the restraint from cruelty to any living being by one's actions, words or in thoughts. Shivayoga Dipika in verse 2.9 substitutes ''Sunrta'' for ''Satya'', defining Sunrta as "sweet and true speech".&lt;ref name=svb/&gt;

[[Ahimsa]], [[Satya]], [[Asteya]], [[Mitahara]], [[Kshama|Kṣamā]], [[Compassion#Hinduism|Dayā]] are among the widely discussed Yamas ethical concepts by majority of these texts.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt;

==Related concepts==
Yamas are related to [[Niyama]]s in ancient and medieval era Indian texts. The former are restraints (the "don'ts") of virtuous life, while the latter are observances (the "dos").

Some texts such as the Hatha Yoga Pradipika use the classification flexibly, where yamas (restraints, the "don'ts") are understood as reverse of niyamas (positive attitudes, behaviors, the "dos").

'''Yossi Dahan''' (born 1954) is a law professor and the Head of the [[Human Rights]] Division at the College of Law and Business.  He is the chairperson and cofounder of [[Adva Center]], an editor and cofounder of Haokets.org, and teaches philosophy at the [[Open University]]. Dahan is an expert in [[labor law]], workers' rights and [[global justice]], theories of [[social justice]], the right to education and educational [[justice]].

==Biography==
Yossi Dahan was born in [[Morocco]] and immigrated to [[Israel]] in 1960. His family lived at first at the [[Beit Shemesh]] transition camp (ma'abara) and later at the [[Bat Yam]] transition camp, from which it moved to [[Holon]] where he graduated from the Kugel High School.
 
Dahan studied for a BA in philosophy and psychology at [[Tel Aviv University]]. In 1976-1979, he moved to the [[United States]] to continue his studies and completed his PhD studies at [[New York City]]'s [[Columbia University]]. His PhD thesis was titled "Political Equality in Democratic Theories", supervised by Thomas Pogge and Sidney Morgenbesser. Dahan received his law degree in 1999 at the College of Management Academic Studies (COMAS) in [[Rishon LeZion]], Israel.

Dahan is an associate professor at the Department of Law at the College of Law and Business, where he is also Head of the Human Rights Division. He is also Philosophy and Political Science Teaching Coordinator at the Open University.

In 2006 Dahan was a research associate at [[Oxford University]]’s Centre for the Study of Social Justice, and in 2011-2012, he was a visiting scholar at New York University’s Taub Center for Israel Studies.

Dahan cofounded [[Adva Center]] for Information on Equality and Social Justice in Israel and has been its acting chair ever since. In 2003, together with Dr. Yitzhak Saporta, he founded the Haokets website – a critical platform on socioeconomic, political, media, cultural and other issues, and has been editing and writing in it ever since. Dahan has acted as a public representative of workers at the National Labor Court.

Since 2003, he has been a member of the editorial board of Van Leer Jerusalem Institute’s Theory and Criticism journal.  In 2005-2009, Dahan chaired Van Leer’s research groups on Class and Identity. He is a board member in the Association of Environmental Justice in Israel, and a member of the general assembly and board of the College of Law and Business.

In 1992-1996, Dahan served as a member of the academic team consulting Minister of [[Labour economics|Labor]] and [[Social Welfare]] [[Ora Namir]]. In July 1989, he was a member of the Mizrahi delegation for the Toledo Meeting for Israeli-Palestinian Dialogue, and later of the delegation for the negotiations with the PLO in [[Stockholm]] in 1990.

In 1992-1993, together with Professor Yossi Yonah, Yitzhak Shapira and Yael Fishbein, Dahan headed the education team of the Special Committee for Social Development in [[Yitzhak Rabin]]’s Prime Minister’s Office.  He cofounded the Forum for Social Justice and Peace which operated in the late 1980s and early 1990s under the auspices of the International Center for Peace. The Forum held training programs for community leaders for mixed populations: [[Arabs]] and [[Jews]], residents of cities and development towns, new immigrants and long-time residents. As part of his activities at the Forum, Dahan and Professor Yossi Yonah headed the academic steering committee of its training programs. Dahan cofounded the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition. Dahan had opinion columns in the Hadashot and Yediot Ahronot daily newspapers.

Yossi is married to Miri, a graphic designer, and has three children: Ayelet, Nili and Noam.

Dahan’s book Theories of Social Justice was first published in Hebrew by the Ministry of Defense Publications in 2007. The book provides an extensive and critical review of major contemporary social justice theories ([[John Rawls]]’s theory of justice, libertarianism, Amartya K. Sen’s and Martha Nussbaum’s capability approach, desert theories of justice, Michael Walzer’s theory of justice, global justice, justice and feminism, and justice and multiculturalism). An updated, extended edition of the book, with a new chapter on justice and democracy, was published in Hebrew by the Open University in 2013.

Dahan wrote the postscript to the [[Hebrew]] translation of Rawls’s 1985 Justice as Fairness, published in 2011 by Books in the Attic and Miskal.

Since 2008, Dahan is involved in a series of studies on workers' rights in international labor law in collaboration with Dr. Hanna Lerner of the [[Tel Aviv]] University Department of Political Science and Dr. Faina Milman-Sivan of the [[Haifa University]] Department of Law. This normative and empirical research project develops a theory of shared responsibility and principles of responsibility allocation designed to justify the protection of workers'  rights in global chains of productions controlled by multinational corporations. The project is funded by the Israeli Science Fund (ISF). Hitherto, it has led to the publication of several articles in legal and philosophical journal. In early 2015, a collection of articles edited by the researchers will be published by [[Cambridge University]] Press under the title International Labor Rights and Global Justice. In 2009, together with Dr. Milman-Sivan, Dahan also edited a special edition the Law &amp; Ethics of Human Rights journal, titled “Labor Rights in an Era of Globalization”.

In the course of his studies on education, Dahan published a series of articles on equal opportunities and privatization in Israeli and international journals. Among other things, he published several articles together with Professor Yossi Yonah of [[Ben Gurion University]] in the Negev describing and critiquing ideological and normative aspects of the neoliberal reforms carried out since the 1980s in education systems in Israel and many other countries.

In the last few years, Dahan has been working on a book which examines three key issues in education systems from normative and empirical perspectives: equal opportunities, [[privatization]], and the issue of mandatory core curriculum. The book is planned for publication in 2015.

Finally, together with Professor Henry Wasserman, Dahan edited To Invent a [[Nation]] – a collection of articles on modern theories of nationality. The book was published in Hebrew in 2006 by the Open University as part of a series in the course Issues in the Study of [[Nationalism]], together with Hebrew translations of Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities, Ernst Gellner’s Nations and Nationalism, and Partha Chatterjee’s Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World: A Derivative Discourse.

'''Étienne''' ('''Stephen''') '''Tempier''' ({{IPA-fr|tɑ̃pje|lang}}; also known as '''Stephanus of Orleans'''; died 3 September 1279) was a French [[bishop of Paris]] during the 13th century. He was [[Chancellor of the University of Paris|Chancellor]] of the [[Sorbonne]] from 1263 and bishop of Paris from 1268.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Light and the Dark: A Cultural History of Dualism |first=Petrus Franciscus Maria |last=Fontaine |location=Amsterdam |publisher=J.C. Gibben |year=2006 |page=181 |isbn=90-70265-40-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best remembered for promulgating a [[Condemnations (University of Paris)|Condemnation]] of 219 [[philosophical]] and [[theological]] propositions (or articles) that addressed  concepts that were being   disputed in the faculty of arts at the [[University of Paris]].

==Life==
Born in [[Orléans]], Tempier studied in [[Paris]], where he became master of theology and canon of Notre Dame.  During a period of about five years (1263–ca. 1268), Tempier was the [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|Chancellor]] of the chapter of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] at Paris, succeeding Erich von Veire.  At that time, the Chancellor of the Chapter was also the [[Chancellor of the University of Paris]].

He served as bishop of Paris from 7 October 1268 until his death on 3 September 1279. Tempier had been a master in the faculty of [[theology]].

==Condemnations==
In 1270 Tempier, encouraged by [[Henry of Ghent]] (died 1293), had issued a formal condemnation of thirteen doctrines held by "radical [[Aristotelians]]."  These included the unity of intellect, causal necessity, and the eternity of the world. Further investigation into perceived errors then prevalent at the  university was prompted by the Portuguese cleric Juliani, who was elected [[Pope John XXI]] on 13 September 1276.&lt;ref name=John&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Mediæval Philosophy |first=Maurice |last=de Wulf |location=New York |publisher=Nelson |year=1951 |page=356 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A former professor of theology at the University of Paris, he wrote Tempier on 28 January 1277.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle's Children: How Christians, Muslims, and Jews Rediscovered Ancient Wisdom and Illuminated the Middle Ages |first=Richard E. |last=Rubenstein |location=Orlando |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |year=2004 |page=231 |isbn=0-15-603009-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pope told Tempier that he had heard reports of heretical opinions in the Paris area, and requested to be informed of the situation. By this time Tempier was already investigating possible heretical opinions at the University of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science and Religion, 400 BC to AD 1550: from Aristotle to Copernicus |first=Edward |last=Grant |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |page=181 |isbn=0-8018-8401-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 1277, Tempier expanded the number of condemned doctrines to 219.  He was assisted by a commission of theologians from the University. Henry of Ghent sat on  Tempier's episcopal commission (''assessores episcopi'') of sixteen masters, which produced the syllabus of 219 propositions condemned by Tempier on 7 March 1277. The condemnations against [[Aristotelianism]] in Paris involved [[Giles of Rome]], [[Siger of Brabant]], the arts faculty, and certain doctrines of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval Philosophy |first=John |last=Marenbon |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |page=291 |isbn=0-415-05377-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The forty-ninth item on the list was the assertion that God is incapable of moving the universe because it implies the existence of a void.&lt;ref name=black/&gt;

Tempier also overturned [[Aristotle]] on one point: [[God]] could have created more than one world (given His omnipotence) yet we know by revelation He made only one. Tempier's stress on God's omnipotence also opened up all kinds of possibilities for the understanding of the cosmos. In his effort to defend the abilities and unique rights of the Creator, Tempier's propositions led to the new approach taken to understand the workings of celestial and terrestrial bodies.  By rejecting that astral bodies were animated, incorruptible and eternal, refuting the idea that their motion was the result of something comparable to animal desires and denying that stars had any influence over individuals, he showed that Christians were prepared to refute Aristotle's world view along with some basic assumptions held by Greek learning.

It is  not clear what Tempier's intentions were in issuing this condemnation. Nevertheless, scholars have written that "the Parisian Condemnation of 1277 is symbolic of an intellectual crisis in the University. It is indicative of fundamental shifts in speculative thought and cultural perception which occurred in the late 13th century,  which portend aspects of modern thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kent, Jr. |last=Emery |first2=Andreas |last2=Speer |chapter=After the Condemnation of 1277: New Evidence, New Perspectives, and Grounds for New Interpretations |title=Nach der Verurteilung von 1277: Philosophie und Theologie an der Universität von Paris im letzten Viertel des 13.

==Opposition to and repeal==

Tempier's prohibitions did not curtail the free discussion of [[Thomist]] doctrines and did little to limit their influence at the University of Paris.&lt;ref name=John/&gt;
His decree was actively opposed and eventually overturned in 1325.&lt;ref name=black&gt;''The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace: A History of Space from [[Dante]] to the Internet'', Margaret Wertheim, [[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]], 2000, pg. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;
