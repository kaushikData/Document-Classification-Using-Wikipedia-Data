'''Association Pesinet''' is a French NGO, founded in late 2007, that leverages [[information and communication technology|ICT]] and mobile agents to improve detection and early treatment of childhood diseases in [[Mali]]. The service combines frequent [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] of simple health indicators with an affordable insurance system and education on [[preventive medicine|preventive health]] practices.

==History==

Pesinet was founded in 2007 and launched activities in Mali in 2009, after a formal agreement was signed between Pesinet and Mali’s Health Ministry for the implementation and evaluation of the pilot site.&lt;ref&gt;Pesinet, Mobile Tech and Microinsurance for Child Health in Mali. July 10, 2010 {{cite web|url=http://mobileactive.org/case-studies/pesinet-mobile-technology-and-child-health-mali |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720105824/http://mobileactive.org/case-studies/pesinet-mobile-technology-and-child-health-mali |archivedate=2012-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first program was launched in January 2010 during an official ceremony attended by the Health Minister. It covers the neighbourhoods of [[Bamako]] Coura and Bamako Coura Bolibana.&lt;ref&gt;"Pesinet s'installe en CIII du district de Bamako", L'Independent, January 2010. http://www.pesinet.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Independant110110.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304224305/http://www.pesinet.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Independant110110.pdf# |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A propos de Pesinet." Santé Tropicale, January 22, 2012. http://www.santetropicale.com/mali/edit0110.htm{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, and at the request of the two community health centers in Dravela and Ouolofobougou, two neighboring districts of Bamako Coura, Pesinet began to work on the extension of its activities in these two areas. The launch of the two new programs was made official during a ceremony that took place in October 2011, during which the partnership agreement with the community health centers was officially signed.&lt;ref&gt;Pesinet Activity Report, 2011, page 7, http://www.pesinet.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Association-Pesinet_Rapport-annuel-2011.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081008/http://www.pesinet.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Association-Pesinet_Rapport-annuel-2011.pdf# |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and Founding Principles==

The mission of Association Pesinet is to sustainably reduce infant and [[child mortality]] by facilitating access of populations to existing healthcare systems. In partnership with local health centers, Pesinet designs and deploys home-based health monitoring services for children and mothers.

Pesinet’s action is motivated by the following facts:

*In Mali, the under-5 mortality rate is 178 per 1000, meaning nearly 1 in 5 children does not reach the age of 5 ;&lt;ref&gt;"Mali." UNICEF. N.p., n.d. Web. 31 Aug. 2012. &lt;http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/mali_statistics.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
*More than 59% of deaths among young children are due to complications of minor illnesses such as diarrhea, [[malaria]], and [[pneumonia]] ;&lt;ref&gt;Countdown to 2015: Maternal, Newborn and Child survival. Mali profile. http://www.healthynewbornnetwork.org/sites/default/files/resources/mali.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Yet these illnesses are easily detectable and can be treated with the medical means available locally in primary health structures called Community Health Centers (in French, les Centres de Santé Communautaires or CSCOMs) ;
*For cultural, geographical, or financial reasons, families do not go to the doctor at the first sign of symptoms.  In Mali, people visit a health structure on average 0.24 times per year. Simple illnesses are therefore not detected or treated in time, leading to costly emergency medical treatment and unnecessary fatalities; meanwhile the underused CSCOMs experience financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Véronique de Keyser, European Parliament draft report on healthcare systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. June 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding principles of the organization are:

*Work in close partnership with the local healthcare structures and the health authorities in Mali in order to integrate into and reinforce the public health system;
*Encourage prevention and rebuild the link between the population and the healthcare system;
*Use technology to facilitate monitoring of a large number of children; rapid disease detection and early care;
*Ask for a financial contribution from the beneficiaries in order to ensure the economic viability of the service and adhere to national policies governing the financing of the healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;Pesinet "Principes d'action." http://www.pesinet.org/wp/fr/2009/10/founding-idea/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the service works==

The service is based on the voluntary enrollment of families and costs 500 [[CFA franc|FCFA]]/child per month, or less than 1 euro. For this price, families are entitled to regular home visit by the health agents as well as free doctor consultations and 50% reduction on medications. Pesinet agents visit families several times each month to examine children, collect key data (weight, cough, fever, diarrhea…) and enter it in an application on a mobile phone. The data collected by the agents is transmitted in real time to a database accessible by the doctors at the closest health center. Doctors at the health center read that data and summon children at risk through the responsible health agent.&lt;ref&gt;"A Bamako, la santé au bout du fil." Liberation, N.p., 23 Dec. 2011. Web. 29 Oct. 2012. &lt;http://www.liberation.fr/monde/01012379225-a-bamako-la-sante-est-au-bout-du-fil/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of families enrolled in the program found that 94% of subscribers were satisfied with the service and 97% of them found it affordable.&lt;ref&gt;MICROCAPITAL BRIEF: Pesinet Brings Microinsurance, Health Monitoring to Children in Mali.

The '''Bradfield Scheme''', a proposed Australian water diversion scheme, is an inland [[irrigation]] project that was designed to irrigate and [[drought]]-proof much of the [[Central West Queensland|western]] [[Queensland]] interior, as well as large areas of [[South Australia]]. It was devised by [[John Bradfield (engineer)|Dr John Bradfield]] (1867–1943),&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Spearritt|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070391b.htm|title=Bradfield, John Job Crew (1867 - 1943)|work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|volume=Vol. 7|publisher=Melbourne University Press|date=1979|pages=381–383}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Queensland born [[civil engineer]], who also designed the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and Brisbane's [[Story Bridge, Brisbane|Story Bridge]]. Some people considered the plan to be lacking in scientific justification,&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; excessively expensive, and overly optimistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/Images/wateringinland_tcm2-2982.pdf|type=PDF|title="Suggested Answer" to question-without-notice of the Prime Minister, explaining the impracticality of the Bradfield Scheme|date=14 November 1946|accessdate=|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme that Bradfield proposed in 1938 required large [[pipeline transport|pipes]], tunnels, pumps and dams. It involved diverting water from the upper reaches of the [[Tully River|Tully]], [[Herbert River|Herbert]] and [[Burdekin River|Burdekin]] rivers.&lt;ref name="awr"/&gt;  These Queensland rivers are fed by the monsoon, and flow east to the [[Coral Sea]]. It was proposed that the water would enter the [[Thomson River, Queensland|Thomson River]] on the western side of the [[Great Dividing Range]] and eventually flow south west to [[Lake Eyre]].&lt;ref name="oct1938"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38731715 |title=Augmenting Queensland's Inland Water Resources by J.J.C. Bradfield. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=1 October 1938 |accessdate=7 December 2010 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative plan was to divert water into the [[Flinders River]].

There have been no attempts to implement the scheme, although the plan is raised from time to time.

==Possible benefits==
[[File:Bradfield Scheme irrigation area.JPG|thumb|Bradfield Scheme irrigation area]]
The water was expected to provide irrigation for more than {{convert|3000|mi2}} of agricultural land in Queensland.&lt;ref name="ibwt"/&gt; The scheme would reduce the massive natural [[erosion]] problems in areas of Central Queensland.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The scheme had the ability to generate {{convert|370|MW}} of power and the potential to double that amount.&lt;ref name="ibwt"/&gt; Controlling and reducing the flow of northern rivers into the ocean may benefit the [[Great Barrier Reef]] as fresh water causes [[coral bleaching]], and the excess [[nutrient]]s in the rivers from coastal farming and development support algal growth that can harm the reef.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

It is claimed that extra water and [[vegetation]] in the interior may then produce changes to the [[climate of Australia]], however various studies have concluded that this is unlikely.&lt;ref name="amm"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hope|first=P |author2=N Nicholls |author3=JL McGregor |title=The rainfall response to permanent inland water in Australia |journal=Australian Meteorological Magazine |year=2004|volume=53 |url=http://www.acohotselles.info/amm/docs/2004/hope_hres.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may increase the rainfall in areas of southern Queensland and northern [[New South Wales]]. Extra rainfall may drought-proof Eastern Queensland, and thereby improve river inflows to the [[Murray-Darling Basin|Murray-Darling River system]].  It is claimed that a full Lake Eyre would moderate the air temperature in the region by the absorption of sunlight by the water instead of heat radiation from dry land into the air. No evidence to support the theory that an inland sea would increase rainfall has ever been produced,&lt;ref name="awr"/&gt; nor have any of the other claims been supported.

It would provide large areas suitable for the production of [[algae fuel]], a type of biofuel.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  The catchment area of the Herbert River holds a population of approximately 18,000, 75% of whom dwell in the lower flood plain area. Diverting some water from this river would reduce the risk of flood.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Objections==
Bradfield's scheme and others have been criticised because they are not practical.&lt;ref name="awr"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia's Water Resources: From use to management |last=Pigram |first=John J. |year=2007 |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Collingwood, Victoria |isbn=978-0-643-09442-0 |page=59 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 March 2011 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme has been criticised because of the high capital and ongoing running costs which would make the project uneconomic.

Elevation measurements were taken with a [[barometer]], leading to inaccuracies in land heights and mistakes in the proposal.&lt;ref name="ibwt"&gt;{{cite book |title=Inter-basin water transfer: case studies from Australia, United States, Canada, China, and India |last=Ghassemi |first=Fereidoun |author2=White, Ian |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |isbn=0-521-86969-2 |pages=125–129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EBM2a6R9igC |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases no flow record of the rivers were available to Bradfield. He used an empirical formula which assumed 33% of the water flow would be lost to evaporation and seepage. The estimated water available for the scheme was {{convert|114|m3/s}}.&lt;ref name="ibwt"/&gt;

The extreme [[evaporation]] rate in the interior is another negative determinant. No clear evidence has been provided that the amount of water supplied will exceed the evaporation rate. The reduction in river discharge to the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon may diminish coastal fisheries by reducing the supply of terrestrial organic matter to the coastal and estuarine environment.

In 1947, W.H.R. Nimmo, conducted a critical review of the scheme.&lt;ref name="ibwt"/&gt;  He proved that Bradfield's estimates of the amount of water available from the easterly flowing rivers were about two and half times greater than it actually was.  The error was attributed to the methodology used to calculate flow estimates was based on German rivers where the average temperature was much less than in northern Australia.&lt;ref name="ibwt"/&gt;

==Support==
The Bradfield Scheme has not received broad political support from any of the major Australian parties in recent times however it has been pushed by individual politicians such as [[Bob Katter]] who advocated the plan whilst he was a member of the [[National Party of Australia|Nationals]] for the state seat of [[Electoral district of Flinders (Queensland)|Flinders]] during the 1980s and continues to support it as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]], representing the federal seat of [[Division of Kennedy|Kennedy]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In February 2007, the then [[Premier of Queensland|Queensland Premier]] [[Peter Beattie]] urged the Federal Government to look at a modern version, saying it is better to find more water than to cut back on current supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=19 February 2007|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-02-19/water-war-fears-over-resurrected-bradfield-scheme/2198028|title='Water war' fears over resurrected Bradfield scheme|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|location=Australia|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this, the scheme is often amongst the policies of a number of minor parties and independent candidates. A modified scheme was also strongly supported by Selwyn Johnston, an independent candidate for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] representing Queensland at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnston-independent.com/bradfield_scheme.html The Bradfield Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814112642/http://www.johnston-independent.com/bradfield_scheme.html |date=14 August 2004 }} – Australia's Next Great National Project – A National Water Grid, Selwyn Johnson, Independent Senate candidate.  &lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Watts, a [[Citizens Electoral Council]] candidate for the federal seat of [[Division of Bass|Bass]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]] stated that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adrianforbass.com/pages/policy/water/water_projects_map.pdf New Great Water Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707091509/http://www.adrianforbass.com/pages/policy/water/water_projects_map.pdf |date=7 July 2011 }}.

On 14 August 2018, [[Senator]] [[Fraser Anning]] indicated support for the scheme during his [[maiden speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlview.aph.gov.au/mediaPlayer.php?videoID=410935|title=Senate [Part 1] - 14/08/2018 11:54:59 – Parliament of Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=parlview.aph.gov.au|language=en|format=Video with audio|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article deals with activities of the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] related to [[transnational organized crime|transnational crime]], including the illicit drug trade.

Two offices of the [[Central Intelligence Agency#Directorate of Intelligence|CIA Directorate of Intelligence]] have analytical responsibilities in this area. The  Office of Transnational Issues&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation 
| url= https://www.cia.gov/offices-of-cia/intelligence-analysis/organization-1/oti.html 
| title =Office of Transnational Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt; applies unique functional expertise to assess existing and emerging threats to US national security and provides the most senior US policymakers, military planners, and law enforcement with analysis, warning, and crisis support.

The [[IOC/AG|CIA Crime and Narcotics Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.cia.gov/offices-of-cia/intelligence-analysis/organization-1/the-cia-crime-and-narcotics-center.html 
| title = CIA Crime and Narcotics Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; researches information on [[illegal drug trade|international narcotics trafficking]] and [[organized crime]] for policymakers and the law enforcement community. Since the CIA has no domestic police authority, it sends its analytic information to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and other law enforcement organizations, such as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) and the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] (OFAC).

Another part of the CIA, the [[National Clandestine Service]], collects human intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) in these areas.

==Drug trade==
According to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODOC),

&lt;blockquote&gt;Drug cultivation thrives on instability, corruption and poor governance. The world's biggest drug producing centres are in regions beyond the control of the central government, like South Afghanistan, South-West Colombia and East Myanmar. Until government control, democracy and the rule of law are restored, these regions will remain nests of insurgency and drug production—and represent the biggest challenge to containment.&lt;ref name="WorldDrug2007"&gt;{{Citation
 | title = World Drug Report 2007
 | author = United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime
 | url = http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2007.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Especially in developing countries in conflict, there have been allegations that the CIA assisted the illicit drug activities of local leaders who saw that as a payment for their assistance.

===Counternarcotics mission===

CIA publishes reference materials in this area, such as "Heroin Movement Worldwide".&lt;ref name="CIA-HeroinMvt-2007"&gt;{{citation

{{CIA supported a reevaluation of US antidrug priorities by the President's [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] by publishing a paper that addressed the strategic vulnerabilities of the global drug trade.  The paper addressed the exploitable operational, logistical, financial, and geographic weakness of the many criminal enterprises that supply narcotics to the United States and other markets.  The paper was well received by the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and he instructed the law enforcement community to use it as a template to craft a companion product addressing the vulnerabilities of the US domestic drug trade.

CIA analysts wrote the first-ever analysis of drug flows and consumption in Brazil, the world's second-largest consumer of cocaine after the United States.  The study entailed open-source field collection and an innovative methodology for calculating the prevalence of drug use.&lt;ref name="CIAvsDrug"&gt;{{citation

===Latin America===
{{Main|CIA and Contra's cocaine trafficking in the US}}
There have been allegations that CIA was involved in the Latin American drug trade, possibly to finance operations in [[Nicaragua]] and other areas where Congress had denied funding, such as  Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion, and in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.  According to a personal account by [[Everett Ellis Briggs]], former U.S. Ambassador to Panama and Honduras, CIA undermined efforts to put a stop to the drug smuggling activities of Panamanian dictator [[Manuel Noriega]] prior to the December, 1989 [[U.S. invasion of Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Iran-Contra related====
Released on April 13, 1989, the [[Kerry Committee report]] found that the U.S. State Department had assisted drug traffickers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;who provided support for the Contras were involved in drug trafficking ... and elements of the Contras themselves knowingly received financial and material assistance from drug traffickers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of these payments were after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges or while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report declared, "It is clear that individuals who provided support for the Contras were involved in drug trafficking ... and elements of the Contras themselves knowingly received financial and material assistance from drug traffickers."&lt;ref name="white" /&gt;

Representative [[Maxine Waters]] testified to Congress:

{{quote|Senator Kerry and his Senate investigation found drug traffickers had used the Contra war and tie to the Contra leadership to help this trade. Among their findings, the [[Kerry Committee report|Kerry committee investigators]] found that traffickers used the Contra supply networks and the traffickers provided support for Contras in return. The CIA created, trained, supported, and directed the Contras and were involved in every level of their war.&lt;ref name = "water"&gt;{{Citation

In 1996, [[investigative journalist]] [[Gary Webb]] wrote a series of articles for the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' entitled, "Dark Alliance", in which he reported evidence that CIA aircraft, which had ferried arms to the [[Nicaragua]]n ''[[Contras]],'' had been used to ship [[cocaine]] to the United States on their return flights. In 1998 the new DCI, [[George Tenet]], declared that he was releasing the report.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report of  CIA [[Inspector General]] [[Frederick Hitz]] and Hitz's testimony showed that the "CIA did not 'expeditiously' cut off relations with alleged drug traffickers" and "the CIA was aware of allegations that 'dozens of people and a number of companies connected in some fashion to the contra program' were involved in drug trafficking"&lt;ref name="white" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "WP"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitz also said that under an agreement in 1982 between [[Ronald Reagan]]'s Attorney General [[William French Smith]] and the CIA, agency officers were not required to report allegations of drug trafficking involving non-employees, which was defined as meaning paid and non-paid "assets [meaning agents], pilots who ferried supplies to the contras, as well as contra officials and others.&lt;ref name = "WP" /&gt; This agreement was revealed, at a time when there were allegations that the CIA was using drug dealers in its covert operation to bring down the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name = "WP" /&gt;  Only after Congressional funds were restored in 1986 was the agreement modified to require the CIA to stop paying agents whom it believed were involved in the drug trade.&lt;ref name="white" /&gt;

Webb also alleged that [[Central American]] [[Illegal drug trade|narcotics traffickers]] could distribute cocaine in U.S. cities in the 1980s without the interference of normal law enforcement agencies, and that the CIA intervened to prevent the prosecution of drug dealers who were helping to fund the ''Contras''.  The ''Mercury News'' ultimately retracted Webb's conclusions, and Webb was not authorized to conduct any further investigative reporting. Webb was transferred to cover non-controversial suburban stories and subsequently gave up journalism and committed suicide.

=====Nicaragua 1984=====
In 1984, U.S. officials began receiving reports of Contra cocaine trafficking.  Three officials told journalists that they considered these reports "reliable."  Former Panamanian deputy health minister Dr. [[Hugo Spadafora]], who had fought with the Contra army, outlined charges of cocaine trafficking to a prominent Panamanian official and was later found murdered.  The charges linked the Contra trafficking to [[Sebastian Gonzalez Mendiola]], who was charged with cocaine trafficking on November 26, 1984, in Costa Rica.

=====Nicaragua 1983=====

On March 16, 1986, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' published a report on the "1983 seizure of 430 pounds of cocaine from a Colombian freighter" in San Francisco which indicated that a "cocaine ring in the San Francisco Bay area helped finance Nicaragua's Contra rebels."  Carlos Cabezas, convicted of conspiracy to traffic cocaine, said that the profits from his crimes "belonged to ... the Contra revolution." He told the Examiner, "I just wanted to get the Communists out of my country."  Julio Zavala, also convicted on trafficking charges, said "that he supplied $500,000 to two Costa Rican-based Contra groups and that the majority of it came from cocaine trafficking in the San Francisco Bay area, Miami and New Orleans."&lt;ref name="AP1986-03-16"&gt;{{citation
 | title = Report: Cocaine Ring Finances Contras
 | author = Associated Press 
 | date = March 16, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former CIA agent [[David MacMichael]] explained the inherent relationship between CIA activity in Latin America and drug trafficking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once you set up a covert operation to supply arms and money, it's very difficult to separate it from the kind of people who are involved in other forms of trade, and especially drugs. There is a limited number of planes, pilots and landing strips. By developing a system for supply of the Contras, the US built a road for drug supply into the US.&lt;ref name="Ind1989-08-26"&gt;{{citation

====1990 Colombian counternarcotics blowback====
In November 1996, shortly after then-CIA Director [[John Deutsch]] went to Los Angeles to refute allegations raised by the [[Gary Webb]] investigative report on cocaine trafficking and the CIA, a [[Miami]] jury indicted Venezuelan CIA asset, General [[Ramon Guillen Davila]], who "led a CIA counter-narcotics program that put a ton of cocaine on U.S. streets in 1990."  ''The New York Times'' reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The CIA—over the objections of the Drug Enforcement Administration, a branch of the Justice Department—approved the shipment of at least one ton of nearly pure cocaine to Miami International Airport as a way of gathering information about the Colombian drug cartels. But the cocaine ended up on the street because of "poor judgment and management on the part of several CIA officers," the intelligence agency said.&lt;ref name="DMN1996-11-26"&gt;{{citation

===Southeast Asia===

Alfred McCoy, author of [[The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia]], described CIA complicity in the Vietnam-era drug trade originating in Southeast Asia, and further described CIA attempts to interfere with publication of the book.

&lt;blockquote&gt;On June 1 of this year an official of the US Central Intelligence Agency paid a visit to the New York offices of my publisher, Harper and Row, Inc. This CIA official was Mr. Cord Meyer, Jr. (now the CIA's Assistant Deputy Director of Plans; formerly the CIA official in charge of providing covert financial subsidies for organizations such as the National Student Association, Encounter Magazine, and the Congress for Cultural Freedom). Mr. Meyer urged several of his old friends among Harper and Row's senior management to provide him with a copy of the galley proofs of my history of the international narcotics traffic, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia. In this book I show the complicity of various US agencies—particularly the CIA and the State Department—in organizing the Southeast Asian drug traffic since the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="McCoy1972-09-21"&gt;{{citation
 | journal = New York Review of Books
 | volume = 19
 | issue = 4 
 | date = 21 September 1972
 | title = A Correspondence with the CIA
 | first = Alfred W. | last = McCoy
 | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1972/09/21/a-correspondence-with-the-cia/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Dr. McCoy, the agency intimidated his sources and tried to keep the book from being published.&lt;ref name="McCoy1972-09-21"/&gt; There is also an article in Peace Magazine containing similar allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.peacemagazine.org/v04n3p10.htm "The Secret Team, Part IV: Visiting Vietnam", John Bacher, Peace Magazine Jun-Jul 1988, page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mel Gibson]] film, ''[[Air America (film)|Air America]]''. ''Air America'' was based on the Christopher Robbins book ''Air America'', which chronicled the history of CIA proprietary airlines in Southeast Asia.

In his book, McCoy wrote

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is transported in the planes, vehicles, and other conveyances supplied by the United States. The profit from the trade has been going into the pockets of some of our best friends in Southeast Asia. The charge concludes with the statement that the traffic is being carried on with the indifference if not the closed-eye compliance of some American officials and there is no likelihood of its being shut down in the foreseeable future."&lt;ref name="LearyLaos" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is not inconsistent with Leary's description ([[CIA activities in Asia and the Pacific#CIA operations in Laos, proprietary airlines, and the drug trade|with respect to Laos and Southeast Asia]]), although there seem to be differences in the degree of knowledge and consent by CIA management.

====Beginning of transnational drug trade in colonial Indochina====
McCoy asserts that the French administration of Indochina had financed its covert operations with the drug trade, and the CIA had simply replaced the French, to finance similar operations.&lt;ref name="McCoy1991-11-09"&gt;{{citation
 | title = Interview with Alfred McCoy
 | date = 9 November 1991
 | first= Paul | last = DeRienzo
 | url = http://www.bearcave.com/bookrev/nugan_hand.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he had gone to Paris and interviewed retired general [[Maurice Belleux]], the former head of the French equivalent of the CIA, an organization called [[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage]] (SDECE, predecessor of the current French service, the [[Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure]]).

&lt;blockquote&gt;In an amazing interview he told me that French military intelligence had financed all their covert operations from the control of the Indochina drug trade ... The French paratroopers fighting with hill tribes collected the opium and French aircraft would fly the opium down to Saigon and the Sino-Vietnamese mafia that was the instrument of French intelligence would then distribute the opium. The central bank accounts, the sharing of the profits, was all controlled by French military intelligence. He concluded the interview by telling me that it was his information that the CIA had taken over the French assets and were pursuing something of the same policy. So I went to Southeast Asia to follow up on that lead and that's what took me into doing this whole book. It was basically pulling a thread and keep tucking at it and a veil masking the reality began to unravel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Since the 1920s the League of Nations, the forerunner of the United Nations, and the United States have prohibited opium and cocaine products from legal sale. These products had already emerged as vast global commodities with very substantial production zones and large markets, large demand for those commodities both in the third world and the first. The historic Asia opium zone stretches across 5,000 miles of Asian mainland from Turkey to Laos along the southern borders of the Soviet Union and the southern border of communist China. It just so happened that one of the key war zones in the cold war happened to lay astride the Asian opium zone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Perspective on CIA role====
&lt;blockquote&gt; During the 40 years of the cold war, from the late 1940s to this year, the CIA pursued a policy that I call ''radical pragmatism''. Their mission was to stop communism and in pursuit of that mission they would ally with anyone and do anything to fight communism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McCoy does not so much accuse the CIA of direct participation in the drug trade, than protecting the drug trade of people the CIA believed essential allies in its primary mission.

&lt;blockquote&gt; During the long years of the cold war the CIA mounted major covert guerilla operations along the Soviet-Chinese border. The CIA recruited as allies people we now call drug lords for their operation against communist China in northeastern Burma in 1950, then from 1965 to 1975 [during the Vietnam war] their operation in northern Laos and throughout the decade of the 1980s, the Afghan operation against Soviet forces in Afghanistan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Powerful, upland political figures control the societies and economies in these regions and part of that panoply of power is the opium trade. The CIA extended the mantle of their alliance to these drug lords and in every case the drug lords used it to expand a small local trade in opium into a major source of supply for the world markets and the United States.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While they were allied with the United States these drug lords were absolutely immune to any kind of investigation. If you're involved in any kind of illicit commodity trade, organized crime activity like drug trafficking, there is only one requisite for success, immunity, and the CIA gave them that. As long as they were allied with the CIA, the local police and then the DEA stayed away from the drug lords.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

UNODOC observes

&lt;blockquote&gt;Southeast Asia is closing a tragic chapter that has blighted the Golden Triangle for decades—the region is now almost opium free. Yet it is not free of poverty and therefore farmers remain vulnerable to the temptations of illicit incomes. Much more assistance—for alternative crops and also for viable income substitution—is needed to ensure that drug-free development is sustained in the greater Mekong basin.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It may well be that US aid, perhaps not from the CIA but from the [[Agency for International Development]], will be needed create these alternatives. This level of strategy is the responsibility of the [[United States Department of State]].

According to [[William M. Leary]], a University of Georgia historian who analyzed Laotian operations in a study backed by the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence, CIA-led covert action in Laos was the largest paramilitary operation in the history of the Agency. Although a large body of evidence exists claiming that the CIA was knowingly complicit in opium smuggling operations, Leary takes a position which claims that the CIA, which funded his work, was not complicit in the drug trade.

{{quote|For more than 13 years, the Agency directed native forces that fought major North Vietnamese units to a standstill. As Joseph Westermeyer, who spent the years 1965 to 1975 in Laos as a physician, public health worker, and researcher, wrote in ''Poppies, Pipes, and People'': "American-owned airlines never knowingly transported opium in or out of Laos, nor did their American pilots ever profit from its transport. Yet every plane in Laos undoubtedly carried opium at some time, unknown to the pilot and his superiors--just as had virtually every pedicab, every Mekong River sampan, and every missionary jeep between China and the Gulf of Siam.

If the CIA was not involved in the drug trade, it did know about it. As former DCI William Colby acknowledged, the Agency did little about it during the 1960s, but later took action against the traders as drugs became a problem among American troops in Vietnam. The CIA's main focus in Laos remained on fighting the war, not on policing the drug trade.&lt;ref name="LearyLaos"&gt;{{citation

===Southwest Asia===
{{Original research section|date=November 2015}}
{{see also|Opium production in Afghanistan}}

While the CIA reports on the flow of opium, and its derivative, [[heroin]], in Southwest Asia, US government researchers also observe that the indirect effects of the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], as well as the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]], have increased the flow."Afghanistan and Pakistan produced an estimated 41 percent of the world's opium in 1998. Europe remains the primary market for Southwest Asian heroin, but the drug is also consumed in Africa, the United States, and Canada."&lt;ref name="CIA-HeroinMvt-2007" /&gt; [[Image:CIA-SWAsia-Heroin-2007.png|thumb|CIA map of major heroin flows from Southwest Asia]]
According to the CIA flow study,
:*Most Southwest Asian heroin flows overland through Iran and Turkey to Europe via the Balkans. Although regional conflicts have forced traffickers to modify delivery routes, the Balkans remain the primary passageway for Southwest Asian heroin bound for Western Europe. Heroin and opium shipments are smuggled from Turkey in bonded trucks, buses, or personal vehicles to Western Europe for distribution.
:*An undetermined amount of Southwest Asian heroin flows directly from Pakistan to overseas markets concealed in maritime containers, or carried by couriers on commercial air flights to the Middle East, Europe, Africa, the US, and Canada.
:*The Central Asian states, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Kyrgyzstan]]  have emerged as important smuggling routes for Southwest Asian heroin moving to or through Russia and Eastern Europe. Loose border controls,  lack of regional counternarcotics resources, and a growing Russian heroin market facilitate the movement of drugs through Central Asia by vehicle, train, and commercial air means.

LTC John Glaze, USAF, Deputy Commander of the 353rd Special Operations Group at Kadena Air Base, Japan, writing for the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Opium production in Afghanistan has skyrocketed since the U.S. military teamed with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Afghanistan's Northern Alliance in toppling the Taliban in 2001 ... This growing opium trade is threatening to destabilize the Afghan government and turn the conflict-ridden country back into a safe haven for drug traffickers and terrorists.&lt;ref name="Glaze-2007-10"&gt;{{citation

He quotes Afghan [[President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] as saying "Either Afghanistan destroys opium or opium will destroy Afghanistan." Glaze does not suggest that the CIA takes an active role in the ongoing drug trade, but sees the CIA as having influenced the current Afghan economic, governance, and security situations, which encourage the growth of opium and heroin production.

According to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;The magnitude and importance of Afghanistan's opium economy are virtually unprecedented and unique in global experience—it has been roughly estimated as equivalent to 36% of licit (i.e. non-drug) GDP in 2004/05, or if drugs are also included in the denominator, 27% of total drug-inclusive GDP&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01"&gt;{{citation

Karzai, on the Ministry of Counternarcotics webpage in 2006, said "Our goal is to secure a sustainable decrease in poppy cultivation, drug production, consumption of illicit drugs, and trafficking with a view to complete and sustain elimination.  As a result, it will pave the way for a pro-poor, private sector-led economic growth."&lt;ref name="KarzaiCN2006"&gt;{{citation

====Background of the current situation====
{{Original research section|date=November 2015}}
It was alleged by the Soviets on multiple occasions that American CIA agents were helping smuggle opium out of [[Afghanistan]], either into the West, in order to raise money for the [[Afghan resistance]] or into the [[Soviet Union]] in order to weaken it through drug addiction.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} According to [[Alfred W. McCoy|Alfred McCoy]], the CIA supported various Afghan drug lords, for instance [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].&lt;ref name="McCoy1991-11-09"/&gt;

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], a combination of U.S. CIA and military forces (US and allied powers), in support of the [[Northern Alliance]], quickly regained control of Afghanistan from the [[Taliban]], leaving the country "in economic ruin and political chaos. In December 2001, a number of prominent Afghans met in Bonn, Germany, under [[United Nations]] (UN) auspices to develop a plan to reestablish the State of Afghanistan, including provisions for a new constitution and national elections. As part of that agreement, the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) was designated the lead country in addressing [[illegal drug trade|counter-narcotics]] issues in Afghanistan. Afghanistan subsequently implemented its new constitution and held national elections. On December 7, 2004, Hamid Karzai was formally sworn in as president of a democratic Afghanistan."&lt;ref name="Glaze-2007-10" /&gt;

Approximately 40,000 foreign troops help manage security in Afghanistan, principally of 32,000 regular soldiers from 37 [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) forces: the [[International Security Assistance Force]]. 8,000 US and other special operations forces make up the balance. To manage this turmoil, over 40,000 foreign troops still occupy Afghanistan. There is significant resistance, both from the ideological/theocratic [[Taliban]], especially in southern Afghanistan, and also independent local warlords and drug organizations. [[Antonio Maria Costa]], Executive Director of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC), described the situation this way: "There is no rule of law in most of the southern parts of Afghanistan—the bullets rule."

It is helpful to be aware of certain areas of Afghanistan, which play a role in the drug traffic.
:*"Southern region" of [[Helmand]] and [[Kandahar]] provinces, on the border with [[Pakistan]], which are the highest-volume areas for drug transactions. There is a traditional route from Helmand, through Pakistan, to Iran
:*[[Herat]], in Herat Province, the Northern Alliance stronghold, which borders [[Iran]]
:*[[Faizabad]], in [[Badakhshan]] province, which has  borders with [[Tajikistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[China]].

====The Afghan economy and opium====
{{Original research section|date=November 2015}}
The 2004 [[United Nations Development Programme]] ranked Afghanistan number 173 of 177 countries, using a human development index, with Afghanistan near or at the bottom of virtually every development indicator including nutrition, infant mortality, life expectancy, and literacy. Several factors encourage opium production, the greatest being economic: the high rate of return on investment from opium poppy cultivation has driven an agricultural shift in Afghanistan from growing traditional crops to growing opium poppy. Much of the funds involved do not go through traditional banks, but rather the ''[[hawala]]'' system, which makes tracking by the CIA much more difficult, although not impossible. See [[#The nexus between the drug industry and hawala|the role of ''hawala'' and Afghan drugs]], and also the [[FININT]] section of [[CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities]].

It must be emphasized that opium cultivation, on this scale, is not traditional.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the fact that only 12 percent of its land is arable, agriculture is a way of life for 70 percent of Afghans and is the country's primary source of income. During good years, Afghanistan produced enough food to feed its people as well as supply a surplus for export. Its traditional agricultural products include wheat, corn, barley, rice, cotton, fruit, nuts, and grapes. However, its agricultural economy has suffered considerably ... Afghanistan's largest and fastest cash crop is opium.&lt;ref name="Glaze-2007-10" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Afghanistan's rugged terrain encourages local autonomy, which, in some cases, means local leadership committed to an opium economy. The terrain makes surveillance and enforcement difficult.

{{quote|Afghanistan's economy has thus evolved to the point where it is now highly dependent on opium. Although less than 4 percent of arable land in Afghanistan was used for opium poppy cultivation in 2006, revenue from the harvest brought in over $3 billion—more than 35 percent of the country's total gross national product (GNP).  According to Antonio Costa, "Opium poppy cultivation, processing, and transport have become Afghanistan's top employers, its main source of capital, and the principal base of its economy."  Today, a record 2.9 million Afghanis from 28 of 34 provinces are involved in opium cultivation in some way, which represents nearly 10 percent of the population.  Although Afghanistan's overall economy is being boosted by opium profits, less than 20 percent of the $3 billion in opium profits actually goes to impoverished farmers, while more than 80 percent goes into the pockets of Afghan's opium traffickers and kingpins and their political connections.  Even heftier profits are generated outside of Afghanistan by international drug traffickers and dealers.

Traditionally, processing of Afghan's opium into heroin has taken place outside of Afghanistan; however, in an effort to reap more profits internally, Afghan drug kingpins have stepped up heroin processing within their borders. Heroin processing labs have proliferated in Afghanistan since the late 1990s, particularly in the unstable southern region, further complicating stabilization efforts. With the reemergence of the Taliban and the virtual absence of the rule of law in the countryside, opium production and heroin processing have dramatically increased, especially in the southern province of Helmand.&lt;ref name="Glaze-2007-10" /&gt;}}

According to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) ''2007 Afghanistan Opium Survey'',  Afghanistan produced approximately 8,200 metric tonnes of opium — nearly double the estimate of global annual consumption.&lt;ref name="CSDP"&gt;{{citation 
 | title = Afghanistan Update: Heroin Production On The Rise Again In Afghanistan
 | date = 19 November 2007
 | publisher = Common Sense for Drug Policy
 | url = http://www.csdp.org/news/news/afghanistan.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 25, 2007 op-ed in ''The Washington Post'', [[Antonio Maria Costa]], Executive Director of UNODC, asked "Does opium defy the laws of economics? Historically, no. In 2001, prices surged tenfold from 2000, to a record high, after the Taliban all but eliminated opium poppy cultivation across the Afghan territory under its control. So why, with last year's bumper crop, is the opposite not occurring? Early estimates suggest that opium cultivation is likely to increase again this year. That should be an added incentive to sell.

He speculated,

{{quote|So where is it? I fear there may be a more sinister explanation for why the bottom has not fallen out of the opium market: Major traffickers are withholding significant amounts.

Drug traffickers have a symbiotic relationship with insurgents and terrorist groups such as the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Instability makes opium cultivation possible; opium buys protection and pays for weapons and foot soldiers, and these in turn create an environment in which drug lords, insurgents and terrorists can operate with impunity.

Opium is the glue that holds this murky relationship together. If profits fall, these sinister forces have the most to lose. I suspect that the big traffickers are hoarding surplus opium as a hedge against future price shocks and as a source of funding for future terrorist attacks, in Afghanistan or elsewhere.&lt;ref name="WaPo2007-04-25"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As of October, 2009, the Taliban are supporting the opium trade and deriving funding from it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/world/asia/19taliban.html?_r=1&amp;hp "", by Eric Schmitt, October 18, 2009, [[The New York Times]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corruption and the erosion of the rule of law====
{{Original research section|date=November 2015}}

{{quote|Corruption associated with the opium economy has spread to all levels of the Afghan government from the police to the parliament, and is eroding the rule of law. Farmers routinely bribe police and counternarcotics eradication personnel to turn a blind eye. Law enforcement personnel are also paid off by drug traffickers to ignore or, in some cases, protect their movements. Afghan government officials are now believed to be involved in at least 70 percent of opium trafficking, and experts estimate that at least 13 former or present provincial governors are directly involved in the drug trade ... In some cases ... [local leaders] are the same individuals who cooperated with the United States in ousting the Taliban in 2001.&lt;ref name="Glaze-2007-10" /&gt;}}

Again, that ''[[hawala]]'' handles and launders much of the funds involved make enforcement even more difficult.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Working with the UK and the Afghan government, the United States developed its own strategy to counter the opium problem in Afghanistan, which has the following five pillars: 
:#alternative livelihoods
:#elimination and eradication
:#interdiction
:#law enforcement and justice reform
:#public information&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Department of State (DoS), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Justice (DoJ) are the primary organizations involved in carrying out this counternarcotics strategy for the US. The role of the CIA has not been mentioned, although the CIA is involved in preparing lists of terrorism suspects for the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]. UNODC's executive director believes these measures are insufficient: "What can be done? Since NATO forces are wary of making enemies out of opium farmers by being associated with eradication, and since the Afghan government is opposed to spraying poppy fields, rounding up the major traffickers may be the best available option for disrupting Afghanistan's lucrative opium market."

Both demand and supply reduction are important. "the consuming countries need to get serious about curbing drug addiction. If there was less demand for heroin, the bottom really would fall out of the opium market." Farmers economically dependent on opium must have viable alternatives that give sustainable income.  On the supply side, identifying the most-wanted traffickers and subjecting them to international arrest warrants with extradition, asset seizure, and travel bans could help. While it is not easy to destroy opium storage and heroin production laboratories, it is far easier to destroy drugs at the source than in transit.&lt;ref name="WaPo2007-04-25" /&gt;

"Afghanistan's neighbors are either accomplices or victims in the opium trade, so they need to be part of the solution. They could, for example, improve intelligence-sharing and border security to ensure that more opium is seized. At the moment, less than a quarter of the world's opium is intercepted, compared with around half of global cocaine output."&lt;ref name="WaPo2007-04-25" /&gt; This complicates, of course, the complex US relations with Pakistan and Iran.

====The nexus between the drug industry and ''hawala''====
{{Original research section|date=November 2015}}
There is an important nexus between drugs and ''[[hawala]]'' (informal money transfer system) in Afghanistan. The UN analysis  is based on interviews with a sample of 54 ''hawala'' brokers in the main centers of ''hawala'' activity of Afghanistan as well as during a visit to Peshawar, Pakistan. In addition, interviews were conducted with users of the hawala system (drug dealers, businessmen, traders, international aid workers), regulators (government officials, central bank personnel), and formal
service providers (bankers, accountants). In addition to ''hawala'', they found protection payments and connections, by which the drug industry has major linkages with local administration as well as high levels of the national government.&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01" /&gt;

See [[Clandestine HUMINT#Informal value transfer systems|informal money transfer systems]] to support clandestine activity, including terrorism, drug trade, and intelligence collection. See the section of the article, [[CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities#FININT|CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities]] on how the intelligence community and the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] attempt to control ''hawala'' used to finance terrorism.

Different localities studied by the UNODC give different views of the [[money laundering|laundering]] of drug funds. It is difficult to get a solid sense of the overall economy. In [[Faizabad]], for example, indicated that during certain times of the year close to 100% of the liquidity of the hawala system in the province is derived from drugs, whereas in [[Herat]], the  [[Northern Alliance]] stronghold, it was estimated that only 30% of the ''hawala'' market's overall transaction volume is directly linked to drugs. Analysis of data gathered in places like Herat was complicated by confirmed links between drug money and legitimate imports. The southern region (Helmand and Kandahar provinces) is also a key centre for money laundering in Afghanistan (about 60% of the funds are drug related and 80-90% of the hawala dealers in Kandahar [the former Taliban stronghold] and Helmand are involved in money transfers related to narcotics).&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01" /&gt;

Helmand has emerged as a key facilitator of the opium trade, both between provinces and exports, while overall estimates of the local hawala markets' drug-related component are of a similar order of magnitude to those in Kandahar. This finding
adds weight to the notion that the major trading centers in these two neighboring provinces should be treated as essentially one market. Bearing this in mind, the study calculated that Helmand could account for roughly US$800 million of Afghanistan's drug-related hawala business and that Herat is the second largest contributor, with in the range of US$
300-500 million of drug money laundered annually.

Furthermore, [[Dubai]] appears to be a central clearing house for international hawala activities. In addition, various cities in Pakistan, notably [[Peshawar]], [[Quetta]], and [[Karachi]], are major transaction centers. It appears that even in the case of drug shipments to Iran, payments for them come into Afghanistan from Pakistan ... the hawala system has been key to the deepening and widening of the "informal economy" in Afghanistan, where there is anonymity and the opportunity to launder money.&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01" /&gt;

Hawala, however, also contributes positively to the regional economy. It has been central to the survival of Afghanistan's financial system through war.&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01" /&gt; According to  Maimbo (2003), "integral to processes of early developmentand vital for the continued delivery of funds to the provinces."&lt;ref name="Maimbo2003"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"The hawala system also plays an important role in currency exchange. It participates in the Central Bank's regular foreign currency auctions, and was instrumental in the successful introduction of a new currency for Afghanistan in 2002-2003."&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch01" /&gt;

====Possible effects on Iran====
{{Original research section|date=November 2015}}
There are claims and counterclaims that the US may  have used groups involved in drug smuggling in an effort to destabilize Iran. Hard evidence is lacking. The group, "Jundullah", is made up of ethnic Baluchis, and is in the  Baluchistan region of Pakistan, bordering Iran.  It has taken responsibility for the deaths and kidnappings of more than a dozen Iranian soldiers and officials. Again, there is no hard evidence. The situation also may reflect a conflict between the U.S. military and the [[Vice-President]] [[Dick Cheney]], in that the military believes &lt;ref name="Porter2007-06-21"&gt;{{citation
 | date = 21 June 2007 
 | journal = Inter Press Service
 | title = US-Iran: New Arms Claim Reveals Cheney-Military Rift
 | first = Gareth | last = Porter
 | url = http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/06/21/2019/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the weapons may be purchased through the drug trade, but Cheney believes they are being supplied by the government of Iran.

The Inter Press Service report quoted [[United States]] [[Undersecretary]] [[United States Department of State|of State]] [[R. Nicholas Burns|Nicholas Burns]] as saying, on June 12, 2007, that Iran was "transferring arms to the Taliban in Afghanistan", putting it in the context of a larger alleged Iranian role of funding "extremists" in the Palestinian territories, Lebanon and Iraq. "The following day he asserted that there was "irrefutable evidence" of such Iranian arms supply to the Taliban." The reporter mentioned that Cheney had used the same phrase "irrefutable evidence" on Sep. 20, 2002, in referring to the administration's accusation that Saddam Hussein had a programme to enrich uranium as the basis for a nuclear weapon. It is the reporter's theory that the recurrence of the phrase meant the statement could have been crafted by Cheney, but it also could be a coincidental use of a phrase that has been used in other official announcements.

The Jundallah group is made up Baluchi tribesmen, often operating out of Pakistan, but the Baluchi have a [[Balochistan (Pakistan)#Social issues|complex relationship]] with Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan. While news sources agree that the US government has not made a Presidential Finding that covert action is needed, nor reported such action to the eight senior members of Congress who oversee the most sensitive operations, the argument is made that CIA subsidies go to Pakistan, which, in turn, funds the group. If Pakistan does all the funding, the letter of the law would be followed, in that the US is not subsidizing the group.

It is possible that, as in Southeast Asia, the activities of a group are not directly funded, but are funded by allowing them to operate in the drug trade. [[General]] [[Dan McNeill]], the NATO commander in Afgahanistan,  pointed to the "U.S. command's knowledge of the link between the heroin trade and trafficking in arms between southeastern Iran and southern Afghanistan. The main entry point for opium and heroin smuggling between Afghanistan and Iran runs through the Iranian province of Sistan-Baluchistan to the capital of Zahedan. The two convoys of arms which were intercepted by NATO forces last spring had evidently come through that Iranian province." &lt;ref name="Porter2007-06-21" /&gt;

According to a report by Robert Tait of The Guardian Feb. 17, Sistan-Baluchistan province has also been the setting for frequent violent incidents involving militant Sunni groups and drug traffickers. Tait reported that more than 3,000 Iranian security personnel had been killed in armed clashes with drug traffickers since the 1979 Islamic revolution.&lt;ref name="Porter2007-06-21" /&gt;

CIA representatives denied involvement to ABC News, saying "the account of alleged CIA action is false" and reiterated that the U.S. provides no funding of the Jundullah group, and no hard evidence of US involvement. Pakistani government sources say the secret campaign against Iran by Jundullah was on the agenda when Vice President Dick Cheney met with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in February.

While Herat is not the highest-volume area of opium trade, Herat, and the other Iranian border areas of Farah, and Nimroz, have some of the highest prices, presumably due to demand from the Iranian market.&lt;ref name="UNODC-Afg-Drug-Ch05"&gt;{{citation

"The UNODC estimates 60 percent of Afghanistan's opium is trafficked across Iran's border (much of it in transit to Europe). Seizures of the narcotic by Iranian authorities in the first half of this year are up 29 percent from the same period last year, according to the country's police chief, as reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) ...

Beehner said "Tehran also has spent millions of dollars and deployed thousands of troops to secure its porous 1,000-mile border with Afghanistan and Pakistan ... a few hundred Iranian drug police die each year in battles with smugglers. Referring to the head of the UNODC office in Iran, Roberto Arbitrio, Beehner quoted Arbitrio in an interview with ''[[The Times]].'' "You have drug groups like guerrilla forces, [who] ... shoot with rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, and Kalashnikovs."

A second-phase strategy came under President [[Mohammad Khatami]], focused more on prevention and treatment.&lt;ref name="CFR2006-09-14" /&gt; Drug traffic is considered a security problem, and much of it is associated with [[Baloch people|Baluchi]] tribesmen, who recognize traditional tribal rather than national borders.&lt;ref name="NYT2001-08-18"&gt;{{citation

Iranian drug strategy changed again under President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], who took office in 2005. Iran's drug policy has been reconsidered and shifted back toward supply interdiction and boosting border security.&lt;ref name="Samii2003" /&gt; It is unclear if this is connected to more wide-ranging concerns with border security, perhaps in relation to [[CIA Activities by Region: Near East, North Africa, South and Southwest Asia#Baluchi guerillas in Iran (Iran, April 2007)|Baluchi guerillas in Iran]]

A CIA analyst in an independent research program characterized the agency's understanding of the problem.

&lt;blockquote&gt; Trafficking of women and children for the sex industry and for labor is prevalent in all regions of the United States. An estimated 45,000 to 50,000 women and children are trafficked annually to the United States, primarily by small crime rings and loosely connected criminal networks. The trafficked victims have traditionally come from Southeast Asia and Latin America; however, increasingly they are coming from the New Independent States and Central and Eastern Europe. Trafficking to the US is likely to increase given weak economies and few job opportunities in the countries of origin; low risk of prosecution and enormous profit potential for the traffickers; and improved international transportation infrastructures. Though it may be impossible to eradicate trafficking to the US, it is possible to diminish the problem significantly by targeted prevention and [[microcredit]] strategies in the source countries; strengthening the penalties and laws against traffickers in this country; and enhancing assistance and protections for the victims.&lt;ref name="Richard1999"&gt;{{Citation

CIA provided analytic support to the Department of State on human smuggling and trafficking, with an expert who oversaw the assessment, drafting, and coordination of the 2002 Trafficking in Persons report.  As part of intergovernmental work, it collected and reported intelligence to US law enforcement agencies conducting operations against members of Latin American and Middle Eastern terrorist groups and against smugglers of aliens into the United States.&lt;ref name="CIAvsCrime"&gt;{{citation

==Financial crime and money laundering==
CIA works with the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FINCen). With respect to efforts to apply the Patriot Act to a foreign bank involved in money laundering.  CIA analysts identified key players in the bank, their relationship to international organized crime, and the bank's efforts to hide its accounts from US law enforcement.&lt;ref name="CIAvsCrime" /&gt; See [[Financial intelligence]] (FININT).

The '''Canterbury District Health Board''' (Canterbury DHB) is a [[district health board]] with the focus on providing healthcare to the entire Canterbury Regional area, located within the [[South Island]] of New Zealand. It is responsible for roughly 510,000 residents; or 12% of New Zealand's population. The Canterbury District Health Board covers a territory of 26,881 square kilometers and is divided between six territorial local authorities.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdhb.health.nz/About-CDHB/Pages/Our-Region.aspx |title=Our Region |publisher=www.cdhb.health.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In July 2005, ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' reported that the Canterbury District Health Board and [[Spark New Zealand|Telecom NZ]] had signed a three-year telecommunications deal. The deal gave Telecom NZ the responsibility for providing all health board telecommunications. There was also a two-year right of renewal clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canterbury DHB inks Telecom deal|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/canterbury-dhb/news/article.cfm?o_id=337&amp;objectid=10334178|accessdate=3 January 2017|agency=New Zealand Herald|date=4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
It has been regarded as a successful [[accountable care system]] which has moderated the rate of growth in hospital use by investing in services in the community. GPs and consultants agreed health pathways for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with common medical conditions thereby breaking down barriers between clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Accountable care organisations (ACOs) explained|url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/topics/integrated-care/accountable-care-organisations-explained|accessdate=13 July 2017|publisher=Kings Fund|date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2001, after multiple union contracts fell through, more than 1100 staff members of the [[Princess Margaret Hospital (Christchurch)|Princess Margaret Hospital]] went on strike to protest the uncertainty regarding their jobs at the hospital. However, the scope of the full strike was roughly 3000 people from hospitals throughout the region.&lt;ref name="2001 Protests"&gt;{{cite news|title=3000 Canterbury hospital staff to strike|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=228623|accessdate=3 January 2017|agency=New Zealand Herald|date=16 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, the health board was accused of "virtually sweat shop conditions" by the National Union of Public Employees. The board denied all accusations against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Sweat shop' worker conditions, says union|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/canterbury-dhb/news/article.cfm?o_id=337&amp;objectid=10344062|accessdate=3 January 2017|agency=New Zealand Herald|date=5 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the accusations, roughly 500 personnel from the district started a five day strike for a 30% pay rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Health workers begin five day strike|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/canterbury-dhb/news/article.cfm?o_id=337&amp;objectid=10345170|accessdate=3 January 2017|agency=New Zealand Herald|date=12 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, approximately 3974 appointments were postponed due to a payment dispute with the Regional District Health Boards, including Canterbury, and members of the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists. It was estimated that the resident medical officers had forfeited roughly $1.1 million in lost wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Martin|title=Doctors' strike delayed thousands of health care appointments|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11769008|accessdate=3 January 2017|agency=New Zealand Herald|date=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early history, [[Mexico]] was occupied by multiple indigenous tribes such as the [[Mayans]] and [[Aztecs]]. In the 16th century, [[Spain]] colonized [[Nueva Espana]] and took over the land from the indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Priestley|first1=Ingram|title=The Mexican nation: a history|date=1935|publisher=The Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is now an independent nation, Mexico retains much of the cultural influence of Spain, including its official religion of [[Catholicism]], the [[Spanish language]], and the importance of [[machismo]]- the belief that men are superior to women.&lt;ref name="culturalsensitivity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: A Practical  Guide for Tuberculosis Programs That Provide Services to Persons from Mexico.|publisher=Center for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico also retains much of the traditional beliefs of the indigenous people who first occupied the country. Besides Spanish, there are over one hundred different languages spoken in the country today. As a result, the current medical system involves a mix of traditional and Western medicinal techniques.&lt;ref name="culturalsensitivity" /&gt;

Traditional beliefs such as [[Susto]], also known as fear of illness, is thought to occur when the soul leaves the body and wanders. It is believed that women experience this more often than men. Empacho, or the dislocation of body functions is often associated with morning sickness in pregnancy because it is believed that the baby is bringing increased energy to the digestive process. [[Evil eye|Mal de Ojo]] is another important perceived cause of illness which relates to birth. It is believed that if someone is looked upon with admiration or jealousy that they will become ill themselves.&lt;ref name="culturalsensitivity" /&gt;

Today in Mexico, 24% of families live in poverty, nearly 40% of the population is uninsured, and the average life expectancy  is 77.3 years. 95% of the population is literate. Mexico has a low infant mortality rate (7 per 1,000 births) and maternal mortality rate (43.2 per 100,000 births), which are low in comparison to other countries with a similar economic status. Mexico's contraceptive use rate of 72.9% is high compared to similar countries.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pregnancy==
Mexico contains a variety of indigenous groups, cultural influences, and socioeconomic situations which all affect health outcomes. The machismo culture definitely influences pregnancy and the perception of women. However, amongst all groups pregnancy is welcome. It was found in [[2012]] that only 12% of births were unwanted, compared to a much higher global average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico's midwives enter the mainstream|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is little information on the sexual education received by women from different socioeconomic classes and geographic regions, which may influence pregnancy behaviors and beliefs. Traditional culture believes that pregnancy is a sacred event. This belief carries over into the post-Colombian Catholic culture that is very prevalent in Mexico today. The traditional birth culture is shaped by the beliefs of a hot-cold balance within the body.&lt;ref name="MMInterview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bortin|first1=Sylvia|title=Interviews with Mexican Midwives|journal=Journal of Nurse-Midwifery|date=1993|volume=38|issue=3|pages=170–177|doi=10.1016/0091-2182(93)90043-g}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoSS"&gt;{{cite web|title="Mexican Americans."|url=http://www.css.edu/academics/centers-and-institutes/center-for-healthcare-innovation/help-place/resources/cultural-aspects-of-healthcare/mexican-americans.htm|website=Mexican Americans|publisher=The College of St. Scholastica}}&lt;/ref&gt; This balance must be maintained throughout the pregnancy and delivery process. To ensure the balance, women will avoid “hot” foods during their pregnancy, as the [[gestation]] is considered a “hot” event. Furthermore, women attempting to become pregnant are advised to avoid cold surfaces, like medical examination tables, as they are thought to promote sterility or infertility.&lt;ref name="CoSS" /&gt;

A main differentiator of pregnancy behaviors is socioeconomic status. This will influence a woman’s outlook on pregnancy, her level of care received during pregnancy and the lifestyle changes that she makes during this time. Women are encouraged to avoid strenuous work during pregnancy, and some are encouraged to leave work altogether in order to ensure a healthy pregnancy and birth.&lt;ref name="CoSS" /&gt; During pregnancy a majority of women will receive some form of prenatal care. [[World Data Bank]]’s most recent statistic for Mexican prenatal care stated that 98% of women were seeking some prenatal care (2012). While a vast majority of women are receiving care, this is often not consistent and varies across socioeconomic class. Women of a higher socioeconomic class are more likely to seek care from a GP than their counterparts.&lt;ref name="trad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camey|first1=X.C.|last2=Barrios|first2=C.G.|last3=Guerrero|first3=X.R.|last4=Nunez-Urquiza|first4=R.M.|last5=Hernandez|first5=D.G.|last6=Glass|first6=A.L.|title=Traditional birth attendants in Mexico: Advantages and inadequacies  of care for normal deliveries.|journal=Social Science and Medicine|date=1996|volume=43|issue=2|pages=199–207|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(95)00362-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, women have been more likely to seek prenatal care later in their pregnancy, with many women not obtaining such care until the second [[wikt:trimester|trimester]].&lt;ref name="MMInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PiHW"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poma|first1=Pedro|title=Pregnancy in Hispanic Women|journal=Journal of the National Medical Association|date=1987|volume=79|issue=9|pages=929–935}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Data that breaks down incidence of modern prenatal care needs to be collected.
 
Besides maintaining the hot-cold balance and avoiding work, there are other lifestyle changes that a woman may take on during her pregnancy. Women are encouraged to walk frequently throughout their pregnancies and often take to their mothers or grandmothers for comfort or advice. Strong familial support is tied to improved pregnancy outcomes as the family is traditionally very supportive of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name="PiHW" /&gt;

== Labor ==
Access to care is restricted in many ways, and to such an extent that certain members of the population have access to forms of care and choices that others do not. There are private healthcare institutions available for those who can afford them, and large public health institutions which can provide care without costs to those eligible to be enrolled in their programs. In 1987 more than 80% of births in Mexico took place under the care of traditional midwives and empirical midwives.&lt;ref name="MMInterview" /&gt;
 
There are two fundamental concepts in the traditional medicine practiced in Mexico; hot-cold duality and naturaleza (inherent nature):
* ''Hot-cold duality''— all illnesses, physical conditions, drinks, foods are either hot or cold. Pregnancy is considered a hot condition, where upon birth women lose heat and are at risk of becoming dangerously cold.
* ''Naturaleza''— encompasses all the characteristics and qualities that physically and spiritually comprise an individual. One can have a strong or weak nature, this is determined by the phases of the mother, and the nature of the parents. This nature can in turn, influence sexuality, family size, and a person’s physical spiritual and temperamental characteristics. By extension, these things can affect one’s pregnancy and birthing process (onset and length)

Traditional midwives sometimes use hydrotherapy, there are two basic types described in the literature:

* ''Temazcal (sweat bath)''— used prenatally, postpartum, and sometimes during the intrapartum period. The bath uses herbs that have bacteriostatic, anti inflammatory and other therapeutic qualities  
* ''Vapor (steam bath)''— also uses herbal infusions with the addition of essential oils. Laboring person will sit on a chair that is on top of a larger streaming container.

Traditionalist midwives may sometimes also incorporate some of the following to help ease the process of labor:

* Medicinal plants and animal substances, not just orally, but through external application like massage and poultices, as well as douching. 
* [[Sobada]] (therapeutic touch/massage); can be done prenatally to change position of fetus (can prevent problems with abnormal presentation), aid prolonged labor, and difficulty delivering placenta.  
* May invoke protector spirits ([[Virgin Mary]] or saints). They pray and call to these spirits to find reassurance and deal with the uncertainties surrounding pregnancy, birth, and puerperium (6 week period after childbirth where reproductive organs return to their original nonpregnant condition). 
* Use of oxytocic injections and administration of intravenous fluids to speed labor has become more widespread, even with traditional midwives. 
* It is believed that things like brujeria, mal aire, and susto can affect birth outcomes and the labor process. Sometimes red ribbon and clothes can be worn or used to prevent el mal de ojo.&lt;ref name="PiHW" /&gt;

Policies surrounding labor vary from location and type of facility, so labor processes can vary amongst women geographically and by socioeconomic status. In large public hospitals women who birth there tend to have some sort of Psychoprophylaxis class prior to going into labor. These are the equivalent of Lamaze classes, where women are taught techniques in preparation for childbearing without the use of anesthesia. Techniques include education, psychological and physical conditioning, and breathing exercises. These classes are not necessarily hospital affiliated (i.e. they are taught outside of the hospital and obstetricians do not directly refer women to them, so there is not a wide attendance). Women often laboring in these hospitals will have epidurals or other forms of analgesia, if deemed necessary. Family members are not allowed in labor unless the family member has also taken Psychoprophylaxis courses.&lt;ref name="MMInterview" /&gt;

In privately ran hospitals, women will often get discharged 24hrs after vaginal delivery and 48hrs following a [[Cesarean]]. Standard practice is that all laboring women have intravenous lines, pubic hair is not routinely shaved, and all primaparas are given episiotomies. In these hospitals the father or other family members are required to be present during labor and birth (even for Cesareans), although only one member is allowed to be present because of space. Presence of support system (family members or father) is also encouraged at prenatal visits. During labor women are allowed to walk, drink juice (among other liquids). Babies must remain with their mother’s postpartum because the only nursery available is meant for babies with low [[apgar scores]] and/or low temperatures, and even these babies are only kept under observation at the nursery for 3–4 hours.&lt;ref name="MMInterview" /&gt; Really sick babies who might need serious medical treatment are transferred elsewhere. Most, if not all, neonates are breastfed.

In local midwife practice, the homes the midwife would attend would often have no telephones, electricity, nor running water. She (the midwife) will bring an oxygen tank, [[Doppler unit]], [[Pitocin]] and [[methergine]] in case of hemorrhage, herbal tinctures, suture material, bulb syringe among other things. She might also bring a car in case emergency transportation is necessary. During labor the midwife will massage the laboring person with oils and use hot compresses, and encourage walking and position changes to facilitate labor. Delivery will often happen in a semi sitting or [[squatting position]]. After the baby is born the midwife will stay with the mother and baby from 2 - 4 hrs. She might use [[aceite de palo]] (plant oil extract) for the cord stump, which is to be applied with every diaper change to help disinfect and dry the cord rapidly.

==Birth==
Birth attendants can include a variety of providers, including general physicians (GP), obstetric nurses (ON), professional midwives (PM) and traditional birth attendants (TBA). ONs and PMs are not widely used in the hospital setting and physicians account for 87% of obstetric care in Mexico.&lt;ref name="skilled"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=D|last2=Demaria|first2=L.M.|last3=Suarez|first3=L|last4=Cragin|first4=L|title=Skilled Birth Attendants in Mexico:  How Does Care During Normal Birth by General Physicians, Obstetric Nurses, and  Professional Midwives Compare With World Health Organization Evidence-Based  Practice Guidelines?|journal=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health|date=2011|volume=57|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1111/j.1542-2011.2011.00075.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The education and outcomes for each profession are outlined here. The WHO-supported competencies for skilled birth attendants are met 43% by GP education, 54% by ON education, and 89% by PM education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cragin|first1=L|last2=DeMaria|first2=LM|last3=Campero|first3=L|last4=Walker|first4=DM|title=Educating skilled birth attendants in  Mexico: Do the curricula meet international confederation midwives standards?|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|date=2011|volume=15|issue=30|pages=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ON is educated at the University level while the PM must have completed secondary education and then a 3-year midwifery education program. A 2011 study found that PMs often have improved outcomes compared to GPs and ONs, possibly due to their apprentice-like education. GPs and ONs are associated with higher use of [[episiotomy]] and [[oxytocin]].&lt;ref name="skilled" /&gt;

TBAs have varying levels of education. ‘Traditional’ TBAs tend to live in remote indigenous regions and their knowledge is passed down through oral tradition. Trained TBAs have typically attended some form of institutional training program. Unskilled TBAs lack the generational knowledge of indigenous TBAs and do not have the education of the trained TBAs.&lt;ref name="trad" /&gt; While the overall number of hospital births and physician-based obstetric care has increased in recent years, maternal mortality has not significantly changed. This is because in rural states, 50% of births still occur at home either with or without a skilled birth attendant. Additionally, rural clinics tend to be staffed by GPs or medical students, who often lack obstetric experience or expertise.&lt;ref name="skilled" /&gt;  There is an 80.2% rate of institutional delivery, with 46.2% of births being C-section.&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt; In more traditional births, women are allowed to birth in whichever position is most comfortable for them, with many opting for a squatting position. In some cases, the spouse will hold the birthing woman as she pushes .&lt;ref name="MMInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trad" /&gt;

Pain relief is variable amongst women, with rates of pharmaceutical [[analgesia]] being higher in institutional births. This is further outlined in the section regarding labor. After the infant is expelled from the body, a TBA may stand in between the mother’s legs to prevent the heat of pregnancy escaping, which throws off the hot-cold balance.&lt;ref name="trad" /&gt; Once the placenta is delivered, it is typically set aside to be analyzed for completeness. Indication of a retained placenta can be cause for increased medical intervention. If the birth is taking place in a home, the birth attendant may bring the mother into a clinic or hospital in case of complication related to retained placenta. Traditionally, the placenta is buried at the home, with a male’s placenta being buried under the porch and a female’s being buried near the stove.&lt;ref name="trad" /&gt;

== Postpartum ==
Postpartum visits will often include family planning and teaching; still there are some similar beliefs across the board about the harmful effects of contraceptives. Especially since fertility is highly valued among the culture, pregnancy is viewed as a gift from God. In traditional practice it is believed that the maternal postpartum diet should only include chicken, burned tortillas, coffee and atole (corn and flour based beverage), nothing of a cold nature is allowed.&lt;ref name="MMInterview" /&gt; Shifts in modern medicine have a lot less restrictions, including a varied diet and milk. The biggest postpartum ritual in Mexico is the idea of the cuarentena. This is a forty-day postpartum period of rest, where women are supposed to avoid bathing, intimacy, and remain in some ways secluded. Family relatives (especially female family relatives) are supposed to help with cooking, cleaning, and taking care of the mother’s older children while she rests. Diet restrictions during cuarentena include no chili, other spices, cold foods, fish, pork and citrus. This is a practice that can be traced to biblical times (Leviticus 12 from the bible, this practice continues to play on the Catholic influence on the population’s overall culture).&lt;ref name="PiHW" /&gt; More midwives are teaching women to practice a prompt return to normal activity, instead of observing the cuarentena. Not observing the cuarentena was thought to lead to illness, infertility, infection and even death.

In private hospitals, patients will be seen as soon as a week after discharge for a complete check up. They will have follow up family planning visits one month into the postpartum period, women are then encouraged to have annual vaginal exams after the cuarentena. IUDs (Intrauterine Devices) are the most popular forms of contraception, these will be inserted during these visits.&lt;ref name="MMInterview" /&gt; Paternalism is a major cultural principle and practice that also plays out during postpartum visits because men tend to be very involved in the decision making of what kind of contraception may be used, if any.

==Newborns==
In Mexican culture, newborns are highly revered. The cuarentena period mentioned above is also largely for the newborn. The traditional cultural belief of “mal de ojo” is the main rationale behind this. It is believed that if the baby receives too much admiration from others, especially those outside of the family structure, that the baby will fall ill. For this reason, there are not any public ceremonies honoring the baby, though many families participate in a christening to thank God for the gift that they have been given. 
While the responsibility of caring for the newborn falls mainly on the mother, it is very common for the extended family to have a large part in child rearing. Often many families live in very close proximity, sometimes even in the same house as each other due to a strong emphasis placed on family values in Mexican culture. This transcends the nuclear family and extends into extended family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galanti|first1=G.A.|title=The hispanic family and male-female relationships: An overview|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=2003|volume=13|issue=3|pages=180–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the elders in the family are in charge of the care of the baby’s umbilical stump. The stump is covered by a coin and then the abdomen is wrapped tightly in a cloth, which is often red, as the color red is thought to ward off bad spirits. This dressing is changed daily, as it is thought necessary to place an herbal blend on the stump to aide in healing and prevent infection.&lt;ref name="MDM"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maldonado-Duran|first1=Martin|last2=Managua-Wellman|first2=Maria|last3=Lubin|first3=Sari|last4=Lartigue|first4=Teresa|title=Latino Families in the Perinatal Period: Cultural Issues in Dealing with the Health-Care  System|journal=Great Plains Research: A Journal of Natural and Social Sciences|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of purity is important when taking care of newborns in Mexican culture, and therefore most babies are not breastfed. Breastmilk is viewed as impure and unsafe. The breastfeeding rate at one month checkups is around 11%. Babies are generally exclusively formula fed until two to three months at which time non-milk items are added to their diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dimond|first1=H.J|last2=Ashworth|first2=A|title=Infant feeding practices in kenya, mexico and malaysia. the rarity of the exclusively breast-fed infant.|journal=Human Nutrition.Applied Nutrition|date=1987|volume=41|issue=1|pages=51–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Mexican culture, it is believed that in order to keep an infant pure of heart, and in turn healthy, they must never experience distress. For this reason, infants spend most of their time being held by a family member to prevent them from crying. As young newborns, they are also swaddled in blankets made by family members to make them feel safe. Co-sleeping and baby-wearing are also encouraged as they are thought to allow the infant to gain spiritual strength through their mother which will protect them from evil spirits and promote good health. In an effort to avoid upsetting the infant and putting them at risk of being impure, circumcision is discouraged in Mexico, with only 11% of infants becoming circumcised.&lt;ref name="MDM" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9058">'''Condom effectiveness''' is how effective [[Condom|condoms]] are at preventing [[Sexually transmitted infection|STDs]] and [[pregnancy]]. Correctly using [[Condom|male]] condoms and other barriers like [[Female condom|female condoms]] and [[Dental dam|dental dams]], every time, can reduce (though not eliminate) the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) and [[viral hepatitis]]. They can also provide protection against other diseases that may be transmitted through sex like [[Zika fever|Zika]] and [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]]. Using [[Condom|male]] and [[Female condom|female condoms]] correctly, every time, can also help prevent [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/|title=Condom Effectiveness|date=2018-02-15|website=CDC|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-09}}{{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent and correct use of male latex condoms can reduce (though not eliminate) the risk of STD transmission and pregnancy. To achieve the maximum protective effect, condoms must be used both consistently and correctly. Inconsistent use can lead to STD acquisition or pregnancy because transmission or conception can occur with a single act of intercourse. Similarly, if condoms are not used correctly, the protective effect may be diminished even when they are used consistently. The most reliable ways to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are to abstain from sexual activity or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner. However, many infected persons may be unaware of their infections because STDs are often asymptomatic or unrecognized.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/latex.html|title=Fact Sheet for Public Health Personnel - Condom Effectiveness|last=|first=|date=2018-02-15|website=CDC|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}} {{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male condom effectiveness at preventing STDs==
Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. In addition, consistent and correct use of latex condoms reduces the risk of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including diseases transmitted by genital secretions, and to a lesser degree, genital ulcer diseases. Condom use may reduce the risk for genital [[Human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus (HPV) infection]] and HPV-associated diseases, e.g., [[Genital wart|genital warts]] and [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;span name="STD"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;There are two primary ways that STDs are transmitted. Some diseases, such as HIV infection, [[gonorrhea]], [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], and [[trichomoniasis]], are transmitted when infected urethral or [[Vaginal discharge|vaginal secretions]] contact [[Mucous membrane|mucosal surfaces]] (such as the [[Urethra|male urethra]], the [[vagina]], or [[cervix]]). In contrast, genital ulcer diseases (such as [[genital herpes]], [[syphilis]], and [[chancroid]]) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are primarily transmitted through contact with infected skin or mucosal surfaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Laboratory studies have demonstrated that latex condoms provide an essentially impermeable barrier to particles the size of STD pathogens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Theoretical and empirical basis for protection ===

Condoms can be expected to provide different levels of protection for various STDs, depending on differences in how the diseases are transmitted. Condoms block transmission and acquisition of STDs by preventing contact between the condom wearer’s penis and a sex partner’s skin, mucosa, and genital secretions. A greater level of protection is provided for the diseases transmitted by genital secretions. A lesser degree of protection is provided for genital ulcer diseases or HPV because these infections also may be transmitted by exposure to areas (e.g., infected skin or mucosal surfaces) that are not covered or protected by the condom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Epidemiologic studies ===

Epidemiologic studies seek to measure the protective effect of condoms by comparing risk of STD transmission among condom users with nonusers who are engaging in sexual intercourse. Accurately estimating the effectiveness of condoms for prevention of STDs, however, is methodologically challenging. Well-designed studies address key factors such as the extent to which condom use has been consistent and correct and whether infection identified is incident (i.e. new) or prevalent (i.e. pre-existing). Of particular importance, the study design should assure that the population being evaluated has documented exposure to the STD of interest during the period that condom use is being assessed. Although consistent and correct use of condoms is inherently difficult to measure, because such studies would involve observations of private behaviors, several published studies have demonstrated that failure to measure these factors properly tends to result in underestimation of condom effectiveness.
Epidemiologic studies provide useful information regarding the magnitude of STD risk reduction associated with condom use. Extensive literature review confirms that the best epidemiologic studies of condom effectiveness address HIV infection. Numerous studies of discordant couples (where only one partner is infected) have shown consistent use of latex condoms to be highly effective for preventing sexually acquired HIV infection. Similarly, studies have shown that condom use reduces the risk of other STDs. However, the overall strength of the evidence regarding the effectiveness of condoms in reducing the risk of other STDs is not at the level of that for HIV, primarily because fewer methodologically sound and well-designed studies have been completed that address other STDs. Critical reviews of all studies, with both positive and negative findings (referenced here) point to the limitations in study design in some studies which result in underestimation of condom effectiveness; therefore, the true protective effect is likely to be greater than the effect observed.

Overall, the preponderance of available epidemiologic studies have found that when used consistently and correctly, condoms are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV infection and reduce the risk of other STDs''.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Male condom effectiveness at preventing pregnancy ==
The effectiveness of condoms at preventing pregnancy can be assessed two ways. ''Perfect use'' or ''method'' effectiveness rates only include people who use condoms properly and consistently. ''Actual use'', or ''typical use'' effectiveness rates are of all condom users, including those who use condoms incorrectly or do not use condoms at every act of intercourse. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use.&lt;ref name="hatcher"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html|title=Contraceptive Technology|last=Hatcher|first=RA|author2=Trussel, J|author3=Nelson, AL|publisher=Ardent Media|year=2007|isbn=1-59708-001-2|edition=19th|location=New York|display-authors=etal|accessdate=2009-07-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531095926/http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html|archivedate=May 31, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly the [[Pearl Index]] is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use [[Decrement table|decrement tables]].&lt;ref name="kippley"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of Natural Family Planning|last=Kippley|first=John|author2=Kippley, Sheila|publisher=The Couple to Couple League|year=1996|isbn=0-926412-13-2|edition=4th addition|location=Cincinnati, OH}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|141}}

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Conduct disorder''' ('''CD''') is a [[mental disorder]] diagnosed in childhood or adolescence that presents itself through a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major [[age-appropriate]] norms are violated.  These behaviors are often referred to as "[[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial behaviors]]."&lt;ref name="Hinshaw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinshaw|first1=S. P.|last2=Lee|first2=S. S.|date=2003|title=Conduct and oppositional defiant disorders: Child psychopathology|edition=E. J. Mash  &amp; R. A. Barkley|pages=144–198|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often seen as the precursor to [[antisocial personality disorder]], which is per definition not diagnosed until the individual is 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association| date= 2013| title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=5th| publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing| location=Arlington, VA| pages=659| isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Conduct disorder is estimated to affect 51.1 million people globally as of 2013.&lt;ref name=GBD2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=5 June 2015|pmid=26063472|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60692-4|pmc=4561509|volume=386|pages=743–800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

One of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear.  Research performed on the impact of toddlers exposed to fear and distress shows that negative emotionality (fear) predicts toddlers' empathy-related response to distress.  The findings support that if a caregiver is able to respond to infant cues, the toddler has a better ability to respond to fear and distress.  If a child does not learn how to handle fear or distress the child will be more likely to lash out at other children. If the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills, the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Spinrad, Tracy, and Cynthia Stifter. "Toddlers' Empathy-Related Responding to Distress: Predictions from Negative Emotionality and Maternal Behavior in Infancy." ''Infancy'' 10(2), 97-121, n.d. Web&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental course===
Currently, two possible developmental courses are thought to lead to conduct disorder. The first is known as the "childhood-onset type" and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present before the age of 10 years. This course is often linked to a more persistent life course and more pervasive behaviors.  Specifically, children in this group have greater levels of ADHD symptoms, neuropsychological deficits, more academic problems, increased family dysfunction, and higher likelihood of aggression and violence.&lt;ref name="Moff"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moffitt T.E. | year = 1993 | title = Life course persistent" and "adolescence-limited" antisocial behavior: A developmental taxonomy | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 674–701 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.100.4.674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate among professionals regarding the validity and appropriateness of diagnosing young children with conduct disorder. The characteristics of the diagnosis are commonly seen in young children who are referred to mental health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Volkmar F | year = 2002 | title = Considering disruptive behaviors | url = | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 159 | issue = | pages = 349–350 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.159.3.349 | pmid=11869994}}&lt;/ref&gt; A premature diagnosis made in young children, and thus labeling an individual, may be inappropriate. It is also argued that some children may not in fact have conduct disorder, but are engaging in developmentally appropriate disruptive behavior.

The second developmental course is known as the "adolescent-onset type" and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present after the age of 10 years.  Individuals with adolescent-onset conduct disorder exhibit less impairment than those with the childhood-onset type and are not characterized by similar psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moffitt T.E. |author2=Caspi A. | year = 2001 | title = Childhood predictors differentiate life-course life-course persistent and adolescence-limited antisocial pathways among males and females | doi = 10.1017/s0954579401002097 | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 355–375 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, these individuals will remit in their deviant patterns before adulthood. Research has shown that there is a greater number of children with adolescent-onset conduct disorder than those with childhood-onset, suggesting that adolescent-onset conduct disorder is an exaggeration of developmental behaviors that are typically seen in adolescence, such as rebellion against authority figures and rejection of conventional values.&lt;ref name="Moff" /&gt;  However, this argument is not established&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roisman G. I. | author2 = Monahan K. C. | author3 = Campbell S. B. | author4 = Steinberg L. | author5 = Cauffman E. | author6 = Early Child Care Research Network | year = 2010 | title = Is adolescence-onset antisocial behavior developmentally normative? | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 295–311 | doi=10.1017/s0954579410000076}}&lt;/ref&gt; and empirical research suggests that these subgroups are not as valid as once thought.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw" /&gt;

In addition to these two courses that are recognized by the [[DSM-IV-TR]], there appears to be a relationship among [[oppositional defiant disorder]], conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.  Specifically, research has demonstrated continuity in the disorders such that conduct disorder is often diagnosed in children who have been previously diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder, and most adults with antisocial personality disorder were previously diagnosed with conduct disorder.  For example, some research has shown that 90% of children diagnosed with conduct disorder had a previous diagnosis of [[oppositional defiant disorder]].&lt;ref name="Loeber"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Loeber R. |author2=Keenan K. |author3=Lahey B.B. |author4=Green S.M. |author5=Thomas C. | year = 1993 | title = Evidence for developmentally based diagnoses of oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 377–410 | doi=10.1007/bf01261600 | pmid=8408986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors, suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder.  However, this is not to say that this trajectory occurs in all individuals.  In fact, only about 25% of children with oppositional defiant disorder will receive a later diagnosis of conduct disorder.&lt;ref name="Loeber"/&gt;  Correspondingly, there is an established link between conduct disorder and the diagnosis of [[antisocial personality disorder]] as an adult.  In fact, the current diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder require a conduct disorder diagnosis before the age of 15.&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;  However, again, only 25-40% of youths with conduct disorder will develop antisocial personality disorder.&lt;ref name="OutcomeofCD"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zocccolillo M. |author2=Pickles A. |author3=Quinton D. |author4=Rutter M. | year = 1992 | title = The outcome of conduct disorder: Implications for defining adult personality disorder and conduct disorder | doi = 10.1017/s003329170003854x | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 971–986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, many of the individuals who do not meet full criteria for antisocial personality disorder still exhibit a pattern of social and personal impairments or antisocial behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rutter M | year = 1989 | title = Pathways from childhood to adult life | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 25–51 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1989.tb00768.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These developmental trajectories suggest the existence of antisocial pathways in certain individuals,&lt;ref name="Hinshaw" /&gt; which have important implications for both research and treatment.

===Associated conditions===
Children with conduct disorder have a high risk of developing other adjustment problems.  Specifically, risk factors associated with conduct disorder and the effects of conduct disorder symptomatology on a child's psychosocial context have been linked to overlap with other psychological disorders.&lt;ref name="McMahon, R. J. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McMahon R. J. |author2=Frick P. J. | year = 2005 | title = Evidenced-based assessment of conduct problems in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 477–505 | doi=10.1207/s15374424jccp3403_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, there seems to be reciprocal effects of [[comorbidity]] with certain disorders, leading to increased overall risk for these youth.

====Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder====
[[ADHD]] is the condition most commonly associated with conduct disorders, with approximately 25-30% of boys and 50-55% of girls with conduct disorder having a comorbid ADHD diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Waschbusch"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Waschbusch D. A. | year = 2002 | title = A meta-analytic evaluation of comorbid hyperactive-impulsive-inattention problems and conduct problems | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = | pages = 118–150 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.1.118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is unlikely that ADHD alone is a risk factor for developing conduct disorder, children who exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity along with aggression is associated with the early onset of conduct problems.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw" /&gt;  Moreover, children with comorbid conduct disorder and ADHD show more severe aggression.&lt;ref name="Waschbusch" /&gt;

====Substance use disorders====
Conduct disorder is also highly associated with both substance use and abuse.  Children with conduct disorder have an earlier onset of [[substance abuse|substance use]], as compared to their peers, and also tend to use multiple substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lynskey M. T. |author2=Fergusson D. M. | year = 1995 | title = Childhood conduct problems, attention deficit behaviors, and adolescent alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 281–302 | doi=10.1007/bf01447558}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, substance use disorders themselves can directly or indirectly cause conduct disorder like traits in about half of adolescents who have a substance use disorder.&lt;ref name="Brown-1996"/&gt; As mentioned above, it seems that there is a transactional relationship between substance use and conduct problems, such that aggressive behaviors increase substance use, which leads to increased aggressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=White H.R. |author2=Loeber R. |author3=Stouthamer-Loeber M. |author4=Farrington D.P. | year = 1999 | title = Developmental associations between substance use and violence | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 785–803 | doi=10.1017/s0954579499002321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substance use in conduct disorder can lead to antisocial behavior in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khalifa|first1=N|last2=Duggan|first2=C|last3=Howard|first3=R|last4=Lumsden|first4=J|title=The relationship between childhood conduct disorder and adult antisocial behavior is partially mediated by early-onset alcohol abuse.|journal=Personality disorders|date=October 2012|volume=3|issue=4|pages=423–32|pmid=22888992|doi=10.1037/a0027017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
While the cause of conduct disorder is complicated by an intricate interplay of biological and environmental factors, identifying underlying mechanisms is crucial for obtaining accurate assessment and implementing effective treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Murrihy, R., Kidman, A., &amp; Ollendick, T (2010). ''Clinical Handbook of Assessing and Treating Conduct Problems in Youth''. Springer: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms serve as the fundamental building blocks on which evidence-based treatments are developed.  Despite the complexities, several domains have been implicated in the development of conduct disorder including cognitive variables, neurological factors, intraindividual factors, familial and peer influences, and wider contextual factors.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw" /&gt;  These factors may also vary based on the age of onset, with different variables related to early (e.g., neurodevelopmental basis) and adolescent (e.g., social/peer relationships) onset.&lt;ref name="Passa"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Passamonti L. |author2=Fairchild G. |author3=Goodyer I. |author4=Hurford G. |author5=Hagan C. |author6=Rowe J. |author7=Calder A. | year = 2010 | title = Neural abnormalities in early-onset and adolescence-onset conduct disorder | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 7| pages = 729–738 | doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.75 | pmid=20603454 | pmc=4471104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks===
The development of conduct disorder is not immutable or predetermined.  A number of interactive risk and protective factors exist that can influence and change outcomes, and in most cases conduct disorder develops due to an interaction and gradual accumulation of risk factors.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Murray J. |author2=Farrington D. P. | year = 2010 | title = Risk factors for conduct disorder and delinquency: Key findings from longitudinal studies | url = | journal = The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 10| pages = 633–642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to the risk factors identified under cause, several other variables place youth at increased risk for developing the disorder, including child physical abuse&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; and prenatal alcohol abuse and maternal [[Smoking and pregnancy|smoking during pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Larkby C. A. |author2=Goldschmidt L. |author3=Hanusa B. H. |author4=Day N. L. | year = 2011 | title = Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with conduct disorder in adolescence: Findings from a birth cohort | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 262–271 | doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2010.12.004|pmc=3042714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protective factors have also been identified, and most notably include high IQ, being female, positive social orientations, good coping skills, and supportive family and community relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bassarath L | year = 2001 | title = Conduct disorder: A biopsychosocial review | url = | journal = The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 609–616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a mere correlation between a particular risk factor and a later developmental outcome (such as conduct disorder) cannot be taken as definitive evidence for a causal link. Co-variation between two variables can arise, for instance, if they represent age-specific expressions of similar underlying genetic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rutter M. | author2 = Moffi T. | author3 = Caspi A. | year = 2006 | title = Gene–environment interplay and psychopathology: Multiple varieties but real effects | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 226–261 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01557.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the tendency to smoke during pregnancy (SDP) is subject to substantial genetic influence (D'Onofrio et al., 2007), as is conduct disorder. Thus, the genes that dispose the mother to SDP may also dispose the child to CD following mitotic transmission. Indeed, Rice et al. (2009) found that in mother-fetus pairs that were not genetically related (by virtue of in-vitro fertilisation), no link between SDP and later conduct problems arose. Thus, the distinction between causality and correlation is an important consideration.{{full citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Learning disabilities===
While language impairments are most common,&lt;ref name="McMahon, R. J. 2005"/&gt; approximately 20-25% of youth with conduct disorder have some type of [[learning disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Frick P. J. |author2=Kamphaus R. W. |author3=Lahey B. B. |author4=Christ M. A. |author5=Hart E. L. |author6=Tannenbaum T. E. | year = 1991 | title = the vast majority of these have ADHD. Academic underachievement and the disruptive behavior disorders | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 289–294 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.59.2.289}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the relationship between the disorders is complex, it seems as if learning disabilities result from a combination of ADHD, a history of academic difficulty and failure, and long-standing socialization difficulties with family and peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hinshaw S.P. | year = 1992 | title = Externalizing behavior problems and academic underachievement in childhood adolescence: Causal relationships and underling mechanisms | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.111.1.127 | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 127–155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, confounding variables, such as language deficits, SES disadvantage, or neurodevelopmental delay also need to be considered in this relationship, as they could help explain some of the association between conduct disorder and learning problems.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw" /&gt;

===Cognitive factors===
In terms of cognitive function, intelligence and cognitive deficits are common amongst youths with conduct disorder, particularly those with early-onset and have intelligence quotients (IQ) one standard deviation below the mean&lt;ref&gt;Lynham, D. &amp; Henry, B. (2001). The role of neuropsychological deficits in conduct disorders. In J. Hill &amp; B. Maughan (Eds.), ''Conduct disorders in childhood and adolescence'' (pp.235-263). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and severe deficits in verbal reasoning and [[Executive functions|executive function]].&lt;ref&gt;Moffitt, T. &amp; Lynam, D. (1994).

Goodman (Eds.), ''Progress in experimental personality and psychopathology research'' (pp. 233-262). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Executive function difficulties may manifest in terms of one's ability to shift between tasks, plan as well as organize, and also inhibit a prepotent response.  These findings hold true even after taking into account other variables such as socioeconomic status (SES), and education. However, IQ and executive function deficits are only one piece of the puzzle, and the magnitude of their influence is increased during transactional processes with environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pennington B. |author2=Benneto L. | year = 1993 | title = Main effects or transactions in the neuropsychology of conduct disorder? Commentary on "The neuropsychology of conduct disorder | url = | journal = Developmental Psychopathology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 153–164 | doi=10.1017/s0954579400004314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain differences===
Beyond difficulties in executive function, neurological research on youth with conduct disorder also demonstrate differences in brain anatomy and function that reflect the behaviors and mental anomalies associated in conduct disorder.  Compared to normal controls, youths with early and adolescent onset of conduct disorder displayed reduced responses in brain regions associated with social behavior (i.e., amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex).&lt;ref name="Passa" /&gt; In addition, youths with conduct disorder also demonstrated less responsiveness in the orbitofrontal regions of the brain during a stimulus-reinforcement and reward task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Finger E. |author2=Marsh A. |author3=Blair K. |author4=Reid M. |author5=Sims C. |author6=Ng P. |author7=Pine D. |author8=Blair R. | year = 2011 | title = Disrupted reinforcement signaling in the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate in youths with conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder and a high level of psychopathic traits | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 168 | issue = 2| pages = 152–162 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10010129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides a neural explanation for why youths with conduct disorder may be more likely to repeat poor decision making patterns.  Lastly, youths with conduct disorder display a reduction in grey matter volume in the amygdala, which may account for the fear conditioning deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Raine A | year = 2011 | title = An amygdale structural abnormality common to two subtypes of conduct disorder: A neurodevelopmental conundrum | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.11030416 | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 168 | issue = 6| pages = 569–571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduction has been linked to difficulty processing social emotional stimuli, regardless of the age of onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fairchild G. |author2=Passamonti L. |author3=Hurford G. |author4=von dem Hagan C. |author5=Hagen E. |author6=van Goozen S. |author7=Goodyer I. |author8=Calder A. | year = 2011 | title = Brain structure abnormalities in early-onset and adolscent-onset conduct disorder | url = | journal = Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 168 | issue = 6| pages = 624–633 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10081184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Aside from the differences in neuroanatomy and activation patterns between youth with conduct disorder and controls, neurochemical profiles also vary between groups.&lt;ref name="Capp"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Cappadocia | first1 = MC. | last2 = Desrocher | first2 = M. | last3 = Pepler | first3 = D. | last4 = Schroeder | first4 = JH. | title = Contextualizing the neurobiology of conduct disorder in an emotion dysregulation framework. | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 506–18  v|date=Aug 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.06.001 | PMID = 19573964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with conduct disorder are characterized as having reduced serotonin and cortisol levels (e.g., reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis), as well as reduced autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning.  These reductions are associated with the inability to regulate mood and impulsive behaviors, weakened signals of anxiety and fear, and decreased self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Capp" /&gt; Taken together, these findings may account for some of the variance in the psychological and behavioral patterns of youth with conduct disorder.

===Intra-individual factors===
Aside from findings related to neurological and neurochemical profiles of youth with conduct disorder, intraindividual factors such as genetics may also be relevant.  Having a sibling or parent with conduct disorder increases the likelihood of having the disorder, with a heritability rate of .53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gelhorn H.

Social, emotional, and personality development'' (5th ed., pp.779-862). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family and peer influences===
Elements of the family and social environment may also play a role in the development and maintenance of conduct disorder.  For instance, antisocial behavior suggestive of conduct disorder is associated with single parent status, parental divorce, large family size, and young age of mothers.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw" /&gt;  However, these factors are difficult to tease apart from other demographic variables that are known to be linked with conduct disorder, including poverty and low [[socioeconomic status]].  Family functioning and parent-child interactions also play a substantial role in childhood aggression and conduct disorder, with low levels of parental involvement, inadequate supervision, and unpredictable discipline practices reinforcing youth's defiant behaviors.  
Peer influences have also been related to the development of antisocial behavior in youth, particularly peer rejection in childhood and association with deviant peers.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw" /&gt;  Peer rejection is not only a marker of a number of [[Externalizing Disorders|externalizing disorders]], but also a contributing factor for the continuity of the disorders over time.  Hinshaw and Lee (2003)&lt;ref name="Hinshaw" /&gt; also explain that association with deviant peers has been thought to influence the development of conduct disorder in two ways: 1) a “selection” process whereby youth with aggressive characteristics choose deviant friends, and 2) a “facilitation” process whereby deviant peer networks bolster patterns of antisocial behavior. In a separate study by Bonin and colleagues, parenting programs were shown to positively affect child behavior and reduce costs to the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bonin EM, Stevens M, Beecham J, Byford S, Parsonage M | year = 2011 | title = Costs and longer-term savings of parenting programmes for the prevention of persistent conduct disorder: a modelling study | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 11 | issue = | page = 803 | doi=10.1186/1471-2458-11-803 | pmid=21999434 | pmc=3209459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider contextual factors===
In addition to the individual and social factors associated with conduct disorder, research has highlighted the importance of environment and context in youth with antisocial behavior.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw" /&gt;  However, it is important to note that these are not static factors, but rather transactional in nature (e.g., individuals are influenced by and also influence their environment).  For instance, neighborhood safety and exposure to violence has been studied in conjunction with conduct disorder, but it is not simply the case that youth with aggressive tendencies reside in violent neighborhoods.  Transactional models propose that youth may resort to violence more often as a result of exposure to community violence, but their predisposition towards violence also contributes to neighborhood climate.

==Diagnosis==
Conduct disorder is classified in the fourth edition of ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM).&lt;ref name ="APA"&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text revision). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; It is diagnosed based on a prolonged pattern of antisocial behaviour such as serious violation of laws and [[social norm]]s and rules in people younger than the age of 18. Similar criteria are used in those over the age of 18 for the diagnosis of [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="pmid20964942"&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Murray J |author2=Farrington DP |date=Oct 2010 |title=Risk factors for conduct disorder and delinquency: key findings from longitudinal studies. |journal=Can J Psychiatry. |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=633–42  |pmid=20964942  }}&lt;/ref&gt; No proposed revisions for the main criteria of conduct disorder exist in the ''[[DSM-5]]''; there is a recommendation by the work group to add an additional specifier for [[callous and unemotional traits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2010 |title= DSM 5 Development: Conduct Disorder |url= http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=370Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to DSM-5 criteria for conduct disorder, there are four categories that could be present in the child's behavior: aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, and serious violation of rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first= | last= American Psychiatric Association | year= 2013 | title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders | edition=Fifth | publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing | location=Arlington, VA | pages=469–470 | isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all adolescents who have a substance use disorder have conduct disorder-like traits, but after successful treatment of the substance use disorder, about half of these adolescents no longer display conduct disorder-like symptoms. Therefore, it is important to exclude a substance-induced cause and instead address the substance use disorder prior to making a psychiatric diagnosis of conduct disorder.&lt;ref name="Brown-1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Brown | first1 = SA. | last2 = Gleghorn | first2 = A. | last3 = Schuckit | first3 = MA. | last4 = Myers | first4 = MG. | last5 = Mott | first5 = MA. | title = Conduct disorder among adolescent alcohol and drug abusers. | journal = J Stud Alcohol | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 314–24 |date=May 1996 | doi =  10.15288/jsa.1996.57.314| PMID = 8709590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

The most effective treatment for an individual with conduct disorder is one that seeks to integrate individual, school, and family settings. Additionally, treatment should also seek to address familial conflict such as marital discord or maternal depression.

==Prognosis==
About 25-40% of youths diagnosed with conduct disorder qualify for a diagnosis of [[antisocial personality disorder]] when they reach adulthood. For those that do not develop ASPD, most still exhibit social dysfunction in adult life.&lt;ref name="OutcomeofCD"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Conduct disorder is estimated to affect 51.1 million people globally as of 2013.&lt;ref name=GBD2015/&gt; The percentage of children affected by conduct disorder is estimates to range from 1-10%.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw" /&gt; However, among incarcerated youth or youth in juvenile detention facilities, rates of conduct disorder are between 23% and 87%.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice. (2006).  Psychiatric disorders of youth in detention (NCJ 210331)Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex differences===
The majority of research on conduct disorder suggests that there are a significantly greater number of males than females with the diagnosis, with some reports demonstrating a threefold to fourfold difference in prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;Lahey, B. B., Miller, T. L., Gordon, R. A., &amp; Riley, A. W. (1999).  Developmental epidemiology of the disruptive behavior disorders.  In H. C. Quay &amp; A. E. Hogan (Eds.), Handbook of disruptive disorders (pp. 23-48).  New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this difference may be somewhat biased by the diagnostic criteria which focus on more overt behaviors, such as aggression and fighting, which are more often exhibited by males.  Females are more likely to be characterized by covert behaviors, such as stealing or running away.  Moreover, conduct disorder in females is linked to several negative outcomes, such as antisocial personality disorder and early pregnancy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Loeber R. |author2=Burke J.D. |author3=Lahey B.B. |author4=Winters A. |author5=Zera M. | year = 2000 | title = Oppositional defiant and conduct disorder: a review of the past 10 years, part I. | url = | journal = American Academy Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 1468–1484 | doi=10.1097/00004583-200012000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that sex differences in disruptive behaviors need to be more fully understood.

Females are more responsive to peer pressure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keenan Kate | author2 = Loeber Rolf | author3 = Green Stephanie | year = 1999 | title = Conduct Disorder in Girls: A Review of the Literature | url = | journal = Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review | volume = 2 | issue = 1| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; including feelings of guilt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stanger Nicholas | author2 = Kavussanu Maria | author3 = Ring Christopher | year = 2012 | title = Put Yourself in Their Boots: Effects of Empathy on Emotion and Aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 208–22 | doi=10.1123/jsep.34.2.208}}&lt;/ref&gt; than males.

===United States===
Research on racial or cultural differences on the prevalence or presentation of conduct disorder is limited. However, it appears that African-American youth are more often diagnosed with conduct disorder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=DelBello M. P. |author2=Lopez-Larson M. P. |author3=Soutullo C.

'''Constantin "Jumate" Rădulescu''' (30 May 1924 – 2001&lt;ref name="gsp.ro"/&gt;), commonly known as '''Dr. Constantin Rădulescu''', was a Romanian [[Doctor of Medicine|doctor]], [[Association football|footballer]] and [[Manager (association football)|manager]]. As a footballer he played mainly as a [[midfielder]].

In 2005, as a tribute to the work done in building and rising the club, [[CFR Cluj]] renamed its stadium as [[Stadionul Dr. Constantin Rădulescu]].&lt;ref name="gsp.ro"/&gt;

==Club career==
===Early years of football (Olympia and Sportul)===
Born in [[Bucharest]], Rădulescu started his career at [[Olympia București]] then moved to [[FC Sportul Studențesc București|Sportul Studențesc]] in 1942, for which he played in 8 matches in the [[Liga I|Divizia A]].

===Universitatea Cluj===
In 1943 the doctor signed with [[FC Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], team that played at [[Sibiu]] in that period as a consequence of the territorial agreement known as the [[Second Vienna Award]], by which [[Northern Transylvania]] became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] as a result of [[World War II]] events. That team would be known as a symbol of the [[Romania]]n resistance in [[Transylvania]]. In 1949 he left "U" as a result of some misunderstandings and would declare later in his book, ''O viaţă închinată fotbalului'' (A life dedicated to football): ''Honestly, I split hard and regretfully from this wonderful team, which deserves any superlatives.''&lt;ref name="prosport.ro"&gt;{{cite web|title= Alungat de "U", a construit CFR-ul! Citeşte povestea fondatorului alb-vişiniilor
|url=http://www.prosport.ro/fotbal-intern/liga-1/alungat-de-u-a-construit-cfr-ul-citeste-povestea-fondatorului-alb-visiniilor-8086404|publisher=prosport.ro|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CFR Cluj===
After leaving "U", Constantin Rădulescu chose to continue his career at the rival CFR, known at the time as ''Locomotiva'', a small team that still did not seem to become the Universitatea's bitter rival. For CFR he played 6 years and retired in 1956, at only 31 years old due to a serious injury.&lt;ref name="prosport.ro"/&gt;

==Manager career==
===Early years===
After reitrement the doctor started immediately his football manager career at CFR and after some seasons in the [[Liga II|Divizia B]] and [[Liga III|Divizia C]] he signed with his first love, [[FC Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], known at that time as ''Știința'', but only resisting one season in this position.&lt;ref name="gsp.ro"&gt;{{cite web|title= Ferguson din Gruia
|url=http://cfrmania.gsp.ro/stiri/2367/ferguson-din-gruia.htm|publisher=cfrmania.gsp.ro|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Creator of CFR Cluj===
In the summer of 1963 he went back to [[CFR Cluj]], known at that time as ''CSM Cluj'', and would begin the building of the team that later would become the bitter rival of Universitatea. In 1969 he succeeded the first [[Liga I|Divizia A]] promotion in the history of CFR, managing to maintain the team on the first stage of the [[Romania]]n football until 1976 and at the end of [[1972–73 Divizia A|1972–73]] season, a 5th place, the best ranking in history of the club until 2006. These performances are all the more incredible as the team has inadequate training, organizational and financial conditions, Rădulescu was telling in his book: ''No finances and players, no headquarters, secretary or organizer. So we started in the first league in 1969.''&lt;ref name="prosport.ro"/&gt;

After relegation he moved back to "U" for one season, then reaching lower league teams such as CUG Cluj or [[ACS Sticla Arieșul Turda|Sticla Arieșul Turda]].&lt;ref name="gsp.ro"/&gt;

In 1992 at 68 years old the doctor returned to his creation, CFR, and managed the team for 3 years in [[Liga III]], helping at the creation of the team that would promote a year later.&lt;ref name="gsp.ro"/&gt;

==Playing and Managing style==
As a player, Rădulescu turned [[throw-in]]s into real [[corner kick]]s.&lt;ref name="gsp.ro"/&gt;

As a manager he is considered a real [[Alex Ferguson]] of [[CFR Cluj]] by former player Marius Bretan and former player Romică Petrescu said: ''[[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and CFR used the same training methods. The training cycle was taken from Ajax, with two training sessions on Tuesday, two on Thursday, free on Wednesday. Everything was done counter-clockwise, after pulse, after tension.''&lt;ref name="gsp.ro"/&gt;

Augustin Ţegean, a CFR legend described him: ''A distinct character from all points of view: tough, severe, does not give up his principles. He always told us that he was only allowed to make fun because he was from [[Bucharest]]. He was a strong personality, we all respected him. We were afraid of him. [..] I can say he was using new methods for those times. He explained the game schemes on the board. The marks were made man-to-man. Everyone knew exactly what area to cover on the pitch. His methods were the most modern.''&lt;ref name="gsp.ro"/&gt;

==Trivia==
''He refused the national team so that he would not lose his doctor's position'', told the doctor's daughter, Ioana Stanca Gidro. In 1972, the Minister of Transport asked him to take over [[FC Rapid București|Rapid București]], but he refused again, this time using a tertip, demanding that [[Răducanu Necula|Rică Răducanu]], a legend of Rapid, to be kicked out.&lt;ref name="gsp.ro"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Rădulescu's daughter, Stanca Ioana Gidro is a lawyer and former dean of the [[Cluj-Napoca]] Bar, among other.&lt;ref name="prosport.ro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanca Ioana GIDRO|url=https://www.juridice.ro/stanca-ioana-gidro|publisher=juridice.ro|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental issues in Afghanistan''' predate the political turmoil of the past few decades. [[Forests]] and [[wetlands]] have been depleted by centuries of [[grazing]] and [[farming]], practices which have only increased with modern population growth. In [[Afghanistan]], environmental conservation and economic concerns are not at odds; with 80% of the population dependent on [[herding]] or farming, the welfare of the environment is critical to the economic welfare of the people.&lt;ref name='unep'&gt;

[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Stopping timber smuggling.jpg|thumb|[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldiers intercept [[illegal timber]] as it is smuggled through the Narang Valley the [[Kunar Province]] into neighboring [[Pakistan]].]]
Much of the population depends on forests for [[firewood]] and the revenue generated by export of [[pistachio]]s and [[almond]]s, which grow in natural woodlands in the central and northern regions. The [[Badghis Province|Badghis]] and [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] provinces have lost more than 50% of pistachio woodland. During the conflicts of the past few decades, residents and the militias such as the [[Northern Alliance]] have used wood for fuel, and these militia forces have cleared trees which could have provided hiding places for ambushes from their opponents. Further, the use of the woodlands for grazing ground and the collection of nuts for export apparently prevent new pistachio trees from growing.&lt;ref name='unep' /&gt;

Denser forests in the eastern [[Nangarhar Province|Nangarhar]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]], and other provinces are at risk from [[timber]] harvesting by timber mafia. Although the [[logging]] is illegal, profits from exporting the timber to neighboring Pakistan are very high. The reason for this is that Pakistani government has its forests tightly protected so the timber mafia are busy cutting down trees in Afghanistan instead. The timber makes its way not only to [[Peshawar]] but also to [[Islamabad]], [[Rawalpindi]], and [[Lahore]], where most of it is used to make expensive furnitures.

As forest cover decrease, the land becomes less and less productive, threatening the livelihood of the rural population and the floods are washing the agricultural lands and destroying the houses. Loss of vegetation also creates a higher risk of floods, which not only endanger the people, but cause [[soil erosion]] and decrease the amount of land available for [[agriculture]]. To tackle this problem, the Afghan government and agencies from a number of [[NATO]] states have teamed up over the past several years to turn Afghanistan green again by planting new trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Afghanistan: Tree-Planting Effort Aims To Put Color Back In Kabul's Former 'Green Zone' |author=Ron Synovitz |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1052030.html |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL) |date=March 24, 2004 |accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Citizens Plant 1.2 Million Trees in Eastern Afghanistan |url=http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/USAID/Article/611/Citizens_Plant_12_Million_Trees_in_Eastern_Afghanistan |publisher=[[United States Agency for International Development]] |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=2012-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307045142/http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/USAID/Article/611/Citizens_Plant_12_Million_Trees_in_Eastern_Afghanistan |archivedate=March 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key Afghan, US leadership plant trees for Farmer’s Day |author=Lt. j.g.

==Wildlife==
{{main|Wildlife of Afghanistan}}
With very little government infrastructure to discourage [[hunting]], and habitat disappearing because of conflict and drought, much of the country's wildlife is at risk. In 2006, Afghanistan and the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] began a three-year project to protect wildlife and habitats along the [[Wakhan Corridor]] and Central Plateau regions.&lt;ref name='wildlands'&gt;

==Water management==

[[File:Flood prevention -a.jpg|thumb|A recently built irrigation system for better [[water management]]]]
The primary threat to Afghanistan's water supply is the [[Drought in Afghanistan|droughts]], which created food shortages for millions in the recent past.&lt;ref name='drought'&gt;
{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-06-15}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting agricultural crises between 1995 and 2001 have driven major migrations from rural to urban areas.&lt;ref name='droughtmap'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
In response to drought, deep wells for irrigation have been drilled which decreased the under ground water level, further draining groundwater resources, which rely on rain for replenishment.

By 2003, about 99% of the [[Sistan]] wetlands were dry, another result of continued drought and lack of [[water management]].&lt;ref name='wetlands'&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The wetlands, an important habitat for breeding and migrant waterfowl including the [[dalmatian pelican]] and the [[marbled teal]], have provided water for agricultural [[irrigation]] for at least 5,000 years. They are fed by the [[Helmand River]], which ran at 98% below average in drought years 2001-2003. As in other areas of the country, the loss of natural vegetation resulted in soil erosion; here, [[sandstorms]] submerged as many as 100 villages by 2003.&lt;ref name='unep'/&gt;

Some of the major [[reservoir|water reservoirs]] and [[dam]]s include the following:
*[[Dahla Dam]]
*[[Naghlu Dam]]
*[[Darunta Dam]]
*[[Kajaki Dam]]
*[[Lake Qargha]]

==Pollution==
Urban populations have swelled in the past several years. Since 2002, over 5 million former refugees living in [[Afghans in Pakistan|Pakistan]] and [[Afghans in Iran|Iran]] have returned home to Afghanistan. Many of these settled in the capital Kabul, which also include migrants that have come from drought-ravaged rural areas.

===Nuclear waste by Pakistan===
In 2008, the Afghan government alleged that Pakistan had dumped [[nuclear waste]] in southern Afghanistan during the Taliban rule (1994-2001). Farooq Wardak, [[National Assembly of Afghanistan|Afghan Parliamentary affairs minister]], said the government was setting up a commission to investigate the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7323920.stm |title=Pakistan 'dumped nuclear waste' |first=Martin |last=Vennard |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] recently announced that his administration will investigate the matter.

===Domestic and industrial waste===
[[File:Kabul City.jpg|thumb|Kabul City, the capital of Afghanistan]] 
In 2002, the [[United Nations]] Environment Programme found that a lack of waste management systems was creating dangerous conditions in several urban areas.&lt;ref name='unep' /&gt; In Kabul's districts 5 and 6, household and medical waste was discarded on streets. Human waste was contained in open sewers, which flowed into the [[Kabul River]] and contaminated the city’s drinking water.

Urban dumpsites are used in lieu of managed [[landfills]] in Kabul, [[Kandahar]] and [[Herat]], often without protection of nearby rivers and groundwater supplies. [[Medical waste]] from hospitals is disposed in the dumpsites with the rest of the cities’ waste, contaminating water and air with [[bacteria]] and [[viruses]].

Lack of sewage management is not unique to Kabul. In urban areas, open sewers are common while wastewater treatment is not. Much of the urban water supply is contaminated by [[Escherichia coli]] and other bacteria.

[[Oil refineries]] are another source of water contamination. In Herat and [[Mazar-e-Sharif]], crude oil spills and leaks are uncontained and unsafe levels of [[hydrocarbon]]s reach residential water supplies.

===Air pollution===
Air pollution does not constitute a major problem in Afghanistan, but its reliance on inexpensive energy has created some issues. Most vehicles run on [[diesel fuel]], and household energy often rely on burning wood and other materials. As a result, air pollution in urban areas is visible and may pose health issues.&lt;ref name='unep' /&gt;&lt;ref name='mother'&gt;

The '''European Sleep Apnea Database''' (ESADA) (also referred to with spelling '''European Sleep Apnoea Database'''&lt;ref name="clinicalgenomics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="europeanrespiratoryjournal" /&gt; and '''European Sleep Apnoea Cohort'''&lt;ref name="rightvision" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dailythepak" /&gt;) is a collaboration between European sleep centres as part of the [[European Cooperation in Science and Technology]] (COST) Action B 26. The main contractor of the project is the [[Sahlgrenska University Hospital|Sahlgrenska Academy]] at [[Gothenburg University]], Institute of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, and the co-ordinator is [[Jan Hedner]], MD, [[PhD]], Professor of Sleep Medicine.&lt;ref name="europeanrespiratoryjournal"&gt;Hedner 2011, pp. 635–642.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Clinical Genomics: Practical Applications for Adult Patient Care'' said ESADA was an example initiatives which afford an "excellent opportunity" for future collaborative research into [[genetics|genetic]] aspects of [[obstructive sleep apnea syndrome]] (OSAS).&lt;ref name="clinicalgenomics" /&gt; Both the [[European Respiratory Society]] and the European Sleep Research Society have noted the impact for research cooperative efforts of the database resource.&lt;ref name="esrsmarch2013" /&gt;

==History==

===2006 – 2010===
In 2006 the European Sleep Apnea Database (ESADA) began as an initiative between 27 European sleep study facilities to combine information and compile it into one shared resource.&lt;ref name="esrsmarch2013"&gt;''ESRS Newsletter'' 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grote"&gt;Grote 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed as part of the [[European Cooperation in Science and Technology]] (COST) Action B 26.&lt;ref name="europeanrespiratoryjournal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obesity"&gt;''Obesity, Fitness &amp; Wellness Week'' 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to financial help from COST, the initiative received assistance from companies [[Respironics|Philips Respironics]] and [[ResMed]].&lt;ref name="grotemay2012"&gt;Grote May 2012, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The database storing the association's resource information is located in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="grotemay2012" /&gt; The group's goal was twofold: to serve as a reference guide to those researching sleep disorders, and to compile information about how different caregivers treat patients suffering from sleep apnea.&lt;ref name="europeanrespiratoryjournal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obesity" /&gt;

5,103 patients were tracked from March 2007 to August 2009.&lt;ref name="obesity" /&gt; Data collected on these patients included symptoms suffered, medication, medical history, and sleep data, all inputted into an online format for further analysis.&lt;ref name="obesity" /&gt; Database researchers reported on their methodology and results in 2010 to the [[American Thoracic Society]], on their observed findings regarding percentages of metabolic and cardiovascular changes related to patients with obstructive sleep apnea.&lt;ref name="americanthoracicsociety"&gt;Hedner 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 research resulted from collaboration between 22 study centres across 16 countries in Europe involving 27 researchers.&lt;ref name="americanthoracicsociety" /&gt; The primary participants who presented to the American Thoracic Society included researchers from: [[Sahlgrenska University Hospital]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]; [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]], [[Haifa]], [[Israel]]; National TB &amp; Lung Diseases Research Institute, [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]; CNR Institute of Biomedicine and Molecular, [[Palermo]], [[Italy]]; Instituto Auxologico Italiano, Ospedale San Luca, [[Milan]], [[Italy]]; and St. Vincent University Hospital, [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="americanthoracicsociety" /&gt; Their analysis was published in 2010 in the ''[[American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine]]''.&lt;ref name="americanthoracicsociety" /&gt;

In 2011 there were 22 sleep disorder centres in [[Europe]] involved in the collaboration.&lt;ref name="europeanrespiratoryjournal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obesity" /&gt; The group published research in 2011 analyzing the percentage of patients suffering from sleep apnea that have [[obesity]].&lt;ref name="obesity" /&gt; By 2012 the database maintained information on over 12,500 patients in Europe; it also contained [[DNA sample]]s of 2,600 individuals.&lt;ref name="grotemay2012" /&gt; ESADA was represented in 2012 at the 21st annual meeting of the European Sleep Research Society in [[Paris]], [[France]], and was one of four European Sleep Research Networks that held a session at the event.&lt;ref name="esrs2012"&gt;''ESRS Newsletter'' 2012, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Escourrou and Fadia Jilwan wrote a 2012 article for the ''[[European Respiratory Journal]]'' after studying data from ESADA involving 8,228 total patients from 23 different facilities.&lt;ref name="escourrou" /&gt; They analyzed whether [[polysomnography]] was a good measure for [[hypopnea]] and sleep apnea.&lt;ref name="escourrou"&gt;Escourrou 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the department of [[pulmonary disease]]s at [[Turku University Hospital]] in [[Turku]], [[Finland]] compared variations between sleep centres in the ESADA database and published their findings in the ''European Respiratory Journal''.&lt;ref name="saaresranta"&gt;Saaresranta 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They looked at the traits of 5,103 patients from 22 centres.&lt;ref name="saaresranta" /&gt; They reported on the average age of patients in the database, and the prevalence by region of performing sleep study with cardiorespiratory polygraphy.&lt;ref name="saaresranta" /&gt;

The database added a centre in [[Hamburg, Germany]] in 2013 managed by [[physician]] Holger Hein.&lt;ref name="grote" /&gt; The group's annual meeting in 2013 was held in [[Edinburgh]], [[United Kingdom]] and was run by Renata Riha.&lt;ref name="grote" /&gt; By March 2013, there were approximately 13,000 total patients being studied in the program, with about 200 additional patients being added into the database each month.&lt;ref name="esrsmarch2013" /&gt; Analysis published by researchers from Italy and Sweden in September 2013 in the ''European Respiratory Journal'' analyzed if there was a correlation between [[renal function]] problems and obstructive sleep apnea.&lt;ref name="marrone"&gt;Marrone 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They analyzed data from 17 countries in Europe representing 24 sleep centres and 8,112 total patients.&lt;ref name="marrone" /&gt; They tested whether patients of different types of demographics with other existing health problems had a change in probability of kidney function problems, if they concurrently suffered from obstructive sleep apnea.&lt;ref name="marrone" /&gt;

In 2014, researchers released data studying 5,294 patients from the database compared prevalence of sleep apnea with increased [[blood sugar]].&lt;ref name="healthcarepurchasing"&gt;''Healthcare Purchasing News'' 2014, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Their results were published in the ''European Respiratory Journal''.&lt;ref name="rightvision"&gt;''Right Vision News'' 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailythepak"&gt;''Daily The Pak Banker'' 2014&lt;/ref&gt; They studied [[glycated hemoglobin]] levels in the patients and compared them with measured severity in sleep apnea.&lt;ref&gt;''The Huffington Post'' 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers analyzed glycated hemoglobin levels among a class of individuals with less severe sleep apnea and those with a higher determined amount of sleep apnea problems.&lt;ref name="healthcarepurchasing" /&gt; As of 20 March 2014 the database included information on a total of 15,956 patients.&lt;ref name="grote" /&gt; A 2014 article in the ''European Respiratory Journal'' drawing from the ESADA analyzed whether lack of adequate oxygen during a night's sleep was an indicator for [[high blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;Tkacova 2014, pp. 931–941&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In the 2013 book ''Clinical Genomics: Practical Applications for Adult Patient Care'', ESADA is said to be an example of the kind of initiative which affords an "excellent opportunity" for future collaborative research into [[genetics|genetic]] aspects of [[obstructive sleep apnea syndrome]] (OSAS).&lt;ref name="clinicalgenomics"&gt;Murray 2013, p. 586.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[European Respiratory Society]] and the European Sleep Research Society have noted the impact for research cooperative efforts of the database resource.&lt;ref name="esrsmarch2013" /&gt;

A '''flexible barge''' is a fabric barge (non-rigid) for the transportation of [[Bulk cargo|bulk fresh water]] or other liquid bulk items such as chemicals or oil.

==History==
One such barge is called the [[Dracone Barge]] invented in 1956. Other similar devices are the Spragg Bag invented in the 1980s, the water bag proposed by Nordic Water Supply in the late 1990s and the more recent REFRESH modular waterbag, developed in the 2010s. Terry Spragg of [[Manhattan Beach, California]], builds flexible fabric barges for the transportation of bulk fresh water and is the reason why his product is referred to as the "Spragg Bag."&lt;ref name="waterbag"&gt;[http://www.waterbag.com/ Waterbag web-site]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s Spragg was a promoter of icebergs as a large source of fresh water, but soon realized this was impractical.&lt;ref&gt;New times, Volume 11, p. 62, Newspaper "Trud", 1978, University of Michigan, Google Digitized Jan 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He then put his skills into developing the waterbag technology starting in the 1980s. Spragg has worked on and perfected this over the last twenty years with his associates. The first field test of his waterbag was in December 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterbag.com/history/history.htm Waterbag History and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; The waterbag was {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} long and it contained approximately {{convert|3000|m3|USgal}} of fresh water. It was towed from the Port Angeles harbor in the state of Washington. Another test was done in 1996 with a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} voyage from Port Angeles to [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref name="Gleick"&gt;Gleick, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; This test ended on April 29 when the fabric of one of the two bags under tow developed a tear. Spragg says that his next goal is to run another test voyage demonstration between Northern and Southern California and a demonstration of the waterbag technology in the Middle East as well as around the world. There are various reasons why it has been difficult to gain support for demonstrating the viability of waterbag technology in California and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aguanomics.com/2009/02/persistance-and-baggs.html Aguanomics: Persistance &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; – and Baggs], February 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aguanomics.com/2009/09/fear-and-water-managers.html Aguanomics: Fear and Water Managers], September 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Spragg claims when two waterbags pass underneath the Golden Gate Bridge for the first time in history the media will let the whole world know about it.&lt;ref name="wake"&gt;Emily Bouckaert [http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2010/world/freshwater-delivery-in-the-wake-of-natural-disasters/ Freshwater Delivery in the Wake of Natural Disasters], Circle of Blue, March 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronicle1999"&gt;San Francisco Chronicle, August 6, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2010/05/gulf-oil-spill-army-corps-of-engineers-dredging.html Gulf oil spill: Should the U.S. Army Corps start dredging?], Los Angeles Times – Environment, May 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A novel, ''Water, War, and Peace,'' has been completed that details the solutions waterbag technology offers to the complex political problems surrounding water issues throughout the Middle East, the United States, and the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterbag.com/novel/rights.htm Water, War, and Peace (a novel)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterbag.com/novel/chapter.htm Water, War, and Peace by Terry G. Spragg &amp; Associates, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nordic Water Supply waterbag.jpg|thumb|175x175px|Nordic Water Supply waterbag]]
The Norwegian company Nordic Water Supply developed a 10.800 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bag in 1997 under an agreement with the Turkish government to transport freshwater to [[Northern Cyprus]]. Within two years at least 7 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water had to be delivered annually at a cost of €2.7M per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Exporting Water to the World|last = Anderson|first = T.L.|date = 2011|journal = Journal of Contemporary Water Research and Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; with volumes growing over time, but the actual transport only amounted to 4 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in four years and the contract was discontinued by Turkish authorities. As a result, NWS went out of business and was [[List of companies delisted from Oslo Stock Exchange|de-listed from the Oslo Stock Exchange]] in 2003. NSW's waterbag technology was acquired by the Monohakobi Institute of Technology in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.nri.com/global/opinion/papers/2011/pdf/np2011160.pdf|title = Blue gold in Japan: policy idea on creating a new water trading system coping with expected water issue in Japan based on comparison stuides|last = Uemura|first = Tetsuji|date = February 2011|journal = NRI papers|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:REFRESH waterbag.jpg|thumb|REFRESH waterbag|184x184px]]
The REFRESH waterbag was developed by a consortium of companies and research institutes from Greece, Spain, Italy, Turkey and the Czech Republic within two [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|European FP7 projects]], REFRESH (running from 2010 to 2012) and the follow-up XXL-REFRESH (running from 2013 to 2015). The first project was focused on validation of the concept of modular waterbag; it developed a small scale prototype of 200 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; capacity, tested in Greece in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.euronews.com/2012/12/06/bags-of-water/|title = Euronews - Bags of water|date = |access-date = 2016-02-22|website = |publisher = Euronews|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second project was focused on scale-up and partial redesign of the REFRESH system. At the end of the second project the REFRESH waterbag concept reached commercial scale and a 2500 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; system made of five 500m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; modules was tested offshore Spain in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.euronews.com/2016/01/25/the-big-bag-theory-a-cheap-and-innovative-way-to-transport-fresh-water/|title = Euronews - the big bag theory: a cheap and innovative way to transport fresh water|date = |access-date = 2016-02-22|website = |publisher = Euronews|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the waterbag was 60 m long.

The REFRESH concept is different from concepts of waterbag proposed earlier, based on huge monolithic containers (as the one proposed by Nordic Water Supply) or "trains" of smaller containers each one being sealed in itself (as the Spragg bag). The REFRESH waterbag is made of a series of modules, each one being a cylinder open at both bases, joined by watertight zippers. This makes it possible to perform all "dry" operations on ground at the level of single modules, overcoming the handling problems of monolithic containers and improves the behaviour in navigation with respect to the "trains" of connected bags.

==Technology==
[[File:Spragg Waterbag.jpg|thumb|Flexible barge filled with fresh water]]
[[File:Spragg Bag zipper.jpg|thumb|Flexible barge zipper|168x168px]]

The 1995 associated Spragg patents (#5,413,065 and #5,488,921) indicate that the inventions relate to a flexible fabric barge technology or combination of several barges&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onthecolorado.org/Resources/Purveyors/AugmPapers/OceanRouteImports.pdf ''Water imports using ocean routes'', Section 1.4.3 Water Bags]&lt;/ref&gt; made of a rubber [[polyurethane]] material. The main body portion of a flexible fabric barge is cylindrical in shape.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt; The barge can be used by itself or as several connected flexible fabric barges that can be towed through the open ocean under extreme conditions. The patents further explain that the goal of Spragg's inventions are a practical water delivery system of fresh drinkable water that could be delivered to dry regions worldwide that have a shortage of [[potable]] water.

One of the flexible fabric barge concepts aims at an economical delivery system for fresh water that would be considerably cheaper than [[desalination plant]]s, rigid [[ship]]s, [[tank truck|tanker trucks]], [[barge|conventional barge]]s, [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s or [[pipeline transport]]. Waterbags are more economical and better for the environment than desalination of the seas and oceans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterbag.com/economi/desalin.htm Desalination vs. Waterbags]&lt;/ref&gt;

The flexible fabric barge is a [[plastic container]] that is buoyant. It can be linked together with an attachment system to other flexible fabric barges to make a "train." The "waterbags", which are sometimes referred to as balloons or bladders, are made up of a vinyl lining inside a stronger material net.&lt;ref name="Seattle"&gt;Seattle Times-News, Feb 20, 1994, p. 30 ''Floating a plan to ship fresh water to California''&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of "fabric water pipeline" when several are strung together for transport of liquids by tugboat through seas or open oceans to remote locations.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;Lawrence Journal-World – April 27, 1996 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zipper===

Zippers play an important part in extending the capacity of the waterbag beyond what is practically achievable by a single textile piece. The Spragg and REFRESH concepts both feature prominently zippers, albeit with a fundamental difference in its function.

In the Spragg design, large waterbags are connected together like [[boxcar]]s in a "train" fashion to increase the amount of liquids delivered at a time. It is estimated that the flexible barges could be as large as 14 meters in diameter and 150 meters in length, holding up to 17,000 cubic meters of fresh water or any other transportable liquid. Theoretically as many as 50 to 60 "waterbags" could be connected to one another and towed, although such a test has not been done to date. 
[[File:REFRESH fabric equipped with zipper.jpg|thumb|REFRESH waterbag's fabric with embedded zipper|173x173px]]Engineers suggest that the fabric barge can hold a "train" of {{convert|4,500,000|USgal|m3}} of liquids.
A zipper coupler system is 10 times stronger than what is pulled by a 4,300&amp;nbsp;hp tug.&lt;ref name="bollard"&gt;[http://www.sawmillcove.com/board/2010/062210/COIbulkwater.pdf Bulk Water Exports – Status Report], May 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Laborde Marine estimates a 4,300 horsepower tug with a [[bollard pull]] of 110,000 pounds can pull a "train" of fifty or so flexible barges weighing up to 1,300,000 tons.&lt;ref name="bollard" /&gt; The "train" speed would be about 3 knots.&lt;ref name="bollard" /&gt; This is over {{convert|700|acre.ft|hl}} of fresh water or other liquid per trip.&lt;ref name="bollard" /&gt;

In the REFRESH design, the container itself is assembled on shore starting from planar cuts of fabric. Zippers run all along the perimeter of the fabric and make it possible to join an indefinite number of modules. Since each module is not closed by itself, zippers need to be watertight in order to ensure that no seawater leaks in.

[[File:Spragg Bag coupler.jpg|thumb|Spragg Flexible barges coupled with zippers]]

The basic invention is a device for the delivery of huge amounts of fresh water (700,000 to {{convert|4,500,000|USgal|m3}} in each bag) at one time in a hostile wind and wave environment typical of oceans and large seas.&lt;ref name="waterbag"/&gt; Since [[freshwater]] is lighter than [[seawater]] the filled "bladders"&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8qcyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7uYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5159,4246208&amp;dq=spragg+bags&amp;hl=en Giant water bags proposed to quench a dry planet's thirst], The Seattle Times, reprinted by Lawrence Journal – World – Apr 27, 1996, p. 4 The giant bladders, each which holds {{convert|4.5|e6USgal|m3}}....&lt;/ref&gt; (as they are sometimes referred to&lt;ref&gt;Westneat, ''The giant bladders, each of which holds {{convert|4.5|e6USgal|m3}}, or as much water as 45,000 Seattleites use in a day, would form a flexible "fabric water pipeline" through the ocean.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FRESH+WATER+-+BY+THE+BAG+INVENTION+WILL+HELP+WORLD'S+DRY+REGIONS,...-a064935863 FRESH WATER – BY THE BAG INVENTION WILL HELP WORLD'S DRY REGIONS, MILLIONAIRE SAYS.]&lt;/ref&gt;) float on top, similarly to [[iceberg]]s, with little above the surface and most below the surface. Fresh water can be taken from rivers just before it discharges into salty seas or oceans, which then would not interfere with [[salmon run|salmon spawning]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;

The associated coupler and zipper patent describes that to be economically feasible there should be several such flexible barges towed at one time. The greater the volume of water that can be delivered per trip, the better the economics. This string of barges would typically consist of barges in size from 25 to {{convert|50|ft|m}} in diameter and 200 to {{convert|800|ft|m}} in length each.

The unique characteristic of the Spragg Bag system is not the large volume of water in each bag, but what is called the world's strongest zipper (produced by Italian company Ziplast) that allows connection of several bags together in long trains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siswebs.org/water/story.php?title=WATERBAG_TECHNOLOGY_AND_INTER-STATE_WATER_TRANSFERS WATERBAG TECHNOLOGY AND INTER-STATE WATER TRANSFERS]&lt;/ref&gt; The large connecting zipper can be operated manually or by remote control with radio signals. The string of such flexible fabric "waterbags" may be coupled to a barge via a reinforced fabric nose cone where a tow line is attached.

The REFRESH scheme is enabled by a specialty zipper, again developed by Ziplast, that uses a completely different tooth engagement design able to keep the strength of the original "Spragg" zipper while adding watertightness. Tests performed by the Spanish research centre [[:es:Ciencia y tecnología de la Comunidad Valenciana|AIMPLAS]] have confirmed that the zipper is able to stay watertight even when in tension.

Each "waterbag" is generally filled to 80-90% capacity (so that it is not stiff and remains able to adapt to deformations when turning) and is flat across its top.

==Economics==
[[File:CH2M-HILL loading system.jpg|thumb|{{convert|500,000|acre.ft|m3}} per year waterbag loading system designed by CH2M-HILL]]

One San Francisco area reporter writes that waterbag technology would provide economical fresh water delivery to the [[Monterey Peninsula]] district and a solution to the shortage of fresh water in the area. He reports that the average family of four uses one acre-foot of water a year. This costs over $1000 for delivery using conventional methods, however this same amount of water delivered by Spragg Bags would cost about 30% less.&lt;ref name="Chronicle1999"/&gt; Another newspaper reporter explains that towing Spragg Waterbags is environmentally friendly and is more economical than carrying water in ships or water tanker trucks or even using conventional rigid pipelines.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt; An article in the July issue of ECONOMIST Magazine in 2008 explains that worldwide there is enough water for all, however most is often in the wrong place at the wrong time and it is just too expensive to transport.&lt;ref&gt;ECONOMIST Magazine, July 19, 2008, ''Water A soluble problem.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterbag technology offers an easy and inexpensive solution to the problem of today's expensive conventional water transportation. It eliminates the difficulty of transporting water long distances by using the ocean as the means of transport. Waterbags considerably lower the capital costs and operating costs of moving fresh water from place to place. If a train was able to only move one or two box cars at a time, rather than in a train of dozens of boxcars at a time, it would not be very efficient and extremely expensive. Linking waterbags into "trains" of strings of waterbags and moving them through the ocean increases the economics of water transportation making it a viable practical option.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;

The cost to transport water 300 to {{convert|800|mi|km}} through the ocean, based on deliveries of {{convert|5|e6USgal/d|m3/d}} to {{convert|10|e6USgal/d|m3/d}}, is estimated to be between $350 to $450 per acre foot, depending on the length of the voyage and the amount of water delivered per trip. Increasing the amount of water delivered per day in each waterbag train will help to significantly reduce the cost of the water delivered. Once the reliability of the waterbag delivery system has proven its economics and reliability it will just be a matter of adding more waterbags to the trains, and more trains to the system in order to increase the amount of water delivered to selected locations, while also reducing the cost of the water delivered. Based on the increasing reliability of the waterbag delivery system over time, it should be possible to be able to economically deliver 100,000's of acre feet per year to many coastal locations around the world.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the inventor of the Spragg bag, the total cost of delivering fresh water down the California coast by his waterbag technology for a distance of {{convert|800|mi|km}} from [[British Columbia, Canada|British Columbia]] to [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] would cost about $966 per acre-foot per year. Keith Spain in a study for a Master Of Arts then shows in an analysis that it would save the residents of the [[Monterey Peninsula]] some $1,134 per-acre foot otherwise using a [[desalination plant]]. This is a savings of over $19 million per year for the Monterey taxpayers. This number assumes a usage of approximately {{convert|17,000|acre.ft|m3}} per year (17,000 X $1,134 = $19,278,000 savings).&lt;ref name="KeithSpain"&gt;[http://www.commercialdiplomacy.org/pdf/ma_projects/spain_keith.pdf Monterey Institute of International Studies Master of Arts in Commercial Diplomacy by Keith Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Spragg Bag with camera crew on top.jpg|thumb|Flexible barge with camera crew on top filming an actual application.]]

One application seen is in the Middle East where large quantities of fresh water that are available in the Turkey region could be delivered to other places around the Mediterranean Sea that have an extreme shortage of drinkable fresh water, like Israel and Gaza.&lt;ref name="Westneat"&gt;Westneat, The San Diego Union – Tribune, April 28, 1996. p. A-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popular Mechanics, March 1997, "Tech Update" ''Water goes by water''&lt;/ref&gt; Spragg believes that delivering fresh drinking water to water-poor nations can promote world peace.&lt;ref name="ChristianMonitor"&gt;[http://www.uri.edu/artsci/ecn/starkey/201-590_bulletinboard/water.pdf Forget OPEC. The next cartel may export drinking water.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fridell, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli President Shimon Peres has written a letter in support of implementing a demonstration of Spragg Bag technology in the Mediterranean Sea as a tool for helping to bring Peace to the Middle East. In this letter President Peres states, "The draft of WATER, WAR AND PEACE written as a novel is in my view an original approach to highlight this grave problem and its solutions, that will pave the path to a better and more peaceful region. Your efforts to embark on a demonstration voyage to enlighten us all, both regarding the technological viability as well as cost, will surely contribute to meet the critical dilemma."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterbag.com/novel/ShimonLetter.pdf Shimon Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also points out that using waterbags towed through the Mediterranean Sea would be much more economical than transporting water through pipeline systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=170117&amp;bolum=100 Waterbag technology may help solve water crisis in Middle East] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012064332/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=170117&amp;bolum=100 |date=October 12, 2012 }}, Today's Zaman, March 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This view is shared by the REFRESH consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Development of Modular reconfigurable waterbag for long haul freshwater transport over sea, presentation given at Malta Water Week 2015|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterbags have been proposed to be used for emergency purposes in order to link the Gulf Cooperation Counsel countries' desalination plants all along the [[Persian Gulf]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/business/who-has-a-spare-1m-to-prove-that-water-can-float Who has a spare $1m to prove that water can float?], The National, September 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application is the regular delivery of fresh water over long distance routes.

Proposed routes include from the state of Washington to dry regions of Southern California, from [[Mad River (California)|Mad River]] in Northern California to the San Francisco area&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northcoastjournal.com/news/2009/10/22/cup-runneth-over/ Cup runneth Over], The journal, Humboldt County, California, cover story by Heidi Walters, Oct 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and from Southern Chile to [[Atacama Region|Atacama]]. Other applications are that it:

* could be used to move water through the Sacramento River Delta following an earthquake and a catastrophic levee collapse that could cut off Southern California's water supply for up to two years or more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-op-starrlevees20nov20,0,5126052.story California's calamity in waiting], Los Angeles Times, November 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* could deliver large quantities of stormwater and/or [[recycled water]] to areas that need more fresh water to offset lower water levels and rising salinity.
* could be pre-positioned storage worldwide of large quantities of fresh [[drinking water]] for quick delivery after a natural disaster.&lt;ref name="wake"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/gleick/detail?entry_id=48993 Safe water during disasters: Preparing better for the inevitable], Dr. Peter Gleick (President of Pacific Institute) October 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Spragg has proposed to deliver water from the [[Manavgat River]] in Turkey across the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to Israel and the Gaza Strip, which has an extreme shortage of water, which presently is being reviewed by the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name="Westneat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danny Westneat [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960426&amp;slug=2326086 Fresh Water – By The Bag – Invention Will Help World's Dry Regions, Millionaire Says], Seattle Times, April 26, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Spragg has proposed to the Australian government that bulk fresh drinking water using his waterbag technology could be applied to urban water supplies that have a shortage. It would establish an economically sound new industry for bulk fresh water transport. An analysis of the economic and environmental advantages for waterbag technology by using the ocean currents from the Tully River to Brisbane, Queensland has been completed.
On the Gold Coast the Tugan desalination plant is being built to supply 120 [[Litre#SI prefixes applied to the litre|megaliters]] of drinking water daily at a cost of approximately $1.2 billion. Operation of the Tugan desalination plant will produce 235,000 tons of [[Greenhouse gas|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greenhouse gases]] annually. Preliminary cost estimates indicate that using waterbag technology to deliver the same amount of water from the Tully river to the Gold Coast may be 30 times less expensive than desalination, and that waterbag technology may emit 60 times less greenhouse gas. These figures suggest that waterbag technology would deliver water for much less cost than the proposed pipeline from the Burdekin River to Brisbane which is projected to cost approximately $7.5 billion for infrastructure and about $250 million for annual operation.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Edmonds [http://www.solartran.com.au/tullywater.htm Northern River Water for Australian Cities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spragg has proposed to the White House the idea of a peace offering in the Middle East by supplying 20 to 30 of his waterbags with fresh water and transport them from Turkey to the Palestinians and Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uri.edu/artsci/ecn/starkey/201-590_bulletinboard/water.pdf University of Rhode Island report of Christian Monitor report]&lt;/ref&gt; The technology could also be used for the collection of Australia's factory waste water outputs, storm water, and sewerage for processing and reuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lizpenfold.com/speeches-pdfs/wat_swb_speech_mar_2008.pdf Liz Penford speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustatory technology''' is the engineering discipline dealing with [[taste|gustatory]] representation.

== Description ==
Virtual taste refers to a taste experience generated by a digital taste simulator. Electrodes are used to simulate the taste and feel of real food in the mouth.&lt;ref name=turk&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turk|first1=Victoria|title=Face electrodes let you taste and chew in virtual reality|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2111371-face-electrodes-let-you-taste-and-chew-in-virtual-reality/|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist Ltd.|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012 a team of researchers at the National University of Singapore developed the [[digital lollipop]], an electronic device capable of transmitting four major [[taste]] sensations (salty, sour, sweet and bitter) to the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029444.500-electrode-recreates-all-four-tastes-on-your-tongue.html |title=Electrode recreates all four tastes on your tongue - 20 November 2013 |publisher=New Scientist |date=2013-11-20 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the same team created a square with thermoelectric elements to simulate the sensation of sweetness through changes in temperature. If this system is implemented in mugs or drinking glasses, it could make low-sugar drinks taste sweeter helping people reduce sugar intake. 
A team from the University of Tokyo created a device that simulates the different textures of food through electricity. The device uses electrodes place on the masseter muscle (a jaw muscle used for chewing) and simulates the texture by changing this muscle frequency. For example, a higher frequency gives the food a harder texture.&lt;ref name=turk/&gt;

'''Harold R. McCluskey''' (July 12, 1912 &amp;ndash; August 17, 1987) was a [[chemical technician|chemical operations technician]] at the [[Hanford Site|Hanford]] Plutonium Finishing Plant located in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] State who is known for having survived, on August 30, 1976, exposure to the highest dose of radiation from [[americium]] ever recorded. He became known as the 'Atomic Man'.&lt;ref name=tristateherald&gt;{{cite news |first=Annette |last=Cary |title=Doctor remembers Hanford's 'Atomic Man' |newspaper=[[Tri-City Herald]] |url= http://www.hanfordnews.com/news/2008/story/11403.html |date=April 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 6, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210232231/http://www.hanfordnews.com/news/2008/story/11403.html |archivedate = February 10, 2010 | deadurl = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
On August 30, 1976, McCluskey, then 64, was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for [[americium-241]], a [[plutonium]] byproduct, as the result of an accident in a [[glove box]] resulting in an explosion. As [[nitric acid]] was added to a column containing an [[ion-exchange resin]] and americium, the chemicals exploded, blowing out the leaded glass of the glove box.&lt;ref name=tristateherald/&gt; Harold was exposed to at least 37 MBq of americium-241 and nitric acid.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{cite magazine |last=González |first=Abel J. |date=September 1999 |title=Strengthening the Safety of Radiation Sources &amp; the Security of Radioactive Materials: Timely Action |volume=14 | issue=3 |url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull41-3/41302080217.pdf#page=14 |magazine=IAEA Bulletin |location= |publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] |access-date=March 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was hit on the right side by a mixture of nitric acid, broken glass, americium and ion exchange resin.&lt;ref name="dademoeller.com"&gt;{{cite speech |title=The 1976 Hanford Americium Accident, Then and Now |first=Eugene H. |last=Carbaugh |author-link= |event=59th Annual Meeting of the Health Physics Society |location=Baltimore, MD |date=July 14, 2014 |url=https://www.dademoeller.com/dademoellerblog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-Americium-Incident-Carbaugh.pdf |access-date=March 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- source post-dates creation of this article, refers to it in section on social media / public perception --&gt;

Harold was helped from the room, had his clothing removed and was washed with water at the scene. He was transferred to a decontamination facility where he was washed again and given a dose of one gram of Ca-DTPA on arrival. For the first week he had two baths per day, then he had one bath per day for two months. For the first five days he was treated with the calcium complex of [[DTPA]] and then after that for four years he was treated with a total of 583 grams of the zinc complex of DTPA. The treatment reduced the systemic deposition to 500 kBq instead of the 19 MBq which he would otherwise retained inside his body.

Because of risk of exposure to other individuals, he was placed in isolation in the Hanford Emergency Decontamination Facility for five months and underwent [[chelation therapy]] using [[DTPA]] by Dr. Bryce Breitenstein.&lt;ref name=tristateherald/&gt; By 1977, his body's radiation count had fallen by about 80 percent. When McCluskey returned home, friends and church members avoided him. His minister finally had to tell people it was safe to be around him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=June 3, 2005 |title=Hanford nuclear workers enter site of worst contamination accident |newspaper=[[Billings Gazette]] |access-date=March 6, 2017 |url=http://www.billingsgazette.com/index.php?id=1&amp;display=rednews/2005/06/03/build/nation/94-contamination.inc |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013185723/http://www.billingsgazette.com/newdex.php?display=rednews%2F2005%2F06%2F03%2Fbuild%2Fnation%2F94-contamination.inc |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although McCluskey largely avoided the media, Breitenstein said McCluskey sometimes accompanied him when he gave lectures on the case.&lt;ref name=tristateherald/&gt; "He really wanted people to know what happened as long as it is rationally presented," Breitenstein said. Several times after the explosion, McCluskey spoke in favor of developing nuclear power, saying he saw his injuries as the result of "purely an industrial accident."
 
He died on August 17, 1987, of [[coronary artery disease]]. He had this disease before the accident, and a post mortem examination found no signs of cancer. At the time of his death he had 55 kBq of americium in his soft tissues (27.9 kBq in the liver), 470 kBq in the mineral surfaces of the bones and bone marrow contained 20 kBq of americium.&lt;ref name="dademoeller.com"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Hashimoto's thyroiditis''', also known as '''chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis''' and '''Hashimoto's disease''', is an [[autoimmune disease]] in which the [[thyroid|thyroid gland]] is gradually destroyed.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Hashimoto's disease|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/hashimotos-disease|publisher=Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=17 July 2017|date=12 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728031758/https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/hashimotos-disease|archivedate=28 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on there may be no symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Over time the thyroid may enlarge forming a painless [[goiter]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Some people eventually develop [[hypothyroidism]] with its accompanying [[weight gain]], [[fatigue (medical)|feeling tired]], [[constipation]], [[Mood disorder|depression]], and general pains.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size.&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Hashimoto's Disease|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/endocrine/hashimotos-disease/Pages/fact-sheet.aspx|website=NIDDK|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822021514/https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/endocrine/hashimotos-disease/Pages/fact-sheet.aspx|archivedate=22 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential complications include [[thyroid lymphoma]].&lt;ref name=Nou2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noureldine|first1=SI|last2=Tufano|first2=RP|title=Association of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and thyroid cancer.|journal=Current Opinion in Oncology|date=January 2015|volume=27|issue=1|pages=21–5|pmid=25390557|doi=10.1097/cco.0000000000000150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
There are many symptoms that are attributed to Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Hashimoto's disease.  The most common symptoms include the following: [[Fatigue (medicine)|fatigue]], weight gain, pale or puffy face, feeling cold, [[Arthralgia|joint]] and [[Myalgia|muscle pain]], [[constipation]], dry and thinning hair, [[Menorrhagia|heavy menstrual flow]] or [[Metrorrhagia|irregular periods]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[panic disorder]], a [[Bradycardia|slowed heart rate]], and [[Infertility|problems getting pregnant]] and maintaining pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hashimotos-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20351855|title=Hashimoto's disease - Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hashimoto’s disease is about seven times more common in women than in men. It can occur in teens and young women, but more commonly shows up in middle age, particularly for men. People who develop Hashimoto’s disease often have family members who have thyroid or other [[autoimmune diseases]], and sometimes have other autoimmune diseases themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/hashimoto-disease.html | title=Hashimoto's disease fact sheet | publisher=Office on Women's Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, womenshealth.gov (or girlshealth.gov) | date=16 July 2012 | accessdate=23 November 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202154021/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/hashimoto-disease.html | archivedate=2 December 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thyroid gland may become firm, large, and [[lobulated]] in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but changes in the thyroid can also be nonpalpable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yvZ9965dqxAC&amp;pg=PA56 Page 56] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321091318/https://books.google.com/books?id=yvZ9965dqxAC&amp;pg=PA56 |date=21 March 2017 }} in: {{cite book |author=Staecker, Hinrich; Thomas R.

Physiologically, [[antibody|antibodies]] against [[thyroid peroxidase]] (TPO) (also called TPOAb) and/or [[thyroglobulin]] cause gradual destruction of [[thyroid follicle|follicles]] in the [[thyroid]] gland. Accordingly, the disease can be detected clinically by looking for these antibodies in the blood. It is also characterized by invasion of the thyroid tissue by [[leukocytes]], mainly [[T-cell|T-lymphocytes]]. A rare but serious complication is [[thyroid lymphoma]], generally the B-cell type, [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0215/p1047.html#afp20000215p1047-b7 | title=Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis | journal=American Family Physician | volume=61 | issue=4 | date=1996 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | vauthors=Dayan CM, Daniels GH | pages=335:99–107 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413143539/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0215/p1047.html#afp20000215p1047-b7 | archivedate=13 April 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
The strong genetic component is borne out in studies on monozygotic twins, with a concordance of 38-55%, with an even higher concordance of circulating thyroid antibodies not in relation to clinical presentation (up to 80% in monozygotic twins). Neither result was seen to a similar degree in dizygotic twins, offering strong favour for high genetic aetiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1740-2557-2-1 |year=2005 |last1=Chistiakov |first1=Dimitry A |journal=Journal of Autoimmune Diseases |volume=2 |pages=1 |pmid=15762980 |title=Immunogenetics of Hashimoto's thyroiditis |issue=1 |pmc=555850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is associated with ''[[CTLA-4]]'' (''Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Antigen-4'') gene polymorphisms. CTLA-4 downregulates., i.e. transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells so reduced functioning is associated with increased T-lymphocyte activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.2007-0147 |title=Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Antigen 4 Gene Polymorphisms and Autoimmune Thyroid Disease: A Meta-Analysis |year=2007 |last1=Kavvoura |first1=F.

Having other autoimmune diseases is a risk factor to develop Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and the opposite is also true.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Autoimmune diseases most commonly associated to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis include [[celiac disease]], [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]], [[vitiligo]], and [[alopecia]].&lt;ref name=Radetti2014&gt;{{Cite book| author=Radetti G| title=Clinical aspects of Hashimoto's thyroiditis | journal=Endocr Dev | year= 2014 | volume= 26 | pages= 158–70 | pmid=25231451 | doi=10.1159/000363162 | type= Review | series=Endocrine Development | isbn=978-3-318-02720-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preventable environmental factors, including high iodine intake, [[selenium deficiency]], as well as infectious diseases and certain drugs, have been implicated in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease in genetically predisposed individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000324442 |title=Why is the Thyroid So Prone to Autoimmune Disease |year=2011 |last1=Saranac |first1=L. |last2=Zivanovic |first2=S. |last3=Bjelakovic |first3=B. |last4=Stamenkovic |first4=H. |last5=Novak |first5=M. |last6=Kamenov |first6=B. |journal=Hormone Research in Paediatrics |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=157–65 |pmid=21346360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genes implicated vary in different ethnic groups and the incidence is increased in people with chromosomal disorders, including [[Turner syndrome|Turner]], [[Down syndrome|Down]], and [[Klinefelter syndrome]]s usually associated with autoantibodies against [[thyroglobulin]] and [[thyroperoxidase]]. Progressive depletion of these cells as the cytotoxic immune response leads to higher degrees of primary hypothyroidism, presenting with low [[thyroid hormone|T3/T4]] levels, and compensatory elevations of TSH.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Pathophysiology==
There are multiple suggested mechanisms by which the pathology of Hashimoto's thyroiditis develops.

Various autoantibodies may be present against [[thyroid peroxidase]], [[thyroglobulin]] and [[TSH receptors]], although a small percentage of people may have none of these antibodies present. As indicated in various twin studies a percentage of the population may also have these antibodies without developing Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Nevertheless, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is a substantial factor behind the apoptotic fall-out of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ([[CD8]]+ T-cells) in response to cell-mediated immune response affected by helper T-lymphocytes ([[CD4]]+ T-cells) is central to thyrocyte destruction. As is characteristic of [[Type IV hypersensitivity|type IV hypersensitivities]], recruitment of [[macrophages]] is another effect of the helper T-lymphocyte activation, with [[T helper cell|Th1]] axis lymphocytes producing inflammatory [[cytokines]] within thyroid tissue to further macrophage activation and migration into the thyroid gland for direct effect.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Gross morphological changes within the thyroid are seen in the general enlargement which is far more locally nodular and irregular than more diffuse patterns (such as that of [[hyperthyroidism]]). While the capsule is intact and the gland itself is still distinct from surrounding tissue, microscopic examination can provide a more revealing indication of the level of damage.&lt;ref name="Kumar2010" /&gt;

Histologically, the hypersensitivity is seen as diffuse parenchymal infiltration by lymphocytes, particularly [[Plasma cell|plasma B-cells]], which can often be seen as secondary lymphoid follicles (germinal centers, not to be confused with the normally present colloid-filled [[Thyroid follicle|follicles]] that constitute the thyroid). Atrophy of the colloid bodies is lined by [[Hurthle cell|Hürthle cells]], cells with intensely [[Eosinophilia|eosinophilic]], granular cytoplasm, a [[metaplasia]] from the normal cuboidal cells that constitute the lining of the thyroid follicles. Severe thyroid atrophy presents often with denser fibrotic bands of [[collagen]] that remains within the confines of the thyroid capsule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Mechanisms of Disease|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|edition=8th|pages=1112–1113|chapter=24: The Endocrine System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis is usually made by detecting elevated levels of [[anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies]] (TPOAb) in the serum, but seronegative (without circulating autoantibodies) thyroiditis is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grani|first1=Giorgio|last2=Carbotta|first2=Giovanni|last3=Nesca|first3=Angela|last4=D’Alessandri|first4=Mimma|last5=Vitale|first5=Martina|last6=Del Sordo|first6=Marianna|last7=Fumarola|first7=Angela|title=A comprehensive score to diagnose Hashimoto's thyroiditis: a proposal|journal=Endocrine|volume=49|issue=2|pages=361–5|date=4 October 2014|doi=10.1007/s12020-014-0441-5|pmid=25280964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the relatively [[non-specific symptom]]s of initial hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is often misdiagnosed as [[Major Depressive Disorder|depression]], [[cyclothymia]], [[premenstrual syndrome|PMS]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[fibromyalgia]] and, less frequently, as [[erectile dysfunction]]  or  an [[anxiety disorder]]. On gross examination, there is often presentation of a hard [[goiter]] that is not painful to the touch;&lt;ref name="Kumar2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Mechanisms of Disease|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|edition=8th|page=1113|chapter=24: The Endocrine System}}&lt;/ref&gt; other symptoms seen with hypothyroidism, such as periorbital [[myxedema]], depend on the current state of progression of the response, especially given the usually gradual development of clinically relevant hypothyroidism. Testing for [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), [[thyroid hormone|free T3, free T4]], and the anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO, or TPOAb) and anti-microsomal antibodies can help obtain an accurate diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Giannini |first1= AJ |authorlink1= |title= The Biological Foundations of Clinical Psychiatry |url=  |year= 1986 |publisher= Medical Examination Publishing Company |location= New Hyde Park, NY |isbn= 978-0-87488-449-4 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 193–198 |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier assessment of the person may present with elevated levels of thyroglobulin owing to transient [[thyrotoxicosis]], as inflammation within the thyroid causes damage to the integrity of thyroid follicle storage of thyroglobulin; TSH secretion from the anterior pituitary increases in response to a decrease in negative feedback inhibition secondary to decreased serum thyroid hormones. Typically T4 is the preferred thyroid hormone test for hypothyroidism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/120937-workup#c8|title=Hashimoto Thyroiditis Workup: Approach Considerations, Serum TSH Test and Other Studies, Ultrasonography|website=emedicine.medscape.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exposure of the body to substantial amounts of previously isolated thyroid enzymes is thought to contribute to the exacerbation of tolerance breakdown, giving rise to the more pronounced symptoms seen later in the disease. Lymphocytic infiltration of the [[thyrocyte]]-associated tissues often leads to the histologically significant finding of [[germinal center]] development within the thyroid gland.

Hashimoto's when presenting as mania is known as Prasad's syndrome after Ashok Prasad, the psychiatrist who first described it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prasad's syndrome|format=PDF|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/152/3/438b?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=weiner+kennedy&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609130718/http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/152/3/438b?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=weiner+kennedy&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT|archivedate=9 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

===Managing hormone levels===
[[Hypothyroidism]] caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis is treated with thyroid hormone replacement agents such as [[levothyroxine]], [[triiodothyronine]] or [[desiccated thyroid extract]]. A tablet taken once a day generally keeps the thyroid hormone levels normal. In most cases, the treatment needs to be taken for the rest of the person's life. In the event that hypothyroidism is caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis, it may be recommended that the TSH levels be kept under 3.0 m[[International unit|IU]]/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does Your Doctor Know About the New TSH Lab Standards?|url=http://thyroid.about.com/cs/testsforthyroid/a/labs2003.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204102459/http://thyroid.about.com/cs/testsforthyroid/a/labs2003.htm|archivedate=4 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Overt, symptomatic thyroid dysfunction is the most common complication, with about 5% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism and chronic [[autoimmune thyroiditis]] progressing to thyroid failure every year. Transient periods of thyrotoxicosis (over-activity of the thyroid) sometimes occur, and rarely the illness may progress to full hyperthyroid [[Graves' disease]] with active [[Graves' ophthalmopathy|orbitopathy]] (bulging, inflamed eyes). Rare cases of fibrous autoimmune thyroiditis present with severe [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath) and [[dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing), resembling aggressive thyroid tumors – but such symptoms always improve with surgery or [[corticosteroid]] therapy. Primary thyroid [[B cell lymphoma]] affects fewer than one in a thousand persons, and it is more likely to affect those with long-standing autoimmune thyroiditis.&lt;ref name=Monaco/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
This disorder is believed to be the most common cause of primary [[hypothyroidism]] in [[North America]]; as a cause of non-endemic goiter, it is among the most common.&lt;ref name="Kumar2010a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Mechanisms of Disease|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|edition=8th|pages=1111–205|chapter=24: The Endocrine System}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hashimoto's thyroiditis affects about 5% of the population at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Py2015/&gt; About 1 to 1.5 in 1000 people have this disease at any point in time.&lt;ref name="Kumar2010a" /&gt; It occurs between eight and fifteen times more often in women than in men. Though it may occur at any age, including in children, it is most often observed in women between 30 and 60 years of age.&lt;ref name=Monaco /&gt; It is more common in regions of high iodine dietary intake, and among people who are genetically susceptible.&lt;ref name=Monaco&gt;{{cite book|title = Thyroid Diseases | author = Fabrizio Monaco | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781439868393 | page = 78 | publisher = Taylor and Francis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Also known as Hashimoto's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is named after the Japanese physician [[Hakaru Hashimoto]] (1881−1934) of the medical school at [[Kyushu University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|1974|Hakaru Hashimoto}}&lt;/ref&gt; who first described the symptoms of persons with ''struma lymphomatosa'', an intense infiltration of lymphocytes within the thyroid, in 1912 in a German publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Hashimoto |title=Zur Kenntnis der lymphomatösen Veränderung der Schilddrüse (Struma lymphomatosa)  |language=de|journal=Archiv für Klinische Chirurgie |year=1912 |volume=97 |pages=219–248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report gave new insight into a condition (hypothyroidism) more commonly seen in areas of iodine deficiency that was occurring in the developed world, and without evident causation by dietary deficiency.

In 1957 it was recognized as an autoimmune disorder and was the first organ-specific one identified.&lt;ref name=Mo2009/&gt;

== Pregnancy ==
Pregnant women who are positive for Hashimoto's thyroiditis may have decreased thyroid function or the gland may fail entirely.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reduction of Miscarriages through Universal Screening and Treatment of Thyroid Autoimmune Diseases|journal = Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation|date = 2012-01-01|volume = 74|issue = 4|doi = 10.1159/000343759|pmid = 23147711|first = Thibault|last = Lepoutre|first2 = Frederic|last2 = Debiève|first3 = Damien|last3 = Gruson|first4 = Chantal|last4 = Daumerie|pages = 265–273|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a woman is TPOAb-positive, clinicians can inform her of the risks for themselves and their infants if they go untreated.

==Healthcare==
There is free access to primary healthcare for all citizens but to access tertiary health services people travel to Kenya or South Africa and pay. There are specialized services on [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]]. There are some small private medical clinics on Mahé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seychelles Health Insurance |url=https://www.pacificprime.com/country/africa/seychelles-health-insurance/ |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=Pacific Prime |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 there was about one doctor per 780 people and one nurse for 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WHO report on Seychelles gives thumbs-up on free health care |url=http://www.seychellesnewsagency.com/articles/399/WHO+report+on+Seychelles+gives+thumbs-up+on+free+health+care |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=Seychelles News |date=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2009 the [[Ukrainian government]] planned on reforming the health care system, by the creation of a national network of [[family doctor]]s and improvements in the [[Emergency medical services|medical emergency services]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/11044/ National network of family doctors to be established by 2010, says health minister], [[Interfax|Interfax-Ukraine]] (March 30, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukrainian Prime Minister]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] wanted (in November 2009) to start introducing a public healthcare system based on health insurance in the spring of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/53483/ Ukraine to start introducing insurance-based healthcare system in spring of 2010], [[Kyiv Post]] (November 24, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further reform was promised by Health Minister [[Alexander Kvitashvili]] in 2014 but proposals failed to make political progress and he offered his resignation - which was not accepted.  State funding for hospitals cover only the electricity and meager staff salaries, leading to widespread bribery. Even hot water is a problem.  Charitable donations are needed to buy even basic medicines or fuel needed to visit patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukraine health system in danger of collapse as reforms stall|url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0U60LN20151223|accessdate=5 October 2015|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6960">The '''illegal drug trade in Guatemala''' includes trans-shipment of [[cocaine]] to the United States. According to some reports, Mexican drug cartels such as [[Sinaloa Cartel|Sinaloa]] have also established [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] growing operations there. There is a reported relationship between the Mexican [[Los Zetas]] cartel and the Guatemalan [[Kaibiles]] military force. 

== Effectual Characteristics ==

==== Outside Support ====
Guatemala has become one of the larger drug smuggling countries in Latin America precisely because drug cartels in neighboring states have offered their support. Cartels in Colombia have sent upwards of 48 tons worth of cocaine to Guatemala and the cartels have shared techniques for moving cocaine unnoticed, such as mixing cocaine with fruit pulp.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Reuter, Gordon Crawford, and Jonathan Cave, ''Sealing the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in Drug Interdiction'' (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 1988), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Mexican cartels have actively cooperated with Guatemalan drug dealers because Mexico has become the primary destination for smuggled drugs. This relationship has encompassed most major drugs, including the selling of raw opium gum and, eventually, the processed poppy, which carries a higher price per kilo for Guatemalan growers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bunck, J., &amp; Fowler, M. (2012). Bribes, Bullets, and Intimidation: Drug Trafficking and the Law in Central America.University Park, Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Belizean support has allowed inhabitants in Guatemala to start growing marijuana as well, which has become popular for both consumption and smuggling to Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Domestic Policing ====
Within Guatemala, the domestic police has experienced difficulty combating the growing and selling of drugs and combating the inefficiency and corruption in the police force. In the 1980s, there was a low police officer to citizen ratio and the state poorly trained police officers and offered low wages, which contributed to low morale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Consequently, bribes became a common method for circumventing anti-drug police efforts and countering successful arrests.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, ''International Narcotics Control Strategy Report'' (2002), V-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, police forces in many areas were involved with the drug cartels, offering assistance, making money, and acquiring additional local power and influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/LAP_single_page.pdf|title=Organized Crime in Latin America: The Northern Triangle|last=|first=|date=|website=Wilson Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low quality of policing and different forms of corruption lead to low public support and faith in the ability of the police and has led to the public’s unwillingness to cooperate and decision to start lynch mobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Geography ====
Geography in Guatemala has created both an ideal climate for growing drugs and divided regions for smuggling drugs.  The vast amounts of mountains and forests that divide the country make governing and policing more difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the mountains located in the provinces of San Marcos and Huehuetenango, inhabitants are able to grow different types of drugs, primarily opium.&lt;ref&gt;Celerino Castillo and Dave Harmon, ''Powderburns: Cocaine, Contras &amp; the Drug War'' (Oakville: Mosaic Press, 1994), 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these provinces are along the northern border of Guatemala which connects the opium fields to Mexico, the primary destination of the majority of drugs that are grown or smuggled through Guatemala. Due to the close proximity with Mexico, Guatemalan and Mexican police have experienced difficulty combating the fields as the two governments must respect the other’s sovereign borders and do not have complete authority in the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The northern forests in Guatemala have allowed marijuana growers and smugglers to maneuver away from authorities as well. Through the support of growers in Belize, people in Guatemala were able to acquire seeds and connections to start growing and exporting their product to Mexico, while avoiding the more restrictive laws and effort by the government in Belize.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Dynamics ==
[[Guatemala]] connects [[Honduras]] and [[Mexico]] along common drug routes between Central America and the United States. Its long, unpatrolled coastline and sparse jungles make it a popular landing point for boats and planes carrying drugs from South America, while its borders are understaffed and ill-equipped to fully exert customs controls.&lt;ref name=icgrpt/&gt;

"According to a December 2008 report from the U.S. National Drug Intelligence Center, less than 1 percent of the estimated 600 to 700 tons of cocaine that departed South America for the United States in 2007 transited Central America. The rest, for the most part, passed through the Caribbean Sea or Pacific Ocean en route to Mexico. Since then, land-based shipment of cocaine through Central America appears to have ballooned. Earlier this month, U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala Stephen McFarland estimated in an interview with a Guatemalan newspaper that cocaine now passes through that country at a rate of approximately 300 to 400 tons per year."&lt;ref name=stratfor&gt;Stratfor, 26 March 2009, [http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20090326_central_america_emerging_role_drug_trade Central America: An Emerging Role in the Drug Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Crisis Group]], “the presence of Mexican cartels fighting on Guatemalan territory demonstrated how important and competitive the eastern region had become for the transnational cocaine trade”.&lt;ref name=icgrpt&gt;International Crisis Group. "[http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/latin-america-caribbean/guatemala/052-corridor-of-violence-the-guatemala-honduras-border.aspx Corridor of Violence: The Guatemala-Honduras Border]". [http://www.crisisgroup.org CrisisGroup.org]. 4 June 2014. Retrieved 29 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 [[STRATFOR]] report corroborates: "Mexican drug traffickers appear to operate much more extensively than in any other Central American country; this may be due, at least in part, to the relationship between Los Zetas and the Guatemalan Kaibiles. Beyond the apparently more-established Zeta smuggling operations there, several recent drug seizures — including an enormous 1,800-acre poppy plantation attributed to the Sinaloa cartel — make it clear that other Mexican drug-trafficking organizations are currently active inside Guatemala."&lt;ref name=stratfor/&gt;

The '''Institute of Tropical Medicine''' ({{lang-fr|Institut de médecine tropicale}}) previously known as '''Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine''' is located in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]. ITM is one of the world's leading institutes for training and research in [[tropical medicine]] and the organisation of health care in developing countries. It also delivers outpatient, clinical and preventive services in tropical pathologies and sexually transmitted diseases.

The institute has a strong reputation in biomedical, clinical and public health research, advanced education, travel medicine and care for HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections, as well as capacity-building in developing countries. [[Peter Piot]] and colleagues at the institute were the first to demonstrate that AIDS was a tropical African disease. ITM has been recognized by the [[World Health Organization]] as a reference centre for [[Aids|AIDS]] research. ITM also is a national and international reference centre for a series of diseases and pathogens (such as the [[Ebola]] virus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itg.be/E|title=Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At ITM, some 450 scientists and technicians do research on pathogens, patients and populations. Yearly, an average of 500 medical doctors, nurses and scientists follow advanced courses; some 120 young researchers are completing their PhD. Each year, the medical services handle around 35 000 consultations. The website www.travelhealth.be services more than 100 000 visitors a year.

More than 75% of its publications appear in the top-25% of journals in its field. (Scimago World Ranking, 2010)

ITM also carries out an extensive capacity strengthening program in developing countries, and is part of a large network of institutions in Africa, South America and Asia.

'''James Yearsley''' (1805–1869), aural surgeon, was born in 1805 to a north-country family settled in [[Cheltenham]].

==Medical career==
Adopting a medical career, he became a pupil of Ralph Fletcher of [[Gloucester]], (a surgeon of considerable eminence in his profession, and of some note as a collector of pictures), and later married his daughter. Yearsley moved to London, where he entered himself a student at [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]]. He was admitted a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] of England and a licentiate of the [[Society of Apothecaries]] in 1827; later in life he added to these qualifications the licentiateship of the [[Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh]] (1860), and he graduated M.D. at [[St. Andrews University]] in 1862.

After practising for a short time in Cheltenham, he established himself about 1829 as a general practitioner at [[Ross, Herefordshire|Ross]] in [[Herefordshire]]. He removed to London about 1837, and started to practise as an aural surgeon. He opened an institution for the relief of diseases of the ear in Sackville Street, [[Piccadilly]], and in 1846 he became surgeon to the [[Royal Society of Musicians]].  He founded a hospital specialising in the diseases of the ear, the [[Metropolitan Ear Nose and Throat Hospital]] in [[Kensington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/metropolitanent.html Lost Hospitals of London, Metropolitan Ear Nose &amp; Throat Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yearsley deserves recognition as one who assisted in bringing aural surgery out of the degraded position it held at the beginning of the 19th century. He insisted strongly upon the connection between [[deafness]] and disease of the [[naso-pharynx]]. At first he practised freely the removal of the [[tonsils]] as an aid to recovery from deafness, but in later life experience led him to modify his views, and he performed [[tonsillectomy]] much less often. Yearsley learnt, too, the value of an artificial [[Tympanum (anatomy)|tympanum]] in the relief of certain forms of deafness, and he very justly recommended the use of the simplest form of film in preference to the more complex tympana employed by some of his contemporaries.

Yearsley was less scientific than either [[George Pilcher]] or [[Joseph Toynbee]], and, though original in his views and bold in expressing his opinions, he too often spoilt his cause by his controversial temperament.

==As a publisher==
He was the originator and proprietor of the [[Medical Circular]] from 1852 until it was consolidated with the [[Medical Press and Circular|Dublin Medical Press]] in January 1866. Jointly with two other members of his profession, Dr. Tyler Smith and Dr. [[Forbes Benignus Winslow]], he founded the ‘'[[Medical Directory]]'’, becoming its sole proprietor on the retirement of his two partners.

===Published works===
Yearsley's works were: 
# ‘Improved Methods of treating Diseases of the Ear,’ London, 1840, 12mo. 
# ‘Contributions to Aural Surgery,’ London, 1841, 12mo. 
# ‘Stammering,’ &amp;c., London, 1841, 8vo; 3rd edit. 1841. 
# ‘A Treatise on Enlarged Tonsils,’ London, 1842, 8vo; 3rd edit. 1848.
# ‘On Throat Deafness,’ London, 1853, 8vo; 2nd edit. 1868. 
# ‘Deafness Practically Illustrated,’ London, 1854, 12mo.

==Death==
Yearsley died at his house in [[Savile Row]], London, on 9 July 1869, and was buried at [[Sutton Bonnington]], in [[Nottinghamshire]].

A memorial plaque on his former clinic at [[Sackville Street (London)|32 Sackville Street]], [[Piccadilly]] was unveiled on 27 May 1994&lt;ref&gt;[http://openplaques.org/plaques/3025 Dr. James Yearsley.] Open Plaques, Plaque No. 3025, 2014. Retrieved 6 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which reads "Westminster City Council Dr. James Yearsley, MD, MRCS, LRCP, 1805 - 1869, founded the Metropolitan Ear Institute here in 1838. Mr. Ronnie Yearsley."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/dr-yearsley Plaque: Dr Yearsley.] London Remembers, 2014. Retrieved 6 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kela''', abbr. from {{lang-fi|Kansaneläkelaitos}}, {{lang-sv|Folkpensionsanstalten}} (Fpa), {{lang-en|The Social Insurance Institution}} (SII), is a [[Finland|Finnish]] government agency in charge of settling benefits under national [[Social security in Finland|social security]] programs. Kela was founded in 1937 to handle [[retirement pay]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, its role was expanded to handle other fields like [[child benefit]]s, [[unemployment benefit]]s, [[Health benefits (insurance)|sickness benefit]]s, [[health insurance]] and [[Student financial aid (Finland)|student financial aid]].

Kela is funded from compulsory payments to some of the administered schemes (24 % 2015)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kela.fi/documents/10180/1169692/Kelan_toimintakertomus_2015.pdf Toimintakertomus 2015] (Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[taxation]]. Coverage under the schemes is given to all permanent residents of Finland. ''Kansaneläkelaitos/Folkpensionsanstalten'' literally means "People's Pension Institute", reflecting its original function as the national provider of retirement benefits.

An '''MD–MS program''' is a [[dual degree]] [[graduate school]] program awarding both a [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) and a [[Master of Science]] (MS) degree. Post-graduate diploma holders and [[Diplomate of National Board]] (India) candidates can upgrade to an MD-MS degree through opportunities such as post-graduate–up-gradation programs.

== Description ==
An MD-MS Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tauedu.org/masters-in-medicine.html |title=M.D./M.S. Programs - Education - Texila American University |publisher=Tauedu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[tutor]]-based program in which students are trained by research professionals on modern innovations in the healthcare industry. The MD-MS degree is designed for people who intend to pursue clinical practice and want to develop their research skills in a related area of engineering. It is well suited for students who desire a better understanding of the types of technology they may employ as practicing physicians. The MD-MS degree program provides a funded research experience in engineering that is expected to lead to research publishing. The program also provides practice in engineering design and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/academics/graduate/mdms/ |title=M.D./M.S. Program &amp;#124; Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth |publisher=Engineering.dartmouth.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire course is developed to be mentor-based, enabling the students to be coached by experts attached to a recommended medical center. Most of the courses take place online, via distance learning, leaving professionals free to study without leaving their jobs.

=== Eligibility ===
* Candidates who have appeared and cleared the [[Diplomate of National Board|DNB]] exams 
* Doctors with a post-graduate diploma/degree can study for the PG-up-gradation program

=== Duration ===
Requirements for the combined MD and master's degrees are equivalent to those of the separate degrees of the Doctor of Medicine of the School of Medicine and the specific Master of Science degree at a particular campus. The dual degree program can usually be completed within five to six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medschool.umaryland.edu/osr/student_md_masters.asp |title=Combined MD/Master's Programs: Office of Student Research: University of Maryland School of Medicine |publisher=Medschool.umaryland.edu |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluation ===
Evaluation of the course is assessed by the guide and university through [[thesis]]/[[dissertation]] submitted by the student based on their research project done.

==Examples ==
Biomedical Informatics (BMI) applies statistical techniques and technologies to the medical and health sciences.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008&gt;{{cite web |title=MS Programs - Education - Stanford University School of Medicine |url=http://med.stanford.edu/ms/ |publisher=Med.stanford.edu |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2014-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503050513/http://med.stanford.edu/ms/ |archivedate=2014-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epidemiology involves the study of disease — and the predisposing conditions for disease — among human populations in all parts of the world, with an emphasis on approaches to improving levels of health. The MS Program in Epidemiology is presented by the Department of Health Research and Policy (HRP) at the School of Medicine.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Health Services Research (HSR) is concerned with the analysis of health policy in the public and private sectors. The MS Program in HSR is part of the Department of Health Research and Policy (HRP) at the School of Medicine.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Masters of Medicine (MOM) includes experience in clinical medicine with a view to foster translational research. Students who pursue the MS in Medicine while engaged in their doctoral programs will be highly knowledgeable about human biology and disease, and thus more able to translate scientific discoveries into useful medical advances.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Masters of Human Genetics and Genetic Counseling is a program that trains students to understand the molecular, clinical and psychological implications of differences in the human genome, and to translate these intricacies to health care professionals, laboratory researchers and patients/families. Graduates of this program will be eligible for board certification by the American Board of Genetic Counselling.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

The Master of Sciences of Pharmacy (MPharm) is the standard master's degree program in Pharmacy. It is the oldest honourable Diploma (Degree) authorized from the European Faculties of Pharmacy as it takes four years to complete. It is based on a credit system higher than the normal Bachelor of Pharmacy degree (BPharm) and the American Pharmaceutical Diploma, Doctor of Pharmacy,(PharmD). The Faculty is a member of the Association of European Faculties of Pharmacy and its graduates meet all the requirements for the profession as defined by the European Union. In the initial three years students revise and broaden their knowledge of elementary natural and medical subjects to the level required for understanding specific subjects from the field of Pharmacy. Students attend lectures and seminars and take part in practical pharmacy placements. During the last year of study they work on their thesis. The programme is concluded by defending the thesis and taking the final state examination. Then the students are awarded the master's degree (abbreviated Mgr.). The study programme is compliant with EU directive 2005/36/EC.
Graduates awarded the master's degree can later sit for a thorough state exam including an advanced thesis defence. After passing they are awarded the "Testing Board" degree (abbreviated EPhB).
Graduates can apply for postgraduate after studying several branches of Pharmacy in the five accredited years. After defending their dissertation, submit their researches in their selected branches of Pharmacy and passing the final state examination they are awarded the Ph.D. degree.
The Faculty closely cooperates with industry and runs a Faculty Pharmacy on the premises. It cooperates with private and public pharmacies in the country where students conduct their placements and also with the Chamber of Pharmacists and the Association of Pharmacy owners.

== Finland ==

In [[Finland]], ''proviisori'' is an [[academic degree]] awarded after completing the post graduate programme in pharmacy. The degree is equivalent to English term ''Master of Pharmacy''. Proviisori degree is required in order to be a druggist in Finland. Pharmacy is taught in [[University of Helsinki]] and [[University of Eastern Finland]].

== Malta ==
The [[University of Malta]], Department of Pharmacy within the Faculty of Medicine &amp; Surgery, offers a Master of Pharmacy (M.Pharm.) course for students who have successfully completed the Bachelor of Science (Hons.) in Pharmaceutical Science. The M.Pharm is a requirement in obtaining the warrant to practice as a Pharmacist in [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/ms/pharmacy|title=Pharmacy - Pharmacy - University of Malta|website=www.um.edu.mt|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], MPharm is an [[undergraduate]] [[academic degree]] awarded following four years academic study in pharmacy. The degree is awarded by all of the schools of pharmacy in the UK and superseded the BSc (Pharmacy) or [[BPharm]] degree when the length of the undergraduate pharmacy course was increased from three to four years in 1997—partly due to EU harmonisation of pharmacy training and partly to extend the scope of the undergraduate degree.

The MPharm is the only qualification in the UK which leads to professional registration as a pharmacist. MPharm programs are accredited by the [[General Pharmaceutical Council]] (GPhC) in England, Scotland and Wales, and [[Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) in Northern Ireland.
Aspiring pharmacists in the UK qualify by first completing this degree, then undertaking a year of pre-registration training. On successful completion of this training, and after passing the pre-registration exam, they become registered pharmacists. In [[Great Britain]] it used to be the case, until September 2010, that with registration they became members of the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]], able to use the postnominal letters ''MRPharmS'' (Member of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain). However, the RPS split off its regulatory role in September 2010 and the new regulatory body, the GPhC, does not grant postnominals to its registrants.  MRPharmS is still granted by the RPS to its member but no longer has an automatic link to current registration as a pharmacist.  In Northern Ireland regulation has not been removed from the PSNI and therefore registration as a pharmacist and membership of the PSNI are still simultaneous, granting use of the postnominals ''MPSNI'' (Member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland).

===Universities===
&lt;ref name="Gerens Curnow"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accredited MPharm degrees|url=https://www.pharmacyregulation.org/education/pharmacist/accredited-mpharm-degrees|website=General Pharmaceutical Council|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== India / Australia==
Master of Pharmacy (MPharma) in India is offered as post graduate (graduate) course after completion of [[BPharma]] degree. The MPharma course is normally of two years duration.In some universities it is one-year research and one year theory examination, while some offers M Pharm by research completely leading to doctorate degree. The course focuses on specialisation in the field of pharmacy. The MPharma courses are offered by pharmacy colleges affiliated to uniee leading to entry into the pharmacy profession. In 2004, the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] introduced a two-year postgraduate MPharm coursework program, to provide an alternative means to gain qualification for registration to practice as a pharmacist for graduates with a bachelor's degree in any science or medical science that includes the required prerequisites. The MPharm degree is not an advanced follow-up degree for pharmacists. Following the commencement of the MPharm program at the University of Newcastle, other universities across Australia also began offering MPharm coursework programs. At present, either the BPharm or MPharm degree is accepted for registration as a practicing pharmacist.

See [[List of pharmacy schools#Australia|list of pharmacy schools: Australia]] for a listing of institutions offering the MPharm degree.

===MPharm (Clinical)/MClinPharm===

With the success and popularity of the MPharm coursework degrees, research MPharm degrees have now been redesignated '''Master of Pharmacy (Clinical)''' (abbreviated '''MPharm (Clinical)''') or  '''Master of Clinical Pharmacy''' (abbreviated '''MClinPharm'''). This degree offers advanced training to graduates of a Bachelor of Pharmacy, and does not by itself meet the requirements for registration as a pharmacist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6316">{{economic history of Chile}}
The '''Meat riot''' (Spanish: ''Huelga de la carne''), in the [[Chile]]an capital [[Santiago]] in October 1905, was a violent riot that originated from a [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] against the tariffs applied to the [[Argentine beef|cattle imports from Argentina]].&lt;ref name=mem&gt;{{es icon}} ''[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/dest.asp?id=movimientoshuelgadelacarne Primeros movimientos sociales chileno (1890-1920)]''. Memoria Chilena.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=benjamin&gt;Benjamin S. 1997. Meat and Strength: The Moral Economy of a Chilean Food Riot. ''[[Cultural Anthropology]]'', 12, pp. 234-268.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
The establishment of the [[Rail transport in Argentina|Buenos Aires-Mendoza railroad]] in 1885 ended the lengthy and costly trade with [[cart]]s that connected these two regions of Argentina and facilitated cattle exports from the [[pampas]] to Chile, albeit in the last portion of the route the cattle had to walk over the high [[mountain pass]]es of the [[Andes]].&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lacoste&gt;{{es icon}} Lacoste, Pablo. 2004. [http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-23762004000200005&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=es La vid y el vino en América del Sur: el desplazamiento de los polos vitivinícolas (siglos XVI al XX)], ''[[Revista Universum]]'', 19, p. 62-93.&lt;/ref&gt; These imports resulted in a lowering of meat prices in Chile.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt;

In 1887 ''[[Sociedad Nacional de la Agricultura]]'' (National Agriculture Society), a landowners organization, proposed to put a tariff on the Argentine cattle that Chile was importing from Argentina.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; In 1888 the attempt to pass this as a law in the [[Chilean Congress|Chamber of Deputies]] was frustrated by several urban workers social organizations, the [[Democrat Party (Chile)|Democrat Party]], and [[mining in Chile|mine owners]] that protested against it.&lt;ref name=revista/&gt;&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt;

''Sociedad Nacional de la Agricultura'' continued to support the implementation of a tariff and in 1897 it was passed as a law in congress, principally as part of a [[protectionism|protectionist]] law package.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; The package was supported by the Democrat Party, but in 1898 and 1899 it called for the abolition of the tariff returning to its old stance.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; In 1902 a series of demonstrations against the tariff took place.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; Scholar Benjamin  S. Orlove suggest that it was the rise of staple food prices that led to renewed protests against the tariff in 1905. This would have been because high staple prices would have led people to have less money available for buying meat.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; The prices of meat themselves remained stable in the period preceding the Meat riots.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt;

==Demonstration==
In September 1905, members of the [[Democrat Party (Chile)|Democrat Party]] and several [[Benefit society|mutual aid societies]] of Santiago met to form an umbrella organization named ''Comité Central de Abolición del Impuesto al Ganado'' (Central Committee for the Abolishment of the Livestock Tariff).&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; The new organisation called for a demonstration on Sunday October 22.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; State authorities approved a demonstration route.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; The plans for the demonstration spread through word of mouth and support from the [[political center|centrist]] Catholic newspaper ''[[El Chileno]]''.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt;

At the place and time of meeting in Santiago on Sunday, it has been estimated that fifty thousand people gathered.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; Another estimate puts the number at twelve thousand of which at least 6000 belonged to the [[working class]].&lt;ref name=revista&gt;{{es icon}} 2006. [http://www.estudioshistoricos.uchile.cl/CDA/est_hist_simple/0,1474,SCID%253D18812%2526ISID%253D650%2526PRT%253D18809,00.html Una Mirada al Movimiento Popular Desde dos Asonadas Callejeras (Santiago, 1888-1905). III. La “Huelga de la Carne”.], [[Revista de Estudios Históricos]].&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that Santiago at the time had 320 000 inhabitants, the demonstration was huge.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; Apart from those that gathered in Santiago demonstrations were held all over Chile.&lt;ref name=revista/&gt;

From the meeting point at [[Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins|La Alameda]], a demonstration group that included ten neighborhood associations plus 41 trade unions and mutual aid societies marched to [[Palacio de La Moneda]] where they planned to deliver a petition to president [[Germán Riesco]].&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt;

==Red Week==
Upon arrival to La Moneda it was found that president Germán Riesco was not there. A minor group of protesters were told by government representative that the president was at his residence a few blocks away.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; This minority group marched to the residence where protest leaders were allowed to enter to deliver the petition document and to chat with the president.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; The chat went over to lengthy discussions. Meanwhile, the majority of the protesters were unaware of the meeting and thought that the president had turned his back on them by refusing a meeting. A rumour saying that the president had left Santiago spread.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt; In this atmosphere violence erupted. Demonstrators attacked "buildings and public structure" and police attacked the demonstrators.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt;

Police stations, private residences, telegraph and telephone lines were attacked and stores were pillaged.&lt;ref name=benjamin/&gt;&lt;ref name=revista/&gt; At 4-5 o'clock most workers retired from the city centre.&lt;ref name=revista/&gt; By the same time the looting intensified.&lt;ref name=revista/&gt;

==[[Philippine Physician Licensure Examination]]==
The licensure exams for physicians (board exam for doctors) are administered by the '''Philippine Board of Medicine''', a professional regulatory body under the general control and supervision of the [[Professional Regulation Commission]] (PRC) of the Philippines.&lt;ref name="board"/&gt;

==Advanced medical studies==
After graduation from medical school and passing the board exam for doctors, a Filipino doctor is labelled as a ''general medical practitioner''. He may seek further training by way of graduate programs in medicine (i.e., Master of Public Health, Master of Health Services Administration, etc.), or by way of medical specialization.&lt;ref name="board"/&gt;

===Graduate medical programs===
Graduate programs are offered in some [[medical school]]s in the country and abroad. Candidates usually attend lectures and practical exercises in an academic environment and in laboratory settings. The program may require the presentation and defense of a graduate-level thesis, an independent research project, or supervised professional practice as a final graduation requirement. The entire academic program may last from one year to five years, depending on the requirements of the curriculum; the demands of the institution; and the academic load, availability, and dedication of the individual student.&lt;ref name="board"/&gt;

===Medical specialization===
Medical specialization usually takes three to six years of residency training in accredited hospitals and clinics, and the taking of diplomate board examinations conducted by a board of medical specialists in a particular field (i.e., Philippine Board of Psychiatry, Philippine Board of Pediatrics, Philippine Board of Surgery, Philippine Specialty Board of Internal Medicine, Philippine Academy of Family Physicians Board of Examiners etc.).
After specialization, the doctor may practice his field of specialty or pursue one to three years of subspecialty training / fellowship such as
A) Pediatrics and internal medicine: cardiology, pulmonology, gastroenterology, endocrinology, infectious disease, oncology etc.
B) Surgery: thoracic and cardiovascular, pediatric, transplant, trauma, minimally invasive, oncology
C) Anesthesiology: pain, cardiovascular
D) OB Gyn: oncology, ultrasound, reproductive endocrinology and infertility
Straight programs for subspecialties are also offered : urology, orthopedics, plastic and reconstructive, neurosurgery
&lt;ref name="board"/&gt;

==Medical practice==
Medical practice in the Philippines is developed, monitored, and regulated by the '''[[Philippine Medical Association]]''' (PMA), the largest organization of medical doctors in the country. Other medical and health societies co-exist to pursue more specific interests in the medical field (i.e. [http://www.thepafp.org/ Philippine Academy of Family Physicians], Philippine Dermatological Society, Philippine Cancer Society, Philippine Pediatric Society, Philippine Association for the Study of Overweight and Obesity, etc.).&lt;ref name=assoc&gt;Allied organizations, Philippine Medical Association, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]]''', a cabinet-level department under the Office of the President of the Philippines, exercises general monitoring supervisory powers over medical practitioners and allied health personnel in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Public Information Office, Department of Health, Republic of the Philippines, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Filipino doctors==
*[[José Rizal]] - the National Hero of the Philippines
*[[Mariano Ponce]] - Filipino propagandist, was managing editor of La Solidaridad
*[[Jose Fabella]] - first Health Secretary
*[[Juan Flavier]] - former Health Secretary and Senator of the Philippines
*Ramon Gustilo - Orthopedic surgeon; responsible for the commonly used [[Gustilo open fracture classification]].
*[[Fe del Mundo]] - First Filipino woman and female medical student to enter the Harvard Medical School. A pioneer of [[Pediatrics]] in the Philippines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14426">In 1767, the 11-year-old composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was struck by [[smallpox]]. Like all smallpox victims, he was at serious risk of dying, but he survived the disease. This article discusses smallpox as it existed in Mozart's time, the decision taken in 1764 by Mozart's father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] not to inoculate his children against the disease, the course of Mozart's illness, and the aftermath.

==Smallpox in Mozart's day==
{{Main|Smallpox|History of smallpox}}
Smallpox in 18th-century Europe was a devastating disease, recurring in frequent epidemics and killing or disfiguring millions of people. The 18th century was probably a particularly terrible time for smallpox in Europe: urbanization had increased crowding, making it easier for the disease to spread;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins (2002, 62)&lt;/ref&gt; yet effective protection from smallpox through a [[smallpox vaccine]] was discovered only at the end of the century (see below).

The disease was a terrible one for its victims. Ian and Jenifer Glynn write:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So what was it like? As children, we were told it was like [[chickenpox]] but worse. In fact it is not related to chickenpox, and it was unimaginably worse. In an unvaccinated population, something like 10–30 percent of all patients with smallpox would be expected to die. And dying was not easy; smallpox was, as [[Thomas Macaulay|Macaulay]] wrote, 'the most terrible of all the ministers of death.'&lt;ref&gt;Glynn and Glynn (2008, 2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those who survived smallpox did not always survive intact; it frequently inflicted blindness on its survivors. The survival rate was particularly low for children.

The physical appearance of the disease was frightening to patients and to their caretakers: the patient's skin became covered with large, bulging pustules, which often left conspicuous pitting on the skin of patients who survived the disease.

==Leopold's decision against inoculation==
Medicine had made only slight progress against the disease in Mozart's time. Around the second decade of the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 70)&lt;/ref&gt; the method of [[inoculation]], which had originated in Asia, reached European countries. Inoculation was not the same as the [[vaccination]] which later succeeded in eradicating the disease; rather, an inoculated person was treated with live smallpox virus, taken from pustules of the mildest variety of smallpox that could be found.

Inoculation offered immunity to smallpox, but the procedure carried a definite risk that the inoculated person could die from smallpox as a result. Thus, many parents felt that they would rather do nothing, risking future smallpox arriving at random, rather than carry out a deliberate act that might well kill their children immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 71–72)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Mozart biographer [[Ruth Halliwell]] points out, it is in this context that we must interpret a letter sent by Leopold Mozart on 22 February 1764 to his landlord and friend [[Lorenz Hagenauer]] concerning smallpox:
&lt;blockquote&gt;They are trying to persuade me to let my boy be inoculated with smallpox. But as I have expressed sufficiently clearly my aversion to this impertinence they are leaving me in peace. Here inoculation is the general fashion. But for my part I leave the matter to the grace of God. It depends on His grace whether He wishes to keep this prodigy of nature in this world in which He placed it or to take it to Himself.&lt;ref&gt;Translation from Jenkins (1995, 410), who cites Anderson (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the modern perspective—with most children now made safe from several terrible diseases by vaccination—it is easy to make the superficial interpretation that Leopold was acting foolishly, relying on divine will when direct action was available that would have helped his children. However, since in Leopold's day it was not firmly established that inoculation was beneficial,&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins (2002, 62) observes that inoculation was a very controversial practice in Paris at the very time of the Mozarts' visit. The visiting Italian physician Angelo Gatti noted in 1761 that in Paris there were "more brochures for and against inoculation than inoculations."&lt;/ref&gt; his remarks can be seen to be more of appeal to religion to resolve what must have seemed an impossible dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;The primary source for this section is Halliwell (1998, 70–72), which discusses Leopold's dilemma in greater detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mozart's case of smallpox==
The Mozart family (Wolfgang, his father Leopold, his mother [[Anna Maria Mozart|Anna Maria]], and his older sister [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]) left their home in [[Salzburg]] for [[Vienna]] on 11 September, 1767.&lt;ref name=H120&gt;Halliwell (1998, 120)&lt;/ref&gt; They had been there before, exhibiting the children's talents, in 1762;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon (1995, 40–42)&lt;/ref&gt; by this time they had completed their "[[Mozart family grand tour|Grand Tour]]" of Europe, performing in England, France, and elsewhere, and hoped to achieve even greater recognition (and income) in the Imperial capital. The forthcoming marriage of the 16-year-old [[Archduchess Maria Josepha]], daughter of Empress [[Maria Theresa]], scheduled for October 14, promised many festivities and thus opportunities for visiting musicians.&lt;ref name=H120 /&gt;

[[File:Martin van Meytens 002.jpg|thumb|Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria]]Unfortunately, there was an outbreak of smallpox in Vienna at the time. On 28 May of that year, Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] had lost his second wife [[Maria Josepha of Bavaria|Maria Josepha]] to the disease, and his mother Maria Theresa also caught it (she survived).&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 122)&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial bride-to-be Maria Josepha caught the disease in October and died of it on the 15th, the day after she had been scheduled to be married.&lt;ref name=H120 /&gt;

The Mozarts were renting rooms in the home of the goldsmith Johann Schmalecker,&lt;ref&gt;The address was at #3 Weihburggasse; the building no longer exists. Source: Deutsch (1965, 77).&lt;/ref&gt; and were horrified when all three of Schmalecker's children came down with smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 123)&lt;/ref&gt; Alarmed, Leopold first left Schmalacker's house, taking Wolfgang (only) with him (17 October).&lt;ref&gt;The implication that Leopold valued Wolfgang's survival over Nannerl's is not necessarily correct; according to Sadie and Zaslaw (2006, 132), the parents "suspected, wrongly, that Nannerl had already had smallpox as a child and so was in less danger"; see also Halliwell (1998, 125)&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later (23 October), the entire family fled the city.&lt;ref name=H120 /&gt;

They headed north, into what today is the [[Czech Republic]], first reaching [[Brno]] (then called by its German name, Brünn), where they called on the Count Franz Anton Schrattenbach, brother of Leopold's employer in Salzburg, the Prince-Archbishop [[Sigismund von Schrattenbach]]. Count Schrattenbach invited them to give a concert, but Leopold, impelled by an "inner urge," wanted to go farther, and the family continued northward after two days&lt;ref name=D77&gt;Deutsch (1965, 77)&lt;/ref&gt; to Olmütz (today [[Olomouc]]). It was there that, on 26 October, Wolfgang showed the first symptoms of smallpox. Given the incubation period of the disease (roughly, 12 days), it can be ascertained that he had already caught it in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins (2002, 63)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source for this paragraph except where indicated: Halliwell (1998, 124)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leopold consulted an acquaintance, Count Leopold Anton Podstatsky, who was dean of the Cathedral and rector of the [[Palacký University of Olomouc|University in Olmütz]].&lt;ref name=D77 /&gt; Leopold had known Podstatsky when the Count had previously worked in Salzburg. The count, learning that Wolfgang was showing symptoms of smallpox, insisted that the Mozarts move into his home, and he placed Mozart under the excellent care of his personal physician, Dr. Joseph Wolff.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 124–125); Deutsch (1965, 77)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leopold later wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Wolfgang was complaining of his eyes. I noticed his head was warm, that his cheeks were hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse was not right. So we gave him some black powder&lt;ref&gt;"The black powders were ''pulvis epilecticus niger''; they had the effect of reducing fever, and were a staple of the Mozarts' medicine chest"; Halliwell (1998, 294).&lt;/ref&gt; and put him to bed. During the night he was rather restless and in the morning he still had the dry fever.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 10 November, 1767; quoted from Solomon (1995, 70).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A frightening symptom of Wolfgang's illness, not made explicit in Leopold's letter, was an inability to see. In a letter written much later (1800), his sister Nannerl reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He caught the smallpox, which made him so ill that he could see nothing for nine days and had to spare his eyes for several weeks after his recovery.&lt;ref name=S70&gt;Quoted from Solomon (1995, 70)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although blindness was indeed a common result of smallpox, ophthalmologist Richard H. C. Zegers suggests that Mozart's symptoms did not represent actual blindness, but rather resulted from the pustular rash of the disease affecting his eyelids.&lt;ref&gt;Zegers (2007, 372)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 10 November, Wolfgang was feeling better, but then Nannerl also contracted smallpox, and was ill for three weeks.&lt;ref name=S70 /&gt; The Mozart children were thereafter safe from the disease, which confers immunity on its survivors. According to Leopold, both children were pitted in the locations of the former pustules, but neither seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins (2002, 63), Gutman (2000, 233)&lt;/ref&gt;

During his recovery, Wolfgang, who needed to spare his eyes, spent the time learning card tricks and [[fencing]].&lt;ref&gt;Gutman (2000, 233)&lt;/ref&gt;

With both children's illness to contend with, the Mozarts spent a total of four months away from Vienna.&lt;ref name=S70 /&gt; They eventually returned there and were received in the Imperial court on 19 January, 1768. The Empress, who had by now lost three children to smallpox, conversed with Frau Mozart about the disease.

The remainder of the trip was not especially successful.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see Solomon (1995, 73–74)&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold apparently misinterpreted a chance remark of the Emperor as a firm invitation for Wolfgang to compose an opera; this resulted in Wolfgang writing ''[[La finta semplice]]''. However, the opera went unperformed in Vienna; the singers and musicians did not like it, and intrigues prevented the work from reaching the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon (1995, 71)&lt;/ref&gt; ''La finta semplice'' eventually was premiered in Salzburg,&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch (1965, 89)&lt;/ref&gt; following the Mozarts' return there on 5 January 1769.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch (1965, 86)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
{{see also|Smallpox#Eradication}}
The experience of losing three of her children to smallpox led Empress Maria Theresa to become a convert to inoculation. In 1768 she engaged the Dutch physician [[Jan Ingenhousz]] to conduct an inoculation program. Ingenhousz's program worked first among poor people, with the goal of developing a weakened strain of the disease; poor parents in Vienna were paid a ducat to have their children inoculated. The inoculations performed with this weakened strain on the imperial family were successful, and led to greater public acceptance for the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 126), Glynn and Glynn (2004, 82–83)&lt;/ref&gt;

Smallpox struck the Mozart family again in the next generation: Nannerl's eldest son Leopold and two of her stepchildren caught the disease during an outbreak in the Salzburg area in 1787. All three children survived.&lt;ref name=H573&gt;Halliwell (1998, 573)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1796, the discovery of vaccination—the use of the related [[cowpox]] virus to immunize against smallpox—by [[Edward Jenner]] revolutionized the ability of medicine to deal with smallpox. Vaccination reached Vienna around 1800, when yet another local epidemic created impetus for its adoption. One of the doctors trained in the Vienna campaign, named Doutrepout, then brought vaccination to Mozart's native city of Salzburg. According to Halliwell, "popular resistance was fierce," and both the government and the Roman Catholic Church (previously an opponent) took stern measures to promote vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 617)&lt;/ref&gt; The first relative of Mozart's known to have been vaccinated was Johanna Berchtold von Sonnenberg, called "Jeannette" (1789–1805), Nannerl's youngest child;&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 685)&lt;/ref&gt; she was vaccinated during the 1802 campaign in Salzburg.&lt;ref name=H573 /&gt;

With vaccination, great progress was made in reducing incidence of the disease, and it was eventually confirmed as eradicated in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Health Organization]]: [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/ Factsheet Smallpox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921235036/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/ |date=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ognyanovo reservoir''', also called '''Lake Ognyanovo''', or '''Ognyanova''', is a reservoir in [[Bulgaria]] near Sofia. Holding 32 million cubic metres of water, it is an important [[List of dams and reservoirs in Bulgaria|reservoir in Bulgaria]]. It impounds the waters of the Lesnovska river.

On October 27, 2011, while the second-unit stunt team was filming a stuntman (Kun Liu) was killed and another (Nuo Sun), was critically injured in a staged explosion on a rubber boat. Sun underwent a five-hour operation, which left him in stable condition.&lt;ref name="FilmingAcc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/2011/10/28/1189640_expendables-2-stuntman-killed-on-ognyanovo-dam |title=Expendables 2 stuntman killed on Ognyanovo dam |publisher=Sofia Echo Media |work=The Sofia Echo |date=October 28, 2011 |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BWJHhb3s?url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/2011/10/28/1189640_expendables-2-stuntman-killed-on-ognyanovo-dam |archivedate=October 19, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmingAcc2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/10/stuntman-dies-during-the-filming-of-the-expendables-2/ |title=UPDATE: Stuntmen In ‘Expendables 2′ Fatal Accident Identified |publisher=PMC |work=Deadline.com |date=October 31, 2011 |accessdate=October 31, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BWJN8cD2?url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/10/stuntman-dies-during-the-filming-of-the-expendables-2/ |archivedate=October 19, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of foods were tested using this method, with certain [[spice]]s, [[berries]] and [[legume]]s rated highly in extensive tables once published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA). Alternative measurements include the [[Folin-Ciocalteu reagent]], and the [[Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity]] assay.

==Method==
The [[assay]] measures the oxidative degradation of the fluorescent molecule (either beta-phycoerythrin or [[fluorescein]]) after being mixed with free radical generators such as [[Azo compound|azo-initiator compounds]]. Azo-initiators are considered to produce the [[peroxyl radical]] by heating, which damages the fluorescent molecule, resulting in the loss of fluorescence. [[Antioxidant]]s are considered to protect the fluorescent molecule from the oxidative degeneration.  The degree of protection is quantified using a [[fluorometer]]. Fluorescein is currently used most as a fluorescent probe.  Equipment that can automatically measure and calculate the capacity is commercially available (Biotek, Roche Diagnostics).

The fluorescent intensity decreases as the oxidative degeneration proceeds, and this intensity is typically recorded for 35 minutes after the addition of the azo-initiator (free radical generator). So far, AAPH (2,2’-azobis(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride) is the sole free-radical generator used. The degeneration (or decomposition) of fluorescein  is measured as the presence of the antioxidant slows the fluorescence decay. Decay curves (fluorescence intensity vs. time) are recorded and the area between the two decay curves (with or without antioxidant) is calculated. Subsequently, the degree of antioxidant-mediated protection is quantified using the antioxidant [[trolox]] (a vitamin E analogue) as a standard. Different concentrations of trolox are used to make a standard curve, and test samples are compared to this. Results for test samples (foods) have been published as "trolox equivalents" or TEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang D, Ou B, Prior RL | title = The chemistry behind antioxidant capacity assays | journal = J. Agric. Food Chem. | volume = 53 | issue = 6 | pages = 1841–56 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15769103 | doi = 10.1021/jf030723c }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garrett_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garrett AR, Murray BK, Robison RA, O'Neill KL | title = Measuring antioxidant capacity using the ORAC and TOSC assays | journal = Methods Mol. Biol. | volume = 594 | issue = | pages = 251–62 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20072922 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-60761-411-1_17 | series = Methods in Molecular Biology | isbn = 978-1-60761-410-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One benefit of using the ORAC method to evaluate substances' antioxidant capacities is that it takes into account samples with and without lag phases of their antioxidant capacities. This is especially beneficial when measuring foods and supplements that contain complex ingredients with various slow- and fast-acting antioxidants, as well as ingredients with combined effects that cannot be precalculated.

Drawbacks of this method are: 1) only antioxidant activity against particular (probably mainly peroxyl) radicals is measured; however, peroxyl radical formation has never been proven; 2) the nature of the damaging reaction is not characterized; 3) there is no evidence that free radicals are involved in this reaction; and 4) there is no evidence that ORAC values have any biological significance following consumption of any food. Moreover, the relationship between ORAC values and a health benefit has not been established.

Resulting from scientific refutation of the physiological significance of ORAC, the USDA, which had been collating and publishing ORAC data for more than a decade, withdrew its web publication of ORAC values for common American foods in May 2012.&lt;ref name=USDAx/&gt;

Several modified ORAC methods have been proposed.  Most of them employ the same principle (i.e. measurement of AAPH-radical mediated damage of fluorescein); however, ORAC-EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance-based ORAC method directly measures the decrease of AAPH-radical level by the scavenging action of the antioxidant substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kohri S, Fujii H, Oowada S, Endoh N, Sueishi Y, Kusakabe M, Shimmei M, Kotake Y | title = An oxygen radical absorbance capacity-like assay that directly quantifies the antioxidant's scavenging capacity against AAPH-derived free radicals | journal = Anal.

==Regulatory guidance==
In the following discussion, the term "antioxidant" refers mainly to non-nutrient compounds in foods, such as [[polyphenol]]s, which have antioxidant capacity'' [[in vitro]]'', so provide an artificial index of antioxidant strength—the ORAC measurement.

Other than for dietary antioxidant vitamins—[[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]]—no food compounds have been proved with antioxidant efficacy ''[[in vivo]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Accordingly, regulatory agencies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration]] of the United States and the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) have published guidance forbidding food product labels to claim or imply an antioxidant benefit when no such physiological evidence exists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/ucm063064.htm Guidance for Industry, Food Labeling; Nutrient Content Claims; Definition for "High Potency" and Definition for "Antioxidant" for Use in Nutrient Content Claims for Dietary Supplements and Conventional Foods] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=efsa&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1489 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1489 |title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to various food(s)/food constituent(s) and protection of cells from premature aging, antioxidant activity, antioxidant content and antioxidant properties, and protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/20061 |author=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies |journal=EFSA Journal |year=2010 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=1489}}&lt;/ref&gt; This guidance for the United States and European Union establishes it is illegal to imply potential health benefits on package labels of products with high ORAC.

==Physiological context==
Although research ''in vitro'' indicates [[polyphenol]]s are good [[antioxidant]]s and probably influence the ORAC value, antioxidant effects ''in vivo'' are probably negligible or absent.&lt;ref name=USDAx/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams RJ, Spencer JP, Rice-Evans C 2004 838–49"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams RJ, Spencer JP, Rice-Evans C | title = Flavonoids: antioxidants or signalling molecules? | journal = Free Radic.

Adapted from a news release issued by Oregon State University&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in antioxidant capacity of blood seen after the consumption of polyphenol-rich (ORAC-rich) foods is not caused directly by the polyphenols, but most likely results from increased [[uric acid]] levels derived from metabolism of flavonoids.&lt;ref name = Lotito/&gt;&lt;ref name="LPI"/&gt; According to Frei, "we can now follow the activity of flavonoids in the body, and one thing that is clear is that the body sees them as foreign compounds and is trying to get rid of them."&lt;ref name="LPI"/&gt;

==Food sources==
Values are expressed as the sum of the [[lipid]] soluble (e.g. [[carotenoid]]) and [[water-soluble]] (e.g. [[polyphenol|phenolic]]) antioxidant fractions (i.e., “total ORAC”) reported as in micromoles [[trolox]] equivalents (TE) per 100&amp;nbsp;gram sample, and are compared to assessments of total polyphenol content in the samples.

These values are considered biologically irrelevant by the EFSA and USDA.&lt;ref name=USDAx/&gt;&lt;ref name=efsa/&gt;

With nearly all vegetables, conventional boiling can reduce the ORAC value by up to 90%, while steaming retains more of the antioxidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ninfali P, Mea G, Giorgini S, Rocchi M, Bacchiocca M | title = Antioxidant capacity of vegetables, spices and dressings relevant to nutrition | journal = Br. J. Nutr. | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–66 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15788119 | doi = 10.1079/BJN20041327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons of ORAC values==

The United States Department of Agriculture, previously a publisher of ORAC data, withdrew its web publication of ORAC values for common American foods in 2012 due to absence of scientific evidence that ORAC has any biological significance.&lt;ref name=USDAx/&gt;

When comparing ORAC data, care must be taken to ensure the units and food being compared are similar. Some evaluations will compare ORAC units per gram of dry weight of the intact food or its milled powder, others will evaluate ORAC units in fresh or frozen wet weight, and still others will look at ORAC units per serving. Under each evaluation, different foods can appear to have higher ORAC values. For example, although a raisin has no more antioxidant potential than the grape from which it was dried, raisins will appear to have a higher ORAC value per gram of wet weight than grapes due to their reduced water content. Likewise, the large water content in watermelon can make it appear as though this fruit is low in ORAC. Similarly, the typical quantity of food used should be considered; herbs and spices may be high in ORAC, but are applied in much smaller quantities compared to intact whole foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tapsell LC, Hemphill I, Cobiac L, Patch CS, Sullivan DR, Fenech M, Roodenrys S, Keogh JB, Clifton PM, Williams PG, Fazio VA, Inge KE | title = Health benefits of herbs and spices: the past, the present, the future | journal = Med. J. Aust. | volume = 185 | issue = 4 Suppl | pages = S4–24 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17022438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous health food and beverage companies and marketers have erroneously capitalized on the ORAC rating by promoting products claimed to be "high in ORAC". As most of these ORAC values have not been independently validated or subjected to [[peer review]] for publication in scientific literature, they remain unconfirmed, are not scientifically credible, and may mislead consumers.

'''''Porphyridium cruentum''''' is a species of [[red alga]] in the family [[Porphyridiophyceae]].

The microalga ''Porphyridium sp''. is a potential source for several products like fatty acids, lipids, cell-wall polysaccharides  and pigments . The polysaccharides of this species are sulphated and their structure gives rise to some unique properties that could lead to a broad range of industrial and pharmaceutical applications. Additionally, ''P. cruentum'' biomass contains carbohydrates of up to 57% have been reported. Thus, the combined amount of carbohydrates in biomass and exopolysaccharides of this microalga could potentially provide the source for bio-fuel and pharmaceutical &lt;ref&gt;http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/biol.2014.9.issue-2/s11535-013-0248-z/s11535-013-0248-z.xml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2478/s11535-013-0248-z | volume=9 | issue=2 | title=Effects of nitrogen on growth and carbohydrate formation in Porphyridium cruentum | journal=Open Life Sciences| year=2014 | last1=Razaghi | first1=Ali | last2=Godhe | first2=Anna | last3=Albers | first3=Eva }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primary enamel cuticle''', also called '''Nasmyth's membrane''', is thin [[Biological membrane|membrane]] of tissue also known as [[reduced enamel epithelium]] (REE) produced by the [[ameloblast]], that covers the [[tooth]] once it has erupted. This tissue is primarily [[basal lamina]]. It is usually worn away by mastication and cleaning. The primary enamel cuticle protects enamel from resorption by cells of the dental sac and also secretes desmolytic enzymes for elimination of the dental sac, allowing fusion between reduced enamel epithelium and oral epithelium. This process allows [[tooth eruption|eruption of the tooth]] without bleeding.

'''Project Gaia''' is a U.S. [[non-governmental]], [[non-profit]] organization involved in the creation of a commercially viable household market for alcohol-based fuels in Ethiopia and other countries in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name="ceihd"&gt;[http://ceihd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;sectionid=6&amp;id=50&amp;ItemId=1 "Impact of Improved Stoves and Fuels on IAP"], CEIHD Center for Entrepreneurship in International Health and Development. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The project considers alcohol fuels to be a solution to fuel shortages, environmental damage, and public health issues caused by traditional cooking in the developing world. Targeting poor and marginalized communities that face health issues from cooking over polluting fires, Gaia currently works in [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Brazil]], [[Haiti]], and [[Madagascar]], and is in the planning stage of projects in several other countries.

== Current cooking methods in energy poor communities: the problem ==

=== Biomass fuels and associated risks ===
[[File:Indoor Woodfire Stove.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A traditional Nigerian wood-fired stove|A small boy sits by his mother's traditional wood fuel stove. Because of the inefficient heat production of wood-fired stoves such as this one, women cook indoors for hours each day in poorly ventilated dwellings.]]

More than 3 billion people cook with wood fire worldwide. Approximately 60% of African families cook with traditional biomass, a percentage that increases to 90% for Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt; Smoke and gaseous emissions pour out of burning wood, animal dung, or crop residues, leading to lung disease and respiratory illnesses in women and children. Traditional biomass fuels release emissions that contain pollutants dangerous to health, such as small particles, [[carbon monoxide|carbon monoxide (CO)]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[butadiene]], [[formaldehyde]], and carcinogens such as [[benzopyrene]] and [[benzene]]. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that more than 4 million people die each year from household air pollution generated by cooking with solid fuels in poorly ventilated spaces. 500,000 of these deaths are from childhood pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelancet.com/themed/global-burden-of-disease|title=DEFINE_ME_WA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indoor air pollution is especially deadly for children; it is responsible for nearly 50% of pneumonia deaths in children under the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|title=WHO - Household air pollution and health|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indoor air pollution ====
Because of their constant exposure to cook fires, women and children are particularly at risk. [[Indoor air pollution in developing nations|Indoor air pollution]] causes 56% of deaths and 80% of the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]] for children under the age of five.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt; Indoor air pollution also increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infections, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], and is associated with tuberculosis, [[perinatal mortality]], low birth weight, asthma, [[otitis media]], cancer of the upper airway, and [[cataract]]s. Respiratory disease in children is the leading cause of death for children, though [[malaria]] and diarrheal diseases are better known.&lt;ref name="changemakers"&gt;[http://proxied.changemakers.net/journal/300603/displayhealth.cfm-ID=208 "Removing Smoke from the Kitchen: An Alcohol Fueled Global Clean Cooking Initiative"], Changemakers.net, an initiative of Ashoka. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Indoor air pollution also disproportionately effects refugee, poor urban, and HIV/AIDs populations living in crowded and poorly ventilated conditions, and already carrying the burden of disease.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Fuel collection ====
[[File:Woman Carrying Bundle of Wood, Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|alt=Ethiopian woman carrying large bundle of firewood outside of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|In Entoto, on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, thousands of women and girls collect firewood. They carry heavy loads for many miles which they will use or sell as woodfuel. In Ethiopia 90% of energy comes from biomass like wood and charcoal.]]

===== Personal safety =====
Meanwhile, collecting wood involves risk to personal safety. Women and older children usually collect wood, often facing gender-based harassment and disputes with landowners who accuse them of trespassing. Women in Ethiopia's [[UNHCR]] refugee camps say that they fear assault, rape, and violence while searching for wood.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Refugee Commission. [http://womensrefugeecommission.org/search?q=working+women+at+risk "Working Women At Risk: The Links Between Making a Living and Sexual Violence for Refugees in Ethiopia."]. 27 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Deforestation and desertification =====
Beyond these public health issues, cooking with wood fires is also unsustainable and contributes to rapid deforestation in the developing world.  Where wood is already limited, its collection leads to desertification. In Africa, collection of wood for cooking and charcoal production is the primary reason for the disappearance of the forests.&lt;ref name="poet"&gt;Flannery-Allen, Julie. [http://www.poet.com/vital/2010/2/stoves-that-save.asp "Vital, Ethanol brings an energy revolution to households in the developing world"]. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the burning of hydrocarbon fuels, coal, charcoal, and even dung contributes to the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Smoky cooking fires and stoves contribute to the soot that is estimated to cause approximately 16% of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (IGSD). [http://www.hedon.info/docs/COP14_IGSD_INECE_BlackCarbonBriefingNote.pdf "Reducing Black Carbon May Be the Fastest Strategy for Slowing Climate Change. IGSD/INECE Climate Briefing Note"]. Retrieved 27 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black carbon|Black carbon particles]] in the atmosphere are considered one of the most dangerous pollutants after carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Furthermore, higher rates of deforestation and desertification force women to travel further and further to gather fuelwood, increasing their vulnerability to the dangers of fuelwood collection.

=== Alternatives to biomass fuels ===
The available alternatives to biomass fuels do not offer much improvement. [[Kerosene]] is imported at significant expense, and is burnt with a wick stove that does not combust the fuel efficiently and tips or spills easily. The projected retail cost of ethanol is lower than that of government-subsidized kerosene in Ethiopia today.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Kerosene stoves are also prone to flare ups and explosions; accidental kerosene fires cause many injuries and deaths each year.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Kerosene releases carcinogenic emissions and is often poorly refined or [[Adulterant|adulterated]] by the time it is acquired for domestic use.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; [[Liquified petroleum gas|Liquified petroleum gas (LPG)]] burns cleanly but is expensive and cannot be produced locally. Charcoal, a processed biomass fuel, burns with less smoke, but emits carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Meanwhile, coal produces all of the dangerous emissions of traditional biomass fuels and depending on its quality, also produces [[sulfur oxides]] and toxic elements such as [[arsenic]], [[lead]], [[fluorine]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:Niger Delta Gas-Flares.jpg|thumb|alt=Gas flares in the Niger delta.|The Niger delta flares an estimated 17 billion cubic meters of gases—enough fuel to provide the combined annual natural gas consumption of Germany and France (World Bank). The numerous oil spills and the gas flaring (100 sites burning consecutively for 40 years) in much of the delta have taken a toll on the environment. [[Pollution]] has affected the air, water, soils, vegetation and even physical structures (UNDP, Nigeria 2006). If this natural gas were converted to methanol (a simple alcohol), there would be enough alcohol produced to provide cooking fuel for every home in Africa.]]

=== Aid and energy ===
Aid initiatives and emergency response projects rarely provide energy for cooking, focusing instead on food rations and necessary cookware.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Occasionally the UNHCR purchases and provides biomass and transports it to communities where it is desperately needed.  When aid projects do involve stoves, many undertake the dissemination of improved biomass stoves. These burn biomass fuel more efficiently but do not eliminate the household need for biomass nor eliminate indoor air pollution.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

== The solution: alcohol fuels and clean cookstoves ==
[[File:USI bioethanol plant.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of the USI bioethanol plant in Brazil|In a continuous process, this USI bioethanol plant produces 95°GL ethanol from starch and sucrose at a rate of 10 liters per hour.]]

=== Alcohol fuels ===

Alcohol fuels have a [[Flammability limit|low-flammability limit (LFL)]] that is higher than [[Fossil fuel|hydrocarbon fuels]], which means they do not catch fire easily, even when spilled. They are extinguishable by water and are not prone to explosion like LPG (propane and butane). Alcohol burns cleanly, producing only [[carbon dioxide]] and water vapor, and none of the [[soot]] or toxic chemicals produced by solid fuels and kerosene.
Alcohol fuels are clean (with particle emissions far below the WHO levels).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/indoorair/health_impacts/exposure/en/index.html "Pollution and Exposure Levels." Retrieved 27 August 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; When paired with an efficient stove, alcohol fuels can drastically improve indoor air quality, and thus improve respiratory health and quality of life by reducing the global burden of disease."  &lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/indoorair/health_impacts/burden_global/en/index.html "Global Burden of Disease." Retrieved 27 August 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol is beginning to gain wider recognition as a source of fuel.  Because of initiatives like Project Gaia, the UNDP has placed the previously absent ethanol and methanol near the top of its “energy ladder,” a progression of fuels that range from dirty and inefficient (e.g. biomass) to clean and efficient (e.g. biogas, LPG, ethanol, methanol).&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Project Gaia believes in gradual introduction of ethanol-burning appliances into both the private household market and the small or large institutional market, to ensure widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  As the alcohol fuel market increases, and acceptance of clean cookstoves grows, Project Gaia sees the potential for the use of other high-performing alcohol appliances that provide lighting, refrigeration and air-tempering, and generation.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Ethanol ====
[[Ethanol]] can be produced locally from byproducts that would otherwise cause environmental damage. It can be produced from [[biomass]], [[natural gas]], [[coal]], and even [[landfill gas]]—resources plentiful in many developing countries.  The [[Renewable energy in Africa|use of alcohol fuel for household fuel]], therefore, is efficient resource management—transforming waste products to a highly valuable resource.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;  This transformation can lead to a cleaner environment, the forming of new jobs in industry, agriculture, manufacturing, and the service sector, and a decreased need for imported fuels.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;

=== Clean cookstoves ===

==== The CleanCook Stove ====
[[File:Clean Cook with Ethiopian Cookware.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two-burner CleanCook stove with round-based Ethiopian pots.|The two-burner CleanCook is pictured with traditional, round-based, Ethiopian pots. The stove has been tested and modified to meet the needs of the local culture.]]
[[File:CleanCook One-Burner with flame.jpg|thumb|left|alt=CleanCook One-Burner Stove with Flame|The CleanCook one-burner stove. The canister is the same as the two-burner stove, holding 1.2 liters and cooking for 4.5 hours—enough for one day of cooking for a typical family.]]

===== Origins =====
Project Gaia's team currently works with the alcohol-based CleanCook stove, a stable, stainless steel, one or two-burner stove adapted from the Origo stove invented by Bengt Ebbeson in 1979 and manufactured by Swedish company Dometic AB, the leading manufacturer of alcohol stoves and appliances worldwide. The Origo stove, recognized as the best alcohol stove available, is popular in the leisure markets in the U.S. and Europe, commonly for boating and camping use.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"&gt;[http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/gaia08 “Clean, safe ethanol stoves for refugee homes”], The Ashden Awards for sustainable energy. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The stove's working life is to projected to be 5–10 years for daily use.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  Project Gaia works to adapt the stove to local cooking needs and habits. Some of the adaptations made to the CleanCook include the slight raising and redesign of the pot-stand to allow for larger pots and for more oxygen to reach the flame, and the addition of handles to make transport and refill of the stove easier.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

===== Dometic =====
Dometic seeks to address the developing world market because alcohol fuel technologies are particularly appropriate for it.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;  The CleanCook contains a non-pressurized, no-spill fuel tank that can hold [[methanol]] or [[ethanol]]. The CleanCook stove was designed with several specific safety measures.  The CleanCook stove's fuel canister holds an absorbent mineral fiber covered by a protective metal mesh, preventing fuel from spilling from the canister even when the stove is inverted.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt; The design of this fuel tank eliminates risk of explosion, flare-up, or leakage, and other safety features built into the stove make the CleanCook less likely to cause burns than other cooking methods.&lt;ref name="ceihd"/&gt;  Meanwhile, the CleanCook is a high-performing stove, equivalent in power (1.5 to 2[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]]) and temperature to an LPG stove.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:Spill Proof Fuel Canisters.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Demonstration of the spill-proof canisters of the CleanCook stove|At the Dom Orione pilot study in rural Brazil, Harry Stokes of the Stokes Consulting Group demonstrates the CleanCook's spill-proof canister to Sanyogita Seksaria of the Shell Foundation as Regina Couto, Director of Projeto Gaia Brasil, looks on.]]

===== Operation of the Stove =====
To operate the stove, its fuel canister must be filled with one liter of ethanol. If pouring the fuel results in drops around the hole, these must be wiped away. The canister must be clipped onto the base of the stove, the regulator opened, and the ethanol vapor lit with a match or lighter.  After cooking, the canister should be left in position to limit further evaporation of remaining ethanol.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

===== Emissions vs. performance =====
The US-based [[Aprovecho|Aprovecho Research Center]] has conducted tests comparing the emissions and energy performance of the CleanCook in comparison with conventional LPG and kerosene stoves.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  When compared with kerosene, the CleanCook used less energy, produced lower emissions, and was quicker than to bring water to a boil.  Compared with LPG, the CleanCook produced the same level of particulate emissions, but LPG released lower emissions of CO and was quicker to boil water.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  The [[UNDP]] in Malawi compared the CleanCook with wood and charcoal stoves and found that the CleanCook cut wood stoves’ CO emission in half, particulate emission by 99%, and energy use by 71%. The findings in comparison with charcoal showed similar results, with the energy use decreased by 55% and the emission and particulate reduction even greater than for wood stoves.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

== Local production and sustainability ==
Project Gaia believes that [[sustainable business]] is the best way to accomplish the goal of providing clean and safe cooking technology, and is supported by the [http://www.undp.org/partners/business/gsb/whatcangsbdo.shtml UNDP Growing Sustainable Business (GSB)] in its initiatives to bring the private and public sectors together.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Project Gaia's business model involves the merging of stove manufacture and sale with fuel production and sale, thereby giving consumers confidence that they will receive fuel after purchasing stoves, and also allowing part of the stoves’ costs to transfer to the fuel.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  This financing mechanism is the model used for mobile phones and airtime – the initial cost of the stove would be cheaper to ensure its affordability, and this discount would be recovered over the course of several years in a very small mark-up in fuel cost.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Another benefit of this system is that it allows for ownership of the right to produce the stove or parts of the stove in Ethiopia.  The CleanCook is currently manufactured in Slovakia, but the possibility of local production in Ethiopia is currently being explored.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Local production is in its early stages in Addis Ababa, with a starting goal of 18,000 stoves to be produced yearly.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;  Project Gaia's business goals also include  certification through the [[CDM Gold Standard]] for dissemination of CleanCook stoves and promotion of alcohol fuels.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

== Impact through education ==

Education about indoor air pollution is a fundamental element of Project Gaia's mission, which it has pursued by spreading awareness about the impact of IAP through workshops, seminars, media coverage, and engagement with local, state, and federal government, and organizations such as the [[WHO]] in Ethiopia, and the [[FDRE]]’s Ministry of Health.  The danger of IAP and its effects on populations is often neglected, with malaria, HIV/AIDS, and infectious diseases receiving the majority of attention.

Project Gaia is also working to educate the public about alcohol fuels and their potential for use in the developing world, and specifically, in the context of household energy.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; The market for families throughout the developing world that could benefit from the use of alcohol fuels for cooking and household energy is in the range of 600 million.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; As stated by the UNDP World Energy Assessment (2000), supplying modern energy services to the two billion people who still cook with traditional solid fuels and lack access to electricity is one of the most pressing problems facing humanity today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/energy/activities/wea/drafts-frame.html "World Energy Assessment: Energy and the Challenge of Sustainability"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609101755/http://www.undp.org/energy/activities/wea/drafts-frame.html |date=2007-06-09 }}, UNDP.

==== The Gaia Association ====
The Ethiopian counterpart of Project Gaia, Inc. is the Ethiopian non-governmental organization, the Gaia Association, which is a UNHCR implementing partner. Ethiopia possesses all of the necessary factors for successful technology transfer of alcohol fuel: the quantity of ethanol produced by its sugar industry, the fact that it depends on imported petroleum fuels and biomass, and its need for improved fuels and safer stoves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedon.info/ProjectGaiaEthiopia “Project Gaia Ethiopia”], HEDON Household Energy Network. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Ethiopia was producing approximately 8 million liters of ethanol annually.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Molasses and other byproducts of the industry were being dumped in Ethiopia's rivers until about a decade ago when one of Ethiopia's five mills, Finchaa Sugar Company, solved the waste problem by acquiring a distillery and producing ethanol.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt; Gaia answered an early query that Finchaa Sugar opened, proposing a household energy market for the ethanol, as no gasoline blending or export market was being successfully developed.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Ethiopia's other mills have also become interested in producing ethanol, as a way to balance the fluctuations of sugar pricing.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Ethiopia's government is developing plans to build ethanol-producing distilleries at all sugar mills, creating an ethanol supply that could fuel over 200,000 stoves.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

Gaia is now planning to build its own micro distillery in Ethiopia as a demonstration project for what can be achieved with small and micro scale distillation plants. Gaia is working with the Ethiopian Environmental Protection authority, the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Ministry of Agriculture to build this distillery.  A range of feedstocks are being considered, including more conventional feedstocks such as molasses, and sugar cane or sweet sorghum juice, or unconventional feedstocks such as fruit waste from the markets in Addis Ababa or sugary materials from plants growing wild such as cactus, the bean pods from the mesquite tree (Prosopis), a noxious invasive species in Ethiopia,  or the Giant Milkweed plant (Calotropis procera).  Gaia is hoping to encourage  very small scale distilleries owned by farmer groups or co-ops and small to medium-sized local entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.esmap.org/beia/BEIA_call_for_proposals_pilot_projects_English.pdf “African Renewable Energy Access Biomass Energy Initiative for Africa”], Retrieved 27 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fuel blending ====
The domestic fuel blending market and the export market for ethanol remain difficult in Ethiopia for several reasons.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; The technical precision and regulation necessary for successful blending has prevented its success in Ethiopia; major petroleum sellers like Shell, Total, Mobil, and domestic companies such as National Oil resist the blending of ethanol in petroleum fuels because the fuel supply system is poorly regulated and the fuel is sometimes [[adulterated]].&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Fuel sellers cannot trust the integrity of their fuel if blended with ethanol, because the ethanol may take up water into the fuel and promote [[phase separation]] and worsened contamination.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  As for the export market, Ethiopia's ethanol production is too small to attract large international buyers and has only succeeded in selling ethanol at lower prices than other exporters.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Ethiopia's landlocked location also makes export difficult.  The local selling of Finchaa's ethanol, therefore, provides a sustainable opportunity for Ethiopia, with prices that are affordable but also competitive with the potential export market.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:Awbarre Deforestation.jpg|thumb|left|View from the road, between Jijiga and the Awbarre camp; the land is desolate as a result of the heavy deforestation, making it difficult to grow crops or collect firewood. Refugees often must resort to digging up roots for fuel.]]

==== Deforestation ====
Ethiopia is energy-poor and 95-98% deforested, although most of its population still depends on biomass fuels.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Before beginning its pilot studies, Gaia found that refugee families use approximately 3.7 tons of fuel wood a year, and spend up to eight hours every two or three days collecting this wood.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

==== Pilot testing and stove placement ====
CleanCook stoves have now been tested in and placed in three UNHCR refugee camps, HIV/AIDS orphanages run by [[Mother Teresa#Missionaries of Charity|Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity]], in a rural village in [[Somali Region|Ethiopia's Somali State]], and in lower and middle-income private homes in Addis Ababa. Pilot studies conducted by the Gaia Association have yielded positive results and acceptance and widespread approval among households both in the refugee camps and in Addis Ababa. Project Gaia is also working to bring stove manufacturing to Addis Ababa by linking the Ethiopian business Makobu Enterprises PLC and Dometic AB, and encouraging government support for the designation of ethanol for household fuel purposes.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Refugee camps in Ethiopia ====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Denan Refugee Camp.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Ethiopian Somali Refugee camp on the outskirts of Denan|Ethiopian Somalis living on the outskirts of Denan, deep in the Somali regional state, are semi-nomadic herders. Having been left without animals due to drought or flood, they have come to this makeshift camp. At the time this picture was taken, they had not eaten in many days and were in desperate need for both food and water.]] --&gt;

===== Environmental impact =====
Refugee camps in Eastern Ethiopia that house refugees of Somali conflict have placed heavy pressure on the environment and resources of Ethiopia for the past two decades, reaching a combined population of 600,000 refugees in the early 1990s. The UNHCR and its partner NGOs supply these camps with basic needs but have not provided cooking fuel until recently. Fuel wood gathering, the responsibility of refugee women, has resulted in the almost complete deforestation of the regions around the refugee camps, and Ethiopia's government has banned all cutting of live trees around the camps.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt; The UNHCR must provide alternatives to wood fuel at any new refugee camps.

===== Active projects =====
Project Gaia is currently active in Awbarre refugee camp (formerly known as Teferi Ber) and [[Kebri Beyah|Kebribeyah]] refugee camp, where all of the camp's approximately 1780 families have CleanCook stoves and a daily ration of ethanol, funded cooperatively by the UNHCR and the Gaia Association. The combined population of Kebribeyah and Awbarre camps is approximately 27,000 people, and the UNHCR is planning to re-open at least two more camps to make room for past refugees who have fled to Ethiopia again after returning to Somalia and experiencing worsening conditions since July 2007.&lt;ref name="ashdenawards"/&gt;

In 2012, Gaia Association received a grant from the Nordic Climate Fund (NCF) to demonstrate the feasibility of locally produced ethanol for cooking. The grant provided funds to build a community owned and operated ethanol microdistillery. The distillery, which is currently under construction in the Kolfe-Keranio community on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, will be run by a local women's cooperative, the Former Women Fuelwood Carriers Association.

Also in 2012, in an effort to address the environmental and social problems associated with the overreliance on traditional biomass for household cooking, Gaia Association, together with the Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority, is piloting a project to demonstrate small-scale, community owned and driven ethanol production from sugarcane (in the form of ethanol microdistilleries) in Amhara, Oromya &amp; Gambella regional states. Partial installation of the EMDs has been completed in two of the three regional states.

==== Partnerships ====
Project Gaia works in collaboration with many organizations that help support pilot studies, encourage government involvement, and provide local or regional support. Gaia's lead business partners are members of the [[United Nations Global Compact]], and many members of the Gaia team have joined the Partners for Clean Indoor Air (PCIA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pciaonline.org/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; which developed out of the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD) in Johannesburg with the goal of cleaning up indoor air.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt; Project Gaia is also a member of the HEDON Household Energy Network which unites key actors and stakeholders in the movement for a cleaner, more efficient, and affordable household energy sector.

In Ethiopia, Gaia has created partnerships with organizations that serve poor communities and refugee camps.  Gaia's Ethiopia partners include the UNHCR-RLO and the UNDP, the Good Shepherd Sisters, the Missionaries of Charity, the Former Women Fuelwood Carriers’ Association, Finchaa Sugar Company, the Ethiopian Rural Energy Development and Promotion Center, and the Ogaden Welfare and Development Association. Under its Breathe Easy Program, the Shell Foundation is a technical and a funding partner for Gaia's Ethiopia and Brazil projects. These partners have supported Gaia's pilot studies and helped to strengthen the relationships between Ethiopian businesses and European and American businesses, with the goal of facilitating the sustainable transfer of technology, goods, and services to Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
[[File:Lucy with stove in Nigeria.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Nigerian woman demonstrates her daily use of the Clean Cook Stove|A Nigerian woman demonstrates her daily use of the Clean Cook Stove]]

By 2050 Nigeria is expected to outgrow the population of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/03/10-projections-for-the-global-population-in-2050/|title=10 projections for the global population in 2050|date=3 February 2014|work=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market for cookstoves- and more importantly, cooking fuels- is huge. Spurring both ethanol and methanol production will create local jobs, help give farmers new markets, and be locally sourced.

Nigeria, like Ethiopia has high potential for large-scale ethanol production from starchy cassava and sugarcane molasses.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Nigeria also possesses an excess of natural gas in the form of gas flares; it is responsible for 40% of worldwide flaring. This natural gas can be easily converted to methanol and Nigeria's flared gas alone could fuel CleanCook stoves in every household in West Africa. Nigeria, like other West African countries, is energy poor and depends on fuelwood for cooking.  In Nigeria, Project Gaia depends on the local support of the Centre of Household Energy and Health, based in the Niger Delta. Gaia's main sponsor in Delta State is the U.S. EPA in partnership with the Delta State Government.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

Gaia's technical partner for Nigeria, HydroChem, which is part of the Linde Group, is the leading provider of small-scale hydrogen, CO, and CO2 plants. These plants are easily adapted to manufacture methanol, by converting natural gas into liquid form, and thereby creating a fuel that can be used in the household energy market.  In gas or electric form, it is not feasible for the developing world market because of the investment, infrastructure, and maintenance necessary and subsidies that are required to make it affordable.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  HydroChem's plants are ideal for local, small-scale production at low expense in countries like Nigeria, where gas flares could be converted into household fuel.

Currently, Project Gaia is working with local commercial partners to begin a 10,000 stove pilot study.

=== Brazil ===
Project Gaia studied the acceptance of the CleanCook ethanol stove in different urban and rural households in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil between 2006-2007. Because LPG was too costly for low-income families, most households in the study had been using firewood for cooking. In some areas, woodfuel collection is banned. Participating families could get fuel for cooking easily and cheaply at the gas pump. Households found ethanol easy, safe and affordable to use. The ability to buy ethanol in small quantities, rather than being forced to purchase large canisters of LPG, was most beneficial to low-income households.

Brazil's strong social policies have helped to lift families out of poverty and increase access to energy. As Brazil develops, Project Gaia is working to replicate the Brazilian model in other project sites. Project Gaia's work continues in partnership with [http://www.prolenha.org.br/ Prolenha].

=== Madagascar ===
[[File:Stove Testing Madagascar.jpg|thumb|left|n Antananarivo, Madagascar, a cook lights a traditional three stove fire. Here she is boiling meat as one of the steps of the Controlled Cooking Test.

Project Gaia began work in Madagascar beginning in 2008 at the request of the Government of Madagascar. Project Gaia's work is commissioned with the objective of multifaceted contribution to the goals of the Africa Action Plan (AAP) and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to the goals of several initiatives related to the development of alternative household energy sources. Gaia's work with household or indoor air pollution will address other MDGs such as the promotion of gender equality, improving maternal health, and ensuring environmental sustainability. The Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) is one initiative that is working to promote alternative sources of energy that will decrease the burden on Madagascar's forests and to reduce child mortality, a large factor of which is the household use of solid fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://practicalactionconsulting.org/consulting/capabilities_energy?id=200806 “Assessment of Ethanol as a Household Fuel”], Practical Action Consulting. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Project Gaia's involvement also contributes to goals in several specific sectors including those of the Ministère de l’Environnement, des Eaux et Forêts et du Tourisme, the Ministère de l’Energie et des Mines, the Ministère de la Santé, du Planning Familial et de la Protection, the Ministère de l’Agriculture, Elevage et la Pêche, and the [http://www.tanymeva.org.mg/ Foundation Tany Meva] - piloting community-based use of ethanol for household cooking.

=== Haiti ===
Project Gaia launched operations in Haiti, in response to the increased need for relief after the [[Hurricane Tomas|2010 hurricane]] and in the hopes of contribution to the “Build Back Better” strategy being developed by Haiti's government and other engaged nations and organizations. That Haiti is more than 98% deforested makes transition away from wood fuels essential, especially since 70% of Haiti's population continues to rely on charcoal and firewood for fuel. Since the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake]], Haitian families have been spending at least 40% of their income on charcoal and all fuel prices have surged.&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/30042996/PGI-Haiti-Handout-3-10-10 “Project Gaia &amp; Haiti”], Project Gaia, Inc. Retrieved 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Haiti has great potential for local, sustainable production of ethanol because of its past status as a significant sugar cane producer and the capacity for revival of this industry. One million tons of sugar cane is produced annually – a decrease from 3 million in 1987 – and sugar mills and distilleries are already in place.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; Ethanol, even before it is produced locally, can still be sold locally for a lower price than Haitian charcoal.

For this project, Gaia is receiving donations of ethanol fuel for CleanCook stoves from the Brazilian government and the Brazilian ethanol industry. Gaia's approach in Haiti involves three phases: 1) small-scale emergency intervention through donation of 500–5000 stoves, and work with local mills and distilleries to scale up domestic production of ethanol 2) larger-scale scale-up of 20,000–50,000 stoves and ethanol to IDP camps and large communities, partnership with other organizations and 3) sustainability work and local development, cooperation with government to encourage the passage of a [[biofuel]]s plan, assessment of the state of local mills and distilleries that are closed, and of the possibility for micro distillery.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt;

Gaia's collaborators for its Haiti Project include the Government of Haiti Ministry of Women's Affairs, Government of Brazil Ministry of External Relations, UNICA, COSAN, Dometic Group, Viva Rio Haiti, Marin Biological Lab (Woods Hole), CODEP, Terra Endeavors, Inc., J&amp;J Import, BDP International, Trees Water People, [[Public-Private Alliance Foundation]] (PPAF).

== Pilot studies and financial sustainability ==
[[File:Low Income Housing, Location of Pilot Stoves.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Ethiopian woman involved in PGI's pilot testing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, standing outside of her low income housing complex|During the pilot study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Gaia Association placed two-burner prototype stoves in 850 homes. 150 of the stoves were tested in very low-income homes like that of Senedu, pictured above, a resident of a low-income condominium in Addis Ababa. One goal of the study was to find a price for ethanol that would be affordable for the average household, but also partially subsidize the fuel for use in poorer households.]]
Gaia Association conducted thorough pilot studies on the use of different household fuels in Addis Ababa, their varying prices, and the rates of their consumption.  In 2004, Gaia began testing two-burner prototype stoves in 850 homes. Before and after the 850 stoves were placed, Gaia's field staff conducted household energy audits, consumer satisfaction studies and fuel price elasticity studies. In 50 homes, Gaia monitored IAP, recording levels of CO and particulate matter.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;  Approximately 150 of the stoves that were tested in Addis Ababa were placed in very low-income homes. This part of the study helped Gaia determine the ideal price level for ethanol so that it would be affordable to the average household and also reach the poorer households.

=== Pilot studies and business model ===
Throughout the process of pilot studies in each of its project sites, Gaia's team documented progress and compiled reports that charted the study results.  Project Gaia used the study results to develop its business plan and to answer questions such as: Who is interested in the stove? Who can produce it? How should it be adapted to better suit its use? Who can distribute it? Who can supply the fuel? How will stove and fuel be linked?&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

=== Simulation of future market conditions and local purchasing power ===
To simulate reality and ensure affordability of the stove, Gaia charged for ethanol during the Pilot studies.  After a month of free fuel, during which families could get used to cooking with the stove, each household paid for its fuel, allowing fuel use and rationing to be accurately documented. After the first month of purchasing fuel, its price was increased to reflect the cost of ethanol once the local market is fully developed. Price Elasticity studies documented the impact of the price increase on the family and their capacity and willingness to pay. Pilot study data showed that these households demonstrated the necessary purchasing power to afford CleanCook stoves and their fuel, if the purchasing price of the stove was subsidized.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

Even the poorest urban communities pay for cooking fuels because they cannot gather their fuel, as many refugees do in rural areas of Ethiopia. Wood and charcoal prices have risen because of the need to travel further and further outside of the city to gather them.  Poor families are often forced to pay more for fuel because they buy small quantities of low-quality fuel when they can afford to – sometimes before each meal. Even the lowest grade of fuel is often expensive when purchased this way.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;
[[File:FWFCA financial security.jpg|thumb|alt=An Ethiopian woman, a member of FWFCA, working at a loom|The Former Women Fuelwood Carriers Association (FWFCA) offers women an alternative to carrying fuelwood into Ethiopian cities. It was one of several instances in which, once relieved of firewood collection duties, women are able to work towards financial security. Instead of gathering firewood, women receive training on weaving and together produce scarves and other fabrics using looms. This offers women an alternative source of income.]]

=== Government subsidization of petroleum-based fuels and long-term financial impact ===
Domestically produced ethanol would not require as much subsidization as petroleum-based fuels like kerosene because it can be sold for a lower price. Its domestic production, meanwhile, benefits the economy, and the subsidy that is contributed for its purchase does not leave the country as it does for imported fuel.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

In the context of the refugee camps, ethanol was not sold because of the lack of purchasing power among refugees. When fuel gathering exhausts the little remaining biomass, energy provisions will have to be donor-supplied. Providing stoves and improved fuel, however, can save long-term costs by increasing productivity and well-being among refugees, increasing industry, and reducing health care costs.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;

Response to the stoves was very positive, both in households where families had experience with modern stoves and improved fuels, and in households without previous experience.  The dominant response included appreciation for the cleanliness and safety of the stove and fuel and a positive evaluation of the stove's power and efficiency. In the refugee camps, CleanCook stoves allowed more women to cook inside their homes, and diminished the need for fuel wood gathering and allowed women more time to pursue income-generating activities, take care of personal health, provide childcare, and seek education. A reduced amount of fuel wood gathering also eased tensions between refugees and local landowners who do not welcome the gathering of wood from their land.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt;

Many groups supported Gaia in its pilot studies, including the UNHCR management and logistical staff for the refugee camps, by the Refugee Care Netherlands (ZOA) staff and FDRE Administration for Refugee and Returnee Affairs (ARRA) staff, field survey staff from the Ethiopian Rural Energy Development and Promotion Center, an Ethiopian government agency under the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the UNDP Growing Sustainable Businesses Program, Winrock International's Clean Energy Group, Makobu Enterprises management personnel, Dometic AB representatives from Research &amp; Development, the Stove Division and Marketing, the Stokes Consulting Group, UNDP-GSB consultants, Finchaa Sugar, consultants from the Center for Entrepreneurship in International Health and Development at the University of California at Berkeley, and Shell Foundation advisors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">The '''Sisterhood Method''' is a household survey to estimate [[maternal death]]s recommended by the [[World Health Organization]]. Although maternal deaths are a major problem in developing countries, high quality data are rare. Yet, numbers are needed for planning in order to reduce the problem of maternal death. Several methods have been used to estimate maternal deaths. According to the WHO, "The approach was designed to overcome the problem of large sample sizes and thus reduce cost."&lt;ref&gt;The sisterhood method for estimating maternal mortality: Guidance notes for potential users, page 5. WHO. Geneva, Switzerland. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indirect estimation of maternal mortality: The sisterhood method. Graham W, Brass W, Snow RW. Stud Fam Planning. 1989:20(3):125-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The death of a woman during or shortly after a pregnancy is an important medical problem in developing countries. 99% of all maternal deaths occur in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Maternal mortality in 2000: Estimates developed by WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA. AbouZahar C, Wardlaw T (Eds). WHO. Geneva, Switzerland. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the poorest countries in the world, e.g. Sierra Leone, the lifetime risk for a woman dying because of a maternal death is approx 1 in 6, whereas in developed countries, e.g. Sweden, the same lifetime risk is approx 1 in 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Maternal mortality: Who, when, where, and why. Ronsmans C, Graham WJ; Lancet Maternal Survival Series Steering Group. Lancet. 2006;368(9542):1189-200.&lt;/ref&gt; Half of all maternal deaths occur in six countries only: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Worldwide, maternal deaths decreased from approx 500,000 in 1980 to approx 350,000 in 2008. This decline in maternal deaths was associated mainly with better maternal education, maternal income, increased availability of trained birth attendants, and decreased pregnancy rates.&lt;ref&gt;Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980-2008: A systematic analysis of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5. Hogan MC, Foreman KJ, Naghavi M, Ahn SY, Wang M, Makela SM, Lopez AD, Lozano R, Murray CJ. Lancet. 2010;375(9726):1609-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimating maternal deaths==
Although maternal deaths are a major problem in developing countries, seen globally, the numbers are not very large, and there is an absence of high quality data. Yet, numbers are needed for planning in order to reduce maternal deaths. Several methods have been used to estimate maternal deaths. They include analysing census records and medical/death certificates,&lt;ref&gt;Underreporting of maternal deaths on death certificates and the magnitude of the problem of maternal mortality. Horon IL. Am J Public Health. 2005;95(3):478-82.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Reproductive Age Mortality Studies'' (RAMOS).&lt;ref&gt;National maternal mortality study, 2005. Carried out by: Haceteppe University Medical School, Institute of Population Studies. For the Turkish Ministry of Health, the General Directorate of Mother and Child Health and Family Planning, and the Delegation of European Commission to Turkey. Ankara, Turkey. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, household surveys are used. All of these methods are not totally precise, but they can provide some useful information to decrease maternal mortality.

In contrast, full surveillance programmes would be too costly and too unrealistic for many developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Measuring maternal mortality: An overview of opportunities and options for developing countries. Graham WJ, Ahmed S, Stanton C, Abou-Zahr C, Campbell OM. BMC Med. 2008;6:12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sisterhood Method==
The Sisterhood Method is the most common household survey for estimating maternal deaths. It is time- and cost-effective, and reduces sample size requirements; in countries or areas with high levels of maternal deaths, i.e. over 500 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, a sample size of 4000 households or less is acceptable for this method.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.org/reproductive-health/publications/rht_97_28/RHT_97_28_chapter2.en.html&lt;/ref&gt; But the method still provides a useful means of assessing maternal mortality.

This method includes four questions about the sisters of the woman in question:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sisterhood Method for Estimating Maternal Mortality: Guidance notes for potential users|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1997/WHO_RHT_97.28.pdf?ua=1|website=www.who.org|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* How many sisters have you ever had, born to the same mother, who ever reached the age 15 (or who were ever married), including those who are now dead?
* How many of your sisters who reached the age of 15 are alive now?
* How many of these sisters are dead?
* How many of your sisters who are dead died during a pregnancy or during childbirth, or during the six weeks after the end of a pregnancy?

==Application==
Deaths occurring over a large interval of time are documented. The overall estimate of maternal mortality is determined for 10–12 years before the survey. The Sisterhood Method is useful because usually maternal mortality changes slowly. It provides some meaningful data in countries or areas where there are no alternative means of generating estimates.

==When should the Sisterhood Method not be used==
The Sisterhood Method is not appropriate in countries or areas where the total fertility rate is less than 4 children per family, in areas of significant migration, as well as during civil war, civil unrest or other significant social disruption.

==Variant ==
The original Sisterhood Method is an indirect method. The newer Direct Sisterhood Method targets a more limited reference period for sister deaths and uses more in depth questions (e.g., deaths among all siblings, all deaths that are pregnancy related, and when these deaths occurred). This variant relies on fewer assumptions than the original Sisterhood Method. However, it requires a larger sample size, data gathering and analysis are more complex, and has large confidence intervals. Despite these limitations, the Direct Sisterhood Method can result in greater specificity of information. A retrospective maternal mortality ratio (MMR) can be calculated. This variant is used by [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] (DHS).&lt;ref&gt;Direct and indirect estimates of maternal mortality from the Sisterhood Method. Rutenberg N, Sullivan JM (Eds). Washington DC, USA. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An assessment of DHS maternal mortality indicators. Stud Fam Planning. 2000:31(2):111-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suicide in Bangladesh''' is a common cause of unnatural death and a long term [[social issue]]. Of all the people reported dead due to [[suicide]] worldwide every year, 2.06% are [[Bangladeshi]].&lt;ref name="Bangladesh Suicide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh Suicide|url=http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/bangladesh-suicide|publisher=worldlifeexpectancy.com|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
According to a report by the [[World Health Organization]] 19,697 people committed suicide in [[Bangladesh]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Bangladesh Suicide" /&gt; According to a report by Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, [[Dhaka]], published in 2010, around 6,500,000 people of Bangladesh are prone to suicide. The rate is 128.08 people per 100,000 commit suicide in Bangladesh every year. The six-member team led by Dr AHM Feroz and Dr SM Nurul Islam of the medical college conducted the survey at Mominpur union of Chuadanga district from January to April 2010. But this has been noted that the above rate was assumed only based on survey conducted in one union which is not a good reflector of the total suicide rate in the whole country as total suicide rate per year is far less than what was mentioned in the report in the last couple of years.&lt;ref name="Survey says Bangladesh’s 6.5 million people of suicide-prone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey says Bangladesh’s 6.5 million people of suicide-prone|url=http://www.businessnews-bd.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2979:survey-says-bangladeshs-65-million-people-of-suicide-prone&amp;catid=67:offbeat&amp;Itemid=58|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]'', from 2002 to 2009, 73,389 people committed suicide in Bangladesh. Of these 73,389 people, 31,857 people hanged themselves and 41,532 swallowed poison to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="10,000 commit suicide a year"&gt;{{cite news|title=10,000 commit suicide a year|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=232009|accessdate=15 November 2012|newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bangladesh Manabadhikar Bastabayan Sangstha'', a human rights group of Bangladesh shows that from January 2011 to August 2011, 258 people committed suicide, and of them, 158 were women and the remainder were men.&lt;ref name="10,000 commit suicide a year" /&gt;

=== Suicide of women ===
According to a 2010 report by Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, of the 128.08 per 100,000 people who committed suicide in 2010, 89% were women and most them were unmarried.&lt;ref name="Survey says Bangladesh’s 6.5 million people of suicide-prone" /&gt; Statistics of ''Jatiya Mahila Ainjibi Samity,'', a Bangladeshi women's organizations shows, show that from 2006 to 2010, 40 girls committed suicide as victims of [[stalking]]. From 2001 to 2010, 4,747 women and girls committed suicide because of physical and domestic violence.&lt;ref name="10,000 commit suicide a year" /&gt;

According to a report published in the ''Lancet'' published in [[BBC News]], suicidal tendency among women in Bangladesh is higher, because they have inferior status in society. Another factor is a higher rate of illiteracy and their economic dependence on men.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi women 'at risk of suicide'"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladeshi women 'at risk of suicide'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/706487.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==2007 Adam House cult suicide==
{{see also|Adam House Cult mass suicide}}
In 2007, in [[Mymensingh]], a family of 9 committed [[mass suicide]] by hurling themselves onto a train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selim|first1=Nasima|title=An extraordinary truth? The Ādam “suicide” notes from Bangladesh|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13674670903061230|website=Taylor Francis Online|publisher=James P. Grant School of Public Health, BRAC University|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the diaries recovered from their home, they wanted a pure life as lived by Adam and Eve, freeing themselves from bondage to any religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mymensingh joint suicide defies common sense|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2007/07/12/mymensingh-joint-suicide-defies-common-sense|accessdate=30 May 2016|agency=BDNews24.com|issue=1|publisher=BDNews24.com|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common methods ==
[[Suicide by hanging|Hanging]] is the most common method of suicide in Bangladesh. There is no cost involvement in this method other than ligature material, i.e., a rope, and thus that is why it is the preferred method.&lt;ref name="Hanging as a method of suicide"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=M|author2=Hossain, MZ |title=Hanging as a Method of Suicide: Retrospective Analysis of Postmortem Cases|journal=Journal of Armed Forces Medical College, Bangladesh|date=14 March 2011|volume=6|issue=2|doi=10.3329/jafmc.v6i2.7273|url=http://www.banglajol.info/index.php/JAFMC/article/view/7273/5499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swallowing poison is another common method in Bangladesh to commit suicide. In urban areas, people follow other methods to commit suicide, such as by an overdose of barbiturate tablets, or by other means.

'''''The Big Necessity: The Unmentionable World of Human Waste and Why It Matters''''' (published in the United Kingdom as ''The Big Necessity: Adventures in the World of Human Waste''), written by [[Rose George]], is a descriptive representation of the history, advancement, cultural variation, solutions, and international need of [[sanitation]]. This work, written for the purpose of global awareness of sanitation, highlights the current state of a global crisis. George gives insight into how sanitation around the world depicts the standard of living in that area. George uses her own personal experiences as examples to explain the sanitary conditions of areas around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Rose|title=The Big Necessity: The Unmentionable World of Human Waste and Why it Matters|year=2008|location=New York, New York|isbn=9780805090833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Worldwide, 2.6 billion people (40% of the world's population) do not have sanitary facilities or systems to dispose of waste.&lt;ref&gt;Jewitt, Sarah.

'''''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism''''' is a 2003 book by the psychologist [[J. Michael Bailey]], published by [[Joseph Henry Press]].&lt;ref name="jhp"&gt;Bailey, J. Michael (2003). ''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism''. Joseph Henry Press, {{ISBN|978-0-309-08418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first section of the book, Bailey discusses gender-atypical behaviors and [[gender dysphoria]] in children, emphasizing the biological determination of gender.  In the second section he deals primarily with gay men, including the link between childhood gender dysphoria and male [[homosexuality]] later in life. Bailey reviews evidence that male homosexuality is congenital (a result of genetics and [[Prenatal#Prenatal period|prenatal]] environment), and he argues for the accuracy of some [[stereotype]]s about gay men.&lt;ref name="Bailey76"&gt;Bailey (2003), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; In the third section, Bailey summarizes evidence for a [[psychological typology]] of [[trans women]] that says there are two forms of [[transsexualism]] that affects transgender women: one that he describes as an extreme type of male homosexuality and one that is a sexual interest in having a female body, called [[autogynephilia]].

The book caused considerable controversy which led to complaints and a formal investigation by [[Northwestern University]], where Bailey was chair of the psychology department until shortly before the conclusion of the investigation. Northwestern ultimately found no basis for the complaints,&lt;ref name="Dreger2008"&gt;{{cite journal

==Summary==

''The Man Who Would Be Queen'' is divided into three sections: "The Boy Who Would Be Princess", "The Man He Might Become", and "Women Who Once Were Boys".

It starts with an anecdote about a child Bailey calls "Danny". Bailey writes of Danny's mother, who has been frustrated by other therapists she has seen about her son's "feminine" behavior.&lt;ref name="bailey16"&gt;Bailey (2003), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey discusses psychologist and sexologist [[Kenneth Zucker]]'s work with children whose parents have noticed significant gender-atypical behaviors.  Bailey uses the anecdote about Danny to describe [[gender identity disorder]], a label applied to males with significant feminine behaviors and females with significant masculine behaviors, such as [[cross-dressing]]. For example, this class includes boys that prefer to play with dolls and regularly identify with female characters in stories or movies, and girls that prefer to play with [[toy car]]s and identify with male characters. This section of the book also discusses some case studies of men who were, for varying reasons, [[sex assignment|reassigned]] to the female sex shortly after their birth, and emphasizes the fact that, despite this, they tended to exhibit typically male characteristics and often identified as men.

The second section deals primarily with gay men, including a suggested link between childhood [[gender identity disorder]] and male homosexuality later in life. Bailey discusses whether homosexuality is a congenitally or possibly even genetically related phenomenon. This discussion includes references to Bailey's studies as well as those of neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]] and geneticist [[Dean Hamer]]. He also discusses the behavior of gay men and its stereotypically masculine and feminine qualities.

In the third section, Bailey summarizes a taxonomy of transsexual women that was proposed by [[Ray Blanchard]] about fifteen years earlier. According to Blanchard, there are two types of transsexual women: one described as an extreme form of male homosexuality, the other being motivated by [[autogynephilia|a sexual interest in having a female body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanchard | first1 = R. | last2 = Clemmensen | first2 = L.

==Reception==
The book elicited both strongly supportive and strongly negative reactions. The controversial aspects included the contents of the book, whether the research was conducted ethically, whether it should have been published by the National Academies Press, and whether it should have been promoted as a scientific work. According to [[Benedict Carey]]'s story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "To many of Dr. Bailey’s peers, his story is a morality play about the corrosive effects of [[political correctness]] on [[academic freedom]]."&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt; Interviewed by Carey, bioethicist [[Alice Dreger]] argues that "what happened to Bailey is important, because the harassment was so extraordinarily bad and because it could happen to any researcher in the field. If we’re going to have research at all, then we’re going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this is what happens to them, then we’ve got problems not only for science but free expression itself."&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;

However, critics such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]] think that the pointed criticism, including filing charges, was warranted: "Nothing we have done, I believe, and certainly nothing I have done, overstepped any boundaries of fair comment on a book and an author who stepped into the public arena with enthusiasm to deliver a false and unscientific and politically damaging opinion".&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;  The concern over academic freedom was dismissed by Charles Allen Moser, who wrote: "The death of free speech and academic freedom has been highly exaggerated. Science is not free of politics, never has been, and never will be."&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;

===Positive reactions===
''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' concluded: "Despite its provocative title, a scientific yet superbly compassionate exposition."&lt;ref name="napsales"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10530 The Man Who Would Be Queen] via [[National Academies Press]].

===Negative reactions from the transgender community===

The public response of members of the transgender community was almost entirely negative.&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt; Among other things, they opposed the book's endorsement of [[Blanchard, Bailey, and Lawrence theory|Blanchard's taxonomy of male-to-female transsexualism]],&lt;ref name="klein2004"&gt;Klein, Julie M.

=== Negative reactions from outside the transgender community ===
Negative responses came from outside the transgender community as well. Liza Mundy of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' thought the book exceptionally dull despite the potentially interesting topic.&lt;ref name="mundy2003"&gt;Mundy, Liza (March 23, 2003). Codes of Behavior. ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Eli Coleman]] referred to the book as "an unfortunate setback in feelings of trust between the transgender community and sex researchers,"&lt;ref name="dreger2008"/&gt; and his colleague, Walter Bockting, wrote that it was "yet another blow to the delicate relationship between clinicians, scholars, and the transgender community."&lt;ref name="bockting2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bockting | first1 = Walter O. | year = 2005 | title = Biological reductionism meets gender diversity in human sexuality. [Review of the book The Man Who Would Be Queen.] | doi = 10.1080/00224490509552281 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 267–270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]] Director [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] said the book promoted a derogatory explanation of transgender identity that would hurt many vulnerable transgender people, and that the book, which was written in a [[popular science]] style, did not support the material in a scientific manner.&lt;ref name="dreger2008"/&gt; Psychologist [[Randi Ettner]] said of Bailey, "He's set back the field 100 years, as far as I'm concerned."&lt;ref name="klein2004" /&gt;

Originally, the [[Lambda Literary Award|Lambda Literary Foundation]] nominated the book as a finalist in the [[transgender]] award category for 2003. Transgender people immediately protested the nomination and gathered thousands of petition signatures in just a few days. Under pressure from the petition, the Foundation withdrew the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2004/03/16/3 |title = Group rescinds honor for disputed book |first = Patrick |last = Letellier |authorlink =  |date = 2004-03-16 |work = Gay.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080505120340/http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2004%2F03%2F16%2F3 |archivedate = 2008-05-05 |accessdate = 2010-01-10 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Northwestern University professor of clinical medical humanities and [[bioethics]] [[Alice Dreger]] commented on Bailey's response to the negative reactions: "Bailey may claim he was not insensitive, but given the number of people he offended with his prose, he is obviously, objectively wrong—being perceived as insensitive by this many people surely means you have been insensitive. (Especially if you don’t get that.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Dreger | first1 = A. D.| title = Response to the Commentaries on Dreger (2008)| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| volume = 37| issue = 3| pages = 503–510| year = 2008| doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9348-7| url = http://bioethics.northwestern.edu/faculty/work/dreger/dreger_commentary_response.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physician [[Charles Allen Moser]], though, believes that Bailey caused his own controversy by being mean spirited. "To call a transsexual who denies Autogynephilia vigorously autogynephilic or an autogynephile-in-denial is also inflammatory and inappropriate. One can convey the same point with more cautious language. In general, researchers should avoid inciting hostility from their subjects. Stating that a subject is in denial or misleading the researcher usually leads to an angry reaction. Ridiculing someone for their beliefs, religious, political, or gender identification is never a good strategy. Ignoring these common courtesies will probably lead to an ugly confrontation, such as this “controversy.” Being a researcher does not confer immunity from the consequences of incivility."&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Charles Moser | title = A Different Perspective | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 |date=June 2008 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9331-3 | pmid = 18431627 | pages=472–475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations against Bailey===

==== Alleged lack of formal written consent in interviews ====
Two of the transsexual women in Bailey's book, two who mistakenly thought they were represented in the book, and several organizations have accused him of ethical breaches in his work by talking to them about their life stories without obtaining formal written consent.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Robin. "Transsexual 'Subjects' Complain About Professor's Research Methods." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' 25 July 2003, Vol. 49, Issue 46. ''"The book contains numerous observations and reports of interviews with me", C. Anjelica Kieltyka, one of the transsexual women, wrote in a letter this month to C. Bradley Moore, Northwestern's vice president for research. She added: "I did not receive, nor was I asked to sign, an informed-consent document."''&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the people were aware that Bailey was writing a book about trans women at the time of the interviews: some of them read the drafts of the book before publication,&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt; and several said they felt their stories had been told "accurately and sympathetically."&lt;ref name="nymag.com"/&gt; Bailey has denied that it is unethical for a university professor to talk to people in the same manner that [[journalist]]s do, or to write books with the resulting anecdotes. He also stated that the book was "popular and not 'scientific'"  so it was not required to follow IRB rules.&lt;ref name="McCarthyism" /&gt;

According to Dreger, whether federal regulations required professors to obtain formal approval from a university [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) before interviewing people was uncertain at the time;&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt; she points out that shortly after publication of this book, the US Department of Health and Human Services, in conjunction with the [[Oral History Association]] and [[American Historical Association]], issued a formal statement that taking [[oral history|oral histories]], conducting interviews, collecting anecdotes, and similar activities do not constitute IRB-qualified research, and were never intended to be covered by clinical research rules, when such work is "neither systematic nor generalizable in the scientific sense."&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OralHistory"&gt;{{Cite book

==== Alleged practice of psychology without a license ====
Also as cited as harassment of Bailey were legal complaints that Bailey was [[practicing psychology without a license]]. The basis for these complaints was that [[sex-reassignment surgery]] in the US requires authorization letters from two psychologists, and Bailey had written a second letter, at no charge and upon request, for some individuals Bailey had spoken with while writing the book. American bioethicist [[Alice Dreger]] notes that there was no legal basis for this claim, as Bailey received no compensation for his services, and was forthright in this letters about his qualifications, even attaching copies of his C.V: "Presumably all this was why [Illinois] never bothered to pursue the charge, although you’d never know that from reading the press accounts, which mentioned only the complaints, not that they had petered out."&lt;ref name="nymag.com"/&gt; State regulators took no action on these complaints.&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;

==Cause==
Trichilemmal cysts are derived from the outer [[root sheath]] of the hair follicle. Their origin is currently unknown, but it has been suggested that they are produced by budding from the external root sheath as a [[genetics|genetically]] determined structural aberration. They arise preferentially in areas of high hair follicle concentrations, therefore, 90% of cases occur on the scalp. They are solitary in 30% of cases and multiple in 70% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=13 September 2017|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1058907-overview|title=Trichilemmal Cyst (Pilar Cyst)|last=Laumann|first=Anne Elizabeth|publisher=[[Medscape]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Histologically]], they are lined by stratified squamous epithelium that lacks a granular cell layer and are filled with compact "wet" keratin.  Areas consistent with proliferation can be found in some cysts. In rare cases, this leads to formation of a tumor, known as a proliferating trichilemmal cyst. The tumor is clinically benign, although it may display [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[atypia]], [[dyskeratosis|dyskeratotic]] cells, and [[mitosis|mitotic]] figures. These features can be misleading, and a diagnosis of [[squamous cell carcinoma]] may be mistakenly rendered.
==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=May 2018}}

== Treatment ==
[[Surgery|Surgical excision]] is required to treat a trichilemmal cyst. The method of treatment varies depending on the [[physician]]'s training. Most physicians perform the procedure under [[local anesthetic]]. Others prefer a more conservative approach. This involves the use of a small [[skin biopsy|punch biopsy]] about 1/4 the diameter of the cyst. The punch biopsy is used to enter the cyst cavity. The content of the cyst is emptied, leaving an empty sac. As the pilar cyst wall is the thickest and most durable of the many varieties of cysts, it can be grabbed with [[forceps]] and pulled out of the small incision. This method is best performed on cysts larger than a pea which have formed a thick enough wall to be easily identified after the sac is emptied. Small cysts have walls that are thin, and easily fragmented on traction. This increases the likelihood of cyst recurrence. This method often results in only a small scar, and very little if any bleeding.

'''Tympanostomy tube''', also known as a '''grommet''' or '''myringotomy tube''', is a small tube inserted into the [[eardrum]] in order to keep the [[middle ear]] aerated for a prolonged period of time, and to prevent the accumulation of fluid in the middle ear.  The operation to insert the tube involves a [[myringotomy]] and is performed under local or [[general anesthesia]]. The tube itself is made in a variety of designs.  The most commonly used type is shaped like a [[grommet]].  When it is necessary to keep the middle ear ventilated for a very long period, a "T"-shaped tube may be used, as these "T-tubes" can stay in place for 2–4 years.  Materials used to construct the tube are most often [[plastics]] such as [[silicone]] or [[Teflon]].  [[Stainless steel]] tubes exist, but are no longer in frequent use.

==Medical uses==
[[Image:Typmanostomy tubes, permanent style, 2006-2011 (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Tubes of a more permanent style, unlike those typically used in the [[United States]]. These tubes remained in place for four years until one spontaneously left the ear drum. The other was removed with tweezers after having partially disengaged from the ear drum. The removal process can cause significant pain for several minutes.]] 
Guidelines state that tubes are an option in:

* Recurrent acute otitis media: three ear infections in six months or four infections in a year.&lt;ref name=Peads2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieberthal|first1=AS|last2=Carroll|first2=AE|last3=Chonmaitree|first3=T|last4=Ganiats|first4=TG|last5=Hoberman|first5=A|last6=Jackson|first6=MA|last7=Joffe|first7=MD|last8=Miller|first8=DT|last9=Rosenfeld|first9=RM|last10=Sevilla|first10=XD|last11=Schwartz|first11=RH|last12=Thomas|first12=PA|last13=Tunkel|first13=DE|title=The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media.|journal=Pediatrics|date=March 2013|volume=131|issue=3|pages=e964-99|pmid=23439909|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-3488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence for this recommendation; however, is weak.&lt;ref name=Peads2013/&gt;
* Chronic [[otitis media]] with persistent effusion for six months (one ear) or three months (both ears).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
* Persistent [[eustachian tube]] dysfunction{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
* [[Barotrauma]]: Especially for prevention of recurrent episodes (e.g., after air travel, [[hyperbaric chamber]] treatment).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Procedure==
Although myringotomy with tube insertion can be performed under [[local anesthesia]] during a regular doctor's appointment in co-operative adults, patients requiring tube insertion are very often young children. Since damage to the ear is possible unless the patient stays quite still while being manipulated, any patient who may have difficulty lying still during the procedure typically undergoes myringotomy and tube insertion under general anesthesia.

The insertion of tympanostomy tubes is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on children. In the [[United States]], it is the most common reason for a child to undergo a general anesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Vaile L. Williamson T. Waddell A. Taylor G. ''Interventions for ear discharge associated with grommets (ventilation tubes)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
[[File:Ear Tube.png|thumb|120 px|left|Ear tube]]
Tympanostomy tubes generally remain in the [[eardrum]] for six months to two years, with T-tubes lasting up to four years. They generally spontaneously fall out of the eardrum as the skin of the eardrum slowly migrates out towards the ear canal wall over time. The eardrum usually closes without a residual hole at the tube site but in a small number of cases a perforation can persist. There is debate among clinicians as to whether long-lasting tubes are associated with a higher incidence of adverse outcomes, such as persistent perforation, cholesteatoma, tympanosclerosis and others, as opposed to tubes designed to last for shorter durations.

A common complication of getting a tympanostomy tube is experiencing [[Otitis media#Otorrhea: infected drainage from the middle ear|otorrhea]], which is a discharge from the ear.&lt;ref name="AANfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery |author1-link = American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery]] |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-otolaryngology-head-and-neck-surgery-foundation// |accessdate = August 1, 2013}}, which cites

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3645">'''Vicente Salias''' (March 23, 1776 &amp;ndash; September 17, 1814) was a [[Venezuela]]n doctor, journalist, and writer who wrote Venezuela's "[[Gloria al Bravo Pueblo]]" "Glory to the Brave People." national anthem. Born in [[Puerto Cabello]], [[Carabobo]] on March 23, 1776.

==Family==
Salias' parents were Francisco Salias Tordesillo and María Margarita Sanija Cabeza de Vaca. He had four siblings and the names were Juan Marino, Carlos Pedro and Francisco Salias who fought for the emancipation movement. All perished during the struggle except Francisco.
He enrolled in [[philosophy]] courses in the [[Universidad Central de Venezuela]], University of [[Caracas]] on September 18, 1788. Three years later he took several courses in Law, which he dropped out a year later.

Still pursuing much more academic achievement during high school, he enrolled in medicine and his mentor during this time was [[Felipe Tamariz]], who was an important influence in shaping a future scholar. He graduated from high school with a degree in [[Philosophy]] and a year later earned another degree in medicine, all of this was before going to college. In that same year, he enrolls as a medical student and begins his illustrious career in medicine.

His biggest contributions were his articles 1804 and 1805 on [[Small Pox]] Vaccination.

He was the founder and leader of the Patriotic Society of Caracas (Sociedad Patriotica de Caracas). Following the events of the [[:es:Revolución del 19 de abril de 1810|Revolution of April 19, 1810]] where Salias and his brothers participated activelly, the commanding General and other colonial officials designated by [[Joseph Bonaparte]] to oversee the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]], were deposed by an expanded municipal government in Caracas that called itself: the [[Supreme Junta]] to Preserve the Rights of Ferdinand VII (''La Suprema Junta Conservadora de los Derechos de Fernando VII''). One of the first measures of revolutionaries was to send diplomatic missions abroad to seek support and recognition of the Supreme Junta of Caracas as the legitimate councilor of Venezuela in the absence of the King.  Salias along with [[Mariano Montilla]] were sent by the Junta to [[Jamaica]] and [[Curaçao]] to spread the news about revolutionaries events in Venezuela.In charged of the Ministry of Finance, and collaborated with General [[Francisco de Miranda]] during the [[First Republic of Venezuela]]. He was captured by the Spaniards and was transferred to the castle of Puerto Cabello and [[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]], which then was released 1813.

Salias fought alongside [[Simon Bolivar]], Venezuela's liberator, and in the year 1814 he was captured and executed in the Castle of San Felipe. His last words were "God Almighty if in the Heavens they admit the Spaniards, then I renounce to the Heavens!".
