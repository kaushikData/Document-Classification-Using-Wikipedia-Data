The '''African Wildlife Defence Force''' ('''AWDF'''; ''Afrika Wildsweermag'' ([[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]),  ''Force pour la d√©fense de la faune sauvage Africaine'' ([[French language|French]]), ''For√ßa de defesa da vida selvagem Africana'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), ''Kikosi cha ulinzi ya wanyama pori barani Afrika'' ([[Swahili language|Swahili]]), ''ÈùûÊ¥≤ÈáéÁîüÂãïÁâ©Èò≤Ë°õËªç'' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]], traditional), ''ÈùûÊ¥≤ÈáéÁîüÂä®Áâ©Èò≤Âç´ÂÜõ'' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]], simplified)) is a private elite park ranger and anti-poaching organization based in [[Dungu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Dungu]], in the north-east of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. AWDF uses direct action tactics to protect wild life and rainforests. The organization was founded in 2012 by Jean Kiala, a horticulturist and forester. It serves as an alternative to regular park ranger organizations who struggle with corruption, and seeks to eliminate the increasing levels of violence which poachers face.

==History==
The AWDF was found in 2012 after founder Jean Kiala travelled through Africa and visited orphanages, private game ranches, conservancies and national parks in countries such D.R. Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and South Sudan. He was disappointed because, in his mind, the outside world was not doing enough to help the parks in central Africa. After he had conducted ground surveys on the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan, and had been contracted on a private ranch in South Africa, he decided to train a team of Congolese rangers.

Two years later, he saw the need for a more specialized task force. And so, as of April 2014, the AWDF began with the selection of candidate rangers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Kenya and South Africa for training of Advanced Force (AFR) and Special Force (SFR) rangers. Founder Jean Kiala approached a former French Legionnaire in aim of providing a type of training that follows the tenets of the Special Forces and certain wildlife management courses.

==Organization==
The AWDF is a non-profit African private ranger organization; 80% of the organization's revenue is spent on its programs, while 20% of revenue is spent on administration and fundraising. It is supported by private and corporate donations, internet advertising and grants. The group is operated by both paid rangers and volunteers. The organization is committed to staying small, by operating with a few Special Operations Task Forces only. The AWDF is governed by a board of directors, including Jean Kiala. The board has several advisers, each addressing an area of expertise. The board consist of an Environmental Scientist, an Anthropologist, a Law Enforcement Advisor and a Financial and Management Advisor. They provide services from Anti-poaching, Wildlife management, Forestry management and Agroforestry consulting. But also Ranger training, Close quarter training and specialist rural security services.

The AWDF is open to all African citizens except for people from countries located north of the Sahel. They refuse African expats from outside Africa for ranger functions, this in order to draw radicalized candidates. In general non-Africans, foreigners coming from outside Africa can only work as an instructor or scientist.

==Traditions of the AWDF==
The AWDF rangers wear their insignia on the left side of the beret, to distinguish themselves from the regular park ranger organizations.

===Honor code of the guardian===
*Art. 1 - Guardian, you are a volunteer, serving African wildlife with honor and fidelity.
*Art. 2 - Each guard is your brother in arms whatever his nationality, race or religion. You maintain a close solidarity and unity with members as one family.
*Art. 3 - Respectful of traditions, honor your superiors, discipline and comradeship are your strength; courage and loyalty are your virtues.
*Art. 4 - Proud of your guardian status, proud of your elegant outfit, modest in behaviour, responsible for keeping barracks clean. 
*Art. 5 - Elite Guard; you train rigorously, you maintain your weapon as your most precious, you maintain a good level of fitness. 
*Art. 6 - The mission is sacred; you will carry it to the end and if necessary, risk your life.
*Art. 7 - In combat, you act without passion or hatred, you respect the defeated enemy, you will never forsake your dead, nor your wounded, or your weapons.

==Working field==
As a private ranger services contractor the AWDF focusses on wildlife conservation and rainforest conservation. The AWDF has the expertise to also intervene in mangroves, lakes and waterways but does not work at sea. Their major working field is central Africa in the parks located in the border region of Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Uganda and Central African Republic. This is because of the different rebel groups that infest the parks in this region. The AWDF want to increase its presence in Africa by sending rangers to locations in Chad, Cameroon, Kenya, Tanzania, Namibia and South Africa. In the establishment of the AWDF it was recorded that the parks in central, eastern and southern Africa are prioritized for intervention. The AWDF does not send rangers to north Africa. And in west Africa they only send rangers to Mali and Nigeria. The AWDF does not accept unsolicited proposals.

==Departments==

===Convention on African Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna (CATES)===
The working group was formed in protest against what the AWDF calls the disastrous policies of [[CITES]]. The group works on wildlife law enforcement and promote non-conventional livestock farming like [[Insect farming]], [[Crocodile farming]] and [[Game farming]]. They also examine the pros and cons of rhino horn farming.

===Rangers===
*'''Rangers'''. The R or rangers are trained in Basic Military Training and Wildlife Management courses. An R conducts patrols also with a guard dog. Rangers can specialize in the sniffer dog unit.
*'''Advanced Force Rangers'''. The AFR or Advanced Force Rangers are an elite ranger force in the AWDF, consisting of Parachute/Commando units. It is a support-reconnaissance unit. The training consists of 15 weeks of physical and psychological endurance. In addition to physical conditioning, the Advanced Forces learn hand-to-hand combat, survival techniques, military tactics, map reading and radio transmission. Followed by a 4 weeks wildlife management course and wildlife capturing course. Mutation to SFR is possible after five years experience as an AFR.


*'''Special Force Rangers'''. The SFR or Special Force Rangers are a special forces unit in the AWDF. Members of the SFR are selected from the AFR units of the AWDF. After the main Advanced Forces course, a Special Forces operator will train three specialities. These are free fall from high altitude HAHO/HALO, underwater fighting skills and operating in mountainous terrain. Also, they all have to choose a team speciality: communications, explosives, armament, medical training or sniper. In real situations, the Special Force Rangers have to perform reconnaissance and surveillance missions in small groups deep into enemy territory, enact small offensive actions to arrest people, or to sabotage or impound materials. They are also trained to gain intelligence disguised as a civilian.
*'''Special Operations Affiliate Ranger Group'''. The SOARG are a special forces unit in the AWDF. Members of the SOARG are coming from various elite groups around the world. Most are US veterans working Pro-Bono for a short or long-term basis.

'''Weapons'''
*[[Remington Model 700]]
*[[AK-47]] The AWDF is considering to replace its AK-47 by both [[M16 rifles]] and the [[FAL SA58 mini OSW rifle]] from [http://www.dsarms.com/ DS Arms].
*[[Glock 17]]

===Aviation===
The AWDF is working on establishing its own air wing. It is working together with small flight operators from [[Bangui M'Poko International Airport]], [[Goma International Airport]] and [[Wau Airport]] where it leases [[Cessna 206]] aircraft.

===Tree nursery===
The AWDF focusses on the conservation of the rainforest from the basin of the Congo which has 70% of Africa's plant cover. The Congo Rainforest in Central Africa makes up a large portion of Africa's biodiversity with over 600 tree species and 10,000 animal species. The AWDF decided to start a nursery for ''Wild Edible Plants (WEP) &amp; Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP)'' and ''Tropical Hardwood''. Scientists have begun collecting seeds and planting materials to start a nursery.

*'''Wild Edible Plants (WEP) &amp; Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP)'''. The AWDF want to guarantee food security by promoting ''agro-forestry'' and ''food forestry'' reforestation projects in central Africa and therefore created a list of 300 plants and tree species of the Congo that qualify for multiplication.
*'''Tropical Hardwood'''. Because of the greed of China (Anno 2014) for forest exploitation and mead by the fact that since 1960 there was rarely replanted. The AWDF also created a list of 150 tree species for multiplication to avoid the alienation and destruction of the rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;Koninkrijk Belgie, Ministerie van Kolonien.

==Actions==

=== Hungerstrike ===
On 13 August 2014, director Jean Kiala flew to [[Burbank, California]] to do a [[hunger strike]]. The goal was to get media attention in Hollywood for his cause and try to appear in the [[Ellen show]]. After sending 2500 emails and over 350 letters to celebrities, without having received any reply, he decided to talk with workers of [[Animal Defenders International]] (ADI) in Los Angeles. He was also invited by Rhino zoo keeper and Anti-Poaching Ranger Mike Daniels to visit the [[San Diego Zoo Safari Park]] and to look behind the scenes. On invitation of Matt Rossell, (ADI) Campaigns Director, a dinner took place with actress and animal activist [[Georja Umano]]. Later he also met the actress and editor ''Moon Hi Hanson''. Because he was barely noticed as backpacking among the hundreds of homeless in LA and because the media was not interested to listen to his story, he decided to return on September 27, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Photos trip to Hollywood https://www.facebook.com/AfricanWildlifeDefenceForceAwdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quest for Joseph Kony====
Since 2012 a team of rangers is deployed near the border of Bengangai Game Reserve, Bire Kpatous Game Reserve and Mbarizunga Game reserve of neighboring country South Sudan to quest the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) of [[Joseph Kony]].&lt;ref&gt;''Interpol warrant Joseph Kony'' http://www.interpol.int/notice/search/wanted/2006-26320&lt;/ref&gt; The reward of up to $5m offered by the US State Department for information leading to the arrests or conviction of LRA leaders Joseph Kony, Okot Odhiambo, and Dominic Ongwen was the motivation to start this mission. But until today the Ugandan warlord could not be found. The rangers are protecting nature reserves in the region and support efforts to protect civilians.

'''Anti-nationalism''' denotes the sentiments associated with an opposition to [[nationalism]]. The imposition of nationalism as a belief or identity system, particularly when in conflict with more established and self-sustaining identity choices, often based on freely chosen religious or cultural beliefs and practices can be understood to undermine the legitimacy of territory-based nationalism. Various forms of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] propose alternatives. They do not all necessarily oppose the concepts of [[country|countries]], [[nation state]]s, [[border|national boundaries]], cultural preservation, and [[identity politics]]; for example, present-day [[multilateralism]] does not, whereas [[proletarian internationalism]] and various kinds of [[cosmopolitanism]] explicitly do so.

Some anti-nationalists oppose all types of nationalism, including [[ethnic nationalism]] among oppressed [[minority group]]s. Variations on this theme are often seen in [[Marxism|Marxist theory]]. Marx and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] rejected nationalism as a whole, stating that, "the working men have no country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nationalism: A Critical Introduction |author1=Philip Spencer |author2=Howard Wollman |publisher=SAGE |year=2002 |pages=8‚Äì9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Trotskyists, however, such as [[Chris Harman]], were critical of nationalism while advocating support for what they saw as progressive national struggles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1992/xx/natquest.htm#f12 The Return of the National Question] by Chris Harman, a Trotskyist analysis and critique of nationalism.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
[[Anarchism]] has developed a [[Anarchism and nationalism|critique of nationalism]] that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power, domination, and wealth. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]], such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and ''The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism'' by Fredy Perlman.Detroit, Black &amp; Red Publishers, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Aphorisms on the Wisdom of Life'', [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] rejects nationalism, seeing it as an abandonment of personal identity.&lt;ref name=morality&gt;{{cite book |title=The Morality of Nationalism |editor1=Robert McKim |editor2=Jeff McMahan |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=1997 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZxJQqx8W52wC&amp;pg=121&amp;dq=Schopenhauer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his clarifying work, ''Ecce Homo'', [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] unequivocally denounces nationalism in the strongest terms, describing it as "this most ''anti-cultural'' sickness and unreason there is, nationalism, this ''nervose nationale'' with which Europe is sick, this perpetuation of European particularism, of ''petty'' politics...a dead-end street."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nietzsche|first1=Friedrich|title=On the Genealogy of Morals and Ecce Homo|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-679-72462-1|pages=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[S√∏ren Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy is a criticism and vehement rejection of Christian nationalism.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;''Kierkegaard's Critique of Christian Nationalism'', Stephen Backhouse. Oxford University Press, 2011 (pg. 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

The charge of being 'anti-national' is common in [[India]]. Like in the West, there has been a revival of nationalist sentiment in 21st century India. This takes the form of non-sectarian [[Indian nationalism]] and also exclusionary [[Hindu nationalism]]. 

According to G. Sampath in ''[[The Hindu]]'', Adivasis in central India, Dalit students, Left intellectuals, human rights activists, a certain religious minority [Islam], anti-nuclear activists, beef eaters, non-haters of Pakistan, inter-religious couples, homosexuals, and labour activists have all been labelled 'anti-national'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/Who-is-an-anti-national/article14082785.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells rejects patriotism and nationalism in this intentionally provocative talk, speaking of his great desire for a future 'world unity' where barriers between countries are dissolved. While acknowledging his own great pride in being an Englishman, Wells decries both the increasing nationalism that is plaguing the world and the march towards war, a catastrophe that many believe is now inevitable, while still hoping for peace and co-operation if the courage and imagination can be found."

[[File:Butterfield Bank in Georgetown, Grand Cayman.jpg|thumb|right|The Cayman Islands is a leading [[Cayman Islands#Financial services industry|financial services centre]].]]
{{Insolvency}}
'''Cayman Islands bankruptcy law''' is principally codified in five statutes and statutory instruments:
* the Bankruptcy Law (1997 Revision)
* the Companies Law (2013 Revision)
* the Companies Winding Up Rules 2008 (as amended) 
* the Insolvency Practitioners' Regulations 2008 (as amended)
* the Foreign Bankruptcy Proceedings (International Cooperation) Rules 2008
These are supplemented by a number of practice directions of the Cayman Islands courts and a wide body of case law.

Most of the recent emphasis of [[bankruptcy law]] reform in the [[Cayman Islands]] relates to corporate insolvency rather than personal bankruptcy.  As an [[offshore financial centre]], the Cayman Islands has more [[offshore company|resident companies]] than citizens, and accordingly the courts a large amount of time dealing with corporate insolvency and reorganisation.  Because a large number of Cayman Islands are listed on stock exchanges in major financial centres, and number of Cayman Islands corporate bankruptcies have generated a high profile internationally.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: {{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/ldk-solar-usa-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-20141021-00543|title=LDK Solar USA Files Chapter 11 Bankruptcy|publisher=NASDAQ.com|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bankruptcy of individuals is usually referred to as "[[personal bankruptcy]]" in the Cayman Islands, whereas the bankruptcy of corporations is referred to as "[[corporate insolvency]]".  The relevant statutes deal with both separately, although there are some provisions which are common to both.

==Personal bankruptcy==

A single creditor or two or more creditors who are owed an amount not less than CI$40 may present a petition to the court against a debtor for a declaration of bankruptcy if the debtor has committed one or more "acts of bankruptcy".&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Law, section 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  An act of bankruptcy means:
# the debtor has made a general assignment of his property to a trustee or trustees for the benefit of creditors;
# the debtor has made a [[fraudulent conveyance]] of any part of his property;
# the debtor has attempted to defeat or delay his creditors by leaving the Cayman Islands, or begun to sell his stock-in-trade at an undervalue;
# the debtor has declared himself unable to meet his engagement;
# the debtor has presented the bankruptcy petition himself;
# execution against the debtor on any legal process has been levied by seizure and sale of his goods; 
# the creditor has served on the debtor a bankruptcy notice (loosely akin to a statutory demand) requiring payment of a sum of not less than CI$40 which was not satisfied within seven days;
# the debtor has not satisfied a judgment debt of not less than CI$40 within seven days;
# the debtor has not paid an obligation on a [[negotiable instrument]] of not less than CI$40 within 14 days;
# the debtor has made of conveyance which would be void as a fraudulent conveyance if he was adjudged bankrupt;
# that the debtor has, in the ''Gazette'' and in a local newspaper, given notice of his intention to transfer his stock-in-trade, debts or things in action relating to his business to any other person; and that the creditor presenting the petition has served on the debtor a bankruptcy notice in writing requiring him to pay the amount of such debt, and that the debtor has not paid within seven days; or
# that the debtor has paid money to or given or delivered any satisfaction or security for the debt of a petitioning creditor, or any part thereof, after such creditor has presented a bankruptcy petition against him.
But it is a requirement that:
# the alleged act of bankruptcy must have occurred within six months before the presentation of the petition;
# the debt of the petitioning creditor must be a liquidated sum due or growing due at law or in equity, and must not be a [[secured debt]];
# any person who is, for the time being, entitled to enforce a final judgment shall be deemed a creditor who has obtained a final judgment within the meaning of the Law; and
# where any debtor is absent from the Cayman Islands, any act done or suffered by any agent or manager of the debtor managing any property, which, if such agent or manager were the owner of the property or business, would have constituted an act of bankruptcy available against such person, shall, in all cases, be deemed to have been expressly authorised by the debtor and shall be available as an act of bankruptcy against the debtor unless the authority of the agent or manager shall be shown to have been exceeded.

==Winding up of companies==

A company may enter [[liquidation|winding up]] either voluntarily, or pursuant to an order of the court.  If a company enters voluntary winding up then the directors are required to make a determination of solvency.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 123(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Any person (including a former director of the company) may act as liquidator in a solvent voluntary winding up.  However, if the directors are not able to make a determination of solvency, or if upon the application of a creditor to the court it is shown that either (a) the company is or is likely to become insolvent; or (b) the supervision of the Court will facilitate a more effective, economic or expeditious liquidation of the company in the interests of the contributories and creditors, then the court may order the winding up be subject to the supervision of the court, and in such cases a licensed insolvency practitioner must be appointed as liquidator.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to voluntary liquidation, a company may be wound up by the court if:&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the company has passed a special resolution requiring the company to be wound up by the court;
# the company does not commence its business within a year from its incorporation, or suspends its business for a whole year;
# the period, if any, fixed for the duration of the company by the articles of association expires, or whenever the event, if any, occurs, upon the occurrence of which it is provided by the articles of association that the company is to be wound up;
# the company is unable to pay its debts; or
# the court is of opinion that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up.

A company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if:&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 93.&lt;/ref&gt;
# a creditor in a sum exceeding CI$100, has served a statutory demand on the company, and the company has failed to pay the sum within 21 days;
# execution of other process issued on a judgement is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; or
# it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts.

Although the reference in the legislation to a company being unable to pay its debts appears to be a clear reference to cash-flow insolvency, case law in the Cayman Islands makes it clear that the court may order the winding up of a company under this heading on the basis of balance sheet insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Awal Finance Company'' [2011] (1) CLR 487&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquidation is a class right, and so the court will not normally make an order upon the application of a creditor if it is opposed by a majority of creditors.&lt;ref&gt;''Re ABC Coupler Engineering'' [1961] 1 WLR 243&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] is appointed, his duty to is collect in all of the assets of the company, liquidate them and pay or provide for the claims of the company's creditors ''[[pari passu]]''.&lt;ref name="Companies Law, section 1401"&gt;Companies Law, section 140(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  After the order for winding up is made, or when a [[provisional liquidator]] is appointed, no suit, action or other proceedings may be proceeded with or commenced against the company except with the leave of the court; where such an order has been made, any attachment, distress or execution put in force against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up is void.&lt;ref name="s97"&gt;Companies Law, section 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  This provision does not appear to affect a purely voluntary winding up.

At the conclusion of the winding up the company is dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 151 and 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liquidation committees===

In almost all compulsory liquidations, the liquidator is required to establish a liquidation committee.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Winding Up Rules 2008, order 9(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  The committee of a company being wound up will be elected at the first meeting of the relevant stakeholders after commencement of the liquidation.  The committee is supposed to give guidance to the liquidator in relation to the wishes of the stakeholders in relation to the conduct of the liquidation.

The membership of the committee will be determined by whether the liquidator determines that the company is solvent, insolvent or of doubtful solvency.  If the liquidator determines that the company is solvent then the committee must comprise not less than three and not more than five shareholders.  If the company is insolvent the committee must comprise not less than three and not more than five creditors.  If the company has been certified as of doubtful solvency the committee must comprise not less than three and not more than six members, a majority of whom must be creditors but at least one of which must be a shareholder.  In the event that the liquidator's initial certification as to the solvency/insolvency of the company changes during the course of the liquidation, the membership of the committee will similarly change so as to properly represent the stakeholders in the liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harneys.com/files/cayman-liquidation-committees---what-prospective-members-need-to-know---5817534.pdf|title=Cayman Liquidation Committees ‚Äì What Prospective Members Need to Know|publisher=[[Harney Westwood &amp; Riegels|Harneys]]|accessdate=15 November 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Case law has now made it clear that it no longer has any ability (by way of its inherent jurisdiction or otherwise) to make directions with respect to the composition of a liquidation committee (other than to dispense with a committee altogether in appropriate circumstances).&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;''Re Herald Fund SPC (In Official Liquidation)'' FSD 27/13, Grand Court (unreported), 28 January 2014. {{cite web|url=http://www.walkersglobal.com/Lists/News/Attachments/422/0214-Formation%20and%20composition%20of%20liquidation%20committees.pdf|title=The Court‚Äôs power in relation to the formation and composition of liquidation committees|publisher=[[Walkers (law firm)|Walkers]]|date=4 February 2014|accessdate=15 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128185942/http://www.walkersglobal.com/Lists/News/Attachments/422/0214-Formation%20and%20composition%20of%20liquidation%20committees.pdf|archivedate=28 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an application to dispense with the requirement to establish a liquidation committee, the court will look to the reasons why a liquidation committee cannot be formed in compliance with the Companies Winding Up Rules.  Importantly, where a liquidator's determination with respect to the solvency of a company is the sole reason why a compliant committee cannot be formed, it appears that the court may look behind a liquidator's summary determination and examine the methodology used to reach that determination.&lt;ref name="Herald" /&gt;

==Priority of claims==

In liquidation the assets of the insolvent company will be distributed according to the following order of priority:
# property which is subject to valid [[security interest|fixed security interests]] will be reserved to the secured creditors benefiting from that security;&lt;ref name="s142"&gt;Companies Law, section 142(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
# payment of the liquidation expenses;&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 109(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
# payment of [[Preferential creditor|preferred debts]];&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 141(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
# payment of claims secured by a [[floating charge]];&lt;ref name="s141"&gt;Companies Law, section 141(2)(b)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Priority between liquidation expenses and floating chargeholders is still determined by the rule in ''[[Buchler v Talbot]]'' [2004] UKHL 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
# payment of the ordinary unsecured creditors;
# payment of contractually [[Subordinated debt|subordinated creditors]];&lt;ref name="s140(2)"/&gt;
# payment of creditors whose claims derive through shares in the company by way of dividends or redemption proceeds;&lt;ref&gt;''Culross Global SPC Limited v Strategic Turnaround'' [2010] UKPC 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
# payment of post-liquidation interest on any debts;&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 149(2).&lt;/ref&gt; and
# any balance is returned to the shareholders in accordance with their entitlements under the articles of association.&lt;ref name="Companies Law, section 1401"/&gt;

Preferential claims are set out in schedule 2 to the Companies Law, and broadly encompass employee's claims, sums due to governmental or quasi-governmental bodies in the Cayman Islands, and sums due to depositors by a bank.  The Companies Law does not make express provision for the position of a crystallised floating charge,&lt;ref&gt;Contrast, for example, the definition of a "floating charge" in section 251 of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] (UK), which provides that a floating charge includes any charge which was created as a floating charge, ie. it is still treated as a floating charge for priority purposes after crystallisation.&lt;/ref&gt; and accordingly it seems arguable that when a floating charge crystallises upon the making of a wind-up order, the position of the floating security holder should change to that of a fixed charge holder.

==Set-off and subordination==

Where a company goes into winding up, and the company has any claims against a creditor proving in the liquidation, an account is taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and the sums due from one party shall be set-off against the sums due from the other.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 140(3).&lt;/ref&gt;  Only the balance, if any, of the account taken shall be provable in the liquidation or, as the case may be, payable to the liquidator as part of the assets.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 140(5).&lt;/ref&gt;

This right of insolvency set-off is subject to (a) the rights of the secured creditors and the preferred creditors, (b) any contractual rights of subordination, and (c) any contractual netting arrangements.&lt;ref name="s140(2)"&gt;Companies Law, section 140(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the company has entered into any netting agreements in relation to financial contracts, the contractual netting provisions shall prevail over the statutory set-off rights.&lt;ref name="s140(2)" /&gt;  This includes netting agreements which provide for multilateral set-off.

==Secured creditors==

A creditor who has the benefit of a valid [[security interest]] can enforce their security at any time - the granting of an order for winding up of a company does not stay a secured creditor's rights.&lt;ref name="s142" /&gt;  If the secured creditor has a security interest which is only a floating charge, then although the making of a winding up order does not stay the rights of the floating charge holder, because the claims secured by the floating charge are subordinated to the claims of the preferred creditors,&lt;ref name="s141" /&gt; in practice the secured creditor is unlikely to enforce his rights unless it is clear that there are sufficient assets available to the liquidator to pay all of the preferred claims.

==Restructuring==

Under Cayman Islands law there is no formal debtor-in-possession form of rehabilitation for companies in financial distress.  However, under the Companies Law, a company may enter into a [[scheme of arrangement]] and reorganise its debts if the scheme is supported by a majority of creditors holdings 75% in value of the company's debt.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Cayman Islands it is quite common for a scheme of arrangement to be supported by an application by the company for the appointment of a provisional liquidator to give the company breathing space from its creditors in order to seek consent for and implement the scheme.  Upon the making of an order for provisional liquidation, no proceedings may be commenced or continued with against the company,&lt;ref name="s97" /&gt; although this does not affect the right of secured creditors to enforce their security.&lt;ref name="s142" /&gt;  Although the appointment of a provisional liquidator is intended to be a remedy to prevent fraudulent dissipation of the company's assets, the use of such orders to support restructuring through schemes of arrangement has now becomes widespread market practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkersglobal.com/Lists/News/Attachments/138/%28Cayman%29%20Schemes%20of%20Arrangement%20-%20Procedure.pdf|title=Cayman Islands - Schemes of Arrangement - Procedure|publisher=[[Walkers (law firm)|Walkers]]|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voidable transactions==

Under Cayman Islands law, there are two principal avoidance regimes in relation to transactions entered into during the onset of insolvency: (a) voidable preferences, and (b) dispositions at an undervalue.

Every conveyance or transfer of property or money which is made by a company in favour of a creditor at a time when the company is unable to pay its debts with a view to giving such creditor a preference over the other creditors shall be if made within six months immediately preceding the commencement of a liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 145(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  For these purposes the requirement to show an intention to give a preference is to be viewed in line with accepted common law authorities, such as ''[[Re MC Bacon Ltd (No 1)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1990] BCLC 324&lt;/ref&gt;  There company must have been insolvent at the time of giving the preference, but the giving of the preference which caused the company to subsequently become insolvent will not trigger the provision.  If the preference is a payment in favour of a "related party" (a creditor shall be treated as a "related party" if it has the ability to control the company or exercise significant influence over the company in making financial and operating decisions) then it is deemed to have been made for the purposes of giving a preference.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 145(2) and (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, every disposition of property made at an undervalue by or on behalf of a company with intent to defraud its creditors shall be voidable at the instance of its official liquidator.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 146.&lt;/ref&gt;  The burden of establishing an intent to defraud for the purposes of this section shall be upon the official liquidator.  The relevant disposition must have occurred not more than six years prior to the application of the official liquidator.  There are no specific provisions protected ''bona fide'' transferees for value without notice, but where a transfer to such a party is set aside then the transferee shall have a first and paramount charge over the property, the subject of the disposition, of an amount equal to the entire costs properly incurred by the transferee in the defence of the action or proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 146(5).&lt;/ref&gt;

Any disposition of a company's property and any transfer of shares or alteration in the status of the company's members made ''after'' the commencement of the winding up is void unless the court otherwise orders, where the winding up is pursuant to a court order.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Law, section 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Cayman Islands law there is no general power vested in a liquidator to disclaim onerous or unprofitable contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Contrast the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] (UK), section 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insolvency practitioners==

Insolvency practitioners are regulated under the Insolvency Practitioners' Regulations, 2008 (as amended).  Under the regulations a person shall only be qualified to accept appointment by the court as official liquidator of any company if:&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Practitioners' Regulations, regulation 4(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
# he is licensed to act as an insolvency practitioner in a relevant country; or
# he is qualified as a professional accountant by an approved institute, is in good standing with such institute, has a minimum of five (5) years' relevant experience and is credited with not less than 2,500 chargeable hours of relevant work; or
# he has previously been appointed by the court as an official liquidator of a company at any time within the five years immediately preceding the regulations coming into force.
For these purposes the relevant countries are (a) England and Wales; (b) Scotland; (c) Northern Ireland; (d) The Republic of Ireland; (e) Australia; (f) New Zealand; and (g) Canada.

Moreover, an otherwise qualified insolvency practitioner shall not be appointed by the court as official liquidator of any company unless (a) he is resident in the Cayman Islands; and (b) he, or the firm of which he is a partner or employee, holds a trade and business licence which authorises him or his firm to carry on business as professional insolvency practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Practitioners' Regulations, rule 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

All licensed insolvency practitioners must be insured up to the minimum amount of professional indemnity cover.&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Practitioners' Regulations, rule 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-border insolvency==

[[Cross-border insolvency]] is largely regulated under the Foreign Bankruptcy Proceedings (International Cooperation) Rules 2008.  In practice the Cayman Islands courts seek to cooperate with foreign courts and bankruptcy officials to ensure the efficient administration of insolvent estates.

The '''Church of Greece''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|·ºòŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒØŒ± œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºôŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ}}}}, ''Ekklis√≠a tis Ell√°dos'' {{IPA-el|ekliÀàsia tis eÀàla√∞os|}}), part of the wider [[Greek Orthodox Church]], is one of the [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] churches which make up the communion of [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Christianity]]. Its canonical territory is confined to the borders of [[Greece]] prior to the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912‚Äì1913 ("Old Greece"), with the rest of Greece (the "New Lands", [[Crete]], and the [[Dodecanese]]) being subject to the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. However, most of the dioceses of the Metropolises of the New Lands are ''de facto'' administered as part of the Church of Greece for practical reasons, under an agreement between the churches of Athens and Constantinople. The [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] of the Church of Greece is the [[Archbishop of Athens and All Greece]].

==Prevailing religion of Greece==
[[File:Greek flags and emblem at church.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Greek Orthodoxy is the prevailing religion of Greece, emphasised by displays of the Greek flag and national emblem.]]

Adherence to the [[Orthodox Church]] was established as a definitive hallmark of Greek ethnic identity already in the first modern Greek constitution, the "[[Greek Constitution of 1822|Epidaurus Law]]" of 1822, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The [[preamble]] of all successive Greek constitutions simply states "In the name of the Holy, Consubstantial and Indivisible Trinity", and the ''Orthodox Church of Christ'' is established as the "prevailing" religion of Greece.

Mainstream Orthodox clergy's salaries and pensions are paid for by the State at rates comparable to those of teachers. The Church had previously compensated the State by a tax of 35% on ordinary revenues of the Church, but ''Law 3220/2004'' in 2004 abolished this tax. By virtue of its status as the prevailing religion, the [[canon law]] of the Church is recognized by the Greek government in matters pertaining to church administration.  This is governed by the "Constitution of the Church of Greece", which has been voted by Parliament into law.  Religious marriages and baptisms are legally equivalent to their civil counterparts and the relevant certificates are issued by officiating clergy.  All Greek Orthodox students in primary and secondary schools in Greece attend religious instruction. Liaisons between church and state are handled by the [[Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs (Greece)|Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs]].

Supreme authority is vested in the synod of all the diocesan bishops who have [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] status (the '''Holy Synod of the Church of Greece''', [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|·ºπŒµœÅ·Ω∞ Œ£œçŒΩŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºòŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒØŒ±œÇ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºôŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ}} ''Hier√† S√Ωnodos t√™s Ekklƒìs√≠as t√™s Hell√°dos'' {{IPA-el|ieÀàra Ààsino√∞os tis ekliÀàsias tis eÀàla√∞os|}}) under the ''[[de jure]]'' presidency of the [[Archbishop of Athens]] and all Greece. This synod deals with general church questions. The Standing Synod is under the same presidency, and consists of the Primate and 12 bishops, each serving for one term on a rotating basis and deals with details of administration.

The church is organised into 81 dioceses. 36 of these, located in northern Greece and in the major islands in the north and northeast Aegean, are nominally and spiritually under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], which retains certain privileges over and in them‚Äîfor example, their bishops have to acknowledge the Patriarch as their own primate during prayers. They are called the "New Lands" (ŒùŒ≠Œ±Œπ ŒßœéœÅŒ±Œπ, or ''N√©ai Ch≈çrai'') as they became part of the modern Greek state only after the [[Balkan Wars]], and are represented by 6 of the 12 bishops of the Standing Synod. A bishop elected to one of the Sees of the New Lands has to be confirmed by the Patriarch of Constantinople before assuming his duties.  These dioceses are administered by the Church of Greece "in stewardship" and their bishops retain their right of appeal (the "''√©kklƒìton''") to the Patriarch.

The dioceses of [[Crete]] ([[Church of Crete]]) and the [[Dodecanese]], and the [[Mount Athos|Monastic Republic of Holy Mount Athos]] remain under the direct jurisdiction of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]; they are not part of the Church of Greece.  The [[Church of Crete|Archdiocese of Crete]] in particular enjoys semiautonomous status: new bishops are elected by the local Synod of incumbents, and the Archbishop is appointed by the Ecumenical Patriarchate from a three-person list (the ''tripr√≥s≈çpon'') drawn by the Greek [[Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs (Greece)|Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs]] from among the incumbent Metropolitans of Crete.

==Clergy and monastics==
As in other Orthodox Churches, male graduates of seminaries run by the church (and financed by the Greek State), may be ordained as deacons and eventually priests. They are allowed to marry before their ordination as deacons, but not afterwards. The vast majority of parish clergy in Greece are married. Alternatively, they may enter monasteries and/or take monastic vows. Monastics who are ordained as priests, and possess a university degree in theology, are eligible as candidates for the episcopate ([[archimandrite]]s). Women may also take monastic vows and become [[nun]]s, but they are not ordained.

Monasteries are either affiliated to their local diocese, or directly to one of the Orthodox Patriarchates; in the latter case they are called "Stauropegiac" monasteries (''Stayropƒìgiak√°'', "springs of the Cross").

==Old Calendarists==
{{Main|Greek Old Calendarists}}
A split (schism) occurred within the Church in 1924 when the Holy Synod decided to replace the Old Calendar ([[Julian Calendar|Julian]]) with a hybrid calendar‚Äîthe so-called "Revised Julian Calendar"‚Äîwhich maintained a modified Julian dating method for Easter while adopting the [[Gregorian Calendar]] date for fixed feasts. Those who refused to adopt this change are known as [[Old Calendarists]] (''palaioimerologites'' in Greek) and still follow the old Julian Calendar. They themselves have suffered several schisms, and not all Old Calendarists comprise one Church. They refer to themselves as "[[Greek Old Calendarists|Genuine Orthodox Christians]]", and the largest group associating itself with the Old Calendarists is the Synod of Archbishop [[Chrysostomos II Kioussis]]. This Synod has obtained government recognition as a valid Orthodox Church, although this is not in communion with the Church of Greece or the other [[Orthodox Church]]es.

Greece was an [[Early centers of Christianity#Greece|early center of Christianity]]. Upon formation of the [[Patriarchate]], the Church was formerly a part of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]].  Under Ottoman rule, the Muslims had no control over the church. With the establishment of the Greek kingdom, however, the government decided to take control of the church, breaking away from the patriarch in Constantinople.  The government declared the church to be [[autocephalous]] in 1833 in a political decision of the Bavarian Regents acting for [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]], who was a minor. The decision roiled Greek politics for decades as royal authorities took increasing control.  The new status was finally recognized as such by the Patriarchate in 1850, under compromise conditions with the issue of a special "Tomos" decree which brought it back to a normal status. As a result, it retains certain special links with the "[[Ecumenical Patriarchate|Mother Church]]".  There were only four bishops, and they had political roles.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Scott Latourette, '' Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, II: The Nineteenth Century in Europe: The Protestant and Churches.'' (1959) 2: 479-481&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1833 Parliament dissolved 400 small monasteries having fewer than five monks or nuns. Priests were not salaried; in rural areas they were peasant farmers themselves, dependent for their livelihood on their farm work and from fees and offerings by parishioners. Their ecclesiastical duties were limited to administering the sacraments, supervising funerals, the blessings of crops, and exorcism. Few attended seminaries. By the 1840s, there was a nationwide revival, run by traveling preachers. The government arrested several and tried to shut down the revival, but it proved too powerful when the revivalists denounced three bishops for purchasing their office. By the 1880s the "Anaplasis" ("Regeneration") Movement led to renewed spiritual energy and enlightenment. It fought against the rationalistic and materialistic ideas that had seeped in from secular Western Europe. It promoted catechism schools, and circles for the study the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Latourette, '' Christianity in a Revolutionary Age'' (1959) 2: 481-83&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th-century religious revival was led by the Zo√´ movement, which was founded in 1911. Based in Athens but operating in decentralized fashion, it reached a membership of laymen as well as some priests. The main activities include publications and the nationwide Sunday School movement in 7800 churches reaching 150,000 students. Zo√´ sponsored numerous auxiliaries and affiliated groups, including organizations for professional men, youth, parents, and young women nurses. A strong effort was made to circulate Bibles, illustrated novels, pamphlets, and other religious materials. A liturgical movement encouraged the laity to a greater awareness in the Eucharist, and more frequent Communion.&lt;ref&gt;Demetrios J. Constantelos, The ''Zo√´ Movement in Greece," ''St. Vladimir's Seminary Quarterly'' (1959) vol 3 pp 1-15 [http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/arhu/content/docs/djc%20archive/The%20Zoe%20Movement%20in%20Greece.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt; Seminaries were built in the 20th century, but most of the graduates entered teaching rather than parish work. In 1920, only 800 of Greece's 4500 priests had any education beyond the elementary level. By 1959, out of 7000 priests no more than five percent had completed university and seminary training. Monastic life declined sharply, although it continued at remote [[Mount Athos]].  Routine church life was highly disrupted by the Second World War and subsequent civil war, with many churches burned, and hundreds of priests and monks killed by the Germans on the one hand or the Communists on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Latourette, '' Christianity in a Revolutionary Age'' (1961) 4: 523-27&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Church of Spiritual Technology''' ('''CST''') is a [[California]] 501(c)(3) [[non-profit corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:IRS-Recognition-Denmark.djvu|Letter by the Internal Revenue Service to Flemming Paludan, Regional Director, Danish Tax-Office, Washington, D.C., USA, December 22nd, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated in 1982, which owns all the [[copyright]]s of the estate of [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and licenses their use. CST [[trade name|does business as]] '''L. Ron Hubbard Library'''.&lt;ref name="scnfaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/faq/church-management/what-is-church-of-spiritual-technology.html|title=What is Church of Spiritual Technology?|publisher=[[Church of Scientology]]|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1993 memorandum by the [[Church of Scientology International]], the role and function of CST has been described as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] CST [...] is an autonomous church of the Scientology religion outside the international Scientology ecclesiastical hierarchy. CST conducts an extensive program of activities to preserve and archive the Scientology Scriptures for use by future generations. CST also owns the option to acquire RTC's rights to the Scientology advance[d] technology and religious marks under three narrowly defined sets of circumstances, each of which contemplates a serious threat to continued existence of the religion. CST is the principal beneficiary of Mr. Hubbard's estate, provided that it obtains recognition of its tax-exempt status. [...]" &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Summary Description CST-AT-ASI.pdf|Summary Description of Other Scientology Organizations - CST (Church of Spiritual Technology), Author's Family Trust, ASI (Author Services Inc.) - CSI Prod. 11-4-93, Bate Stamp: 151412 - 151413, Ex. 1-8, Washington, DC 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Corporate information ==

The Church of Spiritual Technology (CST) was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] by Sherman Lenske in Woodland Hills, [[California]] on May 27, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:CST-Incorporation.djvu|Articles of Incorporation of Church of Spiritual Technology, Endorsed Filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of California, Woodland Hills, California, May 27th, 28th &amp; June 1st, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bylaws]] of CST were signed on June 7, 1982 by its General and Special [[Board of directors|Directors]], who were at that time Lyman Spurlock, Rebecca Pook, Maria Starkey, Stephen A. Lenske, Sherman D. Lenske and Lawrence A. Heller.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Bylaws-CST.pdf|Bylaws of Church of Spiritual Technology, California, June 7th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; In 1986, CST's [[Articles of Incorporation]] were amended to clarify the "[[disposition]] of the [[corporation|corporation's]] [[assets]] upon [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]]".&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Amended Articles of Incorporation CST.pdf|Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation - Church of Spiritual Technology, Endorsed filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of California, Bate Stamp: 02008 - 02009, California, April 9th, May 13th &amp; 14th, 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt;'''= --&gt;
On August 18, 1993, CST filed an application for [[tax exemption]] under section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;!-- [[:File:Application-501-CST.pdf|Form 1023 - Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code - Church of Spiritual Technology, Washington, DC, August 18th, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; The [[Internal Revenue Service]] granted CST's request for exemption through an official recognition letter on October 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Image:IRS-Recognition-CST.pdf|Recognition Letter for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status - Church of Spiritual Technology, Washington, DC, October 1st, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the filing for [[tax exemption]], the following individuals held [[corporate]] positions at CST: The [[Board of Trustees]] was composed of John Allcock, David Lantz and Russell Bellin. Thomas Vorm, Russell Bellin and Catherine Schmidt formed the [[Board of Directors]]. CST's [[President (corporate title)|President]] was Russell Bellin, its [[Vice-President]] Thomas Vorm, its [[Secretary]] Jane McNairn and its [[Treasurer]] Catherine Schmidt.

===Licensing of trademarks and service marks===
[[File:IRS-CST-Denial-Letter.pdf|thumb|left|July 8, 1988 [[IRS]], final adverse ruling letter with regards to application for tax exempt status of Church of Spiritual Technology]]

The existence and founding of CST is intimately connected to the creation of the [[Religious Technology Center]], which was incorporated on January 1, 1982. Shortly after its inception, RTC received on May 16, 1982 "the ownership, supervision and control" of the [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]], identifying "Scientology applied religious philosophy" and "Dianetics spiritual healing technology" by the originator and founder of Scientology, [[L. Ron Hubbard]] through a so-called "[[Assignment (law)|Assignment]] [[Contract|Agreement]]".&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Assignment-RTC.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, County of Los Angeles, California, May 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

This agreement was subject to an additional "Option Agreement" between Hubbard, RTC and CST.  In two so-called "Option Agreements" from May 1982, Hubbard granted CST the right to purchase at any time from RTC the "Marks", the "Advanced Technology" and all the rights to them for the sum of $100.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST.pdf|"Option Agreement (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, County of Los Angeles, California, May 10th, 1982/July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST-AT.pdf|Option Agreement (Advanced Technology-U.S.) - Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, California, May 10th &amp; July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Parallel and similar-sounding agreements between Hubbard, RTC and CST were created during that period concerning the so-called "Advanced Technology," which consists of unpublished derivates of Scientology's confidential "Advanced technology".&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Assignment-Agreement-LRH-RTC-AT.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Advanced Technology - US)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, Los Angeles, California, May 10th &amp; 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Under these agreements, RTC is forced to turn over 90% of its net income to CST. A document from 1991, reflecting the "financial money flows" of RTC during the year 1989, actually showed a turnover of 59% of RTC's net income towards CST.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Analysis-Financial-Flows-RTC.pdf|"Religious Technology Center - Analysis of Financial Flows 1989", Exhibit I-9 for Application for Tax-Exempt Status 501(c)(3), Bate Stamp: CSI Prod 11-4-93 151414]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Other examples of [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]] owned by CST are [[The Way to Happiness]] and The Way to Happiness symbol. As such, CST operates as the L. Ron Hubbard Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.twth.org/reprinting/files/reprint-instructions.pdf |format=PDF| title = How to obtain permission to reprint The Way to Happiness booklets | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | publisher = The Way to Happiness Foundation International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facility locations ==
CST operates numerous bases throughout the western United States.  Locations include:

=== Twin Peaks, California ===
As of 1988, this property has 15 buildings totaling approximately 22,000 square ft, including a three-story administration office, dormitories, dining halls, residences and other buildings and offices. The originals are kept here, with copies made for other vault locations. [[Shelly Miscavige]], wife of leader David Miscavige, who hasn't been seen in public since 2007, is said to be held at this location.

=== Creston, California (Creston Ranch / Whispering Winds Ranch) ===
While not a vault location, the Creston Ranch, where L. Ron Hubbard died, is marked with the CST logo.

=== Triple Jay Ranch, California ===

=== Petrolia, California (Sunset View / Eureka) ===
The usage for the property is an archival document storage repository there which will store religious documents preserved by CST.
=== Tuolumne, California (Lady Washington Mine) ===
Located at 18749 First Avenue, Tuolumne serves as archival storage for the writings of L Ron Hubbard.  The Lady Washington Mine and two houses on 26.23 acres were purchased in 1988 by William and Donna Daniels. In 1988, the Daniels gave the property to Norman Starkey, trustee of "Author's Family Trust". Starkey gave the property to the Church of Spiritual Technology in 1993. Digging began in 1997. According to the Los Angeles Times, the CST "is using state-of-the-art technology to protect Hubbard's writings, tape-recorded lectures and filmed treatises from natural and man-made calamities, including nuclear holocaust."

According to plans filed with the Tuolumne County Building Department the facility features a 15-foot-wide, 250-foot-long-tunnel. The first 98 feet from the entrance are improved, with a 10.5-foot domed ceiling. At the end of the 98 feet is a 10-foot-long storage room. 

=== Trementina, New Mexico (San Miguel Ranch / Trementina Base) ===
According to CST, the purpose of this base is to provide storage space for an archiving project to preserve Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Scientology bibliography|writings]], [[Scientology filmography|films]] and recordings for future generations. Hubbard's texts have been engraved on stainless steel tablets and encased in titanium capsules underground. The project began in the late 1980s.

The base includes a number of dwellings and the archives themselves, the latter in a network of underground tunnels. The base also has its own private, concrete airstrip, the San Miguel Ranch Airport (NM53).

The site is about a 2 1/2-hour drive east of Santa Fe. Access is through a gated road and a private concrete airstrip, the San Miguel Ranch Airport (NM53). The Trementina location is supposedly a store for material written by L.R. Hubbard, as shown in 1998 on ABC News's "20/20.":

"Buried deep in these New Mexico hills in steel-lined tunnels, said to be able to survive a nuclear blast, is what Scientology considers the future of mankind," ABC's Tom Jarriel said in his report. "Seen here for the first time, thousands of metal records, stored in heat-resistant titanium boxes and playable on a solar-powered turntable, all containing the beliefs of Scientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard."

The site is marked from the air with Church of Spiritual Technology double diamonds. A runway for smaller airplanes is located on CST owned land in connection to the site. The original short strip was expanded in the early 1990s on land acquired by a land swap deal between CST and neighboring land owners in 1992.

==Archives==
The CST oversees the Scientology scriptural archiving project, which aims to preserve the works of Hubbard on stainless steel tablets and encased in [[titanium]] capsules in specially constructed [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Bob | last = Henderson | title = Vault to get Hubbard's writings | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/50647275.html?dids=50647275:50647275&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | work =  | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 1991-07-25 | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of Hubbard's works go through a rigorous process, beginning with the [[Mass deacidification|removal of deterioration-causing acid from the paper]], and then being placed in plastic envelopes. They are then placed in the titanium "time capsules." The writings are also carved into stainless steel plates, which, according to Church of Scientology officials, can withstand being sprayed with salt water for a thousand years. Hubbard‚Äôs taped lectures are recorded again into gold compact discs encased in glass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientologysided062490-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church places prime value to Hubbard‚Äôs volumes of works and because of this has instituted the CST to ‚Äúengrave the entire corpus of Hubbard‚Äôs original texts on steel plates.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Cowan 2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowan |first1=Douglas |last2=Bromley |first2=David |title=Cults and New Religions: A Brief History |chapter=Wiley Blackwell Brief Histories of Religion |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2015 |accessdate=2015-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example is the [[Trementina Base]], an underground vault built into a mountainside near [[Trementina, New Mexico]]. It is marked by a CST logo visible only from a high altitude and was built in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/26/AR2005112601065.html | title=A Place in the Desert for New Mexico's Most Exclusive Circles | publisher=Washington Post | date=November 27, 2005 | accessdate=July 11, 2012 | author=Leiby, Richard | pages=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Anderson| last = Cooper| authorlink = Anderson Cooper | title = Inside the Church of Scientology| url = http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0512/02/acd.01.html| format = Transcript | work = [[Anderson Cooper 360¬∞]]| publisher = CNN | date = 2005-12-02 | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former members claim that the purpose of CST's archival efforts is to ensure that Hubbard's work survive a [[nuclear apocalypse]] and reform civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/07/scientology_shelly_miscavige_disappeared.php Scientology Leader David Miscavige's Disappeared Wife Shelly: What We Know], ''The Village Voice'', 5 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/02/scientologys_se.php Scientology's Secret Vaults: A Rare Interview With a Former Member of Hush-Hush "CST"], ''The Village Voice'', 6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The church believes that these plates will last beyond a thousand years and that Hubbard‚Äôs teachings will be vital for "rebuilding civilization," in the event of global turmoil.&lt;ref name="Cowan 2015"/&gt; Former members of the church also claim that the symbols in the logo are ‚Äúguide markers for Scientologists returning from other parts of the universe," according to ''Scientology in Popular Culture: Influences and Struggles for Legitimacy.''

According to the Scientology website, the Church of Spiritual Technology ‚Äúis not involved in the ecclesiastical management of Scientology churches or the delivery of Scientology religious services. Its day-to-day activities are the long-term archival preservation methods to ensure that Mr. Hubbard‚Äôs written recorded works will be preserved for future generations.‚Äù The website also states that the archive‚Äôs purpose is to make available L. Ron Hubbard‚Äôs technology ‚Äúin its exact and original form, no matter what happens to the society.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=J. |title=Handbook of Scientology |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The very first time the Church of Spiritual Technology was mentioned publicly to Scientologists was by COB RTC David Miscavige in 2000 at the New Year's event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freezone.najbjerg.info/dokumenter/the-new-year-2000-event?set_language=en New Year 2000 event speech excerpt, by D.Miscavige]&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders included [[Meade Emory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/seattletimes/obituary.aspx?n=george-meade-emory&amp;pid=145944048 | title=George Meade Emory Obituary | publisher=Seattle Times | date=October 12, 2010 | accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-Scientologist who used to work for the [[Internal Revenue Service]] but went into private practice as a tax lawyer. He was hired as a specialist for the complex Internal Revenue Codes. The Church of Scientology International and most Scientology organizations settled with the IRS about 11 years later when the service passed a resolution in 1993 declaring the Church tax-exempt.

Other Scientology organizations require all corporate officers to be Scientologists in good standing, along with Scientologist general directors and staff. The Church of Spiritual Technology, however, includes "Special Directors" who are not required to be Scientologists, but who are required to be lawyers "to ensure that CST takes no action to jeopardize its tax-exempt status" (CST vs. IRS, US Claims Court No. 581-88T, June 29, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/blog/suleiman2/cst_vs_irs_1992.html CST vs. IRS - United States Claims Court, June 29 1992&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Prague clementinum entrance.jpg|thumb|220px|East entrance of the Clementinum]]
The '''Clementinum''' (''Klementinum'' in [[Czech language|Czech]]) is a historic complex of buildings in [[Prague]]. Until recently the complex hosted the National, University and Technical libraries; the City Library was also nearby on Mari√°nsk√© N√°mƒõst√≠. In 2009, the Technical library and the Municipal library moved to the [[Prague National Technical Library]] at Technick√° 6.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguerealestate.cz/the-magic-of-the-national-technical-library-a-building-for-the-new-generation-clanek_200809022/ The Magic of the National Technical Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116055359/http://www.praguerealestate.cz/the-magic-of-the-national-technical-library-a-building-for-the-new-generation-clanek_200809022/ |date=16 November 2011 }} at Prague Real Estate&lt;/ref&gt; It is in use as the [[National Library of the Czech Republic]]. In 2005, the Czech National Library received the [[UNESCO]] [[Jikji prize]] (Memory of the World).

==History==
{{See also|Charles_University_in_Prague#History|l1=History of Charles University in Prague}}
[[Image:Prague from Klementinum.jpg|thumb|left|230px|View of Prague from Clementinum]]
Its history dates from the existence of a [[chapel]] dedicated to Saint Clement in the 11th century. A Dominican [[monastery]] was founded in the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], which was transformed in 1556 to a [[Jesuit]] college. In 1622 the Jesuits transferred the [[library]] of [[Charles University]] to the Klementinum, and the college was merged with the University in 1654. The Jesuits remained until 1773, when the Klementinum was established as an [[observatory]], library, and university by the Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]].

The National Library was founded in 1781 and from 1782 the Clementinum was a [[legal deposit]] library. In 1918 the newly established [[Czechoslovakia|Czecho-Slovak state]] took over the library. Since 1990, it has been the National Library. It contains a collection of [[Mozart]]iana, material pertaining to [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Comenius]], as well as historic examples of [[Czech literature]]. The [[architecture]] is a notable example of [[Baroque architecture]] and Clementinum, covering 20,000 square metres, is the second largest complex of buildings in Prague after the [[Prague Castle]].
For several years before 2006, there was an ongoing debate on the possibilities of expanding the space for future library collections, as space in the current Clementinum buildings was expected to reach its limit by 2010. On Jan 10, 2006, the Prague authorities decided to sell the city-owned property located in the area of [[Letn√°]] near the Prague center, to the National Library. In Spring 2006, an international [[architectural design competition]] for the new building was put up. An architect who won the competition is Jan Kaplick√Ω, but his winning was infirmed, so the Czech National Library is still waiting for its final project.

==Curiosities==
[[Image:Clementinum library2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Baroque library hall]]
*At one time the Clementinum was known as the third largest [[Jesuit]] college in the world.
* The oldest weather recording in the area of the [[Czech lands]] started in Clementinum in the year 1775. The recording continues through the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chmi.cz/meteo/ok/klemhiste.html|title=Brief History of Meteorological Measurements|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Czech Hydrometeorological Institute|accessdate=5 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424024956/http://www.chmi.cz/meteo/ok/klemhiste.html|archivedate=24 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Clementinum is mentioned in "[[The Secret Miracle]]" by [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. The main character has a dream of the library of Clementinum where the librarians look for God in the books of the library. One of the librarians says: ''God is in one of the letters of one of the pages of one of the four hundred thousand books of Clementinum. My fathers and the fathers of my fathers have looked for this letter; I myself have gone blind looking for it''. So, a reader enters and delivers an [[atlas]] for the main character, saying that this atlas is useless. The main character opens the book at random, and find a map of [[India]], touching one of its minimum letters and, then, finds [[God]].
* The Baroque library hall inside Clementinum is known for its beautiful interior, including ceiling artwork by Jan Hiebl.

The word '''contraband''', reported in English since 1529, from Medieval French ''contrebande'' "a smuggling," denotes any item that, relating to its nature, is illegal to be possessed or sold.

It is used for goods that by their nature are considered too dangerous or offensive in the eyes of the legislator (termed '''contraband in se''') and forbidden. So-called '''derivative contraband''' refers to goods that may normally be owned, but are liable to be seized because they were used in committing an unlawful act and hence begot illegally:
* [[smuggling]] goods
* stolen goods ‚Äì knowingly participating in their trade is an offense in itself, called [[Fence (criminal)|fencing]]
* the fruits of [[fraud]], [[forgery]] etc.

The word is also used as an adjective, again meaning 'distributed or sold illicitly'.

==Law of armed conflict==
[[File:Contraband weapons in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Contraband weapons seized by an Afghan and coalition security force during an offensive security operation in [[Nangarhar Province|Nangarhar]].]]

In [[international law]], contraband means goods that are ultimately destined for territory under the control of the enemy and may be susceptible for use in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[San Remo Manual]] on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=October 1995 |page=148 |others=International Committee of the Red Cross |ISBN=9780521558648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, contraband is classified into two categories, '''absolute contraband''' and '''conditional contraband'''. The former category includes arms, munitions, and various materials, such as chemicals and certain types of machinery that may be used directly to wage war or be converted into instruments of war.

Conditional contraband, formerly known as occasional contraband, consists of such materials as provisions and livestock feed. Cargo of that kind, presumably innocent in character, is subject to seizure if in the opinion of the belligerent nation that seizes them, the supplies are destined for the armed forces of the enemy rather than for civilian use and consumption. In former agreements among nations, certain other commodities, including soap, paper, clocks, agricultural machinery and jewelry, have been classified as non-contraband, but the distinctions have proved meaningless in practice.

Under the conditions of modern warfare, in which armed conflict has largely become a struggle involving the total populations of the contending powers, virtually all commodities are classified by belligerents as absolute contraband.

==American Civil War Enslaved People==
{{Main|Contraband (American Civil War)}}
During the [[American Civil War]], [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]]-owned [[slaves]] who sought refuge in Union military camps or who lived in territories that fell under Union control were declared "contraband of war". The policy was first articulated by [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|General Benjamin F. Butler]] in 1861, in what came to be known as the "Fort Monroe Doctrine," established in [[Hampton, Virginia]]. By war's end, the Union had set up 100 contraband camps in the South, and the [[Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony]] (1863‚Äì1867) was developed to be a self-sustaining colony.&lt;ref name="learnNC"&gt;[http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-civilwar/4590 "The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony"], provided by National Park Service, at North Carolina Digital History: LEARN NC, accessed 11 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Many adult freedmen worked for wages for the Army at such camps, teachers were recruited from the North for their schools by the [[American Missionary Association]], and thousands of [[freedmen]] enlisted from such camps in the [[United States Colored Troops]] to fight with the Union against the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;For further information on the use of the term "contraband" in the Civil War, see [http://mac110.assumption.edu/aas/intros/contrabands.html "Northern Visions of Race and Reform"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20100213050420/http://mac110.assumption.edu/aas/intros/contrabands.html |date=2010-02-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaties==
Numerous treaties defining contraband have been concluded among nations. In time of war, the nations involved have invariably violated the agreements, formulating their own definitions as the fortunes of war indicated. The [[Declaration of London]], drafted at the London Naval Conference of 1908‚Äì1909 and made partly effective by most of the European maritime nations at the outbreak of World War I, established comprehensive classifications of absolute and conditional contraband. As the war developed, the lists of articles in each category were constantly revised by the various belligerents despite protests by neutral powers engaged in the carrying trade. By 1916, the list of conditional contraband included practically all waterborne cargo. Thereafter, for the duration of [[World War I]], nearly all cargo in transit to an enemy nation was treated as contraband of war by the intercepting belligerent, regardless of the nature of the cargo. A similar policy was inaugurated by the belligerent powers early in [[World War II]].

==Neutral nations==
Under international law, the citizens of neutral nations are entitled to trade, at their own risk, with any or all powers engaged in war. No duty to restrain contraband trade is imposed on the neutral governments, but no neutral government has the right to interfere on behalf of citizens whose property is seized by one belligerent if it is in transit to another. The penalty traditionally imposed by belligerents on neutral carriers engaged in commercial traffic with the enemy consists of confiscation of cargo. By the Declaration of London, it was extended to include condemnation of the carrying vessel if more than half the cargo was contraband. The right of warring nations to sink neutral ships transporting contraband is not recognized in international law, but the practice was initiated by Germany in World War I and was often resorted to by the [[Axis Powers]] in World War II.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

A '''criminal accusation''' is the process of declaring one's [[belief]] in another's [[Legal liability|liability]] for that other's [[Crime|criminal]] action(s).  A criminal [[wikt:accusation|accusation]] may be informally made through a declaration made to the public at large (generally through news media) or by the filing of a formal accusation in a court of law by a person legally entitled to do so, generally on behalf of the state by a [[criminal]] [[prosecutor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11991">[[Image:DeCSS.svg|right|thumb|A fragment of the DeCSS code, which can be used by a computer to circumvent a DVD's [[copy protection]].]]

'''DeCSS''' was one of the first free [[computer programs]] capable of decrypting content on a commercially produced [[DVD]] video disc.  Before the release of DeCSS, [[Linux]]-based computing systems could not play video DVDs.

DeCSS's development was done without a license from the [[DVD Copy Control Association]] (CCA), the organization responsible for DVD [[copy protection]]‚Äînamely, the [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS) used by commercial DVD publishers.  The release of DeCSS resulted in a Norway criminal trial and subsequent [[acquittal]] of one of the authors of DeCSS. The DVD CCA launched numerous lawsuits in the United States in an effort to stop the distribution of the software.

== Origins and history ==

DeCSS was devised by three people, two of whom remain anonymous. It was released on the [[Internet]] mailing list [[LiViD]] in October 1999. The one known author of the trio is [[Norway|Norwegian]] programmer [[Jon Lech Johansen]], whose home was raided in 2000 by Norwegian police. Still a teenager at the time, he was put on trial in a Norwegian court for violating Norwegian Criminal Code section 145,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Norwegian Criminal Code section 135-147 | url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-017.html | accessdate=31 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and faced a possible jail sentence of two years and large fines, but was acquitted of all charges in early 2003. On 5 March 2003, a Norwegian appeals court ruled that Johansen would have to be retried. The court said that arguments filed by the prosecutor and additional evidence merited another trial. On 22 December 2003, the appeals court agreed with the acquittal, and on 5 January 2004, Norway's [[√òkokrim]] (Economic Crime Unit) decided not to pursue the case further.

The program was first released on 6 October 1999 when Johansen posted an announcement of DeCSS 1.1b, a [[Proprietary software|closed source]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-only application for DVD [[ripping]], on the livid-dev mailing list. The [[source code]] was leaked before the end of the month. The first release of DeCSS was preceded by a few weeks by a program called DoD DVD Speed Ripper&lt;ref name="The Truth about DVD CSS cracking"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Truth about DVD CSS cracking |author=MoRE and [dEZZY/DoD] |date= 4 November 1999 |url=http://www.lemuria.org/DeCSS/dvdtruth.txt |accessdate=4 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from a group called [[DrinkOrDie]], which didn't include source code and which apparently did not work with all DVDs. Drink or Die reportedly [[disassembler|disassembled]] the [[object code]] of the [[Xing Technology|Xing]] DVD player to obtain a player key. The group that wrote DeCSS, including Johansen, came to call themselves Masters of Reverse Engineering and may have obtained information from Drink or Die.&lt;ref name="The Truth about DVD CSS cracking"/&gt;

The CSS decryption source code used in DeCSS was mailed to Derek Fawcus before DeCSS was released. When the DeCSS source code was leaked, Fawcus noticed that DeCSS included his css-auth code in violation of the [[GNU General Public License|GNU GPL]]. When Johansen was made aware of this, he contacted Fawcus to solve the issue and was granted a license to use the code in DeCSS under non-GPL terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Derek Fawcus ending livid-dev flamewar by confirming Johansen's side of the story | url=http://livid.on.openprojects.net/pipermail/livid-dev/1999-October/000548.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001202051300/http://livid.on.openprojects.net/pipermail/livid-dev/1999-October/000548.html | archivedate=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2004, the [[DVD Copy Control Association|DVD CCA]] dropped the case against Jon Johansen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=EFF: DVD Descrambling Code Not a Trade Secret |url=http://w2.eff.org/IP/Video/DVDCCA_case/20040122_eff_pr.php |date=22 January 2004 |work=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=5 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jon Lech Johansen's involvement===
The DeCSS program was a collaborative project, in which Johansen wrote the [[graphical user interface]]. The transcripts from the [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]], published in the Norwegian newspaper ''[[Verdens Gang]]'', contain the following description of the process which led to the release of DeCSS:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/pub/vgart.hbs?artid=206926 |title=Hele DVD-dommen |trans-title=The entire DVD verdict |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |date=22 December 2003 |accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Through Internet Relay Chat (henceforth IRC), [Jon Lech Johansen] made contact with like-minded [people seeking to develop a DVD-player under the [[Linux]] operating system]. 11 September 1999, he had a conversation with "mdx" about how the encryption algorithm in CSS could be found, by using a poorly secured software-based DVD-player. In a conversation [between Jon Lech Johansen and "mdx"] 22 September, "mdx" informs that "the nomad" had found the code for CSS decryption, and that "mdx" now would send this [code] to Jon Lech Johansen. "The nomad" allegedly found this decryption algorithm through so-called [[reverse engineering]] of a Xing DVD-player, where the [decryption] keys were more or less openly accessible. Through this, information that made it possible [for "mdx"] to create the code CSS_scramble.cpp was retrieved. From chat logs dated 4 November 1999 and 25 November 1999, it appears that "the nomad" carried through the reverse engineering process on a Xing player, which he characterized as illegal. As the case is presented for the High Court, this was not known by Jon Lech Johansen before 4 November [1999].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Regarding the authentication code, the High Court takes for its basis that "the nomad" obtained this code through the electronic mailing list LiVid (Linux Video) on the Internet, and that it was created by Derek Fawcus. It appears through a LiVid posting dated 6 October 1999 that Derek Fawcus on this date read through the DeCSS source code and compared it with his own. Further, it appears that "the creators [of DeCSS] have taken [Derek Fawcus' code] almost verbatim - the only alteration was the removal of [Derek Fawcus'] copyright header and a paragraph containing commentaries, and a change of the function names." The name [of the code] was CSS_auth.cpp.

The High Court takes for its basis that the program Jon Lech Johansen later programmed, the graphical user interface, consisted of "the nomad's" decryption algorithm and Derek Fawcus' authentication package. The creation of a graphical user interface made the program accessible, also for users without special knowledge in programming. The program was published on the Internet for the first time 6 October 1999, after Jon Lech Johansen had tested it on the movie "The Matrix." In this,  he downloaded approximately 2.5%. 200 megabytes, of the movie to the hard drive on his computer. This file is the only film fragment Jon Lech Johansen has saved on his computer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Technology and derived works ==
{{See also|libdvdcss}}
When the release of the DeCSS source code made the CSS algorithm available for public scrutiny, it was soon found to be susceptible to a [[brute force attack]] quite different from DeCSS. The encryption is only [[40-bit encryption|40-bit]], and does not use all keys; a high-end home computer in 1999 running optimized code could [[brute force attack|brute-force]] it within 24 hours, and modern computers can now{{when|date=September 2017}} brute-force it in a few seconds or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Kesden/index.html|title=Content Scrambling System (CSS): Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmers around the world created hundreds of programs equivalent to DeCSS, some merely to demonstrate the trivial ease with which the system could be bypassed, and others to add DVD support to [[open source]] movie players. The licensing restrictions on CSS make it impossible to create an open source implementation through official channels, and closed source drivers are unavailable for some operating systems, so some users need DeCSS to watch even legally obtained movies.

== Legal response ==

The first legal threats against sites hosting DeCSS, and the beginning of the DeCSS mirroring campaign, began in early November 1999 (''[[Universal v. Reimerdes]]''). The preliminary injunction in ''[[DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. v. Bunner]]'' followed soon after, in January 2000. As a response to these threats a program also called DeCSS but with an unrelated function was developed. This program can be used to strip [[Cascading Style Sheets]] tags from [[HTML]] pages. In one case, a school removed a student's webpage that included a copy of this program, mistaking it for the original DeCSS program, and received a great deal of negative media attention.&lt;!--ref name-"pigdog"; read sources before stamping--&gt; The CSS stripping program had been specifically created to bait the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] in this manner.&lt;ref name="pigdog"&gt;{{cite web | title=Pigdog Journal - DeCSS Distribution Center | url=http://www.pigdog.org/decss/ | accessdate=28 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In protest against legislation that prohibits publication of copy protection circumvention code in countries that implement the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]] (such as the [[United States]]' [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]), some have devised clever ways of distributing descriptions of the DeCSS algorithm, such as through [[steganography]], through various Internet protocols, on T-shirts and in dramatic readings, as [[MIDI]] files, as a [[haiku]] poem ([[DeCSS haiku]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to decrypt a DVD - in Haiku form |first=Seth |last=Schoen |url=http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Gallery/decss-haiku.txt |accessdate=5 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The history of the DeCSS Haiku |first=Seth |last=Schoen |url=http://www.loyalty.org/~schoen/haiku.html |accessdate=25 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even as a so-called [[illegal prime|illegal prime number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gallery of CSS Descramblers |first=David S. |last=Touretzky |authorlink=David S.

In international law, '''diplomatic protection''' (or '''diplomatic espousal''') is a means for a state to take diplomatic and other action against another state on behalf of its national whose rights and interests have been injured by that state. Diplomatic protection, which has been confirmed in different cases of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] and the [[International Court of Justice]], is a discretionary right of a state and may take any form that is not prohibited by international law. It can include consular action, negotiations with the other state, political and economic pressure, judicial or arbitral proceedings or other forms of peaceful dispute settlement.

In 2006, the [[International Law Commission]] adopted the [[Articles on Diplomatic Protection]], regulating the entitlement and the exercise of diplomatic protection.

==History==

Diplomatic protection traces its roots to the eighteenth century. The idea that a state has a right to protect its subjects who are abroad has been expressed by [[Emmerich de Vattel]] in his ''Law of Nations'': "Whoever ill-treats a citizen indirectly injures the State, which must protect that citizen." Since this protection could take any form whatsoever, the doctrine has often been misused by Western powers as a pretext to intervene in the affairs of less powerful nations, sometimes resorting to the use of force (for example in [[China]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and [[Venezuela]] in the early twentieth century). As a result, the doctrine of diplomatic protection has attracted much criticism, particularly in former colonies. Specifically, in [[Latin America]], the [[Calvo Doctrine]] was devised to avoid the invocation of diplomatic protection by Western nationals. Nevertheless, diplomatic protection has been recognized as customary international law by international courts and tribunals as well as scholars. After the [[Second World War]], with the use of force being outlawed as an instrument of international relations, diplomatic protection usually takes other forms, such as judicial proceedings or economic pressure.

==The nature of diplomatic protection==

Traditionally, diplomatic protection has been seen as a right of the state, not of the individual that has been wronged under international law. An injury to an alien is considered to be an indirect injury to his home country and in taking up his case the state is seen as asserting its own rights. This means that a state is in no way obliged to take up its national's case and resort to diplomatic protection if it considers this not to be in its own political or economic interests.

==Legal requirements==

Customary international law recognises the existence of certain requirements that must be met before a state can validly espouse its national's interest. The two main requirements are exhaustion of local remedies and continuous nationality.

===Exhaustion of local remedies===

Diplomatic espousal of a national's claims will not be internationally acceptable unless the national in question has given the host state the chance to correct the wrong done to him through its own national remedies. Exhaustion of local remedies usually means that the individual must first pursue his claims against the host state through its national courts up to the highest level before he can ask the state of his nationality to take up those claims and that state can validly do so.

===Effective and continuous nationality===

The second important requirement is that the individual who has been wronged must maintain the  nationality of the espousing state from the moment of injury until at least the presentation of the claim by way of diplomatic espousal. If the nationality of the individual in question changes in the meantime, the state of his former nationality will not be able validly to espouse his claims. The claim by a state on behalf of its national may also be dismissed or declared inadmissible if there is no effective and genuine link between the national concerned and the state that seeks to protect him (see the [[International Court of Justice]] judgment in the ''[[Nottebohm (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala)|Nottebohm]]'' case).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4927">Although elements of '''fashion design copyright''' may be traced in Europe to as early as the 15th century, &lt;ref name= salmon/&gt; as of [[as of|2016]] most countries (including the United States and the United Kingdom) [[fashion design]] does not have the same protection as other creative works (art, film, literature, etc.), because [[apparel]] (clothes, shoes, handbags, etc.) are classified as "functional items", excluded from protection by [[copyright law]]s. This explains the success of the [[knockoff]] businesses to the detriment of both the established labels, as well as of emerging designers, the latter ones being especially damaged, because they rely on relatively few designs.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314&gt;[https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/voices/discussions/what-is-the-real-cost-of-copycats/fashions-copycat-economy "What are the consequences of copycats?"], by Helena Pike, March 14, 2016, ''Business of Fashion''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
French king [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] &lt;ref name= salmon&gt;Salmon, J.H.M. "Francis I (France)." Encyclopedia. Issues &amp; Controversies. Facts On File News Services, n.d. Web. 4 Mar. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; gave out specific privileges related to the production of textiles. By 1711, in Lyon, illegalities were already being defined in regards to fashion materials, and in 1787, in England and Scotland fashion designers had fruitfully pushed their needs for protection into basic legislation. In 1876 Germany began protecting fashion patterns as well as models, and in 2002 European regulation on designs that were new and provided an aspect of fresh character or aesthetic were brought under protection.&lt;ref&gt;(Fischer Par. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; From 2004 to 2006 the ‚Äútotal production volume for clothing decreased by about 5% each year‚Ä¶ [and by] 2006 the European union trade deficit for clothing was at 33.7 billion.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;(Fischer Par. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics show that while there are benefits of their advanced design legislation, the economic and external factors still hindered their industry growth in ways the U.S. can empathize with. As 2007 came to a close, WIPO, or the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], had registered twenty-nine international designs.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Fridolin. ‚ÄúDesign Law in the European Fashion Sector‚Äù WIPO February 2008. Web. 10 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current regulation==
There are some elements of protection of fashion design, with limited effectiveness.  The copyright law covers creative elements of fashion designs, such as print patterns. [[Trademark law]] protects items with visibly displayed protected [[logo]]s. [[Intellectual property]] laws protect "[[trade dress]]", which is an appearance of a product which uniquely identifies its source to the level of a trademark.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314/&gt;

Some countries introduced other laws to protect fashion design, however the protection is inconsistent around the world.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314/&gt;

===European Union===
In the [[European Union]], the Creative Designs Directive and the European Designs Directive are in effect to protect new designs for three or five years.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314/&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Fashion design copyright in the United States}}
As of late 2015, fashion designs were not subject to copyright laws in the United States, and could not be copyrighted.&lt;ref&gt;"Protection for Fashion Design", Statement of the United States Copyright Office  before the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, United States House of Representatives, 109th Congress, 2nd Session, July 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion Design and Copyright in the US and EU", Michele Woods and Miyuki Monroig, Copyright Law Division, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Geneva, November 17, 2015. Web 25 Sep 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Several bills named [[Design Piracy Prohibition Act]] and some other similar ones attempted to introduce protection of [[apparel]].

== Societal impact ==
Resercher Johanna Blakley argues that the very lack of regulation of fashion design has allowed the fashion industry to do very well economically and has lead to the birth of [[fast fashion]] and a much faster changing of [[fashion trend]]s and has enabled pieces of clothing to become pieces of art. She also refers to [[Tom Ford]] pointing out that the people who buy cheap lookalikes are a different [[demography|demographic]] compared with people who buy the original very high end products and that while many exclusive designers get copied, also the high end designers often attribute the inspiration of their creations to following street fashion so the copying is a [[win-win game|two way street]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ted.com/talks/johanna_blakley_lessons_from_fashion_s_free_culture Johanna Blakley: Lessons from fashion&amp;#39;s free culture] TED Talk, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Interpleader Act of 1917'''  {{usstat|39|929}} was [[United States]] federal legislation enacted by the [[64th United States Congress]] approved February 22, 1917. In 1925 it was [[Codification (law)|codified]] in the [[United States Code]] as 28 U.S.C. 41(26) (1925).

==History ==
The Act allowed an [[insurance company]], or [[Friendly society|fraternal benefit society]] subject to multiple claims on the same [[Insurance policy|policy]] to file a suit in [[equity (law)|equity]] by a bill of [[interpleader]] in [[United States District Courts]] and providing nationwide [[service of process]]. It was introduced to overcome the ruling of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in [[New York Life v. Dunlevy]] {{ussc|241|518}}, that for a party to be bound by an interpleader that party must be served process in a way that obtains [[personal jurisdiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cleary | first1 = James T.| title = Federal Interpleader and Some Recent Cases| journal = Georgetown Law Journal| volume = 26 | pages = 1017| url =http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/glj26&amp;div=70&amp;id=&amp;page=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy must have a value of at least $500 is claimed or may be claimed by adverse claimants; which is less than the [[amount in controversy]] of $3,000 in Judicial Code ¬ß48(1) then required for general [[diversity jurisdiction]]. Two or more of the beneficiaries must live in different states.

This Act was amended in 1925 by {{usstat|43|976}} approved February  25, 1925 dividing it into three sections,  eliminating the words "may claim" that were in the 1917 act and clarifying the [[venue (law)|venue]] provisions . This element of [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil procedure]] was subsequently in 1926 was repealed and replaced by, {{usstat|44|416}} approved May 8,1926, which added  to those who can bring suit [[Casualty insurance|casualty]] company and [[surety]] company, empowered the court to enjoin claimant from proceeding in any state or other federal court on the same liability, adding provisions as to the proper venue for the interpleader in  cases were the claimants are in different districts. In 1936 the Federal Interpeader Act was again repealed and replaced by the [[Federal Interpleader Act of 1936]] , {{USStat|49|1096}}, approved Jan. 20, 1936, drafted by [[Zechariah Chafee]] which codified it in as [[Judicial Code of 1911|United States Judicial Code]] ¬ß41(26), and established the modern [[Interpleader#Statutory Interpleader|statutory interpleader]] allowing suite to be brought by any person, firm, corporation, association or society having custody of money or property or insurance policy or instrument valued at $500 or more which there are two or more adverse claimant who are citizens of different states, whether or not the claims have common origins, identical, adverse or independent of each other, and allowed it to be an [[:Category:equitable defenses|equitable defense]] in actions at [[Common law#3. Law as opposed to equity|law]], Judicial Code ¬ß274b. When  the United States Judicial Code was enacted into [[United States Code]] as [[positive law]] in 1948, {{usstat|62|931}} approved June 25, 1948, it was reconstituted as {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1335}}, {{usc|28|1397|pipe=1397}}, and {{usc|28|2361|pipe=2361}}.

==The Act==

United States District Courts have jurisdiction to hear suites in equity began by a bill of interpleader where:
*brought by insurance company, or fraternal beneficiary society
*duly verified
*the bill shows one or more person residing within the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] of the court is a [[bona fide]] claimant against the company or society
*the company or society made or issued an [[insurance policy]] or certificate of membership for the payment of at least $500
*to [[beneficiaries]], [[heir]]s, [[next of kin]], or legal representative of the insured person or member
*two or more adverse claimants, citizens of different states, are claiming or may claim entitlement to the insurance or benefits
*the company or society deposits the amount of such insurance or benefits with the [[clerk of the court]].

The court may issue process to any claimant to the [[United States Marshal Service|United States marshal]] of any district the claimant may reside or be found.

A civil '''gang injunction''' or '''CGI''' is a type of [[injunction|restraining order]] issued by [[court]]s in the [[United States]] prohibiting [[gang]] members in particular cities from participating in certain specified activities. It is based on the legal theory that gang activity constitutes a [[public nuisance]] that prevents non‚Äìgang members from enjoying peace in their communities.An injunction is obtained against the gang itself, and then the police and district attorney decide against whom they will enforce it on. Law enforcement use CGI's as a tool to label people as gang members and restrict their activities in a defined area (ACLU).

==History==

While Los Angeles experimented with gang injunctions in the 1980s, the first gang injunction to make headlines was obtained by [[Los Angeles City Attorney]] [[James Hahn]] against the [[West Los Angeles]]‚Äìbased [[Playboys Gansta Crip]] in 1987. The move was hailed as an innovative way for law enforcement to crack down on gangs, allowing people to regain control of their neighborhoods.The first gang injunction was in a Black low income community of Los Angeles.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}  According to Muniz{{who|date=October 2018}}, it was not the area with the most crime nor was it home to dangerous criminals, it simply threatened White middle and upper- class areas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} In 1993, the Los Angeles City Attorney's office filed for another injunction, this time against 500 members of the [[Blythe Street Gang]] of [[Panorama City, California|Panorama City]]. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] joined other groups in opposing the injunction, arguing that it would outlaw such legal activities as carrying on conversations and possessing tools like pocket knives and screwdrivers, and that it would lead to injustices against people whose identity had been mistaken. The injunction was issued despite the efforts against it. It was followed by injunctions in the cities of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[Westminster, California|Westminster]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], and [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]].

In the City of Los Angeles today,{{When|date = January 2014}} under current City Attorney Mike Feuer, there are 37 gang injunctions covering 57 gangs and 11,000 gang members. Many{{Who|date=April 2015}} attribute the 33% decline in gang membership in LA over the period 2001‚Äì6 (from 57,000 members in 2001 to roughly 39,000 members in 2006) to the effective use of civil gang injunctions by city law enforcement officials.{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}}

In 2010, the State of California surpassed the 150 gang injunction mark.&lt;ref name="crcpress"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439867877|first=Matthew |last=O'Deane|title= Gang Injunctions and Abatement: Using Civil Remedies to Curb Gang Related Crimes|date= November 2011|publisher=CRC Press Taylor &amp; Francis Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical and legal progression of all California gang injunctions to date can be reviewed in the CRC publication ''Gang Injunctions and Abatement: Using Civil Remedies to Curb Gang Related Crimes''. The history of the gang injunction began{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}} on July 22, 1982, when the Los Angeles City Attorney and the Los Angeles Police Department obtained a temporary restraining order against three named gangs: the Dogtown, Primera Flats, and the 62nd East Coast Crips gangs. Seventy-two members of the three gangs were targeted by police. This was the first gang injunction to sue a street gang as an unincorporated association. The injunction also named individual gang members as defendants. The injunction only had four restrictions, aimed at reducing graffiti, including prohibiting graffiti on private and public property, trespassing on private property with the intent to place graffiti, and an order for the gang to clean up the graffiti that displayed the name of their gang. The injunction also requested that the seventy-two named defendants be required to do five hours of community service to clean up graffiti.

On October 26, 1987, the Los Angeles City Attorney and the Los Angeles Police filed an injunction against the Playboy Gangster Crips gang. The injunction was a first of its kind in that it contained an array of provisions, never before attempted, aimed at restricting the gang's ability to operate and commit gang-related crimes. The preliminary injunction named twenty-three defendants. The injunction was ultimately limited in scope, as the judge only allowed restrictions that were listed in the penal code as restrictions and struck down the primary law enforcement goal, the no-association provision, which the court deemed inappropriate. The injunction was also the first to name [[John Doe|Does]], or any other members of the gang not yet identified, to be added at a later date if deemed appropriate by the police.

On October 7, 1992, the Burbank City Attorney and Burbank Police Department sought an injunction against the Barrio Elmwood Rifa gang. The target area consisted of an entire city block that the gang called home. The injunction did not name the gang as a defendant, but it did name thirty-four members of the gang. This was the first injunction to include a no-association clause prohibiting gathering or appearing anywhere in public view with any other defendant anywhere in the target area. The no-association restriction usually contains wording that prohibits the gang members from "standing, sitting, walking, driving, bicycling, gathering or appearing anywhere in public view with any other defendant herein, or with any other known gang member".&lt;ref name="crcpress" /&gt;

===Effectiveness===

In March 2011, a study entitled "Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Gang Injunctions in California" was published in the ''Journal of Criminal Justice Research''. It sought to determine whether gang injunctions reduce crime as compared to baseline and matched control areas. Twenty-five gang injunctions from four California counties were evaluated by extracting crime data from court records and police agencies. The control areas‚Äîcommunities with a similar gang problem but no gang injunctions‚Äîwere matched for similar gang ethnicity, gang size, proximity, and gang activity. Criminological deterrence, association, environmental, and economic theories served as theoretical foundations for the study. Calls for service were evaluated for a period one year before the injunction and one year after the injunction using paired t-tests, which revealed that gang injunctions reduce crime. Calls for service were significantly reduced compared to the baseline and the matched controls. Violent crime calls were found to decrease by 11.6% compared to the baseline, while controls averaged an increase of 0.8%, a net benefit of 12.4%. Less serious calls decreased 15.9% compared to the baseline, while controls averaged a mild increase of 1.6%, a net benefit of 17.5%. Total calls for service decreased 14.1% compared to the baseline, while controls averaged an increase of 2.3%, a net benefit of 16.4%. This study confirmed that gang injunctions can be a beneficial tool if used and implemented correctly and can reduce gang crime in the communities where they are implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.icjrc.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/RM210721_Final_Version_by_JCJR_for_Publication_1.63200430.pdf|format=PDF|first=Matthew|last=O'Deane|title= Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Gang Injunctions in California|year= March 2011|publisher= The Journal of Criminal Justice Research (JCJR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grogger (2002) found that gang injunctions reduce violent crime by 5%‚Äì10%. The Los Angeles Grand Jury (2004) found that gang injunctions reduce violent crime by 10% in the target areas. Maxson (2005) found that people living in the Verdugo Flats neighborhood in San Bernardino had less fear of crime following the implementation of the gang injunction evaluated.

However, many studies show that gang injunctions only deter violence for a limited amount of time. Four neighborhoods under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles Police Department saw a 5%‚Äì10% decrease of violent crime after the first year of implication,&lt;ref name="Grogger"&gt;Author: Jeffrey Grogger, Title: "The Effects of Civil Gang Injunctions on Reported Violent Crime: Evidence from Los Angeles County." 2002, Publisher: Journal of Law and Economics 45.1, Page(s): 69-90, Database: JSTOR, Accessed: Web. 19 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; while Oxnard, California, saw a decrease in homicides over the next three years.&lt;ref name="Barajas" /&gt; However, a separate study of five San Bernardino neighborhoods showed that the imposition of gang injunctions spurred conflicting results. While most neighborhoods experienced immediate benefits of fewer homicides, violent crime, or gang presence following an injunction, the benefits did not persist.&lt;ref name="Grogger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barajas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxson"&gt;Authors: Cheryl L. Maxson,  Karen M. Hennigan, and David C. Sloane. Title: "It's Getting Crazy Out There": Can A Civil Gang Injunction Change A Community?." 2005, Publisher: Criminology &amp; Public Policy 4.3 Page(s): 577-605, Database: Academic Search Complete, Accessed: Web. 19 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, one of the San Bernardino neighborhoods saw an increase of gang activity immediately post-injunction.&lt;ref name="Maxson" /&gt;

A 1991‚Äì96 study by the American Civil Liberties Union on the Blythe Street Gang revealed that violent crime tripled in the months immediately following the issuance. Additionally, Myers has concluded that gang repression leads to increased gang cohesion and police-community tension, as well as dispersion.

Further, while gang injunctions might lead to diminished crime in their specified locations, they can also divert crime into the surrounding areas, as was the case with the Blythe Street Gang. In the months following the institution of the gang injunction, violent crime almost doubled in the surrounding districts.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;Author: Thomas A Myers, Title: "The Unconstitutionality, Ineffectiveness, and Alternatives of Gang Injunctions." 2008-2009, Publisher: Michigan Journal of Race and Law 14.2 Page(s): 285-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also note that the 1990s also saw a sharp downturn of violent crime throughout the nation, which many studies reporting decreased crime fail to acknowledge. Thus, simple calculations of before and after statistics may exaggerate the effects of gang injunctions.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt;

Other studies take a more systemic approach to problematizing the gang. As Barajas writes, the gang emerges as a response to social, economic, and political repression experienced by low-income people of color. As the state functions as a site of violence and disidentification for particular populations, the gang constitutes a community through which youth can collectively furnish identity and social needs.&lt;ref name="Barajas" /&gt; For these reasons injunctions are severely limited in their capability to bring about lasting social change, since they fail to challenge the social arrangement from which gangs emerge as logical ends.

== Long-term impact ==
To follow up on the Maxson (2005) study and numerous media accounts of problems associated with not knowing the long-term impact of gang injunctions, O'Deane (2007) evaluated the six gangs in San Diego County that have had two gang injunctions implemented against them. The method used to update San Diego County gang injunctions requires the filing of a new injunction as the gang evolves over time to keep it up to date and relevant. Over time, gang members die, go to prison, move out of the area, or stop being active gang members. As older members distance themselves from the gang, younger members are typically created, creating the need for continued analysis and updating of the gang injunctions. The O'Deane study evaluated the status of the gang members named in the first injunction to determine what happened to them between the first and second injunctions against their gang. In each of the six cases reviewed, the police officers who obtained the first injunction and second injunctions provided updated data on each named member. They evaluated every member named in the first injunction as part of their investigation to determine if they were still active gang members who were still part of the public nuisance in the target area, potentially requiring their inclusion in the second injunction.&lt;ref name="crcpress"/&gt;

Similar to what happened in Los Angeles has happened in Southern California. According to San Diego County District Attorney in November 25, 1997 one of the  low income Latino neighborhoods, identified as Barrio Posole, in San Diego County was the first to have a civil gang injunction served to just under 30 men, since then they have had two other ones, with the most recent in 2011.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}The Posole gang, the Old Town National City gang, the Lincoln Park Bloods gang, the Westside gang, the Diablos gang, and the Varrio San Marcos gang are the six gangs in San Diego County that have been the subject of two injunctions each or have had their injunction modified or updated. The long-term evaluation of the six injunctions updated in San Diego revealed that many gang members included in injunctions do not stop their criminal activity after being served with the first injunction. This does not come as a surprise to many law enforcement officers, as the gang members selected to be included in injunctions are typically the most active and problematic. By reviewing the six San Diego injunctions, 185 gang members were named in the six original San Diego injunctions. Of those 185 gang members, 49 of them (27%) were added to the second injunction between five and seven years later because they were still active and still part of the nuisance in the target areas, according to police records. The 136 gang members (73%) who were not included in the second injunction were not included for several reasons: 4 were murder victims, 80 were in prison for committing new offenses, and 52 appeared to be non-active and had no recent contacts with law enforcement in their gang's territory. Most had no contacts anywhere in San Diego County. It appeared that 62% of the gang members served with the injunction did not make an effort to change their criminal ways, but 38% did to some degree and had very little or no activity that would support adding them on the second injunction against their gang. The second injunction increased the number of named gang members now impacted by the two injunctions: the combined defendants totaled 486 gang members on the six injunctions. A total of 301 new gang members were added to the second injunctions (535 gang members named in the 12 injunctions; however, 49 individuals were included in both the first and second injunctions against their gang, or 486 individuals in total ). It is apparent that the injunctions against the six gangs did not cause the gangs to cease to exist, and about two-thirds of the members named in the first injunction remained criminals, as evidenced by their arrests and convictions for new crimes after being enjoined.&lt;ref name="crcpress"/&gt;

The findings of this six-injunction review also suggest that the police did not reduce their enforcement efforts against the enjoined gang members, as many of the members named in the first injunctions were rearrested and imprisoned for new felony offenses. This finding supports the position that gang members are typically defiant and tend to continue their criminal activity until being stopped by arrest and incarceration. If the majority of the named gang members commit future crimes, it is difficult to explain how injunctions have a significant impact on crime reduction. Perhaps the threat of being served with an injunction dissuades uninvolved individuals from getting involved, thereby reducing crime. Perhaps the enjoined gang members become increasingly visible targets to police as a result of their inclusion in an injunction, which enhances their chance of rearrest due to the additional presence of police searching for violations of the injunctions. Perhaps those who do not reoffend leave the area, reducing crime in the target areas. Or perhaps those who do reoffend do so less often due to fear of being apprehended, reducing the volume of crimes committed in the target areas.&lt;ref name="crcpress" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Gang injunctions form the most important aspect of what is called the "suppression model" of anti-gang enforcement. The suppression model was criticized in a 1994 report by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention]], which stated that in communities where suppression is used, alternatives and diversion programs for at-risk youth diminish, and that the [[labor market]] is not sufficiently able to absorb undereducated adults who were involved in gangs during their youth. It also stated that while injunctions may be effective in decreasing gang activity in neighborhoods and small towns, they have little effect on gang activity in large cities such as Los Angeles. Gang injunctions have been further criticized as a zero-tolerance policy used to condemn, not rehabilitate, at-risk youth.&lt;ref name=Barajas&gt;Author: Frank P. Barajas, Title: An Invading Army: A Civil Gang Injunction in Southern California Chicana/o Community, 2007, Publisher: Latino Studies. Volume 5, Issue 4 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Under a CGI two friends or even family members cannot walk together to school. These CGI's  alienates these victims of the injunction and causes them to lose interest in school and other related activities and potentially dropout of school. Many labeled/ registered gang members are relatives and often married and could be punished for being outside their home together while helping their mother with groceries. Something so minute as to standing in public is the inequalities these men/boys deal with on an everyday basis.

== The Opposition ==
The opposition in favor of CGI's may say that CGI's lower crime but studies prove that although crime has decreased over the years this is incorrect and has contributed to mass incarceration. In their report Gang Wars... Kevin Pranis and Judith Greene examine the literature and conclude that the current preoccupation, caused  by moral panics with gangs is a distraction from very real problems of crime and violence that negatively impacts too many communities. Pranis also states that "Gangs do not drive crime rates, and aggressive suppression tactics simply make the situation worse by alienating local residents and trapping youth in the criminal justice system. Experts and researchers have concluded that CGI's are not useful and simply harm our youth.

===Cost===

Another criticism of gang injunctions relates to their cost. Gang injunctions constitute increased policing and therefore divert resources that could be used for youth social programs. As Barajas notes, gang injunctions in Oxnard were issued at a time when after-school programs were being underfunded and increasing numbers of children were funneling into gang culture as a result.&lt;ref name=Barajas /&gt; To date, gang injunctions in Oakland have cost the city over $1 million, while several elementary schools have shut down. Jeff Grogger addressed the issue of cost effectiveness in his research, highlighting how difficult it is to put an exact price tag on a gang injunction. Police and prosecutors do not track the number of hours put into the effort, the salaries and supplies needed to put the case together, and the cost associated with maintaining and prosecuting violations of the order. Gang injunctions are not unlike any other gang enforcement policy. The police do not seek community permission to conduct a wiretap investigation of the local gang that may cost much more than a gang injunction, nor do they request community approval to conduct large-scale gang sweeps that may involve police overtime costs. The police have a budget approved by their city council, as do sheriffs' departments with their county board of supervisors. The police who are trained on suppressing crime make decisions on how to spend their budget based on the community's needs. In communities where gangs are the primary problem, the department can make a decision to seek an injunction and allocate the funds they believe are appropriate to prepare and obtain the injunctions.

Attaching a cost to gang crime can be difficult, as it includes not only easily quantifiable costs, such as the dollar value of damaged property, but also many economic externalities in the form of non-quantifiable, subjective, or indirect costs‚Äîfor example, pain and trauma endured by victims of violence, depressed home and property values, and disincentives to business owners and entrepreneurs. The National Institute of Justice estimates that out of an overall cost of $655 billion, the financial cost of violent crime alone to American society is over $400 billion a year. Accounting for pain and suffering, as well as reduced quality of life, increases the total to $450 billion each year, or $1,800 per capita. Estimates of the average cost of single instances of a specific crime vary widely depending on the crime: a vehicle theft costs an average of $5,600; a burglary costs $2,300; a serious assault costs $19,000; and a gang murder costs $1 million, after accounting for the investigation, arrest, prosecution, and incarceration of the offender(s) and the pain and suffering, health care, lost income, and/or emotional trauma on the part of the victim(s).&lt;ref name="crcpress"/&gt;

Such estimates play an important part in policy makers' case to the media and to the general public for gang injunctions. The imputed costs of crimes averted as a result of a gang injunction can greatly outweigh the cost of the injunction's enforcement. For example, in the Posole gang injunction case in San Diego, ten murders occurred over the two-year period before the injunction was implemented, whereas no murders occurred during the four years following the implementation and enforcement of the injunction. No other suppression was noted by the Oceanside Police besides the injunction.{{Citation needed|reason=I couldn't find this piece of information in the cited source|date=October 2013}} Assuming that the decline in crime was caused by the gang injunction and that the decline would not have occurred in the injunction's absence, the $20,000 cost of implementing the injunction was significantly less than the expected cost of alternatives, according to estimates by the National Institute of Justice.&lt;ref name="crcpress"/&gt;

===Legal challenges===

In 1997, the case of ''People ex rel Gallo v Carlos Acuna''&lt;ref&gt;http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/s046980.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the [[constitutionality]] of gang injunctions. Lower courts had held that provisions disallowing gang members to associate with one another violated their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]] right to [[Freedom of assembly|free assembly]]. However, the [[Supreme Court of California]] upheld the constitutionality of the provision against association on the grounds that it was not constitutionally vague‚Äîit only applied to named gang members and only covered four square blocks&lt;ref&gt;Author: Beth Caldwell, Title: Criminalizing Day-To-Day Life: A Socio-Legal Critique Of Gang Injunctions, 2010, Publisher: American Journal of Criminal Law 37.3 241-290. Academic Search Complete. Web. 19 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîand found that gang activity fell under the definition of a public nuisance. Nonetheless, a dissenting opinion authored by Justice [[Stanley Mosk]] warned, "The majority would permit our cities to close off entire neighborhoods to [[Latino]] youths who have done nothing more than dress in blue or black clothing or associate with others who do so; they would authorize criminal penalties for ordinary, nondisruptive acts of walking or driving through a residential neighborhood with a relative or a friend."

In addition to limiting public association, many new injunctions include provisions against "otherwise legal behavior" like being outside after dark, possessing various objects, making gang-related hand signals, and wearing gang colors.&lt;ref name=Atkinson&gt;Author: Scott E. Atkinson, Title: "The Outer Limits Of Gang Injunctions." 2006 Publisher: Vanderbilt Law Review 59.5 Page(s): 1693-1733. Database: Academic Search Complete.  Accessed: Web. 19 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These later injunctions have been criticized by academics and legal practitioners for violating gang members' due process rights by not naming individual defendants,&lt;ref name=Atkinson /&gt; administering criminal penalties for essentially being guilty by association, and vague wording.&lt;ref&gt;Author: Mathew Mickle Werdegar, Title: "Enjoining the Constitution: The Use of Public Nuisance Abatement Injunctions against Urban Street Gangs" 1999, Publisher: Stanford Law Review. Volume 51, Issue 2&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested solutions to these problems include implementing procedural safeguards and gang-specific pleadings to protect defendants' due process rights and avoid the "void for vagueness".&lt;ref&gt;Author: Ryan Young, Title: "Sharpen The Blade: Void For Vagueness And Service Of Process Concerns In Civil Gang Injunctions." 2009, Publisher: Mcgeorge Law Review 40.4, Page(s): 1001-1038, Database: Academic Search Complete. Accessed: Web. 19 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms include the violation of gang members' civil liberties due to the broad geographic scope of some injunctions. In re Englebrecht upheld an injunction covering one square mile that included some gang members' residences. The 2005 injunction against the Colonia Chiques gang in Oxnard, California, covers 6.6 square miles, or 24% of the city. Scholars have argued that these broad areas heavily burden gang members' liberties and need be narrowly tailored to the conduct that directly facilitates public nuisance.&lt;ref name=Atkinson /&gt; Others have criticized the lack of an exit process to remove one's name from the list‚Äîa practice currently only used in San Francisco and Los Angeles‚Äîdue to the fact that non-gang-affiliated people often end up on injunction lists, as well as the questionable constitutionality of injunctions.&lt;ref&gt;Author: Lindsay Crawford, Title: "No Way Out: An Analysis Of Exit Processes For Gang Injunctions." 2009, Publisher: California Law Review 97.1, Page(s): 161-193, Database: Academic Search Complete. Accessed: Web. 19 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; While the United States Supreme Court has not directly addressed the constitutionality of injunctions,&lt;ref&gt;Author: Beth Caldwell, Title: "Criminalizing Day-To-Day Life: A Socio-Legal Critique Of Gang Injunctions." 2010, Publisher: American Journal of Criminal Law 37.3, Page(s): 241-290, Database: Academic Search Complete, Accessed: Web. 19 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 in ''[[Chicago v. Morales]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.streetgangs.com/injunctions/topics/061099morales.html{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; it upheld the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme Court]]'s ruling that a 1992 anti-"Congregation Ordinance" was unconstitutionally vague, violating [[due process]] and arbitrarily restricting [[Civil liberties|personal liberties]].

Prosecutors obtain gang injunctions by applying the law of public nuisance to the particular harms caused by criminal street gangs. Since gang injunctions started to be used as a tool more than 25 years ago, several cases have shaped how they are drafted and implemented. These cases all stem from common-law public nuisances that involve some interference with the interests of the community at large, interests that were recognized as rights of the general public entitled to protection. These restrictions have been attacked on numerous constitutional grounds, specifically on the doctrines of vagueness and over breadth, the First Amendment right to free association, the First Amendment right to freedom of expression, and procedural due process. O'Deane (2007) examined the legal issues surrounding gang injunctions and the case law applied to gang injunctions.&lt;ref name="crcpress"/&gt;

''Case Law: City of Chicago v.  Morales, 119 S.Ct. 1849. (Chicago Anti-Loitering Ordinance).'' In 1992, the Chicago City Council enacted the Gang Congregation Ordinance, which provided that whenever a police officer observed a person whom he/she reasonably believed to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public place with one or more other persons, he/she should order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area. Any person who did not promptly obey such an order was in violation of the ordinance. This ordinance was later determined to be unconstitutional, and some compare this case to the use of gang injunctions still today. The major difference is that the comparison is between a civil lawsuit and a city ordinance, which are two different things. The Illinois Supreme Court concluded that the ordinance violated due process of law because it was unconstitutionally vague and lent itself to arbitrary enforcement. Because the ordinance failed to give the ordinary citizen adequate notice of what was forbidden and permitted, it was impermissibly vague. The term "loiter" may have a common and accepted meaning, but the ordinance's definition of that term, "to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose", did not. This vagueness on the definition of loitering is what led to the rejection of the ordinance. The Illinois Supreme Court concluded that the ordinance did not provide sufficiently specific limits on the enforcement discretion of the police to meet constitutional standards for definiteness and clarity.&lt;ref name="crcpress" /&gt;

''Case Law: People v. Gonzalez, 910 P.2d 1366 (Cal. 1996).'' This case stems from the Blythe Street gang injunction. Defendant Jessie Gonzales, also known as "Speedy", fought his case to the California Supreme Court after he was arrested when he tossed a bottle of beer, ran from police, and forced his way inside a house to evade police without the homeowner's permission. Gonzalez claimed that because the injunction violation case against him was filed in a municipal court and the injunction was obtained in Superior Court, the defendant did not have an opportunity for proper relief (People v. Gonzalez, 910 P.2d 1366 Cal. 1996). Gonzalez was found guilty of violating the injunction. The conviction was used as a test case to challenge the validity of the controversial gang injunctions. Gonzalez denied being a gang member and argued that a municipal court judge did not have jurisdiction to review an order issued by a Superior Court judge. The Court of Appeal held that all criminal cases filed for violations of 166.4(a) PC must be filed directly in Superior Court. The state Supreme Court overruled the Appeal Courts decision and held that a municipal court judge does have "some limited right of review" over an order issued by a Superior Court judge. Since the ruling, virtually all gang injunction violation cases have been filed in Superior Court as criminal misdemeanor violations. This is the preferred method, compared to civil contempt violations, which have a maximum penalty of five days in custody. A criminal violation allows the prosecutor to seek probation and jail time for repeat offenders, increasing the severity of the violations.&lt;ref name="crcpress" /&gt;

''Case Law: People  v.  Acuna (Cal.  App. 1995) April 24, 1995.'' On April 24, 2005, the court of appeals for the sixth district upheld the issuance of the Sur Trece injunction but struck down every provision in the order that was not already a violation of statutory law (People v. Acuna, 1995). The decision invalidated 15 of the 24 provisions in the preliminary injunction sought by the Santa Clara District Attorney in February 1993. The California Court of Appeal also ruled that the "harassing, intimidating and annoying" language of the injunction was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad and that the prohibition of the gang members congregating in Rocksprings violated their First Amendment right to free association. The San Jose City Council authorized an appeal of that decision to the California Supreme Court, resulting in the opinion reported in People ex rel. Gallo vs. Acuna (1997) 14 Cal. 4th 1090. The appellate court upheld only those provisions that enjoined criminal conduct, as in the case of the Playboy Gangster Crips from 1987 in Los Angeles. The California Court of Appeals found that the injunction against the Varrio Sureno Treces gang was overly broad and did not sufficiently define the prohibited activities or provide definite standard for police enforcement and ascertainment of guilt. The City of San Jose appealed to the state Supreme Court to reinstate two of the fifteen provisions that were struck down, which included the no association clause and the no confronting, intimidating, harassing, and threatening clause. The appeal to the State Supreme Court was filed.&lt;ref name="crcpress" /&gt;

''Case Law: People ex rel. Gallo vs. Acuna (1997) 14 Cal. 4th 1090.'' On January 30, 1997, the constitutionality of gang injunctions as we know them today was established. The California Supreme Court ruled that the City of San Jose may implement a civil gang injunction that restricts non-criminal behavior if committed by alleged gang members in a particular neighborhood. The court overturned the April 1995 appellate court decision in the case. The ACLU and others in opposition to gang injunctions were forced to acknowledge that the decision by the state's highest court would add momentum and increase usage of the increasingly popular technique. The 4‚Äì3 ruling, overturning a Court of Appeal decision, upheld a San Jose injunction that barred the gang members from "standing, sitting, walking, driving, gathering or appearing anywhere in public view" with each other in a four-block radius. "Liberty unrestrained is an invitation to anarchy," Justice Janice Rogers Brown wrote for the court. "Freedom and responsibility are joined at the hip." The decision removes a legal cloud over such gang-abatement injunctions, which have been growing in popularity in California as a tool to combat gangs.&lt;ref name="crcpress" /&gt;

The case gave law enforcement the framework for what is needed to seek and obtain gang injunctions. But civil libertarians argue that these injunctions go too far, violating such basic constitutional rights as freedom of speech and freedom of association. Justice Ming W. Chin agreed that courts can prohibit behavior even if it is legal but objected that the injunction. The judge stated, "I do not discount the serious threat to community values that criminal street gangs pose, nevertheless, we cannot turn a blind eye to the necessities of proof. Individuals should not be named as gang members without corroborating evidence that they substantially contributed to the nuisance or intended to do so in the future". The ACLU argued the case before the high court, stating that San Jose's gang injunction was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad and targeted Latino youths without sufficient proof that they had committed any crimes or harassed residents. The ACLU's stance was that because the defendants are suspected gang members, they are stripped of a variety of constitutional freedoms, including the rights to association, assembly, and due process. The ACLU felt the ruling effectively placed law-making power in the hands of judges instead of the legislature, making it unconstitutional. The case submitted contained substantial evidence that the gang was responsible for significant crimes and the named defendants were responsible for some of them. The California Supreme Court held that the gang injunction was neither vague nor overly broad because its terms were reasonably clear in the context of the Varrio Sureno Treces gang. The court also held that the anti-gang injunction did not violate the free association rights of the Varrio Sur Treces members because there is no cognizable First Amendment right to free association implicated by membership in a criminal street gang. Although the Varrio Sur Treces members sought certiorari by the United States Supreme Court, the writ was denied. Thus, in California, anti-gang injunctions have become an established law enforcement tool.&lt;ref name="crcpress" /&gt;

=== Racial profiling ===
See also [[Racial profiling]]

According to some critics, the vagueness of gang injunctions and gang identification give way to a system of policing that uses racial profiling to classify and criminalize civilians, even if innocent.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;Author: Lawrence Rosenthal, Title: "Gang Loitering and Race." 2000-2001, Publisher: The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 91.1 Page(s): 99-160.&lt;/ref&gt; Police are accused of using stereotypes that are perpetuated through the media to target potential gang members. Therefore, urban youth of color (often African American or Latino) implicitly become the targets of gang injunctions.

=== Incarceration of youth ===
The functionality of gang injunctions, particularly when coupled with racial profiling, has been said to over-criminalize youth. Youth who have been filed under an injunction or are suspected to be gang members can have their charges intensified from infractions to misdemeanors or misdemeanors to felonies.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;Author: Gary Stewart, Title: "Black Codes and Broken Windows Theory: The Legacy of Racial Hegemony in Anti-Gang Civil Injunctions." 1997, Publisher: The Yale Law Journal 107.7 Page(s): 2249-280.&lt;/ref&gt; Mendel claims that juvenile incarceration does not improve public safety but rather harms it: it actually exacerbates criminality and increases recidivism among youth.&lt;ref name=Mendel&gt;Author: Richard A Mendel, Title: No Place for Kids: The Case for Reducing Juvenile Incarceration. 2011, Publisher: The Annie E. Casey Foundation: Baltimore.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting Mendel's claims, Kiriakidis further argues that only a small fraction of offenders are given custodial sentences, most of which are too short to actually prevent juveniles from continuing their criminal activities. As a solution, he proposes counseling intervention to reduce recidivism.&lt;ref name=Kiriakidis&gt;Author: Stavros Kiriakidis, Title: "Counseling Interventions for Adolescents and Young People in Penal Institutions." 2008, Publisher: International Journal of Special Education, Page(s): 159-162, Accessed: 20 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of prevention programs: primary prevention programs, which target the general youth population and attempt to prevent smoking, drug abuse, and teen pregnancy; and secondary prevention programs, which target youth who are at risk for such outcomes as delinquency or violence. David Old's Nurse Home Visitation Program, for example, significantly decreased child abuse and neglect and arrest rates for both children and mothers. According to Greenwood, programs that underscore family interactions are the most successful, "because they focus on providing skills to the adults who are in the best position to supervise and train the child".&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;Author: Peter Greenwood, Title: "Prevention and Intervention Programs for Juvenile Offenders." 2008, Publisher: Future of Children, Page(s): 185-210 Accessed: 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, youth offenders should not be incarcerated but rather be placed in programs in such settings so they will not engage in further criminal activities.&lt;ref name=Greenwood /&gt;

==Alternatives==
Although gang injunctions can provide immediate deterrence of gang violence, studies recommend they should be used in conjunction with gang-intervention and gang-rehabilitation programs, which have also reduced gang activity within communities. Statistics provided by the LAPD and the NYPD show that overall gang violence decreased in neighborhoods that implemented gang intervention programs without the use of excessive policing.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; Further, a study conducted on convicted criminals shows possible benefits of rehabilitation among both gang members and non‚Äìgang members: gang members who received treatment experienced a 20% difference in recidivism rate versus those who did not, and ‚Äìgang members who received treatment experienced a 6% difference in recidivism rate versus those who did not.&lt;ref name="Di Placido"&gt;Authors: Di Placido, Chantal, Terri L. Simon, Treena D. Witte, Deqiang Gu, and Stephen C. P. Wong, Title: "Treatment of Gang Members Can Reduce Recidivism and Institutional Misconduct." 2006, Publisher: Law and Human Behavior 30.1 Page(s): 93-114, Database: JSTOR, Accessed: 20 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gangs serve as proxies for the after-school programs that the middle class takes for granted.&lt;ref name="Stewart" /&gt; Studies have shown that there is less gang activity in cities where intervention programs are implemented, instead of gang injunctions.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; Statistics from the LAPD and the NYPD show that there was dramatic decrease in New York City's crime after city council implemented intervention programs. However, in Los Angeles, city council did the opposite and implemented more gang injunctions. In 2005, the NYPD reported only 520 crimes that were gang related, while the LAPD reported 11,402 gang-related crimes.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; New York City continues to see a decrease as it opens more recreational centers and offers job opportunities for youth.{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}}

==Gang injunctions today==

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}Since 1999, to prevent rulings against injunctions in the name of constitutionality, city attorneys have carefully worded their filings so that they individually name every gang member, establish a designated area in which the injunction applies, and enumerate the exact activities that gang members are prohibited from doing. These generally include association with one another, wearing certain clothes, making certain hand gestures, acting as lookouts, fighting, drinking, and using drugs. Some prohibited activities are already illegal, but the injunction means that violators can be held in [[contempt of court]], which would demand additional sanctions. Violators who conduct activities that are normally legal are charged with violating a court order, which can carry a six-month jail sentence in California.

'''''Getup Ltd v Electoral Commissioner (2010'')''' was a landmark decision made by the [[Federal Court of Australia]] on 13 August 2010 allowing Australians to enrol online in future elections. The Federal Court ruled in favour of Getup in their challenging of the [[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|cea1918233|Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that rejected first-time voter, Sophie Trevitt‚Äôs electronic enrolment application after her [[electronic signature]] was deemed invalid.&lt;ref name="2010 FCA 869"&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|869|2010|litigants=Getup Ltd v Electoral Commissioner |date=13 August 2010 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Case ==

In June 2010 it was estimated that more than 1.4 million Australians were not enrolled to vote.&lt;ref name="Famous"/&gt; in the lead up to the Australian Federal election on 21 August 2010, political activists group Getup developed a strategy to capture this market by providing an online enrolment facility, OzEnrol, which enabled users to enter the required details into an electronically submittable form, using a digital pen, mouse or laptop trackpad to sign their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/activists-to-pursue-online-enrolment-20100721-10ln0 |title=Activists to pursue online enrolment |last=Sharp |first=A |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=22 July 2010 |access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 2010, the Australian electoral Commission disallowed Sophie Trevitts's use of the OzEnrole tool to apply for enrolment in the electorate of Granydler, NSW

== Arguments ==

The Commissioner claimed he acted under Section 102(1)(c) of the ''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|cea1918233|Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918|102}}(1)(c).&lt;/ref&gt; granting him the discretion in judging whether Ms Trevitt‚Äôs enrolment application was ‚Äúin order‚Äù. The criteria for reaching such a decision are outlined in Section 98(2) in particular:

:''A claim:
:''(a) must be in the appropriate form; and
:''(b) must be signed by the claimant;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|cea1918233|Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918|98}}(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the Electoral Commission ruled Ms Trevitt‚Äôs application was not in order- citing a breach of Section 336 of the ''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918'':

:''Every electoral paper which by this Act or the regulations has to be signed by any person shall be signed by that person with his or her personal signature.&lt;br /&gt;''

The Electoral Commissioner claimed that the Act implied enrolments were to be signed by hand.

Getup argued the electronic signature provided by Trevitt was legitimate in accordance with Section 8(1) of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999:

:''For the purposes of a law of the Commonwealth, a transaction is not invalid because it took place wholly or partly by means of one or more electronic communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|eta1999256|Electronic Transactions Act 1999|8}}(2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''

The Act is applicable to transactions including those ‚Äúof a non-commercial nature‚Äù like that of the enrolment application.
The Commissioner also expressed concerns over the quality of electronic signatures, noting their tendency to become pixilated in comparison to those that were hand-written. In response, Getup highlighted the Commissioner‚Äôs frequent acceptance of enrolment forms via facsimile and scanned documents sent through email, recommending applicants do so using the lowest resolution at 100 dots per inch ([[Dots per inch|DPI]]), thus rendering the signature quality to that comparable to one electronically produced.

== Federal Court decision ==

[[Nye Perram|Justice Perram]] agreed with Getup regarding the acceptability of electronic signatures noting that it resembled one which had been faxed or emailed and thus would have been accepted by the Commissioner.&lt;ref name="2010 FCA 869"/&gt;{{rp|at [16]}}

The case subsequently became a technical debate over how the ''Commonwealth Electoral Act'' and ''Electronic Transactions Act'' were to be interpreted together considering the present context. Perram J disagreed with the Commissioner‚Äôs interpretation of Section 102(1) of the ''Commonwealth Electoral Act'' allowing him the discretion to form an opinion regarding the validity of Ms Trevitt‚Äôs application. He stated that such freedom was limited to determining whether the claimant was entitled to be enrolled- which she was having fulfilled the criteria of being over 18 years of age and an Australian citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Enrolling_to_vote/Eligibility.htm Enrolment eligiblility - Australian Electoral Commission&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Perram J ruled that Ms Trevitt‚Äôs enrolment claim was ‚Äúin order‚Äù due to the fact that the ''Electronic Transactions Act'' was applicable to the meaning of Section 102(1)(b) of the ''Commonwealth Electoral Act'' and therefore a digital signature fulfilled the necessary enrolment requirement. The respondent was ordered to pay the applicants‚Äô costs and Ms Trevitt‚Äôs online claim was added to the electoral role.

== Implications ==

The Federal Court made its ruling in a context where the Electoral Commissioner was already accepting signatures in forms (such as [[facsimile]], [[JPEG]] image) that were susceptible to a degree of manipulation. Perram J‚Äôs decision offers no reflection on the reliability or appropriateness of using electronic signatures; it merely discounts any form of [[discrimination]] in favour of non-electronic signature methods thus enforcing the concept of ‚Äòtechnology neutrality‚Äô as a key principle of the ''Electronic Transactions Act''. As such, the success of this test case sets a precedent for future matters relating to the legitimate use of digital signatures as a means of identity verification- an issue likely to become more prevalent as dependence on technology continues to escalate. The outcome of the case does not however consider issues such as security and [[fraud detection]] which need to be addressed before the use of electronic signatures can be safely used in e-commerce practices.

The result paves the way for a review of the electoral process and will encourage Federal and State governments to use the online medium in attempts to capture the estimated 6% of the Australian population who are not enrolled to vote. With an increased number of voters in each election, and the vast majority of them being young people (70% of those not on the electoral roll are aged between 19 and 39,&lt;ref name="Famous"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/media/media-releases/2010/6-8.htm |title=Media Release 2010: Famous Australians are doing it ... so why aren't you? |publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the Australian political circuit will become more competitive with policies likely to be more progressive in order to attract their votes.

This case relied heavily on [[litigation funding]] from Getup supporters and was a major success in the realm of [[public interest]] lawsuits. Further, the courts have historically played a minimal role in shaping the Australian electoral process. ''Getup Ltd v Electoral Commissioner (2010)'' was a breakthrough success as it proved the ability of the Australian community to fuel legal and political debate over issues of public interest. The court‚Äôs ruling also encourages the public to identify potential areas for change in Australian legislation and challenges the traditional assumptions of the law in a manner that reflects the 21st century and the advancements it offers.

[http://www.oea.gov.au/graphics.asp?showdoc=/employers/unionGreenfieldAgreement.asp] [http://www.workplaceinfo.com.au/nocookie/alert/2005/051027730.htm].

This has a number of benefits for the [[employer]]. A key advantage is that a greenfield agreement does not require the approval of any employees whose [[employment]] would be subject to the agreement. Basically, there are no employees to negotiate with. Another key benefit is that a greenfield agreement provides an employer with the opportunity to shut out less desirable [[Trade union|unions]] as parties and therefore effectively having a presence at the new business before the employment of any employees.

Greenfield agreements must involve a ''genuinely'' new [[Business|enterprise]]; a business cannot simply initiate a new project and use this as grounds to negotiate a greenfield agreement. [http://www.ablawyers.com.au/ThemakingofGreenfieldAgreementsfornewprojects.htm]

In [[competition law]], a '''group boycott''' is a type of [[secondary boycott]] in which two or more [[Competition (economics)|competitors]] in a [[relevant market]] refuse to conduct business with a firm unless the firm agrees to cease doing business with an actual or potential competitor of the firms conducting the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a form of [[refusal to deal]], and can be a method of shutting a competitor out of a market, or preventing entry of a new firm into a market.

In the United States, such conduct can be held to violate the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].  Depending upon the nature of the boycott, the courts may either apply the [[rule of reason]], or hold that the boycott is [[illegal per se|illegal ''per se'']].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It may also be considered a form of [[Conspiracy (civil)|civil conspiracy]].

[[File:Secret Journal of the Hartford Convention.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Secret Journal of the Hartford Convention, published 1823.]]
The '''Hartford Convention''' was a series of meetings from December 15, 1814 ‚Äì January 5, 1815, in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], United States, in which the [[New England]] [[Federalist Party]] met to discuss their grievances concerning the ongoing [[War of 1812]] and the political problems arising from the federal government's increasing power.

The convention discussed removing the [[three-fifths compromise]] which gave slave states more power in Congress and requiring a two-thirds vote in Congress for the admission of new states, declarations of war, and creating laws restricting trade. The Federalists also discussed their grievances with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the [[Embargo of 1807]]. However, weeks after the convention's end, news of Major General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s overwhelming [[Battle of New Orleans|victory in New Orleans]] swept over the Northeast, discrediting and disgracing the Federalists, resulting in their elimination as a major national political force.

==Background==
===American relations with Great Britain and France===
Under the administrations of [[George Washington]] and [[John Adams]], a vigorous trade with France was maintained while both administrations engaged in [[Quasi-War|an undeclared war with France]]. With the resumption of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the same time that [[Thomas Jefferson]] assumed office, relations with both France and Great Britain declined. Jefferson's goal was an expansion of free trade created by Great Britain lifting trade restrictions placed against the United States. However, to force Britain into compliance, he adopted anti-foreign trade policies such as the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] and the [[Non-Intercourse Act (1809)|Non-Intercourse Act]] of 1809. These policies were very unpopular among Northeastern merchants and shippers. Jefferson's successor, President [[James Madison]], and what is now called the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], continued his policies.&lt;ref&gt;Banner (1988) pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposing Federalist Party regained strength especially in New England, and in [[New York (state)|New York]] where it collaborated with Lieutenant Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] of New York City and supported him for president in 1812.

===Opposition to the War of 1812===
When Madison was re-elected in 1812 the discontent in New England intensified. In late 1813 Madison signed a more restrictive embargo act than any of those approved by Jefferson, this time prohibiting all trade between American ports (the coastal trade) and fishing outside harbors.&lt;ref&gt;Morison (1968) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1814, the war had turned against the Americans. After ending their war with Napoleonic France, Great Britain was able to marshal more resources to North America and had effectively blockaded the entire eastern coastline. Territory in the [[District of Maine|Maine district]] of [[Massachusetts]] was occupied in July, in August the [[White House]] and [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] were [[Burning of Washington|burned]], and by September the British were advancing further in Maine and the [[Lake Champlain]] area of New York. A naval assault on [[Boston]] was expected in the near future. Free trade with the rest of the world had virtually ceased, thousands were thrown out of work, and by August banks were suspending [[coin|specie]] payment. The federal government was approaching bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Banner (1988) p. 24. Morison (1968) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

New England governors followed a policy of giving minimal support to the Federal government in waging the war. With the exception of Governor [[John Taylor Gilman]] of [[New Hampshire]], most requisitions for state militia were denied. New Englanders were reluctant to have their militia, needed to defend their coasts from British attacks, assigned elsewhere or placed under the command of the regular army. General [[Winfield Scott]], after the war, blamed Madison's policy of ignoring Federalists, who in New England constituted the best educated class, when granting regular army commissions in New England.&lt;ref&gt;Morison (1968) p. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-war sentiment in Massachusetts was so strong that even [[Samuel Dexter]], the Democratic-Republican candidate for governor, opposed the national party's commerce policies. Federalists still dominated the 1814&amp;nbsp;elections, returning [[Caleb Strong]] as governor and electing 360&amp;nbsp;Federalists against only 156&amp;nbsp;Democratic-Republicans to the lower house of the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts Legislature]]. In September Governor Strong refused a request to provide and support 5,000&amp;nbsp;troops to retake territory in Maine.&lt;ref&gt;Morison (1968) p. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Massachusetts and [[Connecticut]] had refused to subject their militia to the orders of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], Madison declined to pay their expenses. Consequently, critics said that Madison had abandoned New England to the common enemy. The Massachusetts Legislature appropriated $1 million to support a state army of 10,000&amp;nbsp;men. [[Harrison Gray Otis (lawyer)|Harrison Gray Otis]], who inspired these measures, suggested that the Eastern States meet at a convention in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. As early as 1804 some New England Federalists had discussed secession from the Union if the national government became too oppressive.&lt;ref&gt;Schouler, ''History of the United States'' vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In September&amp;nbsp;1814 Madison asked Congress for a conscription bill. Even though this had not been one of the original grievances that led to the call for the convention, Federalists presented this as further proof that the Democratic-Republicans intended to bring military despotism into the nation. [[Thomas P. Grosvenor|Thomas Grosvenor]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] saw this as the result of the administration leading the country "defenseless and naked, into that lake of blood she is yet swimming".&lt;ref&gt;Buel (2005) pp. 224-225&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secession===
Secession was again mentioned in 1814‚Äì1815; all but one leading Federalist newspaper in New England supported a plan to expel the western states from the Union. Otis, the key leader of the Convention, blocked radical proposals such as a seizure of the Federal customs house, impounding federal funds, or declaring neutrality. Otis thought the Madison administration was near collapse and that unless conservatives like himself and the other delegates took charge, the radical secessionists might take power. Indeed, Otis was unaware that Massachusetts Governor Strong had already sent a secret mission to discuss terms with the British for a separate peace.&lt;ref&gt;Morison (1969) 362-370.  Morison (1968) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of reasons why historians doubt that the New England Federalists were seriously considering secession. All the states, especially Connecticut with its [[Connecticut Western Reserve|claims to western lands]], stood to lose more than they would gain.  Efforts were made in the delegation selection process to exclude firebrands like [[John Lowell, Jr. (lawyer)|John Lowell,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], [[Timothy Pickering]], and [[Josiah Quincy III|Josiah Quincy]] who might have pushed for secession, and the final report of the convention did not propose secession.&lt;ref&gt;Buel (2005) pp.219-220. Morison (1968) p. 53. Morison referred to "a myth of a New England secessionist plot" and said. "This myth, although shown to be false by every serious historian of the United States for the past 150&amp;nbsp;years, is so pleasing to people who dislike New England that many to this day continue to believe it."&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the Madison administration had reasons to be concerned about the consequences of the Hartford Convention. Federalists were already blocking administration efforts to finance the war and bring it to a successful conclusion with an invasion of Canada. There were fears that New England would negotiate a separate peace with Great Britain, an action in many ways just as harmful to the nation as actual secession. In preparing for a worst-case scenario, Madison moved troops from the New York‚ÄìCanada border to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] where they could quickly be sent to Massachusetts or Connecticut if needed to preserve federal authority. Several New England regiments that had participated in the [[Niagara campaign]] were returned home where it was hoped that they could serve as a focal point for New Englanders opposed to disunion.&lt;ref&gt;Buel (2005) pp.219-221&lt;/ref&gt;

==Call for the Convention==
In response to the war crisis, Governor Strong called the newly elected [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] to a special session on October&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;1814. Strong's message to the legislature was referred to a joint committee headed by Harrison Gray Otis.  Otis was considered a moderate. His report delivered three days later called for resistance of any British invasion, criticized the leadership that had brought the nation close to disaster, and called for a convention of New England states to deal with both their common grievances and common defense. Otis' report was passed by the [[Massachusetts Senate|state senate]] on October 12 by a 22 to 12 vote and the house on October 16 by 260 to 20.&lt;ref&gt;Morison (1968) pp. 44-46&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter of invitation was sent to the other New England governors to send delegates to a convention in Hartford, Connecticut. The stated purpose of the convention was to propose constitutional amendments to protect their section's interests and to make arrangements with the Federal government for their own military defense.&lt;ref&gt;Morison (1968) pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve delegates were appointed by the Massachusetts legislature, of which George Cabot and Harrison G. Otis were chief (see list below). In Connecticut, the [[Connecticut General Assembly|legislature]] denounced Madison's "odious and disastrous war", voiced concern about plans to implement a national draft, and selected seven delegates led by [[Chauncey Goodrich]] and [[James Hillhouse]]. [[Rhode Island General Assembly|Rhode Island's legislature]] selected four delegates to discuss "the best means of cooperating for our mutual defense against the common enemy, and upon the measures which it may be in the power of said states, consistently with their obligations to adopt, to restore and secure to the people thereof, their rights and privileges under the Constitution of the United States". [[New Hampshire General Court|New Hampshire's legislature]] was not in session and its Federalist governor, John Gilman, refused to call it back into session. [[Vermont General Assembly|Vermont's legislature]] voted unanimously not to send delegates. Two New Hampshire counties and one Vermont county each sent a delegate, bringing the total to 26.&lt;ref&gt;Buel (2005) pp. 217-218&lt;/ref&gt; On December&amp;nbsp;15,&amp;nbsp;1814 the delegates met in the [[Connecticut Senate]]'s chamber at the [[Old State House (Hartford)|Old State House]] in Hartford.

The following lists the states that attended and the names of the twenty-six attendees.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1918) p. 95. Lyman (1823) pp. 23, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secret meetings==
In all, twenty-six delegates attended the secret meetings. No records of the proceedings were kept, and meetings continued through January&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;1815. After choosing [[George Cabot]] as president, and [[Theodore Dwight (elder)|Theodore Dwight]] as secretary, the present convention remained in closed session for three continuous weeks.  Cabot's journal of its proceedings, when it was eventually opened, was a meager sketch of formal proceedings; he made no record of yeas and nays, stated none of the amendments offered to the various reports, and neglected to attach the name of authors to propositions. It is impossible to ascertain the speeches or votes of individual delegates.

==Convention report==
{{wikisource|Report and Resolutions of the Hartford Convention}}
The convention ended with a report and resolutions, signed by the delegates present, and adopted on the day before final adjournment.  The report said that New England had a "duty" to assert its authority over [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] infringements on its sovereignty‚Äîa doctrine that echoed the policy of Jefferson and Madison in 1798 (in the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]]), and which would later reappear in a different context as "[[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]]".

The Hartford Convention's final report proposed several amendments to the [[United States Constitution|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Constitution]]. These attempted to combat the policies of the ruling Democratic-Republicans by: 
#Prohibiting any trade [[embargo]] lasting over 60 days; 
#Requiring a [[two-thirds majority|two-thirds Congressional majority]] for declaration of offensive war, admission of a new state, or interdiction of foreign commerce; 
#Removing the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]] representation advantage of the South; 
#Limiting future Presidents to one term; 
#Requiring each President to be from a different state than his predecessor. (This provision was aimed directly at the [[Virginia Dynasty|dominance of Virginia]] in the presidency since 1800.)

==Negative reception and legacy==
[[File:TheHartfordConventionOrLeapNoLeap.jpg|thumb|350px|right|''The Hartford Convention or LEAP NO LEAP'', by [[William Charles (cartoonist)|William Charles]].]]

The [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] Congress would never have recommended any of New England's proposals for ratification. Hartford delegates intended for them to embarrass the President and the Democratic-Republicans in Congress‚Äîand also to serve as a basis for negotiations between New England and the rest of the country.

Some delegates may have been in favor of New England's secession from the United States, and forming an independent republic, though no such resolution was adopted at the convention. Historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] rejected the notion that Hartford was an attempt to take New England out of the Union and give treasonous aid and comfort to Britain. Morison wrote, "Democratic politicians, seeking a foil to their own mismanagement of the war and to discredit the still formidable Federalist party, caressed and fed this infant myth until it became so tough and lusty as to defy both solemn denials and documentary proof."&lt;ref&gt;Morison (1969) p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;

After the convention Massachusetts sent three commissioners to Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C. to negotiate for the terms that had been agreed. By the time they arrived in February&amp;nbsp;1815, news of [[Andrew Jackson]]'s overwhelming victory at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], and the signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]], preceded them and, consequently, their presence in the capital seemed both ludicrous and subversive. They quickly returned. Thereafter, both ''Hartford Convention'' and ''Federalist Party'' became synonymous with disunion, secession, and treason, especially in the South. The party was ruined, and ceased to be a significant force in national politics, although in a few places (notably Massachusetts, where Federalists were elected governor annually until 1823) it retained some power.

The '''International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling''' is an [[environmental agreement|international environmental agreement]] signed in 1946 in order to "provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling|url=http://www.iwcoffice.org/private/downloads/1r2jdhu5xtuswws0ocw04wgcw/convention.pdf|website=iwcoffice.org|accessdate=5 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407095822/http://www.iwcoffice.org/private/downloads/1r2jdhu5xtuswws0ocw04wgcw/convention.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |location=Washington|format=PDF|date=2 December 1946|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It governs the commercial, scientific, and aboriginal subsistence whaling practices of fifty-nine member nations.

It was signed by 15 nations in Washington, D.C. on 2 December 1946&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwcoffice.org/commission/convention.htm#convsigs Key Documents]. Iwcoffice.org. Retrieved on 23 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and took effect on 10 November 1948. Its protocol (which represented the first substantial revision of the convention and extended the definition of a "[[whale catcher|whale-catcher]]" to include helicopters as well as ships) was signed in Washington on 19 November 1956. The convention is a successor to the '''International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling''', signed in London on 8 June 1937, and the protocols for that agreement signed in London on 24 June 1938, and 26 November 1945.

The objectives of the agreement are the protection of all whale species from [[overhunting]], the establishment of a system of international regulation for the whale fisheries to ensure proper conservation and development of whale stocks, and safeguarding for future generations the great natural resources represented by whale stocks. The primary instrument for the realization of these aims is the [[International Whaling Commission]] which was established pursuant to this convention. The commission has made many revisions to the schedule that makes up the bulk of the convention. The Commission process has also reserved for governments the right to carry out scientific research which involves killing of whales.

There have been consistent disagreement over the scope of the convention. According to the IWC:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The 1946 Convention does not define a 'whale', although a list of names in a number of languages was annexed to the Final Act of the Convention. Some Governments take the view that the IWC has the legal competence to regulate catches of only these named great whales (the baleen whales and the sperm whale). Others believe that all cetaceans, including the smaller dolphins and porpoises, also fall within IWC jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwcoffice.org/cetacea|title=Cetacea|author=International Whaling Commission|date=|work=iwcoffice.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727052230/http://iwcoffice.org/cetacea |archivedate=27 July 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwc.int/cetacea|title=Cetacea|author=|date=|work=iwc.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Signatories and membership==
As of January 2014, membership consists of 89 states of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwc.int/members|title=Membership|author=International Whaling Commission|date=|work=iwc.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial signatory states were [[Argentina]], Australia, [[Brazil]], Canada, [[Chile]], [[Denmark]], France, the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Peru]], South Africa, the [[Soviet Union]], the United Kingdom and the United States.

Although Norway is a party to the convention, it maintains an objection to paragraph 10(e) of the convention (the section referring to the 1986 moratorium). Therefore, that provision is not binding upon Norway and the 1986 IWC global moratorium does not apply to it.&lt;ref name="iwcoffice.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwcoffice.org/commission/schedule.htm |accessdate=January 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113034345/http://iwcoffice.org/commission/schedule.htm |archivedate=January 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withdrawals==
As of January 2014, eight states that were formerly parties to the convention have withdrawn by denouncing it. These states are Canada (which withdrew on 30 June 1982), [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], [[Jamaica]], [[Mauritius]], [[Philippines]], the [[Seychelles]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=ratifications&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE REGULATION OF WHALING|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/191051.pdf|website=state.gov|publisher=Government of the United States|accessdate=5 July 2015|format=PDF|date=2 December 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belize]], [[Brazil]], [[Dominica]], [[Ecuador]], [[Iceland]], Japan, [[New Zealand]], and [[Panama]] have all withdrawn from the convention for a period of time after ratification but subsequently have ratified it a second time.&lt;ref name = ratifications/&gt; The [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] have all withdrawn from the convention twice, only to have accepted it a third time.&lt;ref name = ratifications/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2645">'''Jointure''' is, in [[law]], a provision for a wife after the death of her husband. As defined by Sir [[Edward Coke]], it is "a competent livelihood of freehold for the wife, of lands or tenements, to take effect presently in possession or profit after the death of her husband for the life of the wife at least, if she herself be not the cause of determination or forfeiture of it': (Co. Litt. 36b).

A jointure is of two kinds, legal and equitable. A legal jointure was first authorized by the [[Statute of Uses]]. Before this statute a husband had no legal [[seisin]] in such lands as were vested in another to his "use", but merely an equitable estate. Consequently, it was usual to make settlements on marriage, the most general form being the settlement by deed of an estate to the use of the husband and wife for their lives in joint tenancy (or "jointure") so that the whole would go to the survivor. Although, strictly speaking, a jointure is a joint estate limited to both husband and wife, in common acceptation the word extends also to a sole estate limited to the wife only.

The requisites of a legal jointure are:
# the jointure must take effect immediately after the husband's death;
# it must be for the wife's life or for a greater estate, or be determinable by her own act;
#it must be made before marriage; if after, it is voidable at the wife's election, on the death of the husband;
#it must be expressed to be in satisfaction of [[dower]] and not of part of it.

In equity, any provision made for a wife before marriage and accepted by her (not being an infant) in lieu of dower was a bar to such. If the provision was made after marriage, the wife was not barred by such provision, though expressly stated to be in lieu of dower; she was put to her election between jointure and dower.{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}

After marriage, a wife could bar her right to [[dower]] by a [[Fine of lands|fine]] being levied.  This meant that in practice, jointures could also be created by a post-nuptial settlement, provided the wife was willing.  Wives (or their relatives on their behalf) often paid their husband a lump sum (known as a portion) or otherwise handed over her property to him, in exchange for a jointure (usually being more than a third) being settled on her for life.  This might (in practice) be in the form of a share of the whole property or the right to a particular part of it or an annuity from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">In [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]], a '''law broker''' is a professional that assists individuals who are searching for a [[lawyer]].  A [[law]] [[broker]] will analyze an individual's case or [[legal]] issue and provide a customized referral to an appropriate lawyer. Some common factors that a law broker will consider are a lawyer's experience level, success rate, reputation, and quality of service. A law broker will often review legal publications, [[court decision]]s, and rely upon a network of legal contacts to provide an objective, customized referral to a client. 

The person who coined the term "law broker" was an Australian solicitor Dr. Yuri Rapoport of Kohen Rapoport Group.  He started the world's first law broking firm "Prime Law Brokers" in 1996, which paved the way for the development of the private-sector legal referral industry in Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom.  

== Fees ==

In most circumstances, a law broker does not charge a fee to a client but rather obtains a referral fee from the lawyer.

==In other countries==

In [[North America]], an equivalent service is provided by lawyer referral programs, which are usually operated by [[bar association]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3765">'''Michael John Egan''' (June 2, 1827 &amp;ndash; ?) was an [[United States|American]] [[merchant]] and [[insurance agent]] who served two years as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[Wisconsin State Senate]] and two as a member of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] from [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]].&lt;ref&gt;State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. "[http://lrbdigital.legis.wisconsin.gov/cdm/pageflip/collection/p16831coll2/id/1303/type/singleitem/pftype/pdf Members of the Wisconsin Legislature 1848&amp;ndash;1999]". Information Bulletin 99-1 (September 1999), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Egan was born in the city of [[Kilkenny]], [[Ireland]] on June 2, 1827. He graduated from [[St Kieran's College]] in Kilkenny in 1847. He came to [[Wisconsin]] in 1848, and settled at [[Franklin, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Franklin]]. He became a merchant by trade.

== Public office ==
He was a state senator in 1860 and 1861 from the [[Wisconsin Senate, District 6|Sixth District]] (3rd, 4th, 5th and 8th [[wards of the United States|Wards of the City of Milwaukee]], and the towns of Franklin, [[Greenfield, Wisconsin|Greenfield]], [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Lake]] [[Oak Creek, Wisconsin|Oak Creek]] and [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]]), succeeding fellow Democrat and native of Ireland [[Patrick Walsh (Wisconsin politician)|Patrick Walsh]]; during the 1861 session he was on the [[standing committee]]s on the [[militia]], on [[education]], [[school]], and [[university]] lands, on [[enrolled bill]]s, and on [[railroads]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1861 Crane, L.

As of 1882, he was working as an [[insurance agent]]. He had been chairman of the [[civil township|town]] board for fifteen years and chairman of the [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|County]] [[board of supervisors]] for several years, and a [[justice of the peace]] for thirty years, when he was elected to the Assembly's 12th Milwaukee County district (the towns of Franklin, Greenfield, Lake and Oak Creek) for 1883, receiving 979 votes, against 746 for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] R. M. Berry. (The district, formerly numbered the 11th until the decennial [[redistricting]], had previously been represented by Republican [[William M. Williams, Jr.]]; and had been represented by Patrick Walsh in 1868.) He was assigned to the standing committee on [[insurance]], [[bank]]s and [[banking]], and the [[joint committee]] on [[Land claim|claims]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1883 Heg, J. E., ed. ''The Blue Book of the State of Wisconsin 1883'' Madison, 1883; pp. 199, 498, 516, 517]&lt;/ref&gt; He was not a candidate for re-election in 1884, and was succeeded by Republican [[James Lemont]] (also a native of Ireland).

The '''National Digital Newspaper Program''' is a joint project between the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[Library of Congress]] to create and maintain a publicly available, online digital archive of historically significant newspapers published in the United States between 1836 and 1922.  Additionally, the program will make available bibliographic records and holdings information for some 140,000 newspaper titles from the 17th century to the present.  Further, it will include scope notes and encyclopedia-style entries discussing the historical significance of specific newspapers. Added content will also include contextually relevant historical information. "One organization within each U.S. state or territory will receive an award to collaborate with relevant state partners in this effort."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/ndnp.html National Digital Newspaper Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007 more than 226,000 pages of newspapers from California, Florida, Kentucky, New York, Utah, Virginia and the District of Columbia published between 1900 and 1910 were put online at a fully searchable site called "[[Chronicling America]]." [https://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/] As of December 2007, the total number of pages is about 413,000. This further expanded to be 1 million pages in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2009/09-123.html|title=Library of Congress, National Endowment for the Humanities Celebrate Millionth Page in Chronicling America Program|date=June 16, 2009 |publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding through the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] is carried out through their "We The People" initiative.

== Purpose ==
This project dovetails with the [[United States Newspaper Program]] which was a massive project to microfilm newspaper collections. The initiators of that earlier project asserted that the intellectual content of newspapers serves an important role for researchers as it is for all intents and purposes the first draft of history. Newspapers also provide unique access to "diverse geographic viewpoints at the community level."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlcnet.org/objects/rte/mediaupload/File/eventsdocs/events/05newspapers/05Sweeney-2_files/frame.htm The U.S. Newspaper Program ‚Äì Scope, Achievement, and Progress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Problematically, since the middle of the 19th century this "first draft" has been recorded on poor quality [[newsprint]] which is decaying rapidly. This digitization project's purpose is to continue preserving newspaper and newspaper collections while addressing the inadequacies of the prior program. Through digitization, it is more likely that images will be copied with fidelity and that the records will be more richly searchable. This latter point is huge as newspapers traditionally posed a research challenge due to density of text and inadequate cataloging of content.

== History ==
On March 31, 2004, [[Bruce Cole]], the directory of the NEH, and [[James H. Billington|James Billington]], the Librarian of Congress, signed an agreement creating the National Digital Newspaper Program.  The NDNP follows in the footsteps of the successful [[United States Newspaper Program]], a several-decade effort to catalog and microfilm the bulk of America's historic newspapers. The program is broken down into two phases. Each successive phase will both increase the scope of the program and refine the requirements for data collection.

=== Phase 1 ===
In July 2004 the award guidelines were issued. Applications were due in October and awardees were announced the following March. The first phase took newspapers from a small subset of the states, limited to 1900 through 1910.  After using this phase to improve technical requirements and specifications, the program was opened to other awardees in [[#Phase 2|Phase 2]].

The awardees for Phase 1 are:
* [[University of California, Riverside]]
* [[University of Florida Digital Collections|University of Florida Libraries]], Gainesville
* [[University of Kentucky#Libraries|University of Kentucky Libraries]], Lexington
* [[New York Public Library]], New York City
* University of Utah, Salt Lake City [http://www.lib.utah.edu/digital/unews/]
* Library of Virginia, Richmond

The General-access Phase 1 website prototype was implemented in March 2007 and that May it was announced that phase 1 was completed.

=== Phase 2 ===
Phase 2 of NDNP expanded grants to an additional group of institutions. Awards granted in 2007 and 2008 included the following institutions:

* [[Arizona State Library, Archives and Records Management]]
* [[University of Hawaii]]
* [[Minnesota Historical Society]]
* [[University of Nebraska, Lincoln]]
* [[University of North Texas]]
* [[Ohio Historical Society]], Columbus
* [[Pennsylvania State University]]
* [[State Historical Society of Missouri]]
* [[Washington State Library]]

== Program Technology ==
Participants must follow the technical guidelines laid out in a 64-page PDF.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/pdf/NDNP_200709TechNotes.pdf Ndnp: Technical Notes On Formats For Digital Reproductions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The technology for the NDNP digital repository is being built using largely [[Open-source software|open source]] software, including:
* [[Fedora (software)|Fedora]]
* [[Apache Cocoon]]
* [[Gentoo Linux]]
* [[Apache Lucene]]
Digital objects are stored in .TIFF 6.0, .JPEG 2000, and .PDF formats. Metadata is provided in the METS/MODS version of XML and XML provides the basis for larger hierarchical structures as well.

== Alternatives ==
The scanning efforts of the government entity has been dwarfed by the private efforts [[newspapers.com]] and [[newspaperarchive.com]] which as of March 2018 claim to each have scanned more than 350 million pages.  Publishers, libraries and historical organizations find the private sector faster, less complicated and cheaper than the National Digital Newspaper Program.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Both private organizations charge readers to read, but do not charge publishers to scan items.&lt;ref&gt;http://reason.com/blog/2014/05/18/a-retiree-digitizes-27-million-old-newsp&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''officer of arms''' is a person appointed by a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] or [[Sovereign state|state]] with authority to perform one or more of the following functions:

* to control and initiate [[Armory (heraldry)|armorial]] matters
* to arrange and participate in ceremonies of state
* to conserve and interpret [[heraldry|heraldic]] and [[genealogical]] records.

==By country==
The medieval practice of appointing heralds or pursuivants to the establishment of a [[Nobility|noble]] household is still common in [[Europe]]an countries, particularly those in which there is no official heraldic control or authority. Such appointments are also still made in [[Scotland]], where four [[Private Officer of Arms|private officers of arms]] exist.  These appointments are all purely advisory.

===Great Britain===


Traditionally in England, the authority of the thirteen officers of arms in ordinary, who form the corporation of the Kings, Heralds, and Pursuivants of Arms, extends throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], with the exception of [[Scotland]], [[Canada]] and [[South Africa]].  Officers of arms are of three ranks: [[King of Arms|kings of arms]], [[Herald|heralds of arms]], and [[Pursuivant|pursuivants of arms]].  Officers of arms whose appointments are of a permanent nature are known as ''officers of arms in ordinary''; those whose appointments are of a temporary or occasional nature are known as ''officers of arms extraordinary''. The officers of arms in ordinary who form the [[College of Arms]]  are members of the royal household and receive a nominal salary.

In Scotland, the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], and the Lyon Clerk and Keeper of the Records control matters armorial within a strict legal framework not enjoyed by their fellow officers of arms in London, and the court which is a part of Scotland's criminal jurisdiction has its own prosecutor, the court's [[Procurator Fiscal]], who is however not an officer of arms.  Lord Lyon and the Lyon Clerk are appointed by the crown, and, with the Crown's authority, Lyon appoints the other Scottish officers. The officers of arms in Scotland are also members of the royal household.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], matters armorial and genealogical come within the authority of an officer designated the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. The legal basis for Ireland's heraldic authority, and therefore all grants since 1943, has been questioned by the Attorney General,&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/chiefs/armscrisis.htm&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, on May 8, 2006 Senator Brendan Ryan introduced the Genealogy &amp; Heraldry Bill, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2006/2306/b2306s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in Seanad √âireann (Irish Senate) to remedy this situation and legitimise actions since the transfer of power from the [[Ulster King of Arms]].

===The Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]], officers of arms do not exist as permanent functions. Private heraldry is not legislated, and state heraldry and the heraldry of the nobility is regulated by the [[High Council of Nobility]]. During the royal inauguration ceremony however, two Kings of Arms and two or four Heralds of Arms have figured. These were usually members of the High Council of Nobility. During the inaugurations of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]] and [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Juliana]], the Kings of Arms wore nineteenth-century style [[court dress]], whereas the Heralds wore [[tabard]]s. All officers carried rods and wore chains of office.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ambtskostuums.nl/ambtskostuums/adel/wapenen.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the inauguration of [[Queen Beatrix]] in 1980, the ceremonial office was held by members of the [[Dutch resistance|resistance]], [[Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema]] being the elder King of Arms.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P.H. van Cruyningen, De inhuldiging van de Nederlandse vorst. Van Willem Frederik tot Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard (unpublished thesis, [[Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen]], 1989) 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other participants in the pageant the officers of arms were no longer wearing [[ceremonial dress]], but [[white tie]] instead. The senior King of Arms proclaims the King to be inaugurated after he or she has sworn allegiance to the constitution. The Heralds step outside the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|New Church]] in [[Amsterdam]], where the inauguration ceremony is held, to announce this fact to the people gathered outside the church.&lt;ref&gt;Van Cruyningen, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act''' ({{USBill|113|hr|2919}}) is a bill that would require the [[Administrative Conference of the United States]] (ACUS) to prepare a report each year on the amount of fees and other expenses awarded by federal courts to nonfederal entities when they prevail in a case against the United States.&lt;ref name="cbo2919"/&gt; The bill would amend the [[Equal Access to Justice Act]].&lt;ref name="2919sum"/&gt;

The bill was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
The Equal Access to Justice Act, when it was passed in 1980, originally required agencies and the Justice Department to "issue annual reports on the amount of money paid out under the law," but that reporting requirement was later ended in 1995.&lt;ref name="LummisPRAug1"/&gt; This bill would reinstate that requirement.

According to the office of Congresswoman Lummis, "Congress passed the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) as a means to help individuals, retirees, veterans, and small businesses recover attorney‚Äôs fees and costs associated with suing the federal government. Congress intended EAJA to remove a barrier to justice for those with limited access to the resources it takes to sue or defend against the federal government."&lt;ref name="LummisPRAug1"/&gt;

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=2919sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2919 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2919|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act would amend the [[Equal Access to Justice Act]] and the federal judicial code to require the Chairman of the [[Administrative Conference of the United States]] to report to Congress annually on the amount of fees and other expenses awarded to prevailing parties other than the United States in certain administrative proceedings and civil action court cases (excluding [[tort]] cases) to which the United States is a party, including settlement agreements.&lt;ref name="2919sum"/&gt;

The bill would require that such reports: (1) describe the number, nature, and amount of the awards, the claims involved in the controversy, and any other relevant information that may aid Congress in evaluating the scope and impact of such awards; and (2) be made available to the public online.&lt;ref name="2919sum"/&gt;

The bill would also direct the Chairman to create and maintain online a searchable database containing specified information with respect to each award including the name of the agency involved, the name of each party to whom the award was made, the amount of the award, and the basis for finding that the position of the agency concerned was not substantially justified.&lt;ref name="2919sum"/&gt;

The bill would direct the head of each agency (including, with respect to court cases, the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] ([[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]]) and the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts) to provide the Chairman all information requested to produce such reports.&lt;ref name="2919sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on February 5, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo2919&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 2919|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45145|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

H.R. 2919 would require the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) to prepare a report each year on the amount of fees and other expenses awarded by federal courts to nonfederal entities when they prevail in a case against the United States. The bill also would require the ACUS to create an online searchable database containing information about cases in which fees and expenses were awarded by courts or federal agencies. The ACUS is an independent agency that assists other agencies of the federal government in improving regulatory and other administrative procedures.&lt;ref name="cbo2919"/&gt;

Based on information from the ACUS, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 2919 would cost about $1 million in fiscal year 2015 and less than $500,000 each year thereafter, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. These funds would cover costs for additional ACUS staff, technological upgrades, and data collection by federal agencies. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.&lt;ref name="cbo2919"/&gt;

H.R. 2919 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo2919"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on August 1, 2013 by [[Cynthia Lummis|Rep. Cynthia M. Lummis (R, WY-0)]].&lt;ref name=2919allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2919 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2919/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] and the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice]].&lt;ref name="2919allactions"/&gt; The bill was scheduled to be voted on under [[suspension of the rules]] on May 6, 2014.&lt;ref name=HouseExIRS&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=The week ahead: House to hold ex-IRS official in contempt|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/205099-the-week-ahead-house-to-hold-ex-irs-official-in-contempt|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
Rep. Lummis, who introduced the bill, said that "requiring agencies to keep track of what they pay attorneys will help Congress determine if EAJA is working well or not."&lt;ref name=LummisPRAug1&gt;{{cite web|last=D'Amico|first=Christine|title=Lummis, Cohen Draft Bill to Track Equal Access to Justice Act Payments Bipartisan legislation restarts agency tracking obligations; modernizes record-keeping with online database.|url=http://lummis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=344957|publisher=House Office of Cynthia Lummis|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=1 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505234735/http://lummis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=344957|archivedate=5 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lummis, the EAJA was meant to the help the "little guy" but "was later co-opted by large environmental groups so their litigation shops could get reimbursed for filing expansive litigation on environmental issues."&lt;ref name=Casper9Feb&gt;{{cite news|last=Hancock|first=Laura|title=House committee endorses bill targeting environmental group lawsuits|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/house-committee-endorses-bill-targeting-environmental-group-lawsuits/article_e7aa8080-5f2e-5b61-a320-074b40ab0304.html|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=Casper Star Tribune|date=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rep. [[Steve Cohen]] (D-TN), an original co-sponsor of the bill, argued that "Americans have a right to know what their government is doing and their government has a duty to be as transparent as possible."&lt;ref name="LummisPRAug1"/&gt;

The [[National Association of Counties]] (NACO) strongly supported the bill because it "strives to create a balance between ensuring access to courts for individuals, small businesses, and non-profit organizations in suits against the federal government and preventing abuses of the system."&lt;ref name=NACOletter&gt;{{cite web|last=Chase|first=Matthew D.|title=Letter in Support of H.R. 2919|url=http://www.naco.org/legislation/policies/Documents/Public%20Lands/OBEAJA_Support_Letter_House_Judiciary_Committee.pdf|publisher=National Association of Counties|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to NACO, the "legislation provides necessary transparency in an effort to stop EAJA abuses," but allows "veterans, social security claimants, individuals, and small businesses" to "still enjoy full access to EAJA funds."&lt;ref name="NACOletter"/&gt;

}}'''Operation In Our Sites''' is an ongoing effort by the [[National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center]] in the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], to detect and hinder intellectual property violations on the Internet. Pursuant to this operation, governmental agencies arrest suspects affiliated with the targeted websites and seize their assets including websites' [[domain names]]. Web users intending to access targeted websites are directed to the server operated by the U.S. government, and greeted with a graphic bearing the seals of the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ), the [[National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center]] (NIPRCC), and [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE).

==Background==

===Legal background===
In 2008, the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008 ([[PRO-IP Act]] of 2008, H.R. 4279) was established to increase civil and criminal penalties for [[trademark]], [[patent]] and [[copyright infringement]]. The civil forfeiture provision of {{UnitedStatesCode|18|2323}} amended the PRO-IP Act and provided the legal basis of Operation In Our Sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=Tell The White House To Stop Illegally Seizing &amp; Shutting Down Websites|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120609/00050419257/tell-white-house-to-stop-illegally-seizing-shutting-down-websites.shtml|publisher=techdirt|accessdate=24 February 2014|date=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPEC2010&gt;{{cite web|title=IPEC 2010 ANNUAL REPORT|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/IPEC/ipec_annual_report_feb2011.pdf|publisher=Executive Office of the President|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provision provides that any property used to commit or facilitate infringement of intellectual property rights would be subject to forfeiture to the United States Government.

===Policy background===
To protect their intellectual property, major intellectual property owners and their representatives have strengthened U.S. government enforcement of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref name=EFF_Puerto80_1&gt;{{cite web |last1=McSherry |first1=Corynne |last2=Zimmerman |first2=Matthew |title=Amici Curiae brief of Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Democracy and Technology, and Public Knowledge in Support of Puerto 80'S Petition for Release of Seized Property |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |url=https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/2011-06-20-rojadirecta.pdf |accessdate=2 February 2014 |format=PDF |year=2011 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC), which was the position at the [[White House]] created by the PRO-IP Act through {{UnitedStatesCode|15|8111}} to coordinate U.S. governmental agencies that carry out the law's purpose,&lt;ref name=IPEC&gt;{{cite web|title=About IPEC|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/intellectualproperty/ipec|publisher=The Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; several policy rationales informed intellectual property enforcement, including:&lt;ref name=IPEC2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=2010 Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/intellectualproperty/intellectualproperty_strategic_plan.pdf|publisher=[[Executive Office of the President of the United States]]|accessdate=24 February 2014|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Growth of the U.S. economy, creation of jobs for American workers and support for U.S. exports;
* Promotion of innovation and security of America's comparative advantage in the global economy;
* Protection of consumer trust and safety;
* National and economic security; and
* Validation of rights as protected under U.S. Constitution

NIPRCC also reasoned that Operation In Our Sites would protect consumers' health and safety&lt;ref name=IOS&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation In Our Sites|url=http://www.iprcenter.gov/reports/fact-sheets/operation-in-our-sites/at_download/file|publisher=National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Operation In Our Sites targets websites that sell counterfeit medicine.&lt;ref name=ICE_Press_20121004&gt;{{cite press release |author= |title=HSI seizes 686 websites selling counterfeit medicine to unsuspecting consumers |url=http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/1210/121004washingtondc.htm |location= |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |agency=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |date=2012-10-04 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domain name seizure process==
"Operation In Our Sites was the most aggressive federal enforcement effort ever launched against copyright infringement online...the program would use an unprecedented tactic, site domain seizure, to shut down websites offering copyrighted material."&lt;ref name=AmerProspect /&gt;

The domain name seizure process used by Operation In Our Sites was codified in {{UnitedStatesCode|18|981|}}(b)(2), which provides a legal framework for property seizures by the government. Before the seizure, government officials are supposed to investigate suspected websites to find out if they actually purchase or access counterfeit items. The government then contacts the copyright holders to confirm ownership of the intellectual property and suspected infringement. Following the investigation, ICE and NIPRCC officials present the resulting evidence to the U.S. Attorneys, and check the domain name registration.&lt;br /&gt;If the domain name was registered in the U.S., the government petitions a [[United States magistrate judge|magistrate judge]] to issue a seizure warrant for the domain name. With the warrant, the domain name's title and rights are transferred to the U.S. government. After the seizure, the government is supposed to send a written notice of the forfeiture deadline to the website operator within 60 days from the seizure date. The website owner can file the claim against the government within 35 days after receiving the notice. If the owner files a claim, the government has 90 days to prove that the property is subject to forfeiture. If the owner does not make a claim against the seizure, or the government successfully proves a valid seizure, the domain name is forfeited to the government.&lt;ref name=Karen_Kopel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopel|first=Karen|title=Operation Seizing Our Sites: How the federal government is taking domain names without prior notice|journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal|date=2013-09-16|volume= 28, 2013|series=Number AR|url=http://btlj.org/data/articles/28_AR/0859-0900_Kopel_081413_Web.pdf|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=Breaking News: Feds Falsely Censor Popular Blog For Over A Year, Deny All Due Process, Hide All Details...|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111208/08225217010/breaking-news-feds-falsely-censor-popular-blog-over-year-deny-all-due-process-hide-all-details.shtml|work=Techdirt|publisher=Techdirt|accessdate=4 March 2014|date=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

{{see also|Asset forfeiture}}

==Result of domain name seizure==
[[File:IPRC Seized 2010 11.jpg|thumb|Notice displayed on domains seized November 2011 by [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]], [[NIPRCC]] and [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]]]]
After the seizure the domain name registry alters registered information about the domain name, including the IP address on its [[name server|domain name server]] (DNS), as property of the U.S. government. When a user intends to access the website from a domain that has been seized, DNS servers reply with the government server's IP address. Initially a user who attempts to access the targeted website is directed to the governmental server and faced with the agencies' banner; in March 2014 this changed and users are instead redirected to [[YouTube]] in order to watch [https://www.youtube.com/user/wwwICEgov ICE's campaign video].

==Outcome of the Operation In Our Sites==
It is unclear how effective Operation In Our Sites has been in preventing websites that harm the U.S. economy, but agencies ''have'' seized a significant amount of funds and counterfeit goods from targeted websites. In April and May 2012, both DOJ and ICE released figures indicating that they had seized more than $896,000 funds and $1,500,000 counterfeit goods on commercial websites as a part of the Operation In Our Sites.&lt;ref name=DOJ_Press_20120410&gt;{{cite press release |author= |title=Department of Justice Seizes More Than $896,000 in Proceeds From the Online Sale of Counterfeit Sports Apparel Manufactured in China |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/news/2012/apr/12-129.html |location= |publisher=U.S. Attorney's Office District of Columbia |agency=U.S. Attorney's Office District of Columbia |date=2012-04-10 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICE_Press_20120410&gt;{{cite press release |author= |title=More than $896,000 in proceeds seized from the online sale of counterfeit sports apparel manufactured in China |url=http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/1204/120410washingtondc.htm |location= |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |agency=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |date=2012-04-10 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DOJ_Press_20120511&gt;{{cite press release |author= |title=Department of Justice Seizes More Than $1.5 Million in Proceeds From the Online Sale of Counterfeit Sports Apparel Manufactured in China -Action Comes After Earlier Seizures of Another $896,000 in Proceeds |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/news/2012/may/12-173.html |location= |publisher=U.S. Attorney's Office District of Columbia |agency=U.S. Attorney's Office District of Columbia |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICE_Press_20120511&gt;{{cite press release |author= |title=More than $1.5M in proceeds seized from online sale of counterfeit sports apparel manufactured in China |url=http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/1205/120511washingtondc2.htm |location= |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |agency=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 2010 to late January 2014 the government has seized a total of 2,713 domain names&lt;ref name=ICE_Press_20140130&gt;{{cite press release |author= |title=Federal agencies seize more than $21.6 million in fake NFL merchandise during 'Operation Team Player': Over 50 people arrested; 5,000-plus websites seized in coordination with NFL |url=http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/1401/140130newyork.htm |location= |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |agency=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |date=2014-01-30 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of December 2013, the ICE government banners on seized domain names have been viewed more than 122 million times.&lt;ref name=ICE_Press_20131202&gt;{{cite press release |author= |title=ICE, international law enforcement agencies seize 706 domain names selling counterfeit merchandise Seizures come as US consumers flock to the Web for Cyber Monday shopping deals |url=http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/1312/131202washingtondc.htm |location= |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |agency=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |date=2013-12-02 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and commentary==

===Effectiveness for protecting intellectual property===

Intellectual property owners and their representatives are not surprisingly supportive of Operation In Our Sites to the government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Attorney General, ICE Announce Sweeping Anti-Piracy Initiative |url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=newsandviews&amp;news_month_filter=11&amp;news_year_filter=2010&amp;id=097C515F-4241-2DF4-8C25-1D111383D88D |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |date=2010-11-29 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Entertainment Industry Coalition Sends Letter to All Members of Congress Strongly Supporting Efforts by ICE to Combat Digital Theft and Counterfeiting of Movies, TV and other Products |url=http://www.mpaa.org/resources/7b050dbd-187c-41b3-b705-426ba048b1af.pdf |publisher=[[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists|AFTRA]], [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc.]], [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]], [[Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance|IFTA]], [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees|IATSE]], [[Motion Picture Association of America, Inc.|MPAA]], [[National Association of Theatre Owners|NATO]], [[News Corporation]], [[Screen Actors Guild|SAG]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.]], [[Universal City Studios LLC]], [[Viacom]], [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], and [[Warner Bros.

Accused website operators targeted by this program can circumvent Operation In Our Sites by registering a new domain name, one that cannot be regulated by the U.S., and easily resume operation.&lt;ref name=Sohn&gt;{{cite web|last=Sohn|first=David|title=Serious Questions about Domain Name Seizures|url=https://www.cdt.org/blogs/david-sohn/serious-questions-about-domain-name-seizures|publisher=Center for Democracy and Technology|accessdate=3 March 2014|date=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Due process critiques===
In light of the [[U.S. Constitution]], seizures without any opportunity for a hearing are limited to extraordinary situations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Fuentes v. Shevin|vol=407 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=67 |court= |date=1972 |url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/407/67/case.html |accessdate=2014-03-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but pursuant to Operation In Our Sites, others have pointed out that the government is allowed to seize a targeted domain name without any prior notice to the owner.&lt;ref name=Karen_Kopel/&gt; 
Other critics have voiced concern that domain name seizures could be used to circumvent the normal legal process in order to target websites that may prevail in full court.&lt;ref name=Wyden&gt;{{cite web|last=Wyden|first=Ronald|title=Letter from Sen. Ron Wyden to John Morton|url=http://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/?id=103d177c-6f30-469b-aba8-8bbfdd4fd197|accessdate=3 March 2014|date=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other critics point that Operation In Our Sites' one-sided process inevitably brings mistakes and overly broad seizures.&lt;ref name=Sohn /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
{{see also|Due process}}

===Negative impact on free speech===
Other critics have argued that seizures of domain through Operation in Our Sites prohibits access to the all content on the allegedly infringing websites, and thus has a negative impact on free speech. Some types of targeted websites contained non-infringing speeches and conversation (ex. discussions in a chat-room, conversations in the comment section of blog posts); since the seizure operation redirects all traffic from the website, effects are felt on all material including the legitimate content that should be protected by the [[First Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name=Karen_Kopel/&gt;&lt;ref name=EFF_Press_20110923&gt;{{cite press release |author1=Corynne McSherry |author2=Matt Zimmerman |title=Government Violates Free Speech Rights with Domain Name Seizure |url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2011/09/23 |location= |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |agency=Electronic Frontier Foundation |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, opponents of Operation In Our Sites have criticized ICE for erroneous seizure of non-infringing domain names, and the corresponding violation of the non-infringing domain holder's First Amendment rights. So far, three domain names (dajaz1.com, rojadirecta.com, and rojadirecta.org) have been seized by mistake and returned to their respective owners. 
* Dajaz1.com: Dajaz1.com was a popular hip-hop music blog that provided links to pre-released songs sent to Dajaz1.com by legitimate copyright holders for promotional purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sisario|first=Ben|title=Music Web Sites Dispute Legality of Their Closing |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/business/media/20music.html|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late November 2010, at the suggestion of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), ICE alleged that the links to the songs constituted copyright infringement, and seized the domain name pursuant to a warrant granted by a magistrate judge. After the seizure, the domain name owner filed a claim. Although the regular seizure process affords the government a 90-day period before filing a forfeiture claim, the agencies in this case secretly sought a prolonged time period which they acquired from the court, and in this instance the government held the domain name for a year without providing any notice to the owner. In November 2011, ICE returned the domain name to its owner without providing any explanation.&lt;ref name=Dajaz1&gt;{{cite web|title=ICE admits year-long seizure of music blog was a mistake|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/12/ice-admits-months-long-seizure-of-music-blog-was-a-mistake/|publisher=ars technica|accessdate=3 March 2014|author=Timothy B.

* In the RojaDirecta case, the government seized the domain name because the website's discussion board included links to copyrighted content.&lt;ref name=RojaD1&gt;{{cite news|last=Singel|first=Ryan|title=Oops! Copyright Cops Return Seized RojaDirecta Domain Names ‚Äì 19 Months Later|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/08/domain-names-returned/|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=Wired.com|date=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the seizure, Puerto 80, a Spanish company that operates rojadirecta.com and rojadirecta.org unsuccessfully attempted to appeal government authorities to resolve the domain names dispute without lawsuits.&lt;ref name=RojaD2&gt;{{cite web|title=Puerto 80 v. US|url=https://www.eff.org/cases/puerto-80-v-us|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto 80 filed a lawsuit, and in August 2012 the Court ordered the government to return the domain names.&lt;ref name=RojaD3&gt;{{cite court |litigants= United States of America v. rojadirecta.org and rojadirecta,com|vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=U.S. District Court Southern District of New York |date=2012-08-29 |url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/08/Endorsed-Order-Vacating-Seizure-Warrants.pdf |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in dajaz1.com, the government was criticized in the rojadirecta case for violating free speech, holding domain names for an extended period, and returning the domain names without any apology to the domain owners.

===Undercutting the DMCA===
Many domains targeted by Operation in Our Sites, including RojaDirecta&lt;ref name=RojaD1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RojaD2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RojaD3 /&gt; and Dajaz1.com,&lt;ref name=Dajaz1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dajaz2 /&gt; were seized because they provided [[hyperlink]]s ("linked") to allegedly infringing material. Critics argue that use of government intervention to prevent websites from linking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home     About     Our Work     Deeplinks Blog     Press Room     Take Action     Shop  In the Matter of the Seizure of the Internet Domain Name "DAJAZ1.COM"|url=https://www.eff.org/document/application-and-affidavit-seizure-warrant|work=Application and affidavit for seizure warrant|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to infringing materials undercuts the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] by eliminating the copyright holders' incentive for interacting cooperatively with [[Online service provider|OSPs]] through the DMCA established notice and takedown system. Prior to Operation in Our Sites, copyright holders had to submit takedown notices&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/05/30/0457143.pdf ''Perfect 10, Inc. v. CCBill, LLC'', 488 F.3d 1102, 1113 (9th Cir. 2007).]&lt;/ref&gt; to OSPs if they wished to have links to copyright protected material removed. OSPs that complied with the takedown notices and the safe-harbor provisions outlined in the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]] received relief from the financial burden of legal fees, and damages associated with claims of [[secondary liability| secondary liability for copyright infringement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html 17 U.S.C. ¬ß (512(c)(3)(A)(i-vi))]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(c)(3)(B)(ii)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(g)(2)(A)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.webtvwire.com/linking-to-infringing-content-is-probably-illegal-in-the-us/|title=Linking to infringing content is probably illegal in the US|publisher=WebTVWire|date=2006-09-12|accessdate=2006-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(c)(1)(C)]&lt;/ref&gt; If copyright holders forgo the notice and takedown provisions outlined in the DMCA and instead elect for direct government intervention through organizations like ICE, then the government may end up with sole responsibility for policing websites that link to copyright protected material. Furthermore, website owners will no longer have the ability to correct and improved wrongs without potentially facing criminal proceedings.&lt;ref name=Sellars&gt;{{cite web|last=Sellars|first=Andrew|title=Seized Sites: The In Rem Forfeiture of Copyright-Infringing Domain Names|ssrn=1835604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website owner lack of awareness===
Hana Beshara, the public face and co-founder of [[NinjaVideo]], was familiar with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and expected that her NinjaVideo website would be subjected to DMCA takedown notices from copyright holders in response to infringing links on NinjaVideo; she was shocked when her house was raided by [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] Officers. Following the raid Beshara pleaded guilty to criminal copyright infringement and was sentenced to 22 months in prison, 2 years of probation and a hefty fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120106/11034317305/ninjavideo-admin-phara-gets-22-months-jail-500-hours-community-service-has-to-pay-mpaa-210k.shtml |title=NinjaVideo Admin Phara Gets 22 Months In Jail, 500 Hours Of Community Service &amp; Has To Pay MPAA $210k |publisher=Techdirt |date=2012-01-06 |accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbying by the media industry===
In an article published in the bimonthly political magazine [[The American Prospect]], the author proposes that lobbying efforts on behalf of the media industry played a critical role in the adoption and implementation of Operation in Our Sites. The article further asserts that in the year prior to inception of Operation In Our Sites, large media conglomerates began providing ICE agents with lists of potential targets for the first round of raids.&lt;ref name=AmerProspect /&gt; ICE was for some time responsible for regulating and eliminating sales of counterfeit merchandise, but pressure from the entertainment industry, through lobbying and other efforts, expanded the agency's function to include enforcement against piracy.&lt;ref name=AmerProspect&gt;{{cite news|last=Fischer|first=Rob|title=A Ninja in Our Sites|url=http://prospect.org/article/ninja-our-sites|accessdate=20 March 2014|newspaper=The American Prospect|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobbying spending by the TV, music and movie industry did in fact increase dramatically from 2004 to 2010; it peaked at $123 million in 2011, then dropped to around $118 million where it stayed from 2012 to 2013.&lt;ref name=LobbyingNumbers&gt;{{cite web|last=OpenSecrets.Org|title=Annual Lobbying on TV/Music/Movies|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?id=B02&amp;year=2013|publisher=Center for Responsive Politics|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1233">In [[law]], the '''ordinary course of business''' covers the usual transactions, customs and practices of a certain business and of a certain firm. This term is used particularly to judge the validity of certain transactions.  It is used in several different sections of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] of the United States.

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/article1.htm#s1-201 Section 1-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code] defines a "Buyer in the ordinary course of business" by a four-part test:

# a person that buys goods in [[good faith]],
# without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person in the goods &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;e.g. a [[security interest]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
# and in the ordinary course from a person, other than a [[pawnbroker]], '''in the business of selling goods of that kind'''.
# A person buys goods in the ordinary course if the sale to the person '''comports with the usual or customary practices''' in the kind of business in which the seller is engaged or with the seller's own usual or customary practices.

[[File:Teststhermiques2.jpg|thumb|350px|Testing the [[thermal conductivity]] of a papercrete panel]]
'''Papercrete''' is a construction material which consists of re-pulped [[Paper|paper fiber]] with [[Portland cement]] or [[clay]] and/or other soil added. First patented in 1928, it was revived during the 1980s. Although perceived as an environmentally friendly material due to the significant recycled content, this is offset by the presence of cement. The material lacks standardisation, and proper use therefore requires care and experience. Eric Patterson and Mike McCain, who have been credited with independently "inventing" papercrete (they called it "padobe" and "fibrous cement"), have both contributed considerably to research into machinery to make it and ways of using it for building.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Manufacture==
The paper to be used can come from a variety of sources, including [[newspaper]], [[Advertising mail|junk mail]], [[magazine]]s, [[book]]s. A mixer is used to pulp the mix. Depending on the type of mixer, the paper may be soaked in water beforehand.

==Standardization and commercial acceptance==
As of 2007, papercrete lacks approval from the [[International Code Council]]. This limits its range of use within the city limits of most incorporated [[United States]] cities where building codes apply. It is not used as a load-bearing wall where building codes apply. However, its strength in model structures has been proven, and homes and small commercial buildings are being constructed. There is little or no evidence of its long-term durability at present.

In these small building projects, papercrete is being used as an in-fill [[wall]] in conjunction with [[structural steel]] [[Beam (structure)|beams]] or other load-bearing elements.

Papercrete gets its name from the fact that most formulas use a mixture of water and cement with cellulose fiber. The fiber is usually acquired from recycled newspaper, lottery tickets and phone books. The mixture has the appearance and texture of oatmeal and is poured into forms and dried in the sun, much like the process for making [[adobe]].

Dried papercrete has very low strength, but fails by slow compression (due to the large air content and hence compressibility) rather than in a [[brittle]] manner. Concrete and wood (though dry soft wood can be as high as R-2 per inch, high moisture content reduces this value markedly.) are not known for their insulating qualities; however, papercrete also provides good insulation.

Papercrete's [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] is reported to be within 2.0 and 3.0 per inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm); papercrete walls are typically 10 to 12&amp;nbsp;inches thick (about 25‚Äì30&amp;nbsp;cm). Unlike concrete or adobe, papercrete blocks are lightweight, less than a third of the weight of a comparably-sized adobe brick. Papercrete is mold resistant and has utility as a sound-proofing material.

Research tests into papercrete have been carried out by Barry Fuller in Arizona and Zach Rabon in Texas. Fuller directs government-funded research on papercrete through the [[Arizona State University]] [[Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering]]. He is also head of a subcommittee for the [[American Society for Testing and Materials]], and it is his goal to set standards that will lead to acceptance of the product within the architectural community and commercialization of the product, especially for affordable housing.

Structural tests have been completed on several papercrete formulas and Fuller claims the compressive strength of papercrete to be in the 140-160 psi range (0.96 - 1.1 MPa), while others like Kelly Hart claim 260 psi (1.7 MPa).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/papercrete.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, the compressive strength of concrete ranges from 15 MPa to over 70 MPa (2200 - 10000 psi) depending on the application. A more useful measure of papercrete's properties is its [[stiffness]] - i.e. the extent to which it compresses under load. Its stiffness is many times less than that of concrete, but sufficient for the support of roof loads in some low-height buildings.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Dried, ready-to-use papercrete has a rough surface. This increases its surface area and provides a very strong bond from one block to the next.

Papercrete has also been tested for its [[tensile strength]]. Fuller notes that a papercrete block is the equivalent of hundred of pages of paper - almost like a catalog. Papercrete has very good shear strength as a block. Lateral load involves sideways force - the wind load on the entire area of an outside wall for example. Because papercrete walls are usually a minimum of twelve inches thick, and usually pinned with [[rebar]], they may be strong laterally.

Zach Rabon founded Mason Greenstar in Mason, Texas for the purpose of producing and selling a commercially viable papercrete block. His product, Blox Building System, is at present the only mass-produced commercial papercrete block in the market. He has built several residential structures with it.

The Mason Greenstar block had its genesis in a journey Rabon's father, Kent Rabon, made to [[Marathon, Texas]]. The elder Rabon made the acquaintance of Clyde T. Curry, the proprietor of Eve's Garden Organic Bed &amp; Breakfast and Ecology Resource Center.

Mr. Curry was an early proponent of papercrete and benefited from the lack of building regulations in the small mountain community of Marathon. Curry built four of the rooms at the bed and breakfast either partially or entirely out of papercrete and is in the process of building two more, in addition to a library and reception area, entirely out of papercrete.
  
Papercrete's ready moldability provides considerable flexibility in the designed shape of structures. Domed ceilings/roofs may be commonly constructed with this material.

Along with Fuller's work at Arizona State University, Curry's establishment has become a resource center for people interested in papercrete, and workshops are intermittently held there.

The Rabons had prior experience as homebuilders and are owners of a ready-mix cement plant in Mason. They have invested in research and testing on their product for several years. However, they consider their product a proprietary formula. They have filed for a separate patent even though a patent for papercrete had already been filed in 1928. The block developed by Mason Greenstar is known for its uniform shrinkage (all papercrete blocks go through a lengthy dry-time that involves some shrinkage), giving it a sharper edge.

Fuller has remarked that in tests he has performed on the Rabon block, it has outperformed other formulas.

Papercrete is claimed to have benefit of being a project that involves little cost to start. The materials are claimed to be cheap and widely available. Machinery suitable for small-scale construction is simple to design and construct.

When properly mixed and dried, the papercrete wall can be left exposed to the elements. In its natural state, it is a grey, fibrous-looking wall. For a more conventional look, stucco can be applied directly to it.

A study model home made of papercrete has been built at the [[Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies]]. This study model is a sample of homes to be built for a [[sustainable]] community in Tijuana by students of [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]]

Since 2006 a small company based in England, [http://www.econovate.com Econovate Ltd] has developed, with the support of Cambridge and Bath University, a papercrete formula and production process for breeze blocks to be accepted by British Standard and a green certification for Europe. This new mixture of papercrete is to withstand the wet and harsh English weather. As of 2009 Econovate was in the process of developing this product and reaching manufacturing trials stage. A patent was filed in 2011 for the production process of breeze blocks with this material. De design of machinery was necessary to achieve a successful scale up of production. In January 2013 Econovate became fully funded to set up its first demonstration plant capable of producing up to 1.5m blocks a year which expected to achieve certification by October 2015. The company has tested the product at UKAS register testing houses for 18 rigours test such as fire, strength, moisture movement, acoustics, thermal, durability and others toward the product certification. This certification by LABC was achieved in dec 2015. The company was also in the process of achieving ISO 9001, 14001, 18001 and BS eN 6001 (responsible sourcing). Its ISO 9001 certification was achieved in October 2015. Econovate with its product Econoblok is producing a breeze blokc, UK standard size (440mmx215mmx100mm) with 5Mpa and another with 7Mpa. The difference between the two will be the amount of fibre within the mixture and this can range between 55% to 79%. The more strength the less fibre thus less thermal. After gaining Certification the company has increased production and the product is called "econoblok¬Æ". Initial commercialization will be in the UK until the production process is fully tested and ready for up scaling to a full size plant. From January 2017 the company will start preparing for the full size plant of 5-6 million block production, this will be based in the UK. Econovate plans to expand to other region of the world where some basic recycling system exist.

Compressive test on papercrete block reveals that papercreate can withstand load up to its [https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2017/august/318_89_Economical.pdf 30% axial compressive strain].

==Do it yourself==
Papercrete is rapidly gaining a groundswell of support among "do it yourself" builders.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} It is claimed to be a very attractive building material due to its very low cost, light weight, and high performance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Many owner/builders are contributing to furthering the technology and sharing their experiences over the internet through resources such as "Papercreters".

'''''Polleys v. Black River Improvement Co.''''', 113 U.S. 81 (1885), was a writ of error in the circuit court of Wisconsin for [[La Crosse County, Wisconsin|La Crosse County]], and a motion was made to dismiss it.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Polleys v. Black River Improvement Co.|113|81|1885}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first ground of the motion was that the writ should have been directed to the supreme court of the state instead of to the circuit court of the county. The circuit court denied the relief and dismissed the bill. On appeal, the supreme court of the state reversed this judgment and delivered an opinion that plaintiff was entitled to relief in the premises; 

It was claimed that the writ of error was not brought within the [[statute of limitations]], and although the writ of error was dated the tenth day of May 1884, and was noted by the clerk as having been filed on that day, it was also marked by the clerk of the circuit court of La Crosse county, as filed on the twenty-ninth day of that month. Since it was not disputed that this was the day it was filed in his office, it was held that this was the date on which the writ of error was brought. 

The courts of Wisconsin kept a book called a judgment docket containing the names of plaintiffs who recovered judgment, the defendants against whom they are recovered, the amount of the principal judgment, the costs, and the date of the judgment itself. This record is kept for the convenience of parties who seek information as to liens on real estate or for other purposes. 

This docket is made up after the main judgment is settled and entered in the order-book, or record of the court's proceedings, and it may be many days before this abstract of the judgment is made in the judgment docket, according to the convenience of the clerk. 

This record of the court's proceedings constitutes the evidence of the judgment, and the statute of limitations begins to run from that date. The writ of error in this case was brought five days after the two years allowed by law had expired and was thus dismissed.

'''Robert Jovicic''' ({{lang-sr|–†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç –à–æ–≤–∏—á–∏—õ/Robert Joviƒçiƒá}}) was a long-time resident of Australia who was deported to the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], where he became destitute in 2005.

Jovicic was born on 4 December 1966 in France of Yugoslavian parents. At the age of two, his family migrated to Australia, where Jovicic became an [[Australian permanent resident]] and lived for the next 36 years before being sent to Serbia. In Australia, Jovicic became addicted to heroin and turned to crime. By 2004 his criminal record numbered some 158 criminal convictions, mainly for burglary and theft.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/home-and-away--now-for-a-fresh-start/2006/03/09/1141701634127.html |title = Home and away ‚Äì now for a fresh start |work = The Sydney Morning Herald |date = 9 March 2006 |accessdate = 28 July 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070101052101/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/home-and-away--now-for-a-fresh-start/2006/03/09/1141701634127.html |archive-date = 1 January 2007 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004 his permanent residency was cancelled and he was detained, before being deported to [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], at the discretion of the then Australian Immigration Minister [[Amanda Vanstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2005/12/20/1534974.htm |title = Jovicic in court bid for return to Aust |publisher = ABC News |date = 20 December 2005 |accessdate = 28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/06/09/1659721.htm |title = Decision reserved in Jovicic visa case|work =  ABC News |publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date = 9 June 2006 |accessdate = 28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Government only obtained a 7-day visa for him, which meant he was unable to work, and, since he had not opted for Yugoslavian, specifically Serbian, citizenship within 3 years of turning 21 (which was a precondition to maintain citizenship by any of the six Yugoslavia's constituent republics at the time), the [[Yugoslavia|FRY]] authorities declared him stateless.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/national/stateless-man-fails-to-plead-his-case/2007/02/06/1170524084604.html|title=Stateless man fails to plead his case|publisher=theage.com|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jovicic turned up destitute and ill, sleeping rough in freezing temperatures outside the Australian embassy in the Serbian capital, [[Belgrade]], in late November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2005/s1515473.htm |work = Lateline |date = 23 November 2005 |title = Family pleads for deportees return |publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate = 28 July 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121108160829/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2005/s1515473.htm |archive-date = 8 November 2012 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His case was widely publicised in the Australian media, and there were calls for the Australian Government to reverse its cancellation of Jovicic's permanent residency. Jovicic's legal counsel have stated that he does not speak or understand the [[Serbian language]]. Jovicic's father was living in Serbia at the time, but he had his own problems (with alcohol) and his relationship his son was strained, so he was of little help.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; The Serbian government also does not have proper welfare system.

In March 2006, Senator [[Amanda Vanstone]] announced that Jovicic would be given a special purpose visa and allowed to return to Australia. She apparently promised the family through the then [[Department of Immigration and Citizenship|Department of Immigration, Multi-culturism and Indigenous Affairs]] (DIMIA) that he would be returned and given an RRV ([[Resident Return Visa]]). According to his lawyer and others he was also offered access to the new Reconnecting People Package,&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2006/s1588226.htm |work = Lateline |date = 9 March 2006 |title = Jovicic awaits residency decision |publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate = 28 July 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209104546/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2006/s1588226.htm |archive-date = 9 December 2007 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1610496.htm |title = PM ‚Äì Jovicic granted six-month visa |accessdate = 28 July 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121108160840/http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1610496.htm |archive-date = 8 November 2012 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is for the reintegration of those wrongly detained (it would seem that if this package was offered it has since been withdrawn). Jovicic returned to Australia on 9 March 2006, but to no certainty about his status.&lt;ref name="ref3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; This state of uncertainty continued for almost a year, until he was granted a two-year special protection visa on 19 February 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s1851663.htm |title = Jovicic granted 2-year special protection visa |accessdate = 28 July 2008 |work = PM |publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation |year = 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101215184825/http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s1851663.htm |archive-date = 15 December 2010 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Senator Vanstone's successor as Immigration Minister, [[Kevin Andrews (Australian politician)|Kevin Andrews]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23724">{{Canadian Charter}}
'''Section 2''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' ("''Charter''") is the section of the [[Constitution of Canada]] that lists what the ''Charter'' calls "fundamental freedoms" theoretically applying to everyone in Canada, regardless of whether they are a Canadian citizen, or an individual or [[corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html#s-2. | title = Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982 | accessdate = 2014-02-15 | author = Justice Laws Website, Site Web de la l√©gislation (Justice) | date = 2014-01-30 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140119183913/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html | archivedate = 2014-01-19 | quote = Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms}}&lt;/ref&gt; These freedoms can be held against actions of all levels of government and are enforceable by the courts. The fundamental freedoms are [[freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of thought]], [[freedom of belief]], [[freedom of assembly|freedom of peaceful assembly]] and [[freedom of association]].

[[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 1]] of the ''Charter'' permits Parliament or the provincial legislatures to enact laws that place certain kinds of limited restrictions on the freedoms listed under section 2. Additionally, these freedoms can be temporarily invalidated by [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 33]], the "notwithstanding clause", of the ''Charter''.

As a part of the ''Charter'' and of the larger ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'', section 2 took legal effect on April 17, 1982. However, many of its rights have roots in Canada in the 1960 ''[[Canadian Bill of Rights]]'' (although this law was of limited effectiveness), and in traditions under a theorized [[Implied Bill of Rights]]. Many of these exemptions, such as freedom of expression, have also been at the centre of [[Canadian federalism|federalistic]] disputes.

==Text==
Under the heading of "Fundamental Freedoms" the section states:
{{quote|2.  Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:

(a) freedom of conscience and religion;

(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;

(c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and

(d) freedom of association.}}

==Freedom of religion==
{{see also|Freedom of religion in Canada}}

===Background===
According to [[Beverley McLachlin]], freedom of religion in Canada may have originated as early as 1759, when [[French Canadian]] [[Roman Catholic]]s were allowed rights of worship by their British conquerors; this was later reconfirmed in 1774 in the ''[[Quebec Act]]''. Later the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' provided for denominational school rights&lt;ref&gt;Beverley McLachlin, "Freedom of Religion and the Rule of Law:  A Canadian Perspective," in ''Recognizing Religion in a Secular Society: Essays in Pluralism, Religion, and Public Policy''. Ed. Douglas Farrow. McGill-Queen's University Press, 2004, pages 17‚Äì18.&lt;/ref&gt; (these are reaffirmed by [[Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 29 of the ''Charter'']]). Discussions of church-state relations also took place in the [[Guibord case]] of 1874. In 1955, the Supreme Court ruled in ''Chaput v Romain'',&lt;ref&gt;[1955] SCR 834.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], that different religions have rights, based upon tradition and the [[rule of law]] (at the time no statutes formed the basis for this argument).&lt;ref&gt;McLachlin, "Freedom of Religion and the Rule of Law:  A Canadian Perspective," pages 19‚Äì20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious freedom was later included in the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''.  However, its effectiveness was limited. When Sunday closing laws compelling respect for the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Christian Sabbath]] were challenged in ''R v Robertson and Rosetanni'',&lt;ref&gt;[1963] SCR 651&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Ritchie of the Supreme Court found that non-Christians merely lost money when denied rights to work on Sunday and were otherwise free to believe in and observe their own religions.

===Definition===
Freedom of religion under section 2(a) of the ''Charter'' was first seriously considered by the Supreme Court in ''[[R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1985] 1 SCR 295.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, Chief Justice Brian Dickson wrote that this freedom at least includes freedom of religious speech, including "the right to entertain such religious beliefs as a person chooses, the right to declare religious beliefs openly and without fear of hindrance or reprisal, and the right to manifest religious belief by worship and practice or by teaching and dissemination." Freedom of religion would also prohibit imposing religious requirements. The immediate consequence of section 2, in this case, was the abolishment of federal Sunday closing laws.

In ''[[Syndicat Northcrest v Amselem]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2004 SCC 47.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court drew up a definition of freedom of religion under the ''[[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]'', mindful of the overlap with section 2(a). The majority found freedom of religion encompasses a right to religious practices if the individual has a sincere belief that the practice is connected to religion.  It would not matter whether the practice was needed according to religious authority.  If courts can believe an individual is telling the truth in saying a practice is connected to religion, the courts then ask whether the infringement of freedom of religion is severe enough to trigger section 2. The Court also said religious beliefs are vacillating, so courts trying to determine an individual belief should be mindful that beliefs may change. Following this test in ''[[Multani v Commission scolaire Marguerite‚ÄëBourgeoys]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2006 SCC 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court found freedom of religion should protect a non-violent [[Sikh]] student's right to wear a ''[[kirpan]]'' (dagger) in school.

In ''R v NS'',&lt;ref&gt;2012 SCC 72.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court sought to find a middle ground on the issue of whether a witness can wear a face-covering [[niqƒÅb]] while testifying in a criminal trial. The court found that the right to religious freedom must be balanced against the right of the accused to a fair trial.

===Freedom of conscience===
In addition to freedom of religion, section 2(a) also guarantees freedom of conscience. Professor [[Peter Hogg]] speculated this would include a right to [[atheism]], despite the [[preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which recognizes the "supremacy of God".&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W.  ''Canada Act 1982 Annotated.''  Toronto, Canada:  The Carswell Company Limited, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The right has not spawned a great deal of case law, although Justice [[Bertha Wilson]] did rely on it in her opinion in ''[[R v Morgentaler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1998] 1 SCR 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Finding laws against abortion to be a breach of the rights to [[liberty]] and [[security of the person]] under [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7 of the ''Charter'']], Wilson then argued this infringement could not be justified as being consistent with [[fundamental justice]]. The legal protections found under fundamental justice could be defined as including other rights under the ''Charter'', and in particular abortion laws breached freedom of conscience. As she wrote, the "decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is essentially a moral decision, a matter of conscience". She then said, "[C]onscientious beliefs which are not religiously motivated are equally protected by freedom of conscience in s. 2(a)." No other judges joined Wilson's opinion.

[[Jean Chr√©tien]], who was the [[Attorney General of Canada|attorney general]] during negotiations of the ''Charter'', later recalled in his memoirs that freedom of conscience was nearly excluded from the ''Charter''. The federal and provincial negotiators found the right too difficult to define, and Chr√©tien eventually agreed to remove it. A legal advisor for the federal government, Pierre Genest, then kicked Chr√©tien's chair, prompting Chr√©tien to joke, "I guess we leave it in. [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau's]] spy just kicked me in the ass."&lt;ref&gt;Chr√©tien, Jean. ''Straight from the Heart''. (Key Porter Books Limited, 1994), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of expression==
{{see|History of free speech in Canada}}
Freedom of expression, section 2(b), is perhaps one of the most significant ''Charter'' rights in influencing Canadian society.  The right is expressly named in the charter because although "Canadian criminal law uses the standard of the [[reasonable person]] as a&amp;nbsp;... definition for the threshold of criminality", the ''Charter'' expressly limits some forms of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Mikus, Rudolf Alexander. (1995). The reasonable person in substantive Canadian Criminal Law (T). Retrieved from https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/831/items/1.0077473&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice [[Peter Cory]] wrote that it "is difficult to imagine a guaranteed right more important to a democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edmonton Journal v Alberta (AG)]]'', [1989] 2 SCR 1326 at 1336.&lt;/ref&gt;  The section has been at the centre of a great amount of case law.

===Background===
Freedom of speech had a limited background in Canada. It has been an issue in federalism disputes, as provincial legislation infringing upon free speech has been taken as criminal legislation, which only the [[Parliament of Canada]] can validly create under section 91(27) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''.  ''[[Switzman v Elbling]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1957] SCR 285.&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a case in which this was discussed. An Implied Bill of Rights theory further stated governments were limited in their abilities to infringe upon free speech by virtue of the [[preamble]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''. This preamble states Canada's constitution would be based upon Britain's, and Britain had limited free speech in 1867.  Furthermore, free speech is considered to be necessary for a parliamentary government to function.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free speech was later included in the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''.

===Definition===
The meaning of "expression" within section 2(b) has been read broadly as including any activity that conveys, or attempts to convey, meaning&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irwin Toy Ltd v Quebec (AG)]]'', [1989] 1 SCR 927 [''Irwin Toy''].&lt;/ref&gt; to the exception of acts of violence and threats of violence.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Ibid'' and ''[[United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1518 v KMart Canada Ltd]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Courts have tried to maintain content neutrality by not considering the value of the expression. Instead, the content is only examined during the section 1 analysis.

Freedom of expression is primarily seen as a [[negative and positive rights|negative right]]. In ''[[Native Women's Assn of Canada v Canada|Native Women's Association of Canada v Canada]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1994] 3 SCR 627.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court considered a claim that the government had to financially support an interest group in constitutional negotiations, as it had supported others. [[Section Twenty-eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 28]] (sexual equality under the ''Charter'') was used to reinforce this argument, since the rights claimants were an interest group. Still, while the Supreme Court agreed discussions with the government is "unquestionably" a form of expression, the government did not seem to be guilty of suppressing any expression and thus the claim was dismissed.

===Limiting the right===
A law will be found to violate the freedom of expression where the law either has the purpose or effect of violating the right.

A law's purpose can limit the right either through limiting the content or form of expression. Limits on content are where the meaning of the expression is specifically forbidden by the law, such as hate-speech law, and is the most easily identifiable form of limitation.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''[[Prostitution Reference|Reference Re ss 193 &amp; 195.1(1)(c) of Criminal Code (Canada)]]'', [1990] 1 SCR 1123 [''Prostitution Reference'']; ''[[R v Keegstra]]'', [1990] 3 SCR 697; and ''[[R v Butler]]'', [1992] 1 SCR 452.&lt;/ref&gt; Limiting the form of the expression can often invoke section 2(b) as it will often have the effect of limiting the content as well.&lt;ref&gt;For example, instead of banning [[rock music]] (the content), banning [[FM radio]] (the method of conveying the music).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a law does not intend to limit the freedom of expression it may still infringe section 2(b) through its effects.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ramsden v Peterborough (City of)]]'', [1993] 2 SCR 1084.&lt;/ref&gt; A law will be found to restrict expression if it has the effect of frustrating "the pursuit of [[truth]], participation in the community, or individual self-fulfillment and human flourishing".

===Commercial expression===
Commercial expression is recognized as an activity protected under section 2(b). This includes advertising and any other similar means of expression used to sell goods and services. In fact, even false or misleading advertising is protected. The value of the expression does not come into play until the section 1 analysis.

The protection of commercial expression was first established in ''[[Ford v Quebec (AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1988] 2 SCR 712.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court struck down a Quebec law requiring all signs to be exclusively in French. This was soon followed by ''Irwin Toy'',&lt;ref&gt;''Supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court found that Quebec law prohibiting advertising to children to violate section 2(b) but was saved under section 1.

The Supreme Court has also found that restrictions on advertising by professionals to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rocket v Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario]]'', [1990] 2 SCR 232.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, even communications for the purpose of prostitution was found to be protected as commercial expression.&lt;ref&gt;''Prostitution Reference'', ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Picketing===
Protesting by labour groups and trade unions have long been recognized as a protected form of expression.

There are not many instances of limiting primary picketing. Typically, the debate has been over whether [[secondary picketing]] can be restricted; the practice of picketing businesses not directly involved in a labour dispute has in the past been banned under the common law. The most significant decision on limiting primary picketing is ''[[British Columbia Government Employees' Union v British Columbia (AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1988] 2 SCR 214.&lt;/ref&gt; where employees at the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]], who were protesting as part of a province-wide public service employee strike, were ordered back to work by the Chief Justice of the court. The order was found to clearly violate section 2(b) but the Supreme Court upheld it on section 1.

===Freedom of thought, belief and opinion===
Section 2(b) guarantees freedom of thought, belief and opinion in addition to freedom of expression. However, some have argued that freedoms of thought, belief and opinion in the ''Charter'' have had little practical consequence, and question whether governments have the capacity to stifle unspoken thoughts in any case.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 917.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application in the civil context===
The need to protect freedom of expression is considered a guiding principle of interpretation in civil cases between individuals. In '' Crookes v. Newton'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chartercases.com/crookes-v-newton-2011-scc-47/]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the Supreme Court of Canada found that section 2(b) must be considered in determining the extent to which common law libel restrictions should apply to new technologies such as internet hyperlinks.

==Freedom of peaceful assembly==
[[File:Occupy Montreal - Global Day of Action - 2011-10-15 - Victoria Square - General assembly.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Occupy Canada]] stages a peaceful assembly in Victoria Square in Montreal.]] 
Freedom of peaceful assembly under section 2(c) has not had a major impact on the case law.  In ''[[Reference Re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1987] 1 SCR 313 [''Alberta Reference''].&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court found that despite being written as a separate right, it was closely related to freedom of expression. The [[Nova Scotia Supreme Court]] defined it in ''Fraser et al v AGNS et al'' (1986) as including rights to meet as part of a committee or as workers. If there are membership fees to attend a meeting, prohibitions on being able to spend money for membership would be an abridgement of the right to peaceful assembly. In 2011, [[Occupy Canada]]'s protests in public parks raised questions of whether their eviction was prohibited by freedom of assembly, as well as expression and association.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Gollom, "[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2011/11/17/occupy-protest-rights.html Will charter protect Occupy protesters from eviction?]", CBC News, 18 November 2011, URL accessed 18 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of association==
Freedom of association is guaranteed under section 2(d). This right provides individuals the right to establish, belong to and maintain to any sort of organization, unless that organization is otherwise illegal. Generally, this is used in the [[Labour movement|labour]] context where employees are given the right to associate with certain [[trade union|unions]] or other similar group to represent their interests in labour disputes or negotiations.

It is important to note that this right only protects the right of individuals to form associations and not associations themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Alberta Reference'', ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, government legislation affecting the powers of established labour associations do not necessarily invoke section 2(d). It is only where legislation restricts the associative nature of an activity will section 2 be invoked. However, in the landmark ''Health Services and Support ‚Äì Facilities Subsector Bargaining Association v British Columbia'',&lt;ref&gt;2007 SCC 27 [''Health Services''].&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that freedom of association guaranteed by section 2(d) includes a procedural right to collective bargaining. The Court ruled in this case that legislation that "substantially interferes" with the process of collective bargaining is a section 2(d) infringement. The test for "substantial interference" is twofold: (1) the importance of the matter affected to the process of collective bargaining, and more specifically, the capacity of union members to come together and pursue collective goals in concert; and (2) the manner in which the measure impacts on the collective right to good faith negotiation and consultation.&lt;ref&gt;''Health Services'', ''supra'' at 394.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not certain whether the decision in ''Health Services'' overturns jurisprudence arising from the so-called "labour trilogy" cases of 1987 which found that section 2(d) did not include a right to collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;''Health Services'', ''supra'' at 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court has since found in ''Ontario (AG) v Fraser'',&lt;ref&gt;2011 SCC 20 [''Fraser''].&lt;/ref&gt; that the right to collective bargaining does not require government to take an active role in promoting and fostering collective bargaining, but merely to refrain from excessive interference with the collective bargaining process. In effect, the right to collective bargaining "guarantees a process, not a result". ''Fraser'' was affirmed and expanded upon by the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] in 2012 in ''Association of Justice Counsel v Canada (AG)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Association of Justice Counsel v. Canada (Attorney General)|link=Association of Justice Counsel v. Canada (Attorney General)|year=2012|court=onca|num=530|format=onca|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, where a union is denied a right it does not preclude the employees from forming a separate association. In ''[[Delisle v Canada (Deputy AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1999] 2 SCR 989.&lt;/ref&gt; members of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] were excluded from the public services legislation. The Supreme Court held that they were not precluded from forming their own association outside of the impugned legislation. However, in contrast the decision of ''[[Dunmore v Ontario (AG)]]''&lt;ref&gt;2001 SCC 94.&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that agricultural workers who were excluded from provincial labour relations legislation were entitled to be included because individually they were unable to form their own associations, and consequently, this imposed a duty upon the government to include them.

The freedom of association also includes the freedom not to associate.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lavigne v Ontario Public Service Employees Union]]'', [1991] 2 SCR 211 [''Lavigne''].&lt;/ref&gt; In certain employment circumstances, employees are required to contribute to a union as conditions of their employment (see [[Rand formula]]). However, mandatory associations do not invoke section 2(d) in and of themselves. In ''Lavigne'', the Court found that the right not to be associated extended only to where the association supported causes that went beyond what is necessary for employee representation. More generally, the Supreme Court had stated that the right is violated only when the mandatory association imposes "ideological conformity".&lt;ref&gt;''R v Advance Cutting &amp; Coring Ltd'', 2001 SCC 70 [''Advance Cutting &amp; Coring''].&lt;/ref&gt; Such violations have also mostly been found by the Supreme Court to be justified under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]], resulting in a right not to associate that has more theoretical than practical effects.

In ''Advance Cutting &amp; Coring'',&lt;ref&gt;''Supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court was called to examine the constitutional validity of a Quebec law that required all persons working in the province's construction industry to join a designated union. Eight of nine judges (Justice [[Claire L'Heureux-Dub√©]] dissenting) confirmed that section 2 includes, to at least some degree, the negative right to ''not'' associate. With a majority of five judges to four, the Court determined that the law at issue violated this right. But with the same majority (judge [[Frank Iacobucci]] "switching camps" on the two issues and citing a "unique and complex historical context" in Quebec), the Court deemed the law to be ''justified in a free and democratic society'' under section 1 and thus constitutional.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18019">'''Strangulation''' in the context of [[domestic violence]] is a potentially lethal form of [[assault]]. Unconsciousness may occur within seconds of strangulation and death within minutes. Strangulation can be difficult to detect and until recently{{when|date=December 2015}} was often not treated as a serious crime. However, in many jurisdictions strangulation is now a specific criminal offense, or an aggravating factor in assault cases.

==Differences from choking==

Although sometimes the words are used interchangeably, "strangulation" and "choking" are not the same thing. Choking is when air flow is blocked by food or a foreign object in the trachea ‚Äì something that can be addressed by the [[Heimlich maneuver]]. Strangulation, by contrast, is defined by reduced air flow and/or blood flow to or from the brain via the intentional external compression of blood vessels or the airway in the neck.  Notably, however, many victims of strangulation refer to the assault as "choking".

Manual strangulation (i.e., gripping the throat with one‚Äôs hands) is the most common method of strangulation in intimate partner violence, although ligatures (e.g., belts, scarves) are sometimes used.

==Epidemiology==

A systematic review of 23 articles based on 11 surveys in 9 countries (N=74,785, about two-thirds of whom were women) found that 3.0% to 9.7% of women reported that they had at some time been strangled by an intimate partner.&lt;ref name="Sorenson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sorenson SB, Joshi M, Sivitz E | year = 2014 | title = A systematic review of the epidemiology of nonfatal strangulation, a human rights and health concern | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 104 | issue = 11| page = e54-e61 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2014.302191 | pmid=25211747}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 0.4% to 2.4% ‚Äì with 1.0% being typical ‚Äì reported that they had experienced it in the past year, and women were between 2 times and 14 times more likely to be strangled by an intimate partner than were men.&lt;ref name="Sorenson" /&gt;

The most recent national survey in the U.S. that asked about strangulation by an intimate partner asked 16,507 adults (55% of whom were women) if a partner had tried to hurt them by choking or suffocating them. A total of 9.7% responded that a partner had done so at some point in their lifetime; 0.9% reported that it had happened during the past year.&lt;ref&gt;Black MC, Basile KC, Breiding MJ., et al. The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 summary report. Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011. https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of strangulation appears to be decreasing in Canada, the only country with multiple cross-sectional surveys that measure strangulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=The elevated risk for violence against cohabiting women: A comparison of three nationally representative surveys of Canada |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2008 |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=809‚Äì832 |doi=10.1177/1077801208320368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major study of surviving victims of strangulation assault found that 99% of the 300 victims in criminal cases involving "choking" were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Strack G, McClane G, Hawley D |title=A review of 300 attempted strangulation cases ‚Äì Part I: Criminal legal issues |journal=Journal of Emergency Medicine |year=2001 |volume=21 |pages=303‚Äì309 |doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, a meta-analytic review of gender differences in physical aggression against a heterosexual partner concluded that ". ..'choke or strangle' is very clearly a male act, whether based on self- or partner reports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Archer J |title=Sex differences in physically aggressive acts between heterosexual partners: a meta-analytic review |journal=Psychological Bulletin |year=2000 |volume=126 |issue=5 |pages=651‚Äì680 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651 |pmid=10989615}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar conclusion was reached in a 2014 multi-nation review: "‚Ä¶women are more likely than men to report that they were strangled by an intimate partner."&lt;ref name="Sorenson" /&gt;

A series of studies conducted in Canada found the same gender discrepancy and reported that strangulation by an intimate is more common among disabled persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=Partner violence against women with disabilities: prevalence, risk, and explanations |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2006 |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=805‚Äì822 |doi=10.1177/1077801206292681}}&lt;/ref&gt; cohabiting (vs. married) persons,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=Understanding women's heightened risk of violence in common-law unions: Revisiting the selection and relationship hypotheses |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2004 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=626‚Äì651 |doi=10.1177/1077801204265017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those in a step- (vs. biological) family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=Male partner violence against women in stepfamilies: an analysis of risk and explanations in the Canadian milieu |journal=Violence Vict |year=2004 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=17‚Äì36| doi=10.1891/vivi.19.1.17.33239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who had been abused by an intimate partner reported higher rates of strangulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Barrett BJ, St. Pierre M |title=Variations in women‚Äôs help seeking in response to intimate partner violence: findings from a Canadian population-based study |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2011 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=47‚Äì70 |doi=10.1177/1077801210394273 |pmid=21199809}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Macmillan R, Gartner R |title=When she brings home the bacon: Labor-force participation and the risk of spousal violence against women |journal=J Marriage Fam |year=1999 |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=947‚Äì958 |doi=10.2307/354015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strangulation is sometimes fatal. According to a large U.S. case control study, prior strangulation is a substantial and unique predictor of attempted and completed homicide of women by a male intimate partner. The study showed that the odds of becoming an attempted homicide victim increased 7-fold and the odds of becoming a homicide victim increased 8-fold for women who had been strangled by their partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Glass N, Laughon K, Campbell JC |title=Non-fatal strangulation is an important risk factor for homicide of women |journal=J Emerg Med |year=2008 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=329‚Äì335 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2007.02.065|display-authors=etal|pmc=2573025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When over three dozen other characteristics of the victim, perpetrator, and incident were taken into account, however, strangulation no longer was a unique predictor.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Campbell JC, Webster D, Koziol-McLain J |title=Risk factors for femicide in abusive relationships: results from a multisite case control study |journal=Am J Public Health |year=2003 |volume=93 |issue=7 |pages=1089‚Äì1097 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.93.7.1089|display-authors=etal|pmc=1447915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strangulation is so common in battering (50% or more battered women report that they've been strangled) that it doesn't differentiate abuse in which the victim survives or dies.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;

==Experience of strangulation==

Strangulation has been likened to drowning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Kristie A. | last2 = Joshi | first2 = Manisha | last3 = Sorenson | first3 = Susan B. | title = "Do you know what it feels like to drown?": strangulation as coercive control in intimate relationships | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 124‚Äì137 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0361684313488354 | date = March 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0361684313488354 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1190&amp;context=spp_papers Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Home page |url=http://www.ortnercenter.org/ | website = ortnercenter.org | publisher = Evelyn Jacobs Ortner Center on Family Violence, University of Pennsylvania }}&lt;/ref&gt; have likened non- or near-fatal strangulation to water boarding,&lt;ref name="Sorenson" /&gt; which is widely considered a form of torture.

A special issue of the ''Domestic Violence Report'' devoted to the crime of strangulation states: "Many domestic violence offenders and rapists do not strangle their partners to kill them; they strangle them to let them know they can kill them‚Äîany time they wish. Once victims know this truth, they live under the power and control of their abusers day in and day out."&lt;ref name="Domestic Violence Report"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Law reform targets the crime of strangulation |journal=Domestic Violence Report |date = August‚ÄìSeptember 2014 |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=81‚Äì100 |url=http://www.civicresearchinstitute.com/nfjca.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.civicresearchinstitute.com/pdfs/DVR1906.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

Strangulation can produce minor injuries, serious bodily injury, and death. Evidence of the assault can be difficult to detect because many victims may not have visible injuries and/or their symptoms may be nonspecific.

Victims may have internal injuries, such as laryngo-tracheal injuries, digestive tract injuries, vascular injuries, neurological system injuries and orthopedic injuries. Clinical symptoms of these internal injuries may include neck and sore-throat pain, voice changes (hoarse or raspy voice or the inability to speak), coughing, swallowing abnormalities, and changes in mental status, consciousness and behavior. Neurological symptoms may include vision changes, dimming, blurring, decrease of peripheral vision and seeing "stars" or "flashing lights."  Post-anoxic encephalopathy, psychosis, seizures, amnesia, cerebrovascular accident and progressive dementia may be indicative of neuropsychiatric effects.&lt;ref name="Domestic Violence Report" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Joshi | first1 = Manisha | last2 = Thomas | first2 = Kristie A. | last3 = Sorenson | first3 = Susan B. | title = "I didn't know I could turn colors": health problems and health care experiences of women strangled by an intimate partner | journal = Social Work in Health Care | volume = 51 | issue = 9 | pages = 798‚Äì814 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00981389.2012.692352 | pmid = 23078012 | date = October 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00981389.2012.692352 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=spp_papers Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Malek AM, Higashida RT |year=2000 |title=Patient presentation, radiographic features, and treatment of strangulation-induced bilateral dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=92 |pages=481‚Äì487 |pmid=10701540 |doi=10.3171/jns.2000.92.3.0481|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malek AM, Higashida RT, Phatouros CC, Halbach VV |title=A strangled wife |journal=Lancet |volume=353 |issue=9161 |pages=1324 |year=1999 |pmid=10218532 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)12179-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milligan N, Anderson M |title=Conjugal disharmony: a hitherto unrecognised cause of strokes |journal=Br Med J |volume=281 |issue=6237 |pages=421‚Äì2 |year=1980 |pmid=7427300 |pmc=1713281 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.281.6237.421|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith DJ, Mills T, Taliaferro EH |title=Frequency and relationship of reported symptomology in victims of intimate partner violence: the effect of multiple strangulation attacks |journal=J Emerg Med |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=323‚Äì9 |year=2001 |pmid=11604297 |doi= 10.1016/s0736-4679(01)00402-4|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valera EM, Berenbaum H |title=Brain injury in battered women |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=797‚Äì804 |year=2003 |pmid=12924684 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some visible signs of strangulation a victim should look for are injuries to their face, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, chin, neck, head, scalp, chest and shoulders, including: redness, scratches or abrasions, fingernail impressions in the skin, deep fingernail claw marks, ligature marks ("rope burns"), thumbprint-shaped bruises, blood-red eyes, pinpoint red spots called "petechiae" or blue fingernails.&lt;ref&gt;publication by Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention and the California District Attorneys Association|appendix 25| title= Facts That Victims of Choking (Strangulation )Need to Know!|year= 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==

For many years across the country, prosecutors have failed to treat non- and near-fatal strangulation assaults as serious crimes, largely due to the lack of physical evidence.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Because of involvement of the medical profession, specialized training for police and prosecutors, and ongoing research, strangulation has become a focus of policymakers and professionals working to reduce intimate partner violence and sexual assault..&lt;ref name="Robert Lee Bolton III, Strangulation as a Felony Offense: A New Penalty Under W.

As of November 2014, 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, the federal government and two territories have some form of strangulation or impending breathing statute.&lt;ref name="National District Attorneys Association"&gt;{{cite web |work=National District Attorneys Association |title=Strangulation / Impeded Breathing |url= http://www.ndaa.org/pdf/strangulation_statutory_compilation_11_7_2014.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-three states and one territory have enacted legislation making strangulation a felony.&lt;ref name="National District Attorneys Association" /&gt; One state legislature, Utah, passed a joint resolution which made legislative findings that can help prosecutors apply existing assault statutes with a special emphasis on non-fatal strangulation assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Strangulation and Domestic Violence. Joint Resolution, 2010 General Session |work=State of Utah |url=http://le.utah.gov/~2010/bills/static/HJR006.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Congress re-authorized the [[Violence Against Women Act]] and added, for the first time, strangulation and suffocation as a specific federal felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=U.

==Improving detection and intervention==

Starting in 1995, the work of Gael Strack and Casey Gwinn in San Diego has helped identify and address challenges in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting strangulation and suffocation offenses in intimate partner violence, sexual assault, elder abuse, and child abuse cases.  In 2011, Strack and Gwinn created the Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention, the most comprehensive training program in the United States for the documentation, investigation, and prosecution of non and near-fatal strangulation assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention. |url=http://www.strangulationtraininginstitute.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have published multiple state-specific books to guide the investigation and prosecution of non and near-fatal strangulation assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Strack G, Gwinn C. |title=On the edge of a homicide: Strangulation as a prelude |journal=Criminal Justice |year=2011 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=32‚Äì36 |url=  https://www.strangulationtraininginstitute.com/file-library/on-the-edge-of-homicide-strangulation-as-a-prelude-strack-and-gwinn-2011-pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Published appellate opinions have begun to proliferate across the United States as courts are upholding felony strangulation convictions even with minimal external visible injury to the victims.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  The importance of multi-disciplinary responses by doctors, nurses, advocates, police officers, and prosecutors has become clear in properly identifying, treating, investigating, and prosecuting strangulation assaults.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

'''Total element long-run incremental cost''' ('''TELRIC''') is a calculation method that the [[United States]] [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) requires [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]s (ILECs) to use to charge [[competitive local exchange carrier]]s (CLECs) for [[interconnection]] and [[Colocation centre|colocation]], effectively imposing a [[price ceiling]]. A variant of [[LRIC|long-run incremental cost]] (LRIC), it "measures the forward-looking incremental cost of adding or subtracting a [[network element]]" from a hypothetical system (that is efficient and uses current technologies). This allows the incumbent to recover a share of the [[fair value]] of their inputs in the long run.&lt;ref name=body&gt;{{cite web|author1=Eric P. Chiang|title=What are common cost models used for determining interconnection tariffs and how do they deal with common costs?|url=http://regulationbodyofknowledge.org/faq/telecommunication-regulation-interconnection/what-are-common-cost-models-used-for-determining-interconnection-tariffs-and-how-do-they-deal-with-common-costs/|website=Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation|publisher=[[University of Florida]] Public Utility Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The FCC used the [[telecommunications]] term for the first time when it interpreted TELRIC's role under the [[1996 Telecommunications Act]], which had been based on a higher level of ILEC unbundling. In short, the act assumed that "ILECs would have to [[lease]] components of the local telephone network to prospective competitors", who would then "expect to blend these components together, possibly using their own elements to offer appropriate services to end users".&lt;ref name=tech&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cory Janssen|title=Total Element Long Run Incremental Cost (TELRIC)|url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/27011/total-element-long-run-incremental-cost-telric|website=Techopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Union of Polish Patriots''' (''Society of Polish Patriots'', {{lang-pl|ZwiƒÖzek Patriot√≥w Polskich}}, ZPP, {{lang-ru|–°–æ—é–∑ –ü–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ü–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–æ—Ç–æ–≤,  –°–ü–ü}}) was a political body created by [[Communism in Poland|Polish communists]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1943. The ZPP, unofficially controlled and directed by Stalin, became one of the founding structures of the Soviet-controlled communist government that eventually took power in the [[Polish People's Republic]].&lt;ref name="Wr√≥ciƒá do Polski"/&gt;

The ZPP was a mass organization with about 100,000 members (Polish citizens in the Soviet Union, mostly war refugees and Soviet deportees left after the departure of [[Anders' Army]]). It was dominated by people from the [[Central Bureau of Polish Communists]], which also operated in the Soviet Union, but included activists of many political orientations.&lt;ref name="Wr√≥ciƒá do Polski"/&gt;
 
In January 1943, [[Wanda Wasilewska]] and Alfred Lampe petitioned the Soviet authorities for creation of an all-encompassing Polish center in the Soviet Union; it would function as a "counterweight for the reactionary (Polish) √©migr√© elements". According to Wasilewska, the name of the organization was Stalin's idea.&lt;ref name="Wr√≥ciƒá do Polski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koper 62‚Äì63"/&gt; The ZPP was organized from 1 March and its significance increased after the Soviet Union broke relations with the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in April 1943, following the discovery of the [[Katyn massacre]].&lt;ref name="Koper 62‚Äì63"/&gt;

In May 1943, the future ZPP activists were involved in the creation of the [[Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Infantry Division]], which gave rise to the [[Polish People's Army]]. It fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] together with the Soviet [[Red Army]]. The Polish People's Army was placed under command of General [[Zygmunt Berling]] and later it merged with [[Armia Ludowa]], the communist underground force in Poland.&lt;ref name="Wr√≥ciƒá do Polski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918‚Äì1945 533‚Äì534"/&gt;

The ZPP was officially established by its founding congress, which deliberated in [[Moscow]] on 9‚Äì10 June 1943. It was placed under the Directorate, which consisted of President Wanda Wasilewska and four members: Stanis≈Çaw Skrzeszewski, [[Stefan Jƒôdrychowski]], [[W≈Çodzimierz Sokorski]], and Zygmunt Berling.&lt;ref name="Wr√≥ciƒá do Polski"/&gt; Non-communist members of the Main Council included [[Andrzej Witos]] and [[Boles≈Çaw Drobner]].&lt;ref name="Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918‚Äì1945 533‚Äì534"/&gt; The ZPP issued a declaration condemning the Polish government-in-exile led by [[W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski]],&lt;ref name="Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918‚Äì1945 533‚Äì534"/&gt; as a body whose actions were damaging the "Anglo-Russo-American bloc".

The program of the ZPP, proclaimed at its congress, stressed the importance of alliance with the Soviet Union and postulated the creation of a democratic and socially just Poland. A new [[Agrarian reform|agrarian]] system was promised. The material, cultural and educational needs of Poles in the Soviet Union were to be satisfied. The ZPP relinquished the Polish claims to the disputed eastern borderlands ([[Kresy]]) as consisting of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Belarus]]ian and [[Lithuania]]n territories, thus denouncing the borders implemented at the [[Peace of Riga]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="Wr√≥ciƒá do Polski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918‚Äì1945 533‚Äì534"/&gt;

The ZPP published its own weekly ''Wolna Polska'' ('The Free Poland'), edited from 1 March 1943 by Wasilewska, and the biweekly ''[[Nowe Widnokrƒôgi]]'' ('New Horizons'), founded by her still earlier.&lt;ref name="Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918‚Äì1945 676‚Äì677"/&gt; The organization provided extensive social and social welfare services and conducted educational activities for the Polish population in the Soviet Union, with children receiving particular attention (an estimated half of the children of Polish deportees went to Polish schools).&lt;ref name="Wr√≥ciƒá do Polski"/&gt; The ZPP's Social Welfare Department took over the Polish welfare activities previously conducted in the Soviet Union by the [[Government Delegation for Poland]] of the Polish government-in-exile, and to reach the widely dispersed Polish population it worked together with a Soviet agency set up for the same purpose.&lt;ref name="Kochanski 376"/&gt; About 55,000 Poles were relocated from northern [[Siberia]] to the European regions of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1943, 223,000 Polish citizens were under the care of the ZPP.&lt;ref name="Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918‚Äì1945 533‚Äì534"/&gt; In late 1943, the ZPP established the Polish National Committee (''Polski Komitet Narodowy'', PKN) with the intention of turning it into a communist-dominated provisional government of Poland.&lt;ref name="Kochanski 372"/&gt;

In 1944 the ZPP formally recognized the [[State National Council]] (''Krajowa Rada Narodowa'', KRN) established in [[Warsaw]] by the ZPP's rival communist institution, the [[Polish Workers' Party]] (PPR). Together with the PPR and the Soviets, the ZPP was responsible for the formation in July 1944 of the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (''Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego'', PKWN), a nascent communist government.&lt;ref name="Wr√≥ciƒá do Polski"/&gt;

In 1945‚Äì1946 the ZPP was involved in [[Polish population transfers (1944‚Äì1946)|resettling Poles]] from the Soviet Union into Poland.&lt;ref name="Wr√≥ciƒá do Polski"/&gt;

On 30 July 1946, the State National Council dissolved the Union of Polish Patriots.&lt;ref name="Wr√≥ciƒá do Polski"/&gt;

'''Victimisation''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|or]] '''victimization''') is the process of being victimised or becoming a [[wikt:victim|victim]]. The field that studies the process, rates, incidence, effects, and prevalence of victimisation is called [[victimology]].

==Peer victimisation==
{{Main|Peer victimisation}}
Peer victimisation is the experience among children of being a target of the [[aggressive]] behaviour of other children, who are not siblings and not necessarily age-mates.&lt;ref name=twenty&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hawker D.S.J. |author2=Boulton M.J. | year = 2000 | title = Twenty years' research on peer victimisation and psychosocial maladjustment: a meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 441‚Äì455 | doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary Victimization==
===Prevalence===
Secondary victimization (also known as post crime victimization &lt;ref&gt; "post-crime victimization or secondary victimization". Comprehensive Criminal Justice Terminology. Prentice Hall. Archived from the original on 10 March 2013. Retrieved 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  or double victimization &lt;ref&gt;Doerner, William (2012). Victimology. Burlington, MA: Elseiver, Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-4377-3486-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to further victim-blaming from criminal justice authorities following a report of an original victimization. &lt;ref&gt; "post-crime victimization or secondary victimization". Comprehensive Criminal Justice Terminology. Prentice Hall. Archived from the original on 10 March 2013. Retrieved 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of victimization are high, with an estimated 5.7 million individuals experiencing at least one victimization in 2016. &lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Justice Statistics. (2016). Criminal victimization. U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering these are cases of criminal offenses, the reported rates of violent victimization are disproportionately low. Less than half (42%) report any violent crime of threatened or real force, such as physical assault, battery, or weapons offenses. Additionally, under a quarter (23%) report rape, childhood, or sexual assault to the police. Further, out of the portion that does report sexual assault or rape, about half describe the experience as upsetting, frustrating, and useless.&lt;ref&gt;Filipas, H. &amp; Ullman, S.E. (2001). Social reactions to sexual assault victims from various support groups. Violence and Victims, 6, 673-92. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Monroe, L.M., Kinney, L.M., Weist, M.D. (2005). The experience of sexual assault: Findings from a statewide victim needs assessment. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 20, 767-776.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts to increase criminal reports of victimization, authorities and law enforcement personnel often discount individuals‚Äô violent experiences and fail to attend to both the necessary legal actions and interpersonal actions. &lt;ref&gt;Orth, U. (2002). Secondary victimization of crime victims by criminal proceedings. Social Justice Research, 15, 313-325. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerability===
When institutions or criminal justice system personnel fail to support the victimized individual, victims are vulnerable to secondary victimization. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (1999). Secondary victimization of rape victims: Insights from mental health professionals who treat survivors of violence. Violence and Victims, 14, 261-275.&lt;/ref&gt; While the appropriate and legal way to respond to primary victimization is to report the event, authorities often deny, do not believe, or blame the victim (Campbell &amp; Raja, 1999; Campbell &amp; Raja, 2005). In turn, up to 90% of victims report experiencing negative social reaction and attribute the incident as a ‚Äúsecond rape‚Äù or ‚Äúsecond assault‚Äù &lt;ref&gt;Filipas, H. &amp; Ullman, S.E. (2001). Social reactions to sexual assault victims from various support groups. Violence and Victims, 6, 673-92. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

Research suggests that victim of sexual violence or assault are the least likely to receive support or resources following reporting. &lt;ref&gt;Filipas, H. &amp; Ullman, S.E. (2001). Social reactions to sexual assault victims from various support groups. Violence and Victims, 6, 673-92. &lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to perceived lack of evidence, social stigma, and overall discomfort when dealing with sexual incidences. In a study of rape victims undergoing prosecution for their assault, those who felt their detectives responded empathetically and with understanding were likelier to pursue prosecution, felt their experiences were important, and their cases deserved to be heard. &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, D. (2010). The linkage between secondary victimization by law enforcement and rape case outcomes. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 26, 328-347.&lt;/ref&gt; Empathetic and supportive responses from authorities could potentially improve mental and physical health in rape survivors and additionally, improve reporting rates and lessen judgmental attitudes from the criminal justice system. Because sexual violence is a sensitive subject for all parties, criminal justice personnel may avoid, ignore, or publicly misconstrue their opinions about the situation as an effort to separate themselves or cope with dangerous and uncomfortable situations. Studies suggest these misconceptions by the system may further damage individuals‚Äô mental health and a safer world. &lt;ref&gt;Mendonca, R.D., Gouveia-Pereira, M., &amp; Miranda, M. (2016). Belief in a just world and secondary victimization: The role of adolescent deviant behavior. Personality and Individual Differences, 97, 82-87. &lt;/ref&gt; This could be combatted with accepting, non-accusatory perspectives, aiding in accuracy the sexual violence reports. Several authors speculate authorities‚Äô supportive approach benefits the victim and promotes a just world. &lt;ref&gt;Mendonca, R.D., Gouveia-Pereira, M., &amp; Miranda, M. (2016). Belief in a just world and secondary victimization: The role of adolescent deviant behavior. Personality and Individual Differences, 97, 82-87. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Stromwall, L.A., Alfredsson, H., &amp; Landstrom, S. (2013). Blame attributions and rape: Effects of belief in a just world and relationship level. Legal and Criminological Psychology, 18, 254-261. &lt;/ref&gt; In this way, previous victims might report and seek appropriate resources in the future.

Those exposed to traumatic victimization are vulnerable to experiencing secondary victimization. If social needs such as empathy, support, and understanding are not met, individuals are prone to this phenomenon. While anybody who has experienced victimization is susceptible to secondary victimization, prevalence rates are significantly elevated for some populations. This includes females, children, racial and sexual minorities, and those sexually assaulted by an acquaintance or stranger.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, M.A., Valentine, S.E., Woodward, E.N., &amp; Pantalone, D.W. (2017). Secondary victimization of sexual minority men following disclosure of sexual assault: ‚ÄòVictimizing me all over again‚Ä¶‚Äô. Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy, 14, 275-288. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, those experiencing a certain type of violence are at increased likelihood to experience secondary victimization. These include physical assault, sexual assault, and domestic violence &lt;ref&gt;Laing, L. (2017). Secondary victimization: Domestic violence survivors navigating the family law system. Violence Against Women, 23, 1314-1335. &lt;/ref&gt; Notably, rape victims are at highest risk of secondary victimization from the criminal justice system, with about half who report describing the process as distressing. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (1999). Secondary victimization of rape victims: Insights from mental health professionals who treat survivors of violence. Violence and Victims, 14, 261-275.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ullman, S. E. (2010). Psychology of women (APA Division 35). Talking about sexual assault: Society's response to survivors. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12083-000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reporting Victimization===
As a consequence of social rejections and insensitivities to acknowledging trauma or violence, individuals are increasingly apt to continue not reporting. &lt;ref&gt;Orth, U. (2002). Secondary victimization of crime victims by criminal proceedings. Social Justice Research, 15, 313-325. &lt;/ref&gt; This can be detrimental to victims‚Äô mental health, as sexual violence often happens more than once and not reporting violence helps to maintain a repeated cycle of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, E.R., Menon, S.V., Bystrynski, J., &amp; Allen, N.E. (2017). Sexual assault victimization and pathology: A review and meta-analysis. Clinical Psychology Review, 56, 65-81. doi: 10.1016/j.cpr.2017.06.002&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing violence is associated with negative mental and physical outcomes, including shame, emotion dysregulation, psychological stress, loss of resources, and mental health pathology. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Dworkin, E., &amp; Cabral, G. (2009). An ecological model of the impact of sexual assault on women‚Äôs mental health. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse, 10, 225-246. &lt;/ref&gt; In a meta-analysis about sexual assault victimization and psychopathology, there was a medium-sized effect overall effect size was moderate after accounting for several mental health diagnoses including depression, anxiety, suicidality, disordered eating, and substance abuse. &lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, E.R., Menon, S.V., Bystrynski, J., &amp; Allen, N.E. (2017). Sexual assault victimization and pathology: A review and meta-analysis. Clinical Psychology Review, 56, 65-81. doi: 10.1016/j.cpr.2017.06.002&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that sexual assault victimization is significantly related to mental health distress even after controlling for other associated symptoms. Additionally, women who experience secondary victimization are likelier to have both adverse physical health and mental health implications and are also unlikely to seek services and treatment. &lt;ref&gt;Monroe, L.M., Kinney, L.M., Weist, M.D. (2005). The experience of sexual assault: Findings from a statewide victim needs assessment. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 20, 767-776.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; Given these individuals are likely in a troubled state, pressures of reporting are cognitively taxing. To report crime, especially sexual crimes, implicates a further level of vulnerability. When victims are met with hostile reactions, they are reinforced to not report. This is not only harmful to the individual, but to society, in that perpetrators are thus permitted to continue committing crimes and abuse. As a consequence of victim-blaming and other negative attitudes towards victims, reported rates of criminal abuse are low and distress in victims is high. &lt;ref&gt;Orth, U. (2002). Secondary victimization of crime victims by criminal proceedings. Social Justice Research, 15, 313-325. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactions with Criminal Justice System===
Despite high rates of secondary victimization, reporting rates are low. It is not unusual for criminal justice personnel to discourage victims from prosecuting their sexual assault cases due to victim-blaming behaviors and discounting victims‚Äô traumatic experiences. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Wasco, S.M., Ahrens, C.E., Sefl, T., &amp; Barnes, H.E. (2001). Preventing the ‚ÄúSecond Rape‚Äù: Rape survivors‚Äô experiences with community service providers. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 12, 1239-1259. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ullman, S. E. (2010). Psychology of women (APA Division 35). Talking about sexual assault: Society's response to survivors. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. 
http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12083-000&lt;/ref&gt; One incident that attracts much controversy in the criminal justice system is reporting violent crimes on one‚Äôs intimate partner. Women who report rape by an intimate partner are seen as less credible by the system and law enforcement are more likely to encourage dropping the case. &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, D. (2010). The linkage between secondary victimization by law enforcement and rape case outcomes. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 26, 328-347.&lt;/ref&gt; Societal standards of obeying an intimate partner and thus encompassing rape culture are prevalent in the criminal justice system. &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, D. (2010). The linkage between secondary victimization by law enforcement and rape case outcomes. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 26, 328-347.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is a legal crime that is being reported, victims are often turned away feeling alienated, hopeless, and unworthy and have limited options for resources beyond the system. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Dworkin, E., &amp; Cabral, G. (2009). An ecological model of the impact of sexual assault on women‚Äôs mental health. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse, 10, 225-246. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Fragmented Memory===
A possible explanation of why the criminal justice system is unlikely to believe many victims is due to victims‚Äô fragmented memory. It is not uncommon for victims of sexual abuse to also have a traumatic brain injury or other neurobiological reactions due to assault. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. (2012). The neurobiology of sexual assault: Implications for first responders in law enforcement, prosecution, and victim advocacy. NIJ Research for the Real World Seminar. Retrieved from http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-campbell/Pages/welcome.aspx. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Dworkin, E., &amp; Cabral, G. (2009). An ecological model of the impact of sexual assault on women‚Äôs mental health. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse, 10, 225-246. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; In her work, Campbell explains how molecular changes occur in response to trauma, and how this can influence discrepancies in victims‚Äô reports and recollections of the event. After a traumatic incident, chemical alterations in the brain change, impacting encoding and processing the memory &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. (2012). The neurobiology of sexual assault: Implications for first responders in law enforcement, prosecution, and victim advocacy. NIJ Research for the Real World Seminar. Retrieved from http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-campbell/Pages/welcome.aspx. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Not only do neurobiological changes affect victims‚Äô memories, but emotion dysregulation, repression, suppression, dissociation, and avoidance of the event are also common reactions in victims &lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, E., Clark, D.M., &amp; Ehlers, A. (2001). A prospective investigation of the role of cognitive factors in persistent Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after physical or sexual assault. Behavior Research and Therapy, 39, 1063-1084. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ehlers, A., &amp; Clark, D. M. (2000). A cognitive model of posttraumatic stress disorder. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 38, 319‚Äì345. doi:10.1016/s0005-7967(99)00123-0&lt;/ref&gt; These cognitive and neurobiological factors are rarely considered when a victim reports an assault. &lt;ref&gt;Venema, R.M. (2016). Police officer schema of sexual assault reports. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 31, 872-899. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. (2012). The neurobiology of sexual assault: Implications for first responders in law enforcement, prosecution, and victim advocacy. NIJ Research for the Real World Seminar. Retrieved from http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-campbell/Pages/welcome.aspx. &lt;/ref&gt;. During the time law enforcement personnel gather information about the event, they could be met with victims explaining their stories inconsistently due to a fragmented memory. Either by a neurobiological change or psychological response to particularly distressing trauma, victims may fall prey to the inability to coherently portray details of the event, thus taking away credibility and facilitating secondary victimization. &lt;ref&gt;Ullman, S. E. (2010). Psychology of women (APA Division 35). Talking about sexual assault: Society's response to survivors. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association.

The term '''revictimisation''' refers to a pattern wherein the victim of abuse and/or crime has a statistically higher tendency to be victimised again, either shortly thereafter&lt;ref name="Finkelhor-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Finkelhor | first1 = D. | last2 = Ormrod | first2 = RK. | last3 = Turner | first3 = HA. | title = Re-victimization patterns in a national longitudinal sample of children and youth | journal = Child Abuse Negl | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 479‚Äì502 |date=May 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.chiabu.2006.03.012 | pmid = 17537508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or much later in adulthood in the case of abuse as a child.  This latter pattern is particularly notable in cases of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=rad&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual Assault Revictimization |journal=Research &amp; Advocacy Digest |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=May 2004 |pages=1 |first=Janet|last=Anderson|publisher=The Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=messman&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0272-7358(96)00019-0|title=Child Sexual Abuse and its Relationship to Revictimization in Adult Women|author1=Messman Terri L. |author2=Long Patricia J. |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=397‚Äì420|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While an exact percentage is almost impossible to obtain, samples from many studies suggest the rate of revictimisation for people with histories of sexual abuse is very high.  The vulnerability to victimisation experienced as an adult is also not limited to sexual assault, and may include [[Domestic violence|physical abuse]] as well.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Reasons as to why revictimisation occurs vary by event type, and some mechanisms are unknown.  Revictimisation in the short term is often the result of risk factors that were already present, which were not changed or mitigated after the first victimisation; sometimes the victim cannot control these factors.  Examples of these risk factors include living or working in dangerous areas, chaotic familial relations, having an aggressive temperament, drug or alcohol usage and unemployment.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Revictimisation of adults who were previously sexually abused as children is more complex.  Multiple theories exist as to how this functions.  Some scientists propose a maladaptive form of [[Learning theory (education)|learning]]; the initial abuse teaches inappropriate beliefs and behaviours that persist into adulthood.  The victim believes that abusive behaviour is "normal" and comes to expect, or feel they deserve, it from others in the context of relationships, and thus may unconsciously seek out abusive partners or cling to abusive relationships.  Another theory draws on the principle of [[learned helplessness]].  As children, they are put in situations that they have little to no hope of escaping, especially when the abuse comes from a caregiver.&lt;ref name=messman/&gt;  One theory goes that this state of being unable to [[Fight-or-flight response|fight back or flee]] the danger leaves the last primitive option:  freeze, an offshoot of [[Apparent death|death-feigning]].

== Offenders choosing pre-traumatized victims ==

In adulthood, the freeze response can remain, and some professionals have noted that victimisers sometimes seem to pick up subtle clues of this when choosing a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wheeler S. |author2=Book A.S. |author3=Costello K. | year = 2009 | title = Psychopathic traits and perceptions of victim vulnerability | url = | journal = Criminal Justice and Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 635‚Äì648 | doi=10.1177/0093854809333958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour can make the victim an easier target, as they sometimes make less effort to fight back or vocalise. Afterwards, they often [[make excuses]] and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimise]] what happened to them, sometimes never reporting the assault to the authorities.

==Self-victimisation==
{{Main|Victim playing}}
Self-victimisation (or victim playing) is the fabrication of victimhood for a variety of reasons such to justify abuse of others, to manipulate others, a [[coping strategy]] or [[attention seeking]].

==Self-image of victimisation (victim mentality)==
{{Main|Victim mentality}}
Victims of [[abuse]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] often get trapped into a [[self-image]] of victimisation. The psychological profile of victimisation includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, [[pessimism]], negative thinking, strong feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rates of victimisation in United States==
Levels of criminal activity are measured through three major data sources: the [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR), self-report surveys of criminal offenders, and the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS). However, the UCR and self-report surveys generally report details regarding the offender and the criminal offense; information on the victim is only included so far as his/her relationship to the offender, and perhaps a superficial overview of his/her injuries. The NCVS is a tool used to measure the existence of actual, rather than only those reported, crimes‚Äîthe victimisation rate&lt;ref name="NCVS"&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict.htm National Crime Victimization Survey Official web site]&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîby asking individuals about incidents in which they may have been victimised. The National Crime Victimization Survey is the [[United States]]' primary source of information on crime victimisation.

Each year, data is obtained from a nationally represented sample of 77,200 households comprising nearly 134,000 persons on the frequency, characteristics and consequences of criminal victimisation in the United States.  This survey enables the (government) to estimate the likelihood of victimisation by [[Rape]] (more valid estimates were calculated after the surveys redesign in 1992 that better tapped instances of sexual assault, particularly of [[Date rape]]),&lt;ref name=Doerner&gt;{{cite book|last=Doerner|first=William|title=Victimology|year=2012|publisher=Elseiver, Inc.|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=978-1-4377-3486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[robbery]], [[assault]], [[theft]], household burglary, and motor vehicle theft for the population as a whole as well as for segments of the population such as women, the elderly, members of various racial groups, city dwellers, or other groups.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt; According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] (BJS), the NCVS reveals that, from 1994 to 2005, violent crime rates have declined, reaching the lowest levels ever recorded.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt; Property crimes continue to decline.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt;

In 2010, the [[National Institute of Justice]] reported that American adolescents were the age group most likely to be victims of violent crime, while American men were more likely than American women to be victims of violent crime, and blacks were more likely than Americans of other races to be victims of violent crime.&lt;ref name="NIJ2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/victims-victimization/welcome.htm | title=Victims and Victimization | date=20 September 2010 | accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In employment law==
Victimisation is a concept in [[employment law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= This section provides general information on employment law in the UK|publisher=UK Film Council|year=2009|url= http://www.diversitytoolkit.org.uk/workinginfilm/employmentlaw/discriminationlaw/harassment/|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the [[Socialist state|socialist states]] of Central and Eastern Europe.

Instead, the conflict was fought on an ideological basis and in [[proxy war]]s. Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact led to the expansion of military forces and their integration into the respective blocs.&lt;ref name=Reinalda2009 /&gt; Its largest military engagement was the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968 (with the participation of all Pact nations except [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[East Germany]]),&lt;ref name=Yoder1993 /&gt; which, in part, resulted in Albania withdrawing from the pact less than a month later. The Pact began to unravel in its entirety with the spread of the [[Revolutions of 1989]] through the [[Eastern Bloc]], beginning with the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,159069,00.html] Cover Story: The Holy Alliance By Carl Bernstein Sunday, June 24, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[Polish legislative election, 1989|electoral success]] in June 1989.

[[East Germany]] withdrew from the Pact following reunification with [[West Germany]] in 1990. On 25 February 1991, the Pact was declared at an end at a meeting of defence and foreign ministers from the six remaining member states in [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]. The USSR itself was [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved in December 1991]], although most of the former Soviet republics formed the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]] shortly thereafter. Throughout the following 20 years, the seven Warsaw Pact countries outside the USSR each joined NATO (East Germany through its reunification with West Germany; and the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] as separate countries), as did the three [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]) that had been part of the Soviet Union.

==Structure==
The Warsaw Treaty's organization was two-fold: the Political Consultative Committee handled political matters, and the Combined Command of Pact Armed Forces controlled the assigned multi-national forces, with headquarters in [[Warsaw]], Poland. Furthermore, the [[Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization]] which commanded and controlled all the military forces of the member countries was also a First Deputy [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defence of the USSR]], and the [[Chief of Combined Staff of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization]] was also a First Deputy [[Chief of the General Staff (Russia)#Chiefs of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces (1946‚Äì1991)|Chief of the General Staff]] of the [[Soviet Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] of the USSR. Therefore, although ostensibly an international [[collective security]] alliance, the USSR dominated the Warsaw Treaty armed forces.&lt;ref name="The Soviet Army in the Cold War Years (1945‚Äì1991)"/&gt;

==Strategy==
The strategy behind the formation of the Warsaw Pact was driven by the desire of the [[Soviet Union]] to dominate Central and [[Eastern Europe]]. The Soviets wanted to keep their part of Europe and not let the Americans take it from them. This policy was driven by ideological and geostrategic reasons. Ideologically, the [[Soviet Union]] arrogated the right to define socialism and communism and act as the leader of the global socialist movement. A corollary to this idea was the necessity of intervention if a country appeared to be violating core socialist ideas and Communist Party functions, which was explicitly stated in the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]].&lt;ref name="The Brezhnev Doctrine and Communist Ideology"/&gt; Geostrategic principles also drove the Soviet Union with the desire to create a buffer zone to prevent invasion of its territory by [[Western Europe]]an powers.

[[File:Warszawa Pa≈Çac Prezydencki 2011.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace]] in [[Warsaw]], Poland, where the Warsaw Pact was established and signed on 14 May 1955]]
Before the creation of the Warsaw Pact, Czechoslovak leadership, fearful of a rearmed [[Germany]], sought to create a security pact with East Germany and Poland.&lt;ref name="Laurien Crump Routledge page 21-22"/&gt; These states protested strongly against the re-militarization of [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Europa Antoni Czubi≈Ñski Wydawn. Pozna≈Ñskie, 1998, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; The Warsaw Pact was primarily put in place as a consequence of the rearming of [[West Germany]] inside [[NATO]]. Soviet leaders, like many European countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain, feared Germany being once again a military power and a direct threat. The terrible consequences of German militarism remained a fresh memory among the Soviets and Eastern Europeans.&lt;ref name="History Channel 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History Channel 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Politics: The Menu for Choice page 87

Previously, in March 1954, the USSR, fearing the restoration of German militarism in West Germany, requested admission to NATO.&lt;ref name="soviet request nato"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"1954: Soviet Union suggests it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe. [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] reject this".

The Soviet request to join NATO arose in the aftermath of the [[Berlin Conference (1954)|Berlin Conference]] of January‚ÄìFebruary 1954. Soviet foreign minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] made proposals to have [[German reunification|Germany reunified]]{{sfn|Molotov|1954a|pp=197,201}} and elections for a pan-German government,{{sfn|Molotov|1954a|p=202}} under conditions of withdrawal of the [[Allied Control Council|four powers]]' armies and German neutrality,{{sfn|Molotov|1954a|pp=197‚Äì198, 203, 212}} but all were refused by the other foreign ministers, [[John Foster Dulles|Dulles]] (USA), [[Anthony Eden|Eden]] (UK) and [[Georges Bidault|Bidault]] (France).{{sfn|Molotov|1954a|pp=211‚Äì212, 216}} Proposals for the reunification of Germany were nothing new: earlier on 20 March 1952, talks about a German reunification, initiated by the so-called '[[Stalin Note]]', ended after the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and the United States insisted that a unified Germany should not be neutral and should be free to join the [[European Defence Community]] and rearm. [[James Clement Dunn|James Dunn]] (USA), who met in [[Paris]] with Eden, Adenauer and [[Robert Schuman]] (France), affirmed that "the object should be to avoid discussion with the Russians and to press on the European Defense Community".&lt;ref name="Steininger1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steininger |first=Rolf |date=1991 |title=The German Question: The Stalin Note of 1952 and the Problem of Reunification |url= |location= |publisher=Columbia Univ Press |page=56 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[John Lewis Gaddis|John Gaddis]] "there was little inclination in Western capitals to explore this offer" from USSR.&lt;ref name="Gaddis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaddis |first=John |date=1997 |title=We Know Now: Rethinking Cold War History |url= |location= |publisher=Clarendon Press |page=126 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While historian [[Rolf Steininger]] asserts that Adenauer's conviction that "neutralization means sovietization" was the main factor in the rejection of the [[Stalin Note|Soviet proposals]],&lt;ref name="Steininger2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steininger |first=Rolf |date=1991 |title=The German Question: The Stalin Note of 1952 and the Problem of Reunification |url= |location= |publisher=Columbia Univ Press |page=80 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adenauer also feared that German unification might have resulted in the end of the CDU's dominance in the West German Bundestag.&lt;ref name="Steininger3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steininger |first=Rolf |date=1991 |title=The German Question: The Stalin Note of 1952 and the Problem of Reunification |url= |location= |publisher=Columbia Univ Press |page=103 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Military power of NATO and the Warsaw Pact states in 1973.svg|thumb|left|NATO (blue) against the Warsaw Pact (red) combined forces in 1973 during the [[Cold War]]]]

Consequently, Molotov, fearing that the EDC would be directed in the future against the USSR and "seeking to prevent the formation of groups of European States directed against other European States",&lt;ref name="molotov proposal europe"/&gt; made a proposal for a General European Treaty on Collective Security in Europe "open to all European States without regard as to their social systems"&lt;ref name="molotov proposal europe"/&gt; which would have included the unified Germany (thus making the [[European Defence Community|EDC]] ‚Äì perceived by the USSR as a threat ‚Äì unusable). But Eden, Dulles and Bidault opposed the proposal.{{sfn|Molotov|1954a|p=214}}

One month later, the proposed European Treaty was rejected not only by supporters of the [[European Defence Community|EDC]] but also by Western opponents of the European Defence Community (like French [[Gaullist]] leader Palewski) who perceived it as "unacceptable in its present form because it excludes the USA from participation in the collective security system in Europe".&lt;ref name="molotov proposal nato"/&gt; The Soviets then decided to make a new proposal to the governments of the USA, UK and France to accept the participation of the USA in the proposed General European Agreement.&lt;ref name="molotov proposal nato"/&gt; And considering that another argument deployed against the Soviet proposal was that it was perceived by Western powers as "directed against the North Atlantic Pact and its liquidation",&lt;ref name="molotov proposal nato"/&gt;{{sfn|Molotov|1954a|p=216,}} the Soviets decided to declare their "readiness to examine jointly with other interested parties the question of the participation of the USSR in the North Atlantic bloc", specifying that "the admittance of the USA into the General European Agreement should not be conditional on the three Western powers agreeing to the USSR joining the North Atlantic Pact".&lt;ref name="molotov proposal nato"/&gt;

Again all proposals, including the request to join NATO, were rejected by the UK, US and French governments shortly after.&lt;ref name="soviet request nato frus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soviet request nato reply"/&gt; Emblematic was the position of British General [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|Hastings Ismay]], a fierce supporter of NATO expansion. He opposed the request to join NATO made by the USSR in 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/17/russia.iantraynor|title=Soviets tried to join Nato in 1954|author=Ian Traynor|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "the Soviet request to join NATO is like an unrepentant burglar requesting to join the police force"&lt;!-- punctuation in original --&gt;.&lt;ref name="soviet request nato note"/&gt;

In April 1954 [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] made his first visit to the USA meeting [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] and [[John Foster Dulles|Dulles]]. Ratification of [[European Defence Community|EDC]] was delaying but the US representatives made it clear to Adenauer that EDC would have to become a part of [[NATO]].{{sfn|Adenauer|1966a|p=662}}

Memories of the Nazi occupation were still strong, and the rearmament of Germany was feared by France too.&lt;ref name="History Channel 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-warsaw-pact-is-formed|title=The Warsaw Pact is formed|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EDC refusal"/&gt; On 30 August 1954 French Parliament rejected the EDC, thus ensuring its failure&lt;ref name="EDC failure"/&gt; and blocking a major objective of US policy towards Europe: to associate Germany militarily with the West.&lt;ref name="Alternatives to EDC"/&gt; The US Department of State started to elaborate alternatives: Germany would be invited to join NATO or, in the case of French obstructionism, strategies to circumvent a French veto would be implemented in order to obtain a German rearmament outside NATO.&lt;ref name="german rearmament"/&gt;

[[File:UAZ-469 (4713547953).jpg|thumb|left|A typical Soviet military jeep [[UAZ-469]], used by most countries of the Warsaw Pact]]

On [[London and Paris Conferences|23 October 1954]] ‚Äì only nine years after Allies (UK, USA and USSR) defeated [[Nazi Germany]] ending [[World War II]] in Europe ‚Äì the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany to the North Atlantic Pact was finally decided. The incorporation of [[West Germany]] into the organization on 9 May 1955 was described as "a decisive turning point in the history of our continent" by [[Halvard Lange]], [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/9/newsid_2519000/2519979.stm|title=West Germany accepted into Nato|work=BBC News|date=9 May 1955|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November  1954, the USSR requested a new European Security Treaty,&lt;ref&gt;"Indivisible Germany: Illusion or Reality?" James H. Wolfe
Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 06.12.2012 page 73&lt;/ref&gt; in order to make a final attempt to not have a remilitarized West Germany potentially opposed to the Soviet Union, with no success.

On 14 May 1955, the USSR and other seven European countries "reaffirming their desire for the establishment of a system of European collective security based on the participation of all European states irrespective of their social and political systems"&lt;ref name="warsaw treaty text"/&gt; established the Warsaw Pact in response to the integration of the Federal Republic of Germany into [[NATO]],&lt;ref name="History Channel 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/formation-of-nato-and-warsaw-pact|title=Formation of Nato and  Warsaw Pact|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATO short history" /&gt; declaring that: "a remilitarized Western Germany and the integration of the latter in the North-Atlantic bloc [...] increase the danger of another war and constitutes a threat to the national security of the peaceable states; [...] in these circumstances the peaceable European states must take the necessary measures to safeguard their security".&lt;ref name="warsaw treaty text"/&gt;

One of the founding members, [[East Germany]] was allowed to re-arm by the Soviet Union and the [[National People's Army]] was established as the armed forces of the country to counter the rearmament of [[West Germany]] and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2012/10/13/no-shooting-please-were-german|title=No shooting please, we‚Äôre German|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight member countries of the Warsaw Pact pledged the mutual defence of any member who would be attacked. Relations among the treaty signatories were based upon mutual [[non-interventionism|non-intervention]] in the internal affairs of the member countries, respect for [[national sovereignty]], and political independence. However, almost all governments of those member states were indirectly controlled by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-warsaw-pact-3878466|title=How the Russians Used the Warsaw Pact|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During Cold War===
{{Main|Cold War}}
[[File:Praga 11.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet tanks on the streets of [[Prague]] during the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]], 1968]]
For 36 years, [[NATO]] and the Warsaw Pact never directly waged war against each other in Europe; the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies implemented strategic policies aimed at the containment of each other in Europe, while working and fighting for influence within the wider [[Cold War]] on the international stage. These included the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]], [[Bay of Pigs invasion]], [[Dirty War]], [[Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War]] and the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://militaryhistorynow.com/2013/10/02/the-international-vietnam-war-the-other-world-powers-that-fought-in-south-east-asia/|title=America Wasn‚Äôt the Only Foreign Power in the Vietnam War|date=2 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-worldhistory/chapter/crisis-points-of-the-cold-war/|title=Crisis Points of the Cold War - Boundless World History|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, following the declaration of the [[Imre Nagy]] government of withdrawal of Hungary from the Warsaw Pact, [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet troops entered the country and removed the government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/the-cold-war/the-hungarian-uprising-of-1956/|title=The Hungarian Uprising of 1956 - History Learning Site|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet forces crushed the nationwide revolt, leading to the death of an estimated 2,500 Hungarian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/23/europe/hungarian-revolution-escape/index.html|title=Recalling the Hungarian revolution, 60 years on|first=Matthew Percival,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-national Communist armed forces' sole joint action was the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviets-invade-czechoslovakia|title=Soviets Invade Czechoslovakia - Aug 20, 1968 - HISTORY.com|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All member countries, with the exception of the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] and the People's Republic of Albania, participated in the invasion.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enrs.eu/pl/news/1083-warsaw-pact-invasion-of-czechoslovakia|title=Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|first=Agnieszka|last=Nosowska|website=www.enrs.eu|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German Democratic Republic provided only minimal support, however.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===End of the Cold War===
Beginning at the Cold War's conclusion, in late 1989, [[Revolutions of 1989|popular civil and political public discontent forced the Communist governments of the Warsaw Treaty countries from power]], while independent [[nationalism|national]] politics made feasible with the ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' induced institutional collapse of Communist government in the USSR.&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;

Between 1989 and 1991, Communist governments were overthrown in [[Albania]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]] and the [[Soviet Union]].

As the last acts of the Cold War were playing out, several Warsaw Pact states (Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary) participated in the U.S.-led coalition effort to liberate [[Kuwait]] in the [[Gulf War]].

On 25 February 1991, the Warsaw Pact was declared disbanded at a meeting of defence and foreign ministers from remaining Pact countries meeting in Hungary.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"/&gt; On 1 July 1991, in [[Prague]], the Czechoslovak President [[V√°clav Havel]]&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/02/world/death-knell-rings-for-warsaw-pact.html|title=DEATH KNELL RINGS FOR WARSAW PACT|first=Steven|last=Greenhouse|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; formally ended the 1955 Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance and so disestablished the Warsaw Treaty after 36 years of military alliance with the USSR.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Havel"/&gt; The USSR disestablished itself in December 1991.

==Central and Eastern Europe after the Warsaw Treaty==
[[File:NATO expansion.png|thumb|right|Expansion of [[NATO]] before and after the collapse of communism throughout Central and Eastern Europe]]
On 12 March 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland joined [[NATO]]; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia joined in March 2004; Albania joined on 1 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nato.int/docu/comm/1999/9904-wsh/pres-eng/03acce.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nato.int/docu/update/2004/03-march/e0329a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia and some other post-USSR states joined the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]] (CSTO) in 1992, or the [[Shanghai Five]] in 1996, which was renamed the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO) after [[Uzbekistan]]'s addition in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201805/28/WS5b0b4620a31001b82571c91e.html|title=SCO from the Uzbekistan perspective: Expectations and reality - Opinion - Chinadaily.com.cn|first=|last=ÂÆãËñá|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the Polish government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2074804/heres-how-the-ussr-planned-to-survive-an-all-out-nuclear-war-with-nato-and-march-its-soldiers-into-the-heart-of-a-scorched-europe/|title=Here's how the USSR planned to conquer Europe in an all-out nuclear war|date=29 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened its Warsaw Treaty archives to the [[Institute of National Remembrance]], which published some 1,300 declassified documents in January 2006. Yet the Polish government reserved publication of 100 documents, pending their military declassification. Eventually, 30 of the reserved 100 documents were published; 70 remained secret and unpublished. Among the documents published is the Warsaw Treaty's nuclear war plan, ''[[Seven Days to the River Rhine]]'' ‚Äì a short, swift counter-attack capturing Austria, Denmark, Germany and Netherlands east of River Rhine, using [[nuclear weapon]]s, in self-defence, after a NATO [[first strike]].&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coldwardecoded.blogspot.com/2013/07/nuclear-war-in-west-seven-days-to-river.html|title=DECODED: The Cold War in Europe 1945-1995 : Nuclear War in the West: Seven Days to the River Rhine|first=Redd|last=Catcher|date=11 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan originated as a 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/revealed-how-the-warsaw-pact-planned-win-world-war-three-16822|title=Revealed: How the Warsaw Pact Planned to Win World War Three in Europe|first=Kyle|last=Mizokami|date=2 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; field training exercise war game and metamorphosed into official Warsaw Treaty battle doctrine, until the late 1980s ‚Äì which is why the Polish People's Republic was a nuclear weapons base,&lt;ref&gt;http://eastviewpress.com/Files/SS_FROM%20THE%20ARCHIVES_No.%202_2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; first, to 178, then, to 250 tactical-range rockets, though these numbers may differ.

'''Wexis''' is a humorous [[portmanteau]] used to refer to the alleged [[duopoly]] of [[publishing]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] that dominate the [[United States|U.S.]] legal information services industry ‚Äì namely, [[Thomson West|West Publishing]] and [[LexisNexis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKnight |first=Jean |date=April 1997 |title=Wexis versus the Net |url= |journal=Illinois Bar Journal |publisher= |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=189-190 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Statsky|first1=William P.|title=Introduction to Paralegalism: Perspectives, Problems and Skills|date=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston|isbn=9781285449050|edition=8th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDZTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither of these companies is independent ‚Äì they are parts of much larger conglomerates that dominate the entire information services sector. West is owned by [[Thomson Reuters]], while LexisNexis is a division of [[RELX Group]].

These companies dispute the allegation that they are a duopoly; LexisNexis actually sued one company which used the terms "Wexis" and "duopoly" in its marketing literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Antitrust issues==
The [[United States district court]] imposed various requirements regarding the companies' operations in a consent decree resulting from an [[antitrust]] inquiry by the [[United States Department of Justice]] under the [[Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act]] in connection with Thomson's purchase of West Publishing, and West's and Lexis's settlement of various outstanding claims in that proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f2200/2225.htm Final Judgment: ''U.S. v. The Thomson Corporation and West Publishing Company,'' Civil No.: 96-1415 (PLF), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, March 7, 1997].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, West was required to license the "star pagination" in its printed [[reporter (law)|reporters]] under certain terms.&lt;ref&gt;Final Judgment, Part IX.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, [[lawyer]]s in jurisdictions that require citations to all official and unofficial reporters would have to subscribe to ''both'' online services to get all the necessary page numbers for [[Case citation|citations]] in their briefs. The judge also had concerns about the Thomson and West products ordered to be [[divestment|divested]] through a sale to Lexis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperlaw.com/ustrans2.htm Transcript - Conference before Judge Friedman, February 6, 1996 -- USA v. Thomson, 96 CV 1415, USDC District of Columbia].&lt;/ref&gt; primarily [[statutory law|statutory]] and [[case law]] publications of Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, such as ''United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers Edition'' and ''United States Code Service'',&lt;ref&gt;Final Judgment, Part IV and Exhibit A1.&lt;/ref&gt; but those sales were ultimately approved.

[[File:Westlaw-LexisNexis printers.jpg|thumb|right|275px|During the 1990s and 2000s, almost every law school in the United States had a pair of Westlaw and LexisNexis printers like these, to which students could print research results for free. However, Westlaw discontinued free printing for law students effective June 30, 2013.]]
Both companies are known for their aggressive marketing programs in American [[law school]]s. Law students may print documents for free that are obtained through their respective services. Both companies also have programs through which students may earn points (based on their number of searches) that can be redeemed for free gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Wolters Kluwer]] is the largest company which has attempted to establish a beachhead against the "Wexis" duopoly; it took over offline legal publishers like Aspen Publishing and online legal services like Loislaw (though it later sold the latter in 2015), and owns [[CCH (company)|Commerce Clearing House (CCH)]]. However, Wolters has not yet unified its online and offline legal offerings under a single brand (although it has gathered its existing brands under the umbrella of "Wolters Kluwer Law and Business"). Most importantly, Wolters lacks an automated cross-referencing or citation-checking service that can directly compete against [[Westlaw]]'s KeyCite or [[Shepard's Citations]] from LexisNexis.

The [[Bureau of National Affairs]] is the best known of the remaining independent law publishing companies. Both BNA and CCH have arrangements with Lexis and Westlaw to publish their content though those electronic services, although they also provide their [[subscribers]] web access to certain publications.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
