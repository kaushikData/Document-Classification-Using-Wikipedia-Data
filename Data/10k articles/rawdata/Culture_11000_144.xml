Established in 1905, the '''American Library Institute''' was an organization conceived by [[Melvil Dewey]] to provide for the investigation, study  and discussion of issues within the field of library theory and practice. Its initial membership consisted of former presidents of the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) and other library professionals who had achieved notoriety which had been recognized by their peers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahern|first=M.E.|year=1931|title=A review of the first twenty-five years' activities of the American library institute.|url=|journal=Libraries|volume=36|pages=309–313|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Formation ===
A pioneer in American librarianship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Library History|last=Weigand|first=W.A|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1994|isbn=0-8240-5787-2|location=|pages=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an influential figure in the development of libraries in America in the late 19th and early the 20th century, Melvil Dewey played a major role in the establishment of both the American Library Association and the [[National Association of State Libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hitt|first=J.M.|year=1926|title=A brief history of the National association of state libraries|url=|journal=Bulletin Of The American Library Association|volume=20|pages=584|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, concerned about the size of the ALA, Dewey felt the need to establish a small library league or academy which would undertake the study of librarianship in the form of small meetings and discussions. This scholarly focus, in Dewey's opinion, was no longer practical under the growing membership of the ALA. The mandate of this new institution would be thought leadership and the formation and clarification of opinions relating to library issues. The resulting findings and recommendations were then to be published. The option and responsibility to take any specific actions resulting from these findings, fell to the ALA.

A proposal was presented to the ALA council in late 1904 and a committee of five was appointed to study the formation of the proposed academy. In July 1905, at a conference in Portland, OR, the ALA voted to establish the American Library Institute. While the proposed organization would not be under the formal control of the ALA, a committee was formed consisting of 15 former [[List of presidents of the American Library Association|ALA presidents]] with a mandate to draft a constitution and by-laws and to develop a plan to launch the American Library Institute.

=== Membership ===
* Recognized library leaders and thinkers from English speaking America
* Former presidents of the American Library Association 
* Not to exceed one hundred persons

=== Governing structure ===
* President (Board Chairman) - 2-year term
* Secretary-Treasurer - 2-year term
* Board of five members - 5-year term
* Members of ALA executive board to have seats at council
* Two meetings per year
First board included Melvil Dewey, President; [[Henry James Carr]], Secretary-Treasurer; and [[James Hulme Canfield]], [[Frederick M. Crunden]], [[John Cotton Dana|John C. Dana]].

==== Presidents&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ====
* [[Melvil Dewey]] 1905-08 (ALA President 1890-93)
* [[Arthur Elmore Bostwick|Arthur E. Bostwick]] 1909-11, 1925-27 (ALA President 1907-08)
* [[Frank Pierce Hill|Frank P. Hill]] 1912-15 (ALA President 1905-06)
* [[Ernest Cushing Richardson|Ernest C. Richardson]] 1916-18 (ALA President 1904-05)

* Henry B. Van Hoesen 1934-36
* [[George Burwell Utley|George B. Utley]] 1937-39
* Phineas L. Windsor 1940-

=== Dissolution ===
The committee that initially defined the membership along elitist lines designed an organization that could not maintain its longterm relevancy. Records of later meetings show personal opinion and preference entering into the decision making of the institute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subsequently, by the end of the 1930s, the institute had become not much more than a debating society for retired librarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=L.|year=1973|title=Library co-operation in the United States|url=|journal=International library review|volume=5 |issue=2|pages=139–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the second world war there was little activity within the organization and annual meetings were suspended in 1942. A single meeting was held in 1949 to vote on the issue of dissolution of the institute. The vote was finalized the following year and remaining funds were transferred to the American Library Association in early 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archives.library.illinois.edu/alaarchon/?p=creators/creator&amp;id=3543|title=American Library Institute|last=|first=|date=2011|website=American Library Association Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bandiera Arancione''' (Orange Flag in Italian) is a recognition of quality awarded by the  [[Touring Club Italiano]] to small towns (population 15,000 or less) in [[Italy]] for excellency in tourism, hospitality and the environment.

This recognition was established in 1998 in [[Liguria]], in response to a regional institution's demand to foster and promote the Italian  hinterland. The Touring Club Italiano (TCI) developed an analytical model to identify the first towns recognized with the 'Bandiera Arancione'. Later the recognition was adopted on nationwide scale to identify sites of excellence in all regions of Italy.

This is the only Italian project of its kind to be listed by the [[World Tourism Organization]] among successful programs for the sustainable development of tourism around the world.

== Objectives ==
The main assessment criteria evaluated by the TCI for the award of the ''Bandiera Arancione'' are:
*use of local resources;
*culture of hospitality;
*fostering crafts and local products;
*encouraging local entrepreneurship;
*strengthening territorial identity.

[[File:Symonds Yat Rock View.JPG|thumb|200px|The Forest of Dean, the reported home of Beast of Dean]]
The '''Beast of Dean''' is an animal said to live, or to have once lived, in the [[Forest of Dean]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]].&lt;ref name = reed&gt;Reed, Matthew and Naylor, Rhiannon and Lewis, Nick (2014) Feral big cats in rural Gloucestershire - reflecting on the possible presence of exotic animals in the English landscape.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally thought to resemble a [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), but abnormally large in size. At that time of its first sightings, wild boar were extinct in Britain.&lt;ref name = goulding&gt; Goulding, M. 2001.Possible genetic sources of free‐living Wild Boar (Sus scrofa) in southern England. Mammal Review: 31 &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Farmers from the village of [[Parkend, Gloucestershire|Parkend]] undertook an expedition to capture and kill the creature, in 1802 but found nothing. The animal they were hunting was reported to be a boar large enough to fell trees and hedges.

Beginning in the early 1990's a number of [[Phantom cat]]s were sighted in the Forest of Dean. &lt;ref name = newton&gt; Newton, M. 2005. Encyclopedia of Cryptozoology: a Global Guide. McFarland and Company Incorporated. London. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of these "Black Panthers" was thrown into further confusion in 2002 when a large Wild Boar with black fur was [[roadkill|killed]] in a collision along the [[A40 road (Great Britain)|A40]] near the town of [[Over, Gloucestershire|Over]]&lt;ref name = newton/&gt;.

==In fiction==
In the science-fiction television series ''[[Primeval (TV series)|Primeval]]'', the Beast of Dean turns out to be a [[gorgonops]]id that arrived in the present day through a wormhole leading to the [[Permian]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2010183,00.html|title=Saturday night feast of big, big beasts|last1=Flett|first1=Kathryn|last2=|first2=|date=11 February 2007|website=[[The Observer]]|publisher=|access-date=|quote=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219224609/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0%2C%2C2010183%2C00.html|archivedate=19 February 2007|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bike rage''' refers to acts of verbal or gestural anger or physical aggression between [[cyclists]] and other users of bike paths or roadways, including pedestrians, other cyclists, motorcyclists, or drivers. Bike rage can consist of shouting at other road users, making obscene gestures or threats, hitting or punching, or in rare cases, even more violent acts. The term can refer either to acts committed by cyclists&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008&gt;{{cite web|first=Charles |last=Montogomery |date=July 1, 2008 |title=Bike Rage |work=Momentum |url=http://momentummag.com/features/bike-rage/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220214828/http://momentummag.com/features/bike-rage/ |archivedate=2013-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by drivers.&lt;ref name=Creagh2008&gt;{{cite news |first=Sunanda |last=Creagh |date=August 2, 2008 |title=Sydney's drivers 'worst' for bike rage |work=The Sydney Morning Herald

==Causes==
[[File:Traffic jam Rio de Janeiro 03 2008 28.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Some transportation experts argue that traffic congestion may be a contributing factor to driver frustration and bike rage.]]
A bike rage incident can start because a cyclist, driver, or pedestrian believes that another road user was being discourteous, breaking traffic rules, or in many cases because someone felt that their safety was being compromised by the actions of another road user. According to University of Hawaii professor of psychology Leon James, "bike rage is a common occurrence, and quite predictable", because urban commuting causes "tension, anxiety, and anger – in drivers as well as cyclists".&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt; Montogomery claims some cyclists hit cars using a "classic U-lock bash-and-run" tactic. He argues that "some cyclists consider such attacks acts of driver education". Montogomery claims the "...problem is that city planners have mixed bikes and cars together in ways that offer little certainty about how each should operate, and lots of chances for conflict". As such, "cyclists feel threatened in traffic" and "...hard done by and under attack."&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt;
 
An article in ''Toronto Life'' magazine argues that the "...source of the problem [bike and road rage] is neither the arrogance of drivers nor the militancy of cyclists, but the environment in which they interact." The article claims that the "...urban grid, already congested with cars, is being flooded with cyclists...intensifying competition for road space." One issue is that "[d]rivers are not sufficiently alert to the presence and the quickness of cyclists". A possible explanation for all of the aggression that occurs between cyclists and drivers is the anonymity of the big city: "...they know they will never run into that person again."&lt;ref name="torontolife.com"&gt;All the Rage
The tension between drivers and cyclists has escalated to swearing, punching, bird-flipping hysteria. City hall thinks additional bike lanes will calm everybody down. What if they’re wrong? By Philip Preville. In ''Toronto Life'' magazine. Available at: http://www.torontolife.com/features/all-rage/?pageno=1&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the S.F. Bicycle Coalition argues that "Road rage is a symptom of a contradiction between the image and promise of cars and the reality," because "You never see a car ad showing someone stuck in traffic." After an altercation between cyclists and police, an observer noted that "The sheep -- like the man who was just riding to the gym and decided to join and have a little fun -- were bewildered, angry, defiant. Turned into wolves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/july97/news/news2970730.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307074318/http://www.salon.com/july97/news/news2970730.html |date=March 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 ''New York Times'' article stated that "...overwhelmingly, on blogs and Web sites nationwide, drivers and cyclists routinely describe shouted epithets, flung water bottles, sprays of spit and harrowing near-misses of the intentional kind." The article noted that there is "a whiff of class warfare in the simmering hostility, too. During morning rush, the teeth-gritting of drivers is almost audible, as superbly fit cyclists, wearing Sharpie-toned spandex and riding $3,000 bikes, cockily dart through the swampy, stolid traffic to offices with bike racks and showers."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/fashion/10bikewars.html|title=Moving Targets|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 8, 2008|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bike rage may also be caused by confusion about how the rules of the road apply to cyclists. In some jurisdictions, cyclists are allowed to ride on the sidewalk, whereas in other places, this is against the law. In all fifty U.S. states, bicycles are classified as vehicles and cyclists have many of the same rights and responsibilities as other drivers&lt;ref&gt;https://bikeleague.org/content/traffic-laws&lt;/ref&gt;; however, other jurisdictions may place restrictions on where citizens may operate bicycles. These differences in rules may lead drivers to believe that a cyclist is violating the law by cycling on a roadway, even if local laws require cyclists to be on the road. Many citizens are also ignorant of their localities' laws concerning bicycles.  {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Drivers attacking cyclists===
In Toronto in January 2006, a driver tossed his lunch out the window of his car in a traffic jam. A 26-year-old bike courier threw the food back into the car. The driver tossed two cups of hot coffee at the courier, and then, after they exchanged insults, the driver attacked the woman and her bike.&lt;ref name="torontolife.com" /&gt;

In 2009 in Los Angeles, a 59-year-old man was "charged with two felony counts each of reckless driving causing injury, battery with serious bodily injury and the special allegation of causing great bodily injury". After the man had an argument with two cyclists, he "allegedly stopped short and caused one [bike] rider to go through the rear window of Dr. Thompson's Infiniti and other rider to crash onto the pavement. The driver, who admitted slamming on his brakes, was later sentenced to 10 years in prison."&lt;ref&gt;Brentwood driver charged in bike rage
Kevin Roderick • July 11, 2008. Available at: http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2008/07/brentwood_driver_charged.php&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''New York Times'' story stated a 41-year-old cyclist, Dan Cooley was injured by a driver who became angry at him after an exchange of swear words. The incident began when the driver came out of a driveway in front of Mr. Cooley. Angered, Mr. Cooley cursed at the driver, who responded in kind. As Mr. Cooley moved off the road, the car drove into him, and knocked him to the ground with the vehicle, and then the driver got out of the car and attacked him, leaving him with a concussion and a torn ligament. Mr. Cooley thinks that the anger between cyclists and drivers might be due to the relatively new arrival of bikes on city streets: “We’ve had a [[car culture]] for so long and suddenly the roads become saturated with bicyclists trying to save gas"; however, he added,“No one knows how to share the road.”&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

According to the ''UK Guardian'', a cyclist named Jefferey Guffey from Indiana told a driver to slow down. The driver attacked Guffey and bit part of his ear off. After the incident, police charged the attacker with battery. In Oxford, "police investigated a spate of attacks on cyclists motivated, apparently, by hatred of bicycles and their riders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/5171552.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Oxfordshire &amp;#124; Drivers accused of cycle rage |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Wolmar]], an international expert on transportation, stated that Sydney "drivers are more hostile towards cyclists than motorists of any other country".&lt;ref name=Creagh2008/&gt;

===Cyclists attacking drivers===
In Toronto in 2007, "... after being cut off by a driver just after morning rush hour in Toronto, a cyclist caught up to the car, reached inside the window, and stabbed the driver in the face and neck with a screwdriver."&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt;

A 2004 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' article states that a Pennsylvania bicyclist shot a truck driver in the arm after an altercation. The truck driver, William Nicoletti, 51, drove past the cyclist, who made an obscene gesture. Mr. Nicoletti stated that when he turned his truck around and drove toward the cyclist, man on the bike drew a pistol and shot Mr. Nicoletti. The man on the bicycle, Robert Urick, 41, was "charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons offenses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=February 10, 2004 |title=Bike rage: Cyclist allegedly insults, shoots driver |work=Chicago Sun-Times |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1517999.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 ''Newsweek'' article entitled "Pedal vs. Metal: A surge in bike ridership spurs a new kind of road rage" described an altercation which began after a driver named Patrick Schrepping told cyclist Adam Leckie to wear a helmet. Following this conversation, Leckie "allegedly responded by keying Schrepping's car", and then Schrepping struck Leckie with a metal object. Both men were arrested and charged with assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/149224 |title=Road Rage in Portland: Bikes, Cars Clash |publisher=Newsweek |date=July 27, 2008 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael J. Bryant]] (born April 13, 1966) is a former public administrator and former [[politician]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] who was involved in an incident with a cyclist. After an altercation with a cyclist on August 31, 2009, in which Bryant's car struck a bike courier, Bryant was charged with criminal negligence causing death and [[Causing death by dangerous driving|dangerous driving causing death]]. On May 25, 2010, all charges against Bryant were withdrawn, with prosecutors describing the cyclist as the aggressor in the incident.&lt;ref name="Withdrawn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/charges-against-bryant-in-fatal-crash-withdrawn-1.898818|title=Charges against Bryant in fatal crash withdrawn |last=|first=|accessdate=2014-05-26|newspaper=CBC News | date=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclists attacking cyclists===

Bike rage does not only involve altercations between drivers and cyclists. In some cases, there have been fights between cyclists. In an incident in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], a 51-year-old cyclist suggested to a 28-year-old cyclist that he should get a bike light so that others could see him. After hearing this comment, the younger cyclist felt "extremely insulted" and allegedly tried to force the older man off the road. The 51-year-old was followed to his home, at which point the 28-year-old "clamped his hands around O'Brien's head" and then "... twisted O'Brien to the ground and kicked him in the ribs." Police indicated that they planned to charge the younger man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christians |first=Lindsay |url=http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/317158 |title=Cap Times : Ct |publisher=Madison.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[historical linguistics]], the '''Canaanite shift''' is a [[sound change]] that took place in the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite dialects]], which belong to the [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] branch of the [[Semitic languages]] family. This sound change caused Proto-NW-Semitic *ā (long ''a'') to turn into ''ō'' (long ''o'') in Proto-Canaanite. It accounts, for example, for the difference between the second vowel of [[Hebrew]] [[wikt:שלום|שלום]] (''šalom'', [[Tiberian Hebrew|Tiberian]] ''šālōm'') and its [[Arabic]] cognate [[wikt:سلام|سلام]] (''salām''). The original word was probably *šalām-, with the ''ā'' preserved in Arabic, but transformed into ''ō'' in Hebrew. The change is attested in records from the [[Amarna period]], dating it to the mid-2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTrT-bZyuPcC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=canaanite+shift+date&amp;ei=G14FS5rXJoW2NILEoJEM#v=onepage&amp;q=canaanite%20shift%20date&amp;f=false |title=The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and cause==
This [[vowel shift]] is well attested in Hebrew and other Canaanite languages, but its exact nature is unclear and contested.

===Theory of unconditioned shift===
Many scholars consider this shift to be unconditioned. This position states that there were no conditioning factors such as stress or surrounding consonants which affected whether or not any given [[Proto-Semitic]] ''*ā'' became ''ō'' in Canaanite. Such scholars point to the fact that  [[Proto-Semitic]] ''*ā'' virtually always reflects as ''ō'' in Hebrew.

===Theory of stress conditioning===
Some other scholars point to Hebrew words like שמאלי ''səmālī'' (an adjective meaning "on the left"), in which the original ''*ā'' is thought to be preserved. Since such a preservation would be hard to explain by secondary processes like [[loanwords|borrowing]] or [[analogy]], they often assume that the shift was conditional and took place only in stressed syllables and that later, many words changed their form in [[analogy]] to other words in the same [[inflection|paradigm]]. As a result, the conditional nature of the shift became indistinct.

====Responses to stress conditioning theory====
Those who support a theory of unconditioned shift contend that stress conditioning does not account for the fact that often ''*ā'' became ''ō'' even in positions where it was neither stressed nor part of an inflectional or derivational paradigm, and that such forms as {{Hebrew|שמאלי}} may indeed be a secondary development, since {{Hebrew|שמאל}} ''səmōl'', the unsuffixed basic form of the word, actually does contain an ''o''. The ''a'' of {{Hebrew|שמאלי}}, therefore could be explained as having occurred ''after'' the vowel shift had ceased to be synchronically productive.

A parallel may be found in the pre-classical history of [[Latin]], where a phenomenon called [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]] affected all instances of intervocalic {{IPA|/s/}} turning them into {{IPA|/r/}}. Thus ''rus'' (countryside), for example, took the oblique form ''ruri'' from ''*rusi''. The phenomenon, naturally, failed to affect instances of intervocalic {{IPA|/s/}} formed after it had become productive. Thus ''essus'' was not rhotacized because as a leveling of *ed-tus, it did not have an {{IPA|/s/}} to be transformed at the time of the rhotic phenomenon.

In much the same way the shape of such words as {{Hebrew|שמאלי}} may, in fact, represent a secondary process occurring after the Canaanite shift ceased to be productive.

==Hebrew-Arabic parallels==
The shift was so productive in Canaanite languages that it altered their inflectional and derivational morphologies wherever they contained the reflex of a pre-Canaanite *ā, as can be seen in Hebrew, the most attested of Canaanite languages, by comparing it with Arabic, a well-attested non-Canaanite Semitic language.

In two of the above lexical items (''lō'' and ''rōš'') one will notice that the shift did not only affect original long vowels, but also original short vowels occurring in the vicinity of a [[Aleph|historically attested glottal stop]] in Canaanite.

The [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]] pronunciation of ''[[niqqud|qamaṣ gadōl]]'' as {{IPA|[ɔ]}} instead of {{IPA|[aː]}} (as found in other dialects) is regarded by [[Abraham Zevi Idelsohn]] as a further extension of the Canaanite shift (on his theory, the Ashkenazic dialect is derived from that of Galilee in the early centuries CE).  A similar shift is observable in the coastal dialects of [[Syrian Arabic]] (see [[Levantine Arabic]]).

==Uses of the shift==
Often when new source material in an old Semitic language is uncovered, the Canaanite shift may be used to date the source material or to establish that the source material is written in a specifically Canaanite language. The shift is especially useful since it affects long vowels whose presence is likely to be recorded by [[matres lectionis]] such as [[aleph]] and [[Waw/Vav (letter)|waw]], even in a defective consonantal script. In languages where the shift occurs, it also gives historical linguists reason to suppose that other shifts may have taken place.

'''''Complicity''''' is a [[novel]] by Scottish author [[Iain Banks]]. It was published in 1993.

==Plot introduction==
Its two main characters are Cameron Colley, a [[journalist]] on a Scottish newspaper called ''The Caledonian'', which resembles ''[[The Scotsman]]'', and a serial murderer whose identity is a mystery. The passages dealing with the journalist are written in the [[First-person narrative|first person]], and those dealing with the murderer in the [[Second-person narrative|second person]], so the novel presents, in alternate chapters, an unusual example of an [[unreliable narrator]]. The events take place mostly in and around [[Edinburgh]].

==Plot summary==

Colley is a "[[Gonzo journalist]]" with an [[amphetamine]] habit, living in Edinburgh. He also [[tobacco smoking|smokes]] [[cigarette]]s and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], drinks copious amounts of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], plays [[computer game]]s, and has adventurous sex with a married woman, Yvonne. He regrets his [[Substance dependence|addictions]] and misdemeanours and tries half-heartedly to give them up occasionally.

He reflects on his awful experience of witnessing the aftermath of the massacre at the '[[Highway of Death]]' in the [[Gulf War]], and covers the deployment of [[HMS Vanguard (S28)|HMS Vanguard]], Britain's first [[Trident missile|Trident]] nuclear missile [[submarine]].

He thinks he has a scoop when he receives anonymous phone calls about a series of mysterious deaths. Suddenly he has mysterious deaths of his own to worry about, when an [[editorial]] he wrote years before comes back to haunt him. In it, he suggested that certain named [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[right-wing]] public figures would be better hate-figures than the conventional ones of foreign leaders or domestic criminals. It seems someone is killing off the people on his list, one by one. The description of the murders (which are ingeniously [[sadism and masochism|sadistic]]) is done in a fairly detailed manner.

Under suspicion by the police, Colley finds himself involved doubly in the bizarre murders when the killer is revealed. At the end of the book, Colley is diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] (a downbeat ending omitted in the [[Complicity (film)|film adaptation]]).

==Literary significance &amp; criticism==
Banks claimed in an interview that ''Complicity'' is "[a] bit like ''[[The Wasp Factory]]'' except without the happy ending and redeeming air of cheerfulness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100221088/goodbye-iain-banks-it-takes-a-serious-man-to-laugh-at-himself/|title=Goodbye, Iain Banks: it takes a serious man to laugh at himself – Telegraph Blogs|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The themes of [[violence]] and [[substance abuse]] in the book, along with the grim ending, seem to point to Banks' growing [[pacifism]]. Significant sections of the novel are written in [[second-person narrative]].

There are scenes in the book telling of the main character's time at university. While the University isn't named the description of the locale points very strongly at this being Stirling University, where Iain Banks was himself a student.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
A motion picture called ''[[Complicity (film)|Complicity]]'' (or ''Retribution'' in some markets) based on the novel was filmed in 2000.

==Origins==
The unanticipated events of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973 and that of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 provoked a series of debates over the lack of early warning. The incident over the Falklands had taken the [[United Nations]] completely by surprise and it is said "no map of the islands was available in the Secretariat when the invasion began".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peck |first=Connie |date=1998 |title=Sustainable peace: the role of the UN and regional organizations in preventing conflict |series=Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict series |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |isbn=0847685608 |oclc=37180967 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=zycKkwkkzNAC&amp;pg=PA72 72] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial drivers, however, were humanitarian agencies "driven by the need for accurate and timely predictions of refugee flows to enable effective contingency planning".&lt;ref name="Nyheim"/&gt; After the end of the Cold War, political scientists at leading academic institutions began modifying old Cold War models of conflict to understand the onset of new wars. The horrors of the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]] also spurred increased interest in operational conflict early warning systems. The FAST project of Swisspeace&lt;ref name="FAST"/&gt; and the [[Forum on Early Warning and Early Response]] (FEWER) were responses to the [[genocide]].

The '''Corsican mafia''' is a set of criminal groups which are part of [[Milieu (organized crime in France)|the French Mob]], originating from [[Corsica]]. The Corsican mafia is an influential [[organized crime]] structure, operating in [[France]], [[Russia]], and many [[Africa|African]] and [[South America|Latin American]] countries. The most important groups of the Corsican mafia include the [[Unione Corse]] and the [[Gang de la Brise de Mer|Brise de Mer gang]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==History==
===The Union Corse and the French Connection era===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
The pre-war crime kings of [[Marseille]], [[Paul Carbone]] and [[François Spirito]], sided with Vichy and the Germans. During [[World War II]], the Corsican gang led by the Guerini brothers (Antoine and Barthélémy, nicknamed "Mémé") sided with the Gaullist part of the French Resistance. 

In 1947, Marseille was the main trading port of the French colonial empire and it had a [[communist]] mayor, Jean Christofol, who was backed by the trade unions, popular among longshoremen, transportation workers, and dockworkers. In the coming [[Cold War (1947–53)]], both the center-left French government and the US tried to fight communist influence in Marseille while occasionally employing illegal means to further their goal: The Guerini gang was employed to disrupt union and electoral gatherings, back strikebreakers and support US-funded non-communist trade unions.

From the 1950s to the 1960s, the Guerini brothers,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} were exempt from prosecution in Marseille. The Guerini brothers trafficked [[opium]] derivatives illegally imported from French Indochina using the services of the [[Messageries Maritimes]], a French merchant shipping company. 

From the 1960s to the early 1970s the major Corsican gangs called ''[[Unione Corse|Union Corse]]'' by American authorities organized the [[French Connection]], a [[heroin]] trade between France and the United States.

===The Corsican mafia today===
The end of the [[French Connection]] caused the disbandment of Corsican clans involved in the heroin trade. However, the evolution of the Corsican Mafia has continued in several illegal activities (hold-ups, [[racketeering]], [[casino]]s, illegal [[slot machine]]s, various [[Drug trafficking|drug dealing]] and [[prostitution]]). 

From the 1980s to the end of the 2000s, the Corsican mafia was split into two major groups; the [[Gang de la Brise de Mer|Brise de Mer]], based in Northern Corsica, and the Colonna clan (also named "Jean Jé Colonna's family"), based in Southern Corsica. A violent internal conflict troubled the Corsican mafia in 2007, resulting in around 102 [[murder]]s on the island of Corsica. This conflict caused the fall of these two groups and the rise of new Corsican gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/14/corsica-organized-crime_n_2472278.html|title=Corsica Organized Crime On The Rise|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, the Corsican mafia consists of multiple families, allies, and rivals. Known groups in the Corsican mafia are the Venzolasca gang (nickname in reference to the village of [[Venzolasca]], in northern Corsica, which are from key members of the gang), considered the [[Gang de la Brise de Mer|Brise de Mer]] successors. The "Petit Bar" gang (also called the "Tiny Bar"), the [[Arrondissement of Sartène|Valinco]] mobsters, and the Corsican mob of [[Marseille]] are also active.

'''Crucifixions and crucifixes''' have appeared in [[the arts]] and [[popular culture]] from before the era of the pagan [[Roman Empire]]. The [[crucifixion of Jesus]] has been depicted in [[religious art]] since the 4th century [[Common Era|CE]]. In more modern times, [[crucifixion]] has appeared in film and television as well as in fine art, and depictions of other historical crucifixions have appeared as well as the crucifixion of Christ. Modern art and culture have also seen the rise of images of crucifixion being used to make statements unconnected with [[Iconography#Christian iconography|Christian iconography]], or even just used for shock value.

In the first three centuries of [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian art]], the crucifixion was rarely depicted. Some [[engraved gem]]s thought to be 2nd or 3rd century have survived, but the subject does not appear in the art of the [[Catacombs of Rome]], and it is thought that at this period the image was restricted to [[heresy|heretical]] groups of Christians. The earliest Western images clearly originating in the mainstream of the church are 5th-century, including the scene on the doors of [[Santa Sabina]], Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–91, fig. 321&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] forbade crucifixion as a method of execution, and early church leaders regarded crucifixion with horror, and thus, as an unfit subject for artistic portrayal.&lt;ref name=Dreyer&gt;Elizabeth A. Dreyer, ''The Cross in Christian Tradition: From Paul to Bonaventure'', Paulist Press, 2001, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purported discovery of the [[True Cross]] by Constantine's mother, [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], and the development of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] as a site for [[pilgrimage]], together with the dispersal of fragments of the [[relic]] across the Christian world, led to a change of attitude.  It was probably in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that the image developed, and many of the earliest depictions are on the [[Monza ampullae]], small metal flasks for holy oil, that were pilgrim's souvenirs from the [[Holy Land]], as well as 5th-century [[ivory]] [[relief]]s from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–90, figs. 322–326&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the [[Middle Ages]], early Christians preferred to focus on the "triumphant" Christ, rather than a dying one, because the concept of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|risen Christ]] was so central to their faith.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3728859|title=Donne and the Crucifixion|first=Julia J.|last=Smith|date=1 January 1984|publisher=|journal=The Modern Language Review|volume=79|issue=3|pages=513–525|doi=10.2307/3728859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plain cross became depicted, often as a "glorified" symbol, as the [[crux gemmata]], covered with jewels, as many real early medieval [[processional cross]]es in goldsmith work were.

Early Byzantine depictions such as that in the [[Rabbula Gospels]] often show Christ flanked by [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]] and [[Stephaton]] with their spear and pole with vinegar. According to the gospels, the vinegar was offered just before Christ died, and the lance used just after, so the presence of the two flanking figures symbolizes the "double reality of God and man in Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 93&lt;/ref&gt; In images from after the end of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], Christ is shown as dead, but his "body is undamaged and there is no expression of pain"; the Eastern church held that Christ's body was invulnerable. The "S"-shaped slumped body type was developed in the 11th century. These images were one of the complaints against Constantinople given by Rome in the [[Great Schism of 1054]], although the [[Gero Cross]] in [[Cologne]] is probably nearly a century older.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western church ===
[[File:Cimabue 025.jpg|right|thumb|[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Santa Croce Crucifix]], {{convert|448|x|390|cm|1|abbr=on}}, by [[Cimabue]], [[Florence]], 1287–1288]]
The earliest Western images of a dead Christ may be in the [[Utrecht Psalter]], probably before 835.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99, 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;  Other early Western examples include the [[Gero Cross]] and the reverse of the [[Cross of Lothair]], both from the end of the 10th century. The first of these is the earliest near life-size sculpted cross to survive, and in its large scale represents "suffering in its extreme physical consequences", a trend that was to continue in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 141 quoted, 105–106, 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; Such figures, especially as [[rood]]s, large painted or sculpted crucifixes hung high in front of the [[chancel]] of churches, became very important in Western art, providing a sharp contrast with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] traditions, where the subject was never depicted in [[monumental sculpture]], and increasingly rarely even in small Byzantine ivories. By contrast, an [[Altar crucifix|altar cross]], almost always a [[crucifix]], became compulsory in Western churches in the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;That it should be a crucifix was first specified in the [[Roman Missal]] of 1570&lt;/ref&gt; and small wall-mounted crucifixes were increasingly popular in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] homes from the [[Counter-Reformation]], if not before.

As a broad generalization, the earliest depictions, before about 900, tended to show all three crosses (those of Jesus, the [[Penitent thief|Good Thief]] and the [[Impenitent thief|Bad Thief]]), but later medieval depictions mostly showed just Jesus and his cross. From the Renaissance either type might be shown. The number of other figures shown depended on the size and medium of the work, but there was a similar trend for early depictions to show a number of figures, giving way in the [[High Middle Ages]] to just the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and Saint [[John the Evangelist]], shown standing on either side of the cross, as in the [[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]] depictions, or sculpted or painted on panels at the end of each arm of a rood cross.

The soldiers were less likely to be shown, but others of the party with Mary and John might be. Angels were often shown in the sky, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] in some early depictions gave way to a small figure of [[God the Father]] in the heavens in some later ones, those these were always in the minority. Other elements that might be included were the sun and moon (evoking the [[Crucifixion darkness|darkening of the heavens]] at the moment of Christ’s death), and [[Ecclesia and Synagoga]]. Although according to the Gospel accounts his clothing was removed from Jesus before his crucifixion, most artists have thought it proper to represent his lower body as draped in some way. In one type of sculpted crucifix, of which the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Volto Santo in Lucca]] is the classic example, Christ continued to wear the long ''collobium'' robe of the Rabbula Gospels.
[[File:Giotto di bondone e collaboratore napoletano, crocifissione, 1328-1332 ca. 01.JPG|thumb|left|A crowded Gothic narrative treatment, workshop of [[Giotto]], c. 1330]]

In the Gothic period more elaborate narrative depictions developed, including many extra figures of [[Mary Magdalene]], disciples, especially [[The Three Marys]] behind the Virgin Mary, soldiers often including an officer on a horse, and angels in the sky. The moment when [[Saint Longinus|Longinus the centurion]] pierces Christ with his spear (the "[[Holy Lance]]") is often shown, and the blood and water spurting from Christ's side is often caught in a chalice held by an angel. In larger images the other two crosses might return, but most often not. In some works [[donor portrait]]s were included in the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–158&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions begin in the late 12th century, and become common where space allows in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Related scenes such as the ''[[Descent from the Cross|Deposition of Christ]]'', ''[[Entombment of Christ]]'' and ''Nailing of Christ to the Cross'' developed.  In the Late Middle Ages, increasingly intense and realistic representations of suffering were shown,&lt;ref&gt;Irene Earls, ''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary'', 1987, Greenwood Press, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the development of highly emotional [[andachtsbilder]] subjects and devotional trends such as [[German mysticism]]; some, like the [[Trinity#The Trinity in art|Throne of Mercy]], [[Man of Sorrows]] and [[Pietà]], related to the Crucifixion.  The same trend affected the depiction of other figures, notably in the "[[Swoon of the Virgin]]", who is very commonly shown fainting in paintings of between 1300 and 1500, though this depiction was attacked by theologians in the 16th century, and became unusual.  After typically more tranquil depictions during the [[Italian Renaissance]]—though not its [[Northern Renaissance|Northern equivalent]], which produced works such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]]—there was a return to intense emotionalism in the [[Baroque]], in works such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s [[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|''Elevation of the Cross'']].

The scene always formed part of a cycle of images of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' after about 600 (though it is noticeably absent before) and usually in one of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]''; the presence of Saint John made it a common subject for altarpieces in churches dedicated to him. From the late Middle Ages various new contexts for images were devised, from such large scale monuments as the [[Calvary (sculpture)|"calvaire"]] of [[Brittany]] and the [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] to the thousands of small [[wayside shrine]]s still found in many parts of Catholic Europe, and the [[Stations of the Cross]] in the majority of Catholic churches.

Crucifixion has appeared repeatedly as a theme in many forms of [[modern art]].

The [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]] painted ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', representing the cross as a [[hypercube]].

[[Porfirio DiDonna]]'s abstract ''Crucifixion'' is one of a number of religious works he painted in the 1960s, "blending the artist's devotion to the [[liturgy]] and his commitment to painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=John |title=Porfirio DiDonna: The Shape of Knowing |location=Brooklyn, NY |publisher=Pressed Wafer |year=2013 | page=36 |isbn=978-1-940396-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Welsh Window", given to the [[16th Street Baptist Church]] after it was bombed by four [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen in 1963, is a work of support and solidarity.

Other artists have used crucifixion imagery as a form of protest. In 1974, [[Chris Burden]] had himself crucified to a [[Volkswagen]]. Robert Cenedella painted a crucified Santa Claus as a protest against Christmas commercialization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcenedellagallery.com/slideshow.php?theme=Commentary&amp;i=5 RCenedella Gallery Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715160144/http://www.rcenedellagallery.com/slideshow.php?theme=Commentary&amp;i=5 |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; displayed in the window of New York's Art Students League in December 1997.

=== Popular art ===
Crucifixion in popular art, as with modern art, is sometimes used for its shock value. For example, a World War I [[Liberty bond]] poster by [[Fernando Amorsolo]] depicts a German soldier nailing an American soldier, his arms outspread, to the trunk of a tree. Crucifixion imagery is also used to make points in [[editorial cartoon|political cartoons]].

[[File:PassionPlay.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A passion play, Poland, 2006]]
{{Main|Passion play}}
Passion plays are dramatic presentations of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. They originated as expressions of devotion in the [[Middle Ages]]. In modern times, critics have said that some performances are [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name=Sennott&gt;Sennott, Charles M. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/04/10/in_poland_new_passion_plays_on_old_hatreds/ "In Poland, new 'Passion' plays on old hatreds"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and television ==

=== Film ===
Numerous movies have been produced which depict the crucifixion of Jesus. Some of these movies depict the crucifixion in its traditional sectarian form, while others intend to show a more historically accurate account. For example, ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), was probably the first movie to depict the nails being driven through Jesus' wrists, rather than his palms. [[Mel Gibson]]'s controversial ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004) depicted an extreme level of violence, but showed the nails being driven into Jesus' palms, as is traditional, with ropes supporting the wrists.

Although crucifixion imagery is common, few films depict actual crucifixion outside of a Christian context. ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) depicts the mass crucifixions of rebellious slaves along the [[Appian Way]] after the [[Third Servile War]]. The character Big Bob is crucified by cannibals in [[Wes Craven]]'s horror exploitation film ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977) as well as [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|its 2006 remake]]. ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) depicts [[Conan the Barbarian|the protagonist]] being crucified on the Tree of Woe.

The 1979 British comedy film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' ends with a comical sequence in which several of the cast, including Brian, are crucified by the Romans. The film ends with them all singing the song "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]". In this sequence, the characters are not nailed to the crosses, but tied at the wrists to the crossbar, and are standing on smaller crosspieces at foot level.

In the 2010 film [[Legion (2010 film)#Plot|''Legion'']], one of the diner patrons is found crucified upside down and covered with huge boils.

=== Television ===
Simulated crucifixions have been performed in [[professional wrestling]]. On the December 7, 1998, edition of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'', professional wrestling character [[The Undertaker]] crucified [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/11494884@N02/1382011485/|title=Stone Cold gets crucified by Undertaker on Taker's symbol|work=flickr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 1996, in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], during a feud with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], instructed his [[Raven's Nest]] to crucify Sandman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestlinggonewrong.com/video/sandman_crucifixion.html|title=Wrestlinggonewrong.com|work=wrestlinggonewrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other television performers have used crucifixion to make a point. The [[Australians|Australian]] [[comedian]] [[John Safran]] had himself crucified in the [[Philippines]] as part of a [[Good Friday]] [[Crucifixion#As a devotional practice|crucifixion ritual]] for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] show, ''[[John Safran's Race Relations]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/safran-crucifixion-disrespectful-immoral/story-e6frfkp9-1225699011366, Philippines villagers bewildered by John Safran comedy stunt]&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Robbie Williams]] performed a stunt on an April 2006 [[Easter]] Sunday show shown on the UK television channel [[Channel 4]], in which he was affixed to a cross and pierced with needles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywood.premiere.com/news/music/story/church_slams_williams_crucifixion_stunt/|title=Church Slams Williams Crucifixion Stunt|work=premiere.com}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HBO]] television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' (2005–2007) contained several depictions of crucifixion, as it was a common torture method during the historical period the show takes place in.

In the 2010 ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'' television series ''[[Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]'', Segovax, a slave recruit to the gladiatorial [[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]] of Lentulus Batiatus, attempts to assassinate Spartacus in the ludus washrooms and is crucified for doing so "after being parted from his cock".

Crucifixion has been depicted in the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (1995–2001), where its depiction has been cited in feminist studies as illustrating violent and misogynist tendencies within a messianic paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Kathleen|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14680770701477966|title=Xena On The Cross|journal=Feminist Media Studies|accessdate=December 12, 2011|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3|pages=313–332|doi=10.1080/14680770701477966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series "Vikings", the character Æthelstan, after being captured by the Saxons and named an apostate, is shown wearing a crown of thorns and being nailed to a cross. After the cross is raised he is taken down at the order of King Ecbert.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The Japanese science fiction series [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]] features crucifixion as a recurring motif.

== Music ==

=== Classical music ===
[[File:Weyden Christ on the Cross with Mary and St John.jpg|thumb|right|In music, ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' refers to compositions of a [[hymn]] of the same name, while ''[[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]]'' in art is a specific form of depiction, as in this painting by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], circa 1460.]]
{{Main|Passion music}}
Famous depictions of crucifixion in classical music include the ''[[St John Passion]]'' and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]]'s setting of ''[[Stabat Mater]]''. Notable recent settings include the [[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|''St. Luke Passion'']] (1965) by Polish composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the [[Passio (Pärt)|''St. John Passion'']] (1982) by Estonian composer [[Arvo Pärt]]. The 2000 work, ''[[La Pasión según San Marcos (Golijov)|La Pasión según San Marcos]]'' (St. Mark Passion) by Argentinian Jewish composer [[Osvaldo Golijov]], was named one of the top classical compositions of the decade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121772989&amp;ps=bb2|accessdate=April 2, 2010|first=Tom|last=Huizenga|title=The Decade In Classical Recordings|date=December 27, 2009|publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of traditional passion motifs with [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[Capoeira]], and [[Kaddish]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onpointradio.org/2010/04/osvaldo-golijovs-musical-passion|accessdate=April 2, 2010|title=Osvaldo Golijov's Musical "Passion"|date=April 2, 2010|publisher=wbur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucifixion has figured prominently in Easter [[Passion cantata|cantatas]], [[oratorio]]s, and [[requiem]]s. The third section of a full [[mass (music)|mass]], the ''Credo'', contains the following passage at its climax: ''"Crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub Pontio Pilato, passus et sepultus est,"'' which means "And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; he suffered and was buried." This passage was sometimes set to music separately as a ''Crucifixus'', the most famous example being that of [[Antonio Lotti]] for eight voices.

The [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|seven utterances of Jesus while on the Cross]], gathered from the four gospels, have inspired [[Musical settings of The Seven Last Words of Christ|many musical compositions]], from [[Heinrich Schütz]] in 1645 to Ruth Zechlin in 1996, with the best known being [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''[[The Seven Last Words of Christ]]'', composed in 1787.

Depictions of crucifixion outside the Christian context are rare. One of the few examples is in [[Ernest Reyer]]'s opera ''[[Salammbô (Reyer)|Salammbô]]'' (1890).

=== Popular music ===
The 1970 [[rock opera]] [[Jesus Christ Superstar]] by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] ends with Jesus' crucifixion.

The cover art of [[Tupac Shakur]]'s album [[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]] features an image of Tupac being crucified on a cross. He stated that the image was not a mockery of Christ; rather, it showed how he was being "crucified" by the media.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Multiple [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] videos such as "I Don't Like The Drugs But The Drugs Like Me" and "Coma White" feature crucifixion imagery, often oddly staged in surreal modern or near modern-day settings. The Norwegian black metal band [[Gorgoroth]] had several people on stage affixed to crosses to give the appearance of crucifixion at a now infamous concert in [[Kraków]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jonathan Tisdall |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Norwegian black metal band shocks Poland – Aftenposten.no |publisher=Aftenposten.no |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309110157/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |archivedate=2009-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated this act in the music video for "Carving a Giant." In 2006, singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] caused controversy by opening a concert held near [[Vatican City]] with a mock crucifixion, complete with a [[crown of thorns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=387254&amp;in_page_id=1773|title=Madonna under fire over mock crucifixion|work=dailymail.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9045">[[File:SenseAndSensibilityTitlePage.jpg|thumb|upright| The title page of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', [[Jane Austen]]'s debut novel published in 1811.]]

A '''debut novel''' is the '''first [[novel]]''' a [[novelist]] publishes. Debut novels are often the author's first opportunity to make an impact on the [[publishing industry]], and thus the success or failure of a debut novel can affect the ability of the author to publish in the future.&lt;ref name = independent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-big-question-what-should-you-do-if-you-want-to-get-your-first-novel-published-768098.html |title=The Big Question: What should you do if you want to get your first novel published? - Features, Books |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''First-time novelists''' without a previous published reputation, such as publication in nonfiction, magazines, or [[literary journals]], typically struggle to find a publisher.

Sometimes new novelists will [[self-publish]] their debut novels, because publishing houses will not risk the capital needed to market books by an unknown author to the public.&lt;ref name = independent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kapur |first=Niraj |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/jan/26/howtosellyourfirstnovel |title=How to sell your debut novel &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=The Guardian |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most publishers purchase rights to novels, especially debut novels, through [[literary agents]], who screen client work before sending it to publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/10/08/224084404/first-novels-the-romance-of-agents| title =First Novels: The Romance Of Agents| first =Martha| last = Woodroof| publisher = NPR| work = Monkey See|date = October 8, 2013| accessdate = October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hurdles to publishing reflect both publishers' limits in resources for reviewing and publishing unknown works, and that readers typically buy more books by established authors with a reputation than first-time writers. For this reason, literary communities have created awards that help acknowledge exceptional debut novels.

==Publishing and recognition==
In contemporary British and American publishing markets, most authors receive only a small monetary advance before publication of their debut novel; in the rare exceptions when a large print run and high volume of sales are anticipated, the advance can be larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kellaway, Kate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/25/fiction.features7 | title=Kate Kellaway: That difficult first novel &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; |work=[[The Observer]] | publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 March 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an example of an unusually high advance: in 2013, the highly anticipated ''[[City on Fire (2015 novel)|City on Fire]]'' by [[Garth Risk Hallberg]] captured the attention of ten publishers who started a bidding war that ended with [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] buying the rights to the book for 2 million dollars. The book's film production rights were purchased soon after by producer [[Scott Rudin]]. &lt;ref name&gt;{{cite news|title = ‘City on Fire,’ a Debut Novel, Fetches Nearly $2 Million| first =  Julie| last = Bosman| newspaper = New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/media/city-on-fire-a-debut-novel-fetches-nearly-2-million.html?_r=0|date = November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For similar reasons that advances are frequently not very large—novels frequently don't sell well until the author gains a literary reputation. There are exceptions, however;  YouTube star [[Zoella]] published her debut novel ''[[Girl Online]]'' in November  2014, and the book sold 78,109 copies in Britain in its first week.&lt;ref name = Zoella&gt;{{cite news|title = Zoella breaks record for first-week book sales| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11268540/Zoella-breaks-record-for-first-week-book-sales.html |first = Anita | last = Singh| newspaper = The Telegraph| date = December 2, 2014| accessdate = December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel saw huge sales because she already had an established audience, and publishers were willing to run a large print run.&lt;ref name= Zoella/&gt;  By comparison, bestselling  ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' sold 14,814 copies in its first week, or later popular novels, like ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', only receive small initial print runs.&lt;ref name = Zoella/&gt; Debut novels that do well will be reprinted as sales increase due to word of mouth popularity of the novels — publishers don't often run large marketing campaigns for debut novelists.&lt;ref name = Zoella/&gt;

There are numerous [[:Category:First book awards|literary prizes for debut novels]] often associated with genre or nationality. These prizes are in recognition of the difficulties faced by debut novelists and bring attention to deserving works and authors. Some of the more prestigious awards around the world include the American [[Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award]], the French [[Prix Goncourt du Premier Roman]], the British [[Guardian First Book Award]], the German [[Aspekte-Literaturpreis]] and the Japanese [[Noma Literary Prize]]. ''The New York Times'' commentator Leslie Jamison described the big, and often very public, "to do" about debut novels and novelists created by these book awards, as associated with the excitement of finding authors and writers without established legacies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/books/review/why-do-debut-novels-command-so-much-attention.html|title=Why Do Debut Novels Command So Much Attention?|last=Jamison|first=Leslie|date=2016-08-30|last2=Mathis|first2=Ayana|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same piece for the ''Times,'' Ayana Mathis describes the debut novel as a "a piece of the writer’s soul in a way that subsequent books can’t ever be", because the novel is necessarily a work of passion and a product of all of their life before that moment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Literary characteristics==
Often an author's first novel will not be as complex stylistically or thematically as subsequent works and often will not feature the author's typical literary characteristics. ''[[Huffington Post]]'''s Dave Astor attributes these to two forces: first that authors are still learning their own [[literary style|unique style]] and audiences are more willing to read works from unknown authors if they resemble more conventional styles of literature.&lt;ref name = DAstor&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-astor/famous-authors-early-books_b_1353275.html| title = Many Famous Authors Started With 'Novel 101'| first = David| last = Astor|accessdate = September 23, 2013| date = 2012-03-20| newspaper = Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, Astor points to J.R.R. Tolkien's ''[[The Hobbit (novel)|The Hobbit]]'' (1937), Margaret Atwood's ''[[The Edible Woman]]'' (1969) and Charles Dickens' ''[[The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club]]'' (1837), all of which lack the complexity or stylistic characteristics which audiences praise in the authors' later work.&lt;ref name = DAstor/&gt; Sometimes, instead of writing novels to begin their career, some authors will start with [[short stories]], which can be easier to publish and allow authors to get started in writing fiction.&lt;ref name = DAstor/&gt;

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the earliest attested usage of "first novel" is from 1876.&lt;ref&gt;See entry for "first novel" in [[OED]], Second Edition 1989, online version, accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term is much older, with instances going back to at least 1800.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Bisset]] (1800). ''[https://archive.org/details/douglasorhighlan03biss Douglas; or, The Highlander]'',[https://archive.org/stream/douglasorhighlan03biss#page/306/mode/2up/search/%22first+novel%22 pg. 306]. "Her first novel is a pretty and affecting tale".&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' doesn't have an entry for "debut novel." The earliest usage of "debut novel" in the [[Google Books]] database is 1930 ({{As of|2011|lc=y}}).&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association (1930). ''A.L.A. Booklist'', Volume 27. Publishing Board, League of Library Commissions (U.S.).[https://books.google.com/books?id=8zFVAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22debut+novel%22&amp;dq=%22debut+novel%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YU4DTpz_Oc7SgQf-_f31DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA pg. 423], "A debut novel, mature as to style and composition.."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Google Books Ngram Viewer]] shows it becoming more widely used after about 1980, gaining in popularity since.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=debut+novel&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2016&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3 Google Books Ngram: debut novel].

'''Digital painting''' is an emerging art form in which traditional painting techniques such as [[watercolor]], [[Oil paint|oils]], [[impasto]], etc. are applied using digital tools by means of a [[computer]], a [[digitizing tablet]] and [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]], and [[software]]. Traditional painting is painting with a physical medium as opposed to a more modern style like digital. Digital painting differs from other forms of [[digital art]], particularly [[computer-generated art]], in that it does not involve the computer rendering from a model.  The artist uses painting techniques to create the digital painting directly on the computer. All digital painting programs try to mimic the use of physical media through various brushes and paint effects.  Included in many programs are brushes that are digitally styled to represent the traditional style like oils, acrylics, pastels, charcoal, pen and even media such as airbrushing.  There are also certain effects unique to each type of digital paint which portray the realistic effects of say watercolor on a digital 'watercolor' painting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corel.com/servlet/ContentServer/us/en/Product/1166553941991&lt;/ref&gt; In most digital painting programs, the users can create their own brush style using a combination of texture and shape.  This ability is very important in bridging the gap between traditional and digital painting.

Digital painting thrives mostly in production art. It is most widely used in conceptual design for film, television and video games. Digital painting software such as [[Corel Painter]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[ArtRage]], [[GIMP]], [[Krita]] and [[openCanvas]] give artists a similar environment to a physical painter: a canvas, painting tools, mixing palettes, and a multitude of color options.
There are various types of digital painting, including [[impressionism]], realism, and watercolor. There are both benefits and drawbacks of digital painting.  While digital painting allows the artist the ease of working in an organized, mess-free environment, some argue there will always be more control for an artist holding a physical brush in their hand. Some artists believe there is something missing from digital painting, such as the character that is unique to every physically made object.  Many artists post blogs and comment on the various differences between digitally created work and traditionally created artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vindicated13.wordpress.com/2007/11/13/art-traditional-vs-digital/ Art: Traditional vs. Digital « Vindicated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.deviantart.com/galleries/digital/1061392/ deviantART Forum: Traditional painting vs Digital painting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with traditional painting==

The main difference between digital and traditional painting is the non-linear process. That is, an artist can often arrange his painting in layers that can be edited independently. Also, the ability to undo and redo strokes frees the artist from a linear process. But digital painting is limited in how it employs the techniques and study of a traditional painter because of the surface differences and lack of physicality. The [[digital artist]] has at his disposal several tools not available to the traditional painter.  Some of these include: a virtual palette consisting of millions of colors, almost any size canvas or media, and the ability to take back mistakes, as well as erasers, pencils, spray cans, brushes, combs, and a variety of 2D and 3D effect tools.  A [[graphics tablet]] allows the artist to work with precise hand movements simulating a real pen and drawing surface. Even the traditional surface has changed for digital painting. Instead of a canvas or sketchbook, artists would use a mouse or tablet to display strokes that would appear with the touch of a pen to the tablet’s surface, or a click of pen.  Tablets can be pressure sensitive, allowing the artist to vary the intensity of the chosen media on the screen.  There are tablets with over two thousand different levels of pressure sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wacom.com/intuos/12x19.cfm Intuos3 12x19 - Product Overview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===Sketchpad===
[[Image:Wacom Pen-tablet.jpg|thumb|Many artists prefer using graphics tablets to create digital paintings instead of using a mouse.]]
The earliest graphical manipulation program was called [[Sketchpad]].  Created in 1963 by [[Ivan Sutherland]], a grad student at [[MIT]], Sketchpad allowed the user to manipulate objects on a CRT ([[cathode ray tube]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitepoint.com/article/real-history-gui/4 The Real History of the GUI [Design Principles&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sketchpad eventually led to the creation of the Rand Tablet for work on the GRAIL project in 1968, and the very first tablet was created.  Other early tablets, or digitizers, like the ID (intelligent digitizer) and the BitPad were commercially successful and used in CAD (Computer Aided Design) programs. Modern day tablets are the tools of choice by digital painters.  WACOM is the industry leader in tablets which can range in size from 4” x 6” all the way to 12” x 19” and are less than an inch thick. Other brands of graphic tablets are Aiptek, Monoprice, Hanvon, Genius, Adesso, Trust, Manhattan, Vistablet, DigiPro, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://0.tqn.com/d/performingarts/1/0/9/7/-/-/GraphicsTabletComparisonChart.jpg Comparison chart of graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://painting.about.com/lr/graphics_tablet/1917/1/ Links to many graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/aboutgraphics/a/graphicstablets.htm Sue Chastain, editor about graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;
All these graphic tablets have the basic functions of a mouse, so they can be used as a mouse, not only in graphic editors but also as a replacement for a mouse, and they are compatible with practically all Windows and Macintosh software.

===Tablets===
The idea of using a [[graphics tablet|tablet]] to communicate directions to a computer has been an idea since 1968 when the RAND (Research and Development) company out of Santa Monica, developed the [[RAND tablet]] that was used to program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/research/videohistory_catalog9536.html Smithsonian Institution Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Digitizers were popularized in the mid 1970s and early 1980s by the commercial success of the ID (Intelligent Digitizer) and BitPad manufactured by the Summagraphics Corp. These digitizers were used as the input device for many high-end [[CAD]] ([[Computer Aided Design]]) systems as well as bundled with [[Personal computer|PC]]'s and PC based CAD software like [[AutoCAD]].

===MacPaint===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:MacpaintWP.png|thumb|MacPaint 1.0]] --&gt;
The first commercial program that allowed users to design, draw, and manipulate objects was the program [[MacPaint]]. This program’s first version was introduced on January 22, 1984 on the [[Apple Lisa]].  The ability to freehand draw and create graphics with this program made it the top program of its kind during 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/31/science/personal-computers-software-for-the-macintosh-plenty-on-the-way.html?sec=technology&amp;pagewanted=2 Personal Computers; Software For The Macintosh: Plenty On The Way - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   The earlier versions of the program were called MacSketch and LisaSketch, and the last version of MacPaint was MacPaint 2.0 released in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4BlmsN4q2I&amp;feature=related YouTube - Apple Lisa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of MacPaint's universal success was attributed to the release of the first Macintosh computer which was equipped with one other program called [[MacWrite]].  It was the first personal computer with a graphical user interface and lost much of the bulky size of its predecessor, the Lisa.  The Macintosh was available at about $2500 and the combination of a smaller design made the computer a hit, exposing the average computer user to the graphical possibilities of the included MacPaint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitepoint.com/article/real-history-gui/5- The Real History of the GUI [Design Principles&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended.png|thumb|Adobe Photoshop CS3]] --&gt;
Another early image manipulation program was [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It was first called Display and was created in 1987 by [[Thomas Knoll]] at the [[University of Michigan]] as monochrome picture display program.  With help from his brother John, the program was turned into an image editing program called Imagepro, but later changed to Photoshop.  The Knolls agreed on a deal with [[Adobe systems]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and Photoshop 1.0 was released in 1991 for Macintosh. [[Adobe systems]] had previously release Adobe Illustrator 1.0 in 1986 on the Apple Macintosh. These two programs, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are currently two of the top programs used in the productions of digital paintings.  Illustrator introduced the uses of [[Bezier curves]] which allowed the user to be incredibly detailed in their [[vector graphics|vector drawings]].

===Kid Pix===
In 1988, Craig Hickman created a paint program called [[Kid Pix]], which made it easier for children to use MacPaint. The program was originally created in black in white, and after several revisions was released in color in 1991.  Kid Pix was one of the first commercial programs to integrate color and sound in a creative format. While the Kid Pix was intentionally created for children, it became a useful tool for introducing adults to the computer as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pixelpoppin.com/kidpix/ Kid Pix: The Early Years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web-based painting programs===
In recent years there has been a growth in the websites which support  painting digitally online. 
The user is still drawing digitally with the use of software: often the software is on the server of the website which is being used. However, with the emergence of html5, some programs now partly use the client's web browser to handle some of the processing. The range of tools and brushes can be more limited than free standing software. Speed of response, quality of colour and the ability to save to a file or print are similar in either media.

{{Anthropology |social/cultural}}

'''Economic anthropology''' is a field that attempts to explain human [[Economy|economic]] behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It is practiced by anthropologists and has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chibnik|first1=Michael|title=Anthropology, Economics, and Choice|date=2011|publisher=University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology began with work by the Polish founder of anthropology [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] and the French [[Marcel Mauss]] on the nature of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] as an alternative to [[Market (economics)|market exchange]]. For the most part, studies in economic anthropology focus on [[Trade|exchange]]. In contrast, the [[Marx]]ian school known as "[[Political economy in anthropology|political economy]]" focuses on [[Production (economics)|production]].&lt;!--[Drifting off-topic?:] The large body of work on the [[anthropology of development]] is also dealt with in a separate article.--&gt;

Post-[[World War II]], economic anthropology was highly influenced by the work of economic historian [[Karl Polanyi]]. Polanyi drew on anthropological studies to argue that true market exchange was limited to a restricted number of western, industrial societies. Applying formal economic theory (Formalism) to non-industrial societies was mistaken, he argued. In non-industrial societies, exchange was "embedded" in such non-market institutions as kinship, religion, and politics (an idea he borrowed from Mauss). He labelled this approach [[Substantivism]]. [[The Formalist vs Substantivist debate]] was highly influential and defined an era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hann |first=Chris |title=Economic Anthropology |year=2011 |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=55–71 |author2=Keith Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[globalization]] became a reality, and the division between market and non-market economies –&amp;nbsp;between "the West and the Rest"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The West and the Rest: Discourse and Power|last=Hall|first=Stuart|publisher=Polity Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=https://analepsis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/hall-west-the-rest.pdf|pages=185-225}}&lt;/ref&gt; – became untenable, anthropologists began to look at the relationship between a variety of ''types'' of exchange within market societies. Neo-substantivists examine the ways in which so-called pure market exchange in market societies fails to fit market ideology. Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists. They now study the operations of corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.

== Reciprocity and the gift ==

===Malinowski and Mauss on Kula exchange===
Bronislaw Malinowski's path-breaking work, ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific'' (1922), addressed the question, "why would men risk life and limb to travel across huge expanses of dangerous ocean to give away what appear to be worthless trinkets?" (He could have asked this as well about the Dutch giving trinkets to the aboriginals of Manhattan Island). Malinowski carefully traced the network of exchanges of bracelets and necklaces across the [[Trobriand Islands]], and established that they were part of a system of exchange (the [[Kula ring]]). He stated that this exchange system was clearly linked to political authority.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 453–73"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parry|first=Jonathan|title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift'|journal=Man|year=1986|volume=21|issue=3|pages=453–73|doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and later, Malinowski's study became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of ''The Gift'' (''Essai sur le don,'' 1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mauss|first=Marcel|title=The Gift: Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies|year=1970|publisher=Cohen &amp; West|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malinowski emphasised the exchange of goods between ''individuals'', and their non-altruistic motives for giving: they expected a return of equal or greater value. In other words, [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] is an implicit part of gifting; no "free gift" is given without expectation of reciprocity.

Mauss, in contrast, has emphasized that the gifts were not between individuals, but between representatives of larger collectivities. These gifts were, he argued, a "total prestation." They were not simple, alienable commodities to be bought and sold, but, like the "[[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown jewels]]", embodied the reputation, history and sense of identity of a "corporate kin group," such as a line of kings. Given the stakes, Mauss asked "why anyone would give them away?" His answer was an enigmatic concept, hau, "the spirit of the gift." A good part of the confusion (and resulting debate) was due to a bad translation. Mauss appeared to be arguing that a return gift is given to keep the very relationship between givers alive; a failure to return a gift ends the relationship and the promise of any future gifts. Based on an improved translation, [[Jonathan Parry]] has demonstrated that Mauss was arguing that the concept of a "pure gift" given altruistically only emerges in societies with a well-developed market ideology.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 453–73"/&gt;

[[File:Trobriand.png|thumb|right|350px]]

Mauss' concept of "total prestations" has been developed in the later 20th century by [[Annette Weiner]], who revisited Malinowski's fieldsite in the Trobriand Islands. Her 1992 critique was twofold: she noted first that Trobriand Island society has a [[matrilineal]] kinship system, and that women hold a great deal of economic and political power, as inheritance is passed through the female lines. Malinowski missed this and ignored women's exchanges in his study. Secondly, Weiner has developed Mauss' argument about reciprocity and the "spirit of the gift" in terms of "[[inalienable possessions]]: the paradox of keeping while giving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-while-Giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner contrasts "moveable goods," which can be exchanged, with "immoveable goods," which serve to draw the gifts back (in the Trobriand case, male Kula gifts are moveable gifts compared to those of women's landed property). She argues that the specific goods given, such as [[Crown Jewels]], are so identified with particular groups that, even when given, they are not truly alienated. Not all societies, however, have these kinds of goods, which depend upon the existence of particular kinds of kinship groups. French anthropologist [[Maurice Godelier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godelier|first=Maurice|title=The Enigma of the Gift|year=1999|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; pushed the analysis further in ''The Enigma of the Gift'' (1999).&lt;ref name="Schrauwers"/&gt;

Albert Schrauwers has argued that the kinds of societies used as examples by Weiner and Godelier (including the [[Kula ring]] in the Trobriands, the [[Potlatch]] of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] in the United States and Canada, and the [[Toraja]] of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]) are all characterized by ranked aristocratic kin groups that fit with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' model of "House Societies" (where "House" refers to both noble lineage and their landed estate). Total prestations are given, he argues, to preserve landed estates identified with particular kin groups and maintain their place in a ranked society.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and Class: On the importance of capitals in central Sulawesi|journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|year=2004|volume=160|issue=1|pages=72–94|doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Toraja house.jpg|thumb|left|Three ''tongkonan'' noble houses in a Torajan village.]]

=== Gifts and commodities ===
{{main|Moka exchange}}
The misunderstanding about what Mauss meant by "the spirit of the gift" led some anthropologists to contrast "gift economies" with "market economies," presenting them as polar opposites and implying that non-market exchange was always altruistic. [[Marshall Sahlins]], a well-known American cultural anthropologist, identified three main types of reciprocity in his book ''Stone Age Economics'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sahlins | first = Marshall |authorlink=Marshall Sahlins | title = Stone Age Economics | publisher = Aldine-Atherton | location = Chicago | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-202-01099-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gift or ''generalized reciprocity'' is the exchange of goods and services without keeping track of their exact value, but often with the expectation that their value will balance out over time. ''Balanced or Symmetrical reciprocity'' occurs when someone gives to someone else, expecting a fair and tangible return - at a specified amount, time, and place. Market or ''Negative reciprocity'' is the exchange of goods and services whereby each party intends to profit from the exchange, often at the expense of the other. Gift economies, or generalized reciprocity, occur within closely knit kin groups, and the more distant the exchange partner, the more imbalanced or negative the exchange becomes.

This opposition was classically expressed by [[Chris Gregory]] in his book "Gifts and Commodities" (1982). Gregory argued that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Commodity exchange is an exchange of '''alienable''' objects between people who are in a state of reciprocal '''independence''' that establishes a '''quantitative''' relationship between the '''objects''' exchanged… Gift exchange is an exchange of '''inalienable''' objects between people who are in a state of reciprocal '''dependence''' that establishes a '''qualitative''' relationship between the '''transactors'''" (emphasis added.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=Chris|title=Gifts and Commodities|year=1982|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

|}

Other anthropologists, however, refused to see these different "[[Spheres of exchange|exchange spheres]]" as polar opposites. [[Marilyn Strathern]], writing on a similar area in Papua New Guinea, dismissed the utility of the opposition in ''The Gender of the Gift'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strathern|first=Marilyn|title=The Gender of the Gift: Problems with Women and Problems with Society in Melanesia|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=143–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spheres of exchange===
{{main|Spheres of exchange}}
The relationship of new market exchange systems to indigenous non-market exchange remained a perplexing question for anthropologists. [[Paul Bohannan]] (see below, under substantivism) argued that the Tiv of Nigeria had three spheres of exchange, and that only certain kinds of goods could be exchanged in each sphere; each sphere had its own different form of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohannan|first=Paul|title=The Impact of money on an African subsistence economy|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=1959|volume=19|issue=4|pages=491–503|doi=10.1017/S0022050700085946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Clifford Geertz]]'s model of "dual economy" in Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Agricultural involution; the process of ecological change in Indonesia|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press for the Association of Asian Studies|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[James C. Scott]]'s model of "moral economy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=James C.|title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|year=1976|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  hypothesized different exchange spheres emerging in societies newly integrated into the market; both hypothesized a continuing culturally ordered "traditional" exchange sphere resistant to the market. Geertz used the sphere to explain peasant complacency in the face of exploitation, and Scott to explain peasant rebellion. This idea was taken up lastly by Jonathan Parry and [[Maurice Bloch]], who argued in ''Money and the Morality of Exchange'' (1989) that the "transactional order" through which long-term social reproduction of the family takes place has to be preserved as separate from short-term market relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parry|first=Jonathan|title=Money and the Morality of Exchange|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=28–30|authorlink=Introduction: Money and the Morality of Exchange|author2=Maurice Bloch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity: "the poison of the gift"===
[[File:SharonTemple.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Sharon Temple]], [[Sharon, Ontario]] circa 1860.]]
In his classic summation of the gift exchange debate, Jonathan Parry highlighted that ideologies of the "pure gift" (as opposed to total prestations) "is most likely to arise in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parry|first=Jonathan|title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift'|journal=Man|year=1986|volume=21|issue=3|pages=467|doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schrauwers illustrated the same points in two different areas in the context of the "transition to capitalism debate" (see ''[[Political economy in anthropology|Political Economy]]''). He documented the transformations among the [[Pamona people|To Pamona]] of [[Central Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]], as they were incorporated in global market networks over the twentieth century. As their everyday production and consumption activities were increasingly commodified, they developed an oppositional gift (''posintuwu'') exchange system that funded social reproductive activities, thereby preserving larger kin, political and religious groups. This "pure gift" exchange network emerged from an earlier system of "total prestations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Colonial "Reformation" in the Highlands of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, 1892-1995|year=2000|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=129–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:To Pamona Bridewealth exchange.jpg|thumb|left|'Free gifts' of Posintuwu culminate in the exchange of bridewealth at a [[Pamona people|To Pamona]] wedding.]]
Similarly, in analyzing the same "transition to capitalist debate" in early 19th century North America, Schrauwers documented how new, oppositional "[[Moral economy|moral economies]]" grew in parallel with the emergence of the market economy. As the market became increasingly institutionalized, so too did early [[Owenism|utopian socialist]] experiments such as the [[The Children of Peace|Children of Peace]], in [[Sharon, Ontario]], Canada. They built an ornate temple dedicated to sacralizing the giving of charity; this was eventually institutionalized as a mutual credit organization, land sharing, and co-operative marketing. In both cases, Schrauwers emphasizes that these alternate exchange spheres are tightly integrated and mutualistic with markets as commodities move in and out of each circuit.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title='Money bound you – money shall loose you': Gift Giving, Social Capital and the Meaning of Money in Upper Canada|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=2011|volume=53|issue=2|pages=1–30|doi=10.1017/S0010417511000077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parry had also underscored, using the example of charitable giving of alms in India ([[Dāna]]), that the "pure gift" of alms given with no expectation of return could be "poisonous." That is, the gift of alms embodying the sins of the giver, when given to ritually pure priests, saddled these priests with impurities that they could not cleanse themselves of. "Pure gifts" given without a return, can place recipients in debt, and hence in dependent status: the poison of the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parry|first=Jonathan|title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift'|journal=Man|year=1986|volume=21|issue=3|pages=463–67|doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Children of Peace tried to sacralize the pure giving of alms, they found charity created difficulties for recipients. It highlighted their near bankruptcy and hence opened them to lawsuits and indefinite imprisonment for debt. Rather than accept charity, the free gift, they opted for loans.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers 2011" /&gt;

=== 'The social life of things' and singularization ===
{{main|Commodity Pathway Diversion}}
[[File:Wedding rings.jpg|thumbnail|Wedding rings: commodity or pure gift?]]
Rather than emphasize how particular kinds of objects are either gifts or commodities to be traded in restricted spheres of exchange, [[Arjun Appadurai]] and others began to look at how objects flowed between these spheres of exchange. They shifted attention away from the character of the human relationships formed through exchange, and placed it on "the social life of things" instead. They examined the strategies by which an object could be "[[Commodity Pathway Diversion|singularized]]" (made unique, special, one-of-a-kind) and so withdrawn from the market. A marriage ceremony that transforms a purchased ring into an irreplaceable family heirloom is one example; the heirloom, in turn, makes a perfect gift.

Singularization is the reverse of the seemingly irresistible process of commodification. These scholars show how all economies are a constant flow of material objects that enter and leave specific exchange spheres. A similar approach is taken by [[Nicholas Thomas]], who examines the same range of cultures and the anthropologists who write about them, and redirects attention to the "entangled objects" and their roles as both gifts and commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Nicholas|title=Entangled Objects: Exchange, Material Culture, and Colonialism in the Pacific|year=1991|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This emphasis on things has led to new explorations in "consumption studies" (see below).

== Cultural construction of economic systems: the substantivist approach==

===Formalist vs substantivist debate===
{{main|The formalist vs substantivist debate}}
[[File:El Cerrito, San Miguel County, New Mexico. The staple crops in El Cerrito are corn, beans and alfal . . . - NARA - 521202.jpg|thumbnail|left|Non-market subsistence farming in New Mexico: household provisioning or 'economic' activity?]]
The opposition between [[Substantivism|substantivist]] and formalist economic models was first proposed by [[Karl Polanyi]] in his work ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]'' (1944). He argued that the term 'economics' has two meanings: the formal meaning refers to economics as the logic of rational action and decision-making, as rational choice between the alternative uses of limited (scarce) means. The second, substantive meaning, however, presupposes neither rational decision-making nor conditions of scarcity. It simply refers to the study of how humans make a living from their social and natural environment. A society's livelihood strategy is seen as an adaptation to its environment and material conditions, a process which may or may not involve utility maximisation. The substantive meaning of 'economics' is seen in the broader sense of 'economising' or 'provisioning'. Economics is simply the way members of society meet their material needs. Anthropologists embraced the substantivist position as empirically oriented, as it did not impose western cultural assumptions on other societies where they might not be warranted. The Formalist vs. Substantivist debate was not between anthropologists and economists, however, but a disciplinary debate largely confined to the journal ''Research in Economic Anthropology.'' In many ways, it reflects the common debates between [[Emic and etic|"etic" and "emic"]] explanations as defined by [[Marvin Harris]] in cultural anthropology of the period. The principal proponents of the substantivist model were George Dalton and [[Paul Bohannan]]. Formalists such as [[Raymond Firth]] and [[Harold K. Schneider]] asserted that the neoclassical model of economics could be applied to any society if appropriate modifications are made, arguing that its principles have universal validity.

For some anthropologists, the substantivist position does not go far enough. [[Stephen Gudeman]], for example, argues that the processes of making a livelihood are culturally constructed. Therefore, models of livelihoods and related economic concepts such as [[Trade|exchange]], [[money]] or [[Profit (economics)|profit]] must be analyzed through the locals' ways of understanding them. Rather than devising universal models rooting in Western economic [[terminology|terminologies]] and then applying them indiscriminately to all societies, scholars must come to understand the 'local model'.

===Stephen Gudeman and the culturalist approach===
In his work on livelihoods, Gudeman seeks to present the "people's own economic construction" (1986:1);&lt;ref name="gudeman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gudeman, S.|title=Economics as culture : models and metaphors of livelihood|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=1986|id=|isbn = 978-0-7102-0560-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, people's own conceptualizations or mental maps of economics and its various aspects. His description of a peasant community in [[Panama]] reveals that the locals did not engage in exchange with each other in order to make a profit but rather viewed it as an "exchange of equivalents", with the exchange value of a good being defined by the expenses spent on producing it. Only outside merchants made profits in their dealings with the community; it was a complete mystery to the locals how they managed to do so.
{{rquote|right|Gaining a livelihood might be modelled as a causal and instrumental act, as a natural and inevitable sequence, as a result of supernatural dispositions or as a combination of all these.| Gudeman 1986:47&lt;ref name="gudeman"/&gt;}}

Gudeman also criticizes the substantivist position for imposing their universal model of economics on preindustrial societies and so making the same mistake as the formalists. While conceding that substantivism rightly emphasises the significance of social institutions in economic processes, Gudeman considers any deductive universal model, be it formalist, substantivist or [[Marxism|Marxist]], to be ethnocentric and tautological. In his view they all model [[wiktionary:Relationship|relationship]]s as mechanistic processes by taking the logic of natural science based on the [[Nature|material world]] and applying it to the [[human]] [[world]]. Rather than to "arrogate to themselves a privileged right to model the economies of their subjects", anthropologists should seek to understand and interpret local models (1986:38).&lt;ref name="gudeman"/&gt; Such local models may differ radically from their Western counterparts. For example, the [[Iban people|Iban]] use only hand [[knives]] to [[harvest]] rice. Although the use of [[sickle]]s could speed up the harvesting process, they believe that this may cause the spirit of the rice to flee, and their desire to prevent that outcome is greater than their desire to economize the harvesting process.

Gudeman brings post-modern [[cultural relativism]] to its logical conclusion. Generally speaking, however, culturalism can also be seen as an extension of the substantivist view, with a stronger emphasis on cultural constructivism, a more detailed account of local understandings and [[metaphor]]s of economic concepts, and a greater focus on socio-cultural dynamics than the latter ([[cf.]] Hann, 2000).&lt;ref name="hann"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hann, C. M.|title=Social Anthropology|location=London|publisher=Teach Yourself|year=2000|id=|isbn = 978-0-340-72482-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturalists tend to be both less taxonomic and more culturally relativistic in their descriptions while critically reflecting on the power relationship between the ethnographer (or 'modeller') and the subjects of his or her research. While substantivists generally focus on institutions as their unit of analysis, culturalists lean towards detailed and comprehensive analyses of particular local communities. Both views agree in rejecting the formalist assumption that all human behaviour can be explained in terms of rational decision-making and utility maximisation.

Culturalism can be criticized from various perspectives. Marxists argue that culturalists are too idealistic in their notion of the social construction of [[reality]] and too weak in their analysis of external (i.e. material) constraints on individuals that affect their livelihood choices. If, as Gudeman argues, local models cannot be held against a universal standard, then they cannot be related to hegemonic ideologies propagated by the powerful, which serve to neutralise resistance. This is further complicated by the fact that in an age of [[globalization]] most cultures are being integrated into the global capitalist system and are influenced to conform to Western ways of thinking and acting. Local and global discourses are mixing, and the distinctions between the two are beginning to blur. Even though people will retain aspects of their existing worldviews, universal models can be used to study the dynamics of their integration into the rest of the world.

===Householding===

===Entrepreneurs in "imperfect markets"===
Inspired by a collection on "''Trade and Market in the early Empires''" edited by Karl Polanyi, the substantivists conducted a wide comparative study of market behavior in traditional societies where such markets were [[embeddedness|embedded]] in kinship, religion and politics. They thus remained focused on the social and cultural processes that shaped markets, rather than on the individual focused study of economizing behavior found in economic analysis. [[George Dalton (economist)|George Dalton]] and [[Paul Bohannan|Paul Bohannon]], for example, published a collection on markets in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George Dalton|first=Paul Bohannon|title=Markets in Africa|year=1962|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Pedlars and Princes: Social Development and Economic Change in Two Indonesian Towns'' by Clifford Geertz compared the entrepreneurial cultures of Islamic Java with Hinduized Bali in the post-colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Pedlars and Princes: Social Development and Economic Change in Two Indonesian Towns|year=1963|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Java, trade was in the hands of pious Muslims, whereas in Bali, larger enterprises were organized by aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wertheim|first=W.F.|title=Peasants, Peddlers and Princes in Indonesia: A Review Article|journal=Pacific Affairs|year=1964|volume=37|issue=3|pages=307–11|doi=10.2307/2754978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this literature was refocused on "informal economies", those market activities lying on the periphery of legal markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halperin|first=Rhoda H.|title=Cultural Economies: Past and Present|year=1988|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Modernization theory]] of development had led economists in the 1950s and 1960s to expect that traditional forms of work and production would disappear in developing countries. Anthropologists found, however, that the sector had not only persisted, but expanded in new and unexpected ways. In accepting that these forms of productions were there to stay, scholars began using the term informal sector, which is credited to the British anthropologist [[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]] in a study on [[Ghana]] in 1973. This literature focuses on the "invisible work" done by those who fall outside the formal production process, such as the production of clothing by domestic workers, or those who are bound labourers in sweatshops. As these studies have shifted to the informal sector of western economies, the field has been dominated by those taking a [[Political economy in anthropology|political economy]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Narotzky|first=Susana|title=New Directions in Economic Anthropoogy|year=1997|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|pages=35–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Substantivism and capitalism as a cultural system===
While many anthropologists like Gudeman were concerned with peasant economic behaviour, others turned to the analysis of market societies. Economic Sociologist [[Mark Granovetter]] provided a new research paradigm (neo-substantivism) for these researchers. Granovetter argued that the [[neo-liberal]] view of economic action which separated economics from society and culture promoted an 'undersocialized account' that atomises human behavior. Similarly, he argued, substantivists had an "over-socialized" view of economic actors, refusing to see the ways that rational choice could influence the ways they acted in traditional, "embedded" social roles. Neo-Substantivism overlaps with [[institutional economics|'old']] and especially [[new institutional economics]].

{{Quotation|Actors do not behave or decide as atoms outside a social context, nor do they adhere slavishly to a script written for them by the particular intersection of social categories that they happen to occupy. Their attempts at purposive action are instead embedded in concrete, ongoing systems of social relations.&lt;ref name="granovetter"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Granovetter, M.|title=Economic action and social structure: the problem of embeddedness|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=91|pages=487|year=1985|id=|doi=10.1086/228311|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Granovetter applied the concept of [[embeddedness]] to market societies, demonstrating that even their, "rational" economic exchanges are influenced by pre-existing social ties.&lt;ref name="granovetter"/&gt;  In his study of ethnic Chinese [[business network]]s in [[Indonesia]], [[Granovetter]] found individual's economic agency embedded in networks of strong personal relations. In processes of clientelization the cultivation of personal relationships between traders and customers assumes an equal or higher importance than the economic transactions involved. Economic exchanges are not carried out between strangers but rather by individuals involved in long-term continuing relationships.

== Money and finance==
[[File:ClientCardSample.png|thumb|180px|left|A sample picture of a fictional ATM card. The largest part of the world's money exists only as accounting numbers which are transferred between financial computers.  Various plastic cards and other devices give individual consumers the power to electronically transfer such money to and from their bank accounts, without the use of currency.]]

===Special and general purpose of money===
Early anthropologists of the substantivist school were struck by the number of "special purpose monies," like [[wampum]] and [[shell money]], that they encountered. These special purpose monies were used to facilitate trade, but were not the "universal" money of market-based economies. Universal money served five functions:
* Medium of exchange: they facilitated trade
* Unit of account: they are an abstract measure of value or worth
* Store of value: they allow wealth to be preserved over time
* Standard of deferred payment: they are a measure of debt
* Means of payment: they can be used in non-market situations to pay debts (like taxes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalton|first=George|title=Economic Anthropology and Development: Essays on Tribal and Peasant Economies|year=1971|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|pages=167–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special purpose monies, in contrast, were frequently restricted in their use; they might be limited to a specific exchange sphere such as the brass rods used by the Tiv of Nigeria in the early twentieth century (see "[[spheres of exchange]]" above). Most of this early work documented the effects of universal money on these special purpose monies. Universal money frequently weakened the boundaries between exchange spheres. Others have pointed out, however, how alternative currencies such as [[Ithaca Hours|Ithaca HOURS]] in New York state are used to create new community based spheres of exchange in western market economies by fostering barter.&lt;ref name="Maurer 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurer|first=Bill|title=Mutual Life, Limited: Islamic Banking, Alternative Currencies, Lateral Reason|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herrmann|first=Gretchen|title=Special Money: Ithaca Hours and Garage Sales|journal=Ethnology|year=2006|volume=45|issue=2|pages=125–41|doi=10.2307/4617570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this work was updated and retheorized in the edited collection: ''Money and Modernity: State and Local Currencies in Melanesia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akin, David|first=Robbins, Joel|title=Money and Modernity: State and Local Currencies in Melanesia|year=1999|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second collection, ''Money and the morality of exchange'' examined how "general purpose money" could be transformed into a "special purpose money" - how money could be "socialized" and stripped of its moral danger so that it abets domestic economies free of market demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parry, J.|first=Bloch, M.|title=Money and the morality of exchange|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Reddy undertook the same kind of analysis of the meanings of monetary exchange in terms of the growth of Liberalism in early modern Europe. Reddy critiques what he calls the "Liberal illusion" that developed in this period, that money is a universal equivalent and a principle of liberation. He underscores the different values and meanings that money has for those of different classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reddy|first=William M.|title=Money and liberty in modern Europe: a critique of historical understanding|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barter===
{{main|Barter}}

David Graeber argues that the inefficiencies of barter in archaic society has been used by economists since [[Adam Smith]] to explain the emergence of money, the economy, and hence the discipline of economics itself.&lt;ref name="Graeber-p21-41"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: the first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=New York|pages=21–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Economists of the contemporary orthodoxy... propose an evolutionary development of economies which places barter, as a 'natural' human characteristic, at the most primitive stage, to be superseded by monetary exchange as soon as people become aware of the latter's greater efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=49|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, extensive investigation since then has established that "No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of money; all available ethnography suggests that there never has been such a thing. But there are economies today which are nevertheless ''dominated'' by barter."&lt;ref name="Humphrey-p48"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=48|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists have argued "that when something resembling barter ''does'' occur in stateless societies it is almost always between strangers, people who would otherwise be enemies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barter occurred between strangers, not fellow villagers, and hence cannot be used to naturalistically explain the origin of money without the state. Since most people engaged in trade knew each other, exchange was fostered through the extension of credit.&lt;ref name="Humphrey-p48" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: the first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=New York|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel Mauss, author of '[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]', argued that the first economic contracts were to ''not'' act in one's economic self-interest, and that before money, exchange was fostered through the processes of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and [[redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]], not barter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyday exchange relations  in such societies are characterized by generalized reciprocity, or a non-calculative familial "communism" where each takes according to their needs, and gives as they have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: The First 5,000 Years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=94–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anthropologists have questioned whether barter is typically between "total" strangers, a form of barter known as "[[silent trade]]".  However, Benjamin Orlove has shown that barter occurs through "silent trade" (between strangers), but also in commercial markets as well. "Because barter is a difficult way of conducting trade, it will occur only where there are strong institutional constraints on the use of money or where the barter symbolically denotes a special social relationship and is used in well-defined conditions. To sum up, multipurpose money in markets is like lubrication for machines - necessary for the most efficient function, but not necessary for the existence of the market itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Anthropology|year=1989|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|pages=179|author=Plattner, Stuart|authorlink=Markets and Marketplaces|editor=Plattner, Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barter may occur in commercial economies, usually during periods of monetary crisis. During such a crisis, currency may be in short supply, or highly devalued through hyperinflation. In such cases, money ceases to be the universal [[medium of exchange]] or standard of value. Money may be in such short supply that it becomes an item of barter itself rather than the means of exchange. Barter may also occur when people cannot afford to keep money (as when hyperinflation quickly devalues it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=52|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Money as commodity fetish ===
[[File:McKinley Prosperity.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Metal money fetishism: A political poster shows [[gold coin]] as the basis of prosperity. (ca. 1896)]]
Anthropologists have analyzed these cultural situations where universal money is being introduced as a means of revealing the underlying cultural assumptions about money that market based societies have internalized. Michael Taussig, for example, examined the reactions of peasant farmers in Colombia as they struggled to understand how money could make interest. Taussig highlights that we have [[Commodity fetishism|fetishized]] money. We view money as an active agent, capable of doing things, of growth. In viewing money as an active agent, we obscure the social relationships that actually give money its power. The Colombian peasants, seeking to explain how money could bear interest, turned to folk beliefs like the "baptism of money" to explain how money could grow. Dishonest individuals would have money baptized, which would then become an active agent; whenever used to buy goods, it would escape the till and return to its owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taussig|first=Michael|title=The genesis of capitalism amongst a South American peasantry: Devil's labor and the baptism of money|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=1977|volume=19|issue=2|pages=130–155|doi=10.1017/S0010417500008586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schrauwers similarly examines a situation where paper money was introduced for the first time, in early nineteenth century Ontario, Canada. Paper money, or bank notes, were not a store of wealth; they were an I.O.U., a "promisory note," a fetish of debt. Banks in the era had limited capital. They didn't loan that capital. Instead, they issued paper notes promising to pay that amount should the note be presented in their office. Since these notes stayed in circulation for lengthy periods, banks had little fear they would have to pay, and so issued many more notes than they could redeem, and charged interest on all of them. Utilizing Bourdieu's concept of symbolic capital, Schrauwers examines the way that elite social status was converted into economic capital (the bank note). The bank note's value depended entirely on the public's perceptions that it could be redeemed, and that perception was based entirely on the social status of the bank's shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title="Money bound you - money shall loose you": Micro-credit, Social Capital, and the meaning of money in Upper Canada|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=2011|volume=53|issue=2|pages=314–343|doi=10.1017/S0010417511000077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banking, finance and the stock market===

More recent work has focused on finance capital and stock markets. Anna Tsing for example, analyzed the "[[Bre-X]] stock scandal" in Canada and Indonesia in terms of "The economy of appearances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsing|first=Anna L.|title=Friction: An Ethnography of Global Connection|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Hertz, in contrast, looked at the development of stock markets in Shanghai, China, and the particular ways in which this free market was embedded in local political and cultural realities; markets do not operate in the same manner in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertz|first=Ellen|title=The Trading Crowd: An Ethnography of the Shanghai Stock Market|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar study was done by [[Karen Ho]] on Wall Street, in the midst of the financial crisis of 2008. Her book, ''Liquidated: an ethnography of Wall Street'', provides an insiders view of how "market rationality" works, and how it is embedded in particular kinds of social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ho|first=Karen|title=Liquidated: an ethnography of Wall Street|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Maurer]] has examined how Islamic bankers who are seeking to avoid religiously proscribed interest payments have remade money and finance in Indonesia. His book, ''Mutual Life, Limited'', compares these Islamic attempts to remake the basis of money to local currency systems in the United States, such as "Ithaca Hours." In doing so, he questions what it is that gives money its value.&lt;ref name="Maurer 2005"/&gt; This same question of what gives money its value is also addressed in David Graeber's book ''Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=Basingstoke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Carrier]] has extended the cultural economic and neo-substantivist position by applying their methods to the "science of economics" as a cultural practice. He has edited two collection that examine "free market" ideologies, comparing them to the culturally embedded economic practices they purport to describe.  The edited collection, "Meanings of the market: the Free Market in Western Culture",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carrier|first=James|title=Meanings of the market: the Free Market in Western Culture|year=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  examined the use of market models in policy-making in the United States. A second edited collection "Virtualism: A New Political Economy," examined the cultural and social effects on western nations forced to adhere to abstract models of the free market: "Economic models are no longer measured against the world they seek to describe, but instead the world is measured against them, found wanting and made to conform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carrier|first=James|title=Virtualism: A New Political Economy|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumption studies==

===Pierre Bourdieu on ''Distinction''===

==The anthropology of corporate capitalism==

===Symbolic and economic capital===

Similar insights were developed by [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who also rejected the arguments of the [[New institutional economics|new institutional economists]]. While these economists attempted to incorporate culture in their models, they did so by arguing that non-market "tradition" was the product of rational maximizing action in the market (i.e., to show they are the solution to an economic problem, rather than having deep cultural roots). Bourdieu argued strongly against what he called RAT (Rational Action Theory) theory, arguing that any actor, when asked for an explanation for their behaviour will provide a rational post hoc answer, but that excuse does not in fact guide the individual in the act. Driving a car is an example; individuals do so out of an acquired "instinct", obeying the rules of the road without actually focusing upon them. Bourdieu utilized an alternate model, which emphasized how "economic capital" could be translated into "symbolic capital" and vice versa. For example, in traditional Mexican villages, those of wealth would be called upon to fulfill "cargo offices" in the church, and host feasts in honour of the saints. These offices used up their economic capital, but in so doing, it was translated into status (symbolic capital) in the traditional role. This symbolic capital could, in turn, be used to draw customers in the marketplace because of a reputation for honesty and selflessness. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Actor-Network theory===
[[Michel Callon]] has spearheaded the movement of applying ANT approaches to study economic life (notably economic markets). This body of work interrogates the interrelation between the economy and economics, highlighting the ways in which economics (and economics-inspired disciplines such as marketing) shapes the economy (see Callon, 1998 and 2005).

===Ethnographies of the corporation===
Corporations are increasingly hiring anthropologists as employees and consultants, leading to an increasingly critical appraisal about the organizational forms of post-modern capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cefkin|first=Melissa|title=Ethnography and the Corporate Encounter|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aihwa Ong's ''Spirits of resistance and capitalist discipline: factory women in Malaysia'' (1987) was pathbreaking in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ong|first=Aihwa|title=Spirits of resistance and capitalist discipline: factory women in Malaysia|year=1987|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work inspired a generation of anthropologists who have examined the incorporation of women within corporate economies, especially in the new "Free trade zones" of the newly industrializing third world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Suzanne|title=The domestication of desire: women, wealth, and modernity in Java|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Carla|title=High tech and high heels in the gobal economy: women, work, and pink-collar identities in the Caribbean|year=2000|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham NC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have focused on the former industrialized (now rust-belt) economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mollona|first=Massimiliano|title=Made in Sheffield. An ethnography of industrial work and politics|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daromir Rudnyckyj has analyzed how neo-liberal economic discourses have been utilized by Indonesian Muslims operating the Krakatau Steel Company to create a "spiritual economy" conducive to globalization while enhancing the Islamic piety of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudnyckyj|first=Daromir|title=Spiritual Economies: Islam, Globalization and the Afterlife of Development|year=2010|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George E. Marcus|George Marcus]] has called for anthropologists to "study up" and to focus on corporate elites, and has edited a series called ''Late Editions: Cultural Studies for the End of the Century.''

The current national '''emblem of [[Sudan]]''' was adopted in 1985. It shows a [[secretary bird]] bearing a shield from the time of [[Muhammad Ahmad]], the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]] who [[History of Mahdist Sudan|briefly ruled Sudan]] in the 19th century.

Two scrolls are placed on the arms; the upper one displays the [[national motto]], ''An-nasr lanā'' النصر لنا ("Victory is ours"), and the lower one displays the title of the state, جمهورية السودان ''Jumhūriyat as-Sūdān'' ("Republic of the Sudan").

The coat of arms is also the Presidential seal and is found in gold on the flag of the [[President of Sudan]] and on the vehicles carrying the President and at his residence.

The secretary bird was chosen as a distinctively Sudanese and indigenous variant of the "[[Eagle of Saladin (heraldry)#Arab heraldry|Eagle of Saladin]]" and "[[Hawk of Quraish]]" seen in the emblems of some Arab states, and associated with [[Arab nationalism]] (see [[Coat of arms of Egypt]], etc.).

==Former emblem==
The former state emblem was in use from independence in 1956 to 1970, when the current emblem was adopted. It consisted of a [[rhinoceros]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010712230721/http://www.christian-siemer.de/wappen/afrika/sudan.htm WAPPENLEXIKON - SUDAN] (archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt; enclosed by two palm-trees and olive branches, with the name of the state, جمهورية السودان ''Jumhūriyat as-Sūdān'' ("Republic of the Sudan"), displayed below.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Flag Book in Color'' by Christian Fogd Pedersen (1971), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental adult education''' is recognized as a "hybrid outgrowth of the [[environmental movement]] and [[adult education]], combining an [[ecology|ecological]] orientation with a learning paradigm to provide a vigorous educational approach to environmental concerns" (Sumner, 2003).

In laymen's terms, environmental adult education refers to efforts in teaching environmental issues and how individuals and businesses can manage or change their lifestyles and their [[ecosystem]]s in order to achieve sustainable existence. The overarching goal of this field of study is to educate global citizens in order for them to gain sustainable lives within their respective societies. The content could also include [[Environmental justice|ecological justice]], integrating social concerns such as poverty, race, gender, and sexual orientation, among others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Adult Education|last=English|first=Leona|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=9780230201712|location=New York|pages=218-219}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is demonstrated in the impact of the excesses of global capitalism and its insatiable need for resources on people such as the polarization of power and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecojustice Adult Education|last=Dentith|first=Audrey|last2=Griswold|first2=Wendy|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2017|isbn=9781119383833|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Environmental adult education is a relatively new and unique field of study and practice. Using a community-based method, educators listen and respect the input of learners and all participants are considered essential.&lt;ref name=Haugen/&gt;

Although for more than a century, environmental and conservation organizations taught adults environmental education with very little structure, it has actually evolved during the last thirty years.

The [[United States]] was one of the first countries to officially recognize environmental education. During a joint House–Senate session in 1968, Congress acknowledged the importance of environmental education, and in 1970 passed the [[Environmental Education Act]], which established the [[Office of Environmental Education]].&lt;ref&gt;American Geological Institute 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, this framework began to emerge in Asia and Latin America, where it is considered a stream of adult education and sometimes referred to as environmental popular education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The United Nations, for its part, began integrating the concept of environmental sustainability to the [[Education For All|Education for All]] initiative, which is a set of UN policies with a goal of meeting learning needs of all people, as well as the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millenium Development Goals (MDGs)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Adult and Continuing Education|last=Kasworm|first=Carol|last2=Rose|first2=Amy|last3=Ross-Gordon|first3=Jovita|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412960502|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the UN-organized Earth Summit in 1992, prompted the [[International Council for Adult Education]] to develop the Learning for Environmental Action Programme (LEAP) which took the initiative of facilitating the dialogue that connect environmental issues and adult learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Timeline===
*Mid-1970s: EAE recognized as distinct field of study
*Late 1980s: EAE focus on learner experience
*Late 1990s, Early 2000: Focus shifted to how to teach EAE
*1997: United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) hosted conference on adult education with EAE being one of the 33 workshops presented

== Earlier environmental education initiatives ==
According to the UNESCO Web site,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} in 1968 it organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development, now known as "sustainable development". In the following years, UNESCO and the [[United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP) initiated three major declarations that defined environmental education. Those included:
*1972: [[Stockholm Declaration]]. This document included seven proclamations and 26 principles "to inspire and guide the peoples of the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment."
*1975: [[Belgrade Charter]]. The product of the International Workshop on Environmental Education, this charter built upon the Stockholm Declaration by adding goals, objectives and principles for environmental education programs.
*1977: [[Tbilisi Declaration]]. This document updated and clarified the Stockholm Declaration and the Belgrade Charter by including new goals, objectives, characteristics, and guiding principles of environmental education.

== Methods ==

Educators in this field of study consider environmental problems with a [[holistic]] approach that combines social, political and environmental concerns into community dilemmas.&lt;ref name=Haugen&gt;Haugen 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Participatory methods allow learners to make connections between social issues and environmental problems. This connection allows adult learners to understand the core causes of major environmental issues and the resulting social inequalities. This method also allows educators to stress the importance of instilling environmental awareness so that learners do not forget their relationship with the natural world.

To summarize the methods of adult environmental education training, environmental adult educators strive to instil learners with: 
* a knowledge of environmental problems and their causes
* the skills to engage in social activism to combat those problems
* the attitude of respect and connection to the natural world
* a desire to change current practices to protect the Earth

Environmental adult education generally takes place in a nonformal education setting. This means that the organized learning can take place in many forms including vocational education, literacy education and on the job training.&lt;ref name=Haugen/&gt; There are, however, examples of formal learning such as the degree programs and courses in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustainability in Higher Education: Stories and Strategies for Transformation|last=Barlett|first=Peggy|last2=Chase|first2=Geoffrey|publisher=MIT Press|year=2013|isbn=9780262019491|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could also be a combination of these methods of environmental educational program delivery as demonstrated in the case of [[El Salvador]]'s National Environmental Education Strategy, which covered all aspect of education via a private-public partnership. The government - through its Ministry of Education - integrated environmental education in schools, including tertiary education institutions, while partners such as media outfits deliver meaningful environmental concepts to targeted audiences and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education and Sustainability: Responding to the Global Challenge|last=Tilbury|first=Daniella|last2=Stevenson|first2=Robert|last3=Fien|first3=John|last4=Schreuder|first4=Danie|publisher=IUCN|year=2002|isbn=2831706238|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs and organizations that encourage adult environmental education ==
{{globalize|date=February 2011}}

* Conservation education and governmental agencies such as the [[Forestry Service]] and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) were established to educate adults in broad areas of the environment.
* The [[Nature Conservancy]], originally the Ecological Society of America, was formed in 1915 with the missions of supporting ecologists and preserving natural ecosystems.
* The [[4-H Organization]] was also established to reach adults by educating youth in areas of new agricultural technology and environmental awareness.
*The [[Peace Corps]], established in 1961, has worked to incorporate adult environmental education and conservation practices into its international programming. Volunteers assist in:
* Environmental education
* [[Recycling]]
* [[Wildlife protection]]
* [[Park management]]
* Alleviating water-borne diseases
* Providing potable water
* [[Project WET]] (Water Education for Teachers) is a nonprofit water education program and publisher. This program "promotes awareness, appreciation, knowledge and stewardship of water resources through the dissemination of classroom-ready teaching aids and the establishment of internationally sponsored Project WET programs." Committed to global water education that is implemented at the community level, the mission of Project WET is to reach children, parents, educators, and communities of the world with water education.&lt;ref&gt;Project WET&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Project WILD]] is a conservation and environmental education program for educators of students in kindergarten through high school. Project WILD addresses the need for human beings to develop as responsible citizens of the planet. It is based on the belief that young adults and educators have an interest in learning about the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Project WILD&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Project Learning Tree]], a program of the American Forest Foundation, is an award winning, multi-disciplinary environmental education program for educators and students in PreK–Grade 12.
* ''[[Gobar Times]]'' a monthly environmental education magazine for the young adult.

'''''Gassenhauer nach Hans Neusiedler (1536)''''', commonly known as '''''Gassenhauer'''''&lt;ref&gt;The title is a colloquial archaic [[German language|German]] word originally meaning lively pieces of dance music, and later used for popular songs like operetta schlager during the early record era.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-de|ˈɡasn̩ˌhaʊ̯ɐ|pron}}), is a short piece from [[Carl Orff]]'s [[Schulwerk]]. As the full title indicates, it is either an arrangement of, or inspired by, a much older work by the [[lutenist]] [[Hans Neusidler]] from 1536. It (along with several other pieces) is in fact credited to Orff's longtime collaborator, [[Gunild Keetman]], on at least one recent release of the Schulwerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orff-Schulwerk, Volume 1: Musica Poetica, Celestial Harmonies 13104-2|url=http://harmonies.com/releases/13104.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many other pieces from the [[Schulwerk]], it has been used multiple times on television, radio, music, and in films, including the films ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' (1973), ''[[True Romance]]'' (1993) (in a re-worked version by [[Hans Zimmer]]), ''[[Ratcatcher (film)|Ratcatcher]]'' (1999), ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000), ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'' (2003), and, most recently, Michael Moore's ''[[Capitalism: A Love Story]]'' (2009) and ''[[The Simpsons]]''′ 22nd-season episode "[[The Scorpion's Tale]]" (2011). The piece was used as the theme music for an afternoon radio program also titled ''Gassenhauer'' on the classical music station [[WCLV]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Mark|title=Street Song / Gassenhauer: A 500 Year History|journal=Evergreen American Orff-Schulwerk Association Chapter Newsletter|year=2010|volume=34|issue=1|page=3|url=http://www.evergreenorffchapter.com/eocnews341.pdf|accessdate=June 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113202156/http://www.evergreenorffchapter.com/eocnews341.pdf|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece also has clear influences on the 1940s golden-age Argentine Tango ''vals Caballero de la luna'' by instrumentalist Enrique Rodríguez&lt;ref&gt;https://tango.info/Z0000635824.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''genetically modified organism''' ('''GMO''') is any organism whose [[gene]]tic material has been altered using [[genetic engineering]] techniques (i.e., a genetically ''engineered'' organism). GMOs are used to produce many medications and [[genetically modified food]]s and are widely used in scientific research and the production of other goods. The term GMO is very close to the [[Technical terminology|technical legal term]], 'living modified organism', defined in the [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], which regulates international trade in living GMOs (specifically, "any living organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology").

A more specifically defined type of GMO is a "transgenic organism." This is an organism whose genetic makeup has been altered by the addition of genetic material from an unrelated organism. This should not be confused with the more general way in which "GMO" is used to classify genetically altered organisms, as typically GMOs are organisms whose genetic makeup has been altered without the addition of genetic material from an unrelated organism.

The first [[genetically modified mouse]] was created in 1974 by [[Rudolf Jaenisch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.71.4.1250|author1=Jaenisch, R.  |author2=Mintz, B.|year=1974|title=Simian virus 40 DNA sequences in DNA of healthy adult mice derived from preimplantation blastocysts injected with viral DNA|journal=Proc.

There are a number of techniques available for [[Gene delivery|inserting the isolated gene into the host genome]]. Bacteria can be induced to take up foreign DNA by being exposed to certain stresses (e.g. [[heat shock|thermal]] or electric shock).

Traditionally the new genetic material was inserted randomly within the host genome. [[Gene targeting]] techniques, which creates [[double-strand breaks|double-stranded breaks]] and takes advantage on the cells natural [[homologous recombination]] repair systems, have been developed to target insertion to exact [[Locus (genetics)|locations]].

[[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] made the first genetically modified organism in 1973.

There are a wide variety of organisms that have been genetically engineered, from animals to plants and microorganisms. Genes have been transferred [[Cisgenesis|within the same species]], across species and even across [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. New genes can be introduced, or [[Endogenous|endogenous genes]] can be enhanced, altered or [[Gene knockout|knocked out]].

Genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms can be added to a [[plasmid]] and inserted into bacteria for storage and modification. Bacteria are cheap, easy to grow, [[Clone (cell biology)|clonal]], multiply quickly, are relatively easy to transform, and can be stored at &amp;minus;80&amp;nbsp;°C almost indefinitely.

Bacteria have been used in the production of food for a long time, and specific strains have been developed and selected for that work on an [[Industry|industrial]] scale. They can be used to produce [[enzyme]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[Flavor|flavourings]], and other compounds used in food production. With the advent of genetic engineering, new genetic changes can easily be introduced into these bacteria. Most food-producing bacteria are [[lactic acid bacteria]], and this is where the majority of research into genetically engineering food-producing bacteria has gone. The bacteria can be modified to operate more efficiently, reduce toxic byproduct production, increase output, create improved compounds, and remove unnecessary [[Biological pathway|pathways]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|date=2016-01-01|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123849472003561|language=en|pages=211–216|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-384947-2.00356-1|title=Encyclopedia of Food and Health|last1=Kärenlampi|first1=S.O|last2=von Wright|first2=A.J|isbn=9780123849533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food products from genetically modified bacteria include [[alpha-amylase]], which converts starch to simple sugars, [[chymosin]], which clots milk protein for cheese making, and [[pectinesterase]], which improves fruit juice clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Panesar, Pamit ''et al.''

With greater understanding of the role that the [[Human microbiota|micobiome]] plays in human health, there is the potential to treat diseases by genetically altering the bacteria to, themselves, be therapeutic agents. Ideas include altering gut bacteria so they destroy harmful bacteria, or using bacteria to replace or increase deficient [[enzymes]] or proteins. One research focus is to modify ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', bacteria that naturally provide some protection against [[HIV]], with genes that will further enhance this protection. If the bacteria do not form [[Bacterial colony|colonies]] inside the patient, the person must repeatedly ingest the modified bacteria in order to get the required doses. Enabling the bacteria to form a colony could provide a more long-term solution, but could also raise safety concerns as interactions between bacteria and the human body are less well understood than with traditional drugs. There are concerns that [[horizontal gene transfer]] to other bacteria could have unknown effects. As of 2018 there are clinical trials underway testing the [[efficacy]] and safety of these treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=12 June 2018|title=Genetically modified bacteria enlisted in fight against disease|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05476-4|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=558|issue=7711|pages=497–498|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-05476-4|pmid=29946090|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over a century bacteria have been used in agriculture. Crops have been [[Inoculation|inoculated]] with [[Rhizobia]] (and more recently ''[[Azospirillum]]'') to increase their production or to allow them to be grown outside their original [[habitat]]. Application of ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) and other bacteria can help protect crops from insect infestation and plant diseases. With advances in genetic engineering, these bacteria have been manipulated for increased efficiency and expanded host range. Markers have also been added to aid in tracing the spread of the bacteria. The bacteria that naturally colonise certain crops have also been modified, in some cases to express the Bt genes responsible for pest resistance. ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' strains of bacteria cause frost damage by [[Nucleation|nucleating]] water into [[ice crystals]] around themselves. This led to the development of [[ice-minus bacteria]], that have the ice-forming genes removed. When applied to crops they can compete with the ice-plus bacteria and confer some frost resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amarger|first=N|date=1 November 2002|title=Genetically modified bacteria in agriculture|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0300908402000354|journal=Biochimie|volume=84|issue=11|pages=1061–1072|doi=10.1016/s0300-9084(02)00035-4|issn=0300-9084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Virus ====
{{Main|Genetically modified virus}}
Viruses are often modified so they can be used as [[Viral vector|vectors]] for inserting genetic information into other organisms. This process is called [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] and if successful the recipient of the introduced DNA becomes a GMO. 

In 2017 researchers genetically modified a virus to express spinach [[defensin]] proteins. The virus was injected into orange trees to combat [[citrus greening disease]] that had reduced orange production 70% since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/04/save-floridas-famous-oranges-scientists-race-weaponize-virus/|title=Florida’s Orange Trees Are Dying, But a Weaponized Virus Could Save Them|last=Molteni|first=Megan|date=2017-04-12|work=Wired|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
{{Main|Genetically modified plant}}[[File:Btcornafrica.jpg|thumb | Kenyans examining insect-resistant transgenic [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bt]] corn]]
Transgenic plants have been engineered for scientific research, to create new colours in plants, and to create different crops.

In research, plants are engineered to help discover the functions of certain genes. One way to do this is to [[Gene knockout|knock out]] the gene of interest and see what [[phenotype]] develops. Another strategy is to attach the gene to a strong [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and see what happens when it is over expressed. A common technique used to find out where the gene is expressed is to attach it to [[GUS reporter system|GUS]] or a similar [[reporter gene]] that allows visualisation of the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=GUS fusions: beta-glucuronidase as a sensitive and versatile gene fusion marker in higher plants|author=Jefferson R.

====Crops====

{{Main|Genetically modified crops}}

Genetically modified crops (GM crops, or biotech crops) are plants used in [[agriculture]], the [[DNA]] of which has been modified using [[genetic engineering]] techniques.  In most cases the aim is to introduce a new [[trait (biology)|trait]] to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species.  Examples in food crops include resistance to certain pests, diseases, or environmental conditions, reduction of spoilage, or resistance to chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a [[herbicide]]), or improving the nutrient profile of the crop.  Examples in non-food crops include production of [[Plant manufactured pharmaceuticals|pharmaceutical agents]], [[biofuels]], and other industrially useful goods, as well as for [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref name="James2013"&gt;ISAAA 2013 Annual Report [http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/46/executivesummary/ Executive Summary, Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2013] ISAAA Brief 46-2013, Retrieved 6 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers have widely adopted GM technology. Between 1996 and 2013, the total surface area of land cultivated with GM crops increased by a factor of 100, from {{convert|17000|km2|acre|sp=us}} to 1,750,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (432 million acres).&lt;ref name="James2013" /&gt; 10% of the world's croplands were planted with GM crops in 2010.&lt;ref name="James2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/43/executivesummary/default.asp|title=ISAAA Brief 43, Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2011|last=James|first=C|year=2011|website=ISAAA Briefs|publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA)|location=Ithaca, New York|accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, by 2014, 94% of the planted area of soybeans, 96% of cotton and 93% of corn were genetically modified varieties.&lt;ref name="USDA2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us.aspx|title=USDA ERS – Adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops in the U.S|author1=Jorge Fernandez-Cornejo|author2=Seth James Wechsler|website=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, GM crops expanded rapidly in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. In 2013, approximately 18 million farmers grew 54% of worldwide GM crops in developing countries.&lt;ref name="James2013" /&gt;

Cisgenic plants

[[Cisgenesis]], sometimes also called intragenesis, is a product designation for a category of genetically engineered plants. A variety of classification schemes have been proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = K. M. | title = Transgenic organisms – time for conceptual diversification? | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–28 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12610561 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0303-227}}&lt;/ref&gt; that order genetically modified organisms based on the nature of introduced genotypical changes rather than the process of genetic engineering.

While some genetically modified plants are developed by the introduction of a gene originating from distant, sexually incompatible species into the host genome, cisgenic plants contain genes that have been isolated either directly from the host species or from sexually compatible species. The new genes are introduced using recombinant DNA methods and gene transfer. Some scientists hope that the approval process of cisgenic plants might be simpler than that of proper transgenics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Schouten | first1 = H.| last2 = Krens | first2 = F.| last3 = Jacobsen | first3 = E.| title = Cisgenic plants are similar to traditionally bred plants: international regulations for genetically modified organisms should be altered to exempt cisgenesis| journal = EMBO Reports| volume = 7| issue = 8| pages = 750–53| year = 2006| pmid = 16880817| pmc = 1525145| doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400769}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it remains to be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Prins, T. W. and Kok, E. J. (2010) [http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/clc/1952064 ''Food and feed safety aspects of cisgenic crop plant varieties''] Report 2010.001, Project number: 120.72.667.01, [[RIKILT]] – Institute of Food Safety, Netherlands. Retrieved 6 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conservation ====
Genetically modified organisms have been proposed to aid conservation of plant species threatened by extinction. Many trees face the threat of invasive plants and diseases, such as the [[emerald ash borer]] in North American and the fungal disease, [[Ceratocystis platani]], in European [[Platanus|plane trees]]. A suggested solution to increase the resilience of threatened tree species is to genetically modify individuals by transferring resistant genes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Jonathan M.|last2=Piovesan|first2=Gianluca|last3=Strauss|first3=Steve|last4=Brown|first4=Sandra|date=2002-08-01|title=The Case for Genetic Engineering of Native and Landscape Trees against Introduced Pests and Diseases|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=874–79|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00523.x|issn=1523-1739}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papaya]] trees are an example of a species that was successfully conserved using genetic modification. The [[papaya ringspot virus]] (PRSV) devastated papaya trees in Hawaii in the twentieth century until transgenic papaya plants were given pathogen-derived resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tripathi|first=Savarni|date=2007|title=Development of Genetically Engineered Resistant Papaya for papaya ringspot virus in a Timely Manner|url=|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology|volume=354|doi=10.1385/1-59259-966-4:197|pmid=17172756|pages=197–240|isbn=978-1-59259-966-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, genetic modification for conservation in plants remains mainly speculative and further experimentation is needed before the technique can be widely implemented. A main concern with using genetic modification for conservation purposes is that a transgenic species may no longer bear enough resemblance to the original species to truly claim that the original species is being conserved. Instead, the transgenic species may be genetically different enough to be considered a new species, thus diminishing the conservation worth of genetic modification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:ChimericMouseWithPups.jpg|thumb|Some [[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]], like the blotched mouse shown, are created through genetic modification techniques like [[gene targeting]].]]

Genetically modified mammals are an important category of genetically modified organisms.&lt;ref name="EFSA"&gt;EFSA (2012). [http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/genetically-modified-animals Genetically modified animals] Europe: EFSA&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph L. Brinster]] and Richard Palmiter developed the techniques responsible for transgenic mice, rats, rabbits, sheep, and pigs in the early 1980s, and established many of the first transgenic models of human disease, including the first carcinoma caused by a transgene. The process of genetically engineering animals is a slow, tedious, and expensive process. However, new technologies are making genetic modifications easier and more precise.&lt;ref name=Murray2010&gt;Murray, Joo (20). [http://www.brainwaving.com/2010/07/28/genetically-modified-animals Genetically modified animals]. Canada: Brainwaving&lt;/ref&gt;

The first transgenic (genetically modified) animal was produced by injecting DNA into mouse embryos then implanting the embryos in female mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.71.4.1250|author1=Jaenisch, R.  |author2=Mintz, B.|year=1974|title=Simian virus 40 DNA sequences in DNA of healthy adult mice derived from preimplantation blastocysts injected with viral DNA|journal=Proc.

Genetically modified animals currently being developed can be placed into six different broad classes based on the intended purpose of the genetic modification:
# to [[research]] human diseases (for example, to develop animal models for these diseases);
# to produce industrial or consumer products (fibres for multiple uses);
# to produce products intended for human therapeutic use (pharmaceutical products or tissue for implantation);
# to enrich or enhance the animals' interactions with humans (hypo-allergenic pets);
# to enhance production or food quality traits (faster growing fish, pigs that digest food more efficiently);
# to improve animal health (disease resistance)&lt;ref name="rudenko"&gt;Rudinko, Larisa (20). Guidance for industry. USA: Center for veterinary medicine [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/ucm113903.pdf/ Link.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetically modified (genetically engineered) animals are becoming more vital to the discovery and development of cures and treatments for many serious diseases. By altering the DNA or transferring DNA to an animal, we can develop certain proteins that may be used in medical treatment. Stable expressions of human proteins have been developed in many animals, including sheep, pigs, and rats. Human-alpha-1-antitrypsin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spencer|first=L|author2=Humphries, J |author3=Brantly, M.  |title=Antibody Response to Aerosolized Transgenic Human Alpha1-Antitrypsin| journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=12 May 2005|volume=352|issue=19|pages=2030–1|url=http://www.nejm.org|accessdate=28 April 2011|doi=10.1056/nejm200505123521923|pmid=15888711}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been tested in sheep and is used in treating humans with this deficiency and transgenic pigs with human-histo-compatibility have been studied in the hopes that the organs will be suitable for transplant with less chances of rejection.

Scientists have genetically engineered several organisms, including some mammals, to include [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP), first observed in the jellyfish, ''Aequorea victoria'' in 1962, for medical research purposes ([[Martin Chalfie|Chalfie]], [[Osamu Shimomura|Shimoura]], and [[Roger Y.

==== Conservation use ====
Genetically modified organisms have been used to conserve [[European rabbit|European wild rabbits]] in the Iberian peninsula and Australia. In both cases, the genetically modified organism used was a [[myxoma virus]], but for opposite purposes: to protect the endangered population in Europe with immunizations and to regulate the overabundant population in Australia with contraceptives.

In the Iberian peninsula, the European wild rabbit population has experienced a sharp decline from viral diseases and overhunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Sacramento|date=18 December 2007|title=Long-term decline of the European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in south-western Spain|url=|journal=Wildlife Research|volume=34|issue=8|pages=652|doi=10.1071/wr06142|pmid=|hdl=10261/59292}}&lt;/ref&gt; To protect the species from viral diseases, the myxoma virus was genetically modified to immunize the rabbits.

===Fish===
{{Main|Genetically modified fish}}
[[Genetically modified fish]] are used for scientific research and as pets, and are being considered for use as food and as aquatic pollution sensors.

GM fish are widely used in basic research in genetics and development. Two species of fish, [[zebrafish]] and [[Oryzias latipes|medaka]], are most commonly modified because they have optically clear [[Chorion (egg)|chorions]] (membranes in the egg), rapidly develop, and the 1-cell embryo is easy to see and microinject with transgenic DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, P. B., Ekker, S. E. and Essner, J. J. (2004) ''Applications of transposable elements in fish for transgenesis and functional genomics. Fish Development and Genetics'' (Z. Gong and V. Korzh, eds.)

==Regulation==
{{Main|Regulation of genetic engineering|}}
The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of [[genetic engineering]] technology and the development and release of genetically modified organisms (GMO), including [[genetically modified crops]] and [[genetically modified fish]]. There are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gaskell | first1 = G. | last2 = Bauer | first2 = M.

== Controversy ==
{{see also|Genetically modified food controversies}}

There is controversy over GMOs, especially with regard to their use in producing food. The dispute involves buyers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, nongovernmental organizations, and scientists. The key areas of controversy related to [[genetically modified food|GMO food]] are whether GM food should be labeled, the role of government regulators, the effect of GM crops on health and the environment, the effect on [[pesticide resistance]], the impact of GM crops for farmers, and the role of GM crops in feeding the world population. In 2014, sales of products that had been labeled as non-GMO grew 30 percent to $1.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/some-brands-are-labeling-products-gmo-free-even-if-they-dont-have-genes-180956421/|author=Smithonian|title=Some Brands Are Labeling Products "GMO-free" Even if They Don't Have Genes|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, it is worth mentioning that most of the studies demonstrating that GM foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained by conventional breeding, have been performed by biotechnology companies or associates, which are also responsible of commercializing these GM plants.

As with all novel foods, safety assessments in relation to GM foods must be made on a case-by-case basis.&lt;p&gt;Members of the GM jury project were briefed on various aspects of genetic modification by a diverse group of acknowledged experts in the relevant subjects. The GM jury reached the conclusion that the sale of GM foods currently available should be halted and the moratorium on commercial growth of GM crops should be continued. These conclusions were based on the precautionary principle and lack of evidence of any benefit. The Jury expressed concern over the impact of GM crops on farming, the environment, food safety and other potential health effects.&lt;p&gt;The Royal Society review (2002) concluded that the risks to human health associated with the use of specific viral DNA sequences in GM plants are negligible, and while calling for caution in the introduction of potential allergens into food crops, stressed the absence of evidence that commercially available GM foods cause clinical allergic manifestations. The BMA shares the view that that there is no robust evidence to prove that GM foods are unsafe but we endorse the call for further research and surveillance to provide convincing evidence of safety and benefit."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/|title=Public and Scientists' Views on Science and Society|first1=Cary|last1=Funk|first2=Lee|last2=Rainie|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=29 January 2015|accessdate=24 February 2016|quote=The largest differences between the public and the AAAS scientists are found in beliefs about the safety of eating genetically modified (GM) foods.

The Union of Concerned Scientists ("UCS"), an alliance of 50,000 citizens and scientists, has been another prominent voice on the issue.... As the pace of GM products entering the market increased in the 1990s, UCS became a vocal critic of what it saw as the agency’s collusion with industry and failure to fully take account of allergenicity and other safety issues."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greenpeace]] stated that risks have not been adequately identified and managed, and they have questioned the objectivity of regulatory authorities.

=== Biological patenting ===
The [[privatization]] of GM patenting is controversial because once [[Genetic sequence|genetic sequences]] are patented, farmers of GM foods are often forced to pay fees for their harvest. One example is from 1998, when [[RiceTec]] patented a GM version of [[Basmati Rice|basmati rice]]. Due to the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Uruguay Round|bans]] on "barriers" to trade, it was prohibited for GMOs to be labeled as such. Though RiceTec illegally accessed the Filipino genetic data bank that made their discoveries possible and therefore patentable, and the genes were copied from basmati rice already being grown in the Philippines, these GM seeds were sold throughout the region, and [[Filipinos|Filipino]] farmers were fined for harvesting a plant they had been growing for free previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p5cm|title=Making the World Safe for Capitalism: How Iraq Threatened the US Economic Empire and had to be Destroyed|last=Doran|first=Christopher|date=2012|publisher=Pluto Press|year=|isbn=9780745332222|location=|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2630">Graduate Enrollment Management (GEM) is an area of [[Enrollment management]] focused on graduate and professional education.

==History==
In 2013, the [[National Association of Graduate Admissions Professionals]] (NAGAP), changed its name to [[NAGAP]], The Association for Graduate Enrollment Management and in 2014 the term started to gain more traction, appearing in publications from both NAGAP and [[American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers]] (AACRAO)&lt;ref&gt;https://aacrao-web.s3.amazonaws.com/files/ERRrFKrUSgKa26VLIPL2_CUJ8903_WEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nagap.org/about-nagap|title=About NAGAP - NAGAP|website=www.nagap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
In 2014, NAGAP rolled out the following definition for graduate enrollment management: 
graduate enrollment management is a systematic approach to managing enrollment and the graduate student lifecycle from awareness to alumnus by integrating the core functions associated with the support of a graduate student. GEM represents a synthesis of traditional student support areas into seamless, cross-functional operations designed to integrated stakeholders, consolidate key assessment mechanisms, and bolster service levels.

A longer definition of GEM followed: 
graduate enrollment management (GEM) represents a comprehensive approach to the methods by which an institution recruits, admits, supports, retains, and graduates post-baccalaureate students in their respective degree programs.  This dynamic paradigm includes codependent functions working congruently to strategically manage overall enrollment levels and the student experience.  These include enrollment planning, marketing, recruitment and admissions, advisement/coaching, financial aid, student services, retention, and alumni relations.  

Regardless of staffing levels, integrated interdependence in GEM will ideally create an environment whereby a cross-trained professional from a graduate office is able to support a student throughout their time at the institution.  This approach creates an environment that sustains differentiated student experiences.

==Organizations==
A number of organizations focus on the field of GEM. Some of the more prominent organizations are:&lt;br&gt;
[[American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers]]&lt;br&gt;[[NAGAP]], the Association for Graduate Enrollment Management &lt;BR&gt;

[[National Association of Student Personnel Administrators]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53492">In [[road bicycle racing]], a '''Grand Tour''' is one of the three major [[Europe|European]] professional cycling [[stage (bicycle race)|stage]] races: [[Tour de France]], [[Giro d'Italia]] and [[Vuelta a España]]. Collectively they are termed the ''Grand Tours'', and all three races are similar in format being multi-week races with daily stages. They have a special status in the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] regulations: more points for the [[UCI World Tour]] are distributed in Grand Tours than in other races,&lt;ref name="uciprotour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uci.ch/mm/Document/News/Rulesandregulation/18/23/94/2-ROA-20170701-E_English.PDF |title=UCI Cycling regulations—Part 2: Road Races| page=64 |date=January 1, 2017 |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are the only stage races allowed to last longer than 14 days.&lt;ref name="ucirules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTkzNg&amp;ObjTypeCode=FILE&amp;type=FILE&amp;id=34028&amp;LangId=1 |title=UCI Cycling regulations |page=41 |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623174023/http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTkzNg&amp;ObjTypeCode=FILE&amp;type=FILE&amp;id=34028&amp;LangId=1 |archivedate=2011-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Giro d'Italia is generally run in May, the Tour de France in July, and the Vuelta a España in late August and September. The Vuelta was originally held in the spring, usually late April, with a few editions held in June in the 1940s. In 1995, however, the race moved to September to avoid direct competition with the Giro d'Italia, held in May.

The [[Tour de France]] is the oldest and most prestigious in terms of points accrued to racers of all three,&lt;ref name="uciprotour" /&gt;, and is the most widely attended annual sporting event in the world,&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.businessinsider.com/tour-de-france-2016-numbers-2016-6?r=US&amp;IR=T&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Giro d'Italia]] is generally seen as the second-most important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2009/giro09/?id=/features/2009/american_giro_stage_winners_may09 An American in Italy] cyclingnews.com, May 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=features/2007/abu_dhabi07 Million dollar, baby!] cyclingnews.com, January 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2008/vuelta08/?id=/features/2008/vuelta08_az1 Vuelta a España A-Z] cyclingnews.com, September 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Tour, the Giro and the [[UCI Road World Championships|Road World Cycling Championship]] make up the [[Triple Crown of Cycling]].

The three Grand Tours are events for men only, and no three week races exist on the women's road cycling circuit. The [[Giro Donne|Giro Rosa]], the ten stage Italian road race for women is the only race on the current women's circuit treated as broadly equivalent to a Grand Tour, although the [[Grande Boucle Féminine Internationale|defunct women's Tour de France]] was, in its time, given similar status.

== Description ==
In their current form, the Grand Tours are held over three consecutive weeks and typically include two rest days near the end of the first and second week. The stages are a mix of long massed start races (sometimes including mountain and hill [[climbing specialist|climbs]] and descents; others are flat stages favoring those with a [[cycling sprinter|sprint]] finish), as well as [[individual time trial|individual]] and [[team time trials]] and non-competitive exhibition and rest days. Unlike most one-day races, stages in the Grand Tours are generally under 200 kilometers in length.

Controversy often surrounds which teams are invited to the event. Typically, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (''International Cycling Union'') prefers top-rated professional teams to enter, while operators of the Grand Tours often want teams based in their country or those unlikely to cause controversy. From 2005 to 2007, organisers had to accept all [[UCI ProTour|ProTour]] teams, leaving only two wildcard teams per Tour. However, the [[Unibet.com Cycling Team|Unibet team]], a ProTour team normally guaranteed entry, was banned from the three Grand Tours due to gambling advertising laws. In 2008, following numerous doping scandals, some teams were refused entry to the Grand Tours: [[Astana Team|Astana]] did not compete at the [[2008 Tour de France]] and [[Team Columbia]] did not compete at the [[2008 Vuelta a España]]. Since 2011, under the UCI World Tour rules, all [[ProTour]] teams are guaranteed a place in all three events, and obliged to participate.

The prizes include the individual [[general classification]], the team classification, the [[King of the Mountains]], the [[points classification]], and often the best young rider classification, in addition to other less known classifications. The most contested ones are the individual general classification ([[general classification in the Tour de France]], [[general classification in the Giro d'Italia]], and [[general classification in the Vuelta a España]]) ; king of the mountains classification ([[mountains classification in the Tour de France]], [[mountains classification in the Giro d'Italia]], and [[mountains classification in the Vuelta a España]]); and points classification ([[points classification in the Tour de France]], [[points classification in the Giro d'Italia]], and [[points classification in the Vuelta a España]]). Only three riders have won all three in the same race: [[Eddy Merckx]] in the [[1968 Giro d'Italia]] and [[1969 Tour de France]], [[Tony Rominger]] in the [[1993 Vuelta a España]] and [[Laurent Jalabert]] in the [[1995 Vuelta a España]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclinghalloffame.com/riders/rider_bio.asp?rider_id=50 |title=Tony Rominger |publisher=Cycling Hall of Fame.com |date=1961-03-27 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rare for cyclists to ride all grand tours in the same year; in 2004, 474 cyclists started in at least one of the grand tours, 68 of them rode two Grand Tours and only two cyclists started in all three grand tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclismag.com/article.php?sid=917 |title=Doubler deux Grands Tours revient à la mode |date=19 March 2005 |author=Riche, Antoine |publisher=CyclisMag |language=French |accessdate=11 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120051406/http://cyclismag.com/article.php?sid=917 |archivedate=20 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not unusual for sprinters and their leadout men, who do not expect to complete each race, to start each of the Grand Tours and aim for stage wins before the most difficult stages occur. [[Alessandro Petacchi]] and [[Mark Cavendish]] started all three Grand Tours in 2010 and 2011, respectively, as did some of their preferred support riders. For both riders in both years, only the Tour de France was ridden to its conclusion.

Over the years, 32 riders have completed all three Grand Tours in one year. Of these, [[Adam Hansen]] is the only one to do so five times. [[Marino Lejarreta]] has done it four times, [[Bernardo Ruiz]] three times, [[Eduardo Chozas]] and [[Carlos Sastre]] twice each, and 27 more riders have achieved the feat once.

The only riders to have finished in the top 10 in each of the three tours during the same year are [[Raphaël Géminiani]] in 1955 and [[Gastone Nencini]] in 1957.

== UCI rules ==
For the [[UCI World Tour]], more points are given in grand tours than in other races; the winner of the Tour de France receives 200 points, and the winners of the Giro and Vuelta receive 170 points, while other races give 100 points at most.&lt;ref name="uciprotour" /&gt;
The grand tours have a special status for the length: they are allowed to last between 15 and 23 days.&lt;ref name="ucirules" /&gt;

However, in October 2012, he was [[Lance Armstrong doping case|stripped of all titles]] by the UCI due to his use of [[Doping in sport|performance-enhancing drugs]]. Organizers of the Tour de France announced that the winner's slot would remain empty in the record books, rather than transfer the win to the second-place finishers each year. However, in October 2014, the Tour de France resumed listing Armstrong as a previous winner of the tour, but with his name crossed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/tour-de-france-shorts-armstrong-is-back-an-alpine-etape-du-tour|title=Tour de France shorts: Armstrong is back, an Alpine Etape du Tour|work=Cyclingnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13581">In 1999 a private organisation, the [[Chatham Islands Note Corporation]], issued [[banknote]]s to celebrate the [[Chatham Islands]] being the first human inhabited land to enter the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Although this allegation sounds true, actually it isn't. This honour belongs to [[Antarctica]]. The first island to enter the third millennium would be the [[Millennium Island]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Banknotes such as these cannot be declared [[legal tender]], there is no obligation for anyone to accept the notes issued by the Chatham Island Note Corporation in any transaction. These notes were reported to have been accepted by merchants on the Chatham Islands, some of whom served as directors of the issuer.

The Chatham Islands Note Corporation was initially based in [[Christchurch]]. The agent for providing the notes to the [[numismatics|numismatic]] trade was Leon Morel, [[Fellow of the Royal Numismatic Society of New Zealand]] of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The corporation later shifted their base of operations to [[Waitangi, Chatham Islands|Waitangi]].

The face value of the notes was pegged at the same rate as the [[New Zealand dollar]], They are unusual in that the ist series included $3 and $15 dollar notes, while the second series includes an $8 note.

==Not Legal tender==
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand clarified that these notes are not legal tender.&lt;ref name=RBNZ&gt;{{cite web|last=Reserve Bank of New Zealand|title=Chatham Islands "dollars" not Legal Tender|url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2000/0091162.html|publisher=RBNZ.gov|accessdate=9 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106042702/http://rbnz.govt.nz/news/2000/0091162.html|archive-date=6 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Murray Sherwin mentioned that " Whilst these Chatham Island dollars are a bit of fun,... if people want to use them to undertake transactions, that's fine too."

==The Series==
Series I notes, consist of $2, $3, $10 and $15 denominations, and with a very strong influence from American currency designs. There were printed in late 1999, still in time for their release on January 1, 2000. They were printed on polymer [[Tyvek]] paper with the artwork by Timely Marketing &amp; Promotions Limited, Christchurch and [[Dunedin]], New Zealand. Tyvek is a [[plastic]]-type material, and the notes are dual-denominated—in [[Cent (currency)|cents]] as well as in [[dollar]]s. The same-numbered sets which came out in cardboard folders, also bear a completely different [[holography|hologram]], as compared to the [[currency]] issue.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The hologram is a very good security device, as it prevents [[forgery]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are three printings of this series&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Those of the 3rd printing are the only ones that have been seen by one of the authors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Full sets of this series are now scarce.

Series II notes, consisting of $3, $5, $8, $10 and $15 denominations, were printed some time during the year 2000 for release in 2001. They are printed on [[cotton]]-fibre [[paper]] by Chan Wanich Security Printing Company Limited, [[Thailand]]. The front of these notes is very similar to the Series I notes, apart from the dates and other details. Again, these notes are dual-denominated in cents and dollars. There are also three printings of this series with same-serial numbered sets produced, but not in cardboard folders, having a different hologram than the first currency issue. This hologram is unique in that it incorporates an albatross bird that flies when viewed through a special security device.

In 2001, a $5 coin was put into circulation at the same time as the Series II notes. A 5,000 piece issue was then planned, however, informed of the intention to issue a coin, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand banned the issue, despite the fact that there is no $5 coin in circulation in New Zealand. An estimated 200 pieces ended up in the [[numismatic]] trade.&lt;ref group="n"&gt; There are only 200 of the Chatham Islands $5 coins known to exist, specially minted for the release date and issued to the numismatic trade (or to Leon Morel) prior to the ban.&lt;/ref&gt; The balance, other than a remaining 100 held by CINC, were never minted.

==Description==
To assist collectors and dealers, a catalogue numbering system has been provided. Below, 'Work' numbers (indicated by the letter 'W') to the items, have been assigned for clarity.&lt;ref name=Atsnotes&gt;{{cite web|last=World Paper Money Catalog and History|title=Chatham Islands banknotes (private issue)|url=http://www.atsnotes.com/catalog/banknotes/chatham.html|publisher=Atsnotes.com|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hologram depicts a globe showing the [[Pacific Rim|Asia-Pacific]] region with '1st' superimposed, an inner circle with the words 'WORLD FIRST' and 'AUTHENTIC' (which can be seen depending on the direction in which a note is tilted), and an outer circle, which has a rainbow pattern going around like a flywheel. The notes of the same-serial numbered folder issue has '1st' printed in white on top of the hologram, which has an interlocking pattern consisting of the year 2000.

The '''LOLCat Bible Translation Project''' is a [[wiki|wiki-based]] website set up in July 2007 by Martin Grondin, where editors aim to parody the entire [[Bible]] in "[[Lolcat|LOLspeak]]", the slang popularized by the [[Lolcat|LOLcat]] Internet phenomenon.&lt;ref name="seattlepi"&gt;{{cite news | first=Monika | last=Guzman | coauthors= | title=Time Killer: The "lolcat" bible | date=2007-10-19 | publisher= | url =http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/thebigblog/archives/124063.asp?from=blog_last3 | work =Seattle Post-Intelligencer | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project relies on contributors to adapt passages. As of March 27, 2008, approximately 61% of the text had been adapted, and Grondin had stated that he hopes the entire New Testament would be complete by the end of 2008.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Charlie |last=Amter |title=Lolcat Bible Translation Project presents the Gospel according to Fluffy |date=2007-12-16 |url=http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-ca-lolcat16dec16,1,6069575.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |work=Los Angeles Times |pages= |accessdate=2007-12-23 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224021046/http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-ca-lolcat16dec16%2C1%2C6069575.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |archivedate=2007-12-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}   Also available [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/16/entertainment/ca-lolcat16 here] at [[latimes.com]] under the title "It's the Gospel according to kittah".&lt;/ref&gt;

A book version of the website was released in 2010, containing selected extracts such as the stories of the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation of the earth]], [[Adam and Eve]], and [[Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;Google Books preview: [https://books.google.com/books?id=P9Er3dSUjzYC&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ceiling Cat Maek Awl teh Stuffz], p. 14; [https://books.google.com/books?id=P9Er3dSUjzYC&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Adam An Eve], p. 17; [https://books.google.com/books?id=P9Er3dSUjzYC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Noah's Reely Big Bowt], p.26. Accessed 2013-08-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing process==
In the process of adaptation, various changes are being made to the source material, for example, changing the main characters to cats – e.g., [[Jesus Christ]] becomes "Happy Cat," [[God]] the "[[Ceiling Cat]]," and [[Satan]] the "[[Basement Cat]]" – while the "gifts" and "blessings" of God have become "cheezburgerz", and people in general have become "kittehs".&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Other changes include "Hover Cat" for the [[Holy Spirit]] and "Bird Cats" for [[angel]]s.  The use of "cheezburgers" is an allusion to the [[I Can Has Cheezburger?|icanhascheezburger.com]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;  The style of writing employed varies, but the most devoted contributors have been described as those who utilize as many as possible of the gags and themes used in the different lolcat images.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;

Unlike most Bible translation efforts, the LOLCat Bible Translation Project does not depend on one or a group of prominent individual translators, but on crowdsourced translation. Untranslated sections are available for translation by anyone willing to register on the wiki. The current most active members of that crowd are listed on the project's Active users list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lolcatbible.com/index.php?title=Special:ActiveUsers LOLCat Bible wiki Active users list]. Accessed 2013-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
The project has been praised by [[Ben Huh]], owner of the website that popularized lolcats,&lt;ref&gt;"Lolcats' demented captions create a new Web language", Tamara Ikenberg, ''[[The News Journal]]'', 9 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[I Can Has Cheezburger?|icanhascheezburger.com]], who noted that the LOLCat Bible had inspired other religious texts to be translated into LOLspeak, such as the [[Qur'an]], and that it has made clear that "the ability to publish is now open to anyone".&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; An editorial in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' commented, "The effort to translate the Bible into a language full of grammatical errors, hacker acronyms and Internet lingo may appear distasteful or blasphemous to some, but not to worry. Much of the translation only loosely follows the Bible. It's crowded with references to lolcats pictures and to ambiguous Internet humor, and these references can only be understood by people who spend too much time on the Web."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Gospel according to kitty |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=2008-01-01 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-0101edit3jan01,0,4695276.story |accessdate=2010-12-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117163225/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-0101edit3jan01%2C0%2C4695276.story |archivedate=2008-01-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2321">[[File:Lalibela Cross.jpg|thumb|[[File:Lalibella Cross.jpg|thumb]]The Lalibela Cross]]
The '''Lalibela Cross''' (or ''Afro Ayigeba'') is a large, elaborately decorated [[processional cross]], considered one of [[Ethiopia]]'s most precious religious and historical heirlooms.  It is held by the [[Bet Medhane Alem]], the House of the Redeemer of the World, a 12th-century [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] church in [[Lalibela]].  A priest may rub believers with the cross to bless them or heal them. The style of the cross was common in its time and those of this style are often simply referred to today as "Lalibela crosses".

The cross is thought to date to the 12th century.  It is around {{convert|60|cm|in}} long and weighs around {{convert|7|kg|lb}}.  It is made from one piece of metal, either [[gold]], or [[bronze]] and gold.  The central cross has an elongated descending arm and flared ends surrounded by an elaborately ornamented encircling band.  Like many Ethiopian processional crosses, the bottom of the cross is supported by "Adam's arms", a motif that realistically or abstractly portrays the arms of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;W. Korabiewicz. 1973 "The Ethiopian Cross" Holy Trinity Cathedral: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia&lt;/ref&gt;  On processional crosses they are draped with brightly colored pieces of cloth for festive occasions.      

The cross was stolen in March 1997, but located in [[Belgium]] in 1999, when a dealer in [[Addis Ababa]] sold it to a Belgian collector for US$25,000.  After the collector's money was returned and it was agreed that no further legal action would be taken, the cross was returned to Ethiopia in 2001.

The '''Mammoth spear thrower''' is a [[spear thrower]] in the form of a [[mammoth]], discovered at the [[rock shelter]] of [[Montastruc, Tarn-et-Garonne]], France. It is from the late [[Magdalenian]] period and around 12,500 years old. It now forms part of the [[Henry Christy|Christy Collection]] in the [[British Museum]] (Palart 551), and is normally on display in Room 2.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/s/mammoth_spear_thrower.aspx Spear thrower carved as a mammoth.] British Museum 2011. Retrieved 14 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 7 February – 26 May 2013 it was displayed in the exhibition at the British Museum ''Ice Age Art: Arrival of the Modern Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/ice_age_art.aspx Ice Age Art: Arrival of the Modern Mind]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

The spear thrower was carved from a reindeer antler and depicts a mammoth with a hole for an eye which probably held a bone or stone insert originally. The hook has been repaired after the antler from which it was carved broke. The tusks of the mammoth appear on each side but have mostly been lost due to damage. It is about 12&amp;nbsp;cm in length.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

The mammoth is produced in low-relief on both sides of the object. When it was discovered, the broken tail hook had already been repaired. This was achieved by drilling a hole through the mammoth shape, just in front of the broken hook - and inserting in another piece of antler (Sieveking 1987, 65).

Spear throwers were first used in western Europe about 20,000 years ago and enabled hunters to launch spears with more force and speed than if they threw just by hand. It was common for them to be decorated with animal carvings.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

Other types of spear throwers include the perforated batons, which are also often decorated. A wonderful [[Baton fragment (Palart 310)|example]] from La Madeleine can be seen at the British Museum in Room 2.

'''Mek Mulung''' ([[Jawi script|Jawi]]: '''مق مولوڠ''') is a traditional [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] theatre that unique to the northwest state of [[Kedah]] in [[Malaysia]]. It became popular since the late 18th century and incorporates most elements of [[Mak Yong]], [[Menora (dance)|Menora]] and [[Hadrah]].&lt;ref name="reference1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancemalaysia.com/Dance/Traditional/Malay_Theatre/Mek_Mulung/mek_mulung.htm|title=Mek Mulung|publisher=Dance Malaysia|accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre features a repertoire of stories from local legends, which according to a source, amounted about 20 original stories, with few of them survived today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://teaterkedah.blogspot.com/2008/01/mek-mulung-apa-kesudahannya.html MEK MULUNG : Apa kesudahannya? ]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Mak Yong, the stories are presented through dialogue, song and dance.

The musicians and actors of the theatre are exclusively male, playing both male and female roles. The basic dance movements are limited, abbreviated, crude and mainly focus on the arms, especially the to-and-fro, and up and down swinging.&lt;ref name="reference1" /&gt; 

The orchestra of Mek Mulung is predominantly percussive and consists of ''[[rebana]]'', ''[[gong]]'' and ''kecerek'' (concussion sticks). A small [[oboe]], the only melodic instruments in the orchestra, complements other instruments. The musicians also do the singing, typically in syllabic style, with little vocal ornamentation.&lt;ref name="Reference 1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music|page=228|author=Terry Miller &amp;  Sean Williams|isbn=978-0-415-96075-5|year= 2008|publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance normally begins with a ritual known as ''bertabuh'' where all musical instruments will be played simultaneously. Then, an opening song called ''bertabik'' will be sung in group and accompanied by dancing movements. There are up to 7 types of dance in Mek Mulung:

1. ''Tarian Sembah''&lt;br&gt;
2. ''Tarian Gambang''&lt;br&gt;
3. ''Tarian Puteri Mabuk''&lt;br&gt;
4. ''Tarian Menora'' &lt;br&gt;
5. ''Tarian Sirama'' &lt;br&gt;
6. ''Tarian Puteri Masuk Bilik Air''&lt;br&gt;
7. ''Tarian Sedayung''

The singing of ''bertabik'' then followed by the recitation of stories from [[List of Hikayat|Hikayats]] by ''Pak Mulung'', and roles from the stories will be visualised by actors performance. The transition between scenes in the stories will be marked with a singing and [[pantun]] exchange.  The theatre is typically performed in series and can take up to 3 nights to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mykedah2.com/10heritage/105_5.html#top|title=Mek Mulung|publisher=Kedah State Library Corporation|accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mention My Name in Atlantis, being, at last, the true account of the calamitous destruction of the great island kingdom together with a narrative of its wondrous intercourses with a superior race of other-worldlings, as transcribed from the manuscript of a survivor, Hoptor the Vintner, for the enlightenment of a dubious posterity''''' is a humorous [[fantasy]] novel written by [[John Jakes]] purporting to give the "true" history of the sinking of the lost continent of [[Atlantis]]. It was first published in paperback by [[DAW Books]] in October 1972, and reprinted by the same publisher in September 1975 and August 1976; the later printings featured new cover art by [[Michael Whelan]]. A new paperback edition with an added introduction by the author was published by Bart Books in January 1988, and an ebook edition was issued by Open Road Integrated Media in December 2014. The book has also been translated into [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{isfdb title|id=17372|title=Mention My Name in Atlantis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story is told by the [[unreliable narrator]] Hoptor the Vintner, a fast-talking operator with all the right contacts who is convinced in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary that he can smooth over anything. "Mention my name" is his tagline, meant to assure his auditors that dropping it in various quarters is their ticket to getting whatever they want. The book combines a number of cliches of the literature and pseudoscience regarding Atlantis, such as extraterrestrial visitors, as well as of the fantasy genre in general, most notably the ambitious barbarian brute, Conax of Chimeria, a satire on [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[sword and sorcery]] hero [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan of Cimmeria]].

==Reception==
[[Lester del Rey]] described the satire as "good-natured and sometimes amusing," but felt the idea of writing a humorous sword-and-sorcery novel was misconceived.&lt;ref&gt;"Reading Room", [[If (magazine)|''If'']], June 1973, pp.171-72&lt;/ref&gt;

The''' Michigan Digitization Project''' is a project in  partnership with [[Google Books]] to digitize the entire print collection of the [[University of Michigan Library]]. The digitized collection is available through the University of Michigan Library catalog, [http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/ Mirlyn], the [http://www.hathitrust.org/ HathiTrust Digital Library], and [[Google Book Search]]. Full-text of works that are out of copyright or in the public domain are available.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson Scott and Jeffrey R. Young.

According to the [[University of Michigan Library|University of Michigan University Library]], they embarked on this partnership for a number of reasons:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* The project will create new ways for users to search and access Library content, opening up our library collections to our own users and to users throughout the world
* Although we have engaged in large-scale (preservation-based) conversion of parts of the Library's collection for several years, we know that only through partnerships of this sort can something of this scale be achieved
* We believe that, beyond providing basic access to Library collections, this activity is critically transformative, enabling the University Library to build on and reconceive vital Library services for the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.umich.edu/mdp/ Michigan Digitization Project] About page&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multicultural education''' is  a set of educational strategies developed to assist teachers when responding to the many issues created by the rapidly changing demographics of their students. It provides students with knowledge about the histories, cultures, and contributions of diverse groups; it assumes that the future society is [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]]. It draws on insights from a number of different fields, including [[ethnic studies]] and [[women studies]], and reinterprets content from related academic disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, J.A., &amp; Banks, C.A.M. (Eds). (1995). ''Handbook of research on multicultural education''. New York: Macmillan. {{ISBN|9780028957975}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also viewed as a way of teaching that promotes the principles of inclusion, diversity, democracy, skill acquisition, inquiry, critical thought, value of perspectives, and self-reflection.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"&gt;O'Donnell, C. Commentary. [Web log comment]. Retrieved from http://www.learner.org/workshops/tml/workshop1/commentary.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of teaching is found to be effective in promoting educational achievements among immigrants students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kislev|first=E.|date=2016-05-01|title=The effect of education policies on higher-education attainment of immigrants in Western Europe: A cross-classified multilevel analysis|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301712187_The_effect_of_education_policies_on_higher-education_attainment_of_immigrants_in_Western_Europe_A_cross-classified_multilevel_analysis|journal=Journal of European Social Policy|volume=26|issue=2|pages=183–199|doi=10.1177/0958928716637142|issn=0958-9287}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is thus attributed to the reform movement behind the transformation of schools.

==Aims and objectives==

The aims and objectives of multicultural education tend to vary among educational philosophers and liberal political theorists. Educational philosophers argue for preservation of the minority group culture, by fostering children's development of autonomy and introducing them to new and different ideas. This form of exposure assists children in thinking more critically, as well as, encourage them to have a more open mindset.&lt;ref name="Levinson, M. 2009"&gt;Levinson, M. (2009) Ch. 23. 'Mapping Multicultural Education' in Harvey Seigel, ed., The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Education (Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, political theorists advocate a model of multicultural education that warrants social action. Hence, students are equipped with knowledge, values, and skills necessary to evoke and participate in societal changes, resulting in justice for otherwise victimized and excluded ethnic groups. Under such a model, teachers serve as agents of such change, promoting relevant democratic values and empowering students to act.&lt;ref name="Banks 2013" /&gt; Multicultural education has a host of other gains and goals:

* Promote civic good
* Rectify historical records
* Increase [[self-esteem]] of non-mainstream students
* Increase [[diversity (politics)|diversified]] student exposure
* Preserve minority group culture
* Foster children's autonomy
* Promote [[social justice]] and equity
* Enable students to succeed economically in an integrated, multicultural world&lt;ref name="Levinson, M. 2009" /&gt;

The outcomes listed might require great investment or additional effort from the teacher to ensure that the goals being sought are met. Multicultural education, in its ideal form,must be in an active and intentional structure, rather than a passive, accidental approach.

There are infinite ways to assure that such an educational approach is purposeful and successful. Adaptation and modification to established curriculum serve as an example of an approach to preserving minority group culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, M. (2009). 'Mapping Multicultural Education' in Harvey Seigel, ed., The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Education (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Brief sensitivity training, separate units on ethnic celebrations, and closer attention paid to instances of prejudice, are examples of minimal approaches, which are less likely to reap long term benefits for students. Multicultural education should span beyond autonomy, by exposing students to global uniqueness, fostering deepened understanding, and providing access to varied practices, ideas, and ways of life; it is a process of societal transformation and reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Levinson, M. 2009" /&gt; "Creating inclusive campus environments is challenging, but there is also great personal reward to be gained from helping create a campus 'laboratory for learning how to live and interrelate within a complex world'&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt; and to prepare students to make significant contributions to that world."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Views==

===Multicultural education and politics===

Advocates of democracy in schooling, led by John Dewey (1859–1952), argued that public education was needed to educate all children. Universal voting, along with universal education would make our society more democratic. An educated electorate would understand politics and the economy and make wise decisions. Later, by the 1960s, public education advocates argued that educating working people to a higher level (such as the G.I. Bill) would complete our transition to a deliberative or participatory democracy. This position is well developed by political philosopher Benjamin R. Barber in Strong Democracy: Participatory Politics for a New Age, first published in 1984 and published again in 2003. According to Barber, multicultural education in public schools would promote acceptance of diversity. Levinson (2009) argues that "multicultural education is saddled with so many different conceptions that it is inevitably self-contradictory both in theory and in practice, it cannot simultaneously achieve all of the goals it is called upon to serve" (p.&amp;nbsp;428) Multicultural education should reflect the student body, as well as promote understanding of diversity to the dominant culture and be inclusive, visible, celebrated and tangible. Multicultural education is appropriate for everyone. According to Banks (2013), "a major goal of multicultural education is to change teaching and learning approaches so that students of both genders and from diverse cultural, ethnic, and language groups will have equal opportunities to learn in educational institutions" (p.&amp;nbsp;10). Citizens need multicultural education in order to enter into the dialogue with fellow citizens and future citizens. Furthermore, multicultural education should include preparation for an active, participatory citizenship. Multicultural education is a way to promote the civic good. Levinson (2009) describes four ways to do so: From learning about other cultures comes tolerance, tolerance promotes respect, respect leads to open mindedness which results in civic reasonableness and equality (p.&amp;nbsp;431-432)

James Banks, a lifetime leader in multicultural education and a former president of both the National Council for the Social Studies and the American Educational Research Association, describes the balancing forces in [8] (4th. Edition, 2008) "Citizenship education must be transformed in the 21st Century because of the deepening racial, ethnic, cultural, language and religious diversity in nation-states around the world. Citizens in a diverse democratic society should be able to maintain attachments to their cultural communities as well as participate effectively in the shared national culture. Unity without diversity results in cultural repression and hegemony. Diversity without unity leads to Balkanization and the fracturing of the nation-state. Diversity and unity should coexist in a delicate balance in democratic multicultural nation-states." [9] Planning curriculum for schools in a multicultural democracy involves making some value choices. Schools are not neutral. The schools were established and funded to promote democracy and citizenship. A pro-democracy position is not neutral; teachers should help schools promote diversity. The myth of school neutrality comes from a poor understanding of the philosophy of positivism. Rather than neutrality, schools should plan and teach cooperation, mutual respect, the dignity of individuals and related democratic values. Schools, particularly integrated schools, provide a rich site where students can meet one another, learn to work together, and be deliberative about decision making. In addition to democratic values, deliberative strategies and teaching decision-making provide core procedures for multicultural education.&lt;ref&gt;From: Choosing Democracy; a practical guide to multicultural education. 4th. ed. 2010.

===Meira Levinson===

According to Levinson, three distinct groups present different conceptions of "multicultural education." These groups are: political and educational philosophers, educational theorists, and educational practitioners. In the minds of the members of these groups, multicultural education has different, and sometimes conflicting, aims within schools. Philosophers see multicultural education as a method of response to minorities within a society who advocate for their own group's rights or who advocate for special considerations for members of that group, as a means for developing a child's sense of autonomy, and as a function of the civic good. Educational theorists differ from philosophers in that theorists seek to restructure schools and curriculum to enact "social justice and real equality" (Levinson, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;433). By restructuring schools in this way, educational theorists hope that society will thus be restructured as students who received a multicultural education become contributing members of the political landscape. The third and final group, educational practitioners, holds the view that multicultural education increases the [[self-esteem]] of students from minority cultures and prepares them to become successful in the global marketplace. Though there are overlaps in these aims, Levinson notes that one goal, cited by of all three prominent groups within the field of education, is that of "righting the historical record" (p.&amp;nbsp;435).

===Joe Kincheloe and Shirley Steinberg===

Kincheloe and Steinberg in Changing Multiculturalism (1997) described confusion in the use of the terms "multiculturalism" and "multicultural education". In an effort to clarify the conversation about the topic, they developed a taxonomy of the diverse ways the term was used. The authors warn their readers that they overtly advocate a critical multicultural position and that readers should take this into account as they consider their taxonomy.[2] Within their taxonomy, Kincheloe and Steinberg break down multiculturalism into five categories: conservative multiculturalism, liberal multiculturalism, pluralist multiculturalism, left-essentialist multiculturalism, and critical multiculturalism. These categories are named based on beliefs held by the two largest schools of political thought (liberalism and conservatism) within American society, and they reflect the tenets of each strand of political thought. In terms of Levinson's (2010) ideas, conservative multiculturalism, liberal multiculturalism, and pluralist multiculturalism view multicultural education as an additive to existing curriculum, while left-essentialist multiculturalism and critical multiculturalism see to restructure education, and thus, society.

===David Labaree===

David Labaree's Democratic Equality ideology, which is defined in Labaree's article, Public Goods, Private Goods: The American Struggle Over Educational Goals is a perfect example of different aspects of Multicultural Education. A teacher using Labaree's Democratic Equality, would have students who are able to feel like they belong in the classroom, which teaches students equal treatment, and gives support to multiculturalism, non-academic curriculum options, and cooperative learning (Labaree (1997), 45). Labaree use of Democratic Equality supports a multicultural education because "in the democratic political arena, we are all considered equal (according to the rule of one person, one vote), but this political equality can be undermined if the social inequality of citizens grows too great" (Labaree (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;42). By providing opportunities to engaged and enrich children with different cultures, abilities, and ethnicities we allow children to become more familiar with people that are different from them, hoping to allow a greater acceptance in society. By representing a variety of cultures reflected by the students in the classroom, children will feel like they have a voice or a place at school.

==History in the United States==

Multicultural affairs offices and centers were established to reconcile the inconsistencies in students' experiences by creating a space on campus where students who were [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] because of their culture could feel affirmed and connected to the institution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rentz's Student Affairs Practice in Higher Education|last=Zhang|first=Naijian|publisher=Charles C. Thomas|year=2011|isbn=978-0-398-07965-9|location=Springfield, IL|pages=246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial steps towards multicultural education can be traced as far back as 1896 with the United States Supreme Court case, ''[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_plessy.html Plessy v. Ferguson]''. In this controversial case, the decision upheld the constitutionality of [[racial segregation]] in all public establishments under the policy of "separate but equal."

Even after the adopting the [http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=40 Thirteenth Amendment] in 1865, where slavery was officially abolished, there was still great racial tension within the United States. To help support the ideals contained within the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress adopted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which provided all citizens the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/privileges_and_immunities_clause privileges and immunities clause], as well as the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection equal protection clause].

The complete assimilation of all segments of a community is necessary for it to be immune to innuendo of threat from the unfamiliar. Multicultural education stands as a shield against divisive rumors, and so [[The Springfield Plan]] was implemented during the 1940s in Springfield, Massachusetts, by advocates for the [[Institute for Propaganda Analysis]]. The Springfield Plan addressed [[racism]] as one of the more debilitating weaknesses of a community.

It was the equal protection clause within the [http://www.14thamendment.us/amendment/14th_amendment.html Fourteenth Amendment] that stirred the debate of racial equality in 1954. The unanimous 9-0 Supreme Court decision in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] ruled that separate schools for black and white students was, in fact unequal, thus overturning the 60-year-old Plessy v. Ferguson decision. It was this victory that widened the path towards multicultural education and laid the course for nationwide integration, as well as a tremendous boost for the civil rights movement. Multicultural education considers an equal opportunity for learning beyond the simple trappings of race and gender. It includes students from varying [[social classes]], ethnic groups, [[sexual identities]], and additional cultural characteristics.&lt;ref name="Banks 2013"&gt;Banks and Banks, eds. 2013. Multicultural Education, 'Multicultural Education: Characteristics and Goals', 'Culture, Teaching and Learning' (John Wiley &amp; Sons).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there are other views that show the contrary. The fame of [[Brown v. Board of Education]] was to undercover all the issues on [[Racial segregation|segregation]] that were still happening in schools. No matter how much everyone talked or used Brown v. Board of Education as a source to show a positive impact on integration, the reality was that students were still being treated unequally and separated from the rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America|last = Kozol|first = Jonathan|publisher = Random House|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4000-5245-5|location = New York|pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

10 years later the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], known as [http://today.uconn.edu/blog/2014/07/the-civil-rights-act-of-1964-revisited/ "the most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction"] was enacted. It outlawed discrimination in public spaces and establishments, made it illegal for any workplace and employment discrimination, and it made integration possible for schools and other public spaces possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=old&amp;doc=97&lt;/ref&gt; Students of exception are also a group that civil rights advocates have been fighting for in the implementation of quality multicultural education. With the continued support from civil rights groups coming out of their struggle, many of these students found support on a scale much larger due to the major push in education to provide equity to all students.

In 1968, the implementation of the [[Bilingual Education Act]] was prompted by limited English-speaking minorities, especially Spanish-speaking citizens who denounced the idea of assimilation into the Western way of thinking in fear of losing their personal connectedness to one's heritage and cultural ideals. It was in their hopes that "their lives and histories be included in the curriculum of schools, colleges, and universities…multicultural educators sought to transform the Euro-centric perspective and incorporate multiple perspectives into the curriculum". After 36 years, the Bilingual Education Act was dissolved and in 2002 the needs of English Language Learners were picked up by the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].

The [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s was a way to eliminate discrimination in public accommodations, housing, employment, and education.&lt;ref name="Banks 2013"/&gt; The movement pushed for minority teachers and administrators, community control and revision of textbooks to reflect the diversity of peoples in the United States. Multicultural education became a standard in university studies for new teachers, as Fullinwider states. One of the main focuses of this study was to have students identify their own culture as important, as well as, recognize the unique differences in other cultures. Multicultural education began to represent the significance in understanding and respecting diversity in various groups as much as finding the important meaning within one's own cultural identity. The success of the Civil Rights Movement sparked an interest in the women's rights movement, along with the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975]]. Currently, "practicing educators use the term multicultural education to describe a wide variety of programs and practices related to [[educational equity]], women, [[ethnic group]]s, [[minority language|language minorities]], low-income groups, [[LGBT]] (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) people, and people with disabilities".&lt;ref name="Banks 2013"/&gt; Additionally, learning styles within these groups can be different and recognizing this has supported changes educators are making to their approaches in the classroom. There is not a single standard for each sub group as it relates to learning styles. A general example is African-American students learn more productively in a group setting because their cultural components showcase a stronger attachment to the whole, as mentioned by Fullinwider. European-Americans, as an example, could be viewed to be more independent based on their cultural ties to learning styles.

During the 1980s, educators developed a new approach to the field of multicultural education, examining schools as social systems and promoting the idea of [[educational equality]].&lt;ref name="Gorski"&gt;Gorski, P.C. A Brief History of Multicultural Education. Hamline University. Retrieved from http://red.pucp.edu.pe/ridei/files/2012/11/121111.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 1982 [[Plyler v. Doe]] Supreme Court shed light on the advances in the field of multicultural education as it upheld the educational rights of illegal immigrant children. In the 1990s, educators expanded the study of multicultural education to consider "larger societal and global dimensions of power, privilege, and economics."&lt;ref name="Gorski" /&gt; The shifting student populations of the 20th century have given multicultural education a new perspective to see the classroom as a community of diversity amongst its learners and not one of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] to a dominant culture&lt;ref name="newhorizons.org"&gt;Hanley, M.S. (1999). "The Scope of Multicultural Education". www.newhorizons.org&lt;/ref&gt; The continued advancement of ideas to improve multicultural education is allowing students and teachers to strive for improving exposure to all cultural differences while never seeking an end to the progress. The numbers of minority students continue to increase in education that a multicultural approach is no longer looked at simply as educating the minority, as they will soon be the majority. Education has had to take a deeper look as educators recognize an increasingly multicultural nation and a shrinking planet demands people who are critical thinkers able to handle the complex realities of multicultural differences.&lt;ref name="newhorizons.org"/&gt;
At the turn of the century in 2001, the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], aimed primarily at helping disadvantaged students, required "all public schools receiving federal funding to administer a state-wide standardized test annually to all students."&lt;ref&gt;[[No Child Left Behind Act]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, with the Race to the Top initiative, "Many advocates of multicultural education quickly found attention to diversity and equity being replaced by attention to standards and student test scores".&lt;ref name="Banks 2013"/&gt;

As multicultural education moves rapidly into the mainstream of the 21st century, the current focus is on moving towards an "intercultural model that advances a climate of inclusion where individual and group differences are valued."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, one must not forget the initial intentions of this model. When the civil rights movement and women's rights movement gained significant traction in support of their freedoms, multicultural education was beginning to receive similar support. Initially, multicultural education had intentions to expose and educate on the [[institutionalized racism]] that existed in the education system. Schools were, and had for many years, approached education from a singular historical perspective, aimed to educate a narrow student population. What seems to have been lost with the introduction of multicultural education was the desired outcome. Many people at the time of these various freedom movements sought to expose the lack of diversity in [[curriculum]] by introducing more culturally diverse content. The field of multicultural education can be criticized for turning away from its initial critique of racism in education&lt;ref name="rethinkingschools.org"&gt;Sleeter, C. &amp; McLaren, P. (2000). "Origins of Multiculturalism". www.rethinkingschools.org&lt;/ref&gt; and allowing the superficial exposure of cultures to become the standard in multicultural education. It should be remembered that inequality and oppression of families and communities was the initial objective set forth with this new idea of multicultural education. Colleges and public schools can make improvements to this field by revisiting the foundations of this freedom movement to be racism existing in education. Many minority groups are already recognizing an importance to be based strongly in one's own cultural identity before attempting to enter into a multicultural world continually dominated by systematic levels of oppression.&lt;ref name="rethinkingschools.org"/&gt;

== Implementation in the classroom ==
Multicultural education encompasses many important dimensions. Practicing educators can use the dimensions as a way to incorporate culture in their classrooms. The five dimensions listed below are:&lt;ref&gt;(Banks, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;19.)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Content Integration: Content integration deals with the extent to which teachers use examples and content from a variety of cultures in their teaching.
# Knowledge construction: Teachers need to help students understand, investigate, and determine how the implicit cultural assumptions, frames of reference, perspectives, and biases within a discipline influence the ways in which knowledge is constructed.
# Prejudice Reduction: This dimension focuses on the characteristics of students' racial attitudes and how they can be modified by teaching methods and materials.
# Empowering School Culture: Grouping and labeling practices, sports participation, disproportionality in achievement, and the interaction of the staff and the students across ethnic and racial lines must be examined to create a school culture that empowers students from diverse racial, ethnic, and gender groups.
# Equity Pedagogy: An equity pedagogy exists when teachers modify their teaching in ways that will facilitate the academic achievement of students from diverse racial, cultural, gender, and social-class groups.

Multicultural education can be implemented on the macro-level with the implementation of programs and culture at the school-wide or district-wide level and also at the mico-level by specific teachers within their individual classrooms.

===School and district-wide practices for the promotion of multicultural education===

While individual teachers may work to teach in ways that support multicultural ideas, in order to truly experience a multicultural education, there must be a commitment at the school or district level. In developing a school or district wide plan for multicultural education, Dr. Steven L. Paine, West Virginia State Superintendent of schools gives these suggestions: 
* Involve stakeholders in the decision-making process.
* Examine the school climate and culture and the roles played by both students and staff. 
* Gather information on what is currently being done to promote multicultural education already.
* Establish school-wide activities throughout the year that support multicultural themes.
* Focus on student and teacher outcomes that involve a knowledge of diversity, respect, cooperation, and communication. Involve the community in this plan.&lt;ref&gt;West Virginia Board of Education (2006). "Multicultural Education in 21st Century Schools." Retrieved 2 April 2015, from http://wvconnections.k12.wv.us/multiculturaled.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multicultural teaching strategies and practices===

Robert K. Fullinwider (2003) describes one rather controversial method for multicultural teaching: teaching to "culturally distinct" learning styles. While studies have shown that "the longer these students of color remain in school, the more their achievement lags behind that of White mainstream students",&lt;ref&gt;(Banks, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;3)&lt;/ref&gt; it is still highly debated whether or not learning styles, are indeed culturally distinctive, and furthermore, whether implementing different teaching strategies with different racial or ethnic groups would help or further alienate minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;(Fullinwider, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp; 5-6)&lt;/ref&gt;

All students have different learning styles so incorporating multicultural education techniques into the classroom, may allow all students to be more successful. "Multicultural education needs to enable students to succeed economically in a multicultural world by teaching them to be comfortable in a diverse workforce and skillful at integrating into a global economy".&lt;ref&gt;(Levinson, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;435)&lt;/ref&gt; Teacher's should align the curriculum with the groups being taught, rather than about them. Every child can learn so it is the teacher's responsibility to not "track" them, but rather to personalize the curriculum to reach every student. "Teachers need to assume that students are capable of learning complex material and performing at a high level of skill. Each student has a personal, unique learning style that teachers discover and build on when teaching".&lt;ref&gt;(Banks, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;50)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important consideration in implementing multicultural education into the classroom is how deep to infuse multicultural ideas and perspectives into the curriculum. There are four different approaches or levels to curricular infusion. They are: 
# The Contributions Approach – Dubbed the "Heroes and Holidays" approach; it is the easiest to implement and makes the least impact on the current curriculum. It does however have significant limitations in meeting the goals of multicultural education because "it does not give students the opportunity to see the critical role of ethnic groups in US society. Rather, the individuals and celebrations are seen as an addition or appendage that is virtually unimportant to the core subject areas".&lt;ref name="ncsall.net"&gt;Cumming-McCann, A. (2003). "Multicultural Education Connecting Theory to Practice." Retrieved 2 April 2015, from http://www.ncsall.net/index.html@id=208.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Additive Approach – Called the ethnic additive approach; it is slightly more involved than the contributions approach, but still requires no major restructuring of the curriculum. While this approach is often a first step towards a more multicultural curriculum, it is still very limited in that it still presents the topic from the dominant perspective. "Individuals or groups of people from marginalized groups in society are included in the curriculum, yet racial and cultural inequalities or oppression are not necessarily addressed".&lt;ref name="ncsall.net"/&gt;
# The Transformative Approach – This approach requires pulling in multiple perspectives while discussing a topic. This approach is significantly more challenging to teach than the previous two: "it requires a complete transformation of the curriculum and, in some cases, a conscious effort on the part of the teacher to deconstruct what they have been taught to think, believe, and teach".&lt;ref name="ncsall.net"/&gt;
# The Decision Making and Social Action Approach – This approach includes all of the elements of the transformative approach but also challenges students to work to bring about social change. The goal of this approach is not only to make students aware of past and present injustice, but to equip them and empower them to be the agents of change.&lt;ref name="ncsall.net"/&gt;
In looking into practical strategies for implementing multicultural education into the classroom, Andrew Miller offers several suggestions that might provide helpful: 
* Get to know your students. Build relationships and learn about their backgrounds and cultures. 
* Use art as a starting point in discussions of cultural and racial issues. 
* Have students create collective classroom slang dictionaries. 
* Find places in your current curriculum to embed multicultural lessons, ideas, and materials. (Please note that for this to be most effective, it must be a continuous process, not merely the celebration of Black History Month or a small aside in a textbook.) 
* Allow controversy. Open your classroom up to respectful discussions about race, culture, and other differences. 
* Find allies in your administration who will support your work.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, A. (2011). "Seven Ideas for Revitalizing Multicultural Education." Retrieved 2 April 2015, from http://www.edutopia.org/blog/multicultural-education-strategy-tips-andrew-miller&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another essential part of multicultural teaching is examining your current lesson materials for bias that might alienate the students you are trying to teach. The Safe School Coalition warns against using a curricular material "if it omits the history, contributions and lives of a group, if ti demeans a group by using patronizing or clinically distancing language, or if it portrays a group in stereotyped roles with less than a full range of interests, traits and capabilities."&lt;ref&gt;Safe School Coalition, The. (2003). "Guidelines for Identifying Bias." Retrieved 2 April 2015, from http://www.safeschoolscoalition.org/guidelinesonbias-screen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical literacy practices in early childhood education===
The development of multicultural education is introduced at a young age in order to allow children to build a global perspective.&lt;ref name="Deprez, M. 2010"&gt;Deprez, M. (2010). The Use of Critical Literacy Practices with Young Children: For the Development of Social and Cultural Awareness. International Journal of Learning, 17(7), 479-485.&lt;/ref&gt; Multicultural education can be introduced to children through the use of critical literacy practices; this will enable children to build an honest relationship with the world while recognizing multiple perspectives and ideologies.&lt;ref name="Deprez, M. 2010"/&gt; Teachers can use critical literacy practices to pose questions that will make students analyze, question and reflect upon what they are reading. Critical literacy can be useful by enabling teachers to move beyond mere awareness of, and respect for, and general recognition of the fact that different groups have different values or express similar values in different ways. There are three different approaches to critical literacy:
# Examining texts for voice and perspective
# Using texts as a vehicle to examine larger social issues
# Using student's lives and experiences as the text and incorporating literacy practices&lt;ref name="Deprez, M. 2010"/&gt;

The choice of literature is important. The books must be chosen with careful consideration over how they represent the culture it is displaying, making sure that it is void of any racial or cultural stereotypes and discrimination. Criteria includes books that:
* Explore differences rather than making them invisible
* Enrich understandings of history and life and give voice to those traditionally silenced or marginalized
* Show how people can begin to take action on social issues
* Explore dominant systems of meanings that operate in our society to position people and groups of people as "others"
* Don't provide happily ever after endings or complex social problems&lt;ref name="Deprez, M. 2010"/&gt;

"After reading these books, dialog can follow that will enable understanding and facilitate making connections to one's life. It is in this discussion that universal threads of similarities and the appreciation of differences may be explored in a way that will enable the students to make connections that span different cultures and continents. However rudimentary these connections may be, they serve as a starting point for a new way of thinking."&lt;ref name="Deprez, M. 2010"/&gt;

===Multicultural education programs implemented in schools===

Focusing on minority groups can affect their future education. Cammarota's (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cammarota|first=Julio|date=2007|title=A social justice approach to achievement: guiding Latino/a students toward educational attainment with a challenging, socially relevant curriculum|url=|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|volume=40|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team Program, intended for high school Latino/a students of low socioeconomic status and considered "at risk" of dropping out, was made to improve test scores and complete credits in order to graduate. Students felt they went from not caring about school at all to having a sense of empowerment from the program, which led to motivation to get better grades, finish school and have more confidence in themselves as who they are. From student evaluations after the program was over, 93% of the students believed the curriculum encouraged them to pursue a higher education, and their rates of going to college was higher than the national average for Latino/a students across the United States. Team Program for other minorities in more schools can influence more student outlooks on their education and can assist them in completing necessary credits for high school graduation. When schools are able to focus on inequity of minority students, school can become the foundation to the students' futures and create a positive, safe experience for them, where they will feel empowered to carry out in their future education and verify their importance within themselves.

Multicultural education can ultimately affect the way students perceive themselves. Six students felt their multicultural self-awareness grew and felt supported in their growth after taking a multicultural education course aimed to see if their self-awareness altered (Lobb, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lobb|first=Pamela|date=2012|title=Making multicultural education personal|url=|journal=Multicultural Perspectives|volume=14|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also felt their cultural competency improved. Multicultural education is beneficial in academic, emotional and personal ways in which they learn about others and even themselves. As student perspectives of multicultural education remain positive, allowing other students to become exposed to this subject may encourage and conclude in consistent, positive attitudes towards other cultures. Curriculum, sequence, class climate, and grading criteria should be prioritized to see its impact on student learning. Replicating the course in order to give students from other schools the opportunity to take multicultural education courses in order to gain more perspectives and leads to transforming attitudes and create change.

===Multicultural education curriculum examined in colleges===

Multicultural education plays a huge role in the way students perceive themselves and others, but there is still more work to be done. In some college syllabi, there is cultural sensitivity and multicultural competence. However, a lot of them lack the design to prepare teachers with consistent ways of the defining principles of multicultural education and preparation of teaching multicultural education authentically (Gorski, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorsky|first=Paul|date=2008|title=What we're teaching teachers: an analysis of multicultural teacher education coursework syllabi|url=|journal=Teaching and Teaching Education|volume=25|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multicultural education is a complex subject with many concepts. It is important for teachers to be fully knowledgeable of its depth and open to learn more about it as time goes on so they can create a safe space for their students. It is also important to see that although multicultural education is becoming more known and taught, there is still so much to learn and discover within this topic, and there always will be more to learn as we evolve. Even teachers need to be taught and become exposed to different dimensions of multicultural education in order to teach and revolutionize student attitudes about this topic.

== Multicultural education programs implemented for teachers ==
New teachers can be blind to the diversity of their students, which can lead to generalizations and stereotypes about different cultures. New teachers being able to take a multicultural education class leads to increased knowledge of diversity, altering of attitudes towards multiculturalism, and preparedness of them teaching multicultural education to students of a variety of backgrounds (Wasonga, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasonga|first=Teresa|date=2005|title=Multicultural education knowledgebase, attitudes, and preparedness for diversity|url=|journal=International Journal of Educational Management|volume=19|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparing those teachers include being able to effectively confront fears and openness of talking about sensitive subjects, such as diversity issues and transforming attitudes that students may also possess towards different cultures. Multicultural education courses conclude eye-opening measures for the teachers, including becoming more open to such issues and positively affected preparedness to teach about multicultural education to their students.

A similar result happened in another study, in which the multicultural education course led to "increased awareness, understanding, and appreciation of other cultures." This includes having a better vision of a multicultural setting in a classroom, become more flexible when it comes to multicultural issues, and becoming more open to different perspectives of different students (Cho &amp; DeCastro-Ambrosetti, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho &amp; DeCastro-Ambrosetti|first=|date=2005|title=Is ignorance bliss? Pre-service teachers' attitudes toward multicultural education|url=|journal=The High School Journal|volume=89|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pre-service teachers can still feel hesitant because of the lack of knowledge they still hold about multiculturalism, which can encourage further courses intended to educate teachers on the variety of cultures their students may possess.

==Challenges==
===Lack of a definition of culture===

Many educators may think that when holding cultural parties, listening to music, or sampling foods related to different cultures that they are sufficiently promoting multiculturalism, but Fullinwider suggests these activities fail to address the deeper values and ideas behind cultural customs through which true understanding is reached (Fullinwider, 2005), and Levinson adds that such practices could lead to "trivializing real differences; teachers end up teaching or emphasizing superficial differences in order to get at fundamental similarities"&lt;ref name="Levinson, M. 2009"/&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;443. Fullinwider also discusses challenges which could arise in multicultural education when teachers from the majority culture begin to delve into these deeper issues. For example, when majority teachers interact with minority students, the distinction between "high culture" and "home culture" needs to be clear or else faculty and staff members could mistakenly withdraw their rightful authority to evaluate and discipline students' conduct and quality of work (Fullinwider, 2005). To clarify, without a clear understanding of true culture, educators could easily misattribute detrimental conduct or sub-par behavior to a minority student's cultural background (Fullinwider, 2005) or misinterpret signs that a student may require out-of-school intervention. Both would result in the student not receiving a fitting and appropriate education.

===Different ways it ignores minority students===
Multicultural education in classroom settings has been a hidden factor that affects students with a diverse culture. Although multicultural education has positive approaches on helping students, there are ways in which it does not fully benefit all of those who need it.are several factors on how it does positively influence all students. For example, "It generally it ignores the minority students' own responsibility for their academic performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogbu|first=John|date=March 2016|title=Understanding Cultural Diversity and Learning|url=|journal=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are seen as being self caretakers for their own education meaning they are the ones to held responsible for their consequences, even if it results on affecting the student even more. A second factor is "multicultural education theories and programs are rarely based on the actual study of minority cultures and languages." The idea of multicultural education has increasingly been noted that it lacks the exploration of minority communities yet in the actual school environment exploration of minority children/students has occurred. Lastly, "The inadequacy of the multicultural education solution fails to separate minority groups that are able to cross cultural and language boundaries and learn successfully even though there were initial cultural barriers." In other words, students who belong to minority groups and are able to excel are left in the same classroom setting with those who are struggling. These factors shows how multicultural education has positive intentions but in the societal spectrum it lacks aspects that are crucial for the development of minority students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogbu|first=John|last2=Simmons|date=March 2016|title=Voluntary and Involuntary Minorities: A Cultural-Ecological Theory of School Performance with Some Implications for Education|url=|journal=Anthropology and Education Quarterly|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In-school application===

Levinson notes that tenets of multicultural education have the potential to conflict directly with the purposes of educating in the dominant culture and some tenants conflict with each other.&lt;ref name="Levinson, M. 2009"/&gt; One can observe this tug of war in the instance of whether multicultural education should be inclusive versus exclusive. Levinson argues that a facet of multicultural education (i.e.-preserving the minority culture) would require teaching only the beliefs of this culture while excluding others.&lt;ref name="Levinson, M. 2009"/&gt; In this way, one can see how an exclusive curriculum would leave other cultures left out. Levinson also brings up, similar to Fullinwider, the conflict between minority group preservation and social justice and equity.&lt;ref name="Levinson, M. 2009"/&gt; Many cultures, for example, favor power in the hands of men instead of women and even mistreat women in what is a culturally appropriate manner for them. When educators help to preserve this type of culture, they can also be seen encouraging the preservation of gender and other inequalities.&lt;ref name="Levinson, M. 2009"/&gt;

Similar to the inclusive versus exclusive education debate, Levinson goes as far to suggest segregated schools to teach minority students in order to achieve a "culturally congruent"1 education. She argues that in a homogeneous class it is easier to change curriculum and practices to suit the culture of the students so that they can have equal educational opportunities and status in the culture and life of the school. Thus, when considering multicultural education to include teaching in a culturally congruent manner, Levinson supports segregated classrooms to aid in the success of this. Segregation, as she admits, blatantly goes against multiculturalism thus highlighting the inner conflicts that this ideology presents.

Another challenge to multicultural education is that the extent of multicultural content integration in a given school tends to be related to the ethnic composition of the student body. That is, as Agirdag and colleagues have shown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agirdag|first1=O.|last2=Merry|first2=M. S.|last3=Van Houtte|first3=M.|title=Teachers' Understanding of Multicultural Education and the Correlates of Multicultural Content Integration in Flanders|journal=Education and Urban Society|date=2 June 2014|doi=10.1177/0013124514536610}}&lt;/ref&gt; teachers tend to incorporate more multicultural educational in schools with a higher share of ethnic minority students. However, there is no fundamental reason why only schools with ethnic minority pupils should focus on multicultural education. On the contrary, in particular there is a need for White students, who are largely separated from their ethnic minority peers in White-segregated schools, to become more familiar with ethnic diversity. While ethnic minority students learn in many contexts about the mainstream society in which they live, for White students the school context might be the only places where they can have meaningful encounters with ethnic and religious others.

===School culture===

Banks (2005) poses challenges that can occur at the systemic level of schools. First, it is noted that schools must rely on teachers' personal beliefs or a willingness to allow for their personal beliefs to be altered in order for multicultural education to truly be effective within classrooms. Second it requires for schools and teachers to knowledge that there is a blatant curriculum as well as a latent curriculum that operates within each school; with latent curriculum being the norms of the school that are not necessarily articulated but are understood and expected by all. Third schools must rely on teachers to teach towards students becoming global citizen which again, relies on teachers' willing to embrace other cultures in order to be able to convey to and open-mindedness to their students.

Fullinwider also brings to light the challenge of whether or not teachers believe and the effectiveness of a multicultural education. More specifically, he points out that teachers may fear bringing up matter within multicultural education that could truly be effective because said matters could be equally effective and potentially harmful (Fullinwider 2005). For example, discussing history between races and ethnic groups could help students to view different perspectives and foster understanding amongst groups or such a lesson could cause further division within the classroom and create a hostile environment for students.

{{Mythology}}
'''Myth''' is a [[folklore genre]] consisting of narratives that play a fundamental role in society, such as foundational tales.  The main characters in myths are usually [[gods]], [[demigod]]s or [[supernatural]] humans.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"&gt;"myths", ''A Dictionary of English Folklore''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = oflaherty&gt;{{cite book|last =Doniger O'Flaherty|first = Wendy|quote =I think it can be well argued as a matter of principle that, just as 'biography is about chaps', so mythology is about gods.|page = 19|title = Hindu Myths|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Af7TFlN5hmsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date =1975|publisher = Penguin|isbn = 9780140443066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myths are often endorsed by rulers and priests and are closely linked to [[religion]] or spirituality.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}} In fact, many societies group their myths, legends and history together, considering myths to be true accounts of their remote past.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"/&gt;{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 23}}{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1984|p= 102}} [[Creation myth]]s particularly, take place in a primordial age when the world had not achieved its later form.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}{{sfn|Dundes|1984|p= 1}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 6}} Other myths explain how a society's [[norm (social)|customs]], [[institution]]s and [[taboo]]s were established and sanctified.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 6}} There is a complex relationship between [[myth and ritual|recital of myths and enactment of rituals]].

The study of myth began in [[ancient history]]. Rival classes of the [[Greek myths]] by [[Euhemerus]], [[Plato]] and [[Sallustius]] were developed by the [[Neoplatonists]] and later revived by [[Renaissance]] mythographers. Today, the study of myth continues in a wide variety of academic fields, including [[folklore studies]], [[philology]], and [[psychology]]. The term '''mythology''' may either refer to the study of myths in general, or a body of myths regarding a particular subject. The academic comparisons of bodies of myth is known as [[comparative mythology]].

===''Myth''===
Definitions of ''myth'' to some extent vary by scholar. Finnish [[folklore studies|folklorist]] Lauri Honko offers a widely cited definition:
{{quote|Myth, a story of the gods, a religious account of the [[cosmogony|beginning of the world]], the [[creation myth|creation]], fundamental events, the exemplary deeds of the gods as a result of which the world, nature and culture were created together with all parts thereof and given their order, which still obtains. A myth expresses and confirms society's religious values and norms, it provides a pattern of behavior to be imitated, testifies to the efficacy of [[ritual]] with its practical ends and establishes the sanctity of [[cult]].&lt;REF NAME="HONKO-1984"&gt;{{cite book|last =Honko|first = Lauri|date = 1984 |chapter =The Problem of Defining Myth|editorlink=Alan Dundes|editor-first = Alan|editor-last = Dundes|title =Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth|page = 49|publisher = [[University of California Press]]|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l5Om2ALAFbEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars in other fields use the term ''myth'' in varied ways.{{sfn|Dundes|1984|p=147}}{{sfn|Doty|2004|pp= 11–12}}{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 5}} In a broad sense, the word can refer to any [[traditional story]],{{sfn|Kirk|1984|p=57}}{{sfn|Kirk|1973|p= 74}}{{sfn|Apollodorus|1976|p= 3}} [[popular misconception]] or [[imagination|imaginary]] entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Collegiate Dictionary|chapter=myth|page=770|edition=10th|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]], Inc|location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while myth and other folklore genres may overlap, myth is often thought to differ from genres such as [[legend]] and [[Folklore genre|folktale]] in that neither are considered to be sacred narratives.&lt;ref name="SALAMON-GOLDBERG-2012"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qhsdhM9tI3EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last1 =Salamon|first1=  Hagar |first2= Harvey E.|last2= Goldberg|date = 2012|chapter =Myth-Ritual-Symbol|editor1-first= Regina F.|editor1-last= Bendix |editor2-first= Galit|editor2-last= Hasan-Rokem |title = A Companion to Folklore|page = 125|publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 7}} Some kinds of folktales, such as [[fairy stories]], are not considered true by anyone, and may be seen as distinct from myths for this reason.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9, 17}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 10–11}}{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1984|pp= 99–101}} Main characters in myths are usually [[gods]], [[demigod]]s or [[supernatural]] humans,{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"&gt;"myths", ''A Dictionary of English Folklore''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oflaherty" /&gt; while legends generally feature humans as their main characters.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}} However, many exceptions or combinations exist, as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]''.{{sfn|Kirk|1973|pp=22, 32}}{{sfn|Kirk|1984|p= 55}} Moreover, as stories spread between cultures or as faiths change, myths can come to be considered folktales, their divine characters recast as either as humans or demihumans such as [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], [[elf|elves]] and [[faerie]]s.&lt;ref name="mythfolk"/&gt;{{sfn|Doty|2004|p=114}}{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 13}} Conversely, historical and literary material may acquire mythological qualities over time. For example, the [[Matter of Britain]] (the legendary history of Great Britain, especially those focused on [[King Arthur]] and [[Round Table|the knights of the Round Table]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/romance-literature-and-performance#toc50951|title=romance {{!}} literature and performance|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Matter of France]], seem distantly to originate in historical events of the fifth and eighth-centuries respectively, and became mythologised over the following centuries.

In colloquial use, the word ''myth'' can also be used of a collectively held belief that has no basis in fact, or any false story.&lt;ref&gt;"myth, n., §2" OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/124670. Accessed 23 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This usage, which is often [[pejorative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howells|first=Richard|title=The Myth of the Titanic|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34BdSTbnSKUC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=myth+pejorative&amp;source=web&amp;ots=X4AT1P_6XR&amp;sig=3UkHYLBt7fQrRDjP4ZOOtQzbBfA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result}}&lt;/ref&gt; arose from labeling the religious myths and beliefs of other cultures as incorrect, but it has spread to cover non-religious beliefs as well.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967, pp. 23, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as commonly used by [[folklore studies|folklorists]] and academics in other relevant fields, such as [[anthropology]], the term ''myth'' has no implication whether the narrative may be understood as true or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Winzeler, Robert L. (2012) ''Anthropology and Religion: What We Know, Think, and Question'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the term ''myth'' is widely used to imply that a story is not [[objective truth|objectively true]], the identification of a narrative as a myth can be highly political: many adherents of religions view their religion's stories as [[truth|true]] and therefore object to the stories being characterised as myths. Nevertheless, scholars now routinely speak of [[Christian mythology]], [[Jewish mythology]], [[Islamic mythology]], [[Hindu mythology]], and so forth. Traditionally, Western scholarship, with its Judaeo-Christian heritage, has viewed narratives in the [[Abrahamic religions]] as being the province of [[theology]] rather than mythology; meanwhile, identifying religious stories of colonised cultures, such as stories in [[Hinduism]], as myths enabled Western scholars to imply that they were of lower truth-value than the stories of [[Christianity]]. Labelling all religious narratives as ''myths'' can be thought of as treating different traditions with parity.&lt;ref name=leeming=preface&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|title=Preface|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR7|page=vii|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2005|author=David Leeming}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mythology''===
In present use, ''mythology'' usually refers to the collected myths of a group of people, but may also mean the study of such myths.{{sfn|Kirk|1973|p=8}} For example, [[Greek mythology]], [[Roman mythology]] and [[Hittite mythology]] all describe the body of myths retold among those cultures. Folklorist [[Alan Dundes]] defines myth as a [[sacred]] [[narrative]] that explains how the world and humanity evolved into their present form. Dundes classified a sacred narrative as "a story that serves to define the fundamental worldview of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society".&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt; Anthropologist [[Bruce Lincoln]] defines ''myth'' as "ideology in narrative form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lincoln |first= Bruce |year= 2006 |title= An Early Moment in the Discourse of "Terrorism": Reflections on a Tale from Marco Polo |jstor= 3879351 |journal= [[Comparative Studies in Society and History]] |volume= 48 |issue= 2 |pages= 242–259 |quote= More precisely, mythic discourse deals in master categories that have multiple referents: levels of the cosmos, terrestrial geographies, plant and animal species, logical categories, and the like.

===''Mythography''===
The compilation or description of myths is sometimes known as ''mythography'', a term which can also be used of a scholarly anthology of myths (or, confusingly, of the study of myths generally).&lt;ref&gt;"mythography, n." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018, https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124691. Accessed 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Key mythographers in the Classical tradition include [[Ovid]] (43 BCE–17/18 CE), whose tellings of myths have been profoundingly influential; [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius]], a Latin writer of the late fifth to early sixth centuries, whose ''Mythologies'' (Latin: ''Mitologiarum libri III'') gathered and gave moralistic interpretations of a wide range of myths; the anonymous medieval [[Vatican Mythographers]], who developed anthologies of Classical myths that remained influential to the end of the Middle Ages; and the Renaissance scholar [[Natalis Comes]], whose ten-book ''Mythologiae'' became a standard source for classical mythology in later Renaissance Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', 2 vols (Gainesville, 1994–2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent mythographies include the thirteenth-century ''[[Prose Edda]]'' attributed to the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]], which is the main surviving survey of [[Norse Mythology]] from the Middle Ages.

===''Mythos''===
Because ''myth'' is sometimes used in a pejorative sense, some scholars have opted to use the term ''mythos'' instead.&lt;ref name=grassie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grassie |first1=William |date=March 1998 |title=Science as Epic? Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time? |journal=Science &amp; Spirit |volume=9 |issue=1 |quote=The word 'myth' is popularly understood to mean idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood; but there is another meaning of the word in academic discourse .... Using the original Greek term ''mythos'' is perhaps a better way to distinguish this more positive and all-encompassing definition of the word.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''mythos'' now more commonly refers to its [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotelian]] sense as a "plot point" or to 'a body of interconnected myths or stories, esp[ecially] those belonging to a particular religious or cultural tradition'.&lt;ref name=oedmthos&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', {{nowrap|3rd ed.}} "mythos, ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used specifically for modern, fictional mythologies, such as the [[worldbuilding|world building]] of [[H.P. Lovecraft]].

===''Mythopoeia''===
{{main|Mythopoeia}}
"Conscious generation" of mythology was termed ''mythopoeia'' by, amongst others, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/235084 mythopoeia, n.]" ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018. Accessed 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Mythopoeia (poem)]]; cf. J.R.R. Tolkien, ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JW-cQ-cypwwC Tree and Leaf; Mythopoeia; The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son]'' (London: HarperCollins, 2001) [first published 1964] {{ISBN|9780007105045}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was notoriously also suggested, separately, by Nazi ideologist [[Alfred Rosenberg]].

==Origins of the terms ''myth'' and ''mythology''==
[[File:Francesco Hayez 028.jpg|thumb|''Odysseus Overcome by Demodocus' Song'', by Francesco Hayez, 1813–15]]
The word ''myth'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] ''μῦθος'' [''mȳthos''], meaning 'speech, narrative, fiction, myth, plot'. In Anglicised form, this Greek word began to be used in English (and was likewise adapted into other European languages) in the early nineteenth century, in a much narrower sense, as a scholarly term for 'a traditional story, typically involving supernatural beings or forces, which embodies and provides an explanation, aetiology, or justification for something such as the early history of a society, a religious belief or ritual, or a natural phenomenon'.&lt;ref name =mythmythos&gt;"[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124670 myth, n.]", "[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124705 mythos, n.]" ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018. Accessed 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|μυθολογία}} [''mythología''] ("story," "lore," "legends," "the telling of stories") combines the word ''mȳthos'' with the suffix -''λογία'' [''-logia''] ("study"), and meant 'romance, fiction, story-telling'.&lt;ref name="oedlogy"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', {{nowrap|1st ed.}} "-logy, ''comb. form''". Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, [[Plato]] used ''mythología'' as a general term for "fiction" or "story-telling" of any kind.

The Greek term ''mythología'' was then borrowed into [[Latin language|Latin]]. [[Late Latin]] ''mythologia'', which occurs in the title of Latin author [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]]' fifth-century ''Mythologiæ'', denoted the explication of Greek and Roman stories about their gods, which we now call [[classical mythology]]. Fulgentius's ''Mythologiæ'' explicitly treated its subject matter as [[allegory|allegories]] requiring interpretation and not as true events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Fabius Planciades |last=Fulgentius|title=Fulgentius the Mythographer|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=73mJIuYfmzEC}}|year=1971|publisher=Ohio State University Press|isbn=978-0-8142-0162-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term was then adopted in [[Middle French]] as ''mythologie''. Whether from French or Latin usage, English adopted the word "mythology" in the fifteenth century, at first in the sense 'the exposition of a myth or myths; the interpretation of fables; a book of such expositions'. The word is first attested in [[John Lydgate]]'s ''[[Troy Book]]'' of c. 1425.&lt;ref name=oedmlogy&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed.

From Lydgate until the seventeenth or eighteenth-century, ''mythology'' was used to mean a [[moral]], [[fable]], [[allegory]] or a [[parable]], or collection of traditional stories,&lt;ref name="oedmlogy" /&gt;{{refn|All which [''sc.''

===Meanings in Ancient Greece===
The term μῦθος (''mythos'') appears in the works of [[Homer]] and other poets of Homer's era.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson (2004), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In these works, the term had several meanings: conversation, narrative, speech, story, tale, and word.

Like the related term λόγος (''[[logos]]''), ''mythos'' expresses whatever can be delivered in the form of words; these can be contrasted with  ἔργον (''ergon''), a Greek term for action, deed, and work.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The term ''mythos'' lacks an explicit distinction between true or false narratives.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

In the context of the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the term ''mythos'' referred to the myth, the narrative, the plot, and the story of a play.&lt;ref name="Wiles"&gt;Wiles (2000), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Wiles, the Greek term ''mythos'' in this era covered an entire spectrum of different meanings, from undeniable falsehoods to stories with religious and symbolic significance.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt;

According to philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE), the spirit of a theatrical play was its ''mythos''.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; The term ''mythos'' was also used for the source material of [[Greek tragedy]]. The tragedians of the era could draw inspiration from [[Greek mythology]], a body of "traditional storylines" which concerned [[Deity|gods]] and [[hero]]es.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; David Wiles observes that modern conceptions about Greek tragedy can be misleading. It is commonly thought that the ancient audience members were already familiar with the ''mythos'' behind a play, and could predict the outcome of the play. However, the Greek dramatists were not expected to faithfully reproduce traditional myths when [[Theatrical adaptation|adapting them for the stage]]. They were instead recreating the myths and producing new versions.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; Storytellers like [[Euripides]] (c. 480–406 BCE) relied on [[suspense]] to excite their audiences. In one of his works, [[Merope (Messenia)|Merope]] attempts to kill her son's murderer with an axe, unaware that the man in question is actually her son. According to an ancient description of audience reactions to this work, the audience members were genuinely unsure of whether she would commit [[filicide]] or she will be stopped in time. They rose to their feet in terror and caused an uproar.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt;

David Wiles points that the traditional ''mythos'' of Ancient Greece, was primarily a part of its [[oral tradition]]. The [[Greeks]] of this era were a literate culture, but produced no [[Religious text|sacred texts]]. There were no definitive or authoritative versions of myths recorded in texts and preserved forever in an unchanging form.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"&gt;Wiles (2000), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Instead multiple variants of myths were in circulation. These variants were adapted into songs, dances, poetry, and visual art. Performers of myths could freely reshape their source material for a new work, adapting it to the needs of a new audience or in response to a new situation.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"/&gt;

Children in Ancient Greece were familiar with traditional myths from an early age. According to the philosopher [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BCE), mothers and [[nursemaid]]s narrated myths and stories to the children in their charge: David Wiles describes them as a repository of mythological lore.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"/&gt;

[[Bruce Lincoln]] has called attention to the apparent meaning of the terms ''mythos'' and ''logos'' in the works of [[Hesiod]]. In ''[[Theogony]]'', Hesiod attributes to the [[Muse]]s the ability to both proclaim truths and narrate plausible falsehoods (falsehoods which seem like real things).&lt;ref name="Lincoln"&gt;Lincoln (1999), pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt; The verb used for narrating the falsehoods in the text is ''legein'', which is etymologically associated with ''logos''. There are two variants in the manuscript tradition for the verb used to proclaim truths. One variant uses ''gerusasthai'', the other ''mythesasthai''. The latter is a form of the verb ''mytheomai'' (to speak, to tell), which is etymologically associated with ''mythos''.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; In the ''[[Works and Days]]'', Hesiod describes his dispute with his brother Perses. He also announces to his readers his intention to tell true things to his brother. The verb he uses for telling the truth is ''mythesaimen'', another form of ''mytheomai''.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt;

Lincoln draws the conclusion that Hesiod associated the "speech of ''mythos''" (as Lincoln calls it) with telling the [[truth]]. While he associated the "speech of ''logos''" with telling [[lie]]s, and hiding one's true thoughts (dissimulation).&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; This conclusion is strengthened by the use of the plural term ''logoi'' (the plural form of ''logos'') elsewhere in Hesiod's works. Three times the term is associated with the term "[[seduction|seductive]]" and three times with the term "falsehoods".&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; In his genealogy of the gods, Hesiod lists ''logoi'' among the children of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess personifying strife. Eris' children are ominous figures, which personify various physical and verbal forms of conflict.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt;

==Interpreting myths==

===Comparative mythology===
{{Main article|Comparative mythology}}
Comparative mythology is the systematic comparison of myths from different cultures. It seeks to discover underlying themes that are common to the myths of multiple cultures. In some cases, comparative mythologists use the similarities between separate mythologies to argue that those mythologies have a common source. This source may inspire myths or provide a common "protomythology" that diverged into the mythologies of each culture.{{sfn|Littleton|1973|p=32}}

===Functionalism===
A number of commentators have argued that myths function to form and shape society and social behaviour. [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] argued that one of the foremost functions of myth is to establish models for behavior{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 8}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 51}} and that myths may provide a religious experience. By telling or reenacting myths, members of traditional societies detach themselves from the present, returning to the mythical age, thereby coming closer to the divine.{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 23}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 51}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 19}}

[[Lauri Honko|Honko]] asserted that, in some cases, a society reenacts a myth in an attempt to reproduce the conditions of the mythical age. For example, it might reenact the healing performed by a god at the beginning of time in order to heal someone in the present.&lt;REF NAME="HONKO-1984"/&gt; Similarly, [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]] argued that modern culture explores religious experience. Since it is not the job of science to define human morality, a religious experience is an attempt to connect with a perceived moral past, which is in contrast with the technological present.{{sfn|Barthes|1972}}

[[Devdutt Pattanaik|Pattanaik]] defines mythology as "a subjective truth of people that is communicated through stories, symbols and rituals". He adds, "unlike fantasy that is nobody’s truth, and history that seeks to be everybody’s truth, mythology is somebody’s truth."&lt;ref name="PD2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/why-i-insist-on-calling-myself-a-mythologist|title=Why I Insist On Calling Myself A Mythologist|last=Pattanaik|first=Devdutt|date=14 September 2015|website=Swarajya|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euhemerism===
{{Main article|Euhemerism}}
{{See also|Herodotus}}
One theory claims that myths are distorted accounts of historical events.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} According to this theory, storytellers repeatedly elaborate upon historical accounts until the figures in those accounts gain the status of gods.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} For example, the myth of the wind-god [[Aeolus]] may have evolved from a historical account of a king who taught his people to use sails and interpret the winds.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}} [[Herodotus]] (fifth-century BCE) and [[Prodicus]] made claims of this kind.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} This theory is named ''[[euhemerism]]'' after mythologist [[Euhemerus]] (c. 320 BCE), who suggested that Greek gods developed from legends about human beings.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}}&lt;ref&gt;"Euhemerism", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegory===
Some theories propose that myths began as allegories for natural phenomena: [[Apollo]] represents the sun, [[Poseidon]] represents water, and so on.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} According to another theory, myths began as allegories for philosophical or spiritual concepts: [[Athena]] represents wise judgment, [[Aphrodite]] desire, and so on.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} [[Max Müller|Müller]] supported an allegorical theory of myth. He believed myths began as allegorical descriptions of nature and gradually came to be interpreted literally. For example, a poetic description of the sea as "raging" was eventually taken literally and the sea was then thought of as a raging god.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 20}}

===Personification===
{{See also|Mythopoeic thought}}
Some thinkers claimed that myths result from the [[Anthropomorphism|personification]] of objects and forces. According to these thinkers, the ancients worshiped natural phenomena, such as fire and air, gradually deifying them.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 195}} For example, according to this theory, ancients tended to view things as gods, not as mere objects.{{sfn|Frankfort|Frankfort|Wilson|Jacobsen|2013|p= 4}} Thus, they described natural events as acts of personal gods, giving rise to myths.{{sfn|Frankfort|Frankfort|Wilson|Jacobsen|2013|p= 15}}

===Myth-ritual theory===
{{See also|Myth and ritual}}
According to the myth-ritual theory, myth is tied to ritual.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 61}} In its most extreme form, this theory claims myths arose to explain rituals.{{sfn|Graf|1996|p= 40}} This claim was first put forward by [[William Robertson Smith|Smith]],{{sfn|Meletinsky|2014| pp=19–20}} who argued that people begin performing rituals for reasons not related to myth. Forgetting the original reason for a ritual, they account for it by inventing a myth and claiming the ritual commemorates the events described in that myth.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 63}} [[James Frazer|Frazer]] claimed that humans started out with a belief in magical rituals; later, they began to lose faith in magic and invented myths about gods, reinterpreting their rituals as religious rituals intended to appease the gods.{{sfn|Frazer|1913|p= 711}}

==History of the academic discipline==
Historically, important approaches to the study of mythology have included those of [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Schiller]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], [[Freud]], [[Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Lévi-Strauss]], [[Northrop Frye|Frye]], the Soviet school, and the [[Myth and Ritual School]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Lanoue, Foreword to Meletinsky, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Myths and legends of Babylonia and Assyria (1916) (14801987593).jpg|thumb|right|''Myths and legends of [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]]'' (1916)]]
The critical interpretation of myth began with the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Presocratics]].{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 1}} Euhemerus was one of the most important pre-modern mythologists. He interpreted myths as accounts of actual historical events – distorted over many retellings. Sallustius&lt;ref&gt;On the Gods and the World, ch. 5, See Collected Writings on the Gods and the World, The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; divided myths into five categories – theological, physical (or concerning natural laws), animistic (or concerning soul), material, and mixed. Mixed concerns myths that show the interaction between two or more of the previous categories and are particularly used in initiations.

Plato famously condemned poetic myth when discussing education in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]].'' His critique was primarily on the grounds that the uneducated might take the stories of gods and heroes literally. Nevertheless, he constantly referred to myths throughout his writings. As [[Platonism]] developed in the phases commonly called [[Middle Platonism]] and [[neoplatonism]], writers such as [[Plutarch]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]], [[Olympiodorus the younger|Olympiodorus,]] and [[Damascius]] wrote explicitly about the symbolic interpretation of traditional and Orphic myths.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the most extended passage of philosophic interpretation of myth is to be found in the fifth and sixth essays of Proclus’ ''Commentary on the Republic'' (to be found in ''The Works of Plato I'', trans. Thomas Taylor, The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1996); Porphyry’s analysis of the Homeric Cave of the Nymphs is another important work in this area (''Select Works of Porphyry'', Thomas Taylor The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1994). See the external links below for a full English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mythological themes were consciously employed in literature, beginning with [[Homer]]. The resulting work may expressly refer to a mythological background without itself becoming part of a body of myths ([[Cupid and Psyche]]). Medieval romance in particular plays with this process of turning myth into literature. ''Euhemerism'', as stated earlier, refers to the rationalization of myths, putting themes formerly imbued with mythological qualities into pragmatic contexts. An example of this would be following a cultural or religious paradigm shift (notably the re-interpretation of [[Paganism|pagan]] mythology following [[Christianization]]).

===European Renaissance===
[[File:Bartolomeo di Giovanni - The Myth of Io - Walters 37421.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=The ancient Roman poet Ovid, in his "The Metamorphoses," told the story of the nymph Io who was seduced by Jupiter, the king of the gods.

Interest in polytheistic mythology revived during the [[Renaissance]], with early works of mythography appearing in the sixteenth century, among them the ''[[Theologia mythologica|Theologia Mythologica]]'' (1532).

===Nineteenth century===
The first modern, Western scholarly theories of myth appeared during the second half of the nineteenth century{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 1}} — at the same time as the word ''myth'' was adopted as a scholarly term in European languages.&lt;ref name="mythmythos" /&gt; They were driven partly by a new interest in Europe's ancient past and [[vernacular]] culture, associated with [[Romantic Nationalism]] and epitomised by the research of [[Jacob Grimm]] (1785–1863). This movement drew European scholars' attention not only to Classical myths, but also material now associated with [[Norse mythology]], [[Finnish mythology]], and so forth. Western theories were also partly driven by Europeans' efforts to comprehend and control the cultures, stories and religions they were encountering through [[colonialism]]. These encounters included both extremely old texts such as the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''[[Rigveda]]'' and the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', and current oral narratives such as [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]] or stories told in [[traditional African religions]].&lt;ref name = shippey&gt;Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in ''The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous'', ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1–28 (esp. pp. 4–13).&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual context for nineteenth-century scholars was profoundly shaped by emerging ideas about [[evolution]]. These ideas included the recognition that many Eurasian languages—and therefore, conceivably, stories—were all descended from a lost common ancestor (the [[Indo-European language]]) which could rationally be reconstructed through the comparison of its descendant languages. They also included the idea that [[Cultural evolution|cultures might evolve]] in ways comparable to species.&lt;ref name = shippey/&gt; In general, nineteenth-century theories framed myth as a failed or obsolete mode of thought, often by interpreting myth as the primitive counterpart of modern science within a [[Unilineal evolution|unilineal]] framework that imagined that human cultures are travelling, at different speeds, along a linear path of cultural development.{{sfn|Segal|2015|pp= 3–4}}

One of the dominant mythological theories of the later nineteenth century was "nature mythology", whose foremost exponents included [[Max Müller]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]. This theory posited that "primitive man" was primarily concerned with the natural world. It tended to interpret myths that seemed distasteful European Victorians—for example tales about sex, incest, or cannibalism—as being metaphors for natural phenomena like agricultural fertility.&lt;ref&gt;John McKinnell, ''Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 2005), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to conceive impersonal natural laws, early humans tried to explain natural phenomena by attributing souls to inanimate objects, giving rise to [[animism]]. According to Tylor, human thought evolved through stages, starting with mythological ideas and gradually progressing to scientific ideas.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 4}} Müller also saw myth arising from language, even calling myth a "disease of language". He speculated that myths arose due to the lack of abstract nouns and neuter gender in ancient languages. Anthropomorphic figures of speech, necessary in such languages, were eventually taken literally, leading to the idea that natural phenomena were in actuality conscious beings or gods.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 20}} Not all scholars, not even all nineteenth-century scholars, accepted this view. [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] claimed "the primitive mentality is a condition of the human mind, and not a stage in its historical development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mâche|title=Music, Myth and Nature, or The Dolphins of Arion| year=1992| page= 8 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YNCVOY423HsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first = Francois-Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship, noting the fundamental lack of evidence for "nature mythology" interpretations among people who actually circulated myths, has likewise abandoned the key ideas of "nature mythology".&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Dorson, 'The Eclipse of Solar Mythology', in ''Myth: A Symposium'', ed. by Thomas A. Sebeok (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1955), 25–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John McKinnell, ''Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 2005), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James George Frazer]] saw myths as a misinterpretation of magical rituals, which were themselves based on a mistaken idea of natural law: this idea was central to the "[[myth and ritual]]" school of thought.{{sfn|Segal|2015|pp= 67–68}} According to Frazer, humans begin with an unfounded belief in impersonal magical laws. When they realize applications of these laws do not work, they give up their belief in natural law in favor of a belief in personal gods controlling nature, thus giving rise to religious myths. Meanwhile, humans continue practicing formerly magical rituals through force of habit, reinterpreting them as reenactments of mythical events. Finally humans come to realize nature follows natural laws, and they discover their true nature through science. Here again, science makes myth obsolete as humans progress "from magic through religion to science."{{sfn|Frazer|1913|p= 711}}

Segal asserted that by pitting mythical thought against modern scientific thought, such theories imply modern humans must abandon myth.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 3}}

===Twentieth century===
[[File:Prometheus by Gustave Moreau.jpg|thumb|''[[Prometheus]]'' (1868) by [[Gustave Moreau]]. In the mythos of [[Hesiodus]] and possibly [[Aeschylus]] (the [[Greek mythos|Greek]] trilogy ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' and ''[[Prometheus Pyrphoros]]''), Prometheus is bound and tortured for giving fire to humanity]]

The earlier twentieth century saw major work developing [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] approaches to interpreting myth, led by [[Sigmund Freud]], who, drawing inspiration from Classical myth, began developing the concept of the [[Oedipus complex]] in his 1899 ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''. [[Carl Jung|Jung]] likwise tried to understand the psychology behind world myths. Jung asserted that all humans share certain innate unconscious psychological forces, which he called ''[[archetypes]]''. He believed similarities between the myths of different cultures reveals the existence of these universal archetypes.&lt;ref&gt;Boeree.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-twentieth century saw the influential development of a [[structuralist theory of mythology]], led by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]. Strauss argued that myths reflect patterns in the mind and interpreted those patterns more as fixed mental structures, specifically pairs of opposites (good/evil, compassionate/callous), rather than unconscious feelings or urges.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 113}} Meanwhile, [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] developed analyses of myths focusing on their social functions in the real world. He is associated with the idea that myths such as [[Origin myth|origin stories]] might provide a "mythic charter"—a legitimisation—for cultural norms and social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Birenbaum, ''Myth and Mind'' (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1988), pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, following the Structuralist Era (roughly the 1960s to 1980s), the predominant anthropological and sociological approaches to myth increasingly treated myth as a form of narrative that can be studied, interpreted and analyzed like ideology, history and culture. In other words, myth is a form of understanding and telling stories that is connected to power, political structures, and political and economic interests. These approaches contrast with approaches such as those of Campbell and Eliade that hold that myth has some type of essential connection to ultimate sacred meanings that transcend cultural specifics. In particular, myth was studied in relation to history from diverse social sciences. Most of these studies share the assumption that history and myth are not distinct in the sense that history is factual, real, accurate, and truth, while myth is the opposite.

In the 1950s, Barthes published a series of essays examining modern myths and the process of their creation in his book ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', which stood as an early work in the emerging [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] approach to mythology, which recognised myths' existence in the modern world and in [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wsGDVdYoRA4C&amp;dq=Barthes+Mythologies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKp_nv8q_cAhWlF5oKHSWQB6oQ6AEIJDAA|title = Mythologies|date = 1972|publisher = Hill and Wang|last = Barthes|first = Roland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth century saw rapid [[secularisation]] in Western culture. This made Western scholars more willing to analyse narratives in the [[Abrahamic religions]] as myths; theologians such as [[Rudolf Bultmann]] argued that a modern Christianity needed to [[Demythologization|demythologize]];&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Bultmann, ''Jesus Christ and Mythology'' (New York: Scribner, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; and other religious scholars embraced the idea that the mythical status of Abrahamic narratives was a legitimate feature of their importance.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 3}} This, in his appendix to ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', and in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] attributed modern humans’ anxieties to their rejection of myths and the sense of the sacred.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Christian theologian [[Conrad Hyers]] wrote that
{{quote|...myth today has come to have negative connotations which are the complete opposite of its meaning in a religious context... In a religious context, however, myths are storied vehicles of supreme truth, the most basic and important truths of all. By them people regulate and interpret their lives and find worth and purpose in their existence. Myths put one in touch with sacred realities, the fundamental sources of being, power, and truth. They are seen not only as being the opposite of error but also as being clearly distinguishable from stories told for entertainment and from the workaday, domestic, practical language of a people. They provide answers to the mysteries of being and becoming, mysteries which, as mysteries, are hidden, yet mysteries which are revealed through story and ritual. Myths deal not only with truth but with ultimate truth.{{sfn|Hyers|1984|p=107}}}}

===Twenty-first century===
Both in nineteenth-century research that tended to see existing records of stories and folklore as imperfect fragments of partially lost myths, and in twentieth-century structuralist work that sought to identify underlying patterns and structures in often diverse versions of a given myth, there had been a tendency to synthesise sources to attempt to reconstruct what scholars supposed to be more perfect or underlying forms of myths. From the late twentieth century, however, researchers influenced by [[postmodernism]] tended instead to argue that each account of a given myth has its own cultural significance and meaning, and argued that rather than representing degradation from a once more perfect form, myths are inherently plastic and variable.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. John McKinnell, ''Both One and Many: Essays on Change and Variety in Late Norse Heathenism'', Philologia: saggi, ricerche, edizioni a cura bi Teresa Pàroli, 1 (Rome, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; There is, consequently, no such thing as the 'original version' or 'original form' of a myth. One prominent example of this movement was [[A.K. Ramanujan]]'s essay ''[[Three Hundred Ramayanas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Ramanujan, ‘Three Hundred Rāmāyaṇas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation’, in ''[http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft3j49n8h7/ Many Rāmāyaṇas: The Diversity of a Narrative Tradition in South Asia]'', ed. by Paula Richman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), pp. 22–48; [http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf reprinted] in A.K. Ramanujan, ''The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 131–60, {{ISBN|9780195668964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondingly, scholars challenged the precedence that had once been given to texts as a medium for mythology, arguing that other media, such as the visual arts or even landscape and place-naming, could be as or more important.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ken Dowden, ''The Uses of Greek Mythology'' (London: Routledge, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern mythology==
[[File:10,000 Belgian francs of 1929 edited.jpg|thumb|left|1929 [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[banknote]], depicting [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[caduceus]]]]
In modern society, myth is often regarded as a collection of stories. Scholars in the field of [[cultural studies]] research how myth has worked itself into modern discourses. Mythological discourse can reach greater audiences than ever before via digital media. Various mythic elements appear in [[television]], [[Film|cinema]] and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/nctefiles/resources/journals/ej/1026-jul2013/ej1026exploring.pdf|title=Exploring the Boundaries of Narrative: Video Games in the English Classroom|last=Ostenson|first=Jonathan|date=2013|website=www2.ncte.org/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although myth was traditionally transmitted through the oral tradition on a small scale, the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cinematic Mythmaking: Philosophy in Film|last=Singer|first=Irving|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] psychology myths are the expression of a culture or society’s goals, fears, ambitions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Indick|first=William|date=November 18, 2004|title=Classical Heroes in Modern Movies: Mythological Patterns of the Superhero|url=|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of modern visual storytelling is rooted in the mythological tradition. Many contemporary films rely on ancient myths to construct narratives. [[The Walt Disney Company]] is well-known among cultural study scholars for "reinventing" traditional childhood myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Folklore Studies and Popular Film and Television: A Necessary Critical Survey|last=Koven|first=Michael|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=176–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many films are not as obvious as Disney fairy tales, the plots of many films are based on the rough structure of myths. Mythological archetypes, such as the cautionary tale regarding the abuse of technology, battles between gods and creation stories, are often the subject of major film productions. These films are often created under the guise of [[cyberpunk]] [[action film]]s, [[fantasy]], [[drama]]s and [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] tales.{{sfn|Corner|1999|pp=47–59}}

21st-century films such as ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', ''[[Immortals (2011 film)|Immortals]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' continue the trend of mining traditional mythology to frame modern plots. Authors use mythology as a basis for their books, such as [[Rick Riordan]], whose [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians|Percy Jackson and the Olympians]] series is situated in a modern-day world where the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek deities]] are manifest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/percy-jackson-problem|title=The Percy Jackson Problem|last=Mead|first=Rebecca|date=2014-10-22|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-11-06|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Newberry Library''' is an independent [[research library]], specializing in the [[humanities]] and located on [[Washington Square (Chicago)|Washington Square]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].  It has been free and open to the public since 1887. Its collections encompass a variety of topics related to the history and cultural production of [[Western Europe]] and the Americas over the last six centuries. The Library is named to honor the founding bequest from the estate of philanthropist [[Walter Loomis Newberry]].  Core collection strengths support research in several subject areas, including maps, travel, and exploration; music from the [[Renaissance]] to the early twentieth century; early contact between Western colonizers and Indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere; the personal papers of twentieth-century American journalists; the history of printing; and genealogy and local history.

Although the Newberry is a noncirculating library, it welcomes researchers into the reading rooms who are at least 14 years old or in the ninth grade,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagohistoryfair.org/research/resource-directory.html#n|title=Resource Directory|last=Administrator|website=www.chicagohistoryfair.org|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have a research topic corresponding to the nature of the collections. Additional public services are offered through exhibitions, meet-the-author lectures, adult education seminars, and other programming.

==History==
[[File:I Will 149C Newberry Library Chicago F.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Library from Washington Square on a c. 1910 postcard]]
The Newberry was established in 1887 as the result of a bequest by [[Walter Loomis Newberry]], an early Chicago resident and business leader involved in banking, shipping, real estate, and other commercial ventures. Newberry died at sea in 1868, while on a trip to France. He included in his will a provision of funds for the creation of a "free public library" should his daughters die without heirs. They did, and so, following the death of Newberry's widow, Julia Butler Newberry, in 1885, it was up to Newberry estate trustees William H. Bradley and Eliphalet W. Blatchford to bring the library to fruition.

Without much direction (Newberry did not leave behind many details regarding his vision for the library) and without its founder's personal collection as a foundation (Newberry's own collection of books perished in the [[Chicago fire of 1871|Great Fire of 1871]]), the first officers and staff members were instrumental in forming the character of the Newberry.

The Newberry's first librarian, [[William Frederick Poole]], was a major figure in the library world when he came to the Newberry. Poole saw the Newberry as a blank canvas on which he could project his ideas, which included and perhaps found their most impassioned articulation in the design and construction of libraries.  In 1887-88 it was located at 90 La Salle Street, in 1889-90 at 338 Ontario Street, and in 1890-93 at the northwest corner of State and Oak Streets. The present building, designed by Poole&lt;ref&gt;William Landram Williamson, "William Frederick Poole and the Modern Library Movement," Columbia University Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and architect [[Henry Ives Cobb]] (1859–1931), opened in 1893. It is located at 60 West Walton Street, across from [[Washington Square Park, Chicago|Washington Square]]. It is a structure in the Spanish Romanesque architectural style, built of Connecticut granite.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Newberry Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poole and Cobb feuded bitterly over their different visions for the library building. Poole favored a number of reading rooms with open shelving of materials that could be easily accessed by patrons; Cobb preferred the majestic grandiosity in vogue in Europe and the centralization of collection items. Poole's influence with the library's trustees coerced Cobb to temper the grand staircase he had envisioned and to accommodate open shelving. Over time, however, the open shelving would put too much strain on the Newberry's staff and the security of its collections, and the library would convert to a centralized storage system.

Poole served as Newberry librarian until his death in 1894. Under his leadership, the library built broad reference collections that would be useful to many different Chicagoans, especially professionals and tradespeople. The Newberry's medical department, created in 1890, is an example of this emphasis. Poole also steered the Newberry toward the acquisition of rare materials for use by professional scholars. Two ''en bloc'' acquisitions made during his tenure, the private collections of [[Henry Probasco]] and Count Pio Resse, yielded notable rarities in music and early printed specimens ([[incunables]]), as well as Shakespeare folios and editions of Homer, Dante, and Horace.

To focus its own collecting and to avoid the duplication of resources in Chicago at large, the Newberry entered into a cooperative agreement in 1896 with the [[Chicago Public Library]] and the [[John Crerar Library]], by which each institution would specialize in certain fields of knowledge and areas of service.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt; As a consequence, the Newberry came to specialize in the humanities, and the natural sciences became the province of the Crerar. The Newberry immediately transferred its holdings in this area, including its copy of Audubon's ''Birds of America''. The Newberry's medical department was transferred to the Crerar in 1906.&lt;ref name=ea3&gt;{{cite web|title=Cooperative Collecting in Chicago|url=http://publications.newberry.org/digitalexhibitions/exhibits/show/realizingthenewberryidea/acquireandpreserve/cooperative-collecting|website=Realizing the Newberry Idea|publisher=Newberry Library|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Pargellis]], the fifth Newberry librarian (1942–1962), emphasized not just the "passive" collection of materials but also the active orchestration of programs and events to encourage scholarly inquiries into the insights those materials might contain. Under Pargellis, a fellowship program was inaugurated and academic conferences were held at the Newberry, out of which emerged new scholarship using the library's collections.&lt;ref name=ea4&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pargellis |first=Stanley |date=October 4, 1943 |title=General Statement of Library Policy |journal=Minutes of the Newberry Board of Trustees}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pargellis also expanded the scope of the collection. Understanding the important role corporations played in American life and believing that those corporations could only be properly assessed if their records were freely accessible, Pargellis started a trend across the library world with the acquisition of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company's private archives. Since this acquisition, in 1943, the Newberry would continue to add to its CB&amp;Q archives, while collecting the records of other major corporations of the Midwest.

Between 1962 and 1986, the library was greatly expanded under the leadership of president Lawrence William "Bill" Towner. During this time, the Newberry acquired many important collections, a stacks building dedicated to the storage of collection items was constructed, and the library's four research centers were formed. The research centers continue to support and produce important scholarship in their fields, while providing programming for more general audiences. They are the Center for Renaissance Studies, the D'Arcy McNickle Center for American Indian and Indigenous Studies, the Hermon Dunlap Smith Center for the History of Cartography, and the William M. Scholl Center for American History and Culture.

[[David Spadafora]] has been the president of the Newberry since 2005.

[[Image:Washington Square Park &amp; Newberry Library.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Newberry from [[Washington Square Park, Chicago|Washington Square Park]]]]
The library houses more than 1.5 million books, 5 million manuscript pages, and 500,000 historic [[map]]s.  Collection strengths include materials on the European [[Renaissance]], [[genealogy]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], [[early music]], [[cartography]], the history of [[printing]], [[Chicago]] history, [[railroad]] archives, Luso-Brazilian history, and [[Midwestern]] authors' manuscripts.  The Newberry's Modern Manuscript Collection includes work by [[Royko|Mike Royko]], [[Elmo Scott Watson]], [[Ben Hecht]], [[Floyd Dell]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[John T. McCutcheon]], and [[Fanny Butcher]].  Among its most notable collection items are a Shakespeare [[First Folio]], correspondence from [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Oswald Bruce Cooper|Oswald Cooper's]] sketches for the Cooper Black typeface, original woodblocks made by [[Thomas Bewick]], a fur trade contract from 1692 containing one of the earliest references to "Chicagou," and the oldest copy in existence of the [[Popol Vuh]].

The Newberry also offers a variety of exhibitions, meet-the-author lectures, continuing education classes, concerts, teacher programs, and other public programming related to its collections. Recent exhibitions have featured [[Daniel Burnham]]'s famous ''Plan of Chicago'' of 1909, artifacts of World War I, and a crowd-sourced aggregation of materials related to love, from heart-shaped Renaissance maps to early twentieth-century American sheet music.

The Newberry's Research and Academic Programs Division offers short- and long-term fellowships for local, national, and international scholars, in addition to managing two separate semester-long seminars for undergraduate students. The four research centers foster, generate, and disseminate scholarship in their areas of focus: medieval, early modern, and Renaissance studies; American Indian and Indigenous Studies; the history of cartography; and American history and culture.

Reference staff are available in the Newberry's two reading rooms and in its third-floor reference room whenever the library is open. Reference librarians work with all readers and offer orientation, in-depth bibliographical instruction, and specialized assistance as needed. The library is open to all researchers over 14 years of age.

The Newberry was the primary institution responsible for the production of the 2004 ''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]],'' a landmark single-volume work that covered [[Chicago]]'s history from 1630 to 2000.

[http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/ The Atlas of Historical County Boundaries Project], a historical GIS project that aims to map every county boundary configuration in the United States from the early seventeenth century to the present, is also based at the Newberry.

The Newberry Bookstore, located in the lobby of the library, curates a selection of books reflecting the Newberry's collection strengths and upcoming public programming, while offering other goods such as cards, posters, and literary action figures.

== Newberry Library Award ==
In 1987, the Newberry established the Newberry Library Award in honor of its 100th anniversary. The Newberry Library Award is an honor bestowed to individuals, and in the case of the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], organizations, who have made "outstanding contributions to the humanities, particularly in fields of endeavor related to the Newberry’s collection."&lt;ref name=Newberry-Award-McCullough-2013&gt;{{cite news|title=David McCullough to Receive Newberry Award|url=https://www.newberry.org/david-mccullough-receive-newberry-award|work=Newberry Library|date=March 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award itself is a scale-sized model of the full-sized [[Virginio Ferrari]] sculpture created in 1987 called ''Umanitá'' that greets visitors as they enter the Newberry Library.&lt;ref name=Newberry-Award-Oakley-2012&gt;{{cite news|title=Newberry Honors Williams College's Francis C.

==In popular culture==
The Newberry was featured as the workplace of Henry DeTamble, a main character in [[Audrey Niffenegger]]'s novel ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]''; many scenes in the book are set at the library, and (fictional) members of the library staff play a considerable role in the plot.

The '''Nine Lyric''' or '''Melic Poets''' were a canonical group of [[ancient Greek poetry|ancient Greek]] poets esteemed by the scholars of [[Hellenistic]] [[Alexandria]] as worthy of critical study. In the [[Palatine Anthology]] it is said that they established lyric song. &lt;ref&gt;J. M. Edmonds - [https://books.google.com/books?id=CdLGSRQvDYMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lyra Graeca (p.3)] Wildside Press LLC, 2007 {{ISBN|1434491307}} [Retrieved 2015-05-06]&lt;/ref&gt;

They were:
*[[Alcman]] of [[Sparta]] (choral lyric, 7th century BC)
*[[Sappho]] of [[Lesbos]] (monodic lyric, {{circa|lk=no|600}} BC)
*[[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] of [[Mytilene]] (monodic lyric, {{circa|lk=no|600}} BC)
*[[Anacreon]] of [[Teos]] (monodic lyric, 6th century BC)
*[[Stesichorus]] of [[Metauros]] (choral lyric, 7th century BC)
*[[Ibycus]] of [[Rhegium]] (choral lyric, 6th century BC)
*[[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]] of [[Ceos]] (choral lyric, 6th century BC)
*[[Bacchylides]] of [[Ceos]] (choral lyric, 5th century BC)
*[[Pindar]] of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] (choral lyric, 5th century BC)

In most Greek sources the word ''melikos'' (from ''melos'', "song") is used to refer to these poets, but the variant ''lyrikos'' (from ''lyra'', "[[lyre]]") became the regular form in both Latin (as ''lyricus'') and in modern languages. The ancient scholars defined the genre on the basis of the musical accompaniment, not the content. Thus, some types of poetry which would be included under the label "[[lyric poetry]]," in modern [[literary criticism|criticism]] are excluded&amp;mdash;namely, the [[elegiac couplet#Greek origins|elegy]] and [[iambus (genre)|iambus]] which were performed with [[aulos|flutes]].

The Nine Lyric Poets are traditionally divided among those who primarily composed [[choral poetry|choral]] verses, and those who composed [[monodic]] verses. This division is contested by some modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. esp. M. Davies's "Monody, Choral Lyric, and the Tyranny of the Hand-Book" in ''Classical Quarterly'', NS&amp;nbsp;38 (1988), pp.&amp;nbsp;52&amp;ndash;64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipater of Thessalonica proposes an alternative canon of nine female poets.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez Robbio, Matías S. (2014) «''Musas y escritoras: el primer canon de la literatura femenina de la Grecia antigua (AP IX 26)''». Praesentia, v. 15, 2014, pp. 1-9. ISSN (en línea): 1316-1857.

The term has received some criticism for its derogatory and elitist nature. [[Eric Thomas (academic)|Eric Thomas]], Vice-Chancellor of [[Bristol University]] has criticised it because of the way in which it makes people view British higher education through an Oxbridge prism.&lt;ref&gt;Liz Lightfoot, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/main.jhtml?xml=/education/2004/01/21/tenedu321.xml Bristol may reject candidates who favour Oxbridge], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 21 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Gordon Brown]], then [[Chancellorship of Gordon Brown|Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and subsequently [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], started a major political row about [[higher education]] when he accused Oxford University of [[elitism]] in its admissions procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/759114.stm| title = Oxford 'reject' wins Harvard scholarship| accessdate = 2007-03-30| date = 2000-05-22| work = BBC News| publisher = [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Laura Spence Affair]], as it became known, is one of the most publicised cases of an Oxbridge reject. Rejected from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] to read medicine, [[Laura Spence]] went on to study with a scholarship at [[Harvard]] in the [[United States]]. The rejection was seen as discrimination because of her state-school background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/oxbridge/article/0,,326388,00.html The war of Laura's rejection], ''[[The Observer]]'', 28 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Madala Panji''''' ([[Oriya language|Odia]] ''ମାଦଳ ପାଂଜି'') is a chronicle of the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]] in Odisha. It describes the historical events of Odisha related to [[Jagannath]] and the Jagannath Temple.&lt;sup&gt;[[Madala Panji#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; The ''Madala Panji'' dates from the 12th century.The Madala Panji was traditionally written on a year-to-year basis. On [[Vijayadashami|Vijaya-Dashami]] day, the [[Karan (caste)|Karanas]] (official history writers of Puri, a caste of Odisha, involved in keeping the chronicle. The tradition of keeping this chronicle began with Odia king [[Anantavarman Chodaganga]] Dev (1078–1150).

According to the tradition, Chodaganga created 24 families of Karanas to preserve the temple records. Of these, five were entrusted with the writing and preservation of the Madala Panji. They are:
* Panjia Karan—preserves the Madala Panji
* Tadau Karan—writes the Madala Panji
* Deula Karan—enforces the Madala
* Kotha Karan—the main compiler
* Baithi Karan – assistant

==Two schools of Bengali panjika-makers==
There are two schools of ''panjika''-makers in Bengal – Driksiddhanta ([[Vishuddha Siddhanta Panjika|''Bisuddhasiddhanta Panjika'']]) and Driksiddhanta (''Gupta Press'', ''PM Bagchi'', etc.). They dictate the days on which festivals are to be held. Sometimes, they lay down different dates for particular festivals. For the [[Durga Puja]] in 2005, two different sets of dates came through. Some community pujas followed the ''Gupta Press Panjika'', because of its popularity. It was with deference to convention, confirmed Pandit Nitai Chakraborty, president of Vaidik Pandit O Purohit Mahamilan Kendra. [[Belur Math]] adhered to ''Bisuddhasiddhanta Panjika''. It was [[Apostles of Ramakrishna#Swami Vijnanananda|Swami Vijnanananda]] (who became Math president in 1937–38), an astrologer, who decided that [[Ramakrishna Mission]] would follow this almanac as it was more scientific.&lt;ref name =  "Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050523/asp/calcutta/story_4765768.asp| title = Almanac shaves Pujas by a day – Conflicting schedules from twin schools on Navami and Dashami| accessdate =  15 April 2007| last = Banerjee| first = Sudeshna| publisher = The Telegraph| location=Calcutta, India| date=23 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference occurs because the two schools follow different [[Lunisolar calendar|calendars of luni-solar movement]] on which [[tithi]]s are based. While ''Gupta Press Panjika'' follows 16th century [[Raghunandana|Raghunandan]]'s work ''Ashtabingshatitatwa'' based on the 1,500-year-old astronomical treatise, [[Surya Siddhanta|''Suryasiddhanta'']]. ''Bisuddhasiddhanta Panjika'' is based on an 1890 amendment of the planetary positions given in ''Suryasiddhanta''.&lt;ref name =  "Telegraph"/&gt;

==Scientific reform==
The earliest Indian almanacs date back to around 1000 BCE. It did analyse time but the calculations were not always very accurate. [[Surya Siddhanta|''Suryasiddhanta'']], produced in that era, was the forerunner of all later day ''panjikas''.&lt;ref name =  "Banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Howlader |first=AR |year=2012 |chapter=Panjika |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Panjika |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During British rule, Biswambhar again began the work of publishing the ''panjika'', in handwritten book form. The printed version came in 1869. ''Bisuddhasiddhanta Panjika'' was first published in 1890.&lt;ref name =  "Banglapedia"/&gt; Gupta Press follows ''Suryasiddhanta'' with the original format while the version with "corrected" scripture is called ''Visuddhasiddhanta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=231755 |title=Now Panjika in CD Format |accessdate=15 April 2007 |last=Khanna |first=Rohit |publisher=''Financial Express'', 14 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509011103/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=231755 |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bisuddhasiddhanta Panjika'' came into being because an astronomer Madhab Chandra Chattopadhyay, on studying the ''panjikas'' then in vogue found differences in the actual and astrological position of the planets and stars. He revised the ''panjika'' as per scientific readings. There were other people in different parts of India who also supported the approach for scientific revision of the ''panjika''. It included such people as [[:or:Pathani samanta|Mahamahopadhyay Chandrasekhar Singha Samanta]] in [[Odisha]] and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] in Pune.&lt;ref&gt;''Bishudhasiddhanta Panjika'', 1412 edition, p. ka 16, {{Bn icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, a major revision of the ''panjika'' was undertaken under the aegis of the Indian government.&lt;ref name =  "Banglapedia"/&gt;

==The transformation==
Gupta Press, one of the Bengali ''panjikas'', has come out in 2007 with a CD-version packed with interactive features like 'know your day', 'daily horoscope' and 'koshthi bichar' (horoscope). Transformation has been staple food for the ''panjika''. With the passage of time it has added information, like tourist attractions, pilgrim destinations, telephone codes and general information that common people seek, to make it more attractive. The format has also been made more flexible to cater to the needs of varied groups. The variants like 'directory panjika' (magnum opus) 'full panjika' (thinner version) and 'half panjika' (abridged version) and 'pocket panjika' have different price tags. The pocket ''panjika'' is a hawkers' delight on local trains.&lt;ref name =  "FE"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Madan Gupter Full Panjika'', which came out in the 1930s, has not changed much externally. The cover is still the same, on thick pink paper, but the inside is very different. The pages have changed from coarse newsprint to smooth white paper, the letter press has made way for offset printing, wooden blocks have been replaced by sharp photographs. The biggest difference is in the ad-editorial ratio. Previously the ads formed the bulk of the printed matter – and were pure delight.  "When there was no TV and not so many newspapers, the ''panjika'' was the place to advertise for many products. Many people bought ''panjikas'' for the ads," says the owner Mahendra Kumar Gupta, "They would offer solutions to many 'incurable' diseases." The 1938 edition started off with a full-page ad on an "Electric Solution", which promised to revive dead men. Now they publish [[Durga Puja]] timings in London, Washington and New York, based on the sunset and sunrise there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arijit Roychowdhury, managing director of Gupta Press, ''panjika'' sales plunged after partition of India, as the market was lost in the eastern part of the former state. However, with innovative transformation of format and content, sales have been picking up and the overall annual market in 2007 is 2 million copies. The figure includes sales in the US and the UK.&lt;ref name =  "FE"/&gt;

''Panjikas'' have found their way into modern day shopping malls also. A senior official of the RPG group, [[Mani Shankar Mukherjee]], himself a reputed author, said, "Our Spencer's store in [[Gurgaon]] has sold a record number of ''panjikas''."&lt;ref name =  "FE"/&gt; Bengali ''panjikas'' follow the [[Bengali calendar]] and are normally out in the month of [[Choitro]], so that people can buy it well before [[Pohela Baishakh]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2310">In [[rhetoric]], a '''parenthesis''' (plural: ''parentheses''; from the [[Ancient Greek]] word παρένθεσις ''parénthesis'' 'injection, insertion', literally '(a) putting in beside') or '''parenthetical phrase''' is an explanatory or qualifying word, clause, or sentence inserted into a passage. The parenthesis could be left out and still form grammatically correct text.&lt;ref name="Walker1823"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Walker|title=A Rhetorical Grammar: In which the Common Improprieties in Reading and Speaking are Detected ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TsJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA99|year=1823|publisher=T. Cadell|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parentheses are usually marked off by round or square [[bracket]]s, dashes, or commas.

==Examples==
;Billy-bob, a great singer, was not a good dancer.:The phrase ''a great singer'', set off by commas, is both an [[appositive]] and a parenthesis.
;A dog (not a cat) is an animal that barks.:The phrase ''not a cat'' is a parenthesis.
;My umbrella (which is somewhat broken) can still shield the two of us from the rain.:The phrase ''which is somewhat broken'' is a parenthesis.
;Please, Gerald, come here!: ''Gerald'' is both a noun of [[direct address]] and a parenthesis.

==Types==
The following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:
*Introductory phrase: Once upon a time, my father ate a muffin.&lt;ref&gt;''Garner's Modern American Usage'', (Oxford: 2003, p. 655)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interjection: My father ate the muffin, gosh darn it!
*Aside: My father, if you don’t mind me telling you this, ate the muffin.
*[[Apposition|Appositive]]: My father, a jaded and bitter man, ate the muffin.
*Absolute phrase: My father, his eyes flashing with rage, ate the muffin.
*Free modifier: My father, chewing with unbridled fury, ate the muffin.
*Resumptive modifier: My father ate the muffin, a muffin which no man had yet chewed.
*Summative modifier: My father ate the muffin, a feat which no man had attempted.

==Punctuation==
While a parenthesis need not be written enclosed by the [[bracket|curved brackets]] called ''parentheses'', their use, principally around rhetorical parentheses, has made the [[punctuation mark]]s the only common use for the term in most contexts.

'''Passive fluency''' is where a person can [[Fluency|fluently]] read and audibly understand a [[language]] whilst not having the ability to fluently speak or write the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Leap | first= W. | date= 1988 | title= Indian language renewal | journal= Human Organization | publisher= | volume= 47 | issue= 4 | pages= 283–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive fluency is often brought about by being raised in one language (which becomes the person's passive language) and being schooled in another language (which becomes the person's native language).&lt;ref name = "basham"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Basham | first = Charlotte | last2 = Fathman | first2 = Ann | date = 19 December 2008 | title = The Latent Speaker: Attaining Adult Fluency in an Endangered Language | journal = International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 577–597 | doi = 10.1080/13670050802149192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are passively fluent in a language are often [[latent speakers]] who were raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.&lt;ref name = "basham" /&gt;

==Language Attitudes regarding "Passive Bilinguals"==
A more common term for this phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual', where people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judges not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare, and the fluency of a bilingual in his/ her languages is domain- specific: it depends on what they need the languages for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosjean|first1=François|title=Bilingual : Life and Reality|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Massachusetts|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language, despite the fact that there are social (extralinguistic) factors underlying their different competencies.

==A Need for Passive Bilinguals in Basque Country==
Karlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co- official status of Basque and Spanish to become a working reality. As there are currently many monolingual Spanish speakers, and no monolingual Basque speakers, there is not yet a situation where an individual fluent in Basque could speak in his/ her mother tongue, regardless of the domain, circumstance  or interlocutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasolo|first1=Karlos Cid|title=Bilingüísmo, monolingüísmo y sesquilingüismo en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca|journal=Revista de Filología Románica|date=2009|volume=26|pages=229–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Perchance to Dream'''" is the 26th episode of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. It was written by noted horror author [[Joe R. Lansdale]] and originally aired on October 19, 1992. In this episode, Bruce Wayne awakes in a seemingly idyllic dream world in which his parents are still alive and he never became Batman. The title is taken from the famous soliloquy from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.

==Plot==
The episode opens with [[Batman]] pursuing a group of criminals on a road. After overcoming several of them, barrels of oil hit and spill on the Batmobile's windshield.  After the oil is removed, the group of criminals reach a warehouse and enter. Batman stops his car and throws a rope onto a lamp post, using it to climb into the warehouse’s window. He walks slowly but suddenly he is blinded by a flash of light and a dark shape descends upon him, knocking him unconscious. He then awakens in bed as [[Bruce Wayne]], with no memory of the outcome of the battle or how he came to be home.

It quickly becomes clear that something is very wrong: there is no [[Batcave]] beneath [[Wayne Manor]], and [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] professes to have no knowledge of Bruce's alter ego or of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Furthermore, Bruce's parents are still alive and he is engaged to [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]]. Though Bruce remembers his adventures as Batman, he can find no evidence that they were anything more than a dream, and he soon begins to doubt his own sanity.

Bruce initially attempts to relax into his new life; at least on the surface, it appears to be everything he has ever wanted. He is disquieted by the discovery that Batman does still exist, however, and appears to be even more powerful and impressive than he ever was. Further evidence that something is very wrong comes when Bruce attempts to read first a newspaper and then a book from his personal library, discovering that the text is a garbled and unreadable mess.

Determined to discover an explanation for what is going on, Bruce purchases a torch and grappling hook. He is confronted by some police who attempt to take him into [[Police custody|custody]], citing his "strange behavior", but Bruce flees them and escapes to Gotham Cemetery. Once there, he climbs a belltower and finds himself face to face with Batman in the middle of a raging storm. Bruce demands to know what is happening and states that he wants his old life back. The two struggle and, as they fight, Bruce explains that he has realized that this is nothing more than a dream world; he is unable to read because reading is a function of the right side of the brain, and dreams are entirely left-sided. Eventually, Bruce is successful in unmasking the imposter Batman, who is revealed to be the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]]. After receiving confirmation from the Mad Hatter that his secret identity has not been compromised, as it is only a dream version of the villain that he is speaking to and the real one cannot see into the dream world, he leaps from the belltower to his apparent death.

Batman then awakens in the warehouse from the beginning of the episode, with the Mad Hatter's dream machine still attached to his head. He escapes and overpowers the villain, demanding an explanation. The Hatter breaks down, saying that Batman has ruined his life (in the episode "Mad as a Hatter") and that he would give him everything that he wanted, just to have him out of his life. Disgusted, Batman turns the Hatter over to the police and leaves, facing reality once again.

==Reception==
"Perchance to Dream" is a very highly regarded episode of ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It received a positive review and an "A-" mark from ''[[The A.V. Club]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avclub.com/articles/eternal-youthperchance-to-dream,55014/ The A.V. Club, accessed January 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Animated Batman'' refers to it as "an astonishing ''tour de force''... the best episode of the series",&lt;ref&gt;http://anbat.toonzone.net/btas/ptd.html The Animated Batman: An Unofficial Guide, accessed January 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and Retrojunk calls the battle between Bruce Wayne and Batman "one of the saddest and most humanistic conclusions in the history of animated television".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.retrojunk.com/details_articles/6163/ Retrojunk, accessed January 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kevin Conroy]], the voice of Batman, considers this his favorite episode of the series.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMiCDMmBzS0&lt;/ref&gt; [[Troy Baker]], who voices the character in the Lego video games and their related cartoon specials, has also claimed this.

The basis for this episode can be found in the plotline of [[Detective Comics]] Volume 1, Number 633. The elements of Bruce Wayne awakening are altered from the original comic book plot, but many elements including Bruce Wayne's prowess, his purchase and use of a rope and grappling hook, remain preserved in the animated episode.

The '''Pula Arena''' ({{lang-hr|'''Pulska Arena'''}}, {{lang-it|'''Arena di Pola'''}}) is the name of the [[amphitheatre]] located in [[Pula]], [[Croatia]]. The Arena is the only remaining Roman amphitheatre to have four side towers and with all three Roman [[Classical order|architectural orders]] entirely preserved. It was constructed in 27 BC – 68 AD&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Kristina69|Kristina Džin]]: 2009, Page 7&lt;/ref&gt; and is among the six largest surviving Roman arenas in the World.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A rare example among the 200 surviving Roman amphitheatres, it is also the best preserved [[ancient monument]] in Croatia.

== Construction ==
The exterior wall is constructed in [[limestone]]. The part facing the sea consists of three stories, while the other part has only two stories since the amphitheatre was built on a slope. The maximum height of the exterior wall is {{convert|29.40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The first two floors have each 72 arches, while the top floor consists of 64 rectangular openings.

The axes of the elliptical amphitheatre are {{convert|132.45|and|105.10|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and the walls stand {{convert|32.45|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. It could accommodate 23,000 spectators in the [[cavea]], which had forty steps divided into two ''meniani''. The seats rest directly on the sloping ground; The field for the games, the proper ''arena'', measured {{convert|67.95|by|41.65|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The field was separated from the public by [[Iron Gate (Danube)|iron gates]].

The arena had a total of 15 gates. A series of underground passageways were built underneath the arena along the main axis from which animals, [[Roman festivals|ludi]] scenes and fighters could be released; stores and shops were located under the raked seating. The amphitheatre was part of the circuit of the [[gladiator]]s.

Each of the four towers had two [[cistern]]s filled with perfumed water that fed a fountain or could be sprinkled on the spectators. The amphitheatre could be covered with ''velaria'' (large sails), protecting the spectators from sun or rain (as attested by rare construction elements).

This amphitheatre, through its remarkable conservation, has served as an excellent example for the study of ancient building techniques.

== History ==
[[File:Anfiteatro de Pula, Croacia, 2017-04-17, DD 58-63 HDR PAN.jpg|thumb|Exterior]]
[[File:Anfiteatro de Pula, Croacia, 2017-04-16, DD 35.jpg|thumb|Amphoras in the exhibition below the arena.]]
The Arena was built between 27 BC and 68 AD,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; as the city of [[Pula]] became a regional centre of Roman rule, called ''[[Pula|Pietas Julia]]''. The name was derived from the [[sand]] that, since antiquity, covered the inner space. It was built outside the town walls along the ''Via Flavia'', the road from [[Pula]] to [[Aquileia]] and [[Rome]].

The amphitheatre was first built in timber during the reign of [[Augustus]] (2–14 AD). It was replaced by a small stone amphitheatre during the reign of emperor [[Claudius]]. In 79 AD it was enlarged to accommodate gladiator fights by [[Vespasian]] and to be completed in 81 AD under emperor [[Titus]].  This was confirmed by the discovery of a [[Vespasian]] coin in the malting.

A Hellene Christian from Byzantine Smyrna named [[Germanicus of Smyrna]] was [[martyr]]ed in the arena in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:sopthgWjV6wJ:heartofistria.org/fileadmin/documents/clanci/Girardi_Path_of_Ancient_Gods_in_Roman_Istria-1.doc+germanus+284+pula+croatia&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgDZfjNi05IECy0I4IeprnMJE-hhTC4MTMXEe1Sa2qbfP2KLs9tPnHzKFwxZaGO2PTcxDJqlp-YylEwParVVYep1ivoYaquQctMUR-HOnuWRQ8_teXfORCxy25I9yClmpvK3xsj&amp;sig=AHIEtbQnv3AOPmA57xMqyYNa8eltjyflAQ PATHS OF ANCIENT GODS IN ROMAN ISTRIA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The amphitheatre remained in use until the 5th century, when emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] prohibited [[gladiator]]ial combats. It was not until 681 that combat between convicts, particularly those [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]], and [[Wildlife|wild animals]] was forbidden.

In the 5th century the amphitheatre began to see its stone plundered by the local populace. By the 13th century, the patriarch of [[Aquileia]] forbade further removal from the Arena.

===Later use===
In the [[Middle Ages]] the interior of the Arena was used for grazing, occasional tournaments by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] and medieval fairs. In 1583 the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Senate]] proposed dismantling the arena and rebuilding it within [[Venice]]. The proposals were rejected. Today, a headstone celebrating the Venetian senator Gabriele Emo's opposition to the plan is currently visible on the second tower.

In 1709, stone was taken from Pula arena for the [[Bell tower|belfry]] foundations at [[Pula Cathedral]]. This was the last time the arena was used as a source of stone.

===Restoration===
[[Auguste de Marmont|General Auguste de Marmont]], as French governor of the [[Illyrian Provinces]], started the restoration of the arena. This was continued in 1816 by the [[Ticino|Ticinese]] architect [[Pietro Nobile]], commissioned by the emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I of Austria]].

In 1932, the arena was adapted for theatre productions, military ceremonies and public meetings. In its present state, seating capacity is around 7000 and 12,500 for all standing events.

==Present day==
The arena is used as a venue for many concerts. Performances have included [[Foo Fighters]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Đorđe Balašević]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Patrizio Buanne]], [[José Carreras|Jose Carreras]], [[Dino Merlin]], [[Jamiroquai]], [[Anastacia]], [[Eros Ramazzotti]], [[Maksim Mrvica]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Zucchero]], [[Zdravko Čolić]], [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Elton John]], [[2Cellos]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], [[Il Divo]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Gibonni]], [[Manu Chao]], [[Oliver Dragojević]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Moderat]], [[David Gilmour]] and Frank Zivkovic.
 
The arena has also been used for cinematic works such as ''[[Titus (film)|Titus]]'', a 1999 film adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s revenge tragedy ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' by [[Julie Taymor]].

Two professional [[ice hockey]] games were played there on September 14 and 16, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leahy|first=Sean|title=Here’s what hockey in a Roman amphitheatre looked like (Spoiler: It was awesome)|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/hockey-roman-amphitheater-looked-spoiler-awesome-181854444--nhl.html|publisher=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KHL Medveščak]], a Zagreb-based [[Erste Bank Eishockey Liga]] club, hosted [[HDD Olimpija Ljubljana]] and the [[Vienna Capitals]].

'''Small talk''' is an informal type of [[discourse]] that does not cover any functional topics of [[conversation]] or any transactions that need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-master-the-art-of-small-talk.html How to Master the Art of Small Talk – For Dummies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of small talk was initially{{cn|date=September 2018}} studied in 1923 by [[Bronisław Malinowski]], who coined the term "[[phatic]] communication" to describe it.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, B. (1923) "The problem of meaning in primitive languages", in: Ogden, C. &amp; Richards, I., ''The Meaning of Meaning'', Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to conduct small talk is a [[social skill]]; hence, small talk is some type of [[social communication]].

== Purpose ==
In spite of seeming to have little useful purpose, small talk is a [[Human bonding|bonding]] ritual and a strategy for managing [[Personal distance|interpersonal distance]].&lt;ref&gt;Bickmore, T. (1999) ''A Computational Model of Small Talk'', accessed online at 
[https://web.archive.org/web/20020117153358/http://web.media.mit.edu/~bickmore/Mas962b/ media.mit.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; It serves many functions in helping to define the relationships between friends, colleagues, and new acquaintances. In particular, it helps new acquaintances to explore and categorize each other's [[social position]].&lt;ref&gt;Laver, J. (1975), "Communicative Functions of Phatic Communion", in: Kendon, A. / Harris, R. / Key, M. (eds.), ''The Organisation of Behaviour in Face-to-Face Interaction'', pp.215–238, The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; Small talk is closely related to the need for people to maintain positive [[Face (self image)|face]] and feel approved of by those who are listening to them. It lubricates social interactions in a very flexible way, but the desired function is often dependent on the point in the conversation at which the small talk occurs:&lt;ref name="holmeszerozero"&gt;Holmes, J. (2000) "Doing collegiality and keeping control at work: small talk in government departments", in: J. Coupland, (ed.) ''Small Talk'', Pearson, Harlow UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Conversation opener]]: when the speakers do not know each other, it allows them to show that they have friendly intentions and desire some sort of positive interaction. In a business meeting, it enables people to establish each other's reputation and level of expertise. If there is already a relationship between the two talkers, their small talk serves as a gentle introduction before engaging in more functional topics of conversation. It allows them to signal their own [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and to sense the mood of the other person.
# At the end of a conversation: suddenly ending an exchange may risk appearing to [[Social rejection|reject]] the other person. Small talk can be used to mitigate that rejection, affirm the relationship between the two people, and soften the parting.
# Space filler to avoid [[silence]]: in many cultures, silences between two people are usually considered uncomfortable and/or awkward. Tension can be reduced by starting phatic talk until a more substantial subject arises. Generally, humans find prolonged silence uncomfortable, and sometimes unbearable. That can be due to human evolutionary history as a social species, as in many other [[social animals]], silence is a communicative sign of potential danger.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jordania]]. "Times to fight and times to relax: Singing and humming at the beginning of Human evolutionary history". Kadmos 1, 2009: 272–277&lt;/ref&gt;

In some conversations, there is no specific functional or informative element at all. The following example of small talk is between two colleagues who pass each other in a hallway:
: ''William'': Morning, Paul.
: ''Paul'': Oh, morning, William, how are you?
: ''William'': Fine, thanks. Have a good weekend?
: ''Paul'': Yes, thanks. Catch you later.
: ''William'': OK, see you.

In that example, the elements of phatic talk at the beginning and end of the conversation have merged. The entire short conversation is a space-filler. This type of discourse is often called ''chatter''.

The need to use small talk depends upon the nature of the relationship between the people having the conversation. Couples in an [[intimate relationship]] can signal their level of closeness by a lack of small talk. They can comfortably accept silence in circumstances that would be uncomfortable for two people who were only casual friends.&lt;ref&gt;Jaworski, A. (2000) "Silence and small talk", in: J. Coupland, ''Small Talk'', Pearson, Harlow UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

In workplace situations, small talk tends to occur mostly between workers on the same level, but it can be used by [[management|managers]] as a way of developing the working relationships with the staff who report to them. Bosses who ask their employees to work [[overtime]] may try to [[motivation|motivate]] them by using small talk to temporarily decrease their difference in [[social status|status]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, J. (1998) "Don't Under-Rate Small Talk", ''New Zealand Business'', 12,9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The balance between functional conversation and small talk in the workplace depends on the context and is also influenced by the relative [[Power (social and political)|power]] of the two speakers. It is usually the superior who defines the conversation because they have the power to close the small talk and "get down to business."&lt;ref name="holmesfillary"&gt;Holmes, J. &amp; Fillary, R. (2000) "Handling Small Talk at Work: challenges for workers with intellectual disabilities", ''International Journal of Disability'' 47,3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==
The topics of small talk conversations are generally less important than their social function.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, K. &amp; Naughton, J. M. (2000) "Institutional identity-work: a better lens", in: J. Coupland, ''Small Talk'', Pearson, Harlow UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  The selected topic usually depends on any pre-existing [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] between the two people, and the circumstances of the conversation.  In either case, someone initiating small talk will tend to choose a topic for which they can assume a shared background knowledge, to prevent the conversation being too one-sided.&lt;ref name="holmesfillary" /&gt;

Topics can be summarised as being either direct or indirect.&lt;ref&gt;Ventola, E. (1979) "The Structure of Casual Conversation in English", ''Journal of Pragmatics'' 3: pp.267–298.&lt;/ref&gt;  Direct topics include personal observations such as [[health]] or [[looks]].  Indirect topics refer to a situational context such as the latest news, or the conditions of the communicative situation. Some topics are considered to be "safe" in most circumstances,&lt;ref name="holmeszerozero" /&gt; such as the weather, sports and television. Asking about the weather, however, should be avoided unless there exists follow-up discussion. Otherwise, the conversation will stall, and it will be the conversation starter's fault.&lt;ref name=holmeszerozero /&gt;

The level of detail offered should not overstep the bounds of interpersonal space.  When asked "How are you?" by an acquaintance they do not know well, a person is likely to choose a simple, generalised reply such as "I am good, thank you." In this circumstance it would usually not be appropriate for them to reply with a list of symptoms of any medical conditions they were suffering from.&lt;ref name="holmesfillary" /&gt;  To do so would assume a greater degree of [[intimacy|familiarity]] between the two people than is actually the case, and this may create an uncomfortable situation.

== Conversational patterns ==
A study of small talk in situations which involve the chance meeting of strangers has been carried out by Klaus Schneider.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, K. (1988) ''Small Talk: Analysing Phatic Discourse'', PhD thesis, Philipps-Universität, Marburg, W. Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; He theorises that such a conversation consists of a number of fairly predictable segments, or "moves". The first move is usually phrased so that it is easy for the other person to agree. It may be either a question, or a statement of opinion with a [[tag question]]. For example, an opening line such as "Lovely weather, isn't it?" is a clear invitation for agreement. The second move is the other person's response. In functional conversations that address a particular topic, [[Paul Grice|Grice's]] [[Cooperative principle#Maxim of Quantity|Maxim of Quantity]] suggests that responses should contain no more information than was explicitly asked for.&lt;ref&gt;Grice, H. P. (1975) "Logic and Conversation", in: P. Cole &amp; J. Morgan (eds.) ''Syntax and Semantics : Speech Acts'', Vol.3, Academic, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Schneider claims that one of the principles of small talk contradicts the Maxim of Quantity. He suggests that [[politeness]] in small talk is maximised by responding with a more substantial answer. Going back to the example of "Lovely weather, isn't it?", to respond factually by just saying "Yes" (or even "No") is less polite than saying, "Yes, very mild for the time of year". Schneider describes that subsequent moves may involve an acknowledgement such as "I see", a positive evaluation such as "That's nice", or what's called "idling behaviour", such as "Mmm", or "Really?".

== Gender differences ==
Speech patterns between women tend to be more collaborative than those of men, and tend to support each other's involvement in the conversation. Topics for small talk are more likely to include compliments about some aspect of personal appearance. For example, "That dress really suits you."  Small talk between women who are friends may also involve a greater degree of [[self disclosure]]. Topics may cover more personal aspects of their life, their troubles, and their secrets. This self-disclosure both generates a closer relationship between them and is also a signal of that closeness.&lt;ref name="tannen"&gt;Tannen, D. (1992) "How men and women use language differently in their lives and in the classroom", ''The Education Digest'' 57,6.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, men's small talk tends to be more competitive. It may feature [[Stichomythia|verbal sparring matches]], [[Banter|playful insults]], and [[Insult|putdowns]].&lt;ref name="tannen" /&gt; However, in a way these are also both creators and signals of [[social solidarity|solidarity]]; the men are signalling that they are comfortable enough with each other's company to be able to say these things without them being taken as insults.

== Cultural differences ==
Small talk rules and topics can differ widely between [[culture]]s. Weather is a common topic in regions where the climate has great variation and can be unpredictable. Questions about the family are usual in some [[Asia]]n and [[Arab countries]]. In cultures or contexts that are status-oriented, such as [[Chinese culture|China]] and [[Japanese culture|Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. (2000) ''Culture's Consequences'', revised edition, Beverly Hills, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; small talk between new acquaintances may feature questions that enable social categorization of each other. Differences among members of various cultural groups in aspects of their attitudes to small talk and ways of dealing with small talk situations are considered to be rooted in their socioculturally ingrained perception of interpersonal relationships &lt;ref&gt;Cui, X. (2012, October 30).

Getting to the Source: An Instrument for Examining the Dynamics of Problematic Interactions. RELC Journal: A Journal of Language Teaching and Research,  45(2), 197–210.&lt;/ref&gt; In many European cultures it is common to discuss the weather, [[politics of Europe|politics]] or [[Economy of Europe|the economy]], although in some countries [[personal finance]] issues such as [[salary]] are considered [[taboo]].&lt;ref&gt;Grzega, J.

[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|right|thumb|''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' (1907), also by Picasso in a different style ("[[Picasso's African Period]]") four years later.]]In the [[visual arts]], '''style''' is a "...distinctive manner which permits the grouping of works into related categories"&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Fernie|Fernie, Eric]]. ''Art History and its Methods: A critical anthology''. London: Phaidon, 1995, p. 361. {{ISBN|978-0-7148-2991-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "...any distinctive, and therefore recognizable, way in which an act is performed or an artifact made or ought to be performed and made".&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 150&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the visual appearance of a work of art that relates it to other works by the same artist or one from the same period, training, location, "school", [[art movement]] or [[archaeological culture]]: "The notion of style has long been the art historian's principal mode of classifying works of art. By style he selects and shapes the history of art".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kubler]] summarizing the view of [[Meyer Schapiro]] (with whom he disagrees), quoted by Alpers in Lang, 138&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Style is often divided into the general style of a period, country or cultural group, group of artists or [[art movement]], and the individual style of the artist within that group style. Divisions within both types of styles are often made, such as between "early", "middle" or "late".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In some artists, such as [[Picasso]] for example, these divisions may be marked and easy to see, in others they are more subtle.  Style is seen as usually dynamic, in most periods always changing by a gradual process, though the speed of this varies greatly, between the very slow development in style typical of [[prehistoric art]] or [[Ancient Egyptian art]] to the rapid changes in [[Modern art]] styles. Style often develops in a series of jumps, with relatively sudden changes followed by periods of slower development.

After dominating academic discussion in [[art history]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries, so-called "style art history" has come under increasing attack in recent decades, and many art historians now prefer to avoid stylistic classifications where they can.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; Kubler in Lang, 163–164; Alpers in Lang, 137–138; 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Any piece of art is in theory capable of being analysed in terms of style; neither periods nor artists can avoid having a style, except by complete incompetence,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kubler]] goes further "No human acts escape style", Kubler in Lang, 167; II, 3 in his list; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and conversely natural objects or sights cannot be said to have a style, as style only results from choices made by a maker.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the artist makes a conscious choice of style, or can identify his own style, hardly matters.  Artists in recent developed societies tend to be highly conscious of their own style, arguably over-conscious, whereas for earlier artists stylistic choices were probably "largely unselfconscious".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 106–107, 107 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Most stylistic periods are identified and defined later by art historians, but artists may choose to define and name their own style. The names of most older styles are the invention of art historians and would not have been understood by the practitioners of those styles. Some originated as terms of derision, including [[Gothic style|Gothic]], [[Baroque]], and [[Rococo]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131; Honour &amp; Fleming, 13–14; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cubism]] on the other hand was a conscious identification made by a few artists; the word itself seems to have originated with critics rather than painters, but was rapidly accepted by the artists.

Western art, like that of some other cultures, most notably [[Chinese art]], has a marked tendency to revive at intervals "classic" styles from the past.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In critical analysis of the visual arts, the style of a work of art is typically treated as distinct from its [[iconography]], which covers the subject and the ''content'' of the work, though for [[Jas Elsner]] this distinction is "not, of course, true in any actual example; but it has proved rhetorically extremely useful".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 107–108, 108 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
[[File:Ivory Egypt Louvre OA2753.jpg|thumb|left|14th-century [[Islamic art|Islamic]] ornament in ivory, centred on a [[palmette]]; [[Alois Riegl]]'s ''[[Stilfragen]]'' (1893) traced the evolution and transmission of such motifs.]]
Classical art criticism and the relatively few medieval writings on [[aesthetics]] did not greatly develop a concept of style in art, or analysis of it,&lt;ref&gt;classical authors did leave a considerable and subtle body of analysis of style in literature, especially [[rhetoric]]; see Gombrich, 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; and though Renaissance and Baroque writers on art are greatly concerned with what we would call style, they did not develop a coherent theory of it, at least outside architecture. [[Giorgio Vasari]] set out a hugely influential but much-questioned account of the development of style in Italian painting (mainly) from [[Giotto]] to his own [[Mannerist]] period.  He stressed the development of a [[Florence|Florentine]] style based on ''disegno'' or line-based drawing, rather than [[Venice|Venetian]] colour.  With other Renaissance theorists like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] he continued classical debates over the best balance in art between the [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] depiction of nature and idealization of it; this debate was to continue until the 19th century and the advent of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;See Blunt throughout, with in particular pp. 14–22 on Alberti, 28–34 on Leonardo, 61–64 on Michelangelo, 89–95 and 98–100 on Vasari&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorist of [[Neoclassicism]], [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], analysed the stylistic changes in Greek classical art in 1764, comparing them closely to the changes in [[Renaissance art]], and "[[Georg Hegel]] codified the notion that each historical period will have a typical style", casting a very long shadow over the study of style.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; Preziosi, 115–117; Gombrich, 136&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel is often attributed with the invention of the [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', but he never actually used the word, although in ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', he uses the phrase ''der Geist seiner Zeit'' (the spirit of his time), writing "no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;pg=PA262 |page=262 |title=The Hegel Dictionary |author=Glenn Alexander Magee |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2011 |isbn=9781847065919 |chapter=Zeitgeist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructing schemes of the period styles of historic art and architecture was a major concern of 19th-century scholars in the new and initially mostly German-speaking field of [[art history]], with important writers on the broad theory of style including [[Carl Friedrich von Rumohr]], [[Gottfried Semper]], and [[Alois Riegl]] in his ''[[Stilfragen]]'' of 1893, with [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] and [[Paul Frankl]] continuing the debate in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2, 3; Rawson, 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Jacobsthal]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]] are among the art historians who followed Riegl in proposing grand schemes tracing the transmission of elements of styles across great ranges in time and space. This type of art history is also known as [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], or the study of forms or shapes in art.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Semper, Wölfflin, and Frankl, and later Ackerman, had backgrounds in the history of architecture, and like many other terms for period styles, "Romanesque" and "Gothic" were initially coined to describe [[architectural style]]s, where major changes between styles can be clearer and more easy to define, not least because style in architecture is easier to replicate by following a set of rules than style in figurative art such as painting.  Terms originated to describe architectural periods were often subsequently applied to other areas of the visual arts, and then more widely still to music, literature and the general culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 129; Elsner, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In architecture stylistic change often follows, and is made possible by, the discovery of new techniques or materials, from the Gothic [[rib vault]] to modern metal and [[reinforced concrete]] construction.  A major area of debate in both art history and archaeology has been the extent to which stylistic change in other fields like painting or pottery is also a response to new technical possibilities, or has its own impetus to develop (the ''kunstwollen'' of Riegl), or changes in response to social and economic factors affecting patronage and the conditions of the artist, as current thinking tends to emphasize, using less rigid versions of [[Marxist]] art history.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131–136; Elkins, s. 2; Rawson, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Although style was well-established as a central component of art historical analysis, seeing it as the over-riding factor in art history had fallen out of fashion by World War II, as other ways of looking at art were developing,&lt;ref&gt;Kubler in Lang, 163&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a reaction against the emphasis on style; for [[Svetlana Alpers]], "the normal invocation of style in art history is a depressing affair indeed".&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 137&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Elkins (art historian)|James Elkins]] "In the later 20th century criticisms of style were aimed at further reducing the Hegelian elements of the concept while retaining it in a form that could be more easily controlled".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2 (quoted); see also Gombrich, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]], [[James S. Ackerman|James Ackerman]], [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[George Kubler]] (''[[The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things]]'', 1962) have made notable contributions to the debate, which has also drawn on wider developments in [[critical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; analysed by Kubler in Lang, 164–165&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[Jas Elsner]] put it more strongly: "For nearly the whole of the 20th century, style art history has been the indisputable king of the discipline, but since the revolutions of the seventies and eighties the king has been dead",&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 98&lt;/ref&gt; though his article explores ways in which "style art history" remains alive, and his comment would hardly be applicable to archaeology.

The use of terms such as [[Counter-Maniera|Counter-''Maniera'']] appears to be in decline, as impatience with such "style labels" grows among art historians.  In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of 16th-century Italian painting and mentee of [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] (1914–1997), who invented the term, was criticised by a reviewer of her ''After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century'' for her "fundamental flaw" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic "Note on style labels" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 324&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Georges Seurat, 1889-90 Chahut, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Georges Seurat]]'s very individual technique and style, ''[[Le Chahut]]'', 1889–90]]

A rare recent attempt to create a theory to explain the process driving changes in artistic style, rather than just theories of how to describe and categorize them, is by the [[behavioural psychologist]] [[Colin Martindale]], who has proposed an evolutionary theory based on [[Darwinian]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized in his article "Evolution of Ancient Art: Trends in the Style of Greek Vases and Egyptian Painting", ''Visual Arts Research'', Vol. 16, No. 1(31) (Spring 1990), pp. 31–47, University of Illinois Press, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20715715 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  However this cannot be said to have gained much support among art historians.

==Individual style==

Traditional art history has also placed great emphasis on the individual style of an artist: "the notion of personal style—that individuality can be uniquely expressed not only in the way an artist draws, but also in the stylistic quirks of an author's writing (for instance)— is perhaps an axiom of Western notions of identity".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The identification of individual styles is especially important in the attribution of works to artists, which is a dominant factor in their [[art valuation|valuation for the art market]], above all for works in the Western tradition since the Renaissance.  The identification of individual style in works is "essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as [[Connoisseur|connoisseur]]s",&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 139, a situation she sees as problematic&lt;/ref&gt; a group who centre in the art trade and museums, often with tensions between them and the community of academic art historians.&lt;ref&gt;Exemplified in grumbling by Grosvenor; Crane, 214–216&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercise of conoisseurship is largely a matter of subjective impressions that are hard to analyse, but also a matter of knowing details of technique and the "hand" of different artists. [[Giovanni Morelli]] (1816 – 1891) pioneered the systematic study of the scrutiny of diagnostic minor details that revealed artists' scarcely conscious shorthand and conventions for portraying, for example, ears or hands, in Western [[old master]] paintings.  His techniques were adopted by [[Bernard Berenson]] and others, and have been applied to sculpture and many other types of art, for example by Sir [[John Beazley]] to [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Attic vase painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 103; [http://arthistorians.info/morellig ''Dictionary of Art Historians'': "Giovanni Morelli"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal techniques can be important in analysing individual style.  Though artists' training was before Modernism essentially imitative, relying on taught technical methods, whether learnt as an apprentice in a workshop or later as a student in an academy, there was always room for personal variation.  The idea of technical "secrets" closely guarded by the master who developed them, is a long-standing ''[[Literary topos|topos]]'' in art history from Vasari's probably mythical account of Jan van Eyck to the secretive habits of [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref&gt;Gotlieb, throughout; 469–475 on Vasari and van Eyck; 469 on Seurat.&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:Manner of rembrandt harmensz van rijn christ among the doctors d5343274h.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Painting of ''[[Christ among the Doctors]]'', catalogued by [[Christie's]] as "Manner of Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn" and sold for £750 in 2010]]

However the idea of personal style is certainly not limited to the Western tradition. In [[Chinese art]] it is just as deeply held, but traditionally regarded as a factor in the appreciation of some types of art, above all [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[literati painting]], but not others, such as Chinese porcelain;&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 92–102; 111–119&lt;/ref&gt; a distinction also often seen in the so-called [[decorative arts]] in the West. Chinese painting also allowed for the expression of political and social views by the artist a good deal earlier than is normally detected in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Calligraphy, also regarded as a [[fine art]] [[Islamic calligraphy|in the Islamic world]] and [[East Asia]], brings a new area within the ambit of personal style; the ideal of Western calligraphy tends to be to suppress individual style, while [[graphology]], which relies upon it, regards itself as a science.

==Manner==
"Manner" is a related term, often used for what is in effect a sub-division of a style, perhaps focused on particular points of style or technique.&lt;ref&gt;"What Is Poetry?", "Petronius Arbiter"&lt;!-- pseudonym, not the Roman writer --&gt;, ''The Art World'', Vol. 3, No. 6 (Mar., 1918), pp. 506–511, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25588388 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; While many elements of period style can be reduced to characteristic forms or shapes, that can adequately be represented in simple line-drawn diagrams, "manner" is more often used to mean the overall style and atmosphere of a work, especially complex works such as paintings, that cannot so easily be subject to precise analysis. It is a somewhat outdated term in academic art history, avoided because it is imprecise.  When used it is often in the context of imitations of the individual style of an artist, and it is one of the hierarchy of discreet or diplomatic terms used in the [[art trade]] for the relationship between a work for sale and that of a well-known artist, with "Manner of [[Rembrandt]]" suggesting a distanced relationship between the style of the work and Rembrandt's own style.  The "Explanation of Cataloguing Practice" of the auctioneers [[Christie's]]' explains that "'''Manner of ...'''" in their auction catalogues means "In our opinion a work executed in the artist's style but of a later date".&lt;ref&gt;[http://christies.scene7.com/s7/brochure/flash_brochure.jsp?company=Christies&amp;sku=AMS3025_SaleCat&amp;config=Christies/eCat_210x267_Full&amp;locale=en&amp;image=Christies/AMS3025_SaleCat Christie's "Explanation of Cataloguing Practice" (after lot listings)]. "Style" is not used for paintings etc., but for European porcelain they give the example:"A plate in the Worcester style" means "In our opinion, a copy or imitation of pieces made in the named factory, place or region". For examples, [http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19224/lot/37/ this painting, sold by Bonhams in 2011] as "Manner of Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn", is now attributed in their notes to "an anonymous eighteenth-century follower of Rembrandt". [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/manner-of-rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn-christ-5343274-details.aspx This example sold by Christie's] fetched only £750 in 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mannerism]], derived from the Italian ''maniera'' ("manner") is a specific phase of the general Renaissance style, but "manner" can be used very widely.

==Style in archaeology==
[[File:1911 Britannica-Archaeology-Palaeolithic.png|thumb|right|[[Paleolithic]] stone tools grouped by period]]

In [[archaeology]], despite modern techniques like [[radiocarbon dating]], period or cultural style remains a crucial tool in the identification and [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] not only of works of art but all classes of [[archaeological artefact]], including purely functional ones (ignoring the question of whether purely functional artefacts exist).&lt;ref&gt;See also Alpers in Lang, 140&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of individual styles of artists or [[artisan]]s has also been proposed in some cases even for remote periods such as the [[Ice Age art]] of the European [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bahn &amp; Vertut, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

As in art history, [[formal analysis]] of the [[morphology (archaeology)|morphology]] (shape) of individual artefacts is the starting point. This is used to construct [[Typology (archaeology)|typologies]] for different types of artefacts, and by the technique of [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] a [[relative dating]] based on style for a site or group of sites is achieved where scientific [[absolute dating]] techniques cannot be used, in particular where only stone, ceramic or metal artefacts or remains are available, which is often the case.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thermoluminescence dating]] can be used for much ceramic material, and the developing method of [[Rehydroxylation dating]] may become widely used.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sherd]]s of [[pottery]] are often very numerous in sites from many cultures and periods, and even small pieces may be confidently dated by their style. In contrast to recent trends in academic art history, the succession of schools of archaeological theory in the last century, from [[culture-historical archaeology]] to [[processual archaeology]] and finally the rise of [[post-processual archaeology]] in recent decades has not significantly reduced the importance of the study of style in archaeology, as a basis for classifying objects before further interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Mary Ann Levine of ''The Uses of Style in Archaeology'', edited by [[Margaret Conkey]] and Christine Hastorf (see further reading), pp. 779–780, ''American Antiquity'', Vol. 58, No. 4 (Oct., 1993), Society for American Archaeology, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/282229 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stylization==
[[File:Uffington-White-Horse-sat.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the very stylized prehistoric [[Uffington White Horse]] in England]]
'''Stylization''' and '''stylized''' (or "stylisation" and "stylised" in (non-Oxford) [[British English]], respectively) have a more specific meaning, referring to visual depictions that use simplified ways of representing objects or scenes that do not attempt a full, precise and accurate representation of their visual appearance (''[[mimesis]]'' or "[[Realism (arts)|realistic]]"), preferring an attractive or expressive overall depiction.  More technically, it has been defined as "the decorative generalization of figures and objects by means of various conventional techniques, including the simplification of line, form, and relationships of space and color",&lt;ref&gt;"Stylization" in the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', 1979, online at [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Stylization The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and observed that "[s]tylized art reduces visual perception to constructs of pattern in line, surface elaboration and flattened space".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Willene B., ''A Medieval Book of Beasts: The Second-Family Bestiary, Commentary, Art, Text And Translation'', p. 54, 2006, Boydell Press, {{ISBN|0851156827}}, 9780851156828, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0olPRmCoE8MC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Stylization+in+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NFqIaLTG4F&amp;sig=p-PbpnBNfgUusEYLRigTrlC3Ebc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fJo4UeflKYetPP3YgIgK&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Stylization%20in%20art&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient, traditional, and [[modern art]], as well as popular forms such as [[cartoon]]s or [[animation]] very often use stylized representations, so for example ''[[The Simpsons]]'' use highly stylized depictions, as does traditional [[African art]].  The two Picasso paintings illustrated at the top of this page show a movement to a more stylized representation of the human figure within the painter's style,&lt;ref&gt;See Elsner, 107 on Picasso as the paradigm of "the supremely self-conscious poseur in any style you like".&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Uffington White Horse]] is an example of a highly stylized prehistoric depiction of a horse.  Motifs in the [[decorative arts]] such as the [[palmette]] or [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] are often highly stylized versions of the parts of plants.

Even in art that is in general attempting mimesis or "realism", a degree of stylization is very often found in details, and especially figures or other features at a small scale, such as people or trees etc. in the distant background even of a large work.  But this is not stylization intended to be noticed by the viewer, except on close examination.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, John, ''The Slumber of Apollo: Reflections on Recent Art, Literature, Language and the Individual Consciousness'', p. 30, 1983, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521248043}}, 9780521248044, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EuoILxxW9cQC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Stylization+in+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qJw4UbeGIsS7PaHJgNAC&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Stylization%20in%20art&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings, ''[[modelli]]'', and other sketches not intended as finished works for sale will also very often stylize.

"Stylized" may mean the adoption of any style in any context, and in [[American English]] is often used for the [[typographic]] style of names, as in "[[AT&amp;T]] is also stylized as ATT and at&amp;t": this is a specific usage that seems to have escaped dictionaries, although it is a small extension of existing other senses of the word.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Sydney rock engravings''', or '''Sydney rock art''', are a form of [[Australian Aboriginal]] [[rock art]] in the [[Sydney sandstone|sandstone]] around [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], that consist of carefully drawn images of people, animals, or symbols.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J. 1999. Bedrock notions and isochrestic choice: evidence for localised stylistic patterning in the engravings of the Sydney region. Archaeology in Oceania 34(3): 145-160.&lt;/ref&gt; Many thousands of such engravings are known to exist in the Sydney region, although the locations of most are not publicised to prevent damage by vandalism, and to retain their sanctity, as they are still regarded as sacred sites by [[Indigenous Australians]]. There are two art environments in Sydney Basin, rock shelters and engraving sites.&lt;ref&gt;Basedow, H. 1914. Aboriginal rock carvings of great antiquity in S.A. J. R. Anthropol. Inst., 44, 195–211. &lt;/ref&gt; 

There are 1,500 pieces of Aboriginal art in Sydney, more than half of which contain rock art, and around 1,500 caves or shelters which contain cultural deposit. They are comparable with the [[petroglyphs]] of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and the [[rock art]] found elsewhere in Australia, but have their own distinctive style which is quite unlike rock art found anywhere else in Australia. Dating to around [[4th millennium BC|5,000]] years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/history-culture/2016/03/top-7-aboriginal-rock-art-sites/ Australia's top 7 Aboriginal rock art sites by Australian Geographic]&lt;/ref&gt; with some possibly as old as [[6th millennium BC|7,000 years]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/23/hidden-in-plain-sight-indigenous-australian-rock-art-on-sydneys-doorstep Hidden in plain sight: Indigenous Australian rock art on Sydney's doorstep] by [[The Guardian]] (Author: Brigid Delaney)&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney rock art is predominantly found in [[Ku-ring-gai Council]], [[Sydney Harbour]] and the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]].&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowdler|first=Sandra|title=Balls Head: the excavation of a Port Jackson rock shelter.

==Origins==
[[File:(1)rock carvings Bondi-4.JPG|thumb|220px|Whale carvings in [[Bondi, New South Wales|Bondi]].]]
The engravings were made by the [[Aboriginal Australians]] who have lived in the [[Sydney]] region from about 30,000 years ago until the present day. [[Radiocarbon dating]] suggests human activity first started to occur in the Sydney area from around 30,735 years ago. However, numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Western Sydney's gravel sediments that were dated from 45,000 to 50,000 years BP, which would indicate that there was human settlement in Sydney earlier than thought.&lt;ref name=Attenbrow-2010&gt;{{Cite book | last1= Attenbrow | first1= Val | year= 2010 | title= Sydney's Aboriginal Past: Investigating the Archaeological and Historical Records | location= Sydney | publisher= UNSW Press | isbn= 978-1-74223-116-7 | pages= 152–153 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TDxldj_SLcYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Val%20Attenbrow%22&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | accessdate= 11 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engravings cannot be dated straightforwardly with contemporary archaeological methods, necessitating the use of indirect dating. The Sydney engravings are of a style known as "simple [[Figurative art|figurative]]", which formulaic archaeology dates to around [[3,000 BC]] and [[4th millennium BC|4,000 BC]], which is contemporaneous to the [[neolithic]] period in [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Flood, 'Rock Art of the Dreamtime',  {{ISBN|0-207-18908-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other engravings show [[Europe]]an [[sailing ships]], and so those cannot be more than about 200 years old. It is likely that some of the freshest engravings represent the later part of that time range, whilst the most worn represent the earliest part. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that the engravings were sometimes "re-grooved" during ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;David, B., J-M. Geneste, F. Petchey, J-J. Delannoy, B. Barker and M. Eccleston. 2013b. ‘How old are Australia’s pictographs? A Review of Rock Art Dating’. Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (1): 3–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some engravings appear to show [[thylacine]]s and other mammals which have been extinct in the Sydney region for many thousands of years, and thus can be presumably that old. In support of this, it is true that rock art elsewhere (e.g. [[Kakadu National Park]]) does show extinct animals, and so must be tens of thousands of years old. However, at the moment there is no hard evidence to support these claims for Sydney rock art.&lt;ref&gt;Bednarik, R. G. 1992. ‘A New Method to Date Petroglyphs’. Archaeometry 34 (2): 279–91. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Method of creation==
Examination of the grooves shows that they were made in several stages as follows:

* Presumably, a sketched outline was scratched on to the surface of the rock.
* Then a series of holes was drilled along the line, using a pointed stone or shell, which is possible because the [[Sydney Basin]] [[sandstone]] is relatively soft.
* Finally, the holes were joined by rubbing a sharp stone along the line.

This results in a U-shaped groove which is typically about 2 centimetres deep and 2 centimetres wide. It is easily distinguished from natural grooves in the sandstone, which are usually V-shaped, modern grooves made with steel tools, which are usually narrower and deeper, or those made by bulldozers, which usually have a square section.&lt;ref&gt; McDonald, J. 2008a. Dreamtime Superhighway: Sydney Basin Rock Art and Prehistoric Information Exchange. Terra Australis 27. ANU EPress, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;

The grooves were often maintained by "re-grooving" during ceremonies, which complicates attempts at dating them.&lt;ref&gt;Lilley, I. 2006. ‘Archaeology in Oceania: Themes and Issues.’ Archaeology of Oceania: Australia and the Pacific Islands, 1– 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
While their purpose is not known definitively, some educated guesses may be made by analogy with the culture of other indigenous groups who survived into modern times, as follows. Some sites may have been "increase sites", where a ceremony would be held to increase the availability of a food source such as kangaroos or fish. It is thought that most of the sites depicting animals are of this type.

Another group of sites may have been where initiation ceremonies were held, to celebrate and facilitate the transition of a young boy into manhood. In other parts of [[Australia]], we know that an initiation ceremony often involves a ceremonial path from childhood into manhood, and so the lines of steps, or mundoes, may indicate initiation sites. Other sites show "Culture Heroes" or "Ancestral Beings" such as [[Baiame]], who has a striped head-dress and often a striped body, and [[Daramulan]] who has a large club foot and may have been part-emu.

Some sites also show evidence of [[Australian Aboriginal Astronomy|Aboriginal Astronomy]], as the rock's patterns resemble the [[Milky Way]] and this may have been purposed as an astrological guide. It should also be recognised that increase sites, initiation sites, culture-hero sites, and astronomical sites are not necessarily distinct, and one site may fall into any or all of these categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.EmuDreaming.com|title=Aboriginal Astronomy|website=www.emudreaming.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:Terrey Hills public.jpg|thumb|220px|Engravings at Terrey Hills in northern Sydney. The two kangaroos suggest this was used for an increase ceremony, whilst the well-endowed man may be [[Baiame]].]]
The aboriginal rock engraving sites usually contain images of sacred [[spiritual being]]s, mythical ancestral hero figures, various endemic animals, fish and many footprints. Surrounding the rock engravings, there are art sites, [[burial]] sites, [[cave]]s, marriage areas, men’s areas, women’s areas, birthing areas, [[midden]] sites, stone arrangement sites and tool manufacturing locations.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J.1994. ‘Dreamtime Superhighway: Sydney Basin Rock Art and Prehistoric Information Exchange.’ PhD, Canberra: Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Les McLeod, a local indigenous guide in [[Hawkesbury, New South Wales|Hawkesbury]] stated, “A lot of Aboriginal people believe they were created from animals – there are engravings here of wallabies, fish and emus”. “Sydney sandstone is easy to engrave but easy to fade. The [[Guringai]] people would have visited a couple of times a year to re-engrave it.” In some small cave on the water’s edge, there are ochre [[hand stencil]]s from a group of Guringai men (and from a smaller handprint, a minor). The stencils would have been a way of letting other members of the clan know that this cave or ledge is a safe place to dwell in. Rock paintings of a fish just above the water line signaled to others that fish could be found at this area. The majority (97%) of the etched motifs are
outline only. The only systematically infilled engravings are [[culture hero]]es which are usually decorated with a number of pecked lines of dots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboriginalheritage.org/sites/identification/ Identifying Aboriginal Sites]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Shelters with art are characterised by stencil art or [[charcoal]]. Stencil is created by mixing [[ochre]] in the mouth and then into a wet paste, where it is sprayed over the object to be stencilled onto the wall of the shelter. Other forms of artwork include ochre paintings, charcoal drawings and etchings. Rock painting illustration usually feature humans, kangaroos, emus, echidnas, grid patterns, animal tracks, boomerangs, axes, hand stencils, among others. Black is the frequent colour used in Sydney, accounting for 46.2% of the pigment art. Followed by white (34.6%), red (16.6%) and yellow (2.8%). There are also a number of grinding grooves located throughout the general Sydney area.  Burial sites are present throughout the Sydney region, and many have been found over the past years in middens and within shelters. &lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J. 1998. Shelter art in the Sydney Basin - a space-time continuum: exploring different influences on stylistic change. In C. Chippindale &amp; P. Taçon (eds) Rock Art: New Directions in Archaeology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock engravings in Sydney would usually feature fish, animals, humans, wooden artefacts, and mythological beings. Stone quarries are sites where Aboriginals accumulate types of [[stone]] for the manufacturing of tools, ceremonial and sacred items. The majority of the fine stone flakes and tools recovered in the local area would have been traded from other areas such as the north coast, [[Hunter Valley]], and the [[Nepean River]]. [[Water well|Dug wells]] in the Sydney region were used by the local tribe to sharpen tools and also as a source of fresh [[drinking water]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, F. D., 1956. Rock engravings of the Sydney-Hawkesbury District. Part 1: Flat Rocks Ridge: a Daruk ceremonial ground. Records of the Australian Museum 24(5): 37–58, plates 3–6. [23 November 1956].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motif frequency===

A total of 7,804 motifs were studied from the 717 engravings sites, with a salient focus on tracks, followed by a predilection for [[marine animal]]s and land animals, [[anthropomorphic]]
models and cultural items.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, L. 1977. ‘Classification and Terminology in Australian Rock Art’. In (ed) P. J. Ucko Form in Indigenous Rock Art, Prehistory and Material Culture. Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra, 13:387–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 2,000 rock engraving sites, which are usually located on highly elevated, smooth and flat surfaces. More than half of the engraving sites (55.9%) are located on ridgelines. Hillside locations are the next most frequent (41.2%), while [[valley]] bottoms are comparatively rare (2.8%). The average distance to drinking water from any engraving site in the region is 650m and the maximum distance is approximately 3km. The minimum distance is 2m (rock wells or creeks).&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, F. D. 1959. ‘Rock Engravings of the Sydney-Hawkesbury District (Part 2): Some Important Ritual Groups in the County of Cumberland’.

'''Motu Tane''' (which in Tahitian translates as Man's Island), is a {{convert|9.6|acre|km2|3|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[private island]] in the [[lagoon]] of [[Bora Bora]] in [[French Polynesia]].
It is the located between [[Paahi (Bora Bora)|Paahi]], and [[Pitoraverahi (Bora Bora)|Pitoraverahi]].

==History==
Motu Tane is well known in Bora Bora as having been [[Paul-Emile Victor]]'s home. Paul-Emile Victor was the famous French polar explorer and author and chose as his personal paradise refuge Motu Tane in Bora Bora, to live a peaceful and secluded life.

The island has coconut groves, encircled by a white sand beach with just beyond Polynesia's sparkling turquoise blue waters. 
in 1997, it was purchased by [[NARS Cosmetics|François Nars]], artistic director of the well-known cosmetic brand that he founded and carries his own name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/francois-nars-is-selling-his-island-in-bora-bora| title= Nars Island| accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Administration==
The island is part of [[Bora Bora Commune]].

==Tourism==
The island is up for sale &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.privateislandsonline.com/south-pacific/frenchpolynesia/motu-tane2| title= Vladi real estate| accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==

After arriving in [[Fa'a'ā International Airport]], an [[Air Tahiti]] inter-island flight (50 minutes) will bring you to [[Bora Bora Airport]].

There, you will need to hire a boat at the [[Rent-a-boat]] Office.

A '''teacher''' (also called a '''school teacher''' or, in some contexts, an '''educator''') is a person who helps others to acquire [[knowledge]], competences or values.

''Informally'' the role of teacher may be taken on by anyone (e.g. when showing a colleague how to perform a specific task). 
In some countries, teaching young people of school age may be carried out in an informal setting, such as within the family ([[homeschooling]]), rather than in a formal setting such as a school or college. 
Some other professions may involve a significant amount of teaching (e.g. youth worker, pastor).

In most countries, ''formal'' teaching of [[student]]s is usually carried out by paid [[professional]] teachers. This article focuses on those who are ''employed'', as their main role, to teach others in a ''formal'' [[education]] context, such as at a [[school]] or other place of ''initial'' formal education or training.

==Duties and functions==
[[File:LDAI 2002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Chilean schoolchildren during a class photograph with their teacher, 2002]]
A teacher's role may vary among cultures.

Teachers may provide instruction in [[Literacy education|literacy]] and [[numeracy]], [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] or [[vocational training]], [[the arts]], [[religion]], [[civics]], community roles, or life skills.

Formal teaching tasks include preparing lessons according to agreed curricula, giving lessons, and assessing pupil progress.

A teacher's professional duties may extend beyond formal teaching. Outside of the classroom teachers may accompany students on field trips, supervise [[study hall]]s, help with the organization of school functions, and serve as supervisors for [[extracurricular activities]]. 
In some education systems, teachers may have responsibility for student [[discipline]].

==Competences and qualities required by teachers==

Teaching is a highly complex activity.&lt;ref name="Caena"&gt;For a review of literature on competences required by teachers, see F Caena (2011) 'Literature review: Teachers’ core competences:  
requirements and development' accessed January 2017 at {{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109184019/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is in part because teaching is a social practice, that takes place in a specific context (time, place, culture, socio-political-economic situation etc.) and therefore reflects the values of that specific context.&lt;ref name="Cochrane"&gt;for a useful discussion see, for example: Cochran-Smith,  M.  (2006): 'Policy,  Practice,  and  Politics  in  Teacher  Education',  Thousand  Oaks,  CA:  Corwin Press&lt;/ref&gt; Factors that influence what is expected (or required) of teachers include history and tradition, social views about the purpose of education, accepted theories about learning, etc.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;see for example Cummings, W.K. (2003) 'The   Institutions   of   Education.  A   Comparative   Study   of   Educational Development in the Six Core Nations', Providence, MA:
Symposium Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competences===
The competencies required by a teacher are affected by the different ways in which the role is understood around the world. Broadly, there seem to be four models: 
:the teacher as manager of instruction; 
:the teacher as caring person; 
:the teacher as expert learner; and 
:the teacher as cultural and civic person.&lt;ref name="Caena2"&gt;F Caena (2011) 'Literature review: Teachers’ core competences: requirements and development' accessed January 2017 at {{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109184019/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }} citing Altet et al., 1996; Conway et al., 2010; Hansen, 2008; Seifert, 1999; Sockett, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OECD]] has argued that it is necessary to develop a  shared  definition  of  the skills  and  knowledge required by teachers, in order to guide  teachers' career-long education and professional development.&lt;ref name ="OECD"&gt;'Teachers  Matter:  Attracting,  Developing  and  Retaining  Effective Teachers', 2005, Paris: OECD publications [http://www.oecd.org/edu/teacherpolicy]&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence-based international discussions have tried to reach such a common understanding. For example, the [[European Union]] has identified three broad areas of competences that teachers require:
:Working with others
:Working with knowledge, technology and information, and
:Working in and with society.&lt;ref name="Caena3"&gt;F Caena (2011) 'Literature review: Teachers’ core competences: requirements and development' accessed January 2017 at {{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109184019/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/strategic-framework/doc/teacher-competences_en.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly consensus is emerging that what is required of teachers can be grouped under three headings:
:knowledge (such as: the subject matter itself and knowledge about how to teach it, curricular knowledge, knowledge about the educational sciences, psychology, assessment etc.) 
:craft skills (such as lesson planning, using teaching technologies, managing students and groups, monitoring and assessing learning etc.) and 
:dispositions (such as essential values and attitudes, beliefs and commitment).&lt;ref name="Will"&gt;Williamson  McDiarmid, G.  &amp;  Clevenger-Bright  M.  (2008) 'Rethinking  Teacher  Capacity', in  Cochran-Smith,  M.,  Feiman-Nemser,  S.  &amp;  Mc  Intyre,  D.  (Eds.).  'Handbook  of  Research  on  
Teacher  Education. Enduring questions in changing contexts'. New York/Abingdon: Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis cited in F Caena (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualities===

====Enthusiasm====

[[File:Ashs-teacher-and-students.jpg|thumb|A teacher interacts with older students at a school in New Zealand]]

It has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can create a positive learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching Patterns: a Pattern Language for Improving the Quality of Instruction in Higher Education Settings by Daren Olson. Page 96&lt;/ref&gt; These teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course materials on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;Motivated Student: Unlocking the Enthusiasm for Learning by Bob Sullo. Page 62&lt;/ref&gt; One of the challenges facing teachers is that they may have repeatedly covered a curriculum until they begin to feel bored with the subject, and their attitude may in turn bore the students. Students who had enthusiastic teachers tend to rate them higher than teachers who didn't show much enthusiasm for the course materials.&lt;ref&gt;Barkley, S., &amp; Bianco, T. (2006). The Wonder of Wows. Kappa Delta Pi Record, 42(4), 148-151.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|A primary school teacher on a picnic with her students, [[Colombia]], 2014]]
Teachers that exhibit enthusiasm can lead to students who are more likely to be engaged, interested, energetic, and curious about learning the subject matter. Recent research has found a correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Patrick, B.C., Hisley, J. &amp; Kempler, T. (2000) "What's Everybody so Excited about?": The Effects of Teacher Enthusiasm on Student Intrinsic Motivation and Vitality", The Journal of Experimental Education, Vol. 68, No. 3, pp. 217-236&lt;/ref&gt; Controlled, experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm, such as demonstrative gesturing, dramatic movements which are varied, and emotional facial expressions, result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=Douglas M.|title=The Teacher's Communicative Competence: The First Day of School|journal=Theory Into Practice|date=1985|volume=24|issue=1|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even while a teacher's enthusiasm has been shown to improve motivation and increase task engagement, it does not necessarily improve learning outcomes or memory for the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Motz|first1=B. A.|last2=de Leeuw|first2=J. R.|last3=Carvalho|first3=P. F.|last4=Liang|first4=K. L.|last5=Goldstone|first5=R. L.|title=A dissociation between engagement and learning: Enthusiastic instructions fail to reliably improve performance on a memory task|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2017|volume=12|issue=7|page=e0181775|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0181775|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181775|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930092450/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0181775|archivedate=30 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various mechanisms by which teacher enthusiasm may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.in/dr-anil-k-rajvanshi/all-of-us-should-be-teachers-even-if-just-for-one-day/ All Of Us Should Be Teachers, Even If Just For One Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009112708/http://www.huffingtonpost.in/dr-anil-k-rajvanshi/all-of-us-should-be-teachers-even-if-just-for-one-day/ |date=9 October 2016 }}, Huffington Post, 27 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 
Teacher enthusiasm may contribute to a classroom atmosphere of energy and enthusiasm which feeds student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Amatora, M. (1950). Teacher Personality: Its Influence on Pupils. Education, 71(3), 154-158&lt;/ref&gt;  Enthusiastic teachers may also lead to students becoming more self-determined in their own learning process. The concept of mere exposure indicates that the teacher's enthusiasm may contribute to the student's expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of learning.  Also, enthusiasm may act as a "motivational embellishment", increasing a student's interest by the variety, novelty, and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher's presentation of the material. Finally, the concept of emotional contagion, may also apply; students may become more intrinsically motivated by catching onto the enthusiasm and energy of the teacher.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Interaction with learners====
Research shows that student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student-teacher relationships. Enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students. Their ability to create effective learning environments that foster student achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, J. A., Terry, T., Bridger, R., &amp; Winsor, A. (1997). Schools as caring communities: A relational approach to school reform. School Psychology Review, 26, 576-588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant, Jennings 1980"&gt;Bryant, Jennings . 1980. Relationship between college teachers' use of humor in the classroom and students' evaluations of their teachers. Journal of educational psychology. 72, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, B. J., &amp; Fisher, D. L. (1982). Predicting students' outcomes from their perceptions of classroom psychosocial environment. American Educational Research Journal, 19, 498- 518.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartmut, J. 1978"&gt;Hartmut, J. (1978). Supportive dimensions of teacher behavior in relationship to pupil emotional cognitive processes. Psychologie in Erziehung und Unterricht, 25, 69-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Useful teacher-to-student interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement.&lt;ref name="Osborne, E. 1999"&gt;Osborne, E.;. Salzberger, I.; Wittenberg, G. W. 1999. The Emotional Experience of Learning and Teaching.  Karnac Books, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, personal success is a student's internal goal of improving himself, whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior. A teacher must guide her student in aligning her personal goals with her academic goals. Students who receive this positive influence show stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions.&lt;ref name="Hartmut, J. 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baker, J. A.Teacher-Student Interaction in Urban At-Risk Classrooms: Differential Behavior, Relationship Quality, and Student Satisfaction with School. The Elementary School Journal Volume 100, Number 1, 1999 by The University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moos, R. H. (1979). Evaluating Educational Environments: Measures, procedures, findings, and policy implications. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are likely to build stronger relations with teachers who are friendly and supportive and will show more interest in courses taught by these teachers.&lt;ref name="Osborne, E. 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Teachers that spend more time interacting and working directly with students are perceived as supportive and effective teachers. Effective teachers have been shown to invite student participation and decision making, allow humor into their classroom, and demonstrate a willingness to play.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Jennings 1980"/&gt;

==Teaching qualifications==
In many countries, a person who wishes to become a teacher must first obtain [[Certified teacher|specified professional qualifications or credentials]] from a [[university]] or [[college]]. These professional qualifications may include the study of [[pedagogy]], the science of teaching. 
Teachers, like other professionals, may have to, or choose to, continue their education after they qualify, a process known as [[continuing professional development]].

The issue of teacher qualifications is linked to the status of the profession. In some societies, teachers enjoy a status on a par with [[physician]]s, [[lawyer]]s, [[engineer]]s, and [[accountants]], in others, the status of the profession is low. In the twentieth century, many intelligent women were unable to get jobs in corporations or governments so many chose teaching as a default profession. As women become more welcomed into corporations and governments today, it may be more difficult to attract qualified teachers in the future.

Teachers are often required to undergo a course of initial education at a  [[College of Education]] to ensure that they possess the necessary knowledge, competences and adhere to relevant [[Ethical code|codes of ethics]].

There are a variety of bodies designed to instill, preserve and update the knowledge and professional standing of teachers. Around the world many teachers' colleges exist; they may be controlled by government or by the teaching profession itself.

They are generally established to serve and protect the public interest through [[certify]]ing, governing, quality controlling, and enforcing standards of practice for the teaching profession.

===Professional standards===
The functions of the teachers' colleges may include setting out clear standards of practice, providing for the ongoing education of teachers, investigating complaints involving members, conducting hearings into [[allegation]]s of professional misconduct and taking appropriate disciplinary action and [[accredit]]ing teacher education programs. In many situations teachers in [[Public school (government funded)|publicly funded schools]] must be members in good standing with the college, and [[private school]]s may also require their teachers to be college members. In other areas these roles may belong to the State [[Board of Education]], the [[Superintendent of Public Instruction]], the [[State Education Agency]] or other governmental bodies. In still other areas [[Teaching Union]]s may be responsible for some or all of these duties.

====Professional misconduct====
{{See also|Child abuse}}

Misconduct by teachers, especially [[sexual misconduct]], has been getting increased scrutiny from the media and the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goorian |first=Brad |date=December 1999 |title=Sexual Misconduct by School Employees |journal=[[ERIC|ERIC Digest]] |issue=134 |page=1 |id=ERIC #: ED436816 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/15/fd/90.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate= 2008-01-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227085217/http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/15/fd/90.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the [[American Association of University Women]] reported that 9.6% of students in the United States claim to have received unwanted sexual attention from an adult associated with education; be they a volunteer, bus driver, teacher, administrator or other adult; sometime during their educational career.&lt;ref name=DOEd&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf#p28 |title=Educator Sexual Misconduct: A Synthesis of Existing Literature |accessdate=2008-01-17 |last=Shakeshaft |first=Charol |date=June 2004 |format=PDF |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Education]], Office of the Under Secretary |page=28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411133905/http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf#p28 |archivedate=11 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in England showed a 0.3% prevalence of sexual abuse by any professional, a group that included [[priest]]s, religious leaders, and case workers as well as teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf#p28 Educator Sexual Misconduct: A Synthesis of Existing Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411133905/http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf |date=11 April 2008 }} see page 8 and page 20&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note, however, that this British study is the only one of its kind and consisted of "a random ... probability sample of 2,869 young people between the ages of 18 and 24 in a computer-assisted study" and that the questions referred to "sexual abuse with a professional," not necessarily a teacher. It is therefore logical to conclude that information on the percentage of abuses by teachers in the United Kingdom is not explicitly available and therefore not necessarily reliable. The AAUW study, however, posed questions about fourteen types of sexual harassment and various degrees of frequency and included only abuses by teachers. "The sample was drawn from a list of 80,000 schools to create a stratified two-stage sample design of 2,065 8th to 11th grade students". Its reliability was gauged at 95% with a 4% margin of error.

In the [[United States]] especially, several high-profile cases such as [[Debra LaFave]], [[Pamela Rogers]], and [[Mary Kay Letourneau]] have caused increased scrutiny on teacher misconduct.

[[Chris Keates]], the general secretary of [[National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers]], said that teachers who have sex with pupils over the age of consent should not be placed on the sex offenders register and that prosecution for statutory rape "is a real anomaly in the law that we are concerned about." This has led to outrage from child protection and parental rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,432881,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Union Official: Teachers Who Engage in Consensual Sex With Teen Pupils Shouldn't Face Prosecution | date=6 October 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010220256/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,432881,00.html | archivedate=10 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fears of being labelled a [[pedophile]] or [[hebephile]] has led to several men who enjoy teaching avoiding the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kissen|first1=Rita|title=Getting Ready for Benjamin: Preparing Teachers for Sexual Diversity in the classroom|date=2002|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has in some jurisdictions reportedly led to a shortage of [[male]] teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s72521.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030822201605/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s72521.htm |archivedate=22 August 2003 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Pedagogy]] and teaching==
{{Main|Pedagogy}}

[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 007.jpg|thumb|Dutch schoolmaster and children, 1662]]
[[File:Teacher in Laos.jpg|thumb|A primary school teacher in northern [[Laos]]]]
[[File:Rostock Schmidt Lehrer-Student.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The teacher-student-monument in [[Rostock]], Germany, honors teachers]]

Teachers facilitate [[student]] learning, often in a [[school]] or academy or perhaps in another environment such as [[Outdoor education|outdoors]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-13055-0008, Hohendorf, JP mit Dorflehrer.jpg|thumb|[[East Germany|GDR]] "village teacher", a teacher teaching students of all age groups in one class in 1951]]
[[File:Jewish Children with their Teacher in Samarkand cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jew]]ish children with their teacher in [[Samarkand]], the beginning of the 20th century.]]
The objective is typically accomplished through either an [[Informal learning|informal]] or formal approach to learning, including a course of study and [[lesson plan]] that teaches [[skill]]s, [[knowledge]] or [[thinking]] skills. Different ways to teach are often referred to as [[pedagogy]]. When deciding what teaching method to use teachers consider students' background knowledge, environment, and their learning goals as well as standardized [[curricula]] as determined by the relevant authority. Many times, teachers assist in learning outside of the classroom by accompanying students on field trips. The increasing use of [[technology]], specifically the rise of the [[internet]] over the past decade, has begun to shape the way teachers approach their roles in the [[classroom]].

The [[goal|objective]] is typically a course of study, [[lesson plan]], or a practical skill. A teacher may follow standardized [[Curriculum|curricula]] as determined by the relevant authority. The teacher may interact with students of different ages, from infants to [[adults]], students with different abilities and students with learning [[disabilities]].

Teaching using pedagogy also involve assessing the educational levels of the students on particular skills. Understanding the pedagogy of the students in a classroom involves using [[differentiated instruction]] as well as supervision to meet the needs of all students in the classroom. Pedagogy can be thought of in two manners. First, teaching itself can be taught in many different ways, hence, using a [[pedagogy of teaching styles]]. Second, the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when a teacher assesses the pedagogic diversity of his/her students and differentiates for the [[individual]] students accordingly. For example, an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows: "The real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop. The function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy, inspire the bored, deflate the cocky, encourage the timid, detect and correct individual flaws, and broaden the viewpoint of all. This function looks like that of a coach using the whole gamut of psychology to get each new class of rookies off the bench and into the game."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Evans (1965) letter to Roy Glasgow of Naval Postgraduate School, quoted by his son Gregory Walter Evans (December 2004) "Bringing Root Locus to the Classroom", [[IEEE Control Systems Magazine]], page 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most significant difference between [[primary school]] and [[secondary school]] teaching is the relationship between teachers and children. In primary schools each class has a teacher who stays with them for most of the week and will teach them the whole curriculum. In secondary schools they will be taught by different subject specialists each session during the week and may have ten or more different teachers. The relationship between children and their teachers tends to be closer in the primary school where they act as form tutor, specialist teacher and surrogate parent during the course of the day.

This is true throughout most of the United States as well. However, alternative approaches for primary education do exist. One of these, sometimes referred to as a "platoon" system, involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject. The advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects. Students still derive a strong sense of security by staying with the same group of peers for all classes.

[[Co-teaching]] has also become a new trend amongst educational institutions. Co-teaching is defined as two or more teachers working harmoniously to fulfill the needs of every student in the classroom. Co-teaching focuses the student on learning by providing a [[social networking]] support that allows them to reach their full cognitive potential. Co-teachers work in sync with one another to create a climate of learning.

===Classroom management===

====Teachers and school discipline====
{{Main|School discipline|School punishment}}

Throughout the [[history of education]] the most common form of [[school discipline]] was [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]]. While a child was in school, a teacher was expected to act as a [[in loco parentis|substitute parent]], with all the normal forms of parental discipline open to them. [[File:Koerperstrafe- MA Birkenrute.png|thumb|Medieval schoolboy birched on the bare buttocks]]

In past times, corporal punishment ([[spanking]] or [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] or [[caning]] or [[Strapping (punishment)|strapping]] or [[birching]] the student in order to cause physical pain) was one of the most common forms of school discipline throughout much of the world. Most Western countries, and some others, have now banned it, but it remains lawful in the [[United States]] following a US Supreme Court decision in 1977 which held that paddling did not violate the US Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bucknell.edu/x4615.xml |title=Ingraham v. Wright |publisher=Bucknell.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908060547/http://www.bucknell.edu/x4615.xml |archivedate=8 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

30 US states have banned corporal punishment, the others (mostly in [[Southern United States|the South]]) have not. It is still used to a significant (though declining) degree in some public schools in [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Texas]]. Private schools in these and most other states may also use it. Corporal punishment in American schools is administered to the seat of the student's trousers or skirt with a specially made wooden paddle. This often used to take place in the classroom or hallway, but nowadays the punishment is usually given privately in the principal's office.

Official corporal punishment, often by [[caning]], remains commonplace in schools in some [[Asia]]n, [[Africa]]n and [[Caribbean]] countries. For details of individual countries see [[School corporal punishment]].

Currently detention is one of the most common punishments in schools in the [[United States]], the [[UK]], [[Ireland]], [[Singapore]] and other countries. It requires the pupil to remain in school at a given time in the school day (such as lunch, recess or after school); or even to attend school on a non-school day, e.g. "Saturday detention" held at some schools. During detention, students normally have to sit in a classroom and do work, write lines or a punishment essay, or sit quietly.

A modern example of school discipline in [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]] relies upon the idea of an assertive teacher who is prepared to impose their will upon a class. Positive reinforcement is balanced with immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior and firm, clear boundaries define what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Teachers are expected to respect their students; sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils are seen as falling outside of what constitutes reasonable discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feaonline.org/media/members/onepapers/Maintaining_Classroom_Discipline.pdf|title=Maintaining Classroom Discipline|last=|first=|date=|website=Federal Education Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst this is the consensus viewpoint amongst the majority of academics, some teachers and parents advocate a more assertive and confrontational style of discipline&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classroom Management: Sound Theory and Effective Practice|last=Tauber|first=Robert T.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|isbn=9780275996680|location=|pages= 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; (refer to ''Canter Model of Discipline'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/dcheney/EDSPE503ClassroomManagement/Readings/CanterChapter.pdf|title=Building Classroom Discipline|last=Charles|first=C.M|date=2005|website=University of Washington|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals claim that many problems with modern schooling stem from the weakness in school discipline and if teachers exercised firm control over the classroom they would be able to teach more efficiently. This viewpoint is supported by the educational attainment of countries—in [[East Asia]] for instance—that combine strict discipline with high standards of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/IJEM-09-2015-0118?journalCode=ijem|title=School discipline, school uniforms and academic performance|last=Baumann|first=Chris|date=2016|website=Emerald Insight|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hkier.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/journal/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/erj_v24n2_327-348.pdf|title=Characteristics of East Asian Learners: What We Learned From PISA|last=Sui-chu Ho|first=Esther|date=2009|website=hkier.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/strict-classroom-discipline-improves-student-outcomes-and-work-ethic-studies-find-20161108-gsksiq.html|title=Strict classroom discipline improves student outcomes and work ethic, studies find|last=Munro|first=Kelsey|date=November 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317101745/https://www.smh.com.au/education/strict-classroom-discipline-improves-student-outcomes-and-work-ethic-studies-find-20161108-gsksiq.html|archive-date=2018-03-17|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's not clear, however that this stereotypical view reflects the reality of East Asian classrooms or that the educational goals in these countries are commensurable with those in Western countries. In [[Japan]], for example, although average attainment on standardized tests may exceed those in Western countries, classroom discipline and behavior is highly problematic. Although, officially, schools have extremely rigid codes of behavior, in practice many teachers find the students unmanageable and do not enforce discipline at all.

Where school class sizes are typically 40 to 50 students, maintaining order in the classroom can divert the teacher from instruction, leaving little opportunity for concentration and focus on what is being taught. In response, teachers may concentrate their attention on motivated students, ignoring [[attention-seeking]] and disruptive students. The result of this is that motivated students, facing demanding university entrance examinations, receive disproportionate resources. Given the emphasis on attainment of university places, administrators and governors may regard this policy as appropriate.

====Obligation to honor students rights====
{{Main|School discipline#Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools|l1=Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools}}

[[Sudbury model]] democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike. They also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else. Primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole, thence the school atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation, rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront. Sudbury model democratic schools' proponents argue that a school that has good, clear laws, fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community, and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws, is a school in which community discipline prevails, and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops, against other schools today, where rules are arbitrary, authority is absolute, punishment is capricious, and [[due process of law]] is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;The Crisis in American Education&amp;nbsp;— An Analysis and a Proposal, [http://www.sudval.com/05_onepersononevote.html#02 The Sudbury Valley School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511180710/http://www.sudval.com/05_onepersononevote.html |date=11 May 2011 }} (1970), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MAqxzEss8k4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=The+Crisis+in+American+Education+%E2%80%94+An+Analysis+and+a+Proposal,+The+Sudbury+Valley+School+(1970),+Law+and+Order:+Foundations+of+Discipline ''Law and Order: Foundations of Discipline''] (pg. 49-55).

== Occupational hazards ==
{{Main|Occupational hazard}}
Teachers face several occupational hazards in their line of work, including [[occupational stress]], which can negatively impact teachers' mental and physical health, productivity, and students' performance. Stress can be caused by organizational change, relationships with students, fellow teachers, and administrative personnel, working environment, expectations to substitute, long hours with a heavy workload, and inspections. Teachers are also at high risk for [[occupational burnout]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work-related stress in teachers|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2015|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 25851427|pages = CD010306|volume = 4|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010306.pub2|first = Ali|last = Naghieh|first2 = Paul|last2 = Montgomery|first3 = Christopher P.|last3 = Bonell|first4 = Marc|last4 = Thompson|first5 = J. Lawrence|last5 = Aber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 study found that 42% of UK teachers experienced occupational stress, twice the figure for the average profession. A 2012 study found that teachers experienced double the rate of anxiety, depression, and stress than average workers.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

There are several ways to mitigate the occupational hazards of teaching. Organizational interventions, like changing teachers' schedules, providing support networks and mentoring, changing the work environment, and offering promotions and bonuses, may be effective in helping to reduce occupational stress among teachers. Individual-level interventions, including stress-management training and counseling, are also used to relieve occupational stress among teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Apart from this, teachers are often not given sufficient opportunities for professional growth or promotions. This leads to some stagnancy, as there is not sufficient interests to enter the profession. An organisation in India called Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) is working to reduce this hazard, by trying to open opportunities for teachers in India.

==Teaching around the world==
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - 6 24 - School for adults in Guinea-Bissau - 1974.tiff|thumb|Teacher and pupils in liberated [[Guinea-Bissau]], 1974.]]
[[File:Agnar O.P. Strandberg 1964.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Math and physics teacher at a junior college in [[Sweden]], in the 1960s]]
There are many similarities and differences among teachers around the world. In almost all countries teachers are educated in a [[university]] or [[college]]. Governments may require [[Certified teacher|certification]] by a recognized body before they can teach in a [[school]]. In many countries, elementary school education certificate is earned after completion of high school. The high school student follows an education specialty track, obtain the prerequisite "student-teaching" time, and receive a special diploma to begin teaching after graduation. In addition to certification, many educational institutions especially within the US, require that prospective teachers pass a background check and psychiatric evaluation to be able to teach in classroom. This is not always the case with adult further learning institutions but is fast becoming the norm in many countries as security&lt;ref name="Osborne, E. 1999" /&gt; concerns grow.

[[International school]]s generally follow an English-speaking, Western curriculum and are aimed at expatriate communities.&lt;ref name="intschools"&gt;{{cite web |last=''Teachers International Consultancy'' |title=Teaching at international schools is not TEFL |date=17 July 2008 |url=http://www.ticrecruitment.com/contentpage.php?pageid=14 |accessdate=2009-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209225547/http://www.ticrecruitment.com/contentpage.php?pageid=14 |archivedate=9 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Education in Australia}}

Education in Australia is primarily the responsibility of the individual [[states and territories of Australia|states and territories]]. Generally, education in Australia follows the three-tier model which includes [[primary education]] (primary schools), followed by [[secondary education]] (secondary schools/high schools) and [[tertiary education]] (universities or [[Technical and further education|TAFE]] colleges).

===Canada===
{{Main|Education in Canada}}

Teaching in [[Canada]] requires a post-secondary degree [[Bachelor's Degree]]. In most provinces a second [[Bachelor's Degree]] such as a [[Bachelor of Education]] is required to become a qualified teacher. Salary ranges from $40,000/year to $90,000/yr. Teachers have the option to teach for a public school which is funded by the provincial government or teaching in a private school which is funded by the private sector, businesses and sponsors.

===France===
{{Main|Education in France}}

In [[France]], teachers, or ''professors'', are mainly civil servants, recruited by [[competitive examination]].

===Germany===
{{Main|Education in Germany}}

In [[Germany]], teachers are mainly civil servants recruited in special university classes, called ''Lehramtstudien'' (''Teaching Education Studies''). There are many differences between the teachers for elementary schools (''Grundschule''), lower secondary schools (''Hauptschule''), middle level secondary schools (''Realschule'') and higher level secondary schools (''Gymnasium'').
Salaries for teachers depend on the civil servants' salary index scale (''Bundesbesoldungsordnung'').

===India===
{{See also|Gurukula|Education in India}}
In ancient India, the most common form of education was [[gurukula]] based on the [[Guru–shishya tradition|guru-shishya tradition]] (teacher-disciple tradition) which involved the disciple and guru living in the same (or a nearby) residence. These ''gurukulam'' was supported by public donations and the guru would not accept any fees from the ''shishya''. This organized system stayed the most prominent form of education in the [[Indian subcontinent]] until the British invasion. Through strong efforts in 1886 and 1948, the gurukula system was revived in India.&lt;ref&gt;Madalsa Ujjwal, 2008, "Swami Dayanand Saraswati Life and Ideas", Book Treasure Publications, Jodhpur, PP.96-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, Ankur; Gupta, Rajen K. (July 2017). "Elementary education in Bharat (that is India): insights from a postcolonial ethnographic study of a Gurukul". ''International Journal of Indian Culture and Business Management''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role and success of a teacher in the modern Indian education system is clearly defined. CENTA Standards define the competencies that a good teacher should possess. Schools look for competent teachers across grades. Teachers are appointed directly by schools in private sector, and through eligibility tests in government schools.

===Ireland===
{{Main|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}

Salaries for primary teachers in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] depend mainly on seniority (i.e. holding the position of [[principal (school)|principal]], deputy principal or [[assistant principal]]), experience and qualifications. Extra pay is also given for teaching through the [[Irish language]], in a [[Gaeltacht]] area or on an [[islands of Ireland|island]]. The basic pay for a starting teacher is €27,814 [[Per annum|p.a.]], rising incrementally to €53,423 for a teacher with 25 years service. A principal of a large school with many years experience and several qualifications ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[H.Dip.]], etc.) could earn over €90,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circular 0040/2011 (New Pay Scales for New Appointees to Teaching in 2011)|url=http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0040_2011.pdf|publisher=Department of Education, Ireland|accessdate=23 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606211440/http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0040_2011.pdf|archivedate=6 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
{{Main|Education in Scotland}}

In [[Scotland]], anyone wishing to teach must be registered with the [[General Teaching Council for Scotland]] (GTCS). Teaching in Scotland is an all graduate profession and the normal route for graduates wishing to teach is to complete a programme of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) at one of the seven Scottish Universities who offer these courses. Once successfully completed, "Provisional Registration" is given by the GTCS which is raised to "Full Registration" status after a year if there is sufficient evidence to show that the "Standard for Full Registration" has been met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtcs.org.uk/Becoming_a_Teacher/Trainingtobeateacher/Trainingtobeateacher.asp Training to be a teacher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129112253/http://www.gtcs.org.uk/Becoming_a_Teacher/Trainingtobeateacher/Trainingtobeateacher.asp |date=29 January 2008 }} GTC Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

For the salary year beginning April 2008, unpromoted teachers in [[Scotland]] earned from £20,427 for a Probationer, up to £32,583 after 6 years teaching, but could then go on to earn up to £39,942 as they complete the modules to earn Chartered Teacher Status (requiring at least 6 years at up to two modules per year.) Promotion to [[Principal Teacher]] positions attracts a salary of between £34,566 and £44,616; Deputy Head, and [[Head teacher]]s earn from £40,290 to £78,642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tes.com/articles/scotland-headteachers-and-deputy-headteachers-pay|title=Scotland: Headteachers and deputy headteachers' pay|author=|date=31 May 2016|website=Tes|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914091403/https://www.tes.com/articles/scotland-headteachers-and-deputy-headteachers-pay|archivedate=14 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wales====
{{Main|Education in Wales}}

Education in Wales differs in certain respects from education elsewhere in the United Kingdom. For example, a significant number of students all over Wales are educated either wholly or largely through the medium of Welsh: in 2008/09, 22 per cent of classes in maintained primary schools used Welsh as the sole or main medium of instruction. Welsh medium education is available to all age groups through nurseries, schools, colleges and universities and in adult education; lessons in the language itself are compulsory for all pupils until the age of 16.

Teachers in [[Wales]] can be registered members of [[trade unions]] such as [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers|ATL]], [[National Union of Teachers|NUT]] or [[NASUWT]] and reports in recent years suggest that the average age of teachers in Wales is falling with teachers being younger than in previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8630117.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wales' teachers 'getting younger' | date=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing cause of concern are that attacks on teachers in Welsh schools which reached an all-time high between 2005 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11476605 | work=BBC News | title=Attacks on teachers in Wales on the rise | date=7 October 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123173859/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11476605 | archivedate=23 November 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], each [[U.S. state|state]] determines the requirements for getting a license to teach in public schools. Teaching certification generally lasts three years, but teachers can receive certificates that last as long as ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teacherportal.com/teaching-certification |title=Teacher certification |publisher=Teacherportal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720050328/http://teacherportal.com/teaching-certification |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public school teachers are required to have a bachelor's degree and the majority must be certified by the state in which they teach. Many [[charter schools]] do not require that their teachers be certified, provided they meet the standards to be highly qualified as set by [[No Child Left Behind]]. Additionally, the requirements for substitute/temporary teachers are generally not as rigorous as those for full-time professionals.

In the past, teachers have been paid relatively low salaries. However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was [[USD|$]]46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000.

Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school.

==Assistant teachers==
Assistant teachers are additional teachers assisting the primary teacher, often in the same classroom.  There are different types around the world, as well as a variety of formal programs defining roles and responsibilities.

One type is a [[Foreign Language Assistant]], which in Germany is run by the Educational Exchange Service ([[:de:Pädagogischer Austauschdienst|Pädagogischer Austauschdienst]]).

British schools employ [[Teaching assistant (United Kingdom)|teaching assistants]], who are not considered fully qualified teachers, and as such, are guided by teachers but may supervise and teach groups of pupils independently. In the United Kingdom, the term "assistant teacher" used to be used to refer to any qualified or unqualified teacher who was not a head or deputy head teacher.{{Original research inline|date=September 2017}}

The Japanese education system employs [[Assistant Language Teacher]]s in elementary, junior high and high schools.

[[Learning by teaching]] ([[German language|German]] short form: LdL) is a method which allows pupils and students to prepare and teach lessons or parts of lessons, with the understanding that a student's own learning is enhanced through the teaching process.

'''''The Invasion of 1910''''' is a 1906 novel written mainly by [[William Le Queux]] (along with [[Herbert Wrigley Wilson|H. W. Wilson]] providing the naval chapters). It is one of the most famous examples of [[invasion literature]]. It is viewed by some as an example of pre-World War I [[Anti-German sentiment|Germanophobia]]. It can also be viewed as prescient, as it preached the need to prepare for war with Germany.

==Background==
The novel was originally commissioned by [[Alfred Harmsworth]] as a serial which appeared in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' from 19 March 1906. According to historian of Germany [[Richard J. Evans|Sir Richard Evans]], the paper built up "mass alarm" by dressing its London newspaper vendors as Prussian soldiers complete with [[pickelhaube]] helmet and placards showing maps of where the 'troops' would be next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Riddle of the sands|series=In Our Time|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00bzdg4|minutes=36|date=12 June 2008|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rewrite of the story, featuring towns and villages with large readership of the ''Daily Mail'',&lt;ref&gt;

St. Barbe | title = The Real Le Queux: The Official Biography | publisher = Nicholson &amp; Watson | location = London | year = 1938 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Le Queux's dismay, a pirated and abridged German translation (with an altered ending) appeared the same year: ''Die Invasion von 1910: Einfall der Deutschen in England'' translated by Traugott Tamm.&lt;ref name=sladen/&gt;

In Le Queux's earlier novel, ''[[The Great War in England in 1897]]'', it is France which invades Britain as an implacable enemy. In that book's plot, German soldiers land in Britain as allies coming to help repulse the French invasion, and are welcomed as saviours. In between Le Queux's two disparate depictions of an invaded Britain, the [[Entente Cordiale]] of 1904 changed the diplomatic and military landscape.

==Outline==
The book takes the form of a military history and includes excerpts from the characters' journals and letters and descriptions of the fictional German campaign itself.

It is centred on an invasion by the Germans, who have managed to land a sizeable invasion force on the East Coast of England. They advance inland, cutting all telegraph lines and despoiling farmland as they go, and the British struggle to mount a proper defence, fighting a battle at [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]]. The Germans eventually reach London and occupy half the city. A junior [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] declares that "Britain is not defeated" and organises a resistance movement, the "League of Defenders," despite harsh reprisals by the Germans and a severe lack of arms. The Germans seem unable to combat this and tighten their control of London and suddenly find themselves faced with a popular uprising. Eventually, a newly formed [[British Army]] marches to liberate London. The fictional war, however, is a stalemate since it appears that German forces have managed to occupy [[Belgium]] and [[the Netherlands]].

==Agenda==
The failure of the British government to prepare for a possible invasion is repeatedly mentioned, as is the phrase "they should have listened to Lord Roberts", along with many references to Roberts' patriotism. It is also pointed out that the invasion might have been counteracted more easily if every able-bodied man had had military training. Le Queux himself stated that one of his aims was to "bring home to the British public vividly and forcibly what really would occur were an enemy suddenly to appear in our midst".

==Film version==
Le Queux's novel attracted the attention of the [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont Cinematograph Company]] in 1912, who planned to change the title to ''The Raid of 1915'' and to film two endings, one with Britain as the victor and one with Germany as the victor. The British satirical magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' suggested they show the Britain victorious version in Germany and the other version in Britain. The film was finished in 1913 but its release was delayed by the [[British Board of Film Censors]] and when it was finally released in October 1914 (three months after the start of [[World War I]]), it had again been retitled, to ''If England were Invaded''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Waller | first = Philip J. | title = Writers, Readers, and Reputations: Literary Life in Britain 1870–1918 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2006 | pages = 9 | isbn = 0-19-820677-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sekhmet Hypothesis''''' was first published in book form in 1995 by Iain Spence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Spence | first1 = Iain| title = The Sekhmet Hypothesis| publisher = Bast's Blend| date = 1995| isbn = 9780952536505}}&lt;/ref&gt; It suggested that pop trends of an atavistic nature could be analysed in relation to Timothy Leary's [[Interpersonal_circumplex|Interpersonal Circumplex Grid]]. It also suggested that major youth trends could be correlated to peaks in the 11 year solar cycle; this idea was later rejected by the author in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Iain (2012). ''The Hare Hypothesis''. Bast's Blend. {{asin|B009E2YUJM}}. Chapter 1 - Does Society 'Dream' Youth Trends?&lt;/ref&gt;
The hypothesis was published in 1997 in the journal ''Towards 2012''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spence |first=Iain |date=1997 |title=The Sekhmet Hypothesis |url=http://dreamflesh.com/projects/towards-2012/ |journal=Towards 2012 (Part 3 Culture and Language) |publisher=Unlimited Dream Company/Slab-O-Concrete |isbn=189986606X|accessdate= March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and covered in 1999, in ''[[Sleazenation]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beale |first=Steve |date=1999 |title=1999 |journal=Sleazenation |publisher=Swinstead | issn= 1742-5506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FrenchHippie.jpg|thumb|right|French [[hippie]] - the hypothesis suggests that atavistic youth trends can be viewed as recurring archetypal symbols.]]

==Origins of the hypothesis==
The origins of the hypothesis can be traced back to [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s book, ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'', in which Wilson makes a singular correlation between the symbol of the flower child with the mood of friendly weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Wilson | first1 = Robert Anton| title = Prometheus Rising| publisher = Falcon Press| page = 55| date = 1983| isbn = 9781561840564}} 'She/He is self-critical, shy, timid, easily led, "spineless," and always looking for somebody to Take Charge and Give Orders. The unearthly Angel, or in modern symbolism, the Flower Child'.&lt;/ref&gt; Spence extended the comment into a study of various youth archetypes and linked in their behaviour to the four [[atavistic]] life scripts. 

The life scripts relate to each other with the following dialogue:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Wilson | first1 = Robert Anton| title = Prometheus Rising| pages = 50 to 59|publisher = Falcon Press| date = 1983| isbn =9781561840564}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Friendly Weakness - I'm not okay, you're okay

Hostile Weakness - I'm not okay, you're not okay

Friendly Strength - I'm okay, you're okay

Hostile Strength - I'm okay, you're not okay&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A diversified and holistic guide to the four life scripts was first introduced by Dr. [[Timothy Leary]] and three of his colleagues in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Leary|first1 = Timothy|last2 = Freeman|first2 = Mervin|last3 = Ossorio|first3 = Abel|last4 = Coffey|first4 = Hubert |title = The Interpersonal Dimension of Personality| publisher = [[Journal of Personality]], Volume 20, Number 2| pages = 143–161| date = 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Leary suggested there were balanced, healthy forms of behaviour in relation to each of the life scripts and extreme, unhealthy forms of behaviour in relation to each of the scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Leary | first1 = Timothy| title = Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality: A Functional Theory and Methodology for Personality Evaluation| publisher = The Ronald Press Company| date = 1957| isbn = 9781592447763}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Wilson | first1 = Robert Anton| title = Prometheus Rising| publisher = Falcon Press| page = 52| date = 1983| isbn = 9781561840564}} 'For instance, a widely used psychological test in this country the Leary Interpersonal Analysis Grid (1957) divides the four quadrants into sixteen sub-quadrants and allows one to grade each in terms of moderate-to-excessive tendency to behave that way.'&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s psychologists such as [[Eric Berne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Berne | first1 = Eric| title = What Do You Say After You Say Hello?| publisher = Corgi| date = 1975| isbn =978-0552098069}} Chapters 3 and 11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Anthony Harris|Thomas Harris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Harris | first1 = Thomas| title = [[I'm OK – You're OK]]| publisher = Pan Books| page = 36 to 51| date = 1973| isbn = 0 330 23543 5 |authorlink= Thomas Anthony Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Claude Steiner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Steiner | first1 = Claude| title = Scripts People Live:Transactional Analysis of Life Scripts| publisher = Grove Press| date = 1990| isbn =978-0802132109}} Chapters 6 to 12.&lt;/ref&gt; had changed Leary's holistic guide to one which favoured Friendly Strength over all the other scripts.

==Influence on comic book mythology==
The author [[Grant Morrison]] later incorporated the idea into his ''[[Invisibles]]'' comic book series (1994–2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Morrison | first1 = Grant| title = The Invisibles, Volume 7, The Invisible Kingdom| publisher = Vertigo| pages = 31, 34, 192| date = 2002| isbn = 1-4012-0019-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[New X-Men]]'' comic book series (2001–2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Morrison | first1 = Grant| title = New X-Men: E is for Extinction| publisher = Marvel| page = 7| date = 2001| isbn =0-7851-0811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Morrison | first1 = Grant| title = New X-Men: Imperial| publisher = Marvel| page = 6| date = 2002| isbn = 0-7851-0887-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = New X-Men#114 Annotations| publisher = Deep Space Transmissions| url = https://sites.google.com/site/deepspacetransmissions/annotations/new-x-men/New-X-Men-114-annotations| accessdate = March 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = New X-Men#118 Annotations| publisher = Deep Space Transmissions| url = https://sites.google.com/site/deepspacetransmissions/annotations/new-x-men/new-x-men-118-annotations| accessdate = March 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison has discussed his own views on the hypothesis in his book, ''[[Supergods]]'' (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Morrison | first1 = Grant| title = Supergods - Our World in the Age of the Superhero| publisher = Random House| pages = 301 to 307| date = 2011| isbn = 9781400069125}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the topic as an influence on his ''[[X-Men]]'' graphic novel, ''[[Riot at Xavier's]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Morrison | first1 = Grant| title = Supergods - Our World in the Age of the Superhero| publisher = Random House| page = 357| date = 2011| isbn = 9781400069125}} "It was the darkside of Spence's imperial youth Stormer generation..."&lt;/ref&gt; The story's lead character, [[Kid Omega]], develops hostile strength tendencies which run out of control with dire consequences for his school.

[[Robert Salkowitz]] discusses the Sekhmet hypothesis in ''[[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] and the Business of Pop Culture'', in which he questions Morrison's take on the hypothesis suggesting instead that the [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]] may explain deeper moods within pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Salkowitz | first1 = Robert| title = Comic-Con and the Business of Pop Culture| publisher = McGraw Hill| pages = 72 to 73| date = 2012| isbn = 978-0071797023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The four life scripts in relation to atavistic youth trends==
[[File:Crass_steve_1981.jpg|thumb|right|Bilious body language: [[Crass]] punk culture, early 1980s.]]
[[Image:KellsFol027v4Evang.jpg|thumb|left|A typical early example of an atavistic quaternity, from The Book of Kells.]]
The hypothesis suggests that the [[flower children]] of the sixties and the mellow side of [[reggae]] culture presents a collective mood of "friendly weakness" while [[punk subculture|punk]] culture and certain aspects of [[rap]] culture present an archetype of 'hostile weakness'. In the late eighties and nineties, [[rave]] culture along with early [[drum and bass]] supposedly presents a mood based mainly on 'friendly strength'.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Iain (2012). ''The Hare Hypothesis''. Bast's Blend. {{asin|B009E2YUJM}}. Chapter 2 - The Four Life Scripts.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis suggests that most people are not hard wired to any particular life script and likewise young people are generally fluid enough to move between different pop trends with ease and some humour. Grunge for example is viewed as an atavistic hybrid, drawing on elements of both punk and hippie culture.&lt;ref name="hare" /&gt;

The social symbolism of the hypothesis is also compared to the archetypal symbolism of Ezekiel's quaternity in the Christian Bible.&lt;ref name="hare" /&gt; Ezekiel is said to have had a vision of the winged man (angel), the bull, the lion and the eagle. The same quaternity was later incorporated into [[illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]]. Spence has corresponded [[flower power]] and late reggae culture ([[Bob Marley]], [[cannabis]] use, [[dub music|dub]], [[dreadlocks]]) to the gentle angel; the rebellious mood of early rap and punk culture to the sullen bull and the leonine strength of drum and bass and rave culture to the proud lion.&lt;ref name="hare"&gt;Spence, Iain (2012). ''The Hare Hypothesis''. Bast's Blend. {{asin|B009E2YUJM}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant Morrison and Iain Spence have split views on the subject of hostile strength played out through youth culture. Morrison suggests that the trend has come and gone with the film ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999) along with commanding symbolism in the [[nu metal]] scene. Spence meanwhile suggests that the mood is yet to materialise within pop culture as a major trend but acknowledges that hostile strength symbolism has already emerged through the more commanding aspects of [[hip hop]], [[gabber]] and [[heavy metal music|metal]] sub-cultures. He has criticised Morrison's reference to ''The Matrix'' in relation to the hypothesis suggesting the film is not related to any specific youth trend.&lt;ref name="hare" /&gt; Morrison already has a link to the film having influenced the story with his mythology of ''The Invisibles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Shapira | first1 = Tom| title = Curing the Postmodern Blues: Reading Grant Morrison and Chris Weston's The Filth in the 21st Century | publisher = Sequart Research &amp; Literacy Organization| page = 84| date = 2013| isbn = 978-0578060767 |chapter=What is The Matrix? |quote="It's also an homage (or a rip off) of much of the content of The Invisibles."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Grant Morrison - Talking with Gods| publisher = Halo 8| date = 2010| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKb5jTSBVtU| accessdate = August 17, 2015}} "I think The Matrix owes Grant Morrison everything..."

==The sequential integration of the life scripts==
[[File:Babymetalfondatheatrelosangeles11.jpg|thumb|left|[[Babymetal]] - playful commanding symbolism within Pop Metal culture.]][[File:Rave_in_Brooklyn.jpg|thumb|right|Ravers 2010 - wearing children's "kandy" beads, along with teething symbolism.]]The hypothesis suggests that teenagers recapitulate infancy and childhood through pop culture. This self-referencing process supposedly leads to the manifestation of social symbols. Spence proposes that the life scripts start in infancy from the state of friendly weakness, an idea already proposed by Thomas Harris in his book, ''I'm OK, You're OK'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Harris | first1 = Thomas| title = I'm Ok - You're Ok| publisher = Pan Books| page = 42| date = 1973| isbn = 0 330 23543 5}} 'I'm not ok - you're ok: this is the universal position of early childhood, being the infant's logical conclusion from the situation from birth and infancy.'&lt;/ref&gt;
Thomas Harris had split from Eric Berne's view that the scripts start from the stage of Friendly Strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Steiner | first1 = Claude| title = Scripts People Live: Transactional Analysis of Life Scripts| publisher = Grove Press| pages = 8–9| date = 1974| isbn = 9780802132109}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some argument as to the sequence and timing of the scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Stewart | first1 = Ian| last2 = Jones | first2 = Vann|title = TA Today – A New Introduction to Transactional Analysis| publisher =  Lifespace Publishing| page = 118| date = 1987| isbn = 1 870244 00 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spence has proposed the life scripts evolve in the sequence of friendly weakness (at birth), hostile weakness (infancy), friendly strength and then lastly the commanding behaviour of hostile strength, some time in late childhood. Unlike Harris and Berne, Spence argues that hostile strength does not have to be "demonised or criminalised" as a mood, claiming that it is only one part of a balanced quaternity of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Iain (2012). ''The Hare Hypothesis''. Bast's Blend. {{asin|B009E2YUJM}}. Chapter 5 - The Sequential Integration of the Four Life Scripts.&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect he has returned to Leary's view of approaching the life scripts from a holistic perspective. Timothy Leary himself has also commented on the relationship between infancy and atavistic pop trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Leary | first1 = Timothy| title = Chaos and Cyberculture| publisher = Ronin| page = 99| date = 1994| isbn = 9780914171775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers such as [[Jon Savage]] have applied the same view to punk culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Savage | first1 = Jon| title = England's Dreaming, Sex Pistols and Punk Rock| publisher = Faber and Faber| page = 374| date = 1991| isbn = 0 571 16791 8}} 'On the legs were the bondage trousers of claustrophobia and babyish incapacity.'&lt;/ref&gt; Spence also draws on children's fiction to illustrate the "four timeless scripts" referring for example to the four main characters in ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' and the four children in ''[[The Polar Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Iain (2012). ''The Hare Hypothesis''. Bast's Blend. {{asin|B009E2YUJM}}. Chapter 6 - The Four Humours: 'Recently the four life scripts have turned up each Christmas with the popularity of, The Polar Express. Lonely Boy presents the friendly weakness of a melancholic, gentle lamb; Know it All Kid is the angry complainer of hostile weakness; Hero Boy is the helpful, protective friendly strength and Hero Girl is the leading child of hostile strength'.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hare Hypothesis==
By 2000 Spence had rejected any solar links to the hypothesis suggesting it might best be treated as a psychological puzzle or game. He rewrote a web-site version of his ideas as, The Hare Hypothesis in a move to keep the hypothesis playful and devoid of any solar connection.&lt;ref name="hare" /&gt; Grant Morrison revived the original solar link in 2011 in his book ''Supergods'' but didn't offer any scientific evidence in support of his views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = An Evening with Grant Morrison and Gerard Way| publisher = Meltdown Comics| date = September 12, 2011| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCbo_FSJdU| accessdate = March 20, 2014 }} [[Grant Morrison]] interviewed by [[Gerard Way]]: contains discussion on the early Sekhmet hypothesis.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hare Hypothesis received a mixed reception on [[Ted Hope]]'s web-site, Truly Free Film, where it was called, 'a fun piece of pop-cultural analysis'. The book was also criticised for having a 'loose [[Jungian]] nature'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Hare Hypothesis|author = Charles Peirce |publisher = Truly Free Film| date = 2014| url = http://trulyfreefilm.hopeforfilm.com/2014/03/nobody-knows-anything-10-the-hare-hypothesis.html| accessdate = July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Time for Citizenship''' is a free website, initiated in 1999 by [[Primary education|Primary schools]] in the UK and Ireland. Since then, the site has expanded somewhat and now has a membership of over 4,000 schools. Its central tenets are to teach children to learn: 
to respect themselves, to respect others’ values and beliefs, to respect their environment, and to respect the law of the land.

Schools interact and share 'best practice' by submitting outstanding projects and children's Artwork. There are currently 38 projects featured on the site from the UK, France, [[South Africa]], Australia, India, Romania, Poland, Spain, Belarus, Greece, Canada, Lithuania, Ireland, Austria, Latvia and Portugal. The site is supported by the Treasury in the UK, [[HSBC]], [[Microsoft]] and [[CSEF]]. Schools and children receive prizes for their entries. A problem page exists for children to pose problems and be answered by their peers - a fine example of [[Mediation|Peer Mediation]].

The site has been endorsed by many of the UK and Ireland's leading politicians.

'''''Unikkausivut: Sharing Our Stories''''' is a 2011, two-volume DVD boxset, website and educational resource from the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), bringing together films by and about the [[Inuit]] people of [[Canada]]. The collection traces the development of filmmaking in [[Northern Canada]], from the [[ethnographic film]]s by NFB filmmakers in the 1940s, to contemporary work by [[Elisapie Isaac]] and other Inuit filmmakers.&lt;ref name=Dixon&gt;{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Guy|title=Out in the cold: the struggle of Inuit film|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/out-in-the-cold-the-struggle-of-inuit-film/article2287215/|accessdate=2 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the Government of Nunavut and the NFB jointly announced the launch of the DVD and online collection, which will eventually comprise more than 100 NFB films by and about Inuit available in [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuinnaqtun]] and other [[Inuit languages]], as well as English and French. The boxed set is being distributed to over 50 communities across Northern Canada, with Nunavut's Department of Education supplying ''Unikkausivut'' ([[Inuktitut syllabics|ᐅᓂᒃᑲᓯᕗᑦ]] {{IPA-iku|u.nik.ka.u.si.vut||}}) to every school and library in its territory.&lt;ref name=Unikkausivut&gt;{{cite news|title=Inuit films move online and into northern communities|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2011/11/02/nfb-inuit-film-project.html|accessdate=5 November 2011|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nunatsiaq&gt;{{cite news|title=New NFB collection includes 24 films on or by Inuit|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674new_nfb_collection_includes_24_films_on_or_by_inuit/|accessdate=7 November 2011|newspaper=[[Nunatsiaq News]]|date=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Echo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nunavutecho.ca/en/featured-articles/item/4801-gn-and-nfb-launch-unikkausivut-sharing-our-stories-film-collection | title=GN and NFB launch Unikkausivut: Sharing our Stories film collection | work=Nunavut Echo | date=1 February 2012 | agency=Government of Nunavut News | accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film collection premiered in Ottawa on November 2, 2011, as part of the 40th anniversary celebrations of the [[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami]], followed by community events across Inuit territories (Inuit Nunangat) in [[Iqaluit]], Nunavut on November 7; [[Kuujjuaq]], [[Nunavik]] on November 8; [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]], [[Nunatsiavut]] on November 17; and [[Inuvik]] in the [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]] of the [[Northwest Territories]] on November 23.&lt;ref name=NFBpr&gt;{{cite web|title=NFB AND INUIT PARTNERS LAUNCH UNIKKAUSIVUT: SHARING OUR STORIES|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/medias/download/documents/pdf/Release_Unikkausivut.pdf|work=Press release|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lampe&gt;{{cite news|title=23 November 2011|accessdate=2 January 2012|url=http://www.cbc.ca/wam/episodes/2011/11/23/wam-november-19-20-unikkausivut/|newspaper=Weekend Arts Magazine|agency=[[CBC Radio]]|format=Audio interview with Johannes Lampe, Minister of Culture, Recreation and Tourism, Nunatsiavut Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the collection was expanded with six films from Nunatsiavut, to mark the 10th anniversary of the Labrador Inuit Lands Claims Agreement. In 2016, the NFB launched a new educational initiative based on ''Unikkausivut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2016/09/19/national-film-board-shares-its-treasure-trove-of-inuit-stories/|title=National Film Board shares its treasure trove of Inuit stories|last=Sevunts|first=Levon|date=19 September 2016|work=[[Radio Canada International]]|access-date=27 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception==
''Unikkausivut'' was partly inspired by the then-federal [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Minister of Health]] [[Leona Aglukkaq]]. An Inuk from the [[Inuvik Region]], Aglukkaq had enjoyed watching the NFB’s ''[[Netsilik Inuit|Netsilik Eskimos]]'' series in her youth and felt that it would be worthwhile to make these older films about Northern Canada widely available. The NFB, which was already working to make its archival films available on new platforms, reviewed its Inuit film archives and determined that it had over 100 works worth rereleasing.&lt;ref name=Lougheed&gt;{{cite news|last=Lougheed|first=Tim|title=Restoring Cultural Treasures: NFB Project Resurrects Inuit Film Archive|url=http://www.arcticjournal.ca/index.php/2011/07/restoring-cultural-treasures/|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=[[Above&amp;Beyond (magazine)|Above&amp;Beyond]]|date=July–August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
It cost over $1 million and took two years for the NFB to get the first 24 films digitized and ready in all languages; getting all of the films translated for northern communities could cost an additional $2 million.&lt;ref name=Unikkausivut/&gt; This work involves restoring original film prints where necessary, digitization, remixing sound and obtaining rights clearances for new digital formats. Each film must also be dubbed in Inuktitut, the language of one of Canada's four Inuit regions—a challenge in itself, since Inuktitut narrations often run longer than their French or English equivalents. The conversion of all these films is expected to be completed by 2015.&lt;ref name=Lougheed/&gt;
 
''Unikkausivut: Sharing Our Stories'' was created by the NFB in collaboration with the Inuit Relations Secretariat of [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]] and the Government of Nunavut's Department of Education.&lt;ref name=theproject&gt;{{cite web|title=The Project|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/unikkausivut/?lg=eng|work=National Film Board of Canada website|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advisory committee included Inuit elders such as [[Peter Irniq]].&lt;ref name=Unikkausivut/&gt;&lt;ref name=Collaborators&gt;{{cite web|title=Collaborators|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/unikkausivut/collaborators.php|work=National Film Board of Canada website|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9318">'''University Mobility in Asia and the Pacific''' ('''UMAP''') is a voluntary regional association of government, non-government and/or university representatives of the [[higher education]] sector established in 1993 to enhance cooperation and exchange of people and expertise through increased mobility of higher education students and staff.&lt;ref name="UMAP About"&gt;[http://www.umap.org/2009/en/about/index.php UMAP About].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UMAP Governance"&gt;[http://www.umap.org/2009/en/govermance/ UMAP Governance].&lt;/ref&gt; UMAP has been endorsed by [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]]&lt;ref&gt;https://internationaleducation.gov.au/About-AEI/Government-Relations/Pages/TheEducationNetwork.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://umap.org/is/4804/&lt;/ref&gt; and member countries are implementing UMAP projects.&lt;ref name="UMAP Brief History"&gt;[http://www.umap.org/2009/en/about/index-more3.php UMAP Brief History].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apec.org/Meeting-Papers/Sectoral-Ministerial-Meetings/Education/2004_education/annex_a&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1991 the movement of '''University Mobility in Asia and the Pacific''' ('''UMAP''') was initiated when [[Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee]] proposed and sponsored two conferences to promote the discussion on educational cooperation in [[Asia and the Pacific]], inviting representatives of institutes of [[higher education]] from [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Korea]].&lt;ref name="UMAP Brief History" /&gt; The first meeting was held in April 1991 in [[Hong Kong]] and the second meeting was held in September 1991 in [[Canberra]]. During the second meeting, representatives of 18 countries and territories in the region agreed to establish themselves as a ''Reference Group'', and this was termed the ''First Reference Group Meeting''. Additional annual meetings were held between 1992 and 1996, at [[Seoul]], [[Taipei]], [[Osaka]] and [[Auckland]].&lt;ref name="UMAP Brief History" /&gt; In the fourth meeting, participants called on Member governments to set up a central scholarship fund to encourage mobility in the region and [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] started publicly supporting UMAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Issues Surrounding Mobility with Particular Reference to Japan | author = Yu Kameoka | pages =243–249 |date=June 1996 | journal = European Journal of Education | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | issn = 0141-8211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last meeting held in 1996, the location of ''UMAP International Secretariat'' was discussed and decided to establish in [[Japan]]. In 2011,  the new location for the International Secretariat was changed to [[Fu Jen Catholic University]] in Taiwan.

===Aims===
"''UMAP aims to achieve enhanced international understanding through increased mobility of university students and staff''".&lt;ref name="UMAP About" /&gt;

==UMAP Members==
Membership is open to countries/territories in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. Members can be represented by government, department or minister of education, individual university or university umbrella organization. However, individual persons are not eligible to become members.&lt;ref name="UMAP Members"&gt;[http://www.umap.org/2009/en/member/index.php UMAP Members].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.umap.org/2009/en/member/ Eligible Countries / Territories]
* [http://www.umap.org/2009/en/member/fullmember.php Full Member Countries / Territories]
* [http://www.umap.org/2009/en/cms/index.php?gid=8 UMAP participating Universities]

==Governance and Budget==
The governing authority is UMAP Board. The board is composed by representatives from each of UMAP Full Members. Each of the Full Members has a voting right, however Secretary General of the Board cannot vote.&lt;ref name="Governance and Funding"&gt;[http://www.umap.org/2009/en/govermance/ Governance and Funding].&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual budget is prepared in US dollars and UMAP Members need to make a contribution according to the budget. Members can make additional voluntary contribution. These contributions can be funding, facilities or resources.&lt;ref name="Governance and Funding" /&gt;

==Exchange==
UMAP exchange program is a two-way [[student exchange]] and it is for [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] students in all disciplines to undertake a minimum of one semester or maximum of two semesters towards their degree in universities overseas, with [[transfer credit|credit transfer]] managed by UMAP and cooperating institutions.&lt;ref name="UMAP About" /&gt;

===Home Universities Responsibilities===
* Selection of students and staff
* Approval of study program, including any necessary language training
* Determine and allocate financial support to participating students and staff
* Provide preparatory courses prior to the departure
* Recognize work completed overseas for credit towards their degree &lt;ref name="Universities Responsibilities"&gt;[http://www.umap.org/2009/en/about/index-more.php Universities Responsibilities].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Host Universities Responsibilities===
* Waive tuition fees to participating student and staff
* Provide the approved and agreed study program
* Evaluate the performance of participants and report to Home Universities
* Provide appropriate counseling and support services
* Assist students and staff with accommodation
* Ensure that appropriate health cover is arranged &lt;ref name="Universities Responsibilities" /&gt;

===Exchange Agreements and Funding===
UMAP does not offer individual exchanges, however UMAP countries/territories fund national UMAP programs. Under the agreement between countries/territories, students’ fees are waived and [[transfer credit|credit transfer]] will be made under UMAP credit transfer program. Exchange funding agreements are between the host and home universities. Institution-to-institution agreements covers the maintenance of scholarship benefits, eligibility for government funding assistance and health cover costs.&lt;ref name="Exchange funding"&gt;[http://www.usumap.org/ucts_brochure.pdf UMAP Exchange Funding].&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Australian universities]] receive A$5,000 per student that applies to UMAP exchange program in order to subsidise the cost of the student’s participation. In addition, universities that receive funding are required to complete a report in order to receive funding from their government. This will vary depending on the agreement between home and host universities, countries/territories.&lt;ref name="UMAP Exchange example"&gt;[http://www.deewr.gov.au/International/EndeavourAwards/InternationalStudentExchangePrograms/Pages/UMAPExchangeProgram.aspx UMAP Exchange Funding in Australia].&lt;/ref&gt;

==UMAP Credit Transfer Scheme (UCTS)==
UMAP has developed a pilot '''[[UMAP Credit Transfer Scheme]]''' ('''UCTS''') to facilitate greater student mobility in the region by providing a framework for establishing credit transfer arrangements.&lt;ref name ="UMAP Credit Transfer Scheme"&gt;[http://www.umap.org/2009/en/cms/detail.php?id=6 UMAP Credit Transfer Scheme].&lt;/ref&gt; The UCTS objective is to ensure effective [[transfer credit|credit transfer]] for students undertaking [[exchange program]] in universities from UMAP countries/territories.&lt;ref name ="More about UTCS"&gt;[http://www.umap.org/2009/en/cms/detail.php?id=133 More about UCTS].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarships==
During 2002-2005 UMAP provided [[scholarships]] for student in members’ countries/territories universities. However, the program is temporarily closed until further notice.&lt;ref name="UMAP Scholarships"&gt;[http://www.umap.org/2009/en/scholarship/scholarship0205.php UMAP Scholarships].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobility Programs==
* [http://www.umap.org/2009/en/cms/detail.php?id=127 Student Connection Online]
* [http://www.umap.org/2009/en/cms/detail.php?id=137 Language and Culture Program]

* [http://www.umap.org/2009/en/cms/detail.php?id=29 Alumni Forum]

==Similar program==
The [[Erasmus Programme]] (European Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students) is a European Union student exchange program.&lt;ref name="Erasmus Programme"&gt;[[Erasmus Programme]].&lt;/ref&gt; UMAP and the [[Erasmus Programme]] are regional associations and similarities can be found between these two programs, especially in the [[transfer credit|credit transfer]] and tuition fee waiver scheme where UMAP adopted a similar approach  to facilitate student mobility.

There are some differences between these programs.&lt;ref name="UMAP About" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Erasmus Programme" /&gt;
