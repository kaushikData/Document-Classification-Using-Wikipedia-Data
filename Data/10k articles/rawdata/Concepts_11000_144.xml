      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8362">In mathematics, an '''abstract cell complex''' is an abstract set with [[Alexandrov topology]] in which a non-negative integer number called [[dimension]] is assigned to each point. The complex is called “abstract” since its points, which are called “cells”, are not subsets of a [[Hausdorff space]] as it is the case in Euclidean and [[CW complex]]. Abstract cell complexes play an important role in [[image analysis]] and [[computer graphics]].

==History==
The idea of abstract cell complexes &lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Klette: Cell complexes through time. http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.404813&lt;/ref&gt; (also named abstract cellular complexes) relates to [[Johann Benedict Listing|J. Listing]] (1862) &lt;ref&gt;Listing J.: "Der Census räumlicher Complexe". ''Abhandlungen der Königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen'', v. 10, Göttingen, 1862, 97–182.&lt;/ref&gt; und [[Ernst Steinitz|E. Steinitz]] (1908).&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz E.: "Beiträge zur Analysis". ''Sitzungsbericht Berliner Mathematischen Gesellschaft'', Band. 7, 1908, 29–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Also A.W Tucker (1933),&lt;ref&gt;Tucker A.W.: "An abstract approach to manifolds", Annals Mathematics, v. 34, 1933, 191-243.&lt;/ref&gt; K. Reidemeister (1938),&lt;ref&gt;Reidemeister K.: "Topologie der Polyeder und kombinatorische Topologie der Komplexe". Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft Geest &amp; Portig, Leipzig, 1938 (second edition 1953)&lt;/ref&gt; P.S. Aleksandrov (1956) &lt;ref&gt;Aleksandrov P.S.: Combinatorial Topology, Graylock Press, Rochester, 1956,&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as R. Klette und A. Rosenfeld (2004) &lt;ref&gt;Klette R. und Rosenfeld. A.: "Digital Geometry", Elsevier, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; have described abstract cell complexes. E. Steinitz has defined an abstract cell complex as &lt;math&gt; C=(E,B,dim)&lt;/math&gt; where ''E'' is an '''abstract''' set, ''B'' is an asymmetric, irreflexive and transitive binary relation called the '''bounding relation''' among the elements of ''E'' and ''dim'' is a function assigning a non-negative integer to each element of ''E'' in such a way that if &lt;math&gt;B(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;dim(a)&lt;dim(b)&lt;/math&gt;. 
V. Kovalevsky (1989) &lt;ref&gt;Kovalevsky, V.: "Finite Topology as Applied to Image Analysis", ''Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing'', v. 45, No. 2, 1989, 141–161.&lt;/ref&gt; described abstract cell complexes for 3D and higher dimensions. He also suggested numerous applications to image analysis. In his book (2008) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.geometry.kovalevsky.de.&lt;/ref&gt; he has suggested an axiomatic theory of locally finite [[topological spaces]] which are generalization of abstract cell complexes. The book contains among others new definitions of topological balls and spheres independent of [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], a new definition of [[combinatorial manifold]]s and many algorithms useful for image analysis.

==Basic results==
The topology of abstract cell complexes is based on a [[partial order]] in the set of its points or cells. 

The notion of the abstract cell complex defined by E. Steinitz is related to the notion of an [[abstract simplicial complex]] and it differs from a [[simplicial complex]] by the property that its elements are no [[simplex|simplices]]: An ''n''-dimensional element of an abstract complexes must not have ''n''+1 zero-dimensional sides, and not each subset of the set of zero-dimensional sides of a cell is a cell. This is important since the notion of an abstract cell complexes can be applied to the two- and three-dimensional grids used in image processing, which is not true for simplicial complexes. A non-simplicial complex is a generalization which makes the introduction of cell coordinates possible: There are non-simplicial complexes which are Cartesian products of such "linear" one-dimensional complexes where each zero-dimensional cell, besides two of them, bounds exactly two one-dimensional cells. Only such Cartesian complexes make it possible to introduce such coordinates that each cell has a set of coordinates and any two different cells have different coordinate sets. The coordinate set can serve as a name of each cell of the complex which is important for processing complexes. 

Abstract complexes allow the introduction of classical topology (Alexandrov-topology) in grids being the basis of digital image processing. This possibility defines the great advantage of abstract cell complexes: It becomes possible to exactly define the notions of connectivity and of the boundary of subsets. The definition of dimension of cells and of complexes is in the general case different from that of simplicial complexes (see below).

The notion of an abstract cell complex differs essentially from that of a CW-complex because an abstract cell complex is no [[Hausdorff space]]. This is important from the point of view of computer science since it is impossible to explicitly represent a non-discrete Hausdorff space in a computer. (The neighborhood of each point in such a space must have infinitely many points). 

The book by V. Kovalevsky &lt;ref&gt;V. Kovalevsky: "Geometry of Locally Finite Spaces". Editing house Dr. Bärbel Kovalevski, Berlin 2008. {{ISBN|978-3-9812252-0-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; contains the description of the theory of [[locally finite space]]s which are a generalization of abstract cell complexes. A locally finite space ''S'' is a set of points where a subset of ''S'' is defined for each point ''P'' of ''S''. This subset containing a limited number of points is called the '''smallest neighborhood''' of ''P''. A binary neighborhood relation is defined in the set of points of the locally finite space ''S'': The element (point) ''b'' is in the neighborhood relation with the element ''a'' if ''b'' belongs to the smallest neighborhood of the element ''a''. New axioms of a locally finite space have been formulated, and it was proven that the space ''S'' is in accordance with the axioms only if the neighborhood relation is anti-symmetric and transitive. The neighborhood relation is the reflexive hull of the inverse bounding relation. It was shown that classical axioms of the topology can be deduced as theorems from the new axioms. Therefore, a locally finite space satisfying the new axioms is a particular case of a classical topological space. Its topology is a [[poset topology]] or [[Alexandrov topology]].
An abstract cell complex is a particular case of a locally finite space in which the dimension is defined for each point. It was demonstrated that the dimension of a cell ''c'' of an abstract cell complex is equal to the length (number of cells minus 1) of the maximum bounding path leading from any cell of the complex to the cell ''c''. The bounding path is a sequence of cells in which each cell bounds the next one. The book contains the theory of digital straight segments in 2D complexes, numerous algorithms for tracing boundaries in 2D and 3D, for economically encoding the boundaries and for exactly reconstructing a subset from the code of its boundary.

==Abstract Cell Complex Digital Image Representation==
[[File:Digital Image ACC Decomposition.PNG|thumb|A 3x4 digital image decomposed into its Abstract Cell Complex dimensional constituents.]]
A digital image may be represented by a 2D Abstract Cell Complex (ACC) by decomposing the image into its ACC dimensional constituents: points (0-cell), cracks/edges (1-cell), and pixels/faces (2-cell).

[[File:Digital Image ACC Coordinate Assignment.PNG|thumb|Digital Image ACC Coordinate Assignment]]
This decomposition together with a coordinate assignment rule to unambiguously assign coordinates from the image pixels to the dimensional constituents permit certain image analysis operations to be carried out on the image with elegant algorithms such as crack [[boundary tracing]], [[digital straight segment]] subdivision, etc. One such rule maps the points, cracks, and faces to the top left coordinate of the pixel. It should be noted that these dimensional constituents require no explicit translation into their own data structures but may be implicitly understood and related to the 2D array which is the usual data structure representation of a digital image. This coordinate assignment rule and the renderings of each cell incident to this image is depicted in the image at right.

The '''Barnum effect''', also called the '''Forer effect''', is a common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them, that are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Barnum-Effect|title=Barnum Effect {{!}} psychology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some paranormal beliefs and practices, such as [[astrology]], [[fortune telling]], [[Aura (paranormal)|aura reading]], and some types of [[personality test]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seeking Alpha"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Barnum Effect|url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4095081-barnum-effect|website=Seeking Alpha|publisher=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These characterizations are often used by practitioners as a con-technique to convince victims that they are endowed with a paranormal gift. Because the assessment statements are so vague, people interpret their own meaning, thus the statement becomes "personal" to them. Also, individuals are more likely to accept negative assessments of themselves if they perceive the person presenting the assessment as a high-status professional.

The term "Barnum effect" was coined in 1956 by psychologist [[Paul Meehl]] in his essay ''Wanted – A Good Cookbook.''

==Overview==
The Barnum effect is manifested in response to statements that are called "Barnum statements", meaning general characterisations attributed to an individual are perceived to be true of them, even though the statements are such generalizations, they could apply to almost anyone. Such techniques are used by fortune tellers, astrologers, and other practitioners of chicanery to convince paying customers that they, the practitioners, are in fact endowed with a paranormal gift.&lt;ref name="The Skeptic's Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert|title=Barnum effect|url=http://skepdic.com/barnum.html|website=The Skeptic's Dictionary|publisher=The Skeptic's Dictionary|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is a specific example of the so-called "acceptance phenomenon", which describes the general tendency of humans "to accept almost any bogus personality feedback".&lt;ref name="Journal of Personality Assessment"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tobacyk|first1=Jerome|last2=Milford|first2=Gary|last3=Springer|first3=Thomas|last4=Tobacyk|first4=Zofia|title=Paranormal Beliefs and the Barnum Effect|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|date=June 10, 2010|pages=737–739|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327752jpa5204_13|accessdate=28 February 2017|doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa5204_13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related and more general phenomenon is that of [[subjective validation]].&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=David F. |authorlink=David Marks (psychologist) |title=The Psychology of the Psychic |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York |date=2000 |edition=2 |pages=41 |isbn=1-57392-798-8|title-link=The Psychology of the Psychic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective validation occurs when two unrelated or even random events are perceived to be related because a belief, expectation, or hypothesis demands a relationship. For example, while reading a [[horoscope]], people actively seek a correspondence between its contents and their perception of their personality.

==Early research==

In 1947, a psychologist named Ross Stagner asked a number of personnel managers to take a personality test. After they had taken the test, Stagner, instead of responding with feedback based on their actual individual answers, presented each of them with generalized feedback that had no relation to their test answers but that was, instead, based on [[horoscope]]s, [[Graphology|graphological]] analyses, and the like. Each of the managers was then asked how accurate the assessment of him or her was. More than half described the assessment as accurate, and almost none described it as wrong.&lt;ref name="Psychology Today"&gt;{{cite web|author=Adrian Furnham|title=We've Got Something for Everyone: The Barnum Effect|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sideways-view/201411/weve-got-something-everyone-the-barnum-effect|publisher=Psychology Today|date=21 November 2014|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stagner|first=Ross|date=1958-09-01|title=The Gullibility of Personnel Managers|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1958.tb00022.x/abstract|journal=Personnel Psychology|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=347–352|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1958.tb00022.x|issn=1744-6570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, in what has been described as a "classic experiment",&lt;ref name="Denis Dutton"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dutton|first1=Denis|title=The Cold Reading Technique|url=http://www.denisdutton.com/cold_reading.htm|website=Denis Dutton|publisher=Denis Dutton|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychologist]] [[Bertram Forer|Bertram R. Forer]] gave a psychology test—his so-called "Diagnostic Interest Blank"—to 39 of his psychology students who were told that they would each receive a brief personality [[Vignette (psychology)|vignette]] or sketch based on their test results. One week later Forer gave each student a purportedly individualized sketch and asked each of them to rate it on how well it applied. In reality, each student received the same sketch, consisting of the following items:&lt;ref name="Forer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forer |first=B.R. |authorlink=Bertram Forer |date=1949 |title=The fallacy of personal validation: A classroom demonstration of gullibility |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=118–123 |doi=10.1037/h0059240 |url=http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/Forer_The%20fallacy%20of%20personal%20validation_1949.pdf |PMID=18110193 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305220420/http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/Forer_The%20fallacy%20of%20personal%20validation_1949.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# You have a great need for other people to like and admire you.
# You have a tendency to be critical of yourself.

# While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them.
# Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside.

On average, the students rated its accuracy as 4.30 on a scale of 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent). Only after the ratings were turned in was it revealed that each student had received an identical sketch assembled by Forer from a newsstand astrology book.&lt;ref name="Forer" /&gt; The sketch contains statements that are vague and general enough to apply to most people.

The Forer effect is also known as the "Barnum effect", a term coined in 1956 by American psychologist [[Paul Meehl]] in his essay "Wanted—A Good Cookbook", because he relates the vague personality descriptions used in certain "pseudo-successful" psychological tests to those given by showman [[P. T. Barnum]].&lt;ref name=Meehl1956&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meehl |first1=Paul E. |title=Wanted&amp;mdash;A Good Cookbook |journal=American Psychologist |date=1956 |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=263–272 |doi=10.1037/h0044164 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0044164 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717234755/http://data.psych.udel.edu/abelcher/Shared%20Documents/1%20Assessment%20%2848%29/d%20Clinical%20decision-making/Meehl%201956.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutton1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutton|first1=D. L.|title=The cold reading technique|journal=Experientia|date=1988|volume=44|issue=4|pages=326–332|doi=10.1007/BF01961271|url=http://denisdutton.com/cold_reading.htm|language=en|pmid=3360083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forer attributed the effect to [[gullibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/barnum_demo.htm|title=The Barnum Demonstration|website=psych.fullerton.edu|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect has been said to confirm the so-called "[[Pollyanna principle]]", which states that individuals tend "to use or accept positive words of feedback more frequently than negative words of feedback".&lt;ref name="Psychology Today"/&gt;

== Repeating the study ==
Two factors are important in producing the Forer effect, according to the findings of replication studies. The content of the description offered is important, with specific emphasis on the ratio of positive to negative trait assessments. The other important factor is that the subject trusts the honesty of the person providing feedback.&lt;ref name="Claridge 2008 436–444"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Claridge|first=G|author2=Clark, K. |author3=Powney, E. |author4=Hassan, E. |title=Schizotypy and the Barnum effect|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2008|volume=44|issue=2|pages=436–444 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2012|first=Brett |last=Rutledge|title=Something for Everyone – The Barnum Effect|url=http://thearticulateceo.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/01/something-for-everyone-the-barnum-effect.html|publisher=The Articulate CEO|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was repeated again in 2011 with the statements altered so that they applied to organizations rather than individuals. The results were similar, suggesting that people anthropomorphize organizations and are gullible when interpreting their characters.&lt;ref name="Nolan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nolan|first=Stuart|title=Gullibility or Vulnerability?|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxSalford-Stuart-Nolan-The-Fo;search%3Astuart%20nolan|work=[[TEDx]]Salford|date=2012|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect is consistently found when the assessment statements are vague. People are able to read their own meaning into the statements they receive, and thus the statement becomes "personal" to them. The most effective statements include the phrase "at times", such as "At times you feel very sure of yourself, while at other times you are not as confident." This phrase can apply to almost anyone, and thus each person can read a "personal" meaning into it. Keeping statements vague in this manner ensures observing the Forer effect in replication studies.&lt;ref name="Krauss-Whitbourne"&gt;{{cite web|last=Krauss-Whitbourne|first=Susan|title=When it comes to personality tests, skepticism is a good thing.|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201008/when-it-comes-personality-tests-dose-skepticism-is-good-thing|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals are more likely to accept negative assessments of themselves if they perceive the persons presenting them with those assessments as high-status professionals. Evidence also suggests that people with authoritarian or neurotic personalities or who have a greater than usual need for approval are more likely to manifest the Barnum effect.&lt;ref name="Psychology Today"/&gt;

== Variables influencing the effect ==
Studies suggest that the Forer effect is universal—it has been observed in people from many cultures and locations. In 2009, psychologists Paul Rogers and Janice Soule conducted a study that compared the tendencies of Westerners to accept Barnum personality profiles to the tendencies of Chinese people. They were unable to find any significant differences.&lt;ref name=Rogers2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Paul|last2=Soule|first2=Janice|title=Cross-Cultural Differences in the Acceptance of Barnum Profiles Supposedly Derived From Western Versus Chinese Astrology|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|date=2009|volume=40|issue=3|pages=381–399|doi=10.1177/0022022109332843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later studies have found that subjects give higher accuracy ratings if the following are true:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dickson |first=D.H. |last2=Kelly|first2= I.W. |date=1985 |title=The 'Barnum Effect' in Personality Assessment: A Review of the Literature |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=367–382 |publisher=Missoula |doi=10.2466/pr0.1985.57.2.367}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the subject believes that the analysis applies only to him or her, and thus applies his or her own meaning to the statements.&lt;ref name="Krauss-Whitbourne" /&gt;
* the subject believes in the authority of the evaluator.
* the analysis lists mainly positive traits.

The method in which the Barnum personality profiles are presented can affect the extent to which people accept them as their own. For instance, Barnum profiles that are more personalized—perhaps containing a specific person's name—are more likely to yield higher acceptability ratings than those that could be applied to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farley-Icard|first=Roberta Lynn|title=Factors that influence the Barnum Effect: Social desirability, base rates and personalization|date=2007|accessdate=2012-11-11|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/14/44/1444101.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent research ==

=== Belief in the paranormal ===

Subjects who, for example, believe in the accuracy of horoscopes have a greater tendency to believe that the vague generalities of the response apply specifically to them. Studies on the relationship between mild symptoms of schizophrenia and susceptibility to the Forer effect have shown high amounts of correlation.&lt;ref name="Claridge 2008 436–444" /&gt; However, Rogers and Soule's 2009 study (see "Variables influencing the effect" above) also tested subjects' astrological beliefs. Both the Chinese and Western skeptics were more likely to identify the ambiguity in the Barnum profiles.

=== Self-serving bias ===

[[Self-serving bias]] has been shown to cancel the Forer effect. According to the self-serving bias, subjects accept positive attributes about themselves while rejecting negative ones. In one study, subjects were given one of three personality reports: one consisting of Barnum profiles containing socially desirable personality traits, one containing a mixture of positive and negative traits, and the last containing profiles full of negative traits. (also called "common faults")

Subjects who received the socially desirable and mixed reports were far more likely to agree with the personality assessments than the subjects who received negative reports, although there was not a significant difference between the first two groups.

In another study, subjects were given a list of traits instead of the usual "fake" personality assessment. The subjects were asked to rate how much they felt these traits applied to them. In line with the self-serving bias, the majority of subjects agreed with positive traits about themselves and disagreed with negative ones. The study concluded that the self-serving bias is powerful enough to cancel out the usual Forer effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=D.J.|author2=Standing, L.G.|title=Does self-serving bias cancel the Barnum effect?|journal=Social behavior and personality|date=2002|volume=30|issue=6|pages=625–630|doi=10.2224/sbp.2002.30.6.625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relevance of astrological sign information===
In a 1971 experiment by Bernie I. Silverman, subjects were presented with twelve personality sketches drawn from a set of horoscopes and asked to choose the four that best described them. When the descriptions were not identified by astrological sign, subjects were not particularly likely to pick the horoscope for their own sign. When the descriptions were labeled by sign, however, subjects were more likely to pick the horoscope for their own sign.&lt;ref name="Denis Dutton"/&gt;

===Relevance of birth date information===

[[C. R. Snyder]] and R. J. Shenkel carried out a study in which they asked their students to prepare uniform Barnum descriptions for a group of subjects; these descriptions were then presented to study participants under the guise of being individualized horoscopes. Subjects in one group were not asked for personal information; those in a second group were asked to provided their month of birth; those in a third group were asked for the exact date of their birth. Those in the third group were most likely to say that their "horoscopes" applied to them; those in the first group were least likely to do so.&lt;ref name="Denis Dutton"/&gt;

==Exploiting the effect==
{{see also|Cold reading}}
In 1977, Ray Hyman wrote about the way in which palm readers and other such [[huckster]]s exploit the Forer effect to take advantage of victims (or 'marks'). He provided a list of factors that help these tricksters to dupe their prey. For example, hucksters are more likely to be successful if they exude an air of confidence ("If you look and act as if you believe in what you are doing, you will be able to sell even a bad reading to most of your subjects"), if they "[m]ake creative use of the latest statistical abstracts, polls, and surveys" showing "what various subclasses of our society believe, do, want, worry about, and so on", if they employ "a gimmick, such as a crystal ball, tarot cards, or palm reading", if they are alert to the clues provided about their clients by such details as their "clothing, jewelry, mannerisms and speech", if they are not afraid of "hamming it up", and if they use flattery.&lt;ref name="Psychology Today"/&gt;

[[Michael H. Birnbaum|Michael Birnbaum]], a Professor of Psychology at [[California State University, Fullerton]], has noted that the Forer effect is used by [[magician (paranormal)|magician]]s and [[psychic]]s when they give so-called "[[cold reading]]s", as well as by certain TV personalities who claim psychoanalytical expertise and profess to be able to diagnose a guest's psychological problems in a few minutes. "Real psychologists are horrified by this practice", states Birnbaum, but they fail to criticize it vigorously enough in public, and so it continues to be treated with a respect it doesn't deserve.&lt;ref name="California State University, Fullerton"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Barnum Effect|url=http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/barnum_demo.htm|publisher=California State University, Fullerton|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is regrettable that academic psychology has not paid more attention to the cold reading technique," Denis Dutton wrote in 1988, "inasmuch as the widespread practice of successful cold reading forms the basis for much of the belief in paranormal powers to be found in society today." While academic psychologists had focused in their studies on students, Dutton called for "analysis of the actual techniques and methods used by proficient cold readers".&lt;ref name="Denis Dutton"/&gt;

A 2016 article explained to marketers how to use the Forer effect to win customers. The main piece of advice was to employ flattery.&lt;ref name="Jeremy Said"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Jeremy|title=The Forer Effect: A Little Flattery Will Help Your Customers Believe — and Convert|url=https://www.jeremysaid.com/blog/the-forer-effect-how-to-convert-your-customers-with-flattery/|website=Jeremy Said|publisher=Jeremy Said|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The moral of the Barnum Demonstration", Birnbaum has said, is that "Self-validation is no validation. Do not be fooled by a psychic, quack psychotherapist, or a phony faith healer who uses this trick on you! Be skeptical and ask for proof. Keep your money in your wallet, your wallet in your pocket, and your hand on your wallet."&lt;ref name="California State University, Fullerton"/&gt;

* A '''type I''' cluster is dominated by a bright, large, supermassive [[Type-cD galaxy|cD galaxy]]; for example [[Abell 2029]] and [[Abell 2199]].
* A '''type II''' cluster contains [[elliptical galaxies]] whose brightness relative to the cluster is intermediate to that of type I and type III. The [[Coma Cluster]] is an example of a type II.
* A '''type III''' cluster has no remarkable members, such as the [[Virgo Cluster]]. Type-III has two subdivisions, '''type IIIE''' and '''type IIIS'''
** '''Type IIIE''' clusters do not contain many giant spirals
** '''Type IIIS''' clusters contain many giant spirals
* The deprecated '''type IV''' was for clusters whose brightest members were predominantly spirals.&lt;ref name="Bautz-Morgan 1970a"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7243">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''Beck's monadicity theorem''' gives a criterion that characterises [[monadic functor]]s, introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Beck|year=2003|authorlink=Jonathan Mock Beck}} in about 1964. It is often stated in dual form for [[comonad]]s.  It is sometimes called the '''Beck tripleability theorem''' because of the older term ''triple'' for a monad.

Beck's monadicity theorem asserts that a [[functor]]

:&lt;math&gt;U: C \to D&lt;/math&gt;

is monadic if and only if&lt;ref&gt;Pedicchio &amp; Tholen (2004) p.228&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''U'' has a left [[adjoint functors|adjoint]];
# ''U'' reflects [[isomorphism]]s; and
# ''C'' has [[coequalizer]]s of ''U''-split parallel pairs (those parallel pairs of morphisms in ''C'', which ''U'' sends to pairs having a split coequalizer in ''D''), and ''U'' preserves those coequalizers.

There are several variations of Beck's theorem: if ''U'' has a left adjoint then any of the following conditions ensure that ''U'' is monadic:
*''U'' reflects [[isomorphism]]s and ''C'' has [[coequalizer]]s of reflexive pairs (those with a common right inverse)  and ''U'' preserves those coequalizers.  (This gives the crude monadicity theorem.)
*Every fork in ''C'' which is by ''U'' sent to a split coequalizer sequence in ''D'' is itself a coequalizer sequence in ''C''. In different words, ''U'' creates (preserves and reflects) ''U''-split coequalizer sequences.

Another variation of Beck's theorem characterizes strictly monadic functors: those for which the comparison functor is an isomorphism rather than just an equivalence. For this version the definitions of what it means to create coequalizers is changed slightly: the coequalizer has to be unique rather than just unique up to isomorphism.

Beck's theorem is particularly important in its relation with the [[descent (category theory)|descent theory]], which plays role in sheaf and stack theory, as well as in the [[Grothendieck]]'s approach to [[algebraic geometry]]. Most cases of faithfully flat descent of [[algebraic structure]]s (e.g. those in [[Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique|FGA]] and in  [[Grothendieck's Séminaire de géométrie algébrique|SGA1]]) are special cases of Beck's theorem. The theorem gives an exact categorical description of the process of 'descent', at this level. In 1970 the Grothendieck approach via [[fibered category|fibered categories]] and [[descent data]] was shown (by Bénabou and Roubaud) to be equivalent (under some conditions) to the comonad approach. In a later work, [[Pierre Deligne]] applied Beck's theorem to [[Tannakian category]] theory, greatly simplifying the basic developments.

==Examples==

*It follows from Beck's theorem that the forgetful functor from compact Hausdorff spaces to sets is monadic. The left adjoint is the [[Stone–Čech compactification]], the forgetful functor preserves all colimits, and it reflects isomorphisms because any continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism. The forgetful functor from topological spaces to sets is not monadic as it does not reflect isomorphisms.
*The powerset functor from Set&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; to Set is monadic, where Set is the category of sets. More generally Beck's theorem can be used to show that the powerset functor from T&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; to T is monadic for any topos T, which in turn is used to show that the topos T has finite colimits.
*The forgetful functor from semigroups to sets is monadic. This functor does not preserve arbitrary coequalizers, showing that some restriction  on the coequalizers in Beck's theorem is necessary if one wants to have conditions that are necessary and sufficient.
*If ''B'' is a faithfully flat commutative ring over the commutative ring ''A'' then the functor ''T'' from ''A'' modules to ''B'' modules taking ''M'' to ''B''⊗&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' is a comonad. This follows from the dual of Becks theorem, as the condition that ''B'' is flat implies that ''T'' preserves limits, while the condition that ''B'' is faithfully flat implies that ''T'' reflects isomorphisms. A coalgebra over ''T'' turns out to be essentially a ''B''-module with descent data, so the fact that ''T'' is a comonad is equivalent to the main theorem of faithfully flat descent, saying that ''B''-modules with descent are equivalent to ''A''-modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Deligne|1990|loc=§4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Catalytic triad of TEV protease.png|thumb|360px|The enzyme [[TEV protease]]{{efn|name=TEV}} contains an example of a catalytic triad of residues (red) in its [[active site]]. The triad consists of an [[aspartate]] ([[acid]]), [[histidine]] ([[Base (chemistry)|base]]) and [[serine]] ([[nucleophile]]). The [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] (black) is bound by the [[binding site]] to orient it next to the triad. {{PDB|1lvm}}]]

A '''catalytic triad''' is a set of three coordinated [[amino acid]]s that can be found in the [[active site]] of some [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buller|first=AR|author2=Townsend, CA|date=Feb 19, 2013|title=Intrinsic evolutionary constraints on protease structure, enzyme acylation, and the identity of the catalytic triad|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=110|issue=8|pages=E653–61|bibcode=2013PNAS..110E.653B|doi=10.1073/pnas.1221050110|pmc=3581919|pmid=23382230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads are most commonly found in [[hydrolase]] and [[transferase]] enzymes (e.g. [[protease]]s, [[amidase]]s, [[esterase]]s, acylases, [[lipase]]s and [[β-lactamase]]s). An [[Acid]]-[[Base (chemistry)|Base]]-[[Nucleophile]] triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for [[covalent catalysis]]. The [[Amino acid|residues]] form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]], forming a [[covalent]] intermediate which is then [[hydrolysed]] to release the [[Product (chemistry)|product]] and regenerate free enzyme. The nucleophile is most commonly a [[serine]] or [[cysteine]] amino acid, but occasionally [[threonine]] or even [[selenocysteine]]. The [[Protein tertiary structure|3D structure]] of the enzyme brings together the triad residues in a precise orientation, even though they may be far apart in the sequence ([[Protein primary structure|primary structure]]).&lt;ref name = "Stryer_Ch9"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H.

As well as [[divergent evolution]] of function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show some of the best examples of [[convergent evolution]].

== Function ==
Enzymes that contain a catalytic triad use it for one of two reaction types: either to [[hydrolysis|split]] a substrate ([[hydrolase]]s) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate ([[transferase]]s). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the [[active site]] of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. [[binding site]] and [[oxyanion hole]]) to achieve [[nucleophilic catalysis]]. These triad residues act together to make the [[nucleophile]] member highly [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]], generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.

===Mechanism===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] using a residue as a nucleophile. The reactivity of the nucleophilic residue is increased by the [[functional group]]s of the other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.

Catalysis is performed in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the [[carbonyl]] carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen to accept an electron, leading to a tetrahedral [[reaction intermediate|intermediate]]. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an [[oxyanion hole]] within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting the first half of the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an [[acyl-enzyme intermediate]]. The ejection of this first [[leaving group]] is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.

The second stage of catalysis is the resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=PhD Thesis|last=Thomas|first=Shafee,|title=Evolvability of a viral protease: experimental evolution of catalysis, robustness and specificity|date=2014|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/245207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Triad mechanism.svg|1000px|General reaction mechanism of catalysed by a catalytic triad (black): [[nucleophilic substitution]] at a [[carbonyl]] substrate (red) by a second substrate (blue). First, the enzyme's nucleophile (X) attacks the carbonyl to form a covalently linked acyl-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by the second substrate's nucleophile (X'). If the second nucleophile is the hydroxyl of water, the result is hydrolysis, otherwise the result is [[Transferase#Reactions|group transfer]] of X'.}}

==Identity of triad members==
[[File:Triad chemical mech.png|thumb|300px|A catalytic triad charge-relay system as commonly found in proteases. The acid residue (commonly [[glutamate]] or [[aspartate]]) aligns and polarises the base (usually [[histidine]]) which activates the nucleophile (often serine or cysteine, occasionally [[threonine]]). The triad reduces the [[pKa|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the nucleophilic residue which then attacks the substrate. An [[oxyanion hole]] of positively charged usually backbone [[amide]]s (occasionally side-chains) stabilise charge build-up on the substrate [[transition state]].]]

===Nucleophile===
The side-chain of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. The lone pair of electrons present on the oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive [[carbonyl]] carbon.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The 20 [[amino acid#Standard amino acids|naturally occurring biological amino acids]] do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult [[catalytic reaction]]s. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the [[hydroxyl]] (OH) of serine and the [[thiol]]/thiolate ion (SH/S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) of cysteine.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; Alternatively, [[threonine protease]]s use the [[secondary alcohol|secondary hydroxyl]] of threonine, however due to [[steric hindrance]] of the side chain's extra [[methyl group]] such proteases use their [[N-terminal|''N''-terminal]] amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt;

Use of oxygen or sulphur as the nucleophilic atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to [[Nucleophile#Oxygen|oxygen]], [[Nucleophile#sulphur|sulphur]]’s extra [[d orbital]] makes it larger (by 0.4 Å)&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642"&gt;{{cite journal|last = McGrath|first = ME|author2 = Wilke, ME|author3 = Higaki, JN|author4 = Craik, CS|author5 = Fletterick, RJ|title = Crystal structures of two engineered thiol trypsins.|journal = Biochemistry|date = Nov 28, 1989|volume = 28|issue = 24|pages = 9264–70|pmid = 2611228|doi = 10.1021/bi00450a005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and softer, allows it to form longer bonds (d&lt;sub href="thiol"&gt;C-X&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub href="Nucleophile#Oxygen"&gt;X-H&lt;/sub&gt; by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (by 5 units).&lt;ref name="polgár3232"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Polgár|first = L|author2 = Asbóth, B|title = The basic difference in catalyses by serine and cysteine proteinases resides in charge stabilization in the transition state.|journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology|date = Aug 7, 1986|volume = 121|issue = 3|pages = 323–6|pmid = 3540454|doi = 10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80111-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="polgár3232" /&gt; in order to achieve concerted [[deprotonation]] with catalysis.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first [[tetrahedral intermediate]] as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to [[protonate]] the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S&lt;sup href="deprotonation"&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Sterically]], the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier [[van der Waals radius]]&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; and if [[mutated]] to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642" /&gt;

Very rarely, the [[selenium]] atom of the uncommon amino acid [[selenocysteine]] is used as a nucleophile.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The deprotonated Se&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; state is strongly favoured when in a catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Base===
Since no natural amino acids are strongly nucleophilic, the base in a catalytic triad [[Chemical polarity|polarise]]s and [[deprotonate]]s the nucleophile to increase its reactivity.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; Additionally, it [[protonate]]s the first [[Product (chemistry)|product]] to aid leaving group departure.

The base is most commonly histidine since its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=G|author2=Wlodawer, A|title=Catalytic triads and their relatives.|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1998|volume=23|issue=9|pages=347–52|pmid=9787641|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01254-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[β-lactamase]]s such as [[TEM-1]] use a [[lysine]] residue as the base. Because lysine's p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is so high (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damblon|first=C|author2=Raquet, X |author3=Lian, LY |author4=Lamotte-Brasseur, J |author5=Fonze, E |author6=Charlier, P |author7=Roberts, GC |author8= Frère, JM |title=The catalytic mechanism of beta-lactamases: NMR titration of an active-site lysine residue of the TEM-1 enzyme|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Mar 5, 1996|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1747–52|pmid=8700829|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.5.1747|bibcode=1996PNAS...93.1747D |pmc=39852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jelsch|first=C|author2=Lenfant, F |author3=Masson, JM |author4= Samama, JP |title=Beta-lactamase TEM1 of E. coli.

===Acid===
The acidic triad member forms a hydrogen bond with the basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9" /&gt; Two amino acids have acidic [[Amino acid#Side chains|side chains]] at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) and so are the most commonly used for this triad member.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; [[Cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus}} uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} uses [[asparagine]] as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, [[hepatitis A]] virus protease{{efn|Hepatitis A virus protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C3}}}} contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.

==Examples of triads==

On the left are the nucleophile, base and acid triad members. On the right are different substrates with the cleaved bond indicated by a pair of scissors. Two different bonds in [[beta-lactam]]s can be cleaved (1 by [[penicillin acylase]] and 2 by [[beta-lactamase]]).]]

===Ser-His-Asp===
The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif is one of the most thoroughly characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The triad is exemplified by [[chymotrypsin]],{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=S1}}}} a model serine protease from the [[PA clan|PA superfamily]] which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an [[oxyanion hole]] consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.

The same triad has also convergently evolved in [[α/β hydrolase]]s such as some [[lipase]]s and [[esterase]]s, however [[chirality|orientation]] of the triad members is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Yueru|last2=Yin|first2=Shuhui|last3=Feng|first3=Yitao|last4=Li|first4=Jie|last5=Zhou|first5=Jiahai|last6=Liu|first6=Changdong|last7=Zhu|first7=Guang|last8=Guo|first8=Zhihong|date=2014-05-30|title=Molecular Basis of the General Base Catalysis of an α/β-Hydrolase Catalytic Triad|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/289/22/15867|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|language=en|volume=289|issue=22|pages=15867–15879|doi=10.1074/jbc.m113.535641|issn=0021-9258|pmid=24737327|pmc=4140940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauwerdink|first=Alissa|last2=Kazlauskas|first2=Romas J.|date=2015-10-02|title=How the Same Core Catalytic Machinery Catalyzes 17 Different Reactions: the Serine-Histidine-Aspartate Catalytic Triad of α/β-Hydrolase Fold Enzymes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5b01539|journal=ACS Catalysis|volume=5|issue=10|pages=6153–6176|doi=10.1021/acscatal.5b01539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, brain [[acetyl hydrolase]] (which has the same fold as a small [[G-protein]]) has also been found to have this triad. The equivalent Ser-His-''Glu ''triad is used in [[acetylcholinesterase]].

===Cys-His-Asp===
The second most studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif.&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt; Several families of [[cysteine protease]]s use this triad set, for example TEV protease{{efn|name=TEV|TEV protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C4}}}} and [[papain]].{{efn|name=papain|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}}} The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, with a few notable differences. Due to cysteine's low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, the importance of the Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. [[hepatitis A|hepatitis A virus]] protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain).&lt;ref name="beveridge1355"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beveridge|first=AJ|title=A theoretical study of the active sites of papain and S195C rat trypsin: implications for the low reactivity of mutant serine proteinases|journal=Protein Science|date=July 1996|volume=5|issue=7|pages=1355–65|pmid=8819168|pmc=2143470|doi=10.1002/pro.5560050714}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triad is also used by some amidases, such as [[Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase|''N''-glycanase]] to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The PUB Domain Functions as a p97 Binding Module in Human Peptide ''N''-Glycanase|journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry|year = 2006|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 16807242|pages = 25502–25508|volume = 281|issue = 35|doi = 10.1074/jbc.M601173200|first = Mark D.|last = Allen|first2 = Alexander|last2 = Buchberger|first3 = Mark|last3 = Bycroft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ser-His-His===
The triad of [[cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus|Cytomegalovirus protease {{MEROPS|clan=SH|fam=S21}}}} uses histidine as both the acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to &gt;10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.&lt;ref name="ekici2023"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekici|first=OD|author2=Paetzel, M |author3=Dalbey, RE |title=Unconventional serine proteases: variations on the catalytic Ser/His/Asp triad configuration.|journal=Protein Science|date=December 2008|volume=17|issue=12|pages=2023–37|pmid=18824507|doi=10.1110/ps.035436.108|pmc=2590910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ser-Glu-Asp===
An unusual triad is found in seldolisin proteases.{{efn|Seldolisin protease {{MEROPS|clan=SB|fam=53}}}} The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the glutamate carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at very low pH. The triad is hypothesised to be an [[adaptation]] to specific environments like [[acidic]] [[hot spring]]s (e.g. [[kumamolysin]]) or cell [[lysosome]] (e.g. [[tripeptidyl peptidase]]).&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt;

===Cys-His-Ser===
The [[Endothelium|endothelial]] protease [[VASH1|vasohibin]]{{efn|Vasohibin protease {{MEROPS|clan=CA}}|name=Vasohibin}} uses a cysteine as the nucleophile, but a serine to coordinate the histidine base.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanchez-Pulido|first=Luis|last2=Ponting|first2=Chris P.|date=2016-05-15|title=Vasohibins: new transglutaminase-like cysteine proteases possessing a non-canonical Cys-His-Ser catalytic triad|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/10/1441/1742608|journal=Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=32|issue=10|pages=1441–1445|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btv761|issn=1367-4803|pmc=4866520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sato|first=Yasufumi|last2=Sonoda|first2=Hikaru|date=2007-01-01|title=The Vasohibin Family: A Negative Regulatory System of Angiogenesis Genetically Programmed in Endothelial Cells|url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/27/1/37|journal=Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=37–41|doi=10.1161/01.atv.0000252062.48280.61|issn=1079-5642|pmid=17095714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the serine being a poor acid, it is still effective in orienting the histidine in the catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some homologues alternatively have a threonine instead of serine at the acid location.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Thr-Nter, Ser-Nter and Cys-Nter===
Threonine proteases, such as the [[proteasome]] protease subunit{{efn|name=Proteasome|Proteasome {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=T1}}}} and [[Glutamate N-acetyltransferase|ornithine acyltransferases]]{{efn|name=OAT|Ornithine acyltransferases {{MEROPS|clan=PE|fam=T5}}}} use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine in a manner analogous to the use of the serine [[primary alcohol|primary hydroxyl]].&lt;ref name="brannigan416"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brannigan|first=JA|author2=Dodson, G |author3=Duggleby, HJ |author4=Moody, PC |author5=Smith, JL |author6=Tomchick, DR |author7= Murzin, AG |title=A protein catalytic framework with an ''N''-terminal nucleophile is capable of self-activation|journal=Nature|date=Nov 23, 1995|volume=378|issue=6555|pages=416–9|pmid=7477383|doi=10.1038/378416a0|bibcode=1995Natur.378..416B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cheng1902"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=H|author2=Grishin, NV|title=DOM-fold: a structure with crossing loops found in DmpA, ornithine acetyltransferase, and molybdenum cofactor-binding domain.|journal=Protein Science|date=July 2005|volume=14|issue=7|pages=1902–10|pmid=15937278|doi=10.1110/ps.051364905|pmc=2253344}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the steric interference of the extra methyl group of threonine, the base member of the triad is the ''N''-terminal amide which polarises an ordered water which, in turn, [[deprotonates]] the catalytic hydroxyl to increase its reactivity.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt; Similarly, there exist equivalent 'serine only' and 'cysteine only' configurations such as [[penicillin acylase]] G{{efn|Penicillin acylase G {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=S45}}}} and [[penicillin acylase]] V{{efn|Penicillin acylase V {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=C59}}}} which are evolutionarily related to the proteasome proteases. Again, these use their ''N''-terminal amide as a base.&lt;ref name="ekici2023" /&gt;

===Ser-''cis''Ser-Lys===
This unusual triad occurs only in one superfamily of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise the middle serine.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shin|first=S|author2=Yun, YS |author3=Koo, HM |author4=Kim, YS |author5=Choi, KY |author6= Oh, BH |title=Characterization of a novel Ser-cisSer-Lys catalytic triad in comparison with the classical Ser-His-Asp triad.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Jul 4, 2003|volume=278|issue=27|pages=24937–43|pmid=12711609|doi=10.1074/jbc.M302156200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it (one with the side chain hydroxyl and the other with the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual ''[[Cis–trans isomerism|cis]]'' orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and ''cis''-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerqueira|first=N.

===Sec-His-Glu===
The rare, but naturally occurring amino acid [[selenocysteine]] (Sec), can also be found as the nucleophile in some catalytic triads.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Wolfgang|last2=Wessjohann|first2=Ludger A.|date=2005-02-04|title=The Functional Role of Selenocysteine (Sec) in the Catalysis Mechanism of Large Thioredoxin Reductases: Proposition of a Swapping Catalytic Triad Including a Sec-His-Glu State|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbic.200400276/abstract|journal=ChemBioChem|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=386–394|doi=10.1002/cbic.200400276|issn=1439-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenocysteine is similar to cysteine, but contains a [[selenium]] atom instead of a sulphur. An example is in the active site of [[thioredoxin reductase]], which uses the selenium for reduction of disulphide in thioredoxin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Engineered triads===
In addition to naturally occurring types of catalytic triads, [[protein engineering]] has been used to create enzyme variants with non-native amino acids, or entirely synthetic amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toscano|first=Miguel D.|last2=Woycechowsky|first2=Kenneth J.|last3=Hilvert|first3=Donald|date=2007-04-27|title=Minimalist Active-Site Redesign: Teaching Old Enzymes New Tricks|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200604205/abstract|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=46|issue=18|pages=3212–3236|doi=10.1002/anie.200604205|issn=1521-3773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads have also been inserted into otherwise non-catalytic proteins, or protein mimics.

==Divergent evolution==
The sophistication of the active site network causes residues involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly [[evolutionarily conserved]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Halabi|first = N|author2 = Rivoire, O|author3 = Leibler, S|author4 = Ranganathan, R|title = Protein sectors: evolutionary units of three-dimensional structure.|journal = Cell|date = Aug 21, 2009|volume = 138|issue = 4|pages = 774–86|pmid = 19703402|doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.038|pmc=3210731}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis.

=== Reaction changes ===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate is resolved by water, the result is hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a [[transferase]]. For example, attack by an [[acyl]] group results in an [[acyltransferase]] reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sinapoyltransferases in the light of molecular evolution|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942209002970|journal = Phytochemistry|date = October 2009|pages = 1652–1662|volume = 70|series = Evolution of Metabolic Diversity|issue = 15–16|doi = 10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.07.023|first = Felix|last = Stehle|first2 = Wolfgang|last2 = Brandt|first3 = Milton T.|last3 = Stubbs|first4 = Carsten|last4 = Milkowski|first5 = Dieter|last5 = Strack|pmid=19695650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In different members of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, the Ser-His-Asp triad is tuned by surrounding residues to perform at least 17 different reactions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimitriou|first=Polytimi S.|last2=Denesyuk|first2=Alexander|last3=Takahashi|first3=Seiji|last4=Yamashita|first4=Satoshi|last5=Johnson|first5=Mark S.|last6=Nakayama|first6=Toru|last7=Denessiouk|first7=Konstantin|date=2017-10-01|title=Alpha/beta-hydrolases: A unique structural motif coordinates catalytic acid residue in 40 protein fold families|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.25338/abstract|journal=Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=85|issue=10|pages=1845–1855|doi=10.1002/prot.25338|issn=1097-0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these reactions are also achieved with mechanisms that have altered formation, or resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, or that don't proceed via an acyl-enzyme intermediate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Additionally, an alternative transferase mechanism has been evolved by [[amidophosphoribosyltransferase]]s, which has two active sites.{{efn|amidophosphoribosyltransferase {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=C44}}}} In the first active site, a cysteine triad hydrolyses a [[glutamine]] substrate to release free ammonia.

Divergent evolution of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease [[Protein superfamily|superfamilies]] have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This can be inferred when a superfamily (with the same [[protein structure|fold]]) contains [[protein family|families]] that use different nucleophiles.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.&lt;ref name="pmid19892822"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Within protease superfamilies that contain a mixture of nucleophiles (e.g. the [[PA clan]]), families are designated by their catalytic nucleophile (C=cysteine proteases, S=serine proteases).

}}

The [[enzymology]] of proteases provides some of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme [[Superfamily (proteins)|superfamilies]]. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different [[Protein tertiary structure|structural fold]]. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt;

=== Cysteine and serine hydrolases ===
The same triad geometries been converged upon by serine proteases such as the [[chymotrypsin]]{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin}} and [[subtilisin]] superfamilies. Similar convergent evolution has occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral [[C3 protease]] and [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

=== Threonine proteases ===
Threonine proteases use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a methyl group). This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or histidine base.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; When the nucleophile of a serine protease was mutated to threonine, the methyl occupied a mixture of positions, most of which prevented substrate binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelc|first=Leslie A.|last2=Chen|first2=Zhiwei|last3=Gohara|first3=David W.|last4=Vogt|first4=Austin D.|last5=Pozzi|first5=Nicola|last6=Di Cera|first6=Enrico|date=2015-02-24|title=Why Ser and Not Thr Brokers Catalysis in the Trypsin Fold|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|journal=Biochemistry|volume=54|issue=7|pages=1457–1464|doi=10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|issn=0006-2960|pmc=4342846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it ''N''-terminus.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

Two evolutionarily independent [[enzyme superfamilies]] with different protein folds are known to use the ''N''-terminal residue as a nucleophile: Superfamily PB (proteasomes using the Ntn fold)&lt;ref name="brannigan416" /&gt; and Superfamily PE ([[acetyltransferase]]s using the DOM fold)&lt;ref name="cheng1902" /&gt; This commonality of [[active site]] structure in completely different protein folds indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those superfamilies.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4881">'''Children of a Dead Earth''' is a space warfare game released in 2016 featuring realistic orbital mechanics and battle tactics.

== Development and reception ==
The game was developed by Q Switched Productions, LLC and was released on 23 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.awargamersneedfulthings.co.uk/2016/10/children-of-dead-earth-review.html|title=Children of a Dead Earth Review|work=A Wargamers Needful Things|access-date=2018-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024035144/http://www.awargamersneedfulthings.co.uk/2016/10/children-of-dead-earth-review.html|archive-date=2018-10-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's website states that "Children of a Dead Earth was created to discover what space warfare would be like.

The [https://childrenofadeadearth.wordpress.com/ official blog] for the game contains detailed information about the science behind the game. There is also a [http://coade.wikia.com/wiki/Children_of_a_Dead_Earth_Wiki fan curated wiki].

== Plot ==
In the near future, Earth has become uninhabitable thanks to warfare and climate change. Surviving humans have left earth to rebuild and colonise other planets. Two human factions (the Republic and the United Sol Trade Alliance) emerge and begin to contest for dominance of the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChildrenOfADeadEarth|title=Children Of A Dead Earth (Video Game) - TV Tropes|website=TV Tropes|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023234245/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChildrenOfADeadEarth|archive-date=2018-10-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''City of the Caesars''' (Spanish '''Ciudad de los Césares'''), also variously known as ''City of Patagonia'', ''the Wandering City'', ''Trapalanda'' or ''Trapananda'', ''Lin Lin'' or ''Elelín'', is a [[mythical city]] of South America. It was supposedly located somewhere in [[Patagonia]], in a valley of the [[Andes]] between [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Despite being searched for during the [[colonization]] of South America, no evidence proves that it ever existed, although reports of it circulated for two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez S, 2004, ''Southern Chronicles: from the colonisation to the foundation of Ushuaia'', Rubí Ediciones, Ushuaia, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766 a Jesuit, Father José García Alsue, explored the area now part of [[Queulat National Park]] in [[Aysén Region]], Chile, searching unsuccessfully for the City of the Caesars.

==Myth==
The city is described as prosperous and rich, full of gold, silver and diamonds. At least one description says it was located in between two mountains, somewhere in the Andes mountains, one of gold and another of diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/mchilena01/temas/index.asp?id_ut=labusquedadelaciudaddeloscesares |title=La búsqueda de la Ciudad de los Césares |accessdate=19 February 2010 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430214545/http://www.memoriachilena.cl/mchilena01/temas/index.asp?id_ut=labusquedadelaciudaddeloscesares |archivedate=April 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is described as an enchanted city that appears in certain moments; or such that those who come upon it by chance in their travels forget the encounter; or such that hunters of it will walk away with mountains of fortune and treasure. Its purported founders include survivors of a Spanish shipwreck in the [[Strait of Magellan]], survivors in exile of the [[Disaster of Curalaba]], [[ghost]]s,  [[Patagon|Patagonian giants]] and survivors of the [[Inca Empire]]; indeed, one explanation of the legend is that it derived from stories told to sailors by aborigines describing the Empire of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez S, 2004, ''Southern Chronicles: from the colonisation to the foundation of Ushuaia'', Rubí Ediciones, Ushuaia, p. 51, referring to 'the de Angelis collection put together by the Argentine state press in 1835'.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
[[Charles Sheffield]]'s science fiction story "Trapalanda" (in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]],'' June, 1987) is built around a quest to find Trapalanda.

A '''cognitive distortion''' is an exaggerated or irrational thought pattern involved in the onset and perpetuation of [[psychopathological]] states, especially those more influenced by psychosocial factors, such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helmond|first=Petra|last2=Overbeek|first2=Geertjan|last3=Brugman|first3=Daniel|last4=Gibbs|first4=John C.|title=A Meta-Analysis on Cognitive Distortions and Externalizing Problem Behavior|url=https://dx.doi.org.erl.lib.byu.edu/10.1177/0093854814552842|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=245–262|doi=10.1177/0093854814552842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Aaron T. Beck]] laid the groundwork for the study of these distortions, and his student [[David D. Burns]] continued research on the topic. Burns, in ''[[The Feeling Good Handbook]]''&lt;ref name="burns"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=David D. |title=The Feeling Good Handbook: Using the New Mood Therapy in Everyday Life |location=New York |publisher=W. Morrow |year=1989 |isbn=0-688-01745-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1989), described personal and professional anecdotes related to cognitive distortions and their elimination.

Cognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately. According to the cognitive model of Beck, a negative outlook on reality, sometimes called ''negative schemas'' (or ''schemata''), is a factor in symptoms of emotional dysfunction and poorer subjective well-being. Specifically, negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.&lt;ref name="grohol"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grohol |first=John |date=2009 |title=15 Common Cognitive Distortions |url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/2009/15-common-cognitive-distortions/ |publisher=PsychCentral |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707124344/http://psychcentral.com/lib/2009/15-common-cognitive-distortions/ |archivedate=2009-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During difficult circumstances, these distorted thoughts can contribute to an overall negative outlook on the world and a depressive or anxious mental state.

Challenging and changing cognitive distortions is a key element of [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)]].

== History ==
In 1972, psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and [[cognitive therapy]] scholar Aaron T. Beck published ''Depression: Causes and Treatment.''&lt;ref name="beck"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Aaron T. |title=Depression; Causes and Treatment |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1972 |isbn=0-8122-7652-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dissatisfied with the conventional Freudian treatment of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], because there was no empirical evidence for the success of Freudian [[psychoanalysis]]. Beck's book provided a comprehensive and empirically supported theoretical model for depression — its potential causes, symptoms, and treatments. In Chapter 2, titled "Symptomatology of Depression," he described “cognitive manifestations” of depression, including low self-evaluation, negative expectations, self-blame and self-criticism, indecisiveness, and distortion of the body image.&lt;ref name="beck" /&gt;

In 1980 Burns published ''Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy''&lt;ref name="burns2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=David D. |title=Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy |location=New York |publisher=Morrow |year=1980 |isbn=0-688-03633-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (with a preface by Beck), and nine years later ''The Feeling Good Handbook'', both of which built on Beck's work.

== Main types ==
[[File:Common Cognitive Biases.png|thumb|400px|Examples of some common cognitive distortions seen in depressed and anxious individuals. People may be taught how to identify and alter these distortions as part of [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]].]]
The cognitive distortions listed below&lt;ref name="burns" /&gt; are categories of automatic thinking, and are to be distinguished from [[logical fallacy|logical fallacies]].&lt;ref name="tagg"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://daphne.palomar.edu/jtagg/cds.htm#cogdis |title=Cognitive Distortions |first=John |last=Tagg |year=1996 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Always being right===
Being wrong is unthinkable. This cognitive distortion is characterized by actively trying to prove one's actions or thoughts to be correct, and sometimes prioritizing [[self-interest]] over the feelings of another person.&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;

=== Blaming ===
{{Main|Blaming}}
The opposite of ''personalization''; holding other people responsible for the harm they cause, and especially for their [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|intentional]] or [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]].&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;

:: Example: someone blames one's spouse entirely for marital problems, instead of looking at one's own part in the problems.

=== Disqualifying the positive===
Discounting positive events.
* Example: Upon receiving congratulations, a person dismisses them out-of-hand, believing them to be undeserved, and automatically interpreting the compliment as an attempt at flattery or as arising out of naïveté.

=== Emotional reasoning ===
{{Main|Emotional reasoning}}
Presuming that negative feelings expose the true nature of things and experiencing reality as a reflection of emotionally linked thoughts. Thinking something is true, solely based on a feeling.
* Example: "I feel (i.e., think that I am) stupid or boring, therefore I must be"&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;  feeling that fear of flying in planes means planes are a very dangerous way to travel, or concluding that it's hopeless to clean one's house due to being overwhelmed by the prospect of cleaning.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

===Fallacy of change===
Relying on [[social control]] to obtain cooperative actions from another person.&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;

===Fallacy of fairness===
This is the belief that life should be fair and produces upset or angry emotions when life is perceived as failing to be fair and breaking rules to even the playing field that leads to long term ramifications.&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;

=== Mental filtering ===
Focusing entirely on negative elements of a situation to the exclusion of the positive. Also, the brain's tendency to filter information that does not conform to already-held beliefs.
* Example: After receiving comments about a work presentation, a person focuses on the single critical comment and ignores what went well.

=== Jumping to conclusions ===
{{Main|Jumping to conclusions}}
Reaching preliminary conclusions (usually negative) with little (if any) evidence. Two specific subtypes are identified:
* '''[[Telepathy|Mind reading]]''': [[Inference|Inferring]] a person's possible or probable (usually negative) thoughts from his or her [[behavior]] and [[nonverbal communication]]; taking precautions against the worst suspected case without asking the person.
** Example: A student assumes that the readers of his or her paper have already made up their minds concerning its topic, and, therefore, writing the paper is a pointless exercise.&lt;ref name="tagg" /&gt;
* '''[[Fortune-telling]]''': predicting outcomes (usually negative) of events.
** Example: Being convinced of failure before a test, when the student is in fact prepared.

=== Labeling and mislabeling ===
{{Main|Labeling theory}}
A form of overgeneralization; attributing a person's actions to his or her character instead of to an attribute. Rather than assuming the behavior to be accidental or otherwise extrinsic, one assigns a label to someone or something that is based on the inferred character of that person or thing.

* Example of labeling: Instead of believing that you made a mistake, you believe that you are a loser, because only a loser would make that kind of mistake. Or, someone who made a bad first impression considers himself or herself a "jerk", regardless of alternative, extrinsic factors.
* Example of mislabeling: A woman who places her children in a day care center is thought to be "abandoning her children to strangers," because she has violated the bond between mother and child.

=== Magnification and minimization ===
{{Main|Exaggeration|Minimisation (psychology)}}
Giving proportionally greater weight to a perceived failure, weakness or threat, or lesser weight to a perceived success, strength or opportunity, so that the weight differs from that assigned by others, such as "[[make a mountain out of a molehill|making a mountain out of a molehill]]". In depressed clients, often the positive characteristics of ''other people'' are exaggerated and their negative characteristics are understated.
* '''[[Catastrophizing]]''' – Giving greater weight to the worst possible outcome, however unlikely, or experiencing a situation as unbearable or impossible when it is just uncomfortable.
* Example: A teenager is too afraid to start driver's training because he believes he would get himself into an accident.

=== Overgeneralizing ===
Making [[hasty generalization]]s from insufficient evidence. Drawing a very broad conclusion from a single incident or a single piece of evidence. Even if something bad happens only once, it is expected to happen over and over again.&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;
* Example: A woman is lonely and often spends most of her time at home. Her friends sometimes ask her to dinner and to meet new people. She feels it is useless to even try. No one really could like her.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schimelpfening|first=Nancy|title=You Are What You Think|url=http://depression.about.com/cs/psychotherapy/a/cognitive.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personalizing ===
[[Attribution (psychology)|Attributing]] personal responsibility, including the resulting praise or blame, to events over which the person has [[illusion of control|no control]].
* Example: A mother whose child is struggling in school blames herself for being a bad mother, because she believes that her deficient parenting is responsible for her child's issues. In fact, the real cause may be something else entirely.

=== Making "must" or "should" statements ===
[[Rational emotive behavior therapy#Core beliefs that disturb humans|Making 'must' or should' statements]] was included by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] in his [[Rational emotive behavior therapy|rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT)]], an early form of CBT; he termed it "musturbation". Michael C. Graham called it "expecting the world to be different than it is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be seen as demanding particular achievements or behaviours regardless of the realistic circumstances of the situation. 
* Example: After a performance, a concert pianist believes he or she should not have made so many mistakes.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;
* In ''Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy'', David Burns clearly distinguished between pathological "should statements", moral imperatives, and social norms.

A related cognitive distortion, also present in Ellis [[Rational emotive behavior therapy|REBT]], is a tendency to [[Rational emotive behavior therapy#Core beliefs that disturb humans|'awfulize']]; to say a future scenario will be 'awful', rather than to realistically appraise the various negative and positive characteristics of that scenario.

=== Splitting (All-or-nothing thinking, black-or-white thinking, dichotomous reasoning)===
{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}
Evaluating the self, as well as events in life in extreme terms. It's either all good or all bad, either black or white, nothing in between. Even small imperfections seem incredibly dangerous and painful.
Splitting involves using terms like "always", "every" or "never" when they are false and misleading.

* Example: When an admired person makes a minor mistake, she or he renders the admiration as contempt.

== Cognitive restructuring ==
[[Cognitive restructuring]] (CR) is a popular form of therapy used to identify and reject maladaptive cognitive distortions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gil|first=Pedro J. Moreno|date=2001|title=Effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural treatment in social phobia: A meta-analytic review.|url=|journal=Psychology in Spain|volume=5|pages=17–25|via=Dialnet}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is typically used with individuals diagnosed with depression.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ryan C. |last=Martin |first2=Eric R. |last2=Dahlen |title=Cognitive emotion regulation in the prediction of depression, anxiety, stress, and anger |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |year=2005 |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=1249–1260 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In CR, the therapist and client first examine a stressful event or situation reported by the client. For example, a depressed male college student who experiences difficulty in dating might believe that his "worthlessness" causes women to reject him. Together, therapist and client might then create a more realistic cognition, e.g., "It is within my control to ask girls on dates. However, even though there are some things I can do to influence their decisions, whether or not they say yes is largely out of my control. Thus, I am not responsible if they decline my invitation." CR therapies are designed to eliminate "automatic thoughts" that include clients' dysfunctional or negative views. According to Beck, doing so reduces feelings of worthlessness, anxiety, and anhedonia that are symptomatic of several forms of mental illness.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830807378|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5.|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|others=American Psychiatric Association., American Psychiatric Association. DSM-5 Task Force.|isbn=9780890425541|edition= 5th|location=Arlington, VA|oclc=830807378}}&lt;/ref&gt; CR is the main component of Beck's and Burns's [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref name="CBT"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rush |first=A. |first2=M. |last2=Khatami |last3=Beck |first3=A. |title=Cognitive and Behavior Therapy in Chronic Depression |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=6 |issue=3 |year=1975 |pages=398–404 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(75)80116-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narcissistic defense ==
{{Main|Narcissistic defences}}
Those diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder tend to view themselves as unrealistically superior and overemphasize their strengths but understate their weaknesses.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; As such, narcissists use [[exaggeration]] and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]] to defend against psychic pain.&lt;ref name=millon2&gt;{{cite book

== Decatastrophizing ==
{{Main|Decatastrophizing}}
In [[cognitive therapy]], decatastrophizing or decatastrophization is a [[cognitive restructuring]] technique that may be used to treat cognitive distortions, such as magnification and catastrophizing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theunissen|first=Maurice|last2=Peters|first2=Madelon L.|last3=Bruce|first3=Julie|last4=Gramke|first4=Hans-Fritz|last5=Marcus|first5=Marco A.|title=Preoperative Anxiety and Catastrophizing|url=https://dx.doi.org.erl.lib.byu.edu/10.1097/AJP.0b013e31824549d6|journal=The Clinical Journal oF Pain|language=en|volume=28|issue=9|pages=819–841|doi=10.1097/ajp.0b013e31824549d6}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly seen in psychological disorders like [[anxiety]]&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; and [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791611000267 |title=Persecutory delusions and catastrophic worry in psychosis: Developing the understanding of delusion distress and persistence |journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=September 2011 |pages=349–354 |doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2011.02.003|year=2011 |last1=Moritz |first1=Steffen |last2=Schilling |first2=Lisa |last3=Wingenfeld |first3=Katja |last4=Köther |first4=Ulf |last5=Wittekind |first5=Charlotte |last6=Terfehr |first6=Kirsten |last7=Spitzer |first7=Carsten }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major features of these disorders are the subjective report of being overwhelmed by life circumstances and the incapability of affecting them. The following statements are typical:

* "This is too much work for me to do. I can't finish it before the deadline and my boss will fire me!"
* "I'll never make it into the college I want. My parents and school advisers point out that I have a good GPA, plenty of extracurricular activities that I participated in, and a solid SAT score, but my ACT score was just awful."
* "The boy I went on a date with last night hasn't called me back yet. I'm sure he hates me. I'll never get married."

The goal of CR would be to help the client change his or her perceptions so as to render the felt experience as less significant. In the first example, the client's reported incapability would be reframed so that, although perhaps not all the work will be done by the deadline, the employee's sustained effort will make it unlikely that the boss will fire him or her.

== Criticism ==
{{main|Cognitive behavioral therapy#Criticisms}}
Common criticisms of the diagnosis of cognitive distortion relate to [[epistemology]] and the theoretical basis. The implicit assumption behind the diagnosis is that the therapist is infallible and that only the [[world view]] of the therapist is correct. If the perceptions of the patient differ from those of the therapist, it may not be because of intellectual malfunctions but because the patient has different experiences. Critics claim that there is no evidence that patients suffering from e.g. depression have dysfunctional cognitive abilities. Actually, some depressed subjects appear to be “sadder but wiser”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beidel |first1=Deborah C. |title=A Critique of the Theoretical Bases of Cognitive Behavioral Theories and Therapy |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |date=1986 |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=177–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9515">{{about|the philosophical view on free will|other uses|Compatibility (disambiguation){{!}}Compatibility}}

'''Compatibilism''' is the belief that [[free will]] and [[determinism]] are mutually compatible and that it is possible to believe in both without being logically inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/|title=Compatibilism|last=Coates|first=D. Justin|last2=McKenna|first2=Michael|date=February 25, 2015|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilists believe freedom can be present or absent in situations for reasons that have nothing to do with [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/philosophy-articles-friday-phil-free-will-determinism-compatibilism/|title=Free Will Twice Defined: On the Linguistic Conflict of Compatibilism and Incompatibilism|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=October 16, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|publisher=|access-date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They define free will as freedom to act according to one's motives without arbitrary hindrance from other individuals or institutions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

For example, [[courts of law]] make judgments, without bringing in metaphysics, about whether an individual was acting of their own free will in specific circumstances. It is assumed in a court of law that someone could have acted otherwise than in reality. Otherwise, no crime would have been committed.

Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Locke|first=John|authorlink=John Locke |title=[[The Second Treatise of Civil Government]]|year=1690}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements of political liberty, such as the [[United States Bill of Rights]], assume moral liberty: the ability to choose to do otherwise than one does.

== History ==
Compatibilism was championed by the ancient [[stoics]]&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Salles, "Compatibilism: Stoic and modern." Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie 83.1 (2001): 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and medieval [[scholasticism|scholastics]] (such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]),&lt;ref&gt;As long as [[determinism]] is here understood as the principle that "nothing happens without a cause". Cf. e.g. [[Summa contra gentiles]], the part about Providence, c. 88-91. See also [[Free will#Free will as a psychological state]]. In times of the [[Counter-Reformation]] views which were close to compatibilism were held openly by at least two Catholic orders: the Jesuits ([[molinism]]) and the Dominicans.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers (like [[David Hume]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michael McKenna: Compatibilism. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Edward N. Zalta (ed.). 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the scholastics, including Thomas Aquinas, rejected what would now be called "[[incompatibilism]]"—they held that humans could do otherwise than they do, otherwise the concept of sin is meaningless. As for the Jesuits, their concern was to reconcile the claim of God's foreknowledge of who would be saved with moral agency. The term "compatibilism" itself was coined as late as the 20th century.   

During the 20th century, compatibilists presented novel arguments that differed from the classical arguments of Hume, Hobbes, and [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-514970-8| last = Kane| first = Robert| title = A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will| date = 2005|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Importantly, [[Harry Frankfurt]] popularized what are now known as [[Frankfurt cases|Frankfurt counterexamples]] to argue against incompatibilism,&lt;ref&gt;Kane 2005, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a positive account of compatibilist free will based on [[higher-order volition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kane 2005, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  Other "new compatibilists" include Gary Watson, [[Susan R. Wolf]], [[P. F. Strawson]], and [[R. Jay Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;Kane 2005, pp. 98, 101, 107, 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary compatibilists range from the philosopher and cognitive scientist [[Daniel Dennett]], particularly in his works ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'' (1984) and ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'' (2003), to the existentialist philosopher [[Frithjof Bergmann]]. Perhaps the most renowned contemporary defender of compatibilism is [[John Martin Fischer]].

== Defining free will ==
[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]]]
''Compatibilists'' often define an instance of "free will" as one in which the agent had freedom to act according to their own ''[[motivation]]''. That is, the agent was not coerced or restrained. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] famously said, "Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philosophy of American History : The Historical Field Theory|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|translator=Morris Zucker|year=1945|pages=531|chapter=On the Freedom of the Will}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, although an agent may often be free to act according to a ''motive'', the nature of that motive is determined. Also note that this definition of free will does not rely on the truth or falsity of [[causal determinism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This view also makes ''free will'' close to ''[[autonomy]]'', the ability to live according to one's own rules, as opposed to being submitted to external domination.

=== Alternatives as imaginary ===
[[File:Gotland-Froejel-Kirche 03.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Saying "there may be a person behind that door" merely expresses ignorance about the one, determined reality]]
Some compatibilists will hold both causal determinism (all effects have causes) and logical determinism (the future is already determined) to be true. Thus statements about the future (e.g., "it will rain tomorrow") are either true or false when spoken today. This compatibilist free will should not be understood as some kind of ability to have actually chosen differently in an identical situation. A compatibilist can believe that a person can choose between many choices, but the choice is always determined by external factors.&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Frankfurt (1969). "Alternate Possibilities and Moral Responsibility," ''Journal of Philosophy'' 66 (3):829-39.&lt;/ref&gt; If the compatibilist says "I may visit tomorrow, or I may not", he is saying he does not know what he will choose—if he will choose to follow the subconscious urge to go or not.

== Criticism&lt;!--'soft determinism' redirects here--&gt; ==
[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Compatibilism has much in common with so-called 'Hard Determinism', including moral systems and a belief in [[Determinism]] itself]]
Critics of compatibilism often focus on the definition(s) of free will: [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilists]] may agree that the compatibilists are showing ''something'' to be compatible with determinism, but they think that ''something'' ought not to be called "free will". Incompatibilists might accept the "freedom to act" as a ''necessary'' criterion for free will, but doubt that it is ''sufficient''. Basically, they demand more of "free will". The incompatibilists believe free will refers to ''genuine'' (e.g., absolute, ultimate) alternate possibilities for beliefs, desires, or actions, rather than merely [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] ones.

Compatibilism is sometimes called '''soft determinism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; pejoratively ([[William James]]' term).&lt;ref name=WJ/&gt; James accused them of creating a "quagmire of evasion" by stealing the name of freedom to mask their underlying determinism.&lt;ref name=WJ&gt;James, William. 1884 "The Dilemma of Determinism," Unitarian Review, September, 1884. Reprinted in ''The Will to Believe'', Dover, 1956, p.149&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] called it a "wretched subterfuge" and "word jugglery".&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"&gt;Kant, Immanuel 1788 (1952).''The Critique of Practical Reason'', in ''Great Books of the Western World'', vol. 42, Kant, Univ. of Chicago, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's argument turns on the view that, while all empirical phenomena must result from determining causes, human thought introduces something seemingly not found elsewhere in nature—the ability to conceive of the world in terms of how it ''ought'' to be, or how it might otherwise be. For Kant, subjective reasoning is necessarily distinct from how the world is empirically. Because of its capacity to distinguish ''is'' from ''ought'', reasoning can 'spontaneously' originate new events without being itself determined by what already exists.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel 1781 (1949).''The Critique of Pure Reason'', trans. Max Mueller, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt; It is on this basis that Kant argues against a version of compatibilism in which, for instance, the actions of the criminal are comprehended as a blend of determining forces and free choice, which Kant regards as misusing the word "free". Kant proposes that taking the compatibilist view involves denying the distinctly subjective capacity to re-think an intended course of action in terms of what ''ought'' to happen.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt;  [[Ted Honderich]] explains his view that the mistake of compatibilism is to assert that nothing changes as a consequence of determinism, when clearly we have lost the life-hope of origination.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, ''The Consequences of Determinism'', 1988, p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11934">'''Constructive set theory''' is an approach to [[constructivism (mathematics)|mathematical constructivism]] following the program of [[axiomatic set theory]]. That is, it uses the usual [[first-order logic|first-order]] language of classical set theory, and although of course the logic is [[constructive logic|constructive]], there is no explicit use of [[constructive type theory|constructive types]]. Rather, there are just [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], thus it can look very much like classical mathematics done on the most common [[foundation of mathematics|foundations]], namely the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] (ZFC).

== Intuitionistic Zermelo–Fraenkel ==
In 1973, [[John Myhill]] proposed a system of set theory based on [[intuitionistic logic]]&lt;ref&gt;Myhill, '' "Some properties of Intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory"'', Proceedings of the 1971 Cambridge Summer School in Mathematical Logic (Lecture Notes in Mathematics 337) (1973) pp 206-231&lt;/ref&gt; taking the most common foundation, ZFC, and throwing away the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) and the [[law of the excluded middle]] (LEM), leaving everything else as is. However, different forms of some of the ZFC axioms which are equivalent in the classical setting are inequivalent in the constructive setting, and some forms imply LEM.

The system, which has come to be known as IZF, or Intuitionistic Zermelo–Fraenkel (ZF refers to ZFC without the axiom of choice), has the usual axioms of [[axiom of extensionality|extensionality]], [[axiom of pairing|pairing]], [[axiom of union|union]], [[axiom of infinity|infinity]], [[axiom schema of separation|separation]] and [[axiom of power set|power set]]. The [[axiom of regularity]] is stated in the form of an [[epsilon-induction|axiom schema of set induction]]. Also, while Myhill used the [[axiom schema of replacement]] in his system,  IZF usually stands for the version with  [[Axiom schema of replacement#Axiom schema of collection|collection]].

While the axiom of replacement requires the relation ''φ'' to be a [[function (set theory)|function]] over the set ''A'' (that is, for every ''x'' in ''A'' there is associated exactly one ''y''), the axiom of collection does not: it merely requires there be associated at least one ''y'', and it asserts the existence of a set which collects at least one such ''y'' for each such ''x''. The [[axiom of regularity]] as it is normally stated implies LEM, whereas the form of set induction does not. The formal statements of these two schemata are:

&lt;math&gt;\forall A \; ([\forall x \in A \; \exists y \; \phi(x,y)] \to \exists B \; \forall x \in A \; \exists y \in B \; \phi(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;[\forall y \; ([\forall x \in y \; \phi(x)] \to \phi(y))] \to \forall y \; \phi(y)&lt;/math&gt;

Adding LEM back to IZF results in ZF, as LEM makes collection equivalent to replacement and set induction equivalent to regularity. Even without LEM, IZF's proof-theoretical power equals that of ZF.

=== Predicativity ===
While IZF is based on intuitionistic rather than classical logic, it is considered [[impredicative]]. It allows formation of sets using the [[axiom of separation]] with any proposition, including ones which contain [[quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s which are not bounded. Thus new sets can be formed in terms of the universe of all sets. Additionally the power set axiom implies the existence of a set of [[truth value]]s. In the presence of LEM, this set exists and has two elements. In the absence of it, the set of truth values is also considered impredicative.

== Myhill's constructive set theory ==
The subject was begun by [[John Myhill]] to provide a formal foundation for [[Errett Bishop]]'s program of constructive mathematics. As he presented it, Myhill's system CST is a constructive first-order logic with three [[many-sorted logic|sorts]]: [[natural numbers]], [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, and sets. The system is:

* Constructive first-order predicate logic with identity, and basic axioms related to the three sorts.
* The usual [[Peano axioms]] for natural numbers.
* The usual [[axiom of extensionality]] for sets, as well as one for functions, and the usual [[axiom of union]].
* A form of the [[axiom of infinity]] asserting that the collection of natural numbers (for which he introduces a constant '''N''') is in fact a set.
* Axioms asserting that the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] and [[range (mathematics)|range]] of a function are both sets. Additionally, an [[axiom of non-choice]] asserts the existence of a choice function in cases where the choice is already made. Together these act like the usual [[axiom schema of replacement|replacement axiom]] in classical set theory.
* The [[axiom of exponentiation]], asserting that for any two sets, there is a third set which contains all (and only) the functions whose domain is the first set, and whose range is the second set. This is a greatly weakened form of the [[axiom of power set]] in classical set theory, to which Myhill, among others, objected on the grounds of its [[impredicative|impredicativity]].
* The [[axiom schema of predicative separation|axiom of restricted, or predicative, separation]], which is a weakened form of the [[axiom schema of separation|separation axiom]] in classical set theory, requiring that any [[quantification (logic)|quantification]]s be bounded to another set.
* An [[axiom of dependent choice]], which is much weaker than the usual [[axiom of choice]].

== Aczel's constructive Zermelo–Fraenkel ==
[[Peter Aczel]]'s ''constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel'',&lt;ref&gt;Peter Aczel and Michael Rathjen, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130619020751/https://www.mittag-leffler.se/preprints/files/IML-0001-40.pdf ''Notes on Constructive Set Theory''], Reports Institut Mittag-Leffler, Mathematical Logic - 2000/2001, No. 40&lt;/ref&gt; or '''CZF''', is essentially IZF with its impredicative features removed. It strengthens the collection scheme, and then drops the impredicative power set axiom and replaces it with another collection scheme. Finally the separation axiom is restricted, as in Myhill's CST. This theory has a relatively simple interpretation in a version of [[constructive type theory]] and has modest proof theoretic strength as well as a fairly direct constructive and predicative justification, while retaining the language of set theory. Adding LEM to this theory also recovers full ZF.

The collection axioms are:

'''Strong collection schema''': This is the constructive replacement for the [[axiom schema of replacement]]. It states that if φ is a [[binary relation]] between sets which is ''[[Functional relation|total]]'' over a certain domain set (that is, it has at least one image of every element in the domain), then there exists a set which contains at least one image under φ of every element of the domain, and only images of elements of the domain. Formally, for any formula φ:

&lt;math&gt;\forall a ((\forall x \in a \; \exists y \; \phi(x,y)) \to \exists b \; (\forall x \in a \; \exists y \in b \; \phi(x,y)) \wedge (\forall y \in b \; \exists x \in a \; \phi(x,y)))&lt;/math&gt;

'''Subset collection schema''': This is the constructive version of the [[power set axiom]]. Formally, for any formula φ:

&lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \; \exists u \; \forall z ((\forall x \in a \; \exists y \in b \; \phi(x,y,z)) \to \exists v \in u \; (\forall x \in a \; \exists y \in v \; \phi(x,y,z)) \wedge (\forall y \in v \; \exists x \in a \; \phi(x,y,z)))&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to a single and somewhat clearer '''axiom of fullness''': between any two sets ''a'' and ''b'', there is a set ''c'' which contains a total subrelation of any  total relation between ''a'' and ''b'' that can be encoded as a set of [[ordered pair]]s. Formally:

&lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \; \exists c \subseteq P(a,b) \; \forall R \in P(a,b) \; \exists S \in c \; S \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt;

where the references to ''P(a,b)'' are defined by:

&lt;math&gt;R \in P(a,b) \iff (\forall u \in R \; \exists x \in a \; \exists y \in b \; \langle x,y \rangle = u) \wedge (\forall x \in a \; \exists y \in b \; \langle x,y \rangle \in R)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c \subseteq P(a,b) \iff \forall R \in c \; R \in P(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;

and some set-encoding of the ordered pair &lt;x,y&gt; is assumed.

The axiom of fullness implies CST's axiom of exponentiation: given two sets, the collection of all total functions from one to the other is also in fact a set.

The remaining axioms of CZF are: the axioms of [[axiom of extensionality|extensionality]], [[axiom of pairing|pairing]], [[axiom of union|union]], and [[axiom of infinity|infinity]] are the same as in ZF; and [[epsilon-induction|set induction]] and [[axiom schema of predicative separation|predicative separation]] are the same as above.

(eds.), Logic Colloquium '77, Amsterdam: North-Holland, 55–66.&lt;/ref&gt; (using the [[propositions-as-types]] approach) providing what is now seen a standard model of CZF in type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor1-first=Godehard |editor1-last=Link|title=One Hundred Years of Russell ́s Paradox: Mathematics, Logic, Philosophy|year=2004|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-019968-0| chapter =Predicativity, Circularity, and Anti-Foundation | first = M. | last= Rathjen| url=http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~rathjen/russelle.pdf}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Ingrid Lindström showed that [[non-well-founded set]]s obtained by replacing the [[axiom of foundation]] in CZF with [[Aczel's anti-foundation axiom]] (CZFA) can also be interpreted in Martin-Löf type theory.&lt;ref&gt;Lindström, Ingrid: 1989.

[[Presheaf (category theory)|Presheaf]] models for constructive set theory were introduced by Nicola Gambino in 2004.

{{Economics sidebar}}
The '''credibility thesis''' is a proposed [[Heterodox economics|heterodox]] theoretical framework for understanding how societal [[institution]]s or social rules come about and evolve. It posits that institutions emerge from intentional institution-building but never in the originally intended form.&lt;ref name=ho2014&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ho |first= Peter |last2= |first2= |date=September 2014 |title= The "credibility thesis" and its application to property rights: (In)Secure land tenure, conflict and social welfare in China |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837713001889 |journal= Land Use Policy |publisher= |volume=40 |issue= |pages=13–27 |doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2013.09.019 |access-date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, institutional development is [[endogeneity (econometrics)|endogenous]] and [[Spontaneous order|spontaneously ordered]] and institutional persistence can be explained by their credibility,&lt;ref name=Grabel&gt;{{cite journal |last= Grabel |first= Ilene |last2= |first2= |date= |title= The political economy of 'policy credibility': the new-classical macroeconomics and the remaking of emerging economies |url= http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/1/1.abstract |journal= Cambridge Journal of Economics |publisher= |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi= 10.1093/cje/24.1.1|access-date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is provided by the function that particular institutions serve rather than their theoretical or ideological form. The credibility thesis can be applied to explain, for example, why purported institutional improvements do not take hold as part of [[structural adjustment]] programs, while other economies in the developing world deliver growth despite absence of clear and strong market mechanisms such as indisputable private property rights or clearly delineated and registered [[land tenure]].

== Postulates of the credibility thesis ==
According to the credibility thesis, institutional persistence, meaning the survival and change of particular institutions through time is determined by the function of the institution and [[Actant|actors]]' expectations of the institution to play that function. The Credibility Thesis has put forward “that what ultimately determines the performance of institutions is not their form in terms of formality, privatization, or security, but their spatially and temporally defined function. In different wording, institutional function presides over form; the former can be expressed by its credibility, that is, the perceived social support at a given time and space.”&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt; In this sense, the thesis predicts that institutions that persist over time likely are credible, thus functional. If not, they would have changed or gone extinct. This principle holds for whatever form an institution may assume, regardless whether it is formal or informal, public or private, secure or insecure.

A typical example is [[sharecropping]], which has been regarded as economically inefficient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Issawi|first= Charles|last2= |first2= |date= |title= Farm Output under Fixed Rents and Share Tenancy|url= |journal= Land Economics|volume= 33|issue= 1|pages= 74–77|doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "second-best".&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 1974 p=219"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stiglitz | first=Joseph E. | title=Incentives and Risk Sharing in Sharecropping | journal=The Review of Economic Studies | publisher=Oxford University Press | volume=41 | issue=2 | year=1974 | page=219 | url=https://doi.org/10.2307%2F2296714 | doi=10.2307/2296714 | accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its persistence throughout time has challenged this premise,&lt;ref name="Byres 1983 pp. 7–40"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Byres | first=T.

Changes in institutional arrangements, such as changes from informal [[land tenure]] and [[Housing#Informal housing in developing countries|informal housing]] to a formalized real estate market or gradually declining prevalence of formal marriage or [[Custom (law)|customary rights]], are brought about by rule-making in a multi-actor playing field, where even the strongest actors cannot fully dictate institutional arrangements.In effect, when powerful actors exogenously impose institutions that contradict the evolutionary flow of endogenously emerged functions, the newly designed arrangements will invariably develop into "empty institutions" and "non credible" institutions.&lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1145–1176"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=Empty institutions, non-credibility and pastoralism: China's grazing ban, mining and ethnicity | journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies | publisher=Taylor &amp; Franci | volume=43 | issue=6 | year=2016 | pages=1145–1176 | url=https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03066150.2016.1239617 | doi=10.1080/03066150.2016.1239617 | accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An institution that appears stable and unchanging over time is often alleged to exist in an equilibrium wherein actors' conflicting interests on what form the institution should take are locked in a [[frozen conflict]]. For example, whether land holdings should be registered in a cadastre or if informal exchange of payment for use rights can suffice as confirmation of a land sale, constitute two possible institutional arrangements and either can be beneficial to different actors' interests. That no actor perceives an immediate opportunity to change the arrangement to their advantage is a sign of the credibility of the assignment and the source of the equilibrium of institutional arrangement. However, in actuality disequilibrium characterises institutional arrangements and equilibrium is transitory and rare. What is perceived as persistence of institutions is, in fact, the occurrence of infinitesimally small institutional changes over time under a veneer of apparent stability. In this context, the credibility thesis is predicated upon the notion of dynamic disequilibrium. It is also why in this respect the credibility theory is juxtaposed to [[structural functionalism]], which is based on presupposed societal equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Parsons 1985 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Parsons | first=Talcott | title=Talcott Parsons on institutions and social evolution : selected writings | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-226-64749-4 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parsons 1964 p.

A series of underlying postulates for the credibility thesis have been proposed:&lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1121–1144"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=An endogenous theory of property rights: opening the black box of institutions | journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies | publisher=Informa UK | volume=43 | issue=6 | year=2016 | pages=1121–1144 | url=https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03066150.2016.1253560 | doi=10.1080/03066150.2016.1253560 | accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Institutions are the resultant of unintentional development. Although actors have intentions, there is no agency that can externally or exogenously design institutions, as actors' actions are part of the same endogenous game.&lt;ref name="Ho 1087–1118"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ho |first= Peter |last2= |first2= |date=19 December 2013 |title= In defense of endogenous, spontaneously ordered development: institutional functionalism and Chinese property rights |url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2013.866553 |journal= Journal of Peasant Studies |publisher= |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1087–1118 |doi= 10.1080/03066150.2013.866553 |access-date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions emerge as an unanticipated outcome of actors' multitudinous interactions, in effect, are the result of an autonomous, ''Unintended Intentionality''.&lt;ref name="HoP2017"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=Unmaking China's Development | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=2017-10-13 | isbn=978-1-316-14561-6 | doi=10.1017/9781316145616 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Institutional change is driven by disequilibrium. Contrary to the notion that institutions settle around equilibrium, actors' interactions are seen as an ever-changing and conflicting process in which stable status is never reached. One could see it as a "Dynamic Disequilibrium" or institutional change as perpetual alteration, yet, with alternating speeds of change; sometimes, imperceptibly slow, sometimes, sudden and with shocks.&lt;ref name="HoP2017"/&gt;
* Institutional Form is subordinate to Function. In other words, functional adaptation as evident through the use and disuse of institutions over time and space is what matters for understanding their role in development, not their appearance.&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt;

"Given that all involved actors are constantly interested in changing institutional design, credibility cannot be measured by directly asking respondents whether they find an institution credible.

Instead it has to be operationalized through [[Proxy (statistics)|proxies]], such as the level of conflict that an institution generates, the extent of 'institutional robustness' expressed as a function of institutional lifespan and flexibility, the degree to which an institution facilitates or frustrates overall [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]], political and [[Culture change|cultural change]], and the extent to which an institution fulfils the functions it ought to perform in the eyes of social actors." &lt;ref name="KremerLieshout2009"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ho|first=Peter|editor-last=Kremer | editor-first=Monique | title=Doing good or doing better: development policies in a globalizing world | publisher=Amsterdam University Press | location=Amsterdam | year=2009 |chapter=Beyond Development Orthodoxy: Chinese Lessons in Pragmatism and Institutional Change| isbn=978-90-8964-107-6 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such ''opening of the black box'' of institutions is possible using [[Multimethodology|mixed methods]] to describe institutions in detail over time and space, which serves as an ''archaeology of institutions''. The archaeology of institutions can be understood as "an approach by which the change of institutions is meticulously recorded, interpreted and studied through the collection of data from every possible source, regardless of whether that is socio-economic, historical, ethno-anthropological, geographical, psychological or legal-political." &lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1121–1144" /&gt; An example of this, is the history of China's titling&lt;ref name="Ho2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Peter|title=Myths of tenure security and titling: Endogenous, institutional change in China's development|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=47|year=2015|pages=352–364|issn=0264-8377|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and housing ownership.&lt;ref name="PeterHo2017Cities"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=Who owns China's housing?

The proxies that can be used to measure credibility include the following:

* Actors' aggregate perceptions of institutions, which can be operationalized according to the FAT Institutional Framework (in other words, an assessment of Formal, Actual and Targeted institutions);&lt;ref name="Nor-Hisham Ho 2016 pp. 1177–1205" /&gt;
*Actors' aggregate perceptions of conflict generated by institutions in terms of "incidence, frequency, intensity (e.g., measured in terms of economic costs), the length (in time), and the nature (e.g., violent/non-violent)";&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt;
*Speed of institutional change through an institutional archaeology of temporal changes in the formal property rights structure.&lt;ref name="HoP2017"/&gt;

When credibility is assessed through these proxies, a better sense can be obtained of the current function that institutions fulfil for a group of actors. In result, one is likely better positioned to predict institutional interventions that might rally social support. Depending on the level of credibility, these can be envisioned as positioned on a gradient from condoning or non-intervention to co-opting, facilitating, prohibiting and ordaining.

The CSI Checklist (Credibility Scales and Intervention)&lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1121–1144" /&gt; was developed for this purpose.

Apart from studying credibility in real-life situations, the particular premises of the theory – endogeneity, dis-equilibrium, and functional adaptation – make it also suitable for simulation in [[agent-based model]]s.

== Emergence of the theory ==
The question of credibility first emerged along with concern about certain institutional interventions failing. In the mid-20th century [[Vilhelm Aubert]] noted that the Housemaid Law in Norway had been implemented but flaunted by all involved actors.&lt;ref name="Aubert"/&gt; The concept of credibility was initially coined as an ''explanandum'' for the success and failure of Western monetary, anti-inflationary policies in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt; A concern for the credibility of policy emerged in the latter half of the 20th century in response to frequently observed failures of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[structural adjustment]]s in the developing world associated with the [[Washington Consensus]]. Institutional reform, such as privatization, failed to deliver the predicted economic growth, not because of lacking credible commitment on part of actors but due to the absence of endogenous credibility.&lt;ref name = Grabel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao Rokpelnis 2016 pp. 1206–1223"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zhao | first=Heng | last2=Rokpelnis | first2=Karlis | title=Local perceptions of grassland degradation in China: a socio-anthropological reading of endogenous knowledge and institutional credibility | journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies | publisher=Informa UK | volume=43 | issue=6 | year=2016 | pages=1206–1223 | url=https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03066150.2016.1192609 | doi=10.1080/03066150.2016.1192609 | accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the growth of the Chinese economy despite lack of many institutions considered to be essential for economic growth indicated that institutional arrangements do not necessarily determine economic outcomes, and also at the same time economic development does not automatically lead to [[teleology|teleologically]] predetermined institutional forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/03/growth-0|title= Autocracy or democracy?|author=L.P. |date= |website= economist.com |publisher= |access-date= 2015-06-18|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/g20/topics/anti-corruption/issues-paper-on-corruption-and-economic-growth.htm|title= Issues paper on corruption and economic growth |author= OECD |date= |website= oecd.org |publisher= |access-date= 2015-06-20|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly striking in the case of [[Real estate in China|real estate sector]] in China.&lt;ref name="Ho 1087–1118"/&gt; In this context, there is a growing body of research suggesting one should focus on the function or quality of institutional performance rather than their form.&lt;ref name="Aron2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aron|first1=J.|title=Growth and Institutions: A Review of the Evidence|journal=The World Bank Research Observer|volume=15|issue=1|year=2000|pages=99–135|issn=0257-3032|doi=10.1093/wbro/15.1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AgrawalEtAl2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Agrawal | first=Arun | last2=Wollenberg | first2=E. | last3=Persha | first3=L. | title=Governing agriculture-forest landscapes to achieve climate change mitigation | journal=Global Environmental Change | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=29 | year=2014 | issn=0959-3780 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.10.001 | pages=270–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dixon2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dixon | first=Adam D. | title=Function before form: macro-institutional comparison and the geography of finance | journal=Journal of Economic Geography | publisher=Oxford University Press (OUP) | volume=12 | issue=3 | date=2012-01-19 | issn=1468-2710 | doi=10.1093/jeg/lbr043 | pages=579–600}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Ha-Joon Chang: “a big problem that dogs the current orthodox literature on development is its inability to clearly distinguish between the forms and functions of institutions.”&lt;ref name="Chang2007"&gt;{{cite book | author=Chang | title=Institutional change and economic development | publisher=United Nations University Press | publication-place=New York, NY | year=2007 | isbn=978-92-808-1143-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''credibility thesis'' was put forth by Peter Ho in 2014.&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt; In a review of the credibility thesis, Delilah Griswold contended that "credibility is a powerful metric by which to understand and evaluate tenure systems. Importantly, understanding the credibility of a given institution requires analysis outside of theory and politics, analysis that is locally and temporally specific and multilayered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://environment.yale.edu/yer/article/when-it-comes-to-the-efficacy-of-property-rights-function-can-be-more-important-than-form|title= With efficacy of property rights, function can be more important than form|last1= Griswold|first1= Delilah|last2= |first2= |date= {{date|2015-07-09}}|website= Yale Environment Review|publisher= |access-date={{date|2015-11-18}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distributed Tree Search''' (DTS) algorithm is a class of algorithms for searching values in an efficient and distributed manner. Their purpose is to iterate through a tree by working along multiple branches in parallel and merging the results of each branch into one common solution, in order to minimize time spent searching for a value in a tree-like data structure.

The original paper was written in 1988 by Chris Ferguson and Richard E. Korf, from the University of California's Computer Science Department. They used multiple other chess AIs to develop this wider range algorithm.

== Overview ==
The Distributed Tree Search Algorithm (also known as Korf-Ferguson algorithm) was created to solve the following problem : « Given a tree with non-uniform branching factor and depth, search it in parallel with an arbitrary number of processors as fast as possible. »

The top-level part of this algorithm is general and does not use a particular existing type of tree-search, but it can be easily specialized to fit any type of non-distributed tree-search.

DTS consists of using multiple processes, each with a node and a set of processors attached, with the goal of searching the sub-tree below the said node. Each process then divides itself into multiple coordinated sub-processes which recursively divide themselves again until an optimal way to search the tree has been found based on the number of processors available to each process. Once a process finishes, DTS dynamically reassigns the processors to other processes as to keep the efficiency to a maximum through good load-balancing, especially in irregular trees.

Once a process finishes searching, it recursively sends and merges a resulting signal to its parent-process, until all the different sub-answers have been merged and the entire problem has been solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaaipress.org/Papers/AAAI/1988/AAAI88-023.pdf|title=Distributed Tree Search and it's Application to Alpha-Beta Pruning|last=KORF Richard E., FERGUSON Chris|first=|date=1988|website=AAAI|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
DTS is only applicable under two major conditions: the data structure to search through is a tree, and the algorithm can make use of at least one computation unit (Although it cannot be considered as distributed if there is only one).

One major example of the everyday use of DTS is network routing. The Internet can be seen as a tree of IP addresses, and an analogy to a routing protocol could be how post offices work in the real world. Since there are over 4.3 billion IP addresses currently, society heavily depends on the time the data takes to find its way to its destination. As such, IP-routing divides the work into multiple sub-units which each have different scales of calculation capabilities and use each other's result to find the route in a very efficient manner. This is an instance of DTS that affects over 43% of the world's population, for reasons going from entertainment to national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metaswitch.com/resources/what-is-ip-routing|title=What is IP Routing ?|last=|first=|date=2016|website=MetaSwitch|publisher=MetaSwitch Networks|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives ==
Although DTS is currently one of the most widely used algorithms, many of its applications have alternatives to them which could potentially develop into more efficient, less resource-demanding solutions, were they more researched.

One of the more controversial examples is Big-Data processing. In applications like Google Search Engine, Facebook, YouTube, search needs to be optimized to keep waiting time inside a reasonable window. This could be achieved through the plain use of DTS, but other algorithms are used in place (for example data-hashing in SQL databases), or in conjunction (Facebook's Haystack algorithm groups parallel tree-search, data-hashing and memory-ordering/sorting).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/685565858139515/needle-in-a-haystack-efficient-storage-of-billions-of-photos/|title=Needle in a Haystack : Efficient Storage of Billions of Photos|last=Vajgel|first=Peter|date=April 30, 2009|website=Facebook|publisher=Facebook (company)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more important limits of DTS is the fact that it requires a tree as input. Trees are a sub-instance of a data structure known as Graphs, which means every Graph can be converted into a tree. Although there currently exists no better way to search through trees than Korf-Ferguson's algorithm, each task has different particularities and in most cases, there will exist more efficient data structures to represent the problem and solve it than through tree-search. And so there exist instances of tree structures with cycles that cannot possibly be faster than a graph-search on the same structure with the same processing power.

== Controversy ==
There are few controversies around Korf-Ferguson's DTS algorithm, since it is recognized as very complete, but simple. It is very often used as a stepping stone for students to discover the fundamentals and key concepts of distributed problem-solving.

The most important challenge to this algorithmic concept was an article by Kröll B, « Balanced Distributed Sarch Trees Do Not Exist », which does not attack the veracity or current efficiency of the algorithm, but rather the fact that DTS itself, no matter how many improvements are made to it (for example balancing the input tree before-hand), will never be able to reach optimal resolution-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-60220-8_50|title=Balanced distributed search trees do not exist|last=Kröll|first=Brigitte|last2=Widmayer|first2=Peter|date=1995-08-16|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540602200|editor-last=Akl|editor-first=Selim G.|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=50–61|language=en|editor-last2=Dehne|editor-first2=Frank|editor-last3=Sack|editor-first3=Jörg-Rüdiger|editor-last4=Santoro|editor-first4=Nicola}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opens a new view point : are too many resources used into the completion of DTS, which blocks new algorithms with higher efficiency-potential from getting researched and developed ? Another limit of DTS is the fact that no matter how efficient the division, coordination and merging of the solutions is, it will always be limited by the material number or processors and their processing power. Until recently, this was admitted as being a limit to nearly every computation, but new-generation algorithms like Euclideon might one day be able to crush DFS's efficiency through processing-power-independent problem resolution.

'''Etiquette''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|t|ᵻ|ˌ|k|ɛ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|t|ᵻ|k|ᵻ|t}}, {{IPA-fr|e.ti.kɛt|lang}}) is a [[Ethical code|code of behavior]] that delineates expectations for [[social behavior]] according to contemporary [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] within a [[society]], [[social class]], or [[Group (sociology)|group]].

The French word ''[[wikt:étiquette|étiquette]]'', literally signifying a tag or label, was used in a modern sense in English around 1750.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', "Etiquette".&lt;/ref&gt; Etiquette is behaviour that assists survival and has changed and evolved over the years.

==History==
[[File:Zuidgevel Corps de logis rond 1675 Anonieme schilder.jpg|thumb|[[Louis XIV]]'s court at the [[Palace of Versailles]] developed an elaborate form of etiquette.]]

In the 3rd millennium BC, [[Ptahhotep]] wrote ''[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]]''. The Maxims were conformist precepts extolling such civil virtues as truthfulness, self-control and kindness towards one's fellow beings. Learning by listening to everybody and knowing that human knowledge is never perfect are a [[leitmotif]]. Avoiding open conflict wherever possible should not be considered weakness. Stress is placed on the pursuit of [[justice]], although it is conceded that it is a god's command that prevails in the end. Some of the maxims refer to one's behaviour when in the presence of the great, how to choose the right master and how to serve him. Others teach the correct way to lead through openness and kindness. Greed is the base of all evil and should be guarded against, while generosity towards family and friends is deemed praiseworthy.

[[Confucius]] (551–479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher whose philosophy emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity.

[[Baldassare Castiglione]] (Italian: [baldasˈsaːre kastiʎˈʎoːne]; December 6, 1478 – February 2, 1529), count of Casatico, was an Italian courtier, diplomat, soldier and a prominent Renaissance author, who is probably most famous for his authorship of The Book of the Courtier. The work was an example of a courtesy book, dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier, and was very influential in 16th century European court circles.

[[Louis XIV]] (1638–1718) "transformed a royal hunting lodge in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], a village 25 miles southwest of the capital, into one of the largest palaces in the world, officially moving his court and government there in 1682. It was against this awe-inspiring backdrop that Louis tamed the [[nobility]] and impressed foreign dignitaries, using entertainment, ceremony and a highly codified system of etiquette to assert his supremacy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/louis-xiv|title=Louis XIV|publisher=[[History.com]]|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politeness===
{{Main article|Politeness}}
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Members of a [[Gentlemen's club]] had to conform to a socially acceptable standard of politeness. The painting, ''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]

During the [[Enlightenment era]], a self-conscious process of the imposition of polite norms and behaviours became a symbol of being a genteel member of the upper class. Upwardly mobile [[middle class]] [[bourgeoisie]] increasingly tried to identify themselves with the elite through their adopted artistic preferences and their standards of behaviour. They became preoccupied with precise rules of etiquette, such as when to show [[emotion]], the art of elegant dress and graceful conversation and how to act courteously, especially with women. Influential in this new discourse was a series of essays on the nature of politeness in a commercial society, penned by the philosopher [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] in the early 18th century. Shaftesbury defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company:
:'Politeness' may be defined a dext'rous management of our words and actions, whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Third Earl of Shaftesbury and the Progress of Politeness|jstor = 2738536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodicals, such as ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', founded as a daily publication by [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]] in 1711, gave regular advice to its readers on how to conform to the etiquette required of a polite gentleman. Its stated goal was "to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality... to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses" It provided its readers with educated, topical talking points, and advice in how to carry on conversations and social interactions in a polite manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=888|title=Information Britain|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The allied notion of 'civility' – referring to a desired social interaction which valued sober and reasoned debate on matters of interest – also became an important quality for the 'polite classes'.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 2005. p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Established rules and procedures for proper behaviour as well as etiquette conventions, were outlined by [[gentlemen's club]]s, such as Harrington's Rota Club. Periodicals, including ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', infused politeness into English coffeehouse conversation, as their explicit purpose lay in the reformation of English manners and morals.&lt;ref name="Mackie, 1998. p 1"&gt;Mackie, 1998. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Etiquette is the virtue of morality and code of behaviour.

[[Image:Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield by William Hoare.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|The Earl of Chesterfield]] invented the term 'etiquette' in the mid-18th century. Painting by [[William Hoare]].]]
It was [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield]] who first used the word 'etiquette' in its modern meaning, in his ''Letters to His Son on the Art of Becoming a Man of the World and a Gentleman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=de&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:1848546661 |title=Sorry! The English and Their Manners |author=Henry Hitchings |year=2013 |publisher=Hachette UK |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work comprised over 400 letters written from 1737 or 1738 and continuing until his son's death in 1768, and were mostly instructive letters on various subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, Christopher. "Letters To His Son". The Literary Encyclopedia. First published 25 February 2007 [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=21002, accessed 30 November 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were first published by his son's widow [[Eugenia Stanhope]] in 1774. Chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the issue of manners from conventional morality, arguing that mastery of etiquette was an important weapon for social advancement. The Letters were full of elegant wisdom and perceptive observation and deduction. Chesterfield epitomised the restraint of polite 18th-century society, writing, for instance, in 1748:
{{quote|
I would heartily wish that you may often be seen to smile, but never heard to laugh while you live. Frequent and loud laughter is the characteristic of folly and ill-manners; it is the manner in which the mob express their silly joy at silly things; and they call it being merry. In my mind there is nothing so illiberal, and so ill-bred, as audible laughter. I am neither of a melancholy nor a cynical disposition, and am as willing and as apt to be pleased as anybody; but I am sure that since I have had the full use of my reason nobody has ever heard me laugh.
}}

By the [[Victorian era]], etiquette had developed into an exceptionally complicated system of rules, governing everything from the proper method for writing letters and using [[cutlery]] to the minutely regulated interactions between different classes and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Tudor Rose" |title=Victorian Society |publisher=AboutBritain.com |date=1999–2010 |url=http://www.aboutbritain.com/articles/victorian-society.asp |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manners==
[[File:High-Change-in-Bond-Street-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''High-Change in Bond Street,—ou—la Politesse du Grande Monde'' (1796), [[James Gillray]] caricatured the lack of etiquette in a group of men leering at women and crowding them off a pavement.]]

Manners are described as good or bad to indicate whether or not a behavior is socially acceptable. Every culture adheres to a different set of manners, although a lot of manners are cross-culturally common. Manners are a subset of social norms which are informally enforced through self-regulation and social policing and publicly performed. They enable human ‘ultrasociality’ &lt;ref&gt;Richerson and Boyd, [http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/ultra.pdf "The Evolution of Human Ultra Sociality"], ''In press: I. Eibl-Eibisfeldt and F. Salter, eds. Ideology, Warfare, and Indoctrinability'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; by imposing self-restraint and compromise on regular, everyday actions.

=== Sociology perspectives===
In his book [[The Civilizing Process]], [[Norbert Elias]] &lt;ref&gt;Norbert Elias, [http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/ultra.pdfhttp://www.norberteliasfoundation.nl/ "The Civilizing Process"], ''Oxford Blackwell Publishers'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; argued that manners arose as a product of group living and persist as a way of maintaining social order.  He theorized that manners proliferated during the [[Renaissance]] in response to the development of the ‘absolute state’ – the progression from small group living to the centralization of power by the state. Elias believed that the rituals associated with manners in the Court Society of England during this period were closely bound with social status. To him, manners demonstrate an individual’s position within a social network and act as a means by which the individual can negotiate that position.

Petersen and Lupton argue that manners helped reduce the boundaries between the [[public sphere]] and the [[private sphere]] and gave rise to ''“a highly reflective self, a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts socially.”'' They explain that; ''“The public behavior of ''individuals came to signify their social standing, a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others and thus the control of the outward self was''
''vital.”'' &lt;ref&gt;Petersen A., Lupton D., [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_New_Public_Health.html?id=RofiHHQddx0C "The Healthy Citizen"], in The New Public Health – Discourses, Knowledges,
Strategies, ''London, SAGE'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, manners are seen not just as a means of displaying one’s [[social status]], but also as a
means of  maintaining social
boundaries relative to class and identity.

[[Pierre Bourdieu]]’s notion of ''‘[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]’'' can also contribute to the understanding of manners.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu P., [http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9780511812507 "Outline of a Theory of Practice], ''Cambridge, Cambridge University Press'', 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The habitus, he explains, is a set of ''‘dispositions’'' that are
neither self-determined, nor pre-determined, by external environmental factors. They tend to operate at a subconscious level and are ''“inculcated through experience and explicit teaching”'' &lt;ref&gt;Jenkins R., [https://books.google.com/books/about/Pierre_Bourdieu.html?id=aPVaHgUx1f0C "Pierre Bourdieu (Key Sociologists)], ''Cornwall, Routledge'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and produced and reproduced by social interactions. Manners, in this view, are likely to be a central part of the ''‘dispositions’'' which guide an individual’s ability to make socially compliant behavioral decisions.

===Anthropology perspectives===
Anthropologists concern themselves primarily with detailing cultural variances and differences in ''‘ways of seeing’.''  Theorists such as [[Mary Douglas]] have
claimed that each culture’s unique set of manners, behaviors and rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or
defile it.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas M., [http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/schloesser/HS041-042/fall/w04/resources/DOUGLAS_Purity-Danger.pdf "Purity and Danger – An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo] ''London, Routledge'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, she suggests that ideas of pollution and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behavior to curtail such actions and
maintain''“ the assumptions by which experience is controlled.”''

=== Evolutionary biology perspectives===
Evolutionary biology looks at the origin of  behavior and the motivation behind it. [[Charles Darwin]] analyzed the remarkable universality of facial responses to [[disgust]], [[shame]] and other complex emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C., [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=1&amp;itemID=F1142&amp;viewtype=text ''The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals''] London, Penguin, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Having identified the same behavior in young infants and blind individuals he concluded that these responses are not learned but innate. According to [[Val Curtis]],&lt;ref&gt;Curtis V.,[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do#.Ul6c1BAwK8A ''Don’t Look, Don't Touch – The Science Behind Revulsion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728230238/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do |date=2014-07-28 }} Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013&lt;br&gt;Curtis V. Aunger R, Rabie T.,[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/271/Suppl_4/S131.abstract "Evidence that disgust evolved to protect from risk of disease] ''Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'', '''271 Suppl''': S131–33., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the development of these responses was concomitant with the development of manners behavior. For Curtis, manners play an evolutionary role in the prevention of [[disease]]. This assumes that those who were hygienic, polite to others and most able to benefit from their membership within a cultural group, stand the best
chance of survival and reproduction.

Catherine Cottrell and [[Steven Neuberg]] explore how our behavioral responses to ‘otherness’ may enable the preservation of manners and norms.&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Bases of Prejudices"&gt;Neuberg SL., Cottrell CA.,[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=aJe9fLi8pW0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=%28Cottrell+%26+Neuberg+2005%29.+evolutionary+bases+of+prejudice&amp;ots=RKGAer-6uw&amp;sig=nDTy2QDmZca9l36r9D3vs9idnQQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%28Cottrell%20%26%20Neuberg%202005%29.%20evolutionary%20bases%20of%20prejudice&amp;f=false "Evolutionary Bases of Prejudices"] in Schaller M. et al., ed. ''Evolution and Social Psychology''. New York, Psychology Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that the foreignness or unfamiliarity we experience when interacting with different cultural groups for the first time, may partly serve an evolutionary function: ''“Group living surrounds one with individuals able to physically harm fellow group members, to spread contagious disease, or to “free ride” on their efforts. A commitment to sociality thus carries a risk: If threats such as these are left unchecked, the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits. Thus, to maximize the returns on group ''living, individual group members should be attuned to others’ features or behaviors.”''&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Bases of Prejudices"/&gt;

Thus, people who possess similar traits, common to the group, are to be trusted, whereas those who do not are to be considered as ‘others’ and treated with suspicion or even exclusion. Curtis argues that selective pressure borne out of a shift towards [[communal living]] would have resulted in individuals being shunned from the group for hygiene lapses or uncooperative behavior. This would have led to people avoiding actions that might result in embarrassment or others being disgusted.&lt;ref name="ukcatalogue.oup.com"&gt;Curtis V.,[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do#.Ul6c1BAwK8A "Don’t Look, Don't Touch – The Science Behind Revulsion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728230238/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do |date=2014-07-28 }} Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Henrich]] and [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] developed a
model to demonstrate this process at work. They explain [[natural selection]] has favored the acquisition of genetically transmitted learning mechanisms that increase an individual’s chance of acquiring locally adaptive behavior. They hypothesize that: ''“Humans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms (common beliefs or practices) and punish individuals who do not punish norm violators.”''&lt;ref&gt;Henrich J, Boyd R., [http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138%2898%2900018-X/abstract "The Evolution of Conformist Transmission and the Emergence of Between Group Differences"]''Evolution and Human Behavior'', '''19(4)''':215–41, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; From this approach, manners are a means of mitigating undesirable behavior and fostering the benefits of in-group cooperation.

===Types===
Curtis also specifically outlines three manner categories; [[hygiene]], [[courtesy]] and cultural [[Norm (social)|norms]], each of which help to account for the multifaceted role manners play in society.&lt;ref name="ukcatalogue.oup.com"/&gt;
These categories are based on the outcome rather than the motivation of manners behavior and individual manner behaviors may fit into 2 or more categories.

'''Hygiene Manners''' – are any manners which affect [[disease transmission]]. They are likely to be taught at an early age, primarily through parental discipline, positive behavioral
enforcement of continence with bodily fluids (such as toilet training), and the avoidance or removal of items that pose a disease risk for children. It is expected that,
by adulthood, hygiene manners are so entrenched in one’s behavior that they become second nature.  Violations are likely to elicit [[disgust]] responses.

'''Courtesy Manners''' – demonstrate one’s ability to put the interests of others before oneself; to display self-control and good intent for the purposes of being trusted
in social interactions. Courtesy manners help to maximize the benefits of group living by regulating social interaction. Disease avoidance behavior can sometimes be compromised in the performance of courtesy manners. They may be taught in the same way as hygiene manners but are likely to also be learned through direct,
indirect (i.e. observing the interactions of others) or imagined (i.e. through the [[executive functions]] of the brain) social interactions. The learning of courtesy manners may take place
at an older age than hygiene manners, because individuals must have at least some means of communication and some awareness of self and social positioning.
The violation of courtesy manners most commonly results in social disapproval from peers.

'''Cultural Norm Manners''' – typically demonstrate one’s [[Identity (social science)|identity]] within a specific socio-cultural group. Adherence to cultural norm manners allows for the demarcation of socio-cultural identities and the creation of boundaries which inform who is to be trusted or who is to be deemed as ‘other’. Cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation and routinisation of ‘the familiar’ and through exposure to ‘otherness’ or those who are identified as foreign or different. Transgressions and non-adherence to cultural norm manners commonly result in [[Social alienation|alienation]]. Cultural norms, by their very nature, have a high level of between-group variability but are likely to be common to all those who identify with a given group identity.

Rules of etiquette encompass most aspects of social interaction in any society, though the term itself is not commonly used. A rule of etiquette may reflect an underlying [[ethical code]], or it may reflect a person's [[fashion]] or [[Social status|status]]. Rules of etiquette are usually unwritten, but aspects of etiquette have been codified from time to time.

===Books===
[[Baldassare Castiglione]] was an Italian courtier, diplomat, soldier and a prominent Renaissance author, who is probably most famous for his authorship of The Book of the Courtier. The work was an example of a courtesy book, dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier, and was very influential in 16th century European court circles.

[[Erasmus]] of Rotterdam published his book ''On Good Manners for Boys'' in 1530. Amid his advice for young children on [[fidgeting]], [[yawning]], bickering and scratching he highlights that a core tenet of manners is the ability to “''readily ignore the faults of others but avoid falling short yourself''”.&lt;ref&gt;Rotterdam, E. of. (1536). ''A Handbook on Good Manners for Children: De Civilitate Morum Puerilium Libellus''. (E. Merchant, Ed.) (English tr.). London: Preface Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In centuries since then, many authors have tried to collate manners or etiquette guide books. One of the most famous of these was [[Emily Post]] who began to document etiquette in 1922. She described her work as detailing the “''trivialities''” of desirable everyday conduct but also provided descriptions of appropriate conduct for key life events such as [[baptism]]s, [[wedding]]s and [[funeral]]s. She later established an institute which continues to provide updated advice on how to negotiate modern day society with good manners and decorum. The most recent edition of her book provides advice on such topics as when it is acceptable to ‘unfriend’ someone on Facebook and who is entitled to which armrest when flying.&lt;ref&gt;Post, P., Post, A., Post, L., &amp; Senning, D. P. (2011). Emily Post’s Etiquette, 18th Edition (Emily Post's Etiquette). New York: William Morrow.&lt;/ref&gt; Etiquette books such as these as well as those by [[Amy Vanderbilt]],&lt;ref&gt;Vanderbilt, A. (1957). Amy Vanderbilt’s Complete Book Of Etiquette.

London: Profile Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; outline suggested behaviours for a range of social interactions. However, all note that to be a well-mannered person one must not merely read their books but be able to employ good manners fluidly in any situation that may arise.

===Western office and business===
The etiquette of business is the set of written and unwritten rules of conduct that make social interactions run more smoothly. Office etiquette in particular applies to coworker interaction, excluding interactions with external contacts such as customers and suppliers. When conducting group meetings in the United States, the assembly might follow ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'', if there are no other company policies to control a meeting.

These rules are often echoed throughout an industry or economy. For instance, 49% of employers surveyed in 2005 by the American National Association of Colleges and Employers found that non-traditional attire would be a "strong influence" on their opinion of a potential job candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=50 |number=3 |title=Blue hair, body piercings--do employers care? |work=Grab Bag |publisher=Occupational Outlook Quarterly |date=Fall 2006 |url=http://stats.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2006/fall/grabbag.htm#B |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Business Etiquette at companies such as [[IBM]] influence global business etiquette and professional standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Joseph J|title=How they did it: Sharon Hill|url=http://simplebooklet.com/publish.php?wpKey=JWi8pGQwRiArQNq8XrLfwd#page=72|work=FYI Magazine|issue=August|date=2015|quote=Sharon was a rising start at IBM.  After a long span of promotions and top  performance reviews, her career changed with one of IBM's Vice Presidents choose to cut the number of employees at the company.  Sharon explains “My worldwide success, customer loyalty, and employee praise meant nothing. My department was cut and it was time to decide what I would do next in my life. That’s when I decided to follow my passion and start my own company. I got certified as an Etiquette trainer and was off and running. To this day, I thank IBM for teaching me professionalism and giving me the business acumen needed to start my business.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both office and business etiquette overlap considerably with basic tenets of [[netiquette]], the social conventions for using computer networks.

Business etiquette can vary significantly in different countries, which is invariably related to their culture. For example: A notable difference between Chinese and Western business etiquette is conflict handling.  Chinese businesses prefer to look upon relationship management to avoid conflicts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Ho-Ching Wei" |title=Chinese-Style Conflict Resolution: A Case of Taiwanese Business Immigrants in Australia |publisher=University of Western Sydney |url=http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2000v9n2/5%20Ho-Ching%20Wei.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123080428/http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2000v9n2/5%20Ho-Ching%20Wei.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – stemming from a culture that heavily relies on ''[[guanxi]]'' (personal connections) – while the west leaves resolution of conflict to the interpretations of law through contracts and lawyers.

Adjusting to foreign etiquettes is a major complement of [[culture shock]], providing a market for manuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Mente |first=Boyd |title=Chinese Etiquette &amp; Ethics in Business |publisher= NTC Business Books |location=Lincolnwood |year=1994 |isbn=0-8442-8524-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other resources include business and diplomacy institutions, available only in certain countries such as the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Institute of Diplomacy and Business  |url=http://www.diplomacyandbusiness.com/ |accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a group of etiquette experts and international business group formed a non-profit organization called IITTI (pronounced as "''ET''") to help human resource (HR) departments of multinationals in measuring the etiquette skills of prospective new employees during the recruitment process by standardizing image and etiquette examination, similar to what ISO does for industrial process measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iitti.org/about/about.htm|title=IITTI website "About Us"|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913174240/http://www.iitti.org/about/about.htm|archivedate=13 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etiquette in [[retail]] is sometimes summarized as "The customer is always right." {{quote|There are always two sides to the case, of course, and it is a credit to good manners that there is scarcely ever any friction in stores and shops of the first class. Salesmen and women are usually persons who are both patient and polite, and their customers are most often ladies in fact as well as "by courtesy." Between those before and those behind the counters, there has sprung up in many instances a relationship of mutual goodwill and friendliness. It is, in fact, only the woman who is afraid that someone may encroach upon her exceedingly insecure dignity, who shows neither courtesy nor consideration to any except those whom she considers it to her advantage to please.
[[Emily Post]] ''Etiquette'' 1922}}

==Cultural differences==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
[[File:AndriesBothLicehunting.jpg|thumb|''Hunting Lice by Candlelight'', [[Andries Both]] (Dutch, c. 1612/13 – 1641)]]

Etiquette is dependent on [[culture]]; what is excellent etiquette in one society may shock another. Etiquette evolves within culture. The Dutch painter [[Andries Both]] shows that the hunt for [[head lice]] (''illustration, right''), which had been a civilized grooming occupation in the early Middle Ages, a bonding experience that reinforced the comparative rank of two people, one groomed the other, one was the subject of the groomer, had become a peasant occupation by 1630. The painter portrays the familiar operation matter-of-factly, without the disdain this subject would have received in a 19th-century representation.

Etiquette can vary widely between different cultures and nations. For example, in [[Hausa people|Hausa]] culture, eating while standing may be seen as offensively casual and ill-omened behavior, insulting the host and showing a lack of respect for the scarcity of food—the offense is known as "eating with the devil" or "committing ''santi''." In China, a person who takes the last item of food from a common plate or bowl without first offering it to others at the table may be seen as a glutton who is insulting the host's generosity. Traditionally, if guests do not have leftover food in front of them at the end of a meal, it is to the dishonour of the host. In the United States of America, a guest is expected to eat all of the food given to them, as a compliment to the quality of the cooking. However, it is still considered polite to offer food from a common plate or bowl to others at the table.

In such rigid hierarchal cultures as Korea and Japan, alcohol helps to break down the strict social barrier between classes. It allows for a hint of informality to creep in. It is traditional for host and guest to take turns filling each other's cups and encouraging each other to gulp it down. For someone who does not consume alcohol (except for religious reasons), it can be difficult escaping the ritual of the social drink.&lt;ref name="IBC"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Charles |title=Short Course in International Business Culture |publisher=World Trade Press |location=San Rafael |year=1999 |isbn=1-885073-54-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etiquette is a topic that has occupied writers and thinkers in all sophisticated societies for millennia, beginning with a behavior code by [[Ptahhotep]], a vizier in ancient Egypt's [[Old Kingdom]] during the reign of the Fifth Dynasty king [[Djedkare Isesi]] (c. 2414–2375 BC). All known literate civilizations, including ancient Greece and Rome, developed rules for proper social conduct. [[Confucius]] included rules for eating and speaking along with his more philosophical sayings.
[[File:High-change in Bond Street, - ou - la politesse du grande monde by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|High-change in Bond Street, - ou - la politesse du grande monde by James Gillray]]
[[Early modern]] conceptions of what behavior identifies a "[[gentleman]]" were codified in the 16th century, in a book by [[Baldassare Castiglione]], ''Il Cortegiano'' ("The Courtier"); its codification of expectations at the court of Urbino remained in force in its essentials until [[World War I]]. [[Louis XIV]] established an elaborate and rigid court ceremony, but distinguished himself from the high bourgeoisie by continuing to eat, stylishly and fastidiously, with his fingers. An important book about etiquette is ''[[Il Galateo]]'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]]; in fact, in [[Italian language|Italian]], etiquette is generally called ''galateo'' (or ''etichetta'' or ''protocollo'').

In the American colonies, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[George Washington]] wrote codes of conduct for young gentlemen. The immense popularity of advice columns and books by [[Letitia Baldrige]] and [[Judith Martin|Miss Manners]] shows the currency of this topic. Even more recently, the rise of the Internet has necessitated the adaptation of existing rules of conduct to create [[Netiquette]], which governs the drafting of e-mail, rules for participating in an online forum, and so on.

In Germany, many books dealing with etiquette, especially dining, dressing etc., are called ''the [[Knigge]]'', named after [[Adolph Freiherr Knigge]] who wrote the book ''Über den Umgang mit Menschen'' (''On Human Relations'') in the late 18th century. However, this book is about good manners and also about the social state of its time, but not about etiquette.

Etiquette may be wielded as a social weapon. The outward adoption of the superficial mannerisms of an in-group, in the interests of social advancement rather than a concern for others, is considered by many a form of [[snob]]bery, lacking in [[virtue]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1235">'''Eutrapelia''' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for '[[wittiness]]' (εὐτραπελία), referring to pleasantness in conversation.  It is one of [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[virtues]], the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|"golden mean"]] between boorishness (ἀγροικία) and buffoonery (βωμολοχία). Later on it came to mostly signify jokes that were obscene and coarse. The word appears only once in the [[New Testament]], in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:4 Ephesians 5:4], where it is translated "coarse jesting" in the [[NIV]].

An '''exclosure''', in an area being used extensively for grazing, is a limited area from which unwanted animals, for example browsing animals, such as domestic [[cattle]] or wildlife, such as [[deer]], are excluded by fencing or other means.  Exclosures are sometimes constructed by government agencies that manage livestock use on public lands—a practice in which private owners of cattle pay, though often only a nominal sum, for the right to graze their livestock on the public lands.

One purpose of the exclosure is to determine how the area would develop (in [[biodiversity]], vegetation height, [[ecology|ecological]] characteristics, etc.) if grazing were not conducted.

Another purpose is to demarcate an area safe for humans by excluding potentially deadly animals.  For example, a beach may have a shark net around it to prevent sharks from attacking human swimmers.  Another example is at wild animal preserves which provide fenced in areas for humans to safely watch lions, tigers, or other large predators.

The '''Ferrer Colony''' and the associated '''Ferrer Modern School''' was an [[anarchy|anarchist]] [[intentional community]]. It was founded in 1911 in [[Manhattan]] in New York City and in 1915 it moved to [[Piscataway, New Jersey]]. It lasted for more than 40 years before disbanding in 1953.

==History==
The colony was founded in 1911 in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. In 1915 it moved to [[Piscataway, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Followers of Spanish Anarchist Take Over School Site in Jersey.  |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/05/18/105545556.pdf |quote=Three hundred followers of Francisco Ferrer, the anarchist, who was put to death in Barcelona, Spain, on October 9, 1909, dedicated yesterday a Ferrer school ... |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 18, 1915 |accessdate=2009-05-16 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ferrer Modern School]] opened later.

Inhabitants were free to leave or join, with no questions asked. It gained a reputation for being a center of the [[free love]] movement, which drew in new inhabitants.&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

The colony purchased farmland for about $100 a plot. The plot was then sold to a community member for $150. By 1922, at their peak, 90 homes had been established. Some of the homes were only lived in during the weekend because people commuted to work in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

During the [[World War II]] the U.S. Government bought the surrounding land, and the buildings that were only occupied sporadically were subject to theft and vandalism.&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite book | author=[[David Wallechinsky]] |date=1975 | title = The Peoples Almanac | publisher = [[Doubleday &amp; Company]]|url=http://www.trivia-library.com/a/attempted-utopias-society-ferrer-colony-and-modern-school-part-2.htm |quote=&lt;!--Because of its anarchist philosophy the Ferrers did nothing to intrude on human relationships, whether those relationships were sanctioned by marriage, or not.

==Identity==
Flying monkeys can be anyone who believes the narcissist's [[false self|fake persona]] including the narcissist's spouse, child, friend, sibling or cousin.&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Bailey-Rug C (2016) It's Not You, It's Them: When People Are More Than Selfish&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Atkinson, flying monkeys are usually unwittingly [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] people who believe the [[Smear campaign|smears]] about the victim although they may be another narcissist working in tandem.&lt;ref name=Atkinson/&gt;

* the abuser's associates
* the victim's associates – manipulated to side with the abuser.
* authority and institutional figures – manipulated to side with the abuser.

==Tactics==
The flying monkey does the narcissist’s bidding to inflict additional torment to the target. It may consist of spying, spreading [[gossip]], threatening, painting the narcissist as the victim ([[victim playing]]) and the target as the perpetrator ([[victim blaming]]). Despite this, the narcissist does not hesitate to make flying monkeys his or her [[scapegoating|scapegoats]] when and if needed.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, J., [http://facesofnarcissism.com/2015/03/23/472/ Are you being used as a flying monkey for a narcissist?] 23 Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The flying monkeys may make it seem like the narcissist is not really involved. They are likely to have no idea that they are being used.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

Multiple flying monkeys are likely to act as a [[mobbing]] force against a victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flyingmonkeysdenied.com Flying Monkeys Denied] [[C-PTSD]] and Narcissistic Abuse Recovery Website&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[divorce]] conflicts, the children can be used by one party as a weapon against the other party.&lt;ref name=Vaknin/&gt;

The motives behind the narcissist's support group can be multiple. Service providers may be seduced by the [[Narcissistic charm|narcissist's charm]] into taking a one-sided perspective.&lt;ref&gt;S.

{{Liberalism sidebar |Ideas}}

The '''harm principle''' holds that the actions of [[individual]]s should only be limited to prevent [[harm]] to other individuals. [[John Stuart Mill]] articulated this principle in ''[[On Liberty]]'', where he argued that, "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."&lt;ref name="leeds1"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Freedom of Speech| work = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| publisher = | date = 17 April 2008| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/#HarPriFreSpe| accessdate = 10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An equivalent was earlier stated in France's ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' of 1789 as, "Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law."

== Definition ==
The belief "that no one should be forcibly prevented from acting in any way he chooses provided his acts are not invasive of the free acts of others" has become one of the basic principles of libertarian politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hamowy, ''The encyclopaedia of libertarianism'', Sage, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC p. xxi], ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase "harm principle" was not itself used until 1969{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}, the harm principle itself was first fully articulated by the English thinker [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873) in the first chapter of ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859),&lt;ref name="leeds1"/&gt; where he argued that:
{{Quotation|The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the [[liberty]] of action of any of their number, is self-protection. '''That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his [[will (philosophy)|will]], is to prevent harm to others.''' His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is [[sovereign individual|sovereign]].|[[John Stuart Mill]]|&lt;ref name="On Liberty"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCQCAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=on+liberty&amp;pg=PP1&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search?rlz=&amp;q=On+Liberty&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail#PPA21,M1 |author=John Stuart Mill|title=On Liberty|publisher=Oxford University|year=1859|pages=21–22|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even if a self-regarding action results in harm to oneself, it is still beyond the sphere of justifiable state coercion.

Harm itself is not a non-moral concept. The infliction of harm upon another person is what makes an action wrong.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitinture.com/documents/oliveira.pdf|last=Menezes Oliveira|first=Jorge|title=Harm and Offence in Mill’s Conception of Liberty|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=6 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harm can also result from a failure to meet an obligation. Morality generates obligations. Duty may be exacted from a person in the same way as a debt, and it is part of the notion of duty that a person may be rightfully compelled to fulfil it.&lt;ref name="On Liberty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliveira" /&gt;

== The offense principle ==

Mill's harm principle is distinct from the offense principle. The basis of comparison is that, in some cases, psychological or social harm may be comparable to physical harm. The difference is based on the assumption that offense may cause discomfort, but does not necessarily cause harm. Offense meets the harm principle only if it is a wrong and also causes harm.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The harm principle states that the only actions that can be prevented are ones that create harm. In other words, a person can do whatever he wants as long as his actions do not harm others. If a person's actions only affect himself, then society, which includes the government, should not be able to stop a person from doing what he wants. This even includes actions that a person may do that would harm the person himself.

However, we{{who|date=July 2018}} cannot just stop there and think that Mill makes things seem so simple, because he doesn't. If we were to stop our discussion of the harm principle at 'anyone can do whatever they want just so long as it doesn't affect anyone else,' problems arise. One such problem may be what to do with people who want to end their own life. Mill said it would not be okay for this to happen.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

For this to make the most sense, we need to understand three important ideas that helped shape the harm principle. The first is that the harm principle comes from another principle called the principle of utility.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The principle of utility states that people should only do those things that bring the greatest amount of happiness to the greatest number of people. So, if a person is trying to decide between two things, he should choose the option that makes the most people happy.

The second idea is that Mill says there is a difference between harm and offense.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Harm is something that would injure the rights of someone else or set back important interests that benefit others. An example of harm would be assaulting someone, causing them injury. An offense, according to Mill, is something that we would say 'hurt our feelings.'{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} These are less serious and should not be prevented, because what may hurt one person's feelings may not hurt another's, and so offenses are not universal.

The third idea to understand is that it is very rare for an action to only affect the individual himself. Mill argues that no person is truly isolated from others and that most actions do affect other people in important ways.

The ethical question as to what extent there should be constraints on [[free speech]] is often grounded in both the harm principle and the offense principle. If the exercise of free speech can be causally linked to violence or similar physical harm, it is constrained under the harm principle. Free speech actions such as burning a flag or holding controversial rallies usually fall under the offense principle instead, based on the corresponding question of what constitutes harm (or, alternately, weighing harm caused by limiting a freedom vs harm caused by the exercise of that freedom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/harm-principle-offense-principle-skokie-affair|title=Harm Principle, Offense Principle, and the Skokie Affair|last=Cohen-Almagor|first=Raphael|publisher=Political Studies|year=1993|volume=41|number=3|accessdate=6 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the abstract, criminalizing all wrongs that cause harm makes the offense principle almost synonymous with the harm principle.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} However, the definition of what constitutes a wrong may change over time—such that harm may be caused by actions that were not considered wrongs at the time, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Oliveira" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=E18D1EC7964F7D517E189DC596C451DF.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=118187|title=Rethinking the Offense Principle|last=Simester|first=A.P.|last2=von Hirsch|first2=Andrew|publisher=Legal Theory|year=2002|volume=8|accessdate=6 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Broader definitions of harm ==

In the same essay, Mill further explains the principle as a function of two maxims:

{{Quotation| The maxims are, first, that the individual is not accountable to society for his actions, in so far as these concern the interests of no person but himself. Advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people, if thought necessary by them for their own good, are the only measures by which society can justifiably express its dislike or disapprobation of his conduct. Secondly, that '''for such actions as are prejudicial to the interests of others, the individual is accountable, and may be subjected either to social or to legal punishments, if society is of opinion that the one or the other is requisite for its protection.''' (LV2)}}

The second of these maxims has become known as the social authority principle.&lt;ref name="Oliveira" /&gt;

However, the second maxim also opens the question of broader definitions of harm, up to and including harm to the society. The concept of harm is not limited to harm to another individual but can be harm to individuals plurally, without specific definition of those individuals.

This is an important principle for the purpose of determining harm that only manifests gradually over time—such that the resulting harm can be anticipated, but does not yet exist at the time that the action causing harm was taken. It also applies to other issues—which range from the right of an entity to discharge broadly polluting waste on private property, to broad questions of licensing, and even to the right of sedition.

== Modern examples ==
=== The harm principle in US libertarianism ===
The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|United States Libertarian Party]] includes a version of the harm principle as part of its official [[party platform]]. It states:
{{Quotation|Criminal laws should be limited in their application to violations of the rights of others through force or fraud, or to deliberate actions that place others involuntarily at significant risk of harm. Therefore, we favor the repeal of all laws creating “crimes” without victims . . .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/platform/|title=2016 Platform|publisher=Libertarian National Committee|year=2016|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Heteronomy''' refers to action that is influenced by a force outside the individual, in other words the state or condition of being ruled, governed, or under the sway of another, as in a military occupation. 

[[Immanuel Kant]], drawing on [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]],&lt;ref&gt; Rousseau, J.J. ([2010] 1754-1762). ''The Social Contract, A Discourse on the Origin of Inequality, and A Discourse on Political Economy.'' New York: Classic Books International.&lt;/ref&gt; considered such an action nonmoral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1/KSPglos.html Glossary of Kant's Technical Terms] by Stephen Palmquist&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912403176|title=Agency and autonomy in Kant's moral theory|last=Andrews.|first=Reath,|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=0199288828|location=|pages=36|oclc=912403176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the counter/opposite of [[autonomy]].

Philosopher [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] contrasted heteronomy with autonomy by noting that while all societies create their own institutions (laws, traditions and behaviors), autonomous societies are those in which their members are aware of this fact, and explicitly self-institute (αυτο-νομούνται). In contrast, the members of heteronomous societies (hetero = others) attribute their  [[imaginary (Sociology)|imaginaries]] to some extra-social authority (e.g., God, the state, ancestors, historical necessity, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castoriadis|first=Cornelius|date=1986-10-01|title=the nature and value of equality translated by david a. curtis|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/019145378601100404|journal=Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=373–390|doi=10.1177/019145378601100404|issn=0191-4537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hobbesian trap''' (or '''Schelling's dilemma''') is a theory that explains why [[preemptive strike]]s occur between two groups, out of bilateral fear of an imminent attack. Without outside influences this situation will lead to a fear spiral ([[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]], [[vicious circle]], [[Nash equilibrium]]) in which fear will lead to an [[arms race]] which in turn will lead to increasing fear. The Hobbesian trap can be explained in terms of [[game theory]]. Although cooperation would be the better outcome for both sides, mutual distrust leads to the adoption of strategies that have negative outcomes for individual players and all players combined.&lt;ref name="Baliga Sjöström"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baliga|first=Sandeep|author2=Tomas Sjöström|title=The Hobbesian Trap|date=2010-09-21|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/baliga/htm/hobbesiantrap.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been used to explain outbreaks of conflicts and violence, spanning from individuals to states.&lt;ref name="Pinker BAooN"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.|publisher=Penguin Group USA|isbn=978-0143122012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theory is most commonly associated with [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Thomas Schelling]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Examples==
[[Steven Pinker]] is a proponent of the theory of the Hobbesian trap and has applied the theory to many conflicts and outbreaks of violence between people, groups, tribes, societies and states.&lt;ref name="Pinker BAooN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinker TBS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature|year=2002|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0142003343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of gun control have been described as a Hobbesian trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danseconpolicy.blog.com/2012/12/16/the-gun-craze/ |title=The Gun Craze |last=Ocampo |first=Dan |date=December 16, 2012 |website= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419014702/http://danseconpolicy.blog.com/2012/12/16/the-gun-craze/ |archivedate=April 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example is the dilemma that both the armed burglar and the armed homeowner face when they meet each other. Neither side may want to shoot, but both are afraid of the other party shooting first so they may be inclined to fire pre-emptively, although the favorable outcome for both parties would be that nobody be shot.&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_10_29_nytbookreview.html|title = All About Evil.

Fear and mutual distrust between the actors increased the likelihood of a [[preemptive strike]].&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil" /&gt;

==Avoidance==
The Hobbesian trap can be avoided by influences that increase the trust between the two parties.&lt;ref name="Baliga Sjöström" /&gt; In the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], for example, [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Khrushchev]] realized that they were caught in a Hobbesian trap which helped them to make concessions that reduced distrust and fear.&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil" /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}
'''Matter''' is the substrate from which physical existence is derived, remaining more or less constant amid changes. The word "matter" is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''māteria'', meaning "wood", or “timber”, in the sense "material", as distinct from "mind" or "form".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "matter"&lt;/ref&gt; The image of wood came to Latin as a calque from the Greek philosophical usage of ''hyle'' (ὕλη).

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
In ancient [[Greek philosophy]], ''[[arche]]'' (ἀρχή) is the beginning or the first principle of the world. [[Thales of Miletus]] claimed that the first principle of all things is water. His theory was supported by the observation of moisture throughout the world and coincided with his theory that the earth floated on water.

Thales's theory was refuted by his pupil and successor, [[Anaximander]]. Anaximander noted that water could not be the arche because it could not give rise to its opposite, fire. Anaximander claimed that none of the elements (earth, fire, air, water) could be arche for the same reason. Instead, he proposed the existence of the [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]], an indefinite substance from which all things are born and to which all things will return.

[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], Anaximander's pupil, advanced yet another theory. He returns to the elemental theory, but this time posits air, rather than water, as the arche. Anaximenes suggests that all is made from air through either rarefication or condensation (thinning or thickening). Rarefied, air becomes fire; condensed, it becomes first wind, then cloud, water, earth, and stone in order.

[[Pythagoras of Samos]], a mathematician, mystic, and scientist, taught that number, rather than matter, constitutes the true nature of things. He seems to have influenced [[Socrates|Socrates']] [[ideal form]].

[[Heraclitus]] held that all is flux. In such a system there is no need for or possibility of matter.
[[Leucippus]] held that there exist indivisible particles, [[atoms]], underlying existence.

[[Empedocles]] held that there are [[Classical element|four elements]], from which things are derived, [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] and [[Air (classical element)|Air]]. Some added a fifth element, the [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], from which the heavens were derived. [[Socrates]] accepted (or at least did not reject) that list, as seen from [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], which identified the five elements with the [[Platonic solids]]. Earth was associated with the [[cube]], air with the [[octahedron]], water with the [[icosahedron]], fire with the [[tetrahedron]], and the heavens with the [[dodecahedron]].

[[Aristotle]], rejecting the atomic theory, instead analyzed the four terrestrial elements with the sense of touch:
* Air is primarily wet and secondarily hot.
* Fire is primarily hot and secondarily dry.
* Earth is primarily dry and secondarily cold.
* Water is primarily cold and secondarily wet.

He developed Socrates' ideal form into a theory which aimed to explain existence through the composition of matter and form. He conceived of matter as a passive possibility that something might be actualized by an active principle, a substantial form, giving it real existence. The theory of matter and form came to be known as [[Hylomorphism]].

Aristotle's ideas had little impact on the ancient world. The rise of [[Stoicism]] represented the return to earlier ideas. Their [[Categories (Stoic)|categories]] were an attempt to explain all existence without reference to anything [[incorporeal]].

[[Philo]] held that matter is the basis of evil.

[[Plotinus]] revived the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. 

==Medieval philosophy==
Many [[Christians]], such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], accepted Plotinus as the greatest of the [[pagan]] [[philosophers]]. Parts of Plotinus' ''[[Six Enneads]]'' were translated into [[Arabic]] as the ''[[Theology of Aristotle]]'', leading to a blossoming of Aristotle's philosophy in the [[Islamic]] world. This Islamic version of Aristotle eventually reached the [[University of Paris]] and the attention of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophy, and the work of [[Thomas Aquinas]].

==Modern science==
From a philosophical viewpoint, the term "matter" still is used to distinguish the material aspects of the universe from those of the spirit.&lt;ref name=Bergson&gt;{{cite book |title=Matter and Memory |chapter=Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9XAeb1mx6gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPR7,M1 |author=Henri Bergson| authorlink=Henri Bergson |isbn=0-486-43415-X |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=2004 |edition=Reprint of edition of 1904}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of modern [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] marked a return to the atomic theories of Leucippus.  [[Quantum physics]] and [[special relativity]] however, complicate the picture through the identification of matter and [[energy]], [[Elementary particle|particle]] and [[wave]].

The '''mature minor doctrine''' is an American term for the [[statutory]], [[regulatory]], or [[common law]] policy accepting that an [[emancipated minor|unemancipated minor]] [[patient]] may possess the [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]] to choose or reject a particular [[health care]] [[Therapy|treatment]], sometimes without the knowledge or agreement of parents, and should be permitted to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''West's encyclopedia of American law'', Volume 8, West Publishing, 1998, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; It is now generally considered a form of patients [[rights]]; formerly, the '''mature minor rule''' was largely seen as protecting [[health care providers]] from [[criminal]] and civil [[cause of action|claims]] by parents of minors at least 15.&lt;ref&gt;''Legal issues in pediatrics and adolescent medicine'' by Angela Roddey Holder, Yale University Press, 1985, page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions may [[codification (law)|codify]] an age of medical consent, accept the judgment of [[licensure|licensed]] providers regarding an individual minor, or accept a formal [[court decision]] following a request that a patient be designated a mature minor, or may rely on some combination. For example, patients at least 16 may be assumed to be mature minors for this purpose,&lt;ref&gt;"Definitions", ''USLegal.com'', [http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/mature-minor-doctrine/ Retrieved 2011-05-16], "Mature minor doctrine is a legal principle which... has been consistently applied in cases where the minor is sixteen years or older"&lt;/ref&gt; patients aged 13 to 15 may be designated so by licensed providers, and pre-teen patients may be so-designated after evaluation by an [[Government agency|agency]] or [[court]]. The mature minor doctrine is sometimes connected with enforcing [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|confidentiality]] of minor patients from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mature Minor Rule: Teens and patient confidentiality'', Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County, [http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/personal/famplan/providers/matureminor.aspx Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute==
In the United States, a typical statute lists: ''"Who may consent [or withhold consent for] surgical or medical treatment or procedures."''
:"...Any unemancipated minor of sufficient intelligence to understand and appreciate the consequences of the proposed surgical or medical treatment or procedures, for himself."&lt;ref&gt;''Mississippi Code'', [http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm Retrieved 2011-05-13] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720125628/http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''2010 Arkansas Code'', [http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-20/subtitle-2/chapter-9/subchapter-6/20-9-602/ Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical emancipation==
{{See also|Emancipation of minors}}
By definition, a "mature minor" has been found to have the [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] to make serious medical decisions alone. By contrast, "medical emancipation" formally releases children from some parental involvement requirements but does not necessarily grant that decision making to children themselves. Pursuant to statute, several jurisdictions grant medical emancipation to a minor who has become [[pregnant]] or requires [[reproductive health|sexual-health]] services, thereby permitting medical treatment without parental consent and, often, confidentiality from parents. A limited [[legal guardian|guardianship]] may be appointed to make medical decisions for the medically emancipated minor and the minor may not be permitted to refuse or even choose treatment.&lt;ref&gt;''Children and the Law'' by Douglas E. Abrams and Sarah H. Ramsey, West Group, 2003, page 769&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One early U.S. case of significance, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10967297783373086168&amp;q=431+P.2d+719.&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Smith v. Seibly''], 72 Wn.2d 16, 431 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 719 (1967), before the [[Washington Supreme Court]], establishes precedent on the mature minor doctrine. The plaintiff, Albert G. Smith, an 18-year-old married father, was suffering from [[myasthenia gravis]], a progressive disease. Because of this, Smith expressed concern that his wife might become burdened in caring for him for their existing child  and possibly for additional children. On March 9, 1961, while still 18, Smith requested a [[vasectomy]]. His doctor required [[Informed consent|written consent]], which Smith provided, and the [[surgery]] was performed. Later, after reaching Washington's statutory [[age of majority]], then 21, the doctor was sued by Smith, who now claimed that he had been a minor and thus unable to grant surgical or medical consent. The Court rejected Smith's argument: "Thus, age, intelligence, maturity, training, experience, economic independence or lack thereof, general conduct as an adult and freedom from the control of parents are all factors to be considered in such a case [involving consent to surgery]."

The court further quoted another recently decided case, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18043554202269328547&amp;q=422+P.2d+812&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Grannum v. Berard''], 70 Wn.2d 304, 307, 422 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 812 (1967): "The mental capacity necessary to consent to a surgical operation is a question of fact to be determined from the circumstances of each individual case." The court explicitly stated that a minor may grant surgical consent even without formal emancipation.

Especially since the 1970s, older pediatric patients sought to make autonomous decisions regarding their own treatment and sometimes sued successfully to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"Affirming the Decisions Adolescents Make about Life and Death" by Robert F. Weir and Charles Peters, ''Hastings Center Report'', Vol 27 No. 6, November–December 1997, Hastings Center, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; The decades of accumulated evidence tended to demonstrate that children are capable of participating in medical decision-making in a meaningful way;&lt;ref&gt;"Ethical problems in pediatric critical care: Consent" by Christine A. Zawistowski and Joel E. Frader, ''Critical Care Medicine'', Vol 31 Issue 5, May 2003, page S407-S410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mature Minors Should Have the Right to Refuse Life-Sustaining Medical Treatment" by Melinda T. Derish and Kathleen Vanden Heuvel, ''The Journal of Law Medicine and Ethics'', Vol 28 Issue 2, June 2000, pages 109-124&lt;/ref&gt; and legal and medical communities have demonstrated an increasing willingness of formally affirming decisions made by young people, even regarding life and death.&lt;ref&gt;"Children's Competence to Participate in Healthcare Decisions" by Susan M. Beidler and Susan B. Dickey, ''JONA's Healthcare Law Ethics and Regulation'', Vol 3 Issue 3, September 2001, page 80-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs have repeatedly influenced a patient's decision to choose treatment or not. In a case in 1989 in Illinois, [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/you-must-be-this-old-to-die/384303/ a 17 year old female Jehovah's Witness] was permitted to refuse necessary life saving treatments.

In 1990, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Patient Self-Determination Act]]; even though key provisions apply only to patients over age 18,&lt;ref&gt;''The Patient Self-Determination Act: An Early Look at Implementation'' by Mathy Mezey and Beth Latimer, ''Hastings Center Report'', January–February 1993, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; the legislation advanced patient involvement in decisionmaking. The [[West Virginia Supreme Court]], in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14842078072813819970&amp;q=422+SE2d+827&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Belcher v. Charleston Area Medical Center''], 422 [[South Eastern Reporter|S.E.2d]] 827, 188 W.Va. 105 (1992), defined a "mature minor" exception to [[parental consent]], according consideration to seven factors to be weighed regarding such a minor: age, ability, experience, education, exhibited judgment, conduct, and appreciation of relevant risks and consequences.&lt;ref&gt;"Mature Minors and Emancipated Minors", Health Sciences Center, West Virginia University, [http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf Retrieved 2011-08-04] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226055543/http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf |date=2011-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withholding of consent==
{{See also|Informed refusal}}

===United States===
In the United States, [[bodily integrity]] has long been considered a [[Natural and legal rights|common law right]]; the United States Supreme Court, in 1891's ''[[Union Pacific Railway Company v. Botsford]]'', found, "No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable [[Rational-legal authority|authority of law]]." The Supreme Court in 1990 (''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'') allowed that "constitutionally protected [[Claim rights and liberty rights|liberty interest]] in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred" in the ''[[Due process#The U.S. Constitution|Due Process]] Clause'' of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], but the Court refrained from explicitly establishing what would have been a newly enumerated right. Nevertheless, lower courts have increasingly held that competent patients have the right to refuse any treatment for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Towards the right to be killed?" by Trudo Lemmens, ''British Medical Bulletin'', Vol 52 No. 2, British Council, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] interpreted the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to have already adopted major aspects of mature minor doctrine, concluding,
:Although the United States Supreme Court has not broadened this constitutional right of minors beyond [[Abortion in the United States|abortion cases]], the [Illinois] [[appellate court]] found such an extension "inevitable." ...Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has not held that a [[Constitutional right|constitutionally based right]] to [[Informed refusal|refuse medical treatment]] exists, either for adults or minors. ...[U.S. Supreme Court] cases do show, however, that no "[[bright line]]" age restriction of 18 is tenable in restricting the rights of mature minors, [thus] mature minors may possess and exercise rights regarding medical care... If the evidence is clear and convincing that the minor is mature enough to appreciate the consequences of her actions, and that the minor is mature enough to exercise the judgment of an adult, then the mature minor doctrine affords her the common law right to consent to or refuse medical treatment [including life and death cases, with some considerations].&lt;ref&gt;''In re E.G.'', 549 [[North Eastern Reporter|N.E.2d]] 322, 133 Ill. 2d 98, Supreme Court of Illinois, November 13, 1989, [http://il.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19891113_0001777.IL.htm/qx Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing case of Z.M is being heard in Maryland regarding the minor's right to refuse chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.state.md.us/cosappeals/pdfs/201610schedule.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In Connecticut, Cassandra C. a seventeen year old was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to receive treatment. The court decided that Cassandra was not mature enough to make medical decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://campbelllawobserver.com/the-choice-is-not-always-yours-a-minors-right-to-make-medical-decisions/|title=The Choice is Not Always Yours: A Minor’s Right to Make Medical Decisions|newspaper=Campbell Law Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In 2009, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruling in ''[[A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)|A.C. v. Manitoba]]''&lt;!-- This article will be added; please do not "fix" redlink.---&gt; [2009] SCC 30 (CanLII) found that children ''may'' make life and death decisions about their medical treatment. In the majority opinion, [[Puisne Justice|Justice]] [[Rosalie Abella]] wrote:
:"The result of this [decision] is that young people under 16 will have the right to demonstrate mature medical decisional capacity. ...If, after a careful analysis of the young person’s ability to exercise mature and independent judgment, the court is persuaded that the necessary level of maturity exists, the young person’s views ought to be respected."
A "dissenting"&lt;ref&gt;That is, dissenting to the disposition of this specific case rather than the larger point of law&lt;/ref&gt; opinion by Justice [[Ian Binnie]] would have gone further:
:"At common law, proof of capacity entitles the “mature minor” to exercise personal autonomy in making medical treatment decisions free of parental or judicial control. ...[A] young person with capacity is entitled to make the treatment decision, not just to have ‘input’ into a [[judge]]’s consideration of what the judge believes to be the young person’s best interests."&lt;ref&gt;"A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)", Supreme Court of Canada, June 26, 2009, Docket 31955, [http://www.lewisday.ca/ldlf_files/pdf/AC.pdf Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;
Analysts note that the Canadian decision merely requires that younger patients be permitted a ''[[Hearing (law)|hearing]]'', and still allows a judge to "decide whether or not to order a medical procedure on an unwilling minor".&lt;ref&gt;"Charter Offers No Protection from Forced Blood Transfusion for Young Jehovah’s Witness" by Jim Young, Center for Constitutional Studies, July 2, 2009, [http://www.law.ualberta.ca/centres/ccs/news/?id=313 Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''modular process skid''' is a [[Process engineering|process system]] contained within a frame that allows the process system to be easily transported.  Individual skids can contain complete process systems and multiple process skids can be combined to create larger process systems or entire portable plants. They are sometimes called “a system in a box.” An example of a multi-skid process system might include a raw materials skid, a utilities skid and a processing unit which work in tandem.

Process skids are considered an alternative to traditional stick-built construction where process system parts are shipped individually and installed incrementally at the manufacturing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csidesigns.com/flowgeeks/what-is-a-skid-system/ |title=What Is a Skid System? &amp;#124; FlowGeeks |publisher=Csidesigns.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide the advantage of parallel construction, where process systems are built off-site in a fabrication facility while civil site upgrades are completed at the plant site simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicmodularprocess.com/blog/advantages-of-modular-process-design-infographic |title=Advantages of Modular Process Design Infographic |publisher=Epicmodularprocess.com |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skids are not always appropriate. If individual process parts are large and cannot reasonably be contained within the frame of a modular process skid, traditional construction methods are preferred.

==Skid design and layout==
Process skids are designed to contain a complete process system, a complete unit of operations or to organize a manufacturing process into logical units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proscon.com/solutions/modular.html |title=Modular Process Systems from |publisher=ProsCon |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; All skids have the following characteristics in common:
* '''Portable design'''– because they are self-contained units, built within frames, skid systems are easier to transport than traditional process systems. 
* '''Small footprint''' – process skid frames allow equipment layering. Piping, tanks, and necessary process equipment can be fit into a smaller footprint with a skid design
* '''Gathered process connections''' – process connections are gathered into one spot on the skid, making plant connections easier. In traditional process systems, connections are spread throughout the plant. 
* '''Controlled assembly''' – skids are typically built in controlled conditions offsite. Existing operations are not affected by skid fabrication. 
*[[Acceptance testing|'''FAT testing''']] before installation – Factory acceptance testing (FAT) can be completed before modular process skids are shipped to site. This reduces the amount of on-site startup time.
*'''Accessible layout''' – skids are designed for accessibility, usually including a center hallway, and major pieces of equipment placed around the edge of the frame.

==Modular process skid components==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3618">The '''moral high ground''', in ethical or political parlance, refers to the status of being respected for remaining moral, and adhering to and upholding a universally recognized standard of justice or goodness.
:"Parties seeking the moral high ground simply refuse to act in ways which are not viewed as legitimate and morally defensible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/treatment/moralhg.htm Moral High Ground] - International Online Training Program On Intractable Conflict - Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Holding the moral high ground can be used to legitimize [[political movements]], notably [[nonviolent resistance]], especially in the face of violent opposition,&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Johnson, ''Gandhi's Experiment with Truth'' (2006) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used by [[civil disobedience]] movements around the world to garner sympathy and support from society.

Similarly, 21st century states may refrain from declaring war in order to retain the moral high ground – though the cynic will observe that [[realpolitik]] still leads to wars being ''fought'', only without declarations.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Dinstein, ''War, Aggression and Self-Defence'' (2005) p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Economist and social critic [[Robert H. Frank]] challenged the idea that prosocial behavior was necessarily deleterious in business in his book ''What Price the Moral High Ground?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7602.html What Price the Moral High Ground: Ethical Dilemmas in Competitive Environments] - Robert H. Frank, {{ISBN|0-691-00672-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He argued that socially responsible firms often reap unexpected benefits even in highly competitive environments, because their commitment to principle makes them more attractive as partners to do business with.&lt;ref&gt;A. Teniati, ''The Collaborative Enterprise'' (2010) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everyday use==

In everyday use a person may take the perspective of the 'moral high ground' in order to produce a [[critique]] of something, or merely to win an argument. This perspective is sometimes associated to [[snobbery]] but may also be a legitimate way of taking up a stance.

Social sciences or philosophies are sometimes accused of taking the 'moral high ground' because they are often inherently interested in the project of human freedom and justice. The traditional project of education itself may be seen as defending a type of moral high ground from [[popular culture]], perhaps by using [[critical pedagogy]]: its proponents may themselves be accused (rightly or wrongly) of seeking a false and unjustified sense of superiority thereby.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''Tolkien'' (2001) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism==
Kate Fillion considered that in the wake of [[second-wave feminism]] "assumptions about female moral superiority pervade the public discourse", placing women as "comrades on the moral high ground, pitted against a common adversary who dwells in the shadowy depths far below".&lt;ref&gt;Kate Fillion, ''Lip Service'' (1997) p. 305 and p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Robert Lowell]] took the moral high ground, not once, but twice, with separate American presidents, in protesting US militarism.&lt;ref&gt;Seamus Heaney, '' Finders Keepers'' (2002) p. 205-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Mandelson]] considered that [[Tony Blair]] was "good at taking the high ground and throwing himself off it".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Simon Jenkins, ''Thatcher and Sons'' (2007) p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

'''One-alarm''', '''two-alarm''', '''three-alarm fires''', etc., are categories of [[Conflagration|fire]]s indicating the level of response by local authorities. The term '''multiple-alarm''' is a quick way of indicating that a fire is severe and is difficult to [[Fire containment|contain]]. This system of classification is common in the [[Firefighting in the United States|United States]] and in [[Canada]] {{cn|date=November 2018}} among both [[fire department]]s and news agencies.

==Definition==
A common misconception is that a "3-alarm fire," for example, means that three firehouses responded to the fire. This is not the rule behind the naming convention, although some cities may use the number of firehouses responding for multi-alarm designations because that is the simplest way to determine an alarm number.&lt;ref name="Rochester3alarm"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2015/01/27/firefighters-battle-blaze-behind-memorial-art-gallery/22389473/ |title=Demolition of building near MAG to continue Wednesday |last=MacIntyre-Yee|work=[[Democrat &amp; Chronicle]] |first=Tina |date=January 27, 2015 |accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engber"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engber|first1=Daniel|title=How Big Is a '10-Alarm Fire'?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/05/how_big_is_a_10alarm_fire.html|website=Slate|accessdate=15 November 2016|date=4 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely used formula for multi-alarm designation is based on the number of units ([[Fire apparatus|firetrucks]] for example) and [[firefighters]] responding to a fire; the more vehicles and firefighters responding, the higher the alarm designation. (Note: In most cities, a "unit" can be anything from a tanker or ladder truck to rescue vehicles to even cars driven by the chief and deputies.&lt;ref name="engber" /&gt;)

With this unit/firefighter alarm designation, the initial dispatch is referred to as a "first alarm" and is typically the largest. Subsequent alarms are calls for additional units, usually because the fire has grown and additional resources are needed to combat it, or that the incident is persisting long enough that firefighters on scene need to be relieved.&lt;ref name="nbc4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paying For Donated Blood, Ethanol In Lawn Mowers, Numbered Alarm Fires|url=http://www.nbc4.com/money/9208480/detail.html|website=NBC4.com|accessdate=15 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123185444/http://www.nbc4.com/money/9208480/detail.html|archivedate=23 November 2007|date=12 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requests for units and firefighters from outside jurisdictions do not normally occur in multi-firehouse urban areas until elevated alarms are reached (alarm three and above), but will depend on the location of the incident and the condition of the authority having jurisdiction at the time of the incident.

==History==
The system of classification comes from the old tradition of using [[Fire alarm box|pull stations]] to alert the local departments to a fire in their area.&lt;ref name="engber" /&gt; The "box" would send a message to all local stations by telegraph that there was a fire, indicating the location as a number: (station area)-(box number), e.g., 2-11.&lt;ref name="engber" /&gt; Fires are still dispatched as "box alarms," following this tradition, with maps broken up into a grid of "box areas."

==Typical alarm levels==
Below is a list of the alarm levels used in the response policy of the [[New York City Fire Department]]. This is a basic example of how alarm levels are categorized in a fire department, how many fire apparatus or fire units  respond to each alarm level, etc. In New York, however, additional special alarm levels are utilized, aside from the conventional 1st alarm, 2nd alarm, 3rd alarm, etc. Examples of such alarm levels are the signal 10-75 assignment, the signals 10-76 and 10-77 assignments, and the signal 10-60 assignment. A 10-75 is a working fire (i.e., there is fire visible from a building), the 10-76/10-77 assignments are the alarm levels separate from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd alarms, etc. that are the standard fire department responses to fires in high-rise buildings. The signal 10-60 is a separate response to major disasters. 

Below is how alarm levels are categorized in order per protocol. Each apparatus count is in an addition per alarm (a five alarm assignment has 21 engine companies total). Each total is the total number of units on scene. &lt;ref name="fdny"&gt;{{cite web|title=FDNY Dispatch Policy|url=http://www.fdnewyork.com/aa.asp|website=FDNewYork.com|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1st alarm assignment / Box alarm assignment:
*3 [[Fire Engine|engine]] companies
*2 [[Fire truck|ladder]] companies
*1 battalion chief

1st alarm assignment / All hands box alarm assignment:
*4 engine companies 
*3 ladder Companies  (operating as firefighter assist and search team)
*2 battalion chiefs (one as a [[Firefighter assist and search team|FAST]] unit) 
*1 [[Squad truck|squad]] company 
*1 rescue company 
*1 division chief

2nd alarm assignment:
*8 engine companies 
*5 ladder companies 
*5 battalion chiefs
*1 rescue Company
*1 squad Company 
*1 deputy chief
*1 RAC unit
*1 satellite
*safety battalion
*SOC battalion
*1 tactical support unit
*field comm
*field comm battalion
*communications unit

3rd alarm assignment:
*12 engine companies 
*7 ladder companies 
*6 battalion chiefs
*1 rescue Company 
*1 squad Company 
*1 deputy chief
*1 RAC unit
*1 satellite
*safety battalion
*SOC battalion
*1 tactical support unit
*field communications units
*field comm battalion
*communications unit
*mask service unit
*Air Recon Chief (on Brooklyn box)

4th alarm assignment:
*16 engine companies 
*9 ladder companies 
*6 battalion chiefs
*1 rescue Company 
*1 squad Company 
*1 deputy chief
*1 RAC unit
*1 satellite
*1 safety battalion
*SOC battalion
*1 tactical support unit
*field comm
*field comm battalion
*communications unit
*mobile command unit
*planning section chief
*Air Recon Chief (on Brooklyn box)

5th alarm assignment: 
*20 engine companies 
*11 ladder companies 
*6 battalion chiefs
*1 rescue Company 
*1 squad Company 
*1 deputy chief
*1 RAC unit
*1 satellite
*safety battalion
*SOC battalion
*1 tactical support unit
*field comm
*field comm battalion
*communications unit
*mobile command unit
*planning section chief
*Air Recon Chief (on Brooklyn box)

If the incident commander decides that the incident does not require a higher alarm level to be requested, they can specially request an additional unit to the scene without requesting a full alarm level assignment. For example, at a working fire, there are four engine companies, three ladder companies, one squad company, one rescue company, two battalion chiefs, and one division chief operating at the scene. If the fire is not large enough to require a 2nd alarm, but there is a need for more equipment and manpower, the commanding chief can request additional units to respond "specially called" to the scene.

Thus, at the scene of a 5th alarm fire in New York, there are a total of 20 engine companies, 11 ladder companies, one squad company, one rescue company, six battalion chiefs, one division chief, one deputy chief, one assistant chief, and the chief of operations, as well as multiple specialized units and or specially called units operating on the scene.

All of these companies come from many firehouses to the scene. Some companies, however, are quartered together at the same firehouses. So, it is not a matter of how many firehouses respond to a fire, as popularly believed, but rather, how many companies/units and how many firefighters are operating on scene.

{{Expand French|Mutilation|date=December 2014}}
'''Mutilation''' or '''maiming''' (from the Latin: ''mutilus'') is cutting off or injury to a body part of a person so that the part of the body is permanently damaged, detached or disfigured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Mutilation |volume=19 |pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Some ethnic groups practice ritual mutilation, e.g. [[scarification]], [[burn]]ing, [[flagellation]], [[tattooing]], or [[breaking wheel|wheeling]], as part of a [[rite of passage]]. In some cases, the term may apply to treatment of dead bodies, such as soldiers mutilated after they have been killed by an enemy.

The traditional Chinese practices of [[Slow slicing|''língchí'']] and [[foot binding]] are forms of mutilation. One form of mutilation that has captured the imagination of Westerners is the "long-neck" people, a sub-group of the [[Karen people|Karen]] known as the [[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] where women wear brass rings around their neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiangdao.com/chiangmai/karenlongneck.htm|title=Karen Long Neck hilltribe - Padaung, Northern Thailand|publisher=Chiangdao.com|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of [[tattoo]]ing is also considered a form of self-mutilation according to some cultural traditions, such as within Christianity. A joint statement released by the [[United Nations]] and numerous other international bodies opposes [[female genital mutilation|female circumcision]] as a form of mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Eliminating Female genital mutilation - An interagency statement | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | isbn = 978-92-4-159644-2 | url = http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/fgm/fgm_statement_2008.pdf | format = pdf | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not [[male circumcision]] amounts to mutilation is a subject of academic debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Denniston, G.

[[Castration]] is also a form of mutilation, as are [[body piercing]], some forms of extreme [[body modification]], and some [[cosmetic surgery]].

==Punishment==
''Maiming'', or mutilation which involves the loss of, or incapacity to use, a bodily member, is and has been practised by many societies with various cultural and religious significances, and is also a customary form of [[physical punishment]], especially applied on the principle of [[an eye for an eye]].

The [[mapuche|Araucanian]] warrior [[Galvarino]] suffered this punishment as a prisoner during the Spanish [[conquest of Chile]].

In law, maiming is a criminal offence; the old law term for a special case of maiming of persons was [[Mayhem (crime)|mayhem]], an [[Anglo]]-[[French language|French]] variant form of the word.

Maiming of animals by others than their owners is a particular form of the offence generally grouped as malicious damage. For the purpose of the law as to this offence animals are divided into cattle, which includes horses, pigs and asses, and other animals which are either subjects of larceny at common [[law]] or are usually kept in confinement or for domestic purposes.

In Britain under the [[Malicious Damage Act 1861]] the punishment for maiming of cattle was three to fourteen years penal servitude; malicious injury to other animals is a misdemeanour punishable on summary conviction. For a second offence the penalty is imprisonment with hard labor for over twelve months.  Maiming of animals by their owner falls under the Cruelty to Animals Acts.

==Mutilation as human punishment== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dock]] --&gt;
In times when even judicial [[physical punishment]] was still commonly allowed to cause not only intense pain and [[public humiliation]] during the administration but also to inflict permanent physical damage, or even deliberately intended to mark the criminal for life by [[docking (animal)|docking]] or [[human branding|branding]], one of the common anatomical target areas not normally under permanent cover of clothing (so particularly merciless in the long term) were the ear(s).
[[File:Un pauvre averti Gontran - Frédégonde ordonne la mutilation d'Olericus.jpg|thumb|[[Fredegund]] ordering the mutilation of Olericus.]]
In England, for example, various pamphleteers attacking the religious views of the Anglican episcopacy under [[William Laud]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], had their ears cut off for those writings: in 1630 Dr. [[Alexander Leighton]] and in 1637 still other [[Puritans]], [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (puritan)|Henry Burton]] and [[William Prynne]].

In Scotland one of the [[Covenanters]], James Gavin of [[Douglas, Lanarkshire]], had his ears cut off for refusing to renounce his religious faith. In Japan, [[Gonsalo Garcia]] and his companions were similarly punished.

Notably in various jurisdictions of colonial British North America, even relatively minor crimes, such as hog stealing, were punishable by having one's ears nailed to the [[pillory]] and slit loose, or even [[cropping (punishment)|cropped]], a [[counterfeiter]] would be branded on top (for that crime, considered [[lèse-majesté]], the older [[mirror punishment]] was boiling in oil), which was an example of western mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;Garraty, John A. (2003) Historical Viewpoints. New York City, New York: Addison Wesley Longman, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence did not render American justice any less brutal. For example, in the future state of Tennessee, an example of harsh 'frontier law' under the 1780 [[Cumberland Compact]] took place in 1793 when Judge [[John McNairy]] sentenced Nashville's first horse thief, John McKain, Jr., to be fastened to a wooden stock one hour for 39 lashes, have his ears cut off and cheeks [[branding persons|branded]] with the letters "H" and "T".

[[Tongue cutting]] is also a form of mutilation as this leads to bleeding to death in most cases with choking in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/pun.html|title=A History of Punishments|publisher=Localhistories.org|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nebahne Yohannes]], an unsuccessful claimant to the [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Ethiopian imperial throne]] who had his ears and nose cut off, yet was then freed. This form of mutilation against unsuccessful claimants to thrones has been in use in middle-eastern regions for thousands of years. To qualify as a king, formerly, one had to exemplify perfection. Obvious physical deformities such as missing noses, ears, or lips, are thereby sufficient disqualifications. The victim in these cases is typically freed alive to act (''a'') as an example to others, and (''b'') as no longer a threat.

==Education==
Nabawiya Mohamed Musa Badawia, the inspiring [[Zagazig]]i fallahi woman that had strong nationalism and feminism ideas as a young-woman, she stood for the rights of her nation and fellow [[Egyptians|Egyptian women]]. Nabawiya's dad was an [[Army Officer|Egyptian officer]] who once went to a mission to [[Sudan]] and had never came back.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.marefa.org/نبوية_موسى|title=''Nabawiya Musa- Full biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.albawabhnews.com/2979355|title=''Nabawiyya Mohamed Musa Badawia نبوية موسى..

In 1923, she and two of her fellow activists, Cesa Nabarawi and Nabawiya Moussa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nabawiyya Musa was one of the first and last women to complete the education exam and be accepted into the Saniyya School under [[Colonialism|colonial rule]] because of their [who?] fear of women becoming too powerful ina society led by men. In her childhood her brother helped her learn to read and write at home; while she taught herself Math principles. By the time she turned thirteen she was keen on continuing her school education but her family refused, thus defying the established social norms of the time she stole her mother's stamp and sold her gold bracelet to apply for school and went on with her studies secretly against her family's wishes.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

She finished her High School education in 1907 to become the first girl ever to finish high school in Egypt. In 1908 she finished her degree in education and went on to be a prominent educator for the middle-class and an advocate for [[Feminism|women’s rights]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; It was not until after 1922 that more women were let into the newly established Egyptian University and by this time Nabawiyya Musa was a key lecturer and leader among her colleagues.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Nabawiyya musa is famous because she was the first Egyption woman to go to high school.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Career==
Nabawiyya Musa was an avid writer and educator who gave lectures around Egypt advocating for the education of women. She believed strongly that educated women would only improve the state by being able to be independent, bring in money for the household as middle-class women and/or raise their children to be independent so they could grow up to be assets to society.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arab"/&gt; She believed strongly that the lack of hierarchy in the peasant and [[Social class|lower classes]] was actually a good model of how women can be an asset to work and [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] with men. She also believed that the differences between men and women were nothing but a social construct and could easily be broken with time. Through giving women and education she sought to end [[Rape|sexual violence]] against women. She believed that by giving women an equal status in the workforce and in education would make them less vulnerable and less prone to sexual violence.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arab"/&gt;

==The Feminist Movement==
Nabawiyya Musa was an integral part in the [[feminist movement]] in Egypt. She stood out because many of her views echoed very strong [[Egyptian Nationalism]] as well as equal opportunities for women. Along with highlighting the education of women, she was also a leading [[role model]] in breaking down the social constructs of women. She and her partners in the feminist movement believed that a radical call for unveiling of women was not needed in the beginning of the movement because Egypt was not ready to accept it. However, after attending a conference in Rome in 1923, she along with [[Huda Shaarawi]] and [[Ceza Nabarawi]] came back to Egypt unveiled as a proclamation to Egyptian society.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Death==
Musa died on April 30, 1951.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

'''National identity''' is a person's identity or sense of belonging to one state or to one [[nation]].&lt;ref name=":24"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Social Identity Theory of Inter-group Behavior |last=Tajfel |first=Henri |date = 1986|journal = Psychology of Intergroup Relations &lt;!-- Please identify correct journal/publication --&gt;|doi = |pmid = |last2=Turner|first2=John C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the sense of a nation as a cohesive whole, as represented by distinctive traditions, culture, language and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/national-identity|title =Definition of National Identity in English|date =|accessdate =|website =Oxford Dictionaries|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20151117063449/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/national-identity|archivedate =2015-11-17|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; National identity may refer to the subjective feeling one shares with a group of people about a nation, regardless of one's legal citizenship status.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1354-5078.2004.00159.x/abstract|title = Anothony D.

As a collective phenomenon, national identity can arise as a direct result of the presence of elements from the "common points" in people's daily lives: [[national symbol]]s, language, the nation's history, [[national consciousness]], and cultural artefacts.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

The expression of one's national identity seen in a positive light is [[patriotism]] which is characterized by national pride and positive emotion of love for one's country. The extreme expression of national identity is [[chauvinism]], which refers to the firm belief in the country's superiority and extreme loyalty toward one's country.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite book|title = Social Identity, Intergroup Conflict, and Conflict Reduction |editor-last=Ashmore |editor-first=Richard D. |editor-last2=Jussim |editor-first2=Lee |editor-last3=Wilder |editor-first3=David |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |isbn=9780195137439 |pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation of national identity ==
[[File:Norwegian National Day in Svolvaer.jpg|thumb|Norwegians celebrating national day]]
National identity is not an inborn trait and it is essentially socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Imagined Communities: reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism |last=Anderson|first=Benedict |publisher=Verso |year=1991 |isbn= 9780860915461 |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person's national identity results directly from the presence of elements from the "common points" in people's daily lives: [[national symbol]]s, [[National language|language]], [[National colours|colors]], nation's history, blood ties, [[culture]], [[music]], cuisine, radio, television, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Tales and National Identity: An introduction to narrative social psychology |last=László |first=János |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=9780415704700 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title = Patriotism in the Lives of Individuals and Nations|last = Bar-Tal|first = Daniel|publisher = Nelson-Hall Publishers|year = 1997|isbn = 083041410X|location = Chicago|pages = 171–172|last2 = Staub|first2 = Ervin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under various social influences, people incorporate national identity into their personal identities by adopting beliefs, values, assumptions and expectations which align with one’s national identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People with identification of their nation view national beliefs and values as personally meaningful, and translate these beliefs and values into daily practices.&lt;ref name=":24"/&gt;

=== Conceptualization ===
Political scientist [[Rupert Emerson]] defined national identity as "a body of people who feel that they are a nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = From Empire to Nation|last = Emerson|first = Rupert|publisher = Beacon Press|year = 1960|isbn = |location = Boston, MA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of national identity was endorsed by social psychologist, [[Henri Tajfel]], who formulated social identity theory together with John Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Social Identity Approach in Social Psychology|last = Reicher|first = Stephen|publisher = The SAGE handbook of identities|year = 2010|isbn = 1446248372|location = London|pages = |last2 = Spears|first2 = Russell|last3 = Haslam|first3 = Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social identity theory]] adopts this definition of national identity, and suggests that the conceptualization of national identity includes both self-categorization and affect. Self-categorization refers to identifying with a nation and viewing oneself as a member of a nation. The affect part refers to the emotion a person has with this identification, such as a sense of belonging, or emotional attachment toward one's nation.&lt;ref name=":34"/&gt; The mere awareness of belonging to a certain group invokes positive emotions about the group, and leads to a tendency to act on behalf of that group, even when the other group members are sometimes personally unknown.&lt;ref name=":34"/&gt;

National identity requires the process of self-categorization and it involves both the identification of [[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] (identifying with one's nation), and differentiation of [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (other nations). By recognizing commonalities such as having common descent and common destiny, people identify with a nation and form an in-group, and at the same time they view people that identify with a different nation as out-groups.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{cite book|title = National Identity|last = Smith|first = Anthony|publisher = University of Nevada Press|year = 1991|isbn = 0874172047|location = |pages = 8–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social identity theory suggests a positive relationship between identification of a nation and derogation of other nations. By identifying with one's nation, people involve in intergroup comparisons, and tend to derogate out-groups.&lt;ref name=":34"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Social Identity Context, Commimtment, Content. Some Current Issues in Research on Social Identity and Self-categorization Theories|last = Turner|first = J.C|publisher = Oxford: Blackwell|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several studies have investigated this relationship between national identity and derogating other countries, and found that identifying with national identity does not necessarily result in out-group derogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Commentary. National Identity: Pride and prejudice?|last = Hopkins|first = Nick|date = 2001|journal = British Journal of Social Psychology|doi = 10.1348/014466601164795|volume=40|pages=183–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National identity, like other social identities, engenders positive emotions such as pride and love to one's nation, and feeling of obligations toward other citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Differentiation between Social Groups: studies in the social psychology of intergroup relations|last = Tajfel|first = Henri|publisher = Academic Press|year = 1978|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The socialization of national identity, such as socializing national pride and a sense of the country's exceptionalism contributes to harmony among ethnic groups. For example, in the U.S, by integrating diverse ethnic groups in the overarching identity of being an American, people are united by a shared emotion of national pride and the feeling of belonging to the U.S, and thus tend to mitigate ethnic conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Ethnic Groups in Conflict|last = Horowitz|first = Donald|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1985|isbn = 0520053850|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salience ===
National identity can be most noticeable when the nation confronts external or internal enemy&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; and natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://jos.sagepub.com/content/33/2/205.short|title = Natural Disasters and National Identity: time, space, and mythology|last = West|first = Brad|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Sociology|doi = 10.1177/144078339703300205|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Smith|first2 = Philip|volume=33|pages=205–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this phenomenon is the rise in patriotism and national identity in the U.S after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8410977/ns/us_news/t/poll-us-patriotism-continues-soar/#.VklaYXarTIU|title = Poll: U.S. Patriotism Continues to Soar|last = Ross|first = Michael|date = Jul 4, 2005|work = NBC News|access-date = |via = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031133/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8410977/ns/us_news/t/poll-us-patriotism-continues-soar/#.VklaYXarTIU|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grant-lyon/patriotism-versus-nationa_b_953251.html|title = Patriotism vs. Nationalism in a Post 9/11 World|last = Lyon|first = Grant|date = Sep 8, 2011|work = Huffington Post|access-date = |via = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117020339/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grant-lyon/patriotism-versus-nationa_b_953251.html|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The identity of being an American is salient after the terrorist attacks and American national identity is evoked.&lt;ref name=":24"/&gt; Having a common threat or having a common goal unite people in a nation and enhance national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = National Identity: Pragmatic Solutions for Democratic Governance in African Nations|last = Uko-Ima|first = Barrister|publisher = Xlibris LLC|year = 2014|isbn = 9781499047950|location = |pages = 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Sociologist Anthony Smith argues that national identity has the feature of continuity that can transmit and persist through generations. By expressing the myths of having common descent and common destiny, people's sense of belonging to a nation is enhanced.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; However, national identities can disappear across time as more people live in foreign countries for a longer time, and can be challenged by supranational identities, which refers to identifying with a more inclusive, larger group that includes people from multiple nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Advances in Psychological Science: social, personal, and cultural aspects|last = Adair|first = John|publisher = Psychology Press|year = 1998|isbn = 0863774709|location = |pages = 250–251|last2 = Belanger|first2 = David|first3 = Kenneth|last3 = Dion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National identity as a collective phenomenon ==
{{See also|National consciousness}}
[[File:Patriotism (4662136678).jpg|thumb|American flag as a [[national symbol]]]]

National identity can be thought as a collective product.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Through socialization, a system of beliefs, values, assumptions and expectations is transmitted to group members.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; The collective elements of national identity may include national symbols, traditions, and memories of national experiences and achievements. These collective elements are rooted in the nation's history. Depending on how much the individual is exposed to the socialization of this system, people incorporate national identity to their personal identity to different degrees and in different ways, and the collective elements of national identity may become important parts of individual's definition of the self and how they view the world and their own place in it.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|title = Nationalism, Patriotism and National Identity: Social-Psychological Dimensions|last = Kelman|first = Herbert|publisher = Nelson-Hall Publishers|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = 171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges  ==

=== Ethnic Identity  ===
[[File:Australiadayprotest.jpg|thumb|Aboriginal groups protesting in Brisbane, Australia]]
In countries that have multiple ethnic groups, ethnic identity and national identity may be in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14662043.2011.564469|title = Ethno-national conflict and its management|last = Woods|first = Eric|date = 2011|journal = Commonwealth &amp; Comparative Politics|doi = 10.1080/14662043.2011.564469|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Schertzer|first2 = Robert|last3 = Kaufmann|first3 = Eric|volume=49|pages=153–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conflicts are usually referred to as ethno-national conflict. One of the famous ethno-national conflicts is the struggle between the [[Multiculturalism in Australia|Australian]] government and [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal population in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-September-1998/batty.html|title = Saluting the dot-spangled banner: Aboriginal culture, national identity and the Australian republic|last = Batty|first = Philip|date = 1997|journal = Australian Humanities Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112914/http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-September-1998/batty.html|archivedate = 2016-03-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government and majority culture imposed policies and framework that supported the majority, European-based cultural values and a national language as English. The aboriginal cultures and languages were not supported by the state, and were nearly eradicated by the state during the 20th century. Because of these conflicts, aboriginal population identify less or do not identify with the national identity of being an Australian, but their ethnic identities are salient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2000/howard2000a.pdf|title = Social Psychology of Identities|last = Howard|first = Judith|date = 2000|journal = Annual Review of Sociology|doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.367 |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305014447/http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2000/howard2000a.pdf|archivedate = 2016-03-05|df =|volume=26|pages=367–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===
As immigration increases, many countries face the challenges of constructing national identity and accommodating immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor = 20097447|title = Immigration and National Identity: Constructing the Nation|last = Doty|first = Roxanne|date = 1996|journal = Review of International Studies|doi = 10.1017/s0260210500118534|pmid =|volume=22|pages=235–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries are more inclusive in terms of encouraging immigrants to develop a sense of belonging to their host country. For example, [[Multiculturalism in Canada|Canada]] has the highest permanent immigration rates in the world. The Canadian government encourages immigrants to build a sense of belonging to Canada, and has fostered a more inclusive concept of national identity which includes both people born in Canada and immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Social Psychology of Social Problems: The intergroup context|last = de Zavala|first = Agnieszka|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2012|isbn = 1137272228|location = |pages = 102–104|last2 = Cichocka|first2 = Aleksandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries are less inclusive. For example, Russia has experienced two major waves of immigration influx, one in the 1990s, and the other one after 1998. Immigrants were perceived negatively by the Russian people and were viewed as "unwelcome and abusive guests." Immigrants were considered outsiders and were excluded from sharing the national identity of belonging to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/national-identity-through-the-prism-immigration-the-case-study-modern-russia|title = National Identity through the Prism of Immigration: The Case Study of Modern Russia|date = Jul 7, 2011|accessdate = |website = Kennan Institute|publisher = |last = Liedy|first = Amy|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024925/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/national-identity-through-the-prism-immigration-the-case-study-modern-russia|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, national identity collides with a person's civil identity.

'''Neuroscience of sex differences''' is the study of understanding the characteristics of the brain that separate the male brain and the female brain.  Psychological sex differences are thought by some to reflect the interaction of genes, hormones and social learning on brain development throughout the lifespan.

Some evidence from brain morphology and function studies indicates that male and female brains cannot always be assumed to be identical from either a structural or functional perspective, and some brain structures are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]].&lt;ref name="Cahill"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

__TOC__

==History==
Ideas of differences in the male and female brain circulated during the time of ancient Greek philosophers around 850 B.C. [[Aristotle]] claimed that males did not "receive their soul" until 40 days post-gestation and females did not until 80 days. In 1854, [[Emil Huschke]] discovered that "the [[frontal lobe]] in the male is all of 1%  larger than that of the female."&lt;ref name=Swaab&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Swaab DF, Hofman MA |title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain. A historical perspective |volume=61 |issue= |pages=361–74 |year=1984 |pmid=6396708 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(08)64447-7|series=Progress in Brain Research |isbn=9780444805324 |chapter=Sexual Differentiation of the Human Brain a Historical Perspective }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 19th century progressed, scientists began researching sexual dimorphisms in the brain significantly more.&lt;ref name=Swaab2&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hofman MA, Swaab DF |title=Sexual dimorphism of the human brain: myth and reality |journal=Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=161–70 |year=1991 |pmid=1778230 |doi=10.1055/s-0029-1211113|url=https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/files/490079/14938_285_swaab.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until around 21 years ago, scientists knew of several structural sexual dimorphisms of the brain, but they did not think that sex had any impact on how the human brain performs daily tasks. Through molecular, animal, and neuroimaging studies, a great deal of information regarding the differences between male and female brains and how much they differ in regards to both structure and function has been uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Margaret M.|date=2016-02-19|title=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences: 371 (1688)|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1688|journal=Phil.

==Evolutionary explanations==

===Sexual selection===
Females show enhanced information recall compared to males. This may be due to the fact that females have a more intricate evaluation of risk-scenario contemplation, based on a prefrontal cortical control of the amygdala.  For example, the ability to recall information better than males most likely originated from sexual selective pressures on females during competition with other females in mate selection. Recognition of social cues was an advantageous characteristic because it ultimately maximized offspring and was therefore selected for during evolution.&lt;ref name="Cahill"/&gt;

[[Oxytocin]] is a hormone that induces contraction of the uterus and lactation in mammals. It is also a characteristic hormone of nursing mothers. Studies have found that oxytocin improves spatial memory. Through activation of the [[MAP kinase]] pathway, oxytocin plays a role in the enhancement of long-term synaptic plasticity, which is a change in strength between two neurons over a synapse that lasts for minutes or longer, and long-term memory. This hormone may have helped mothers remember the location of distant food sources so they could better nurture their offspring.&lt;ref name="Cahill"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cahill L |title=Why sex matters for neuroscience |journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=477–84 |date=June 2006  |pmid=16688123 |doi=10.1038/nrn1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male vs. female brain anatomy==

===Hemisphere differences===
A popular theory regarding language functions suggests that women use both hemispheres more equally, whereas men are more strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere; however a 2008 meta-analysis of 29 studies comparing language lateralization in males and females found no overall difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sommer IE, Aleman A, Somers M, Boks MP, Kahn RS |title=Sex differences in handedness, asymmetry of the planum temporale and functional language lateralization |journal=Brain Research |volume=1206 |issue= |pages=76–88 |date=April 2008  |pmid=18359009 |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2008.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amygdala===
[[File:Amygdala small.gif|thumb|alt=image of Amygdala| The amygdala (red) in a human brain.]]
A 2016 meta-analysis found that the amygdala is not significantly larger in either sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marwha|first=Dhruv|last2=Halari|first2=Meha|last3=Eliot|first3=Lise|date=2017-02-15|title=Meta-analysis reveals a lack of sexual dimorphism in human amygdala volume|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916307431|journal=NeuroImage|volume=147|pages=282–294|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.12.021|pmid=27956206}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 meta-analysis of [[fMRI]] studies of amygdala activation found larger effect sizes in men compared with women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sergerie |first1=K |last2=Chochol |first2=C |last3=Armony |first3=JL |title=The role of the amygdala in emotional processing: a quantitative meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies. |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2008 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=811–30 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.12.002 |pmid=18316124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amygdala volume correlates positively with fearfulness in girls but not in boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In fMRI studies, women display stronger activation in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex than men.&lt;ref name=Homberg2017/&gt;

===Hippocampus===
A 2016 meta-analysis found that the hippocampus does not differ in volume between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tan |first1=A |last2=Ma |first2=W |last3=Vira |first3=A |last4=Marwha |first4=D |last5=Eliot |first5=L |title=The human hippocampus is not sexually-dimorphic: Meta-analysis of structural MRI volumes. |journal=NeuroImage |date=1 January 2016 |volume=124 |issue=Pt A |pages=350–366 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.08.050 |pmid=26334947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other regions and not region-specific===

There are sex differences in [[locus coeruleus]] dendritic structure that allow for an increased reception and processing of limbic information in females compared to males.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kret |first1=ME |last2=De Gelder |first2=B |title=A review on sex differences in processing emotional signals. |journal=Neuropsychologia |date=June 2012 |volume=50 |issue=7 |pages=1211–21 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.12.022 |pmid=22245006|url=http://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/a-review-on-sex-differences-in-processing-emotional-signals(3aea49a9-7521-4aae-863d-6f351a012b88).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressive and defiant behavior is also associated with decreased right [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) volume in boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===White/grey matter===
In a 2013 meta-analysis, researchers found on average males had larger [[grey matter]] (GM) volume in bilateral [[amygdala]]e, [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]], anterior [[Parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal gyri]], [[Cingulate cortex|posterior cingulate gyri]], [[precuneus]], [[putamen]] and [[Temporal lobe|temporal]] poles, areas in the left posterior and [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate gyri]], and areas in the [[cerebellum]] bilateral VIIb, VIIIa and Crus I lobes, left VI and right Crus II lobes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A meta-analysis of sex differences in human brain structure|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413003011|journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|date = 2014-02-01|pmc = 3969295|pmid = 24374381|pages = 34–50|volume = 39|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.12.004|first = Amber N.

== Brain networks ==
A 2014 meta-analysis found that although men and women commonly used the same brain networks for [[working memory]], specific regions were sex specific.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://brainmap.org/pubs/Hill_BP_14.pdf|title = Gender differences in working memory networks: A BrainMap meta-analysis|last = Hill|first = Ashley C.|date = 2014|journal = Biological Psychology|doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2014.06.008|pmid = 25042764|pmc = 4157091|access-date =|volume=102|pages=18–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both men and women's active [[working memory]] networks composed of bilateral [[Brodmann area 46|middle frontal gyri]], left [[Cingulate cortex|cingulate gyrus]], right [[precuneus]], left [[Inferior parietal lobule|inferior]] and [[Parietal lobe|superior parietal lobes]], right [[claustrum]], and left middle [[Temporal lobe|temporal gyrus]] but women also tended have consistent activity in the [[Limbic system|limbic]] regions such as the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]], bilateral [[amygdala]] and right [[hippocampus]] while men tended to have a distributed networks spread out among the [[cerebellum]], portions of the superior [[parietal lobe]], the left [[Insular cortex|insula]] and bilateral [[thalamus]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A 2017 review from the perspective of [[large-scale brain networks]], hypothesized that women's higher susceptibility to stress-prone diseases like PTSD and major depressive disorder, in which the [[salience network]] is theorized to be overactive and to interfere with the [[Executive functions|executive control network]], may be due in part (along with societal exposure to stressors and the coping strategies that are available to women) to underlying sex-based brain differences.&lt;ref name=Homberg2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Homberg |first1=Judith R |last2=Kozicz |first2=Tamas |last3=Fernández |first3=Guillén |title=Large-scale network balances in the transition from adaptive to maladaptive stress responses |journal=Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences |date=April 2017 |volume=14 |pages=27–32 |doi=10.1016/j.cobeha.2016.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurochemical differences==

===Hormones===
[[Steroid hormones]] have several effects on brain development as well as maintenance of [[homeostasis]] throughout adulthood. One effect they exhibit is on the [[hypothalamus]], where they increase [[synapse]] formation.&lt;ref name= "Simerly"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simerly RB |title=Wired on hormones: endocrine regulation of hypothalamic development |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=81–5 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15721748 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2005.01.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrogen receptors have been found in the [[hypothalamus]], [[pituitary gland]], [[hippocampus]], and [[frontal cortex]], indicating the estrogen plays a role in brain development.  [[Gonadal hormone]] receptors have also been found in the basal fore-brain nuclei.&lt;ref name="Genazzani"/&gt;

====Estrogen and the female brain====
[[Estradiol]] influences cognitive function, specifically by enhancing learning and memory in a dose-sensitive manner.  Too much [[estrogen]] can have negative effects by weakening performance of learned tasks as well as hindering performance of memory tasks; this can result in females exhibiting poorer performance of such tasks when compared to males.&lt;ref name="Korol"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Korol DL |title=Role of estrogen in balancing contributions from multiple memory systems |journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=309–23 |date=November 2004  |pmid=15464412 |doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2004.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that during development, estrogen can exhibit both feminizing and defeminizing effects on the human brain; high levels of estrogen induce male neural traits to develop while moderate levels induce female traits.  In females, defeminizing effects are resisted because of the presence of [[α-fetoprotein]] (AFP), a carrier protein proposed to transport estrogen into brain cells, allowing the female brain to properly develop. The role of AFP is significant at crucial stages of development, however. Prenatally, AFP blocks estrogen. Postnatally, AFP decreases to ineffective levels; therefore, it is probable that estrogen exhibits its effects on female brain development postnatally.&lt;ref name="Bakker"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bakker J, Baum MJ |title=Role for estradiol in female-typical brain and behavioral sexual differentiation |journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |date=January 2008  |pmid=17720235 |pmc=2373265 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2007.06.001|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/91356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ovariectomies, surgeries inducing [[menopause]], or natural menopause cause fluctuating and decreased [[estrogen]] levels in women. This in turn can "attenuate the effects" of endogenous opioid peptides. [[Opioid peptide]]s are known to play a role in emotion and motivation. [[β-endorphin]] (β-EP), an endogenous [[opioid peptide]], content has been found to decrease (in varying amounts/brain region), post [[ovariectomy]], in female rats within the [[hypothalamus]], [[hippocampus]], and [[pituitary gland]]. Such a change in β-EP levels could be the cause of mood swings, behavioral disturbances, and hot flashes in post menopausal women.&lt;ref name= "Genazzani"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Genazzani AR, Pluchino N, Luisi S, Luisi M |title=Estrogen, cognition and female ageing |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=175–87 |year=2007 |pmid=17135285 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dml042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Testosterone and the male brain====
[[Testosterone]] heavily influences male development; a study found that perinatal females introduced to elevated testosterone levels exhibited male behavior patterns. In the absence of testosterone, female behavior is retained.&lt;ref name="Simerly"/&gt;
Testosterone's influence on the brain is caused by organizational developmental effects. It has been shown to influence proaptotic proteins so that they increase neuronal cell death in certain brain regions.  Another way testosterone affects brain development is by aiding in the construction of the "limbic hypothalamic neural networks".&lt;ref name="Simerly"/&gt;

==Cognitive tasks==
It was once thought that sex differences in cognitive task and problem solving did not occur until puberty. However, as of 2000 evidence suggested that cognitive and skill differences are present earlier in development. For example, researchers have found that three- and four-year-old boys were better at targeting and at mentally rotating figures within a clock face than girls of the same age were. Prepubescent girls, however, excelled at recalling lists of words. These sex differences in cognition correspond to patterns of ability rather than overall intelligence.  Laboratory settings are used to systematically study the sexual dimorphism in problem solving task performed by adults.&lt;ref name= "Kimura"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimura|first=Doreen|title=Sex and Cognition|date=July 31, 2000|publisher=A Bradford Book|isbn=978-0262611640|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, males excel relative to females at certain spatial tasks. Specifically, males have an advantage in tests that require the [[mental rotation]] or manipulation of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=DI |last2=Halpern |first2=DF |title=The new science of cognitive sex differences. |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=January 2014 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=37–45 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2013.10.011 |pmid=24246136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a computer simulation of a maze task, males completed the task faster and with fewer errors than their female counterparts. Additionally, males have displayed higher accuracy in tests of targeted motor skills, such as guiding projectiles.&lt;ref name="Kimura"/&gt; Males are also faster on reaction time and finger tapping tests.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender differences in processing speed: A review of recent research|journal = Learning and Individual Differences|pages = 145–149|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.lindif.2010.11.021|first = Eka|last = Roivainen|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, females excel relative to males on tests that measure recollection. They have an advantage on processing speed involving letters, digits and rapid naming tasks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Females tend to have better object location memory and [[verbal memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why women see differently from the way men see?

In maze and path completion tasks, males learn the goal route in fewer trials than females, but females remember more of the landmarks presented. This shows that females use landmarks in everyday situations to orient themselves more than males. Females are better at remembering whether objects had switched places or not.&lt;ref name="Kimura"/&gt;

The '''Nobel Banquet''' ({{lang-sv|Nobelfesten}}) is an annual banquet held on 10 December in the [[Blue Hall]] of [[Stockholm City Hall]], after the [[Nobel Prize]] [[ceremony]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockholm.se/OmStockholm/Stadshuset/Festlokaler/Nobelfesten/|title=Nobelfesten - Festen|publisher=Stockholm.se|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4597253/nobel-prize-banquet-watch-live/|title=Watch the Nobel Prize Banquet Live from Stockholm|website=Time|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the banquet, for which a formal dress code exists, a [[Course (food)|multi-course dinner]] is served and entertainment provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.se/20151209/six-things-to-know-about-swedens-poshest-dinner|title=Six things to know about Sweden's poshest dinner|date=9 December 2015|publisher=The Local|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the dinner, a dance is held in the [[Golden Hall (Stockholm City Hall)|Golden Hall]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/nobel-banquet-a-sumptuous-serve-for-laureates-and-royals/a-41708521|title=Nobel Banquet: A sumptuous serve for laureates and royals - DW - 08.12.2017|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is broadcast live on [[SVT]] and [[Sveriges Radio]], and abroad with generally high ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalcourt.se/brollopet/historikochtraditioner/taffeln.4.7eb872b11280345f9fc80001204.html|title=Taffeln|publisher=Royal Court|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Nobel banquet 1958.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of large banquet|1958 Nobel Banquet in Stockholm City Hall's Golden Hall]]
The first banquet, for 113 male guests, was held in 1901&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/award_ceremonies/menus/soderlind/ Award ceremonies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428151100/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/award_ceremonies/menus/soderlind/ |date=April 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 1923 it was known as the Nobel Dinner ({{lang-sv|Nobelmiddagen}}).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockholm.se/OmStockholm/Stadshuset/Festlokaler/Nobelfesten/|title=Nobelfesten|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1930 the banquet was held in Vinterträdgården at Stockholm's [[Grand Hôtel (Stockholm)|Grand Hôtel Royal]],&lt;ref&gt;Levinovitz, Agneta Wallin, 2011, pagr 127&lt;/ref&gt; and it has also been held in the Golden Hall of the [[Swedish Academy]] (Svenska Akademien).&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/ceremonies/the-nobel-prize-award-ceremonies-and-banquets/|title=The Nobel Prize Award Ceremonies and Banquets|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banquet hosts 1,300 guests (including the [[Swedish Royal Family]]) and 200 students. Its host, the chair of the [[Nobel Foundation]], is always seated at the [[Monarchy of Sweden|royal]] table.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

During the dinner (usually four hours long) each Nobel Prize recipient makes a speech, often lighthearted in character.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; There are two ceremonial cheers: one for the Swedish monarch and the other, made by the monarch, in memory of [[Alfred Nobel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826112854/http://www.losnummer.se/wp-content/uppladdat/2009/07/7-07.pdf|title=The Nobel Banquet |date=26 August 2010|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speeches and cheers are presented by the banquet's toastmaster, traditionally a Swedish student who holds the job for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssco.se/nobeltoastmaster/|title=SSCO och Nobelstiftelsen söker ny toastmaster till Nobel|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324141142/http://www.ssco.se/nobeltoastmaster/|archivedate=24 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216154102/http://www.ingenjorskarriar.se/din_utveckling/article3952991.ece|title=Ingenjörens uppdrag: Vara Nobelfestens toastmaster - Ingenjörskarriär|date=16 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service during the banquet is provided by [[waiting staff]], [[chefs]], and others who are trained for several weeks.&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"/&gt; Since the 1970s, flowers for the banquet have been provided by the Italian city of [[Sanremo]] (where Nobel lived during his final years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/forsta-nobelmiddagen-for-sveriges-nye-prins_5801727.svd|title=Första nobelmiddagen för Sveriges nye prins|work=SvD.se|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are grown in the [[province of Imperia]] in the [[Liguria]] region of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/resor/besok-nobels-blommor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004211014/http://www.dn.se/resor/besok-nobels-blommor|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 October 2011|title=Besök Nobels blommor|work=DN.SE|accessdate=11 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Runic text}}
The [[Elder Futhark]] '''Odal''' [[rune]] ({{script|Runr|ᛟ}}), also known as the '''Othala''' rune, represents the ''o'' sound. Its reconstructed [[Proto-Germanic]] name is *''ōþalan'' "heritage; inheritance, inherited estate".

It was in use for [[epigraphy]] during the 3rd to the 8th centuries. It is not continued in the [[Younger Futhark]], disappearing from the Scandinavian record around the 6th century, but it survived in the [[Anglo-Saxon Futhorc]], and expressed the Old English ''œ'' phoneme during the 7th and 8th centuries.
Its name is attested as ''ēðel'' in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript tradition.

The rune is encoded in [[Unicode]] at code point U+16DF: '''{{script|Runr|ᛟ}}'''.

==Name and etymology==
{{further| Ethel}}
The [[Common Germanic]] stem ''ōþala-'' or ''ōþila-'' "inherited estate" is an [[ablaut]] variant of the stem ''aþal-''.  It consists of a root ''aþ-'' and a suffix ''-ila-'' or ''-ala-''. The suffix variant accounts for the umlauted form  ''ēþel''.  Germanic ''aþal‑'' had a meaning of (approximately) "nobility", and the derivation ''aþala‑'' could express "lineage, (noble) race, descent, kind", and thus "nobleman, prince" (whence Old English [[atheling]]), but also "inheritance, inherited estate, property, possession". Its etymology is not clear, but it is usually compared to ''atta'' "father" (cf. the name [[Attila]], ultimately [[Mama and papa|baby talk for "father"]]).

There is an apparent, but debated, etymological connection of ''Odal'' to ''Adel'' (Old High German adal or edil), meaning ''nobility, noble family line, or exclusive group of superior social status; aristocracy'', typically associated with major land holdings and fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Adel]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=April 2017}}

The term ''oþal'' ([[Old High German]] ''uodal'') is a formative element in some [[Germanic name]]s, notably ''[[Ulrich]]'' and variants;, the stem ''aþal'' is more frequent, found in Gothic names such as [[Athalaric]], [[Ataulf]], etc. and in Old High German names such as ''[[Adalbert (given name)|Adalbert]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Schönfeld, Wörterbuch der altgermanischen Personen- und Völkernamen, 1911, 1f. (Adalharius, Adalhildis, Adalwal, Adaric, Adica, Adila), 33ff. (Athala, Athalaricus, Athanagildus, Athanaricus, Athavulfus), Reichert, Lexikon der altgermanischen Namen 2, 1990, 469 (Adalhari, Adalhildis, Adulouuald, Adaluuial, Atala, Athala, Athalaric, Adaric, Alaric)&lt;/ref&gt; and
Adel.  Unrelated, but difficult to separate etymologically, is the root ''aud-'' "wealth, property, possession, prosperity";&lt;ref&gt;Pokorny (1959), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; from this root are names such as
''[[Edmund (given name)|Edmund]]'' and other [[England|English]] names with the ''ed'' prefix (from [[Old English]] ''ead''), [[Germany|German]] ''[[Otto]]'' and various [[Germanic name]]s beginning with ''ed-'' or ''od-''. Possibly related is ''euþa, euþu'' a word for "child, offspring" (attested in Old Norse ''jóð'', and possibly in the name of the [[Iuthungi]]).

Odal was associated with the concept of inheritance in ancient Scandinavian property law. Some of these laws are still in effect today, and govern Norwegian property. These are the ''[[Åsetesrett]]'' (homestead right), and the ''[[Odelsrett]]'' ([[allodial right]]).

==Elder Futhark ''o''-rune==
[[File:Thorsberg Ortband.png|thumb|300px|Illustration of the Thorsberg chape showing the runic inscriptions on both sides.]]
The ''o''-rune is attested early, in inscriptions from the 3rd century, such as the [[Thorsberg chape]] ([http://abdn.ac.uk/skaldic/db.php?table=mss&amp;id=18836 DR7])  and the [[Vimose inscriptions|Vimose planer]] (''Vimose-Høvelen'', [http://abdn.ac.uk/skaldic/db.php?if=runic&amp;table=mss&amp;id=19030 DR 206]).
The letter is derived from a [[Old Italic alphabets|Raetia]]n variant of the letter [[O]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The corresponding [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic letter]] is {{script|Goth|𐍉}} (derived from Greek [[Omega|Ω]]), which had the name ''oþal''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Wolfgang Krause (1964) has speculated that the ''o'' rune is used as an ideograph denoting possession in the Thorsberg chape inscription.  The inscription has ''owlþuþewaz'', read by Krause as ''O[þila] - W[u]lþu-þewaz'' "inherited property - the servant of [[Ullr|Wulþuz]]".&lt;ref&gt;
Krause, Wolfgang, 'Die Runendenkmäler und ihre Sprache' In: ''Von der Bronzezeit bis zur Völkerwanderungszeit'', (ed.) Klose, Olaf. Neumünster 1964 [reprint 1979], 311-325.
Krause, Wolfgang, Herbert Jankuhn.  ''Die Runeninschriften im älteren Futhark'', Göttingen, 1966.
The interpretation by Krause follows an earlier suggestion by Helmut Arntz, ''Handbuch der Runenkunde'', 2nd ed., Halle/Saale 1944.  See also {{cite book |last=Spurkland |first=Terje |authorlink= |title=Norwegian Runes and Runic Inscriptions |publisher=Boydell Press |year=2005 |location= |pages=47–48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QDKqY-NWvUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  |doi=  |isbn=1-84383-186-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The odal rune is found in some transitional inscriptions of the 6th or 7th century, such as the [[Gummarp Runestone|Gummarp]], [[Björketorp Runestone|Björketorp]] and [[Stentoften Runestone|Stentoften]] runestones, but it disappears from the Scandinavian record by the 8th century. The [[Old Norse]] ''o'' phoneme is now written in [[Younger Futhark]] with the same letter as the ''u'' phoneme, the [[Ur rune]].

==Anglo-Saxon ''œ''-rune==
The [[Anglo-Saxon runes]] preserve the full set of 24 Elder Futhark runes (besides introducing innovations), but in some cases these runes are given new sound values due to [[Anglo-Frisian]] sound changes.  The odal rune is such a case: the ''o'' sound in the Anglo-Saxon system is now expressed by ''ōs'' ᚩ, a derivation of the old [[Ansuz rune]]; the odal rune is now known as ''ēðel'' (with [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] due to the form ''ōþila-'') and is used to express an ''œ'' sound, but is attested only rarely in epigraphy (outside of simply appearing in a futhark row). Epigraphical attestations include:
*the Frisian [[Westeremden yew-stick]], possibly as part of a given name ''Ƿimod'' (''Ƿimœd'')
*the Harford (Norfolk) brooch, dated c. 650, in a finite verb form: ''luda:gibœtæsigilæ'' "Luda repaired the brooch"
*the left panel of the [[Franks Casket]], twice: '' tƿœgen gibroþær afœddæ hiæ ƿylif'' "two brothers (scil. [[Romulus and Remus]]), a she-wolf nourished them".

The [[Anglo-Saxon rune poem]] preserves the meaning "an inherited estate" for the rune name:
{|
| style="padding-left:20pt;" |
&lt;poem&gt;
''{{runic|ᛟ}} byþ oferleof æghƿylcum men,''
''gif he mot ðær rihtes and gerysena on''
''brucan on bolde bleadum oftast.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| style="padding-left:20pt;" |
&lt;poem&gt;
[An estate] is very dear to every man,
if he can enjoy there in his house
whatever is right and proper in constant prosperity.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

==Modern use==

===Germany===
{{Further|Nazi symbolism|Strafgesetzbuch § 86a|Odalism|Troll cross}}

[[File:23adivss.gif|thumb|Insignia of the [[23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland]].]]
The rendition of the Odal rune with ''wings'' or ''feet'' ([[serifs]]) was the emblem of ''ethnic Germans'' (''{{lang|de|Volksdeutsche}}'') of the [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen]] operating during World War II in the [[Nazi Germany]]-sponsored [[Independent State of Croatia]].  This rendition has been used by the Neo-Nazi {{lang|de|[[Wiking-Jugend]]}} in Germany, and in [[South Africa]] by the Anglo-Afrikaner Bond, the {{lang|af|[[Boeremag]]}}, the {{lang|af|[[Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging]]}},&lt;ref&gt;Schönteich, Martin and Boshoff, Henri ''Volk, faith and fatherland: the security threat posed by the white right'' Institute for Security Studies (South Africa)(2003) p48&lt;/ref&gt; and the Italian neo-fascist group [[National Vanguard (Italy)|National Vanguard]]. This particular rendition has no historical significance outside of Nazi Germany. Because of its Nazi associations, ''[[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|Strafgesetzbuch 86a]]'' bans any usage of the Odal rune as with most other symbols if used in a Neo-Nazi context.

Another version with arrows on the end was used by the [[23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland]].

===South Africa===
It was used by the Afrikaner Student Federation and the far-right wing [[Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging|White Liberation Movement]]. &lt;ref name="flagspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://flagspot.net/flags/qt-z_sym.html#odal|title=Neo-Nazi flag symbolism|publisher=flagspot.net|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Visser, Myda Marista ''Die Ideologiese Grondslae En Ontwikkeling Van Die Blanke Fascistiese Bewegings In Suid-Afrika, 1945- 1995'' (The ideological foundations and development of white fascist movements in South Africa, 1945-1999) M.A. Thesis University of Pretoria (1999) p164&lt;/ref&gt;
===United States===
In November 2016, the leadership of the [[National Socialist Movement (United States)|National Socialist Movement]] announced their intention to replace the [[swastika]] with the Odal rune on their uniforms and party regalia in an attempt to enter mainstream politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/americas-white-supremacists-ban-swastika-in-bold-attempt-to-go-mainstream/news-story/53f68100ba52a1e33b13cf25b794d028|title=Bizarre, bold reason America’s white supremacists just banned swastika|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germanic neopaganism===
The rendition of the Othala rune both with and without feet/wings ([[serifs]]) is used by [[Odinism|Odinists]] and [[Asatru]]ar interchangeably, usually without any relation to [[National Socialism]] or the [[Völkisch movement]].

The Odal rune was used as one of the protection runes of the [[Shadowhunters]] in the film adaptation of the first in the series of [[Cassandra Clare]] books City of Bones. It was shown prominently on the character poster for Izzy, who wears it on her collarbone. It was also used throughout promotional material to highlight the stories themes of family and inheritance.

An instrumental track on [[Agalloch]]'s second album, [[The Mantle]], is called ''Odal''.

The 8th track of [[Wardruna]]'s third album, [[Runaljod - Ragnarok]], is called ''Odal''. The song ends with a long pronunciation of the name.

In April 2014, the British [[Topman]] clothing company were forced to apologize after using the Nazi version with wings/feet in one of their clothing lines.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2603624/Topman-forced-apologise-selling-jacket-SS-symbol-chest.html|title=Topman forced to apologise after selling jacket with SS symbol on chest &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online|publisher=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television show ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' used the version with wings/feet in season 3, calling it the emblem of Thura.

The superhero web serial ''[[Worm (web serial)|Worm]]'' features a white supremacist supervillain called Othala, who wears the rune (with serifs) as her emblem.

In the second book in the [[Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard]] series by [[Rick Riordan]], the Othala rune is translated as “inheritance.” This is particularly significant to Hearthstone, representing his brother’s death and his abuse at the hands of his father.

The series is filmed in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]], where it chronicles the daily activities at the World Famous Gold &amp; Silver [[Pawnbroker|Pawn Shop]],&lt;ref&gt;Rick Harrison and Tim Keown.

The series depicts the staff's interactions with customers, who bring in a variety of [[Cultural artifact|artifact]]s to sell or pawn, and who are shown haggling over the price and discussing its historical background, with narration provided by either the Harrisons or Chumlee.

The series also follows the [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal conflicts]] among the cast. One reviewer referencing these conflicts described the show as a version of ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' "hijacked by ''[[American Chopper]]''{{'}}s Teutul family".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvrj.com/living/51132932.html Lawrence, Christopher. "Las Vegas pawnshop center of new reality series"] ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]''; July 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' has offered a similar description, calling the show "one part ''Antiques Roadshow'', a pinch of ''[[LA Ink]]'' and a dash of ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]''".&lt;ref name=TVGuide&gt;Moynihan, Rob. "Summer's Guilty Pleasures". ''[[TV Guide]]''. June 21, 2010. Page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production history and format==
''Pawn Stars'' began with [[Brent Montgomery]] and Colby Gaines of Leftfield Pictures, who were struck by the array of eclectic and somewhat seedy pawn shops in Las Vegas during a 2008 weekend visit to the city. Thinking such shops might contain unique characters, they searched for a family-run shop on which to center a TV series, until they found the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop less than two miles from the [[Las Vegas Strip]].&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek&gt;Fixmer, Andy (October 21, 2010). [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_44/b4201108281805.htm "Pawn Stars: Our Most Revealing Reality Show"]. ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been the subject of a 2001 [[PBS]] documentary,&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost&gt;Bourdeau, Annette (March 12, 2012).

''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the manager and part-owner, Rick Harrison, had been trying unsuccessfully to pitch a show based on his shop for four years.&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=VegasNews&gt;[http://www.vegasnews.com/41913/pawn-stars-richard-old-man-harrison-celebrates-70th-birthday.html "Pawn Stars’ Richard "Old Man" Harrison Celebrates 70th Birthday"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EW&gt;Smith, Grady (June 28, 2010).

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The shop, and Rick, had previously been featured in the Las Vegas episode of ''[[Insomniac with Dave Attell]]'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Gvu6APT3JLY|"Pawn Stars circa 2003"}}, accessed Sep 19, 2009, July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was originally pitched to [[HBO]], though the network preferred the series to have been a ''[[Taxicab Confessions]]''-style series taking place at the Gold &amp; Silver's night window.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison; Keown, 2011. page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The format eventually evolved into the now-familiar family-oriented motif used on the series.&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-02-19-trashtv19_CV_N.htm|title=From 'Pawn Stars' to 'Pickers,' America's trash is TV's treasure|last=Strauss|first=Gary|work=[[USA Today]]|date=February 18, 2010|accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] president [[Nancy Dubuc]], who had been charged with creating programming with a more populist appeal to balance out the network's in-depth military programming, picked up the series, which was initially titled ''Pawning History'', before a staffer at Leftfield suggested that ''Pawn Stars'' would fit better with the locale.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison; Keown, 2011. page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The network concurred, believing that name to be more pleasing and easily remembered.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; The staffer adjusted its story-line in order to bring it in line with the network's brand, which included the on-camera experts appraising the items brought into the Gold &amp; Silver, though she did not discourage the interpersonal conflicts among the show's stars.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek/&gt;

[[File:Pawn Stars shop by Mike Salvucci.jpg|thumb|right|World Famous Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop in 2010]]
The series is filmed on location at the World Famous Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas, Nevada. Although jewellery is the most commonly pawned item at the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Pezzed Off|series=Pawn Stars|season=2|number=15|network=History|date=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the customers featured in episodes bring in a variety of vintage or antique items to the store, which has 12,000 items in its inventory as of July 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Face the Music|series=Pawn Stars|network=History|date=July 25, 2011|season=4|number=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5,000 of which are typically held on pawn).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Wright Stuff|series=Pawn Stars|network=History|airdate=August 15, 2011|season=4|number=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode consists of segments devoted to approximately five or six of these items, in which one of the staff members, usually Rick Harrison, his son Corey, or Harrison's father Richard (known as the "Old Man"), explains the history behind the object. When the buyer is unable to evaluate an object, they consult with a knowledgeable expert who can evaluate it to determine its authenticity and potential value, and in the case of items needing repair, the cost of restoration or preparing the item for sale. Whoever is evaluating the object goes over the potential value with the customer, including the expert's opinion, if one is given, often interspersed with an interview in which he explains the basis of his decision to the viewer. A price tag graphic at the bottom corner of the screen provides the ever-changing dollar amount as the two haggle over the item's price. On occasion, Rick will purchase items in need of restoration before determining its restoration costs, thus taking a risk on such costs.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include the [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] in "Sharks and Cobra" and the barber's chair in "A Shot and a Shave".&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal narratives focusing on the relationship and conflicts among Rick, Corey, the Old Man, and Corey's childhood friend, Austin "Chumlee" Russell, who also works at the shop, also comprise episode plots. These usually pertain to arguments over the running of the shop, the elder Harrisons questioning Corey's judgment,&lt;ref name=CoreySales/&gt;&lt;ref name=CoreyExpensive/&gt; and aspersions cast on Chumlee's intelligence and competence.&lt;ref name=ChumSmart/&gt; Before the second commercial break, a multiple choice trivia question related to the shop and its inventory, the cast members or one of the featured items is shown, with the answer provided after the break; beginning with the Season 8 episode "A Very Vegas Christmas", a trivia question is asked at every commercial break.

In addition to spawning imitators, such as the [[truTV]] series ''[[Hardcore Pawn]]'', the success of ''Pawn Stars'' has been a boon to the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop, which has become a Las Vegas tourist site,&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; and has expanded its business accordingly. Originally averaging between 70 and 100 customers per day, the shop's traffic increased to more than 1,000 by October 2010. To handle the increased business, the shop hired nearly 30 new employees,&lt;ref&gt;Corey Harrison indicates he manages 30 employees in the second season episode "Backroom Brawl", and later states the shop has 48 employees in the third season episode "Like a Rolling Chum". The [http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/28/pawn-stars-rick-harrison-interview/ June 2010 ''Entertainment Weekly'' source] also indicates a staff of over 40 employees. According to Richard Harrison on Page 88 of his son's 2011 autobiography, ''License to Pawn: Deals, Steals, and My Life at the Gold &amp; Silver'', the shop had 12 employees at the time the show began production.&lt;/ref&gt; and underwent a $400,000 expansion of their showroom by two thirds, to 15,000 square feet,&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; the shop's tenth expansion since it opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Peacemaker|series=Pawn Stars|network=History|season=4|number=27|airdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Harrison also mentioned in the fourth season episode "Over the Top" that he was building a gym above the Pawn Shop for the staff's use.&lt;ref name=OverTheTop/&gt; The shop also now sells its own brand merchandise, whose designs originate from fans entering design competitions on [[Facebook]], which saves the Harrisons the cost of hiring professional designers. The staff's presence on Facebook and [[Twitter]] also ensures audiences during local nightclub appearances, for which Corey Harrison and Chumlee Russell are paid $1,000 a night.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney/&gt; As a result of filming at the shop, however, the four main cast members no longer work the counter, due to laws that require the identity of customers pawning items to remain confidential, and the tourists and fans taking photos and video in the showroom that would preclude this. When shooting episodes of the series, the shop is temporarily closed, with only a handful of customers allowed into the showroom.&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 2011. pp. 70, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Harrison signed a record-breaking 80-episode renewal contract for four more seasons of the series.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney/&gt;

After being broadcast during its first four years on Mondays at 10PM ET, the program moved to Thursday nights at 9PM ET on May 30, 2013,&lt;ref name=EW042213&gt;Hibberd, James (April 22, 2013).

In "Corey's Big Burn", she is shown working with night-shift customers with Chumlee, though Rick and The Old Man express concern that the double shifts Chumlee is working as a result of volunteering to train her (which they perceive to be motivated solely by his attraction to her) might be too much for him.

==Reception==

===U.S. television ratings===
By January 2011, ''Pawn Stars'' was History's highest-rated series. An original episode broadcast on January 24, 2011 was watched by seven million viewers, the most-watched telecast ever on History, according to the network and Nielsen Media Research.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;Seidman, Robert.

Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a ''[[New York Times]]'' study of the 50 TV shows with the most [[Facebook Like]]s found that ''Pawn Stars'' was most popular in rural Kentucky.&lt;ref name="katz20161227"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html |title=‘Duck Dynasty’ vs. ‘Modern Family’: 50 Maps of the U.S. Cultural Divide |last=Katz |first=Josh |date=2016-12-27 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Christopher Long, reviewing the first season DVD for DVD Town, praised the series for its cast and the educational value of the items examined, calling it "addictive" and "a big-time winner", and opined that it is the best show on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] and perhaps cable.&lt;ref name=MovieMetropolis/&gt; In one issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'', writer Rob Moynihan included the show in a list of "guilty pleasures."&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt; April McIntyre of Monsters and Critics, whose negative view of pawn shops influenced her view of the series' setting, reviewed one episode of the series, which she labeled a "cool ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]''". Though she found aspects of it interesting, she criticized what she perceived as an emphasis on cheap laughs at the expense of family [[patriarch]] Richard Harrison over the show's historical material, as well as Corey Harrison's weight. She ultimately saw potential for the series if aspects of it that she found to be in poor taste were curbed.&lt;ref name=McIntyre&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1490653.php/History_s_Pawn_Star_some_thoughts |title=April MacIntyre "History's Pawn Star$, some thoughts" Monsters and Critics; July 20, 2009 |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=March 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310172332/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1490653.php/History_s_Pawn_Star_some_thoughts |archivedate=March 10, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'''s Gary Strauss opined that the bickering among the Harrisons, as well as the customers seen in the shop, is "alternately amusing and grating".

The series has also attracted some criticism from other pawnbrokers, who while conceding its entertainment value, claim that the series' focus on the extravagant vintage items brought into the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop are not typical of the average pawn shop, whose business is predicated on individuals on fixed income who bring in conventional objects in order to pay their bills, such as electronics, tools and jewelry. Corey Grigson and Charles Brown, who own a shop called Pawn Stars, estimate that their average loan to a customer is between $50 and $100. They also point out appraisals are handled by the staff, who rely on experience, reference works and research, and not the outside experts who are frequently seen on the show aiding the Harrisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20100131/LIFESTYLE/1310324 |title=Local pawn shops see more DVDs than diamonds |last=Nelson |first=Emily |date=January 31, 2010 |work=The News-Star |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205084332/http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20100131/LIFESTYLE/1310324 |archivedate=February 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the series has also lent itself to parody. At the June 2011 [[List of National Hockey League awards|NHL Awards]] in Las Vegas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=557821 "Stars return to Vegas for the 2011 NHL Awards"]. [[National Hockey League]]. March 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hanson Brothers]] from the movie ''[[Slap Shot (film)|Slap Shot]]'' appeared in a spoof sketch in which they try to sell the [[Stanley Cup]] to Harrison at the Gold &amp; Silver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nhlbruins.tumblr.com/post/6811162375/bruins-highlights-from-the-nhl-awards "Bruins Highlights From the NHL Awards"]. [[Boston Bruins]]. June 22, 2011. Retrieved January 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The show has received 7.7/10 ratings on [[TV.com]] and has received 7.4/10 ratings on [[IMDb]].

===Awards and honors===
In 2010, Rick Harrison and the staff of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop were awarded the Pawnbroker of the Year Award by the National Pawnbrokers Association for bringing the industry greater recognition and a better image with the TV show.&lt;ref name=NewYorkPost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/blogs/luxe-life/2010/jul/23/strip-scribbles-obama-chooses-elaine-wynn-kennedy-/ "Star Surveillance"]. ''Las Vegas Weekly''. Accessed August 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2012, the [[Clark County Commission]] declared that day to be "Pawn Stars/Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Day". At the Commission meeting, Richard "The Old Man" Harrison donated $1,000 to the [[Clark County Heritage Museum]], and lent the U.S. Senate floor chair used by Senator [[Patrick McCarran]] (sold to the Gold and Silver in the ''Pawn Stars'' episode "Take a Seat") to the museum as part of a display on Senator McCarran.&lt;ref&gt;Toplikar, Dave (July 17, 2012).

===Legal issues===
In October 2012, [[A+E Networks]] and History, as well as cast members from the show, were sued in [[Clark County District Court]] in Las Vegas for [[interference with business practices]] by Wayne Jefferies, a Las Vegas promoter&lt;ref name="Sued"&gt;{{cite news|page= |newspaper= [[Associated Press]] |date=October 8, 2012|title='Pawn Stars' sued by former manager in Las Vegas |author=Ken Ritter |accessdate=October 13, 2012|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/-pawn-stars-sued-by-former-manager-173162951.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Harrisons' manager, who represented them and Austin Lee "Chumlee" Russell in their television business dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page=6 |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |date=November 5, 2011 |title=Goodman set for role as TV judge |author=John Katsilometes |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |url=http://www.zimbio.com/Las+Vegas+Sun/articles/88nzFirmNzV/Goodman+set+role+TV+judge |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215025615/http://www.zimbio.com/Las+Vegas+Sun/articles/88nzFirmNzV/Goodman+set+role+TV+judge |archivedate=February 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferies, who was instrumental in helping to launch the series,&lt;ref name="Garrett"&gt;{{cite news|page=6 |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |date=October 13, 2011 |title=Garrett to exit Trop for MGM Grand |author=John Katsilometes |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |url=http://www.zimbio.com/Las+Vegas+Sun/articles/kw0frO9lksA/Garrett+exit+Trop+MGM+Grand |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120738/http://www.zimbio.com/Las+Vegas+Sun/articles/kw0frO9lksA/Garrett+exit+Trop+MGM+Grand |archivedate=December 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page=1 |newspaper= [[Las Vegas Sun]] |date=October 14, 2011|title=Goodman stays in spotlight |author=John Katsilometes |accessdate=October 13, 2012|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2011/oct/13/disorder-court-showgirls-martinis-expected-oscar-g/}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that after the show premiered, his influence in the show was increasingly reduced, and he was ultimately fired and left without his promised share of fees and merchandising [[Royalties#Alliances and partnerships|royalties]] from the series. Jefferies states that this occurred after a January 2012 leaked story on [[TMZ on TV|TMZ]] that indicated that the ''Pawn Stars'' cast was taken aback by History's launch of the spinoff ''Cajun Pawn Stars'', of which the cast had been unaware.&lt;ref name="Sued"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page= |newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |date=October 5, 2012|title=Pawn Stars Cast Facing Lawsuit From Ex-Manager, Wayne Jefferies|author=Eric Brown |accessdate=October 13, 2012|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/pawn-stars-cast-sued-former-manager-over-alleged-breach-contract-842315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, "Chumlee" Russell pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the discovery of an arsenal of weapons, marijuana, and other drugs by police at his home in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page= |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=March 23, 2016|title='Pawn Stars' star Chumlee taking plea deal to avoid jail|author=Ken Ritter |accessdate=March 23, 2016|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/55a1a5eb553a4a74b151ede4827883fd/pawn-stars-star-chumlee-taking-plea-deal-avoid-jail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4994">The '''Peace Mothers''' (Kurdish: ''Dayîkên Aşîtîyê'', Turkish: ''Barış Anneleri'') is a women's [[civil rights movement]] in Turkey, which aims to promote peace between Turkey's different ethnic groups through [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] means.

==History==
The Peace Mothers dates from 1999. A member of the founding Assembly explained " We had come together to say that the dirty war should come to an end and that there should be peace among Turks and Kurds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Kurdish and Turkish Mothers: Let’s Build Peace Together!|publisher= International Fellowship of Reconciliation|date=2007-05-24|url= http://www.ifor.org/WPP/Articles/May24-2007OK.pdf|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the women involved have lost a close relative in the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict]]. In the words of Türkiye Bozkurt " In 1999 we came together as mothers, whose children were either in the mountains, in prisons or had lost their lives in the war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= International Women's Day for Peace and Disarmament|publisher= International Peace Bureau|year=2007|url= http://www.ipb.org/i/pdf-files/May_24-2007_Int_Womens_Day_for_Peace_and_Disarmament.pdf|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are based in [[Istanbul]] and [[Diyarbakir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Delegationsbericht der Newroz-Delegation 2008 aus München, Berlin und NRW|publisher= Deutsch-Kurdischen Gesellschaft|year=2008|url= http://www.dkg-muenchen.de/DKG%20Aktuell-Dateien/DelegationsberichtNewroz.html|accessdate=2009-08-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have been frequently in the news for their protests and court cases. In 2000, [[Amnesty International]] reported a delegation of Peace Mothers had allegedly been tortured and ill-treated, after they travelled to neighbouring Iraq to try to mediate between the two sides in the civil conflict in the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish region]] in North [[Iraq]]. The lawyer who defended them, [[Eren Keskin]], was later put on trial for having insulted the army after her description of the alleged torture of the Peace Mothers was published in a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Memorandum from Amnesty International UK|publisher= Amnesty International|date=January 2002

In June 2006, Peace Mother activists Muyesser Gunes and Sakine Arat were sentenced to 1-year jail each and 600 YTL in Ankara 4th Criminal Court on a charge of praising a separatist organisation and its leader, after they had visited the [[Turkish General Staff|General Staff]] headquarters on 22 August 2005 to present their case. The sentence was later commuted to 10 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jail sentence to Peace Mothers|publisher= Karawane|date=2006-06-03|url= http://thecaravan.org/node/757|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, twenty-four Peace Mothers aged between 40 and 75 years, were sentenced to 12 months’ jail by the Diyarbakır 4th Criminal Court after being found guilty of voicing "separatist propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Peace activists sentenced for 'separatist propaganda'|publisher= The Green Left|date=2006-07-26|url= http://www.greenleft.org.au/2006/676/7647|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Turkey sentences peace mothers to 10 months|publisher= All Empires|date=2006-07-19|url=http://www.allempires.net/topic13441&amp;OB=DESC.html|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Peace Mothers Convicted|publisher= Democratic Turkey Forum|date=2006-07-19|url=http://dtf.syncope.de/index.php?id=37&amp;tx_ttnews%5BpS%5D=1221955668&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=24&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=60&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=61&amp;cHash=26a3c93cfd|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009 a group of Peace Mothers organised a [[Peace walk|peace march]] from [[Diyarbakir]] and [[Ankara]] and held a [[sit-in]] protest near the [[Turkish General Staff]] headquarters in Ankara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Pro-peace mothers march from Diyarbekir to Ankara|publisher= AK News|date=2009-08-11|url=http://www.aknews.com/en/aknews/4/62145|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Pro-Kurdish demonstrators calling themselves "Peace Mothers" hold a sit-in protest near the Turkish General Staff headquarters in Ankara|publisher= [[Reuters]]|date=2009-08-11|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/pictures/ANK09.htm|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married to poet-playwright [[Orrick Johns]] and writer [[Malcolm Cowley]] and was the lover of playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] and poet [[Hart Crane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Time of Our Lives |last=Johns |first=Orrick |year=1937 |publisher=Stackpole |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Eugene O'Neill: Beyond Mourning and Tragedy |last=Black |first=Stephen A. |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University press.  |isbn=0-300-09399-3 |pages=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart Crane, ''The Letters of Hart Crane, 1916-1932'' (Hermitage House, 1952), page 403&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, she invited [[Dorothy Day]] to join the [[National Woman's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Catholic Pacifism |last=Klejment |first=Anne |author2=Roberts, Nancy L. |year=1996 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-275-94784-X |pages=21–22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAL7LsOGrdkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22American+Catholic+Pacifism%22&amp;num=100&amp;sig=A3sj_6J7y9JyahbdqT8BBSvzhfg#PPA21,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were jailed for 60 days for their protests but were released after 16 days and pardoned by President [[Woodrow Wilson]].[http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/daytext.cfm?TextID=504]

After divorcing her first husband, Johns, she married, in 1919, Malcolm Cowley. In 1931 she moved to Mexico to obtain a divorce. While there her long friendship with poet [[Hart Crane]] turned into Crane's first and only documented heterosexual affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Time and the Literary |last=Newman |first=Karen |author2=Clayton, Jay |author3=Hirsch, Marianne  |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-93960-7 |pages=241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqO7s2b6RjUC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=%22Peggy+Baird%22+%2Bcowley&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=FEI_CEPV0OFeo4kMW8Bv1gnSXhE }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Broken Tower |last=Mariani |first=Paul |pages=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Crane wrote to a friend about his romance with Peggy Cowley, "Rather amazing things have happened to me since Xmas. Peggy Cowley ... is mainly responsible".&lt;ref&gt;Hart Crane, ''The Letters of Hart Crane, 1916-1932'' (Hermitage House, 1952), page 403&lt;/ref&gt;  This affair has since become a major point of interest for Crane scholars—particularly for those reading him with an eye toward his sexuality—as his engagement with heterosexual life is a determining theme in his last major poem, "[[The Broken Tower]]". Appearing at moments to be a highly symbolic affirmation of their relationship, as well as a denial of his homosexual past (the 'broken tower' can be read as a defeated phallus), the poem was written just months before Crane committed suicide by jumping off the side of a boat in 1932, while on a trip to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Harold Bloom's introduction to Mark Simon's edition of Crane's poems, published by Liveright (2000), p. xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though their relationship had begun to deteriorate by that time (Crane said he had "misunderstood and misinterpreted Peggy's character quite badly"), Cowley was with Crane on the boat, and she figures briefly, but poignantly, in the events leading up to his death.&lt;ref&gt;See the last chapter in Mariani, as well as articles on "[[The Broken Tower]]" and [[Hart Crane#The 'Homosexual Text'|Hart Crane's sexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt;[http://speccoll.library.kent.edu/literature/poetry/crane.html] Almost thirty years later, she wrote about this period in an article for ''Venture'', "The Last Days of Hart Crane."&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4., No. 1, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

After Crane's death, Cowley married twice more and converted to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Marcovic, ''Peggy Baird Cowley: 'Late Have I Loved Thee': Her Wayward Journey from Greenwich Village to Rome'' (St. Matthew Books, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Cowley died of cancer at Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker Farm in Tivoli, New York, where Cowley had resided for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Mariani, ''Broken Tower: A Life of Hart Crane'' (W.W. Norton, 2000), page 427)&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/daytext.cfm?TextID=504]

The Powering Past Coal Alliance is a group of over 70 countries, cities, regions and organisations aiming to accelerate the phase out of traditional or unabated coal power.

==History==
The Alliance was launched by Canada and the UK at the COP23 climate summit in November 2017. Announcing the launch, Climate Action Network-Canada Executive Director Catherine Abreu said:

{{quotation

"Canada and the UK are right to kick-start the Alliance, as science tells us that OECD countries need to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BREAKING: 25 Jurisdictions Join Canada, UK in Coal Phaseout Alliance |url=https://theenergymix.com/2017/11/16/breaking-25-jurisdictions-join-canada-uk-in-coal-phaseout-alliance/ |accessdate=30 September 2018|date=2017-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="openeduLaunch"&gt;{{cite web |title=Canada &amp; UK launch coal phaseout plan |url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/nature-environment/environmental-studies/canada-uk-launch-coal-phaseout-plan |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Membership has grown rapidly. By the end of the summit membership was over 20 countries, regions and organisations.&lt;ref name="abcnet20"&gt;{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance: 20 countries sign up to phase out coal power by 2030 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-17/20-countries-have-signed-up-to-phase-out-coal-power-by-2030/9161056 |accessdate=29 September 2018|date=2017-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month membership had grown to over 50 countries, regions and organisations.&lt;ref name="cleantechnica50"&gt;{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance Membership Blows Out Past 50 |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/13/powering-past-coal-alliance-membership-blows-past-50/ |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018 membership stood at 74: 29 countries, 17 regions and 28 organisations.&lt;ref name="nrdc74"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Climate Action Summit: A World Moving Beyond Coal |url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/global-climate-action-summit-world-moving-beyond-coal |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 the South Korean province of [[South Chungcheong]] became the largest user of coal power to join the Alliance.&lt;ref name="ccnSChungcheong"&gt;{{cite web |title=South Korean province joins international coal phase-out club |url=http://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/10/03/south-korean-province-joins-international-coal-phaseout-club/ |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrdsSChungcheong"&gt;{{cite web |title=Korean Province to Phase Out Coal: Implications for Asia |url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/korean-province-phase-out-coal-implications-asia |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
Alliance members agree that:&lt;ref name="cleantechnica50" /&gt;

* Governments/states will phase out existing traditional coal power.
* Governments/states will create a moratorium on any new traditional coal power stations without operational carbon capture and storage.
* Businesses/organisations will power operations without coal.
* Members will ensure policies and investments support clean power.
* Members will restrict financing for traditional coal power without carbon capture and storage.

==Members==
Members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance at the start of October 2018 were:&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance: Partners |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/powering-past-coal-alliance-declaration/powering-past-coal-alliance-partners |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnet20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ccnSChungcheong" /&gt;

      <comment>/* General overview */ In the report of the Buddha's awakening (, it sais, that he saw D.O. during emerging from seven days of abiding in Nirodha Smapatti, the state of cessation of perception, feeling and consciousness. So, he didn't contemplate it, which is done by the thinking mind.  With a overly pure and calm mind he directly saw it happening, when the sense/consciousness apparatus/process kicked back in.. So, that'S direct knowledge, not thinking :-)</comment>

A '''pratyekabuddha''' or '''paccekabuddha''' ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], respectively), literally "a lone [[Buddhahood|buddha]]", "a buddha on their own" or "a private buddha", is one of three types of [[bodhi|enlightened]] beings according to some schools of [[Buddhism]]. The other two buddha types are the [[arhat]] and the ''[[Buddhahood#Samyaksambuddha|sammāsambuddha]]'' (Sanskrit ''samyaksambuddha'').

==Characteristics==

===General overview===
The ''[[yana (Buddhism)|yāna]]'' or "vehicle" by which pratyekabuddhas achieve enlightenment is called the [[pratyekabuddhayāna]] in Indian Buddhist tradition.

Pratyekabuddhas are said to achieve enlightenment on their own, without the use of teachers or guides, according some traditions by seeing and understanding [[pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]]. They are said to arise only in ages where there is no Buddha and the Buddhist teachings (Sanskrit: [[dharma]]; Pāli: ''dhamma'') are lost. "The idea of a Paccekabuddha … is interesting, as much as it implies that even when the four truths are not preached they still exist and can be discovered by anyone who makes the necessary mental and moral effort".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Eliot, [https://archive.org/details/hinduismandbuddh15255gut Hinduism and Buddhism], 3 Volumes, London, 1922, I 344–5&lt;/ref&gt; Many may arise at a single time.

According to the [[Theravada]] school, paccekabuddhas ("one who has attained to supreme and perfect insight, but who dies without proclaiming the truth to the world")&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/pa/pacceka_buddha.htm&lt;/ref&gt; are unable to teach the Dhamma, which requires&lt;ref&gt;Kloppenborg , Ria (1983). [http://www.bps.lk/olib/wh/wh305-p.html The Paccekabuddha: A Buddhist Ascetic] - A Study of the Concept of the Paccekabuddha in Pali Canonical and Commentarial Literature, The Wheel Publication No. 305–7, Kandy, Sri Lanka: Buddhist Publication Society &lt;/ref&gt; the omniscience and supreme compassion of a sammāsambuddha, and even he hesitates to attempt to teach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn06/sn06.001.than.html Ayacana Sutta: The Request (SN 6.1)] translated from the Pali by [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] @ [http://www.accesstoinsight.org Access to Insight]&lt;/ref&gt; Paccekabuddha give moral teachings but do not bring others to enlightenment. They leave no [[sangha]] as a legacy to carry on the Dhamma.

===In the ''Abhidharmasamuccaya''===
In the fourth-century Mahayana [[abhidharma]] work, the ''Abhidharma-samuccaya'', Asaṅga describes followers of the Pratyekabuddhayāna as those who dwell alone like a [[Indian rhinoceros|rhinoceros]] or as solitary conquerors (Skt. ''pratyekajina'') living in small groups.&lt;ref&gt;Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. ''Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching.'' 2001. pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Here they are characterized as utilizing the same canon of texts as the [[śrāvaka]]s, the Śrāvaka Piṭaka, but having a different set of teachings, the "Pratyekabuddha Dharma".&lt;ref&gt;Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. ''Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching.'' 2001. pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

A very early sutra, the ''[[Rhinoceros Sutra]]'', uses the exact metaphor of Asaṅga. The ''Rhinoceros Sutra'' is one of the [[Gandhāran Buddhist texts]], which are the oldest Buddhist texts known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salomon|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard G. Salomon (academic) |last2=Glass|first2=Andrew|title=A Gāndhārī Version of the Rhinoceros Sūtra: British Library Kharoṣṭhī Fragment 5B|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTmN8Xs9xBkC|year=2000|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98035-5|page=10,13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text is also present in the [[Pāli Canon]]; in the [[Sutta Pitaka]], a [[Pali]] ''Rhinoceros Sutta'' is the third sutta in the [[Khuddaka Nikaya]]'s [[Sutta Nipata]]'s first chapter ([[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 1.3).{{sfn|Thanissaro Bhikkhu|1997}}

==In the Jātakas==
Pratyekabuddhas (e.g. Darīmukha J.378, Sonaka J.529) appear as teachers of Buddhist doctrine in pre-Buddhist times in several of the [[Jataka tales]].

{{Main|Privacy}}
'''Privacy law''' refers to the laws that deal with the regulating, storing, and using of [[personally identifiable information]] of individuals, which can be [[Personally identifiable information (PII) gathering|collected]] by governments, public or private organizations, or other individuals.

Privacy laws are considered within the context of an individual's [[privacy]] rights or within reasonable [[expectation of privacy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Classification of privacy laws ==
Privacy laws can be broadly classified into:
* General privacy laws that have an overall bearing on the personal information of individuals and affect the policies that govern many different areas of information.
* Specific privacy laws that are designed to regulate specific types of information. Some examples include:
** Communication privacy laws
** Financial privacy laws
** Health privacy laws
** [[Information privacy law]]s
** Online privacy laws
** Privacy in one's home

== International legal standards on privacy ==

=== Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ===
[[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] created a voluntary Privacy Framework that was adopted by all 21 member economies in 2004 in an attempt to improve general information privacy and the cross-border transfer of information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenleaf|first=Graham|date=2009|title=Five years of the APEC Privacy Framework: Failure or promise?|ssrn=2022907|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Report|volume=25|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Framework consists of nine Privacy Principles that act as minimum standards for privacy protection: Preventing harm, Notice, Collection limitation, Use of personal information, Choice, Integrity of personal information, Security safeguards, Access and correction, and Accountability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2011, APEC implemented the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System with the goal of balancing "the flow of information and data across borders ... essential to trust and confidence in the online marketplace."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marvin, et al.|first=Lynn M.|date=2015|title=Conducting U.S. Discovery in Asia: An Overview of E-Discovery and Asian Data Privacy Laws|url=https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&amp;context=jolt|journal=Richmond Journal of Law &amp; Technology|volume=21|pages=|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four agreed-upon rules of the System are based upon the APEC Privacy Framework and include self-assessment, compliance review, recognition/acceptance, and dispute resolution and enforcement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Council of Europe ===
Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which was drafted and adopted by the [[Council of Europe]] in 1950 and currently covers the whole European continent except for Belarus and Kosovo, protects the right to respect for private life: "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence." Through the huge case-law of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]], privacy has been defined and its protection has been established as a positive right of everyone.

The Council of Europe also addressed privacy protection in regards to the Internet in 1998 when it published "Draft Guidelines for the protection of individuals with regard to the collection and processing of personal data on the information highway, which may be incorporated in or annexed to Code of Conduct."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reidenberg|first=Joel R.|date=2000|title=Resolving Conflicting International Data Privacy Rules in Cyberspace|jstor=1229516|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=52|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council developed these guidelines in conjunction with the [[European Commission]], and they were adopted in 1999.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== European Union (EU) ===
The 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] (officially Directive 95/46/EC) recognized the authority of [[National data protection authority|National data protection authorities]] and required that all [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] adhere to universal privacy protection standards.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Member States must adopt strict privacy laws that are no more relaxed than the framework provided by the directive.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhasin|first=Madan Lal|date=2016|title=Challenge of guarding online privacy: role of privacy seals, government regulations and technological solutions|url=http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.ijfa.20120106.03.html|journal=Socio-Economic Problems &amp; the State|volume=15|pages=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Directive outlines that non-EU countries must adopt privacy legislation of equal restriction in order to be allowed to exchange personal data with EU countries. Furthermore, companies in non-EU countries must also adopt privacy standards of at least equal restriction as provided in the Directive in order to do business with companies located in EU countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Thus, the Directive has also influenced the development of privacy legislation in non-European countries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The proposed [[EPrivacy Regulation (European Union)|ePrivacy Regulation]], which would replace the [[Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002]], also contributes to EU privacy regulations.

The [[General Data Protection Regulation]] will replace the Data Protection Directive of 1995 when it takes effect on 25 May 2018. A notable contribution that will come from the General Data Protection Regulation is its recognition of a "right to be forgotten", which requires any group that collects data on individuals to delete the data related to an individual upon that individual's request.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victor|first=Jacob M.|date=November 2013|title=The EU General Data Protection Regulation: Toward a Property Regime for Protecting Data Privacy|url=https://www.jstor.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/pdf/23744289.pdf|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=123|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulation was influenced by the aforementioned European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ===
In 1980, the [[OECD]] adopted the voluntary OECD Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data in response to growing concerns about information privacy and data protection in an increasingly technological and connected world.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tene|first=Omar|date=2013|title=Privacy Law's Midlife Crisis: A Critical Assessment of the Second Wave of Global Privacy Laws|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ohslj74&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1255&amp;startid=&amp;endid=1300|journal=Ohio State Law Journal|volume=74|pages=|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD Guidelines helped establish an international standard for privacy legislation by defining the term "personal data" and outlining fair information practice principles (FIPPs) that other countries have adopted in their national privacy legislation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 2007, the OECD adopted the Recommendation on Cross-border Co-operation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting Privacy. This framework is based on the OECD Guidelines and includes two cooperation based model forms to encourage the enforcement of privacy laws among member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdrecommendationoncross-borderco-operationintheenforcementoflawsprotectingprivacy.htm|title=OECD Recommendation on Cross-border Co-operation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting Privacy - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Recommendation is also notable for coining the term "Privacy Enforcement Authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenleaf|first=Graham|date=2012|title=Independence of data privacy authorities (Part 1): International standards|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364911001889|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=28|pages=|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations (UN) ===
Article 17 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] of the United Nations of 1966 also protects privacy: "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."

On 18 December 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 68/167 on the right to privacy in the digital age. The resolution makes reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirms the fundamental and protected human right of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=III.V.7 UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 68/167 (ON THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE)|url=https://dx.doi.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/10.1163/2211-4394_rwilwo_COM_033375|journal=International Law &amp; World Order: Weston's &amp; Carlson's Basic Documents|doi=10.1163/2211-4394_rwilwo_com_033375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Privacy in Australian law}}
The current state of privacy law in Australia includes Federal and state information privacy legislation, some sector-specific privacy legislation at state level, regulation of the media and some criminal sanctions. The current position concerning civil causes of action for invasion of privacy is unclear: some courts have indicated that a tort of invasion of privacy may exist in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|QDC|151|2003|litigants=Grosse v Purvis |date= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|236|2008|litigants=Giller v Procopets |date=10 December 2008 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Doe v.

===Bahamas===
The Bahamas has an official data protection law that protects the personal information of its citizens in both the private and public sector: Data Protection Act 2003 (the Bahamas Law).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Bahamas Law appoints a data protection commissioner to the Office of Data Protection to ensure that data protection is being held. Even though there is legislation enforced in the Bahamas through the Data Protection Act 2003, the act lacks many enforcements since a data protection officer doesn't need to be in office nor does any group or organization need to notify the Office of Data Protection when a hacker has breached privacy law. Also, there are no requirements for registering databases or restricting data flow across national borders. Therefore, the legislation does not meet European Union standards, which was the goal of creating the law in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Bahamas Law. http:// laws.bahamas.gov.bs/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/ 2003/2003-0003/ DataProtectionPrivacyofPersonalInformationAct_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahamas is also a member of [[Caribbean Community|CARICOM]], the Caribbean Community.

===Belize===
Belize is currently part of the minority of countries that do not have any official data privacy laws.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Greenleaf, Graham. 2015. "Global Data Privacy Laws 2015: 109 Countries, with European Laws Now a Minority"''.'' ''Privacy Laws &amp; Business International Report'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Freedom of Information Act (2000) currently protects the personal information of the citizens of Belize, but there is no current documentation that distinguishes if this act includes electronic data.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

As a consequence of the lack of official data privacy laws, there was a breach of personal data in 2009 when an employee's laptop from Belize's Vital Statistics Unit was stolen, containing birth certification information for all citizens residing in Belize. Even though the robbery was not intentionally targeting the laptop - the robber did not predict the severity of the theft - Belize was put in a vulnerable position which could have been avoided if regulations were in order.

===Brazil===
A Brazilian citizen's privacy is protected by the country's constitution, which states:

:''The intimacy, private life, honor and image of the people are inviolable, with assured right to indenization by material or moral damage resulting from its violation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituicao.htm Constituição da República Federativa do Brasil de 1988 / Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil of 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 14th, 2018 Brazil enacted a full-fledged data protection bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2015-2018/2018/Lei/L13709.htm Lei 13709 Dispõe sobre a proteção de dados pessoais e altera a Lei nº 12.965, de 23 de abril de 2014 (Marco Civil da Internet) / Law 13709 Provides for the protection of personal data and amends Law no. 12.965, of April 23, 2014 ([[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet]])]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill has 65 articles and has many similarities to the GDPR. The first translation into English of the new data protection law was published by [[Ronaldo Lemos]], a Brazilian lawyer specialized in technology, on that same date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pnm.adv.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Brazilian-General-Data-Protection-Law.pdf Translation of Brazil's Data Protection Law by Ronaldo Lemos]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|Canadian privacy law}}
In Canada, the federal ''[[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]]'' (PIPEDA) governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in connection with commercial activities and personal information about employees of federal works, undertakings and businesses. It generally does not apply to non-commercial organizations or provincial governments. Personal information collected, used and disclosed by the federal government and many crown corporations is governed by the ''[[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]]''. Many provinces have enacted similar provincial legislation such as the Ontario ''Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act'' which applies to public bodies in that province.

There remains some debate whether there exists a common law tort for breach of privacy. There have been a number of cases identifying a common law right to privacy but the requirements have not been articulated.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Somwar v. McDonald's Restaurants of Canada Ltd'', [2006] O.J. No. 64 for a discussion on this&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Eastmond v. Canadian Pacific Railway &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Canada''&lt;ref name=Eastmond&gt;''Eastmond v. Canadian western Railway &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Canada'', 11 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's Supreme Court found that CP could collect Eastmond's personal information without his knowledge or consent because it benefited from the exemption in paragraph 7(1)(b) of [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act|PIPEDA]], which provides that personal information can be collected without consent if "it is reasonable to expect that the collection with the knowledge or consent of the individual would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement".&lt;ref name=Eastmond /&gt;

===China===
Computer Processed Personal Information Protection Act was enacted in 1995 in order to protect personal information processed by computers. The general provision specified the purpose of the law, defined crucial terms, prohibited individuals from waiving certain rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kobsa|first=Alfred|title=Tailoring Privacy to Users’ Needs 1|date=2001|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44566-8_52|work=User Modeling 2001|pages=301–313|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/3-540-44566-8_52|isbn=9783540423256|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact workings from the constitution is the following: "Every person has the right to personal privacy, which includes the right to&amp;nbsp;— (a) [[confidentiality]] of their personal information; (b) confidentiality of their communications; and (c) respect for their private and family life".&lt;ref name="fiji.gov.fj" /&gt; But in this very same constitution, it is expressed that it is possible "to the extent that it is necessary" for a law to be passed that limits or impacts the execution of the right to privacy law. Another privacy related law can be seen in section 54 of the Telecommunications Promulgation passed in 2008, which states that "any service provider supplying telecommunications to consumers must keep information about consumers confidential".&lt;ref&gt;"Telecommunications Promulgation 2008" Telecommunications Authority of Fiji.

This is in regards to (but not limited to) information collected during bookings, the use of one technology of another that belongs to said company or through the use of a [[Service (business)|service]] of the company, or when making [[payment]]s. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, the Fiji is bound by the universal declaration of Human Rights which states in article two "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks".&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;"Universal Declaration of Human Rights." The United Nations.

===France===
France adopted a data privacy law in 1978. It applies to public and private organizations and forbids gathering sensitive data about physical persons (sexuality, ethnic, political or religious opinions&amp;nbsp;...). The law is administered by the [[Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés]] (CNIL), a dedicated national administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/france.php|title=Online Privacy Law: France {{!}} Law Library of Congress|last=|first=|date=2016-06-05|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|others=Atwill, Nicole|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123115319/http://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/france.php|archive-date=2014-11-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany is known to be one of the first countries (in 1970) with the strictest and most detailed data privacy laws in the world. The citizens' right to protection is stated in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Constitution of Germany]], in Art. 2 para. 1, and Art. 1 para. 1.&lt;ref&gt;Tschentscher, Axel, The Basic Law (Grundgesetz) 2016: The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany (23 May 1949) — Introduction and Translation (Fourth Edition) (6 July 2016). {{SSRN|1501131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The citizens' data of Germany is mainly protected under the [[Bundesdatenschutzgesetz|Federal Data Protection Act]] (1977) from corporations, which has been amended the most recently in 2009. This act specifically targets all businesses that collect information for its use. The major regulation protects the data within the private and personal sector, and as a member of the European Union (EU), Germany has additionally ratified its act, convention, and additional protocol with the EU according to the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC.

In Germany, there are two kinds of restrictions on a transfer of personal data. Since Germany is part of the EU Member States, the transfer of personal data of its citizens to a nation outside the EEA is always subject to a decent level of data protection in the offshore country. Secondly, according to German data policy rules, any transfer of personal data outside the EEA symbolizes a connection to a third party which requires a reason. That reason may be for emergency reasons and a provision must be met with consent by the receiver and the subject of the data. Keep in mind that in Germany, data transfers within a group of companies are subject to same treatment as transfer to third-parties if the location is outside the EEA.

Specifically the Federal Data Protection Commission is in charge of regulating the entirety of the enforcement of data privacy regulations for Germany. In addition, Germany is part of the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Western Hemisphere Data Protection Laws. 2012. U.S. Department of Commerce. http://web.ita.doc.gov/ITI/itiHome.nsf/9b2cb14bda00318585256cc40068ca69/a54f62c93fd1572985257623006e32d5/$FILE/Western%20Hemisphere%20Data%20Protection%20Laws%205-12%20final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Data Protection Commission of Ireland is a member of the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, European Data Protection Authorities, the EU Article 29 Working Party, and the [[Global Privacy Enforcement Network]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Regarding the protection of children, Germany is potentially the first nation that has played an active role in banning the share of data within toys connected to Wifi and the Internet, like for instance, "My Friend Cayla". The group in charge of protecting the data of children is the Federal Network Agency (the Bundessnetzagentur).&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holloway|first=Donell|date=16 August 2016|title=The Internet of Toys|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22041451.2016.1266124?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Communication Research and Practice|volume=2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
During the military dictatorship era the 57 AK law prohibited taking photos of people without their permission but the law has since been superseded. The 2472/1997 law protects personal data of citizens but consent for taking photos of people is not required as long as they aren't used commercially or are used only for personal archiving ("οικιακή χρήση" / "home use"), for publication in editorial, educational, cultural, scientific or news publications, and for fine art purposes (e.g. [[street photography]] which has been uphold as legal by the courts whether done by professional or amateur photographers). However, photographing people or collecting their personal data for commercial (advertising) purposes requires their consent. The law gives photographers the right to commercially use photos of people who have not consented to the use of the images in which they appear if the depicted people have either been paid for the photo session as models (so there is no separation between editorial and commercial models in Greek law) or they have paid the photographer for obtaining the photo (this, for example, gives the right to wedding photographers to advertise their work using their photos of newly-wed couples they photographed in a professional capacity). In Greece the right to take photographs and publish them or sell licensing rights over them as fine art or editorial content is protected by the [[Constitution of Greece]] (Article 14&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/Vouli-ton-Ellinon/To-Politevma/Syntagma/article-14/ Article 14 of the Constitution of Hellas]&lt;/ref&gt; and other articles) and free speech laws as well as by [[Precedent|case law]] and legal cases. Photographing the police or children and publishing the photographs in a non-commercial capacity is also legal.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the law governing the protection of personal data is principally found in the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) which came into force on 20 December 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/B4DF8B4125C4214D482575EF000EC5FF/$FILE/CAP_486_e_b5.pdf Hong Kong Ordinances — Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap.486)]&lt;/ref&gt; Various amendments were made to enhance the protection of personal data privacy of individuals through the Personal Data (Privacy) (Amendment) Ordinance 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gld.gov.hk/egazette/pdf/20121627/es12012162718.pdf Hong Kong Government Gazette Ord No.18 of 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of personal data protected include names, phone numbers, addresses, identity card numbers, photos, medical records and employment records. As Hong Kong remains a common law jurisdiction, judicial cases are also a source of privacy law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/legal/ Hong Kong Department of Justice — Legal System in Hong Kong]&lt;/ref&gt; The power of enforcement is vested with the Privacy Commissioner (the "Commissioner") for Personal Data. Non-compliance with data protection principles set out in the ordinances does not constitute a criminal offense directly. The Commissioner may serve an enforcement notice to direct the data user to remedy the contravention and/or instigate the prosecution action. Contravention of an enforcement notice may result in a fine and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/data_privacy_law/ordinance_at_a_Glance/ordinance.html The Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The Right to Privacy is a [[fundamental rights in India|fundamental right]] and an intrinsic part of Article 21 that protects life and liberty of the citizens and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. In June 2011, India passed a new privacy package that included various new rules that apply to companies and consumers. A key aspect of the new rules requires that any organization that processes personal information must obtain written consent from the data subjects before undertaking certain activities. Application of the rule is still uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941494 Regulation of the Cloud in India], Ryan, Falvey &amp; Merchant, Journal of Internet Law, Vol 15, No. 4 (October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The Aadhar Card privacy issue became controversial when the case reached the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/nation/2017/07/19/supreme-court-right-to-privacy-fundamental-right.html Aadhaar Card Privacy issue]&lt;/ref&gt;. The hearing in the [[Aadhaar]] case went on for 38 days across 4 months making it second longest SC hearing after the landmark [[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livelaw.in/aadhaar-indian-supreme-court-reserves-verdict-on-the-second-longest-hearing-after-38-days/ Aadhaar: Indian Supreme Court Reserves Verdict On The Second-longest Hearing After 38 Days]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24, 2017, a nine-judge bench of Supreme Court in [[Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India And Ors.]] unanimously held that the right to privacy is an intrinsic part of right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://previewtech.net/data-privacy-it-act-spdi-rules/ Data Privacy Regime in India: IT Act and SPDI Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the [[Information Technology Act, 2000#The Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008|Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008]] made changes to the [[Information Technology Act, 2000]] and added the following two sections relating to Privacy:
* Section 43A, which deals with implementation of ''reasonable security practices'' for ''sensitive personal data or information'' and provides for the compensation of the person affected by ''wrongful loss or wrongful gain''.&lt;ref name="itaa2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008|url=http://www.mit.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/downloads/itact2000/it_amendment_act2008.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India|access-date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section 72A, which provides for imprisonment for a period up to three years and/or a fine up to Rs. {{formatnum:500000}} for a person who causes ''wrongful loss or wrongful gain'' by disclosing personal information of another person while ''providing services under the terms of lawful contract''.&lt;ref name="http://www.itlaw.in/section-72-a-punishment-for-disclosure-of-information-in-breach-of-lawful-contract/"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.itlaw.in/section-72-a-punishment-for-disclosure-of-information-in-breach-of-lawful-contract/ |title= Section 72 A: Punishment for Disclosure of information in breach of lawful contract|work= Section 72 A: Punishment for Disclosure of information in breach of lawful contract}}&lt;/ref&gt; A constitutional bench of the Supreme Court declared 'Privacy' as a fundamental right on August 24, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/india/right-to-privacy-verdict-live-updates-supreme-court-aadhaar-judgment-4810934/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The island of Ireland is under the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act 1988]] and amended by the Data Protection Act 2003 along with the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC, which regulates the utilization of personal data. [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act 1988]] along with 2003 is known as the DPA and protects data within the private and personal sector. The DPA ensures that when data is transported, the location must be safe and in acknowledgement of the legislation to maintain [[Information privacy|data privacy]]When collecting and processing data, some of the requirements are listed below:
* the subject of personal data must have given [[consent]]
* the data is in the subject's interest
* the reason for the processing of data is for a contract
* the reason for the processing of data is the prevention of injury
Specifically the [[Data Protection Commissioner]] oversees the entirety of the enforcement of data privacy regulations for Ireland.

=== Kenya ===
Kenya at the moment does not have a strong general privacy protection law for its constituents. But in chapter 4&amp;nbsp;— The Bill of Rights and in the second part which is titled "Rights and Fundamental Freedoms," of the [[Constitution of Kenya|consitiution]] privacy is allocated its own section. There we see that the [[Government of Kenya|Kenyan government]] express that all its people have the right to privacy, "...&amp;nbsp;which includes the right not to have&amp;nbsp;— (a) their person, home or property searched; (b) their possessions seized; (c) information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed, or (d) the privacy of their communications infringed".&lt;ref&gt;Laws of Kenya.

Regarding privacy laws relating to data privacy, like many African countries as expressed by Alex Boniface Makulilo, Kenya's privacy laws are far from the European 'adequacy' standard".&lt;ref&gt;Alex Boniface Makulilo; Data Protection Regimes in Africa: too far from the European 'adequacy' standard? International Data Privacy Law 2013; 3 (1): 42–50. {{doi|10.1093/idpl/ips031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya is making progress. As of today, the country does have laws that focus on specific sectors. The following are the sectors: communication and information. The law pertaining to this is called the Kenya Information and Communication Act.&lt;ref name="nortonrosefulbright.com"&gt;Anon. 2017. "Global Data Privacy". Nortonrosefulbright.

This act also goes as far as protecting data for Kenyans especially for the use of fraud and other ill manners. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, Kenya is bound by [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|the universal declaration of Human Rights]] which states in article two "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation.

=== Malaysia ===
After their independence from Great Britain in 1957, Malaysia's existing legal system was based primarily on English common law.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Mathews|date=2004|title=Is Malaysia's MyKad the "one card to rule them all"?

In June 2010, the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Malaysian Parliament]] passed the Personal Data Protection Act 2010, and it came into effect in 2013.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;Anon. 2017. "Global Data Privacy Directory". Norton Rose Fulbright. Retrieved 21 March 2018. http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/files/global-data-privacy-directory-52687.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It outlines seven Personal Data Protection Principles that entities operating in Malaysia must adhere to: the General Principle, the Notice and Choice Principle, the Disclosure Principle, the Security Principle, the Retention Principle, the Data Integrity Principle, and the Access Principle.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; The Act defines personal data as "'information in respect of commercial transactions that relates directly or indirectly to the data subject, who is identified or identifiable from that information or from that and other information."&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

A notable contribution to general privacy law is the Act's distinction between personal data and sensitive personal data, which entails different protections.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chik|first=Warren B.|date=2013|title=The Singapore Personal Data Protection Act and an assessment of future trends in data privacy reform|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364913001374|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=29|pages=554–575|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal data includes "information in respect of commercial transactions ... that relates directly or indirectly to a data subject" while sensitive personal data includes any "personal data consisting of information as to the physical or mental health or condition of a data subject, his political opinions, his religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pdp.gov.my/images/LAWS_OF_MALAYSIA_PDPA.pdf|title=Laws of Malaysia - Act 709 Personal Data Protection Act 2010|last=Parliament of Malaysia|first=|date=June 2010|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Act does not apply to information processed outside the country, it does restrict cross-border transfers of data from Malaysia outwards.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, the Act offers individuals the "right to access and correct the personal data held by data users", "the right to withdraw consent to the processing of personal data", and "the right to prevent data users from processing personal data for the purpose of direct marketing."&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Punishment for violating the Personal Data Protection Act can include fines or even imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Mexico===
On 5 July 2010, Mexico enacted a new privacy package focused on treatment of personal data by private entities. The key elements included were:
* Requirement of all private entities who gather personal data to publish their privacy policy in accordance to the law.
* Set fines for up to $16,000,000 MXN in case of violation of the law.
* Set prison penalties to serious violations.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the Privacy Act 1993 sets out principles in relation to the collection, use, disclosure, security and access to personal information.

The introduction into the New Zealand common law of a tort covering invasion of personal privacy at least by public disclosure of private facts was at issue in ''Hosking v Runting'' and was accepted by the Court of Appeal. In ''Rogers v TVNZ Ltd'' the Supreme Court indicated it had some misgivings with how the tort was introduced, but chose not to interfere with it at that stage.

Complaints about privacy are considered by the [http://www.privacy.org.nz ''Privacy Commissioner'']

===Nigeria===
Federal Republic of Nigeria's constitution offers its constituents the right to [[privacy]] as well as privacy protection. The following can be found in the constitution pertaining to this: "The privacy of citizens, their homes, correspondence, telephone conversations and telegraphic communications is hereby guaranteed and protected".&lt;ref&gt;"Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999." Nigeria-Law. Retrieved 13 April 2017. http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, Nigeria is bound by the universal declaration of Human Rights which states in article twelve "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks".&lt;ref name="un.org" /&gt; Nigeria is one of the few African countries that is building on the privacy laws. This is evident in the fact that Nine years later in the year 2008, the [[Computer security|Cybersecurity]] and Information Protection Agency Bill was passed. This bill is responsible for the creation of the Cybersecurity and Information Protection Agency.&lt;ref name="Anon 2017" /&gt; This agency is tasked with the job of preventing [[cyberattack]]s and regulating the Nigerian information technology industry.&lt;ref name="Anon 2017" /&gt; Additional laws have been passed that are meant to prevent the disclosure of information without permission and the intercepting of some form of transaction with or without evil intent.

=== Philippines ===
In Article III, Section 3, paragraph 1 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution of the Philippines]] lets its audience know that "The privacy of communication and correspondence shall be inviolable except upon lawful order of the court, or when public safety or order requires otherwise as prescribed by law".&lt;ref&gt;"Article III, Bill of Rights. The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines." http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-iii//&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does this country grant the [[Filipinos]] the right to privacy, but it also protects its people's right to privacy by attaching consequences to the violation of it thereof. In the year 2012, the Philippines passed the Republic Act No. 10173, also known as the "Data Privacy Act of 2012". &lt;ref&gt;"Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines." http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2012/08/15/republic-act-no-10173/&lt;/ref&gt; This act extended [[privacy]] regulations and laws to apply to more than just individual industries. This act also offered protection of data belonging to the people regardless of where it is stored, be it in private spheres or not. In that very same year, the cybercrime prevention law was passed. This law was "intended to protect and safeguard the integrity of computer and [[communications system]]s" and prevent them from being misused.&lt;ref name="nortonrosefulbright.com" /&gt; Not only does the Philippines have these laws, but it has also set aside agents that are tasked with regulating these privacy rules and due ensure the punishment of the violators. Additionally, with the constitution, previous laws that have been passed but that are in violation of the laws above have been said to be void and nullified. Another way this country has shown their dedication in executing this law is extending it to the government sphere as well. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, the Philippines is bound by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] which states in article two "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks".&lt;ref name="un.org" /&gt;

# the Law of the Russian Federation "On Personal Data" as of 27 July 2006 No. 152-FZ, regulating the processing of personal data by means of automation equipment. It is the operator who is required to comply with that Act.

As a general rule, consent of the individual is required for processing, i.e. obtaining, organizing, accumulating, holding, adjusting (updating, modifying), using, disclosing (including transfer), impersonating, blocking or destroying of his personal data. This rule doesn't apply where such processing is necessary for performance of the contract, to which an individual is a party.

=== Singapore ===
Singapore, like other Commonwealth jurisdictions, relies primarily on common law, and the law of confidence is employed for privacy protection cases.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chesterman|first=Simon|date=2012|title=After Privacy: the Rise of Facebook, the Fall of Wikileaks, and Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act 2012|ssrn=2255274|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|volume=|pages=391–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, privacy can be protected indirectly through various common law torts: defamation, trespass, nuisance, negligence, and breach of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandran|first=Ravi|date=2000|title=Privacy in Employment|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/24868246|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|volume=2000|pages=263–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, however, the Singaporean government decided that the common law approach was inadequate for their emerging globalized technological economy.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Thus, the National Internet Advisory Committee published the Model Data Protection Code for the Private Sector, which set standards for personal data protection and was influenced by the EU Data Protection Directive and the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  In the private sector, businesses can still choose to adopt the Model Code, but in 2005 Parliament decided that Singapore needed a more comprehensive legislative privacy framework.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

In January 2013, Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act 2012 came into effect in three separate but related phases.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The phases continued through July 2014 and dealt with the creation of the Personal Data Protection Commission, the national Do Not Call Registry, and general data protection Rules.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Act's general purpose "is to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations" while acknowledging the individual's right to control their personal data and the organizations' legal needs to collect this data.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It imposes eight obligations on those organizations that use personal data: consent, purpose limitation, notification, access, correction, accuracy, protection/security, and retention.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Act prohibits transfer of personal data to countries with privacy protection standards that are lower than those outlined in the general data protection rules.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The Personal Data Protection Commission is responsible for enforcing the Act, which is based primarily on a complaints-based system.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The punishments for violating the Act can include being ordered by the Commission to stop collecting and using personal data, to destroy the data, or to pay a penalty of up to $1 million.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Singapore has also passed various sector-specific statutes that more indirectly deal with privacy and personal information, including:
* Banking Act
* Statistics Act
* [[Official Secrets Act]]
* Statutory Bodies and Government Companies Act&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;
* [[Central Provident Fund]] Act
* Telecommunications Act&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are also more specific acts for electronically stored information:
* Spam Control Act 2007
* Electronic Transactions Act
* National Computer Board Act
* Computer Misuse Act&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===South Africa===
The [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]] of South Africa guarantees the most general right to privacy for all its citizens. This provides the main protection for [[Personally identifiable information|personal data]] privacy so far.

The Protection of Personal Act 2013 (POPI) was signed into act, focusing on data privacy and is inspired by other foreign national treaties like the United Kingdom. Minimum requirements are presented in POPI for the act of processing personal data, like the fact that the data subject must provide consent and that the data will be beneficial, and POPI will be harsher when related to cross-border international data transfers, specifically with personal information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, POPI won't be in full effective until an estimated date of 2018 as it is still being deliberated by the [[National Council of Provinces]].

The recording of conversations over phone and internet is not allowed without the permission of both parties with the [[Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-related Information Act, 2002|Regulation of Interception of Communications]] and [[Provision of Communications Related Act]] (2002).

===Switzerland===
The main legislation over personal data privacy for the personal and private sector in Switzerland is the [[Swiss Federal Protection Act,]] specifically the Data Protection Act, a specific section under the Swiss Federal Protection Act. The Data Protection Act has been enacted since 1992 and is in charge of measuring the consent of sharing of personal data, along with other legislation like the Telecommunication Act and the Unfair Competition Act. The Act generally guides on how to collect, process, store, data, use, disclose, and destruct data. The Data Inspection Board is in charge of overseeing data breaches and privacy enforcement.

Personal data must be protected against illegal use by "being processed in good faith and must be proportionate".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, the reason for the transfer of personal data must be known by the time of data transfer. Data not associated with people (not personal data) is not protected by the Data Protection Act.

In the case of data transfer to unsafe data protection countries, these are the major regulations required by the Data Protection Act:
* Need of direct channels for data transfer
* Individual case must have consent from receivers of data
* Disclosure is accessible to public

Switzerland is a white-listed country, meaning that it is a nation that has proper levels of data protection under the surveillance by the [[European Commission]] (EU Commission). Switzerland is not under the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf, Graham. 2015. "Global Data Privacy Laws 2015: 109 Countries, with European Laws Now a Minority"''.'' ''Privacy Laws &amp; Business International Report.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the data protection regulations are sufficient enough under European Union (EU) regulations without being a member of the EU.

In addition, Switzerland is part of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The Data Inspection Board of Switzerland is a member of the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, European Data Protection Authorities, the EU Article 29 Working Party, and the Nordic Data Protection Authorities.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Republic of China ===
The right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the Republic of China Constitution, but it can be protected indirectly through [[judicial interpretation]]. For example, article 12 of the Constitution states "the people shall have freedom of confidentiality of correspondence" while article 10 states "the people shall have freedom of residence and of change of residence."&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt; Along with several other articles that assert the Constitution's protection of freedoms and rights of the people, the Grand Justices are able to decide how privacy protection fits into the legal system.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peng|first=Shin-Yi|date=2003|title=Privacy and the Construction of Legal Meaning in Taiwan|jstor=40707869|journal=The International Lawyer|volume=37|pages=1037–1054}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justices first made reference to privacy being a protected right in the 1992 "Interpretation of Council of Grand Justices No. 293 on Disputes Concerning Debtors' Rights," but it was not directly or explicitly declared to be a right.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;

In 1995, Taiwan passed the Computer-Processed Personal Data Protection Act which was influenced by the OECD Guidelines and enforced by each separate Ministry depending on their industry sector responsibility.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenleaf|first=Graham|date=2012|title=Independence of data privacy authorities (Part 2): Asia-Pacific experience|ssrn=1971627|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=28|pages=121–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only protected personal information managed by government agencies and certain industries.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2010, Taiwan enacted the Personal Data Protection Act that laid out more comprehensive guidelines for the public and private sectors and was still enforced by individual Ministries.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In the 2010 Act, personal data is protected and defined as any "data which is sufficient to, directly or indirectly, identify that person", and includes data such as name, date of birth, fingerprints, occupation, medical records, and financial status, among many others.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

A few other administrative laws also deal with communication-specific personal privacy protection:
* Telecommunications Act
* Communications Protection and Surveillance Act

Additionally, chapter 28 of the [[Law of Taiwan|Criminal Code]] outlines punishments for privacy violations in article 315, sections 315-1 and 315-2. The sections primarily address issues of search and seizure and criminal punishment for wrongful invasion of privacy.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;

Finally, articles 18(I),184(I), and 195(I) of the Taiwanese [[s:Portal:Law of the Republic of China|Civil Code]] address the "personality right" to privacy and the right to compensation when one injures the "rights" of another, such as when someone uses another's name illegally.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

=== Thailand ===
Thailand's unique history of being an authoritarian buffer state during the Cold War and being under the constant threat of a [[coup d'état]] means that privacy laws have so far been limited in order to preserve national security and public safety.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramasoota|first=Pirongrong, et al.|date=2014|title=Online Privacy in Thailand: Public and Strategic Awareness|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jlinfos23&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|journal=Journal of Law, Information &amp; Science|volume=23|pages=97–136|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand uses bureaucratic surveillance to maintain national security and public safety, which explains the 1991 Civil Registration Act that was passed to protect personal data in computerized record-keeping and data-processing done by the government.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The legislature passed the Official Information Act 1997 to provide basic data protection by limiting personal data collection and retention in the public sector.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; It defines personal information in a national context in relation to state agencies.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Two communication technology related laws, the Electronic Transactions Act 2001 and the Computer Crime Act 2007, provide some data privacy protection and enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Nevertheless, Thailand still lacks legislation that explicitly addresses privacy security.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Thus, with the need for a more general and all-encompassing data protection law, the legislature proposed the Personal Data Protection Bill in 2013, which is heavily influenced by the OECD Guidelines and the EU Directive.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; The draft law is still under evaluation and its enactment date is not yet finalized.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Privacy in English law}}
As a member of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the United Kingdom adheres to [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]], which guarantees a "right to respect for privacy and family life" from state parties, subject to restrictions as prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society towards a legitimate aim.

However, there is no independent tort law doctrine which recognises a right to privacy. This has been confirmed on a number of occasions.

===United States===
{{Main|Privacy laws of the United States}}
The right to privacy is not explicitly stated anywhere in the Bill of Rights.
The idea of a right to privacy was first addressed within a legal context in the United States. [[Louis Brandeis]] (later a Supreme Court justice) and another young lawyer, [[Samuel D. Warren]], published an article called "The Right to Privacy" in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1890 arguing that the [[United States Constitution]] and [[common law]] allowed for the deduction of a general "right to privacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 | title = The Right to Privacy| author = Warren and Brandeis | journal = Harvard Law Review | volume = IV | date = 15 December 1890 | issue = 5 | page = 193 | doi=10.2307/1321160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their project was never entirely successful, and the renowned tort expert and Dean of the College of Law at University of California, Berkeley, [[William Lloyd Prosser]] argued that "privacy" was composed of four separate torts, the only unifying element of which was a (vague) "right to be left alone".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lloyd Prosser]], "Privacy" (1960) 48 ''[[California Law Review]]'', 383&lt;/ref&gt; The four torts were:
* Appropriating the plaintiff's identity for the defendant's benefit
* Placing the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye
* Publicly disclosing private facts about the plaintiff
* Unreasonably intruding upon the seclusion or solitude of the plaintiff
One of the central privacy policies concerning minors is the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA), which requires children under the age of thirteen to gain parental consent before putting any personal information online.&lt;ref&gt;BOYD, danah et al.

===Uzbekistan===
Though the right to privacy exists in several regulations, the most effective privacy protections come in the form of constitutional articles of Uzbekistan. Varying aspects of the right to privacy are protected in different ways by different situations.{{Vague|date=March 2016}}

=== Vietnam ===
Vietnam, lacking a general data protection law, relies on Civil Code regulations relating to personal data protection. Specifically, the Code "protects information relating to the private life of a person."&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; The 2006 Law on Information Technology protects personal information, such as name, profession, phone number, and email address, and declares that organizations may only use this information for a "proper purpose". The legislation, however, does not define what qualifies as proper.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; The 2005 Law on Electronic Transactions protects personal information during electronic transactions by prohibiting organizations and individuals from disclosing "part or all of information related to private and personal affairs ... without prior agreement."&lt;ref&gt;The National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. (2005). "Legislature XI, Session 8: Law on E-Transactions." https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/vnm_e/WTACCVNM43_LEG_5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Law on Protection of Consumers' Rights provides further protection for consumer information, but it does not define the scope of that information or create a data protection authority; additionally, it is only applicable in the private sector.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

In 2015, the Vietnam legislature introduced the Law on Information Security, which ensures better information safety and protection online and in user's computer software. It took effect on 1 July 2016 and is Vietnam's first overarching data protection legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treutler, et al.|first=Thomas J.|date=March 2016|title=Legal Update: New Regulations in the ICT Sector in Vietnam|url=http://www.tilleke.com/sites/default/files/2016_Mar_New_Regulations_ICT_Sector_Vietnam.pdf|journal=Tilleke &amp; Gibbins|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v Secretary of State for Home Affairs ex parte O'Brien''''' [1923] 2 KB 361 was a 1923 [[test case (law)|test case]] in [[English law]] that sought to have the internment and deportation of Irish nationalist sympathisers earlier that year declared legally invalid. In March 1923 between 80 and 100 suspected Irish nationalists in Britain were arrested by the police and sent to the [[Irish Free State]] under the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920]] (ROIA). One of the detainees, [[Art O'Brien]], challenged his detention in a test case at the [[Divisional Court]]. The case eventually went to both the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], who decided that the internments were illegal because the Irish Free State was an independent nation and so British Acts of Parliament no longer applied to it.

The decision effectively illegalised the ROIA and led to the immediate release of O'Brien and the other detained individuals, who sued the British Government for false imprisonment. The government pushed through the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923]], which limited the money they had to pay the detainees, who eventually received £43,000. O'Brien himself was re-arrested and found guilty of [[sedition]], and was imprisoned until 1924.

==Background==
Following the [[Irish War of Independence]] the [[Irish Free State]] was set up as an independent British [[Dominion]] covering most of the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. After a brief [[Irish Civil War|civil war]] between the pro-Free State forces and members of the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA forced underground.&lt;ref name="h36"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.123&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the [[Irish Self-Determination League]] (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them.&lt;ref name="h36"/&gt; Between February and March they provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1924) p.273&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL.&lt;ref name="h37"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.124&lt;/ref&gt; Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty&lt;ref name=am1&gt;Amato (2002) p.32&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately 100.&lt;ref name="h37"/&gt; The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a [[Royal Navy]] destroyer.&lt;ref name=am1/&gt; It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England),&lt;ref name=chand1&gt;Chandler (1924) p.274&lt;/ref&gt; at least six had never even been to Ireland before.&lt;ref name="h37"/&gt;

The next day the arrests were publicly queried in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and a Labour backbencher [[Jack Jones (Silvertown MP)|Jack Jones]] started a debate on the subject in the afternoon. [[William Bridgeman, 1st Viscount Bridgeman|W.C. Bridgeman]], the [[Home Secretary]], said that he had directly ordered the police to arrest the ISDL members under the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920]], and that he had consulted the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] who considered it legal.&lt;ref name="h37"/&gt;

==Divisional Court==
A few days after the arrests the solicitors for one of the deported men, Art O'Brien, got in contact with [[Patrick Hastings|Sir Patrick Hastings]] [[King's Counsel|KC]], a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and a noted [[barrister]].&lt;ref name="h38"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.126&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March 1923 Hastings represented O'Brien in front of a [[Divisional Court]] consisting of [[Horace Avory|Mr Justice Avory]] and [[Arthur Salter (judge)|Mr Justice Salter]] to apply for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for O'Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing did not go anywhere because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O'Brien (who was in [[Mountjoy Prison]]),&lt;ref name=chand1/&gt; which was required for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' to be considered, but by the time the hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one.&lt;ref name="h38"/&gt; Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing it, such as the 1920 act, were effectively repealed.&lt;ref name="h39"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.127&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the [[Home Secretary]] had no power to order an individual to be detained overseas because he had no control over what happened to them there.&lt;ref name="h39"/&gt;

The court eventually declared that they could not issue a writ, because the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1862]] prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional Court could not act.&lt;ref name="h39"/&gt; Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien.&lt;ref name="h40"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court of Appeal and House of Lords==
The decision was then appealed to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and argued on 23 and 24 April.&lt;ref name="h40"/&gt; The Court of Appeal reversed the [[Divisional Court]]'s decision.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner (2007) p.80&lt;/ref&gt; The court decided that the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920]] had been implicitly repealed when the [[Irish Free State]], an independent nation, came into existence. In addition it was not proper for the Home Secretary to order the detention and deportation of someone overseas, since they had no control over what happened to them.&lt;ref name=img1&gt;Amato (2002) p.33&lt;/ref&gt; It was completely appropriate to issue a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' against the Home Secretary because, even though he did not physically have O'Brien, he was considered responsible for him.&lt;ref name="h40"/&gt; The Home Secretary was accordingly ordered to produce O'Brien before the court on 16 May.&lt;ref name="h41"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

He appealed to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], who decided (led by [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]]) that they did not have the jurisdiction to hear the appeal,&lt;ref name="h41"/&gt; since a rule of English law specifies that once a writ of ''habeas corpus'' is issued (as it was by the Court of Appeal) no superior court can overrule it.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1924) p.276&lt;/ref&gt; After a further attempt to keep O'Brien in custody (simply by not letting him out of prison)&lt;ref name=am1/&gt; he was finally released on 16 May.&lt;ref name="h41"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
O'Brien immediately sued the British Government for false imprisonment, and to avoid any liability the government prepared the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923]] which would indemnify them against any claims for damages by the imprisoned sympathisers.&lt;ref name=img1/&gt; The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] whittled it down when it was being prepared so that it would only limit compensation rather than remove it entirely.&lt;ref name="h41"/&gt; A tribunal was set up under [[James Atkin, Baron Atkin|Lord Atkin]] to assess damages, and the sympathisers as a whole were eventually paid £43,000.&lt;ref name=img1/&gt; Art O'Brien himself was arrested soon after release and convicted of [[sedition]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonner (2007) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in 1924.&lt;ref name=img1/&gt;

'''Rav akçesi''' was a "[[rabbi]] tax" paid by [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish communities]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Turcica: revue d'études turques, Volumes 24-25|year=1992|publisher=Éditions Klincksieck|pages=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3lpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rav+ak%C3%A7esi&amp;dq=Rav+ak%C3%A7esi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ENqtTc77LZCp8APbtrSVAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veinstein|first=Gilles|title=Sur la draperie juive de Salonique (XVIe-XVIIe s.)|journal=Revue du monde musulman et de la Méditerranée|year=1992|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of Rav akçesi are unclear; it has been suggested that it was one of two taxes imposed specifically on Jews, and that it may have developed in parallel with the authority of a senior rabbi in [[Istanbul]], who was at nominally a representative and judge for Jewish communities in the Ottoman empire, although their authority may not have extended far beyond Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The privileges granted by Mehmed II to his Physician|journal=Bulletin of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]|year=1952|volume=14|pages=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rohschürmann|first=Michael|title="Die Tore der Freiheit"- Die Dhimma-Politik am Beispiel des jüdischen Milets im Osmanischen Reich und deren Auswirkungen auf die heutigen türkischen Juden|year=2009|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-28937-0|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that [[Mehmet II]] imposed the tax in return for separate representation of Jews after 1455, as part of a broader effort to rebuild and revive Istanbul; this may also have served to undermine the Greek patriarchy. Under the Ottoman empire there was, at time, friction between "Greeks" and "Jews"; the authorities may at times have favoured one over the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ankori, Zvi (1977). Greek Orthodox Theological Review. 22 (1): 17–57. "Greek Orthodox-Jewish Relations in Historic Perspective: The Jewish View." &lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''rav akçesi'' was a cash tax, rather than a tax in kind, it could be [[hypothecation|hypothecated]] to provide specific goods; tax records for 1655 show that the rav akçesi in [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] (Bitola) was a significant source of funding of drapery for [[Janissary|janissaries]]; the tax official responsible for purchases would be the same person responsible for collecting the tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veinstein|first=Gilles|title=Sur la draperie juive de Salonique (XVIe-XVIIe s.)|journal=Revue du monde musulman et de la Méditerranée|year=1992|issue=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslims were usually taxed at a higher rate, overall, in the Ottoman empire, thanks to taxes such as rav akçesi and [[ispence]]. Jews in particular may have been singled out to pay higher rates of ispence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical and economic geography of Ottoman Greece: the southwestern Morea in the 18th century|year=2005|publisher=ASCSA|isbn=978-0-87661-534-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was well aware of this - and even aware that this would tempt nonmuslims to convert; [[Bayezit II]] ruled that courts should treat nonmuslims more leniently (including such measures as lower fines), "''so that the poll-tax payers shall not vanish''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heyd|first=Uriel|title=Studies in old Ottoman criminal law|year=1973|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=156, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other [[Taxation in the Ottoman empire|taxes in the Ottoman empire]], rav akçesi could be affected by a complex patchwork of local rules and exemptions, including [[muafiyet]]; the Jews of Selanik ([[Thessaloniki]]) were among those exempted from taxes by a muafname after the city was conquered by [[Murad II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zachariadou|first=Elisavet|authorlink=Elizabeth Zachariadou|title=The Via Egnatia under Ottoman rule (1380-1699)|year=1992|publisher=Crete University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relativistic dynamics''' refers to a combination of [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] and [[quantum]] concepts to describe the relationships between the motion and properties of a relativistic system and the forces acting on the system. What distinguishes relativistic dynamics from other physical theories is the use of an [[Scale invariance|invariant scalar]] evolution parameter to monitor the historical evolution of [[space-time]] events. In a scale-invariant theory, the strength of particle interactions does not depend on the energy of the particles involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/13/12/2049|title=Information Theory Consequences of the Scale-Invariance of Schröedinger’s Equation|authors=Silvana Flego, Angelo Plastino, and Angel Ricardo Plastino|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Twentieth century experiments showed that the physical description of [[microscopic]] and [[submicroscopic]] objects moving at or near the [[speed of light]] raised questions about such fundamental concepts as space, time, mass, and energy. The theoretical description of the physical phenomena required the integration of concepts from relativity and [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].

[[Vladimir Fock]] &lt;ref&gt;Fock, V.A. (1937): Phys. Z. Sowjetunion 12, 404.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to propose an evolution parameter theory for describing relativistic quantum phenomena, but the evolution parameter theory introduced by [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] &lt;ref&gt;Stueckelberg, E.C.G. (1941): Helv. Phys. Acta 14, 322, 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stueckelberg, E.C.G. (1942): Helv. Phys. Acta 14, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; is more closely aligned with recent work.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1993): Found. Phys. 23, 487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (2003): “The Relativistic Quantum Potential and Non-Locality,” published in '''Horizons in World Physics''', 240, Edited by Albert Reimer, ([[Nova Science Publishers]], Hauppauge, New York), pp 117-159.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution parameter theories were used by [[Feynman]],&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, R.P. (1950): Phys. Rev. 80, 440.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]] &lt;ref&gt;Schwinger, J. (1951): Phys. Rev. 82, 664 and 914.&lt;/ref&gt; and others to formulate quantum field theory in the late 1940s and early 1950s. [[Silvan S. Schweber]] &lt;ref&gt;Schweber, S.S. (1986): Rev. Mod. Phys. 58, 449.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a nice historical exposition of Feynman’s investigation of such a theory. A resurgence of interest in evolution parameter theories began in the 1970s with the work of Horwitz and [[Constantin Piron|Piron]],&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, L.P. and C. Piron (1973): Helv. Phys. Acta 46, 316.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fanchi and Collins.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. and R.E. Collins (1978): Found. Phys. 8, 851.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invariant Evolution Parameter Concept ==

Some researchers view the evolution parameter as a mathematical artifact while others view the parameter as a physically measurable quantity. To understand the role of an evolution parameter and the fundamental difference between the standard theory and evolution parameter theories, it is necessary to review the concept of time. 

Time t played the role of a monotonically increasing evolution parameter in classical Newtonian mechanics, as in the force law F = dP/dt for a non-relativistic, classical object with momentum P. To Newton, time was an “arrow” that parameterized the direction of evolution of a system. 

[[Einstein]] rejected the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] concept and identified t as the fourth coordinate of a space-time four-[[vector (geometric)|vector]]. Einstein's view of time requires a physical equivalence between coordinate time and coordinate space. In this view, time should be a reversible coordinate in the same manner as space. Particles moving backward in time are often used to display [[antiparticles]] in Feynman-diagrams, but they are not thought of as really moving backward in time usually it is done to simplify notation. However a lot of people think they are really moving backward in time and take it as evidence for time reversibility.

The development of non-relativistic [[quantum mechanics]] in the early twentieth century preserved the Newtonian concept of time in the Schrödinger equation. The ability of non-relativistic quantum mechanics and special relativity to successfully describe observations motivated efforts to extend quantum concepts to the relativistic domain. Physicists had to decide what role time should play in relativistic quantum theory. The role of time was a key difference between Einsteinian and Newtonian views of classical theory. Two hypotheses that were consistent with [[special relativity]] were possible:

===Hypothesis I===
Assume t = Einsteinian time and reject Newtonian time.

===Hypothesis II===
Introduce two temporal variables: 
*A coordinate time in the sense of Einstein
*An invariant evolution parameter in the sense of Newton

''Hypothesis I'' led to a relativistic probability conservation equation that is essentially a re-statement of the non-relativistic continuity equation. Time in the relativistic probability conservation equation is Einstein’s time and is a consequence of implicitly adopting ''Hypothesis I''. By adopting ''Hypothesis I'', the standard paradigm has at its foundation a temporal paradox: motion relative to a single temporal variable must be reversible even though the second law of [[thermodynamics]] establishes an “arrow of time” for evolving systems, including relativistic systems. Thus, even though Einstein’s time is reversible in the standard theory, the evolution of a system is not time reversal invariant. From the perspective of ''Hypothesis I'', time must be both an irreversible arrow tied to entropy and a reversible coordinate in the Einsteinian sense.&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, L.P., S. Shashoua and W.C. Schieve (1989): Physica A 161, 300.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of relativistic dynamics is motivated in part by the concern that ''Hypothesis I'' was too restrictive.

The problems associated with the standard formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics provide a clue to the validity of ''Hypothesis I''. These problems included negative probabilities, hole theory, the [[Klein paradox]], non-covariant expectation values, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1993): '''Parametrized Relativistic Quantum Theory''' (Kluwer, Dordrecht)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, S. (1995): '''Quantum Theory of Fields''', Volume I (Cambridge University Press, New York).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prugovećki, E. (1995): Found. Phys. 24, 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these problems were never solved; they were avoided when [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) was adopted as the standard paradigm. The QFT perspective, particularly its formulation by Schwinger, is a subset of the more general Relativistic Dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1979): Phys. Rev. D 20, 2108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1993): '''Parametrized Relativistic Quantum Theory''' (Kluwer, Dordrecht)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pavsič, M. (1991): Found. Phys. 21, 1005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Pavsič, M. (1991): Nuovo Cim. A 104, 1337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pavsič, M. (2001): Found. Phys. 31, 1185 [hep-th/0011216].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pavsič, M. (2001): '''The Landscape of Theoretical Physics: A Global View''' (Kluwer, Dordrecht).&lt;/ref&gt;

Relativistic Dynamics is based on ''Hypothesis II'' and employs two temporal variables: a coordinate time, and an evolution parameter. The evolution parameter, or parameterized time, may be viewed as a physically measurable quantity, and a procedure has been presented for designing evolution parameter clocks.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1986): Phys. Rev. A 34, 1677.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fanchi, J.R. (1993): '''Parametrized Relativistic Quantum Theory''' (Kluwer, Dordrecht)&lt;/ref&gt; By recognizing the existence of a distinct parameterized time and a distinct coordinate time, the conflict between a universal direction of time and a time that may proceed as readily from future to past as from past to future is resolved. The distinction between parameterized time and coordinate time removes ambiguities in the properties associated with the two temporal concepts in Relativistic Dynamics.

'''Sumptuary laws''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''sumptuāriae lēgēs'') are [[law]]s that attempt to regulate consumption; ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines them as "Laws made for the purpose of restraining luxury or extravagance, particularly against inordinate expenditures in the matter of apparel, food, furniture, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 1436 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, they were laws that were intended to regulate and reinforce [[social hierarchy|social hierarchies]] and [[morality|morals]] through restrictions, often depending upon a person's social rank, on their permitted clothing, food, and luxury expenditures.

Societies have used sumptuary laws for a variety of purposes.  They were used as an attempt to regulate the balance of trade by limiting the market for expensive imported goods. They made it easy to identify [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|social rank]] and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], and as such could be used for [[social discrimination]].&lt;ref name="Ribeiro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ribeiro |first=Aileen |title=Dress and Morality |publisher=Berg Publishers |year=2003 |pages=12–16 |isbn=978-1-85973-782-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws frequently prevented [[commoner]]s from imitating the appearance of aristocrats and also could be used to [[social stigma|stigmatize]] disfavored groups. In the [[Late Middle Ages]], sumptuary laws in [[medieval commune|medieval cities]] were instituted as a way for the [[nobility]] to cap or limit the [[conspicuous consumption]] of the prosperous [[bourgeoisie]].  If bourgeois subjects appeared to be as wealthy or wealthier than the ruling nobility, it could undermine the nobility's presentation of themselves as powerful, legitimate rulers. This could call into question their ability to control and defend their [[fief]], and inspire potential traitors and rebels. Such laws continued to be used for these purposes well into the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro" /&gt;

==Classical world==

===Ancient Greece ===
The first written Greek law code (Locrian code), by [[Zaleucus]] in the 7th century BC, stipulated that: 
{{quote|A free-born woman may not be accompanied by more than one female slave, unless she is drunk; she may not leave the city during the night, unless she is planning to commit adultery; she may not wear gold jewelry or a garment with a purple border, unless she is a courtesan; and a husband may not wear a gold-studded ring or a cloak of Milesian fashion unless he is bent upon prostitution or adultery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001.perseus-grc3:12.21.1 "Diodorus Siculus, Library 12.21", Demosthenes Against Timocrates 139–43]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It also banned the drinking of undiluted [[wine]] except for medical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/YAK_ZYM/ZALEUCUS.html Zaleucus – Britannica 1911 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
The ''Sumptuariae Leges'' of [[ancient Rome]] were various laws passed to prevent inordinate expense (Latin ''sūmptus'') in banquets and dress, such as the use of expensive [[Tyrian purple]] dye.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000117024929/http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/survival/Alison_Austin/dyeing.html Dyeing in the ancient world – Austin, Alison, University of North Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/268/2/3.html In Support of the Oppian Law by Cato the Censor.

The World's Famous Orations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], men were forbidden to wear [[silk]].

It was considered the duty of government to put a check upon extravagance in personal expenditure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Smith | first = William | authorlink = William Smith (lexicographer) |author2=William Wayte |author3=G.

The [[Roman censor]]s, who were entrusted with the ''disciplina'' or ''cura morum'', published the ''nota censoria''. In it were listed the names of everyone found guilty of a luxurious mode of living; a great many instances of this kind are recorded. As the [[Roman Republic]] wore on, further such laws were passed; however, towards the end of the Republic, they were virtually repealed. Any such laws which may have still existed were ignored during the period of profligate [[Luxury good|luxury]] characterizing the height of the Roman Empire, except the laws regarding the wearing of Tyrian purple.&lt;ref name="CodexTheodosianus"&gt;Codex Theodosianus 14.10.2–3, tr. C. Pharr, "The Theodosian Code", p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the [[Roman Emperor]] could wear the symbol of his office, a Tyrian purple cape trimmed in [[Gold (color)|golden]] thread, and [[Roman senator]]s were the only ones who could wear the badge of their office, a Tyrian purple stripe on their toga. During the height of the Empire, expenditure on silk imported from [[China|Sinica]] was so high that Imperial advisers warned that Roman [[silver]] reserves were becoming exhausted.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Asia==

===China===
Sumptuary laws existed in China in one form or another from the [[Qin dynasty]] onwards (221&amp;nbsp;BC).  The [[Confucian]] virtue of restraint was embodied in the scholarly system central to China's bureaucracy and became encoded in its laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Spence | first = Jonathan D. | title = The Search for Modern China | publisher = [[W.W.Norton]] | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-393-30780-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some laws concerned the size and decoration of graves and mausoleums. The founder of the [[Ming dynasty]], the [[Hongwu Emperor]], issued such regulations in the first year of his rule (1368) and tightened them in 1396, allowing only the highest nobility and officials of the top three ranks a  memorial [[stele]] installed on top of a [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]]; the steles of lower-level [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]] were perched on rectangular pedestals, while commoners had to be satisfied with a simple gravestone. The location of graves, and the number of attendant statues depended on rank.&lt;ref name=deGroot2&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Brill Archive |year=1892|first=Jan Jakob Maria |last=de Groot|title=The Religious System of China|volume=II

After circa 1550, sumptuary law in China was reformed. It had long been ineffective.&lt;ref name="Pomeranz 2002 425"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pomeranz | first = Kenneth | title = Political economy and ecology on the eve of industrialisation: Europe, China and the global conjuncture | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 107 | issue = 2 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1086/532293 | pages = 425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumption of luxuries had risen over the previous several centuries, and at the time of the European [[Industrial revolution]], Chinese consumption of luxuries such as tea, sugar, fine silk, tobacco and eating utensils was on a par with [[Core-periphery|core regions]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="Pomeranz 2002 425"/&gt;

===Japan under the shōguns===
According to ''Britannica Online'', "In feudal Japan sumptuary laws were passed with a frequency and minuteness of scope that had no parallel in the history of the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9070320 Online Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tokugawa period]] (1603–1868) in Japan, people of every class were subject to strict sumptuary laws that included regulation of the types of clothing that could be worn. In the second half of that period (the 18th and 19th centuries), the merchant class (''[[chōnin]]'') had grown far wealthier than the aristocratic [[samurai]], and these laws sought to maintain the superiority of the samurai class despite the ability of the merchants to wear far more luxurious clothing and to own far more luxurious items. The [[shogunate]] eventually gave in and allowed certain concessions, including allowing merchants of a certain prestige to wear a single sword at their belt; samurai were required to wear a [[daisho|matched pair]] when on official duty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vh_rAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=daisho+edict&amp;dq=daisho+edict&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T9nATfyrKobk0QGDs6C4Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK ''Cutting Edge: Japanese Swords in the British Museum'', Victor Harris, Tuttle Pub., 2005 p.26]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic world==

Islamic sumptuary laws are based upon teachings found in the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]]. Males are exhorted not to wear silk clothes, nor have jewelry made of gold. Likewise, wearing clothes or robes that drag on the ground, seen as a sign of vanity and excessive pride, are also forbidden. These rules do not apply to women, who are allowed all this.

Prohibition of depictions of human and animal figures in general are similar to those of the Quranic prohibition on [[you shall not make for yourself an idol|graven images]]. Hadiths do allow the depiction of animals on clothing items.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Xinru. Silk and Religion: An Exploration of Material Life and the Thought of People, p.137, 1998, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-564452-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance Europe==

Sumptuary laws issued by secular authorities aimed at keeping the main population dressed according to their "station" do not begin until the later 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; pp. 114–41; Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}; M.G. Muzzarelli, ''Guardaroba medievale: Vesti e società dal XIII al XVI secolo'' (Bologna 1999) pp 268-85, 306-49.&lt;/ref&gt; These laws were addressed to the entire social body, but the brunt of regulation was directed at women and the middle classes. Their curbing of display was ordinarily couched in religious and moralizing vocabulary, yet was affected by social and economic considerations aimed at preventing ruinous expenses among the wealthy classes and the drain of capital reserves to foreign suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized very succinctly in  David Jacoby, "Silk Economics and Cross-Cultural Artistic Interaction: Byzantium, the Muslim World, and the Christian West" ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''58''' (2004: pp. 197-240) p. 206, with references.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courtesans===
Special forms of dress for [[prostitute]]s and [[courtesan]]s were introduced in the 13th century: in [[Marseilles]] a striped cloak, in England a striped hood, and so on.  Over time, these tended to be reduced to distinctive bands of fabric attached to the arm or shoulder, or tassels on the arm.  Later restrictions specified various forms of finery that were forbidden, although there was also sometimes a recognition that finery represented working equipment (and capital) for a prostitute, and they could be exempted from laws applying to other non-noble women.  By the 15th century, no compulsory clothing seems to have been imposed on prostitutes in [[Florence]], [[Venice]] (the European capital of courtesans) or [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier and Mane:139–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
In England, which in this respect was typical of Europe, from the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in the [[Medieval England|Middle Ages]] until well into the 17th century,&lt;ref name="Ribeiro" /&gt; sumptuary laws dictated what colour and type of clothing, furs, fabrics, and trims were allowed to persons of various ranks or incomes.  In the case of clothing, this was intended, amongst other reasons, to reduce spending on foreign textiles and to ensure that people did not dress "above their station":

{{quote|The excess of apparel and the superfluity of unnecessary foreign wares thereto belonging now of late years is grown by sufferance to such an extremity that the manifest decay of the whole realm generally is like to follow (by bringing into the realm such superfluities of silks, [[cloth of gold|cloths of gold]], silver, and other most vain devices of so great cost for the quantity thereof as of necessity the moneys and treasure of the realm is and must be yearly conveyed out of the same to answer the said excess) but also particularly the wasting and undoing of a great number of young gentlemen, otherwise serviceable, and others seeking by show of apparel to be esteemed as gentlemen, who, allured by the vain show of those things, do not only consume themselves, their goods, and lands which their parents left unto them, but also run into such debts and shifts as they cannot live out of danger of laws without attempting unlawful acts, whereby they are not any ways serviceable to their country as otherwise they might be|Statute issued at Greenwich, 15 June 1574, by order of [[Elizabeth I]]&lt;ref&gt;Statute issued at Greenwich, 15 June 1574, 16 Elizabeth I, [http://elizabethan.org/sumptuary/  transcribed with modernized spelling], retrieved 6 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 1571 Act of Parliament to stimulate domestic wool consumption and general trade decreed that on Sundays and holidays all males over six years of age, except for the nobility and persons of degree, were to wear woollen caps on pain of a fine of three farthings (¾ penny) per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?num=555&amp;u=1&amp;seq=438&amp;view=image&amp;size=100&amp;id=pst.000017915519 13 Eliz. c.19] ''An Acte for the making of Cappes''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/statute_cap|title=statute cap – definition of statute cap in English|work=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law instituted the [[flat cap]] as part of English wear.

===Italy===
During the Medieval and Renaissance area in Italy, various towns passed sumptuary laws (''leggi suntuarie'') often in response to particular events or movements. For example, [[San Bernardino da Siena]], in his public sermons in Siena, thundered against the vanity of luxurious dress; this, however, was counterbalanced by the economic benefit that Siena derived as a manufacturer of items, including clothes, of luxury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accademiadeirozzi.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/numero6.pdf Accademia dei Rozzi], article titled ''L'importante e aparire: le leggi suntuarie a Siena e la loro funzione'', by Renato Legarini, page 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt; One source describes these type of laws as constantly published, and generally ignored. These laws, mostly aimed at female apparel, became sometimes a source of revenue for the state: the Florentine laws of 1415 restricted the luxury that could be worn by women, but exempted those willing to pay 50 florins a year.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=SiKODAAAQBAJ La Moda: Una storie dal Medioevo a oggi
By Giorgio Riello.&lt;/ref&gt; The laws were often quite specific. Low necklines were prohibited in [[Genoa]], [[Milan]], and Rome in the early 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''History of Costume'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and laws restricting [[zibellini]] ([[sable]] [[fur]]s carried as fashion accessories) with heads and feet of precious metals and jewels were
issued in [[Bologna]] in 1545 and Milan in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;Netherton, Robin, and Gale R. Owen-Crocker, editors, ''Medieval Clothing and Textiles'', Volume 2, Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK, and Rochester, New York, the Boydell Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-84383-203-8}}, pp. 128–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[Montaigne]]'s brief essay "On sumptuary laws" criticized 16th-century French laws, beginning: 
{{quote|The way by which our laws attempt to regulate idle and vain expenses in meat and clothes, seems to be quite contrary to the end designed ... For to enact that none but princes shall eat [[turbot]], shall wear [[velvet]] or gold [[lace]], and interdict these things to the people, what is it but to bring them into a greater esteem, and to set every one more agog to eat and wear them?}}
He also cites [[Plato]] and [[Zaleucus]].

==Early modern era==
In the [[early modern period]], sumptuary laws continued to be used to support native textile industries in the face of imports.  Prohibitions continued to be tied to rank and income and continued to be widely ignored.

In 1629 and 1633, [[Louis XIII of France]] issued edicts regulating "Superfluity of Dress" that prohibited anyone but princes and the nobility from wearing [[goldwork (embroidery)|gold embroidery]] or caps, shirts, collars and cuffs embroidered with metallic threads or lace,&lt;ref&gt;Kõhler, Carl: ''A History of Costume'', Dover Publications reprint, 1963, from 1928 Harrap translation from the German, {{ISBN|0-486-21030-8}}, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; and puffs, slashes, and bunches of ribbon were severely restricted.  As with other such laws, these were widely disregarded and laxly enforced.  A series of popular engravings by [[Abraham Bosse]] depicts the supposed effects of this law.&lt;ref&gt;Lefébure, Ernest: ''Embroidery and Lace: Their Manufacture and History from the Remotest Antiquity to the Present Day'', p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial America===
In the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], only people with a personal fortune of at least two hundred pounds could wear [[lace]], silver or gold thread or [[button]]s, [[cutwork]], [[embroidery]], hatbands, belts, ruffles, capes, and other articles.  After a few decades, the law was being widely defied.&lt;ref&gt;Linda M. Scott, ''Fresh Lipstick: Redressing Fashion and Feminism'' p 24 {{ISBN|1-4039-6686-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.constitution.org/primarysources/sumptuary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
{{Main article|Clothing laws by country}}

While there are rarely restrictions on the type or quality of clothing, beyond maintenance of [[Indecent exposure|public decency]] (covering parts of the body, depending upon the [[jurisdiction]]; not exhibiting unacceptable wording or images), it is widely forbidden to wear certain types of clothing restricted to specific occupations, specifically the [[uniform]]s of organisations such as [[police]] and the [[military]].

In some jurisdictions clothing or other visible signs of religious or political opinion (e.g. Nazi imagery in Germany) are forbidden in certain public places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/node/65142 Eurasianet.org: Uzbekistan Goes After Islam with Clothing Ban and Cameras, 16 March 2012.] "A 1998 law forbids Uzbeks from wearing religious clothing in public.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtamu.edu/webres/File/Journals/MCJ/aydin.pdf Hasan Aydin, University of Nevada, Reno: Headscarf (Hijab) Ban in Turkey: importance of veiling.] "Turkey has implemented a ban on the use of the Hijab, or the headscarf, in state controlled areas like universities, government offices, and other public places."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21997089 BBC: Islamic headscarf debate rekindled in France, 2 April 2013.]  "Conspicuous signs of religious affiliation, including Islamic headscarves, are banned from French state schools, and full-face veils (burkas and niqabs) cannot be worn in public places."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The German Strafgesetzbuch (Criminal Code) in §86a outlaws "use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations".&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[United States law|American states]] in the 20th century prohibited the wearing of [[KKK]] hoods, masks, masquerade, or [[drag (clothing)|drag]]; gay men in New York City seized on the exemption for [[masquerade ball]]s in the 1920s to 1930s to go in drag.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Chauncey]], ''Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890–1940''. Basic Books, 1995. pp. 169-175, nn. 55-58; 295-296, nn. 77-79 {{ISBN|0-465-02621-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proscription or requirement of native dress==
Sumptuary laws have also been used to control populations by prohibiting the wearing of [[national dress|native dress]] and hairstyles, along with the proscription of other cultural customs.  [[John Perrot|Sir John Perrot]], Lord Deputy of Ireland under Elizabeth I, banned the wearing of traditional woollen mantles, "open smocks" with "great sleeves", and native headdresses, requiring the people to dress in "civil garments" in the English style.&lt;ref&gt;Berleth, Richard: ''The Twilight Lords'', 1978, Barnes and Noble reprint 1994, {{ISBN|1-56619-598-5}}, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar manner, the [[Dress Act 1746|Dress Act of 1746]], part of the [[Act of Proscription]] issued under [[George II of Great Britain|King George II of Great Britain]] following the [[Jacobite risings]], made wearing Scottish [[Highland dress]] including [[tartan]]s and [[kilt]]s illegal in Scotland for anyone not in the British military.  The Act was repealed in 1782, having been largely successful, and a few decades later, "romantic" Highland dress was enthusiastically adopted by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] on a [[Walter Scott]]-inspired [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland|visit to Scotland]] in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, John Telfer: ''The Costume of Scotland'', 1981, Batsford edition 1989, {{ISBN|0-7134-2535-0}}, p. 50-105 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bhutan]], the wearing of traditional dress (which also has an ethnic connotation) in certain places, such as when visiting government offices, was made compulsory in 1989 under the [[driglam namzha]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51617.htm US State Dept (two passages)] and [http://www.crin.org./docs/resources/treaties/crc.27/Bhutan.doc Submission to UN Committee, p.4]&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the traditional dress includes the [[kabney]], a long scarf whose coloring is regulated. Only the [[Druk Gyalpo|King of Bhutan]] and [[Je Khenpo|Chief Abbot]] may don the saffron scarf, with various other colors reserved for government and religious officers, and white available for common people.

==Pejorative uses of the term ''sumptuary law''==

The term ''sumptuary law'' has been used as a [[pejorative]] term to describe any governmental control of consumption, whether based on moral, religious, health, or public safety concerns. American Judge [[Thomas M. Cooley]] generally described their modern form as laws that "substitute the legislative judgment for that of the proprietor, regarding the manner in which he should use and employ his property."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas M. Cooley]], ''Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations which Rest upon the Legislative Power of the States of the American Union'', The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.; 5th edition (April 1998) (1868)&lt;/ref&gt; Policies to which the term has been critically applied include [[prohibition|alcohol prohibition]],&lt;ref name="Everett Sommerville Brown 1938"&gt;Everett Sommerville Brown, ''Ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution'', (University of Michigan: 1938)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prohibition of drugs|drug prohibition]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/1999-00/Htm/Initiatives/Initiative%20To%20The%20Legislature/INITIATIVE%20248.htm Washington State Initiative 229]&lt;/ref&gt; [[smoking ban]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Johns-Manville Sales Corp. v. International Ass'n of Machinists, Local Lodge 1609'', 621 F.2d 756, 760 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|5th Cir.]] 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''People v.

===Alcohol prohibition===
{{main article|Prohibition}}
As early as 1860, [[Anthony Trollope]], writing about his experiences in [[Maine]] under [[Maine law|the state's prohibition law]], stated, "This law (prohibition), like all sumptuary laws, must fail."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/specialrpts/alcohol/d1hist.htm "A History of Alcohol," ''Portland Press Herald'', October 19, 1997].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, [[William Howard Taft]] decried [[prohibition in the United States]] as a bad sumptuary law, stating that one of his reasons for opposing prohibition was his belief that "sumptuary laws are matters for parochial adjustment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,731975,00.html?promoid=googlep ''Burton, Baker, Taft''], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (October 15, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt; Taft later repeated this concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928319-2,00.html [[Charles Phelps Taft]], "No Taft could", ''Time Magazine'', December 10, 1928]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Indiana]] also discussed alcohol prohibition as a sumptuary law in its 1855 decision ''Herman v. State''.&lt;ref&gt;''Herman v. State'', 8 Ind. 545 (1855).&lt;/ref&gt; During state conventions on the ratification of the [[21st Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] in 1933, numerous delegates throughout the United States decried prohibition as having been an improper sumptuary law that never should have been included in the [[Constitution of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Everett Sommerville Brown 1938"/&gt;

In 1971, a United States federal study stated that federal laws on alcohol include "sumptuary laws which are directed at the purchaser", including, "Sales are not permitted to minors or intoxicated persons. Credit is often prohibited on liquor sales as well. Criminal penalties may be imposed for driving under the influence of alcohol as well as for drunken behavior."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/nc/nc2a.htm Jane Lang McGrew, ''History of Alcohol Prohibition''], published for the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug prohibition===
{{main article|Prohibition of drugs}}
When the U.S. State of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] considered [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] [[Decriminalization of non-medicinal marijuana in the United States|decriminalization]] in two initiatives, 229 and 248, the initiatives' language stated, "Cannabis prohibition is a sumptuary law of a nature repugnant to our Constitution's framers."

The '''Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief''' was established in 1986 by the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].

== Background ==
The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief]] in 1981. Although not endowed with the force of [[international law]], this resolution was the first international legal instrument devoted exclusively to the [[freedom of religion]].

In furtherance of the goals of the 1981 resolution and in support the general evolution of the freedom of religion as a [[human rights|human right]], the United Nations Commission on Human Rights established the [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs|"Special Rapporteur on Religion Intolerance]]." In 2000 the Commission on Human Rights changed the mandate title of the position to "Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief", in order that the position's name may more accurately capture the need for the Special Rapporteur to protect individuals's right to change religion or abstain from religious belief.

== Independent Experts ==
The Independent Expert is appointed by the [[UN Human Rights Council]]. The mandate holder has been invited to identify existing and emerging obstacles to the free exercise of the right to freedom of religion or belief, and present recommendations on methods by which such obstacles may be overcome.

Past Independent Experts:
*Angelo d'Almeida Ribeiro (Portugal), March 1986 -1993
*Abdelfattah Amor (Tunisia), April 1993 - July 2004
*[[Asma Jahangir]] (Pakistan), August 2004 - July 2010
*[[Heiner Bielefeldt]] (Germany), 1 August 2010 – November 2016

Current Independent Expert:
*[[Ahmed Shaheed]] (Maldives), 1 November 2016 – Present

{{Hindu philosophy}}

'''Vedanta''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|t|ə}}; [[Sanskrit]]: वेदान्त, [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Vedānta}}'') or '''Uttara Mīmāṃsā''' is one of the six [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. ''Vedanta'' literally means "end of the [[Vedas]]", reflecting ideas that emerged from the speculations and philosophies contained in the [[Upanishad]]s. It does not stand for one comprehensive or unifying doctrine. Rather it is an umbrella term for many sub-traditions, ranging from [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] to [[Advaita|non-dualism]], all of which developed on the basis of a common textual connection called the ''[[Prasthanatrayi]]''. The ''Prasthanatrayi'' is a collective term for the ''[[Principal Upanishads]]'', the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]].''

All Vedanta schools, in their deliberations, concern themselves with the following three categories but differ in their views regarding the concept and the relations between them: ''[[Brahman]]'' – the ultimate metaphysical reality,  ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' / ''[[Jiva|Jivātman]]'' – the individual soul or self, and  ''[[Prakriti]]'' – the empirical world, [[impermanence|ever-changing]] physical universe, body and matter.

Some of the better known sub-traditions of Vedanta include [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] (non-dualism), [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified non-dualism), and [[Dvaita]] (dualism). Most other Vedantic sub-traditions are subsumed under the term [[Bhedabheda]] (difference and non-difference). Over time, Vedanta adopted ideas from other [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools like ''[[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]]'' and ''[[Nyaya]]'', and, through this [[syncretism]], became the most prominent school of [[Hinduism]]. Many extant forms of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]] have been significantly shaped and influenced by the doctrines of different schools of Vedanta. The Vedanta school has had a historic and central influence on Hinduism.
{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The word ''Vedanta'' literally means the ''end of the [[Vedas]]'' and originally referred to the ''[[Upanishads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=231,232,238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vedanta was concerned with the {{IAST|''jñānakāṇḍa''}} or Vedic knowledge part called the ''Upanishads''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koller|2013|pp=100–106}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=211}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The denotation of Vedanta subsequently widened to include the various philosophical traditions based on to the ''[[Prasthanatrayi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}}; {{harvnb|Raju|1972|pp=176–177}}; {{harvnb|Isaeva|1992|p=35 with footnote 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Upanishads]]'' may be regarded as the end of ''Vedas'' in different senses:{{sfn|Raju|1972|pp=176–177}}
# These were the last literary products of the Vedic period.
# These mark the culmination of Vedic thought.
# These were taught and debated last, in the ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' (student) stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}}; {{harvnb|Scharfe|2002|pp=58–59,115–120,282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vedanta''' is one of the six [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools of [[Indian philosophy]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=231,232,238}} It is also called ''Uttara Mīmāṃsā'', the 'latter enquiry' or 'higher enquiry'; and is often contrasted with ''[[Mimamsa|Pūrva Mīmāṃsā]]'', the 'former enquiry' or 'primary enquiry'. ''Pūrva Mīmāṃsā'' deals with the ''karmakāṇḍa'' or rituals part (the ''[[Samhita]]'' and ''[[Brahmana]]s'') in the ''Vedas''.{{Sfn|Clooney|2000|pp=147–158}}{{Sfn|Mohan Lal Sandal|1925|p=16, Sutra 30}}{{refn|group=note|Historically, Vedanta has been called by various names. The early names were the Upanishadic ones (''Aupanisada''), the doctrine of the end of the ''Vedas'' (''Vedanta-vada''), the doctrine of ''[[Brahman]]'' (''Brahma-vada''), and the doctrine that ''Brahman'' is the cause (''Brahma-karana-vada'').{{Sfn|King|1995|p=268 with note 2}}}}

==''Prasthanatrayi'', the Three Sources==
The ''[[Upanishads]]'', the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavadgita]]'' and the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'' constitute the basis of Vedanta. All schools of Vedanta propound their philosophy by interpreting these texts, collectively called the ''[[Prasthanatrayi]]'', literally, ''three sources''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ranganathan}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}; {{harvnb|Grimes|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The ''[[Upanishads]]'',{{refn|group=note|The ''Upanishads'' were many in number and developed in the different schools at different times and places, some in the Vedic period and others in the medieval or modern era (the names of up to 112 ''Upanishads'' have been recorded).{{sfn|Dasgupta|1922|pp=28}} All major commentators have considered twelve to thirteen oldest of these texts as the Principal ''Upanishads'' and as the foundation of Vedanta.}} or ''Śruti prasthāna''; considered the ''[[Sruti]]'', the “heard” (and repeated) foundation of Vedanta.
# The ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', or ''Nyaya prasthana'' / ''Yukti prasthana''; considered the reason-based foundation of Vedanta.
# The ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', or ''Smriti prasthāna''; considered the ''[[Smriti]]'' (remembered tradition) foundation of Vedanta.

The ''Brahma Sutras'' attempted to synthesize the teachings of the ''Upanishads''.  The diversity in the teaching of the ''Upanishads'' necessitated the systematization of these teachings. This was likely done in many ways in ancient India, but the only surviving version of this synthesis is the ''Brahma Sutras'' of ''[[Badarayana]]''.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}

All major Vedantic teachers, including [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]], [[Rāmānuja|Ramanuja]], [[Nimbarka]], [[Vallabha Acharya|Vallabha]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], have composed commentaries not only on the ''Upanishads'' and ''Brahma Sutras'', but also on the ''Bhagavad Gita''. The ''Bhagavad Gita'', due to its syncretism of [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], and [[Upanishad]]ic thought, has played a major role in Vedantic thought.{{sfn|Pasricha|2008|p=95}}

==History==

The ''Upanishads'' present a rigorous philosophical inquiry in the form of identifying various doctrines and then presenting arguments for or against them. They form the basic texts and Vedanta interprets them through rigorous philosophical [[exegesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxx–xxxiiii}};  {{harvnb|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varying interpretations of the ''Upanishads'' and their synthesis, the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', led to the development of different schools of Vedanta over time of which three,{{sfn|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}} four,{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=177}} five&lt;ref name="Washington"&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/Colloquium03–DiffVedantas.pdf Prem Pahlajrai, Asian Languages and Literature, University of Washington, ''Vedanta: A Comparative Analysis of Diverse Schools'']{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or six{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=216}}{{refn|group=note|Sivananda also mentions Meykandar and the ''[[Shaiva Siddhanta]]'' philosophy.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=217}}}} are prominent.{{refn|group=note|Proponents of other Vedantic schools continue to write and develop their ideas as well, although their works are not widely known outside of smaller circles of followers in [[India]].}}

The history of Vedanta is divided into two periods: one prior to the composition of the ''Brahma Sutras'' and the other encompassing the schools that developed after the ''Brahma Sutras'' were written.

===Before the ''Brahma Sutras''===
Little is known{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} of schools of Vedanta existing before the composition of the ''Brahma Sutras'' (400–450 BCE).{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} considers the ''Brahma Sutras'' as a group of sutras composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years. The precise date is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|p=746}}; {{harvnb|Nakamura|1949|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} estimates that the book was composed in its current form between 400 and 450 BCE.}} It is clear that Badarayana, the writer of ''Brahma Sutras'', was not the first person to systematize the teachings of the ''Upanishads'', as he quotes six Vedantic teachers before him – Ashmarathya, Badari, Audulomi, Kashakrtsna, Karsnajini and Atreya.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxiii}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1996|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to other early Vedanta teachers – Brahmadatta, Sundara, Pandaya, Tanka and Dravidacharya – are found in secondary literature of later periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1996|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of these ancient teachers have not survived, but based on the quotes attributed to them in later literature, Sharma postulates that Ashmarathya and Audulomi were [[Bhedabheda]] scholars, Kashakrtsna and Brahmadatta were [[Advaita]] scholars, while Tanka and Dravidacharya were either Advaita or Vishistadvaita scholars.{{Sfn|Sharma|1996|pp=124–125}}

===''Brahma Sutras''===
{{Main article|Brahma Sutras}}
[[Badarayana]] summarized and interpreted teachings of the ''Upanishads'' in the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', also called the ''Vedanta Sutra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,151–152}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|pp=239–241}}; {{harvnb|Nicholson|2010|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Vedanta–sūtra are known by a variety of names, including (1) Brahma–sūtra, (2) Śārīraka–sutra, (3) Bādarāyaṇa–sūtra and (4) Uttara–mīmāṁsā.}} Badarayana summarized the teachings of the classical Upanishads&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN PHILOSOPHY|last=Satischandra Chatterjee|first=Dhirendramohan Dutta|publisher=Rupa Publications India Pvt.

Though attributed to Badarayana, the Brahma Sutras were likely composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} The estimates on when the Brahma Sutras were complete vary,&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 746&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nakamura|1949|p=436}} with Nicholson in his 2013 review stating, that they were most likely compiled in the present form around 400–450 BCE.{{sfn|Nicholson|2013|p=26, Quote: "From a historical perspective, the Brahmasutras are best understood as a group of sutras composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years, most likely composed in its current form between 400 and 450 BCE."}} Isaeva suggests they were complete and in current form by 200 CE,&lt;ref&gt;NV Isaeva (1992), Shankara and Indian Philosophy, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1281-7}}, page 36&lt;/ref&gt; while Nakamura states that "the great part of the ''Sutra'' must have been in existence much earlier than that."{{sfn|Nakamura|1949|p=436}}

The book is composed of four chapters, each divided into four quarters or sections.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}} These sutras attempt to synthesize the diverse teachings of the Upanishads. However, the cryptic nature of aphorisms of the ''Brahma Sutras'' have required exegetical commentaries.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=151–152}} These commentaries have resulted in the formation of numerous Vedanta schools, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|2010|pp=26–27}}; {{harvnb|Mohanty|Wharton|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between the ''Brahma Sutras'' and Adi Shankara===
{{See also|Vedas|Upanishads|Darsanas}}

Little with specificity is known of the period between the ''Brahma Sutras'' (5th century BCE) and Adi Shankara (8th century CE).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}{{sfn|Michael Comans|2000|p=163}} Only two writings of this period have survived: the ''Vākyapadīya'', written by [[Bhartṛhari]] (second half 5th century{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=426}}), and the ''Kārikā'' written by Gaudapada (early 6th{{sfn|Michael Comans|2000|p=163}} or 7th century CE).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}

Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his school in his commentaries.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002}} A number of important early Vedanta thinkers have been listed in the ''Siddhitraya'' by Yamunācārya (c. 1050), the ''Vedārthasamgraha'' by Rāmānuja (c. 1050–1157), and the ''Yatīndramatadīpikā'' by Śrīnivāsa Dāsa.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} At least fourteen thinkers are known to have existed between the composition of the Brahma Sutras and Shankara's lifetime.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}{{refn|group=note|Bhartŗhari (c. 450–500), Upavarsa (c. 450–500), Bodhāyana (c. 500), Tanka (Brahmānandin) (c. 500–550), Dravida (c. 550), Bhartŗprapañca (c. 550), Śabarasvāmin (c. 550), Bhartŗmitra (c. 550–600), Śrivatsānka (c. 600), Sundarapāndya (c. 600), Brahmadatta (c. 600–700), Gaudapada (c. 640–690), Govinda (c. 670–720), Mandanamiśra (c. 670–750).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}}}

A noted scholar of this period was Bhartriprapancha. Bhartriprapancha maintained that the Brahman is one and there is unity, but that this unity has varieties. Scholars see Bhartriprapancha as an early philosopher in the line who teach the tenet of [[Bhedabheda]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Essentials of Indian Philosophy|last=Hiriyanna|first=M.|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (2008 Reprint)|year=1948|isbn=978-81-208-1330-4|location=Delhi|pages=19, 21–25, 150–152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaudapada, Adi Shankara and Advaita Vedanta===
{{Main article|Advaita Vedanta|Gaudapada}}

Gaudapada (c. 6th century CE),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michael Comans|2000|p=163}}; {{harvnb|Jagannathan|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the teacher or a more distant predecessor of [[Govinda Bhagavatpada|Govindapada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Michael Comans|2000|pp=2,163}}&lt;/ref&gt; the teacher of Adi Shankara. Shankara is widely considered as the founder of [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=177}} Gaudapada's treatise, the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}''—also known as the ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'' or the ''{{IAST|Āgama Śāstra}}''{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=239}}—is the earliest surviving complete text on Advaita Vedanta.{{refn|group=note|There is ample evidence, however, to suggest that Advaita was a thriving tradition by the start of the common era or even before that. Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his Sampradaya.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002}} Scholarship since 1950 suggests that almost all [[Sannyasa#Sannyasa Upanishads|Sannyasa Upanishads]] have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olivelle|1992|pp=17–18}}; {{harvnb|Rigopoulos|1998|pp=62–63}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|1995|p=332 with note 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd Century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olivelle|1992|pp=x–xi,8–18}}; {{harvnb|Sprockhoff|1976|pp=277–294,319–377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong Advaita Vedanta views in these ancient Sannyasa Upanishads may be, states [[Patrick Olivelle]], because major Hindu monasteries of this period belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition.{{Sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=17–18}}}}

Gaudapada's ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'' relied on the [[Mandukya Upanishad|Mandukya]], [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Brihadaranyaka]] and [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chhandogya]] ''Upanishads''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=239}}; {{harvnb|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}}; {{harvnb|Nakamura|1950|p=308}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'', Advaita (non-dualism) is established on rational grounds (''upapatti'') independent of scriptural revelation; its arguments are devoid of all religious, mystical or scholastic elements. Scholars are divided on a possible influence of [[Buddhism]] on Gaudapada's philosophy.{{Refn|group=note|Scholars like {{harvtxt|Raju|1972|p=177}}, following the lead of earlier scholars like Sengupta,{{sfn|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}} believe that Gaudapada co-opted the Buddhist doctrine that ultimate reality is pure consciousness [[Yogacara#Representation–only|(''vijñapti-mātra'')]]. {{harvtxt|Raju|1972|pp=177–178}} states, "Gaudapada wove [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the Mandukaya Upanisad, which was further developed by Shankara." {{harvtxt|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}} states that the whole purpose of Gaudapada was to present and demonstrate the ultimate reality of Atman, an idea denied by [[Buddhism]]. According to {{harvtxt|Murti|1955|pp=114–115}}, Gaudapada's doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Gaudapada's influential text consists of four chapters; Chapter One, Two and Three of which are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor. Chapter Four uses Buddhist terminology and incorporates Buddhist doctrines but Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada through the 17th century, state both Murti and Richard King, never referenced nor used Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three.{{sfn|Jagannathan|2011}} While there is shared terminology, the doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different, states {{harvtxt|Murti|1955|pp=114–115}}}} The fact that Shankara, in addition to the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', the principal ''Upanishads'' and the ''[[Bhagvad Gita]]'', wrote an independent commentary on the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'' proves its importance in {{IAST|Vedāntic}} literature.{{sfn|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}}

Adi Shankara (788–820), elaborated on Gaudapada's work and more ancient scholarship to write detailed commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi and the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}''. The Mandukya Upanishad and the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'' have been described by Shankara as containing "the epitome of the substance of the import of Vedanta".{{sfn|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}} It was Shankara who integrated Gaudapada work with the ancient ''Brahma Sutras'', "and give it a ''locus classicus''" alongside the realistic strain of the ''Brahma Sutras''.{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=64}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} writes: "The ''Brahmasutras'' themselves espouse the realist Parinamavada position, which appears to have been the view most common among early Vedantins."}} His interpretation, including works ascribed to him, has become the normative interpretation of Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakamura|1950}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|Shankara synthesized the ''Advaita–vāda'' which had previously existed before him,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=678}} and, in this synthesis, became the restorer &amp; defender of an ancient learning.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} He was an unequaled commentator,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} due to whose efforts and contributions,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=678}} Advaita Vedanta assumed a dominant position within Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}}}}

A noted contemporary of Shankara was  [[Maṇḍana Miśra]], who regarded [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] and Vedanta as forming a single system and advocated their combination known as ''Karma-jnana-samuchchaya-vada''.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=239–241,372–375}}{{refn|group=note|According to Mishra, the [[sutra]]s, beginning with the first sutra of Jaimini and ending with the last sutra of Badarayana, form one compact [[shastra]].{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=239–241,372–375}}}} The treatise on the differences between the Vedanta school and the Mimamsa school was a contribution of Adi Shankara. Advaita Vedanta rejects rituals in favor of [[sannyasa|renunciation]], for example.{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=175-176}}

===Ramanuja and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta===
Rāmānuja (1017–1137 CE) was the most influential philosopher in the [[Vishishtadvaita]] tradition. As the philosophical architect of Vishishtadvaita, he taught qualified [[Nondualism|non-dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sullivan|2001|page=239}}; {{harvnb|Schultz|1981|pp=81–84}}; {{harvnb|Bartley|2013|pp=1–2}}; {{harvnb|Carman|1974|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanuja's teacher, Yadava Prakasha, followed the Advaita monastic tradition. Tradition has it that Ramanuja disagreed with Yadava and Advaita Vedanta, and instead followed [[Nathamuni]] and [[Yamunacharya|Yāmuna]]. Ramanuja reconciled the ''Prasthanatrayi'' with the theism and philosophy of the Vaishnava [[Alvars]] poet-saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olivelle|1992|pp=10–11,17–18}}; {{harvnb|Bartley|2013|pp=1–4,52–53,79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanuja wrote a number of influential texts, such as a [[bhasya]] on the ''Brahma Sutras'' and the ''Bhagavad Gita'', all in Sanskrit.{{Sfn|Carman|1994|pp=82–87 with footnotes}}

Ramanuja presented the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and [[Hindu soteriology|soteriological]] importance of bhakti, or the devotion to a personal God (Vishnu in Ramanuja's case) as a means to spiritual liberation. His theories assert that there exists a plurality and distinction between Atman (souls) and Brahman (metaphysical, ultimate reality), while he also affirmed that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the Brahman.&lt;ref name="Bartley 2013 1–2,9–10,76–79,87–98"&gt;{{harvnb|Bartley|2013|pp=1–2,9–10,76–79,87–98}}; {{harvnb|Sullivan|2001|page=239}}; {{harvnb|Doyle|2006|pp=59–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishishtadvaiata provides the philosophical basis of [[Sri Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernard|1947|pages=9–12}}; {{harvnb|Sydnor|2012|pp=0–11,20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramanuja was influential in integrating ''[[Bhakti]]'', the devotional worship, into Vedanta premises.{{Sfn|Fowler|2002|p=288}}

=== Madhva and Dvaita ===
Dvaita was propounded by Madhvacharya (1238–1317 CE).{{refn|group=note|Many sources date him to 1238–1317 period,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=12–13,359–361}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some place him over 1199–1278 CE.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}}} He presented the opposite interpretation of Shankara in his Dvaita, or dualistic system.{{sfn|Bernard|1947|pp=9–12}} In contrast to Shankara's non-dualism and Ramanuja's qualified non-dualism, he championed unqualified dualism. Madhva wrote commentaries on the chief ''Upanishads'', the ''Bhagavad Gita'' and the ''Brahma Sutra''.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|p=187}}

Madhva started his Vedic studies at age seven, joined an Advaita Vedanta monastery in Dwarka (Gujarat),{{Sfn|Sheridan|1991|p= 117}} studied under [[guru]] Achyutrapreksha,{{Sfn|Dehsen|1999|p=118}} frequently disagreed with him, left the Advaita monastery, and founded Dvaita.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=79-80}} Madhva and his followers Jayatirtha and Vyasatirtha, were critical of all competing Hindu philosophies, Jainism and Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1962|pp=128–129,180–181}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|pp=150–151,372,433–434}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; but particularly intense in their criticism of Advaita Vedanta and Adi Shankara.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=372–375}}

Dvaita Vedanta is theistic and it identifies Brahman with Narayana, or more specifically Vishnu, in a manner similar to Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. But it is more explicitly pluralistic.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=188–189}} Madhva's emphasis for difference between soul and Brahman was so pronounced that he taught there were differences (1) between material things; (2) between material things and souls; (3) between material things and God; (4) between souls; and (5) between souls and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|p=396}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocated for a difference in degrees in the possession of knowledge. He also advocated for differences in the enjoyment of bliss even in the case of liberated souls, a doctrine found in no other system of Indian philosophy. {{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=188–189}}

==Overview of the schools of Vedanta==

===Schools propounding Non-dualism===

====Advaita school====
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|right|x216px|Shankaracharya]]
{{main article|Advaita Vedanta}}
Advaita Vedanta ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|Advaita Vedānta}}''; [[Sanskrit]]: अद्वैत वेदान्त) espouses non-dualism and monism. ''Brahman'' is held to be the sole unchanging metaphysical reality and identical to ''Atman''.{{sfn|Stoker|2011}} The physical world, on the other hand, is always-changing empirical [[Maya (illusion)|''Maya'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Das|1952}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=160–161}}; {{harvnb|Doniger|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Doniger|1986|p=119}} says "that to say that the universe is an illusion (''{{IAST|māyā}}'') is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. ''Maya'' not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge."}} The absolute and infinite ''Atman''-''Brahman'' is realized by a process of negating everything relative, finite, empirical and changing.{{sfn|Das|1952}} The school accepts no duality, no limited individual souls (''Atman'' / ''Jivatman''), and no separate unlimited cosmic soul. All souls and existence across space and time is considered as the same oneness (i.e. monism).{{sfn|Sharma|2007|pp=19–40,53–58,79–86}} Spiritual liberation in ''Advaita'' is the full comprehension and realization of oneness, that one's unchanging ''Atman'' (soul) is the same as the ''Atman'' in everyone else, as well as being identical to the ''nirguna'' ''Brahman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Indich|1995|pp=1–2, 97–102}}; {{harvnb|Etter|2006|pp=57–60, 63–65}}; {{harvnb|Perrett|2013|pages=247–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vishishtadvaita'' asserts that ''Jivatman'' (human souls) and ''Brahman'' (as ''Vishnu'') are different, a difference that is never transcended.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Betty|2010|pp= 215–224}}; {{harvnb|Craig|2000|pp=517–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this qualification, Ramanuja also affirmed monism by saying that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the ''Brahman''.&lt;ref name="Bartley 2013 1–2,9–10,76–79,87–98"/&gt; ''Vishishtadvaita'', like ''Advaita'', is a non-dualistic school of Vedanta in a qualified way, and both begin by assuming that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Etter|2006|pp=57–60,63–65}}; {{harvnb|Buitenin|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the relation between the ''Brahman'' and the world of matter (''Prakriti''), ''Vishishtadvaita'' states both are two different absolutes, both metaphysically true and real, neither is false or illusive, and that ''saguna'' ''Brahman'' with attributes is also real.{{sfn|Schultz|1981|pp=81–84}} Ramanuja states that God, like man, has both soul and body, and the world of matter is the glory of God's body.{{sfn|Buitenin|2010}} The path to ''Brahman'' (''Vishnu''), according to Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of the personal god (''[[bhakti]]'' of ''saguna'' ''Brahman'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schultz|1981|pp=81–84}}; {{harvnb|Buitenin|2010}}; {{harvnb|Sydnor|2012|pp=84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shuddhādvaita====
{{main article|Shuddhadvaita}}[[File:Shri mahaprabhuji.jpg|thumb|right|text|x224px|Vallabhacharya]]
''[[Shuddhadvaita]]'' (pure non-dualism) states that the entire universe is real and is subtly ''[[Brahman]]'' only in the form of ''[[Krishna]]''.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}} Vallabhacharya, the propounder of this philosophy, agreed with Advaita Vedanta's [[ontology]], but emphasized that ''prakriti'' (empirical world, body) is not separate from the ''Brahman'', but just another manifestation of the latter.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}} Everything, everyone, everywhere—soul and body, living and non-living, ''jiva'' and matter—is the eternal ''[[Krishna]]''.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479-481}} The way to ''Krishna'', in this school, is ''[[bhakti]]''.  Vallabha opposed renunciation of monistic ''sannyasa'' as ineffective and advocates the path of devotion (''bhakti'') rather than knowledge (''jnana''). The goal of ''bhakti'' is to turn away from ego, self-centered-ness and deception, and to turn towards the eternal ''Krishna'' in everything continually offering freedom from ''[[samsara]]''.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}}

===School propounding Dualism - Dvaita===
{{main article|Dvaita}}
[[File:Shri Madhvacharya.jpg|thumb|x184px|Madhvacharya]]

This school is based on the premise of dualism. ''Atman'' (soul) and ''Brahman'' (as ''Vishnu'') are understood as two completely different entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}; {{harvnb|Dehsen|1999|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Brahman'' is the creator of the universe, perfect in knowledge, perfect in knowing, perfect in its power, and distinct from souls, distinct from matter.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=353–354}} {{refn|group=note|The concept of ''Brahman'' in ''Dvaita'' Vedanta is so similar to the monotheistic eternal God, that  some early colonial–era ''[[Indologist]]s'' such as [[George Abraham Grierson]] suggested Madhva was influenced by early [[Christian]]s who migrated to India, {{sfn|Kulandran|Hendrik|2004|pp=177–179}} but later scholarship has rejected this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}; {{harvnb|Sarma|2000|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In ''Dvaita'' Vedanta, an individual soul must feel attraction, love, attachment and complete devotional surrender to ''Vishnu'' for salvation, and it is only His grace that leads to redemption and salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1962|pp=417–424}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madhva believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned, a view not found in ''Advaita'' and ''Vishishtadvaita'' Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1960|pp=374–375}}; {{harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=361–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Vishishtadvaita'' Vedanta asserted "qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism of souls", Madhva asserted both "qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls".{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=374}}

===Schools propounding Bhedabheda===
{{main article|Bhedabheda}}''[[Bhedabheda|Bhedābheda]]'' means "difference and non–difference" and is more a tradition than a school of Vedanta. The schools of this tradition emphasize that the individual self (''Jīvatman'') is both different and not different from ''Brahman''.{{sfn|Nicholson}} Notable figures in this school are Bhartriprapancha, [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhāskara]] (8th–9th century), Ramanuja's teacher Yādavaprakāśa, [[Nimbārka]] (13th century) who founded the [[Dvaitadvaita]] school, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Caitanya]] (1486–1534) who founded the [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] school and [[Vijnanabhiksu|Vijñānabhikṣu]] (16th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson}}; {{harvnb|Sivananda|1993|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{refn|group=note|According to Nakamura and Dasgupta, the ''Brahmasutras'' reflect a ''[[Bhedabheda]]'' point of view,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} the most influential tradition of Vedanta before Shankara. Numerous Indologists, including Surendranath Dasgupta, Paul hacker, Hajime Nakamura, and Mysore Hiriyanna, have described ''Bhedabheda'' as the most influential school of Vedanta before Shankara.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}}}}

====Upadhika====
Bhaskara, in postulating ''Upadhika'', considers both identity and difference to be equally real. As the causal principle, ''Brahman'' is considered non-dual and formless pure being and intelligence.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=340}} The same ''Brahman'', manifest as events, becomes the world of plurality. ''{{IAST|Jīva}}'' is ''Brahman'' limited by the mind. Matter and its limitations are considered real, not a manifestation of ignorance. Bhaskara advocated ''bhakti'' as ''dhyana'' (meditation) directed toward the transcendental ''Brahman''. He refuted the idea of ''Maya'' and denied the possibility of liberation in bodily existence.{{sfn|Mohanty|Wharton|2011}}

====Dvaitādvaita====
[[File:Nimbarkacharya's holy icon at the Ukhra Nimbarka Peeth Mahanta Asthal(West Bengal).JPG|thumb|right|x115px|Nimbarkacharya's icon at Ukhra, West Bengal]]
{{main article|Dvaitadvaita}}[[Nimbarka|Nimbārka]] propounded ''[[Dvaitādvaita]]'', based upon [[Bhedabheda|Bhedābheda]] as was taught by [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhāskara]]. ''Brahman'' (God), souls ''(chit)'' and matter or the universe ''(achit)'' are considered as three equally real and co-eternal realities. ''Brahman'' is the controller ''(niyantr)'', the soul is the enjoyer ''(bhoktr)'', and the material universe is the object enjoyed ''(bhogya)''. The Brahman is ''[[Krishna]]'', the ultimate cause who is omniscient, omnipotent, all-pervading Being. He is the [[efficient cause]] of the universe because, as Lord of ''Karma'' and internal ruler of souls, He brings about creation so that the souls can reap the consequences of their ''karma''. God is considered to be the [[material cause]] of the universe because creation was a manifestation of His powers of soul ''(chit)'' and matter ''(achit)''; creation is a transformation ''(parinama)'' of God's powers. He can be realized only through a constant effort to merge oneself with His nature through meditation and devotion. {{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=376}}

====Achintya-Bheda-Abheda====
[[File:Chaitanya-Mahabrabhu-at-Jagannath.jpg|thumb|right|x195px|Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]
{{main article|Achintya Bhedabheda}}
[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] was the prime exponent of ''Achintya-Bheda-Abheda''.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=247}} In [[Sanskrit]] ''achintya'' means 'inconceivable'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=407}}; {{harvnb|Gupta|2007|pp=47–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Achintya-Bheda-Abheda'' represents the philosophy of "inconceivable difference in non-difference",{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=378–380}} in relation to the non-dual reality of ''Brahman''-''Atman'' which it calls (''[[Krishna]]''), ''svayam bhagavan''.{{sfn|Gupta|2016|pp=44–45}} The notion of "inconceivability" (''acintyatva'') is used to reconcile apparently contradictory notions in Upanishadic teachings. This school asserts that ''Krishna'' is ''[[Bhagavan]]'' of the ''bhakti yogins'', the ''Brahman'' of the ''jnana yogins'', and has a divine potency that is inconceivable. He is all-pervading and thus in all parts of the universe (non-difference), yet he is inconceivably more (difference). This school is at the foundation of the ''[[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]]'' religious tradition.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=378–380}}

== Vedanta philosophy ==

The important approaches followed by the most noted proponents of different schools of Vedanta are summarized below:
# To theorize that the soul (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' / ''[[Jiva|Jivātman]]'') and the physical universe (''[[Prakriti]]'') are both identical with and different from ''[[Brahman]]''. This view is held by Bhartriprapancha.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}
# To place non-dualistic ideas in the most important place, relegating dualistic ideas to an interim position. This approach is followed by Shankara.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michael Comans|1996|pp=49–71}}; {{harvnb|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–53}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2000| pp=224–228 with notes 8, 13 and 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To theorize that non-dualism is qualified by difference. This is Ramanuja's approach.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=346}}
# To emphasize dualism, discrediting and offering an alternative explanation of non-dualistic ideas. This is from Madhva.{{sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=368–374}}

Sivananda gives the following explanation:
{{quote|Madhva said, "Man is the servant of God," and established his Dvaita philosophy. Ramanuja said, "Man is a ray or spark of God," and established his Visishtadvaita philosophy. Sankara said, "Man is identical with Brahman or the Eternal Soul," and established his Kevala Advaita philosophy.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=217}}}}

===Common features===
Despite their differences, all schools of Vedanta share some common features:
# ''Brahman'' exists as the unchanging material cause and instrumental cause of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Das|1952}};  {{harvnb|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}; {{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|p=122}}; {{harvnb|Sheridan|1991|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ''Upanishads'' are a reliable source of knowledge (''Sruti Śabda'' in [[Pramana]]);{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=34,66}} Vedanta is the pursuit of knowledge into the ''Brahman'' and the ''Ātman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2002|pp=34,66}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Belief in rebirth and the desirability of release from the cycle of rebirths, ''(mokşa)''.{{sfn|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}
# The self  (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' / ''[[Jiva|Jivātman]]'') is the agent of its own acts ([[karma]]) and the recipient of the consequences of these actions.{{sfn|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}
# Rejection of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] and conclusions of the other Vedic schools (Nyaya, Vaisheshika, [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], and, to some extent, the [[Purva Mimamsa]].){{sfn|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}

===Metaphysics===
Vedanta philosophies discuss three fundamental metaphysical categories and the relations between the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raju|1972|pp=176–177, 505–506}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}; {{harvnb|Fowler|2002|pp=49–59, 254, 269, 294–295, 345}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Ishvara]]'': the ultimate reality&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Das|1952}}; {{harvnb|Puligandla|1997|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' or ''[[Jiva|Jivātman]]'': the individual soul, self&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2009|p='see entry for Atman(self)'}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Prakṛti|Prakriti]]''/''Jagat'':&lt;ref name="Washington"/&gt; the empirical world, ever–changing physical universe, body and matter&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lipner|1986|pp=40–41,51–56,144}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=23,78,158–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brahman / Ishvara - Conceptions of the Supreme Reality ====
Shankara, in formulating Advaita, talks of two conceptions of ''Brahman'': the higher ''Brahman'' as undifferentiated Being, and a lower ''Brahman'' endowed with qualities as the creator of the universe.{{sfn|Chari|1988|pp=2,383}}
# ''Parā'' or Higher ''Brahman'':  the undifferentiated, absolute, infinite, transcendental, supra-relational Brahman beyond all thought and speech is defined as ''parā'' ''Brahman'', ''nirviśeṣa'' Brahman or ''nirguṇa'' Brahman and is the Absolute of metaphysics.
# ''Aparā'' or Lower ''Brahman'': the ''[[Brahman]]'' with qualities defined as ''aparā'' ''Brahman'' or ''saguṇa'' ''Brahman''. The ''saguṇa'' ''Brahman'' is endowed with attributes and represents the personal God of religion.

Ramanuja, in formulating Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, rejects ''nirguṇa''—that the undifferentiated Absolute is inconceivable—and adopts a theistic interpretation of the ''Upanishads'', accepts ''Brahman'' as ''Ishvara'', the personal God who is the seat of all auspicious attributes, as the One reality. The God of Vishishtadvaita is accessible to the devotee, yet remains the Absolute, with differentiated attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2002|p=317}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=2,383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhva, in expounding Dvaita philosophy, maintains that ''[[Vishnu]]'' is the supreme God, thus identifying the ''Brahman'', or absolute reality, of the ''Upanishads'' with a personal god, as Ramanuja had done before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britannica|2016}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nimbarka, in his dvaitadvata philosophy, accepted the ''Brahman'' both as ''nirguṇa'' and as ''saguṇa''. Vallabha, in his shuddhadvaita philosophy, not only accepts the triple ontological essence of the ''Brahman'', but also His manifestation as personal God (''Ishvara''), as matter and as individual souls.{{sfn|Vitsaxis|2009|pp=100–101}}

==== Relation between Brahman and Jiva / Atman ====
The schools of Vedanta differ in their conception of the relation they see between ''Ātman'' / ''Jivātman'' and ''Brahman'' / ''Ishvara'':{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=177}}
* According to Advaita Vedanta, ''Ātman'' is identical with ''Brahman'' and there is no difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raju|1972|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Vishishtadvaita, ''Jīvātman'' is different from ''Ishvara'', though eternally connected with Him as His mode.{{sfn|Ādidevānanda|2014|pp=9-10}} The oneness of the Supreme Reality is understood in the sense of an organic unity (''vishistaikya''). ''Brahman'' / ''Ishvara'' alone, as organically related to all ''Jīvātman'' and the material universe is the one Ultimate Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Betty|2010|pp=215–224}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=2,383}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Dvaita, the ''Jīvātman'' is totally and always different from ''Brahman'' / ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Craig|2000|pp=517–18}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}; {{harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=361–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Shuddhadvaita (pure monism), the ''Jīvātman'' and ''Brahman'' are identical; both, along with the changing empirically-observed universe being [[Krishna]].{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}}

===Epistemology===
{{main article|Pramana}}
[[File:3 Pramana Epistemology Dualistic Dvaita Vishishtadvaita Hindu schools.svg|thumb|180px|Epistemology in Dvaita and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. Advaita and some other Vedanta schools recognize six epistemic means.]]

==== Pramana ====
''Pramāṇa'' ([[Sanskrit]]: प्रमाण) literally means "proof", "that which is the means of valid knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|pp=520–521}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=73–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to [[epistemology]] in Indian philosophies, and encompasses the study of reliable and valid means by which human beings gain accurate, true knowledge.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2000|pp=520–521}} The focus of [[Pramana]] is the manner in which correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows or does not know, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2002|pp=25–26}}; {{harvnb|Bhawuk|2011|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient and medieval Indian texts identify six{{Refn|group=note|A few Indian scholars such as Vedvyasa discuss ten, Krtakoti discusses eight, but six is most widely accepted; see {{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|pp=149–150}}}} ''pramanas'' as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bhawuk|2011|p=172}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=73–76}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception)
# ''Anumāṇa'' (inference)
# ''[[Upamāṇa]]'' (comparison and analogy)
# ''Arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances)
# ''Anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof)
# ''[[Śabda]]'' (scriptural testimony/ verbal testimony of past or present reliable experts).
The different schools of Vedanta have historically disagreed as to which of the six are epistemologically valid. For example, while Advaita Vedanta accepts all six ''pramanas'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimes|2006|p=238}}; {{harvnb|Puligandla|1997|p=228}}; {{harvnb|Clayton|2006|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita accept only three ''pramanas'' (perception, inference and testimony).{{sfn|Grimes|2006|p=238}}

Advaita considers ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception) as the most reliable source of knowledge, and ''[[Śabda]]'', the scriptural evidence, is considered secondary except for matters related to Brahman, where it is the only evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Indich|1995|pp=65}}; {{harvnb|Gupta|1995|pp=137–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|Anantanand {{harvtxt|Rambachan|1991|pp=xii–xiii}} states, "According to these [widely represented contemporary] studies, Shankara only accorded a provisional validity to the knowledge gained by inquiry into the words of the [[Śruti]] (Vedas) and did not see the latter as the unique source (''pramana'') of ''Brahmajnana''. The affirmations of the Śruti, it is argued, need to be verified and confirmed by the knowledge gained through direct experience (''anubhava'') and the authority of the Śruti, therefore, is only secondary." Sengaku {{harvtxt|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–47}} concurs, adding Shankara maintained the need for objectivity in the process of gaining knowledge (''vastutantra''), and considered subjective opinions (''purushatantra'') and injunctions in Śruti (''codanatantra'') as secondary. Mayeda cites Shankara's explicit statements emphasizing epistemology (''pramana–janya'') in section 1.18.133 of Upadesasahasri and section 1.1.4 of Brahmasutra–bhasya.}} In Vishistadvaita and Dvaita, ''[[Śabda]]'', the scriptural testimony, is considered the most authentic means of knowledge instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2002|p=304}}; {{harvnb|Puligandla|1997|pp=208–211, 237–239}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|pp=147–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Theories of cause and effect ====
All schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of ''Satkāryavāda'',{{sfn|Nicholson}} which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are two different views on the status of the "effect", that is, the world. Most schools of Vedanta, as well as Samkhya, support ''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Parinamavada]]'', the idea that the world is a real transformation (''parinama'') of Brahman.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} According to {{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}, "the ''Brahma Sutras'' espouse the realist Parinamavada position, which appears to have been the view most common among early Vedantins". In contrast to Badarayana, Adi Shankara and Advaita Vedantists hold a different view, ''[[Vivartavada]]'', which says that the effect, the world, is merely an unreal (''vivarta'') transformation of its cause, Brahman.{{Refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} writes of Advaita Vedantin position of cause and effect - Although Brahman seems to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are essentially unreal, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts.}}

==Influence==

=== Hindu traditions ===
Vedanta, adopting ideas from other [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools, became the most prominent school of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}; {{harvnb|Clooney|2000|pp=96–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vedanta traditions led to the development of many traditions in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooks|1990|pp=20–22,77–79}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=231,232,238}}; {{harvnb|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Vaishnavism]] of south and southeastern India is based on Ramanuja's ''Vishishtadvaita'' Vedanta.{{Sfn|Carman|Narayanan|1989|pp=3–4}} Ramananda led to the ''Vaishnav Bhakti'' Movement in north, east, central and west India. This movement draws its philosophical and theistic basis from ''Vishishtadvaita''. A large number of devotional ''Vaishnavism'' traditions of east India, north India (particularly the Braj region), west and central India are based on various sub-schools of ''Bhedabheda'' Vedanta.{{sfn|Nicholson}} ''Advaita'' Vedanta influenced ''Krishna Vaishnavism'' in the northeastern state of [[Assam]].{{sfn|Neog|1980|pp=243–244}} The Madhva school of Vaishnavism found in coastal [[Karnataka]] is based on ''Dvaita'' Vedanta.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=372–375}}

''[[Āgama (Hinduism)|Āgamas]]'', the classical literature of ''[[Shaivism]]'', though independent in origin, show Vedanta association and premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2003|pp=126–128}}; {{harvnb|Klostermaier|1984|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 92 ''Āgamas'', ten are (''[[dvaita]]'') texts, eighteen (''[[bhedabheda]]''), and sixty-four (''[[advaita]]'') texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2014|p=167 note 21}}; {{harvnb|Dyczkowski|1989|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Bhairava Shastras'' are monistic, ''Shiva Shastras'' are dualistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vasugupta|2012|pp=252, 259}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=162–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Isaeva|1995|pp=134–135}} finds the link between Gaudapada's ''Advaita'' Vedanta and ''[[Kashmir Shaivism]]'' evident and natural. [[Tirumular]], the Tamil ''Shaiva Siddhanta'' scholar, credited with creating "Vedanta–Siddhanta" (Advaita Vedanta and Shaiva Siddhanta synthesis), stated, "becoming ''Shiva'' is the goal of Vedanta and ''Siddhanta''; all other goals are secondary to it and are vain."{{sfn|Manninezhath|1993|pp=xv, 31}}

''[[Shaktism]]'', or traditions where a goddess is considered identical to ''[[Brahman]]'', has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of ''Advaita'' Vedanta and dualism premises of ''Samkhya–Yoga'' school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as ''Shaktadavaitavada'' (literally, the path of nondualistic ''Shakti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDaniel|2004|pp=89–91}}; {{harvnb|Brooks|1990|pp=35–39}}; {{harvnb|Mahony|1997|p=274 with note 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Vedanta===

Neo-Vedanta, variously called as "Hindu modernism", "neo-Hinduism", and "neo-Advaita", is a term that denotes some novel interpretations of [[Hinduism]] that developed in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1999|p=135}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=258}}; {{harvnb|King|2002|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably as a reaction to the colonial British rule.{{sfn|King|1999|pp=187,135—142}} {{harvtxt|King|2002|pp=129–135}} writes that these notions accorded the Hindu nationalists an opportunity to attempt the construction of a nationalist ideology to help unite the Hindus to fight colonial oppression. Western [[Orientalism|orientalists]], in their search for its "essence", attempted to formulate a notion of "Hinduism" based on a single interpretation of Vedanta as a unified body of religious praxis.{{sfn|King|2002|p=118}} This was contra-factual as, historically, Hinduism and Vedanta had always accepted a diversity of traditions. {{harvtxt|King|1999|pp=133–136}} asserts that the neo-Vedantic theory of "overarching tolerance and acceptance" was used by the Hindu reformers, together with the ideas of [[Universalism in religion|Universalism]] and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]], to challenge the polemic dogmatism of Judaeo-Christian-Islamic missionaries against the Hindus.

The neo-Vedantins argued that the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy were perspectives on a single truth, all valid and complementary to each other.{{Sfn|King|1999|p=137}}  {{harvtxt|Halbfass|2007|p=307}} sees these interpretations as incorporating western ideas{{sfn|Halbfass|2007|p=307}} into traditional systems, especially [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} It is the modern form of Advaita Vedanta, states {{harvtxt|King|1999|p=135}}, the neo-Vedantists subsumed the Buddhist philosophies as part of the Vedanta tradition{{refn|group=note|Vivekananda, clarifies Richard King, stated, "I am not a Buddhist, as you have heard, and yet I am"; but thereafter Vivekananda explained that "he cannot accept the Buddhist rejection of a self, but nevertheless honors the Buddha's compassion and attitude towards others".{{sfn|King|1999|p=138}}}} and then argued that all the world religions are same "non-dualistic position as the philosophia perennis", ignoring the differences within and outside of Hinduism.{{sfn|King|1999|pp=133–136}} According to {{harvtxt|Gier|2000|p=140}}, neo-Vedanta is Advaita Vedanta which accepts universal realism:{{quote|Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and Aurobindo have been labeled neo-Vedantists (the latter called it realistic Advaita), a view of Vedanta that rejects the Advaitins' idea that the world is illusory. As Aurobindo phrased it, philosophers need to move from 'universal illusionism' to 'universal realism', in the strict philosophical sense of assuming the world to be fully real.}}

A major proponent in the popularization of this Universalist and Perennialist interpretation of Advaita Vedanta was [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|King|2002|pp=135–142}} who played a major role in the [[Hindu nationalism|revival of Hinduism]].{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} He was also instrumental in the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the West via the [[Vedanta Society]], the international arm of the [[Ramakrishna Order]].{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}

==== Criticism of Neo-Vedanta label ====
{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=2}} writes that the attempts at integration which came to be known as neo-Vedanta were evident as early as between the 12th and the 16th century−  {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the "six systems" (''saddarsana'') of mainstream Hindu philosophy.{{refn|group=note|The tendency of "a blurring of philosophical distinctions" has also been noted by Burley.{{sfn|Burley|2007|p=34}} Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus,{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=24–33}} and a process of "mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other",{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=27}} which started well before 1800.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=26–27}}}}}}[[Bimal Krishna Matilal|Matilal]] criticizes Neo-Hinduism as an oddity developed by West-inspired Western Indologists and attributes it to the flawed Western perception of Hinduism in modern India. In his scathing criticism of this school of reasoning, {{harvtxt|Matilal|2002|pp=403–404}} says:{{quote|The so-called 'traditional' outlook is in fact a construction. Indian history shows that the tradition itself was self-conscious and critical of itself, sometimes overtly and sometimes covertly. It was never free from internal tensions due to the inequalities that persisted in a hierarchical society, nor was it without confrontation and challenge throughout its history. Hence Gandhi, Vivekananda and Tagore were not simply 'transplants from Western culture, products arising solely from confrontation with the west.

...It is rather odd that, although the early Indologists' romantic dream of discovering a pure (and probably primitive, according to some) form of Hinduism (or Buddhism as the case may be) now stands discredited in many quarters; concepts like neo-Hinduism are still bandied about as substantial ideas or faultless explanation tools by the Western 'analytic' historians as well as the West-inspired historians of India.}}

=== Influence on Western thinkers ===
An exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia since the late 18th century as a result of colonization of parts of Asia by Western powers. This also influenced western religiosity. The first translation of ''Upanishads'', published in two parts in 1801 and 1802, significantly influenced [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who called them the consolation of his life.{{sfn|Renard|2010|pp=177—178}} He drew explicit parallels between his philosophy, as set out in ''The World as Will and Representation'',&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. ''The World as Will and Representation''. Translated from the German by EFJ Payne. Dover Publications, vol. 1, chap. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that of the Vedanta philosophy as described in the work of Sir William Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Sir William. ''On the Philosophy of the Asiatics''. Sir William Jones. Asiatic Researches, vol. 4, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}} Influenced by Śaṅkara's concepts of ''Brahman'' (God) and ''māyā'' (illusion), [[Lucian Blaga]] often used the concepts ''marele anonim'' (the Great Anonymous) and ''cenzura transcendentă'' (the transcendental censorship) in his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2007), ''Marele Anonim şi cenzura transcendentă la Blaga. Brahman şi māyā la Śaṅkara'', in ''Caiete critice'' 6–7 (236–237), Bucharest, ISSN|1220-6350, pp. 75–83.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
According to {{harvtxt|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}, the Vedanta school has had a historic and central influence on Hinduism:
{{Quote|The prevalence of Vedanta thought is found not only in philosophical writings but also in various forms of ([[Hindu]]) literature, such as the epics, lyric poetry, drama and so forth. ...the Hindu religious sects, the common faith of the Indian populace, looked to Vedanta philosophy for the theoretical foundations for their theology. The influence of Vedanta is prominent in the sacred literatures of Hinduism, such as the various Puranas, Samhitas, Agamas and Tantras...{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}}}

[[Frithjof Schuon]] summarizes the influence of Vedanta on Hinduism as follows:
{{Quote|The Vedanta contained in the Upanishads, then formulated in the ''Brahma Sutra'', and finally commented and explained by Shankara, is an invaluable key for discovering the deepest meaning of all the religious doctrines and for realizing that the ''[[Sanatana Dharma]]'' secretly penetrates all the forms of traditional spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Witz|1998|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Schuon|1975|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{harvtxt|Flood|1996|pp=231–232, 238}} states,
{{Quote|..the most influential school of theology in India has been Vedanta, exerting enormous influence on all religious traditions and becoming the central ideology of the Hindu renaissance in the nineteenth century. It has become the philosophical paradigm of Hinduism "par excellence".}}

==Similarities with Spinoza's philosophy==
German Sanskritist [[Theodore Goldstücker]] was among the early scholars to notice similarities between the religious conceptions of the Vedanta and those of the Dutch Jewish philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]], writing that Spinoza's thought was
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines [...] comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Goldstucker, ''Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker'', W. H. Allen, 1879. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Max Müller]] noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying,
{{quote|The Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'."&lt;ref&gt;Three Lectures on the Vedanta Philosophy. F. Max Muller. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay,
{{quote|sign=|source=|As to Spinoza's Deity—''natura naturans''—conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity—as ''natura naturata'' or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct outflowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple.&lt;ref&gt;H.P Blavatsky's Collected Writings, Volume 13, pages 308-310. Quest Books&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''women's liberation movement''' ('''WLM''') was a political alignment of women and [[feminism|feminist]] [[intellectualism]] that emerged in the late 1960s and continued into the 1980s primarily in the industrialized nations of the Western world, which effected great change (political, intellectual, cultural) throughout the world. The WLM branch of [[Radical feminism]], based in [[contemporary philosophy]], comprised women of racially- and culturally-diverse backgrounds who proposed that economic, psychological, and social freedom were necessary for women to progress from being second-class citizens in their societies.{{sfn|''New Fontana''|1999|pp=314}}

Towards achieving the equality of women, the WLM questioned the cultural and legal validity of [[patriarchy]] and the practical validity of the social and sexual [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] used to control and limit the legal and physical independence of women in society. Women's liberationists proposed that [[sexism]] — legalised formal and informal sex-based discrimination predicated on the existence of the social construction of gender — was the principal political problem with the power dynamics of their societies. In general, the WLM proposed socio-economic change from the [[Left-wing politics|political Left]], rejected the idea that piece-meal equality, within and according to [[social class]], would eliminate sexual discrimination against women, and fostered the tenets of [[humanism]], especially the respect for [[human rights]] of all people. In the decades during which the Women's Liberation Movement flourished, liberationists successfully changed how women were perceived in their cultures, redefined the socio-economic and the political roles of women in society, and transformed mainstream society.{{sfn|''New Fontana''|1999|pp=315}}
{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Suffrage}}

== Background ==
The [[Social cycle theory|wave theory of social development]] holds that intense periods of social activity are followed by periods of remission, in which the activists involved intensely in mobilization are systematically marginalized and isolated.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=762}} After the intense period fighting for [[women's suffrage]], the common interest which had united international feminists left the women's movement without a single focus upon which all could agree. Ideological differences between radicals and moderates, led to a split and a period of deradicalization, with the largest group of women's activists spearheading movements to educate women on their new responsibilities as voters. Organizations like the [[African National Congress Women's League]],{{sfn|Walker|1991|p=83}} the [[Irish Housewives Association]],{{sfn|Connolly|1997|p=109}} the [[League of Women Voters]], the [[Townswomen's Guild]]s and the [[Women's Institutes]] supported women and tried to educate them on how to use their new rights to incorporate themselves into the established political system.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|pp=763–764}}{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=5}} Still other organizations, involved in the mass movement of women into the work force during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] and their subsequent exit at the end of the war with concerted official efforts to return to family life, turned their efforts to labor issues.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=764}} The [[World YWCA]] and [[Zonta International]], were leaders in these efforts, mobilizing women to gather information on the situation of working women and organize assistance programs.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=175}}{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}} Increasingly, radical organizations, like the American [[National Women's Party]], were marginalized, by media which denounced feminism and its proponents as "severe neurotics responsible for the problems of" society. Those who were still attached to the radical themes of equality were typically unmarried, employed, socially and economically advantaged and seemed to the larger society to be deviant.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=765}}

In countries throughout Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South America efforts to decolonize and replace authoritarian regimes, which largely began in the 1950s and stretched through the 1980s, initially saw the state overtaking the role of radical feminists. For example, in Egypt, the 1956 Constitution eliminated gender barriers to labour, political access, and education through provisions for gender equality.{{sfn|Al-Ali|2002|p=8}} Women in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Nicaragua and other [[Latin America]]n countries had worked for an end to dictatorships in their countries. As those governments turned to socialist policies, the state aimed to eliminate gender inequality through state action.{{sfn|Russell|2012|p=19}} As ideology in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean shifted left, women in newly independent and still colonized countries saw a common goal in fighting imperialism. They focused their efforts to address gendered power imbalances in their quest for respect of human rights and nationalist goals.{{sfn|Armstrong|2016|p=305}}{{sfn|Sanatan|2016}}{{sfn|Neptune|2011}} This worldwide movement towards decolonization and the realignment of international politics into [[Cold War]] camps after the end of World War II, usurped the drive for women's enfranchisement, as universal suffrage and nationhood became the goal for activists.{{sfn|Rubio-Marín|2014}} A Pan-African awareness and global recognition of blackness as a unifying point for struggle, led to a recognition by numerous marginalized groups that there was potential to politicize their oppression.{{sfn|Bagneris|2011|p=4}}

In their attempt to influence these newly independent countries to align with the United States, in the polarized Cold War climate, [[racism]] in U.S. policy became a stumbling block to the foreign policy objective to become the dominant [[superpower]]. Black leaders were aware of the favorable climate for securing change and pushed forward the [[Civil Rights Movement]] to address racial inequalities.{{sfn|Morris|1999|pp=522–524}} They sought to eliminate the damage of oppression, using [[Liberation psychology|liberation theory]] and a movement which sought to create societal transformation in the way people thought about others by infusing the disenfranchised with political power to change the power structures.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=1}} The [[Black Power movement]] and global student movements protested the apparent double standards of the age and the authoritarian nature of social institutions.{{sfn|Barker|2008|pp=44–45, 50}} From [[Czechoslovakia]] to [[Mexico 68|Mexico]], in diverse locations like Germany, France, Italy, and Japan, among others, students protested the civil, economic and political inequalities, as well as involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Barker|2008|pp=48–50}} Many of the activists participating in these causes would go on to participate in the feminist movement.{{sfn|Bullock|2010|p=4}}

Socially, the [[Baby boomers|baby boom]] experienced after World War II, the relative worldwide economic growth in the post-war years, the expansion of the television industry sparking improved communications, as well as access to higher education for both women and men led to an awareness of the social problems women faced and the need for a cultural change.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=16}} At the time, women were economically dependent on men and neither the concept of [[patriarchy]] nor a coherent theory about the power relationships between men and women in society existed.{{sfn|Bradshaw|2013|pp=391–392}} If they worked, positions available to women were typically in light manufacturing or agricultural work and a limited segment of positions in the service industries, such as bookkeeping, domestic labor, nursing, secretarial and clerical work, retail sales, or school teaching.{{sfn|Cheal|2003|p=70}}{{sfn|Backhouse|Flaherty|1992|pp=218–219}} They were expected to work for lower wages than men and upon marriage, terminate their employment.{{sfn|Mioko|1978|p=77}}{{sfn|Cheal|2003|p=70}}{{sfn|Backhouse|Flaherty|1992|pp=218–219}} Women were unable to obtain bank accounts or credit, making renting housing impossible, without a man's consent. In many countries they were not allowed to go into public spaces without a male chaperone.{{sfn|Enke|2007|p=6}}

Married women from countries founded the British colonial system and thus with a legal code based on English law were legally bound to have sex with their husbands upon demand. Marital rape was not a concept, as under law women had given consent to regular intercourse upon marrying.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=2}} The state and church, placed enormous pressure on young women to retain their virginity. Introduction of the pill, gave many men a sense that as women could not get pregnant, they could not say no to intercourse.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=3}} Though by the 1960s the pill was widely available, prescription was tightly controlled and in many countries, dissemination of information about birth control was illegal.{{sfn|Nilsson|Spencer|2015}} Even after the pill was legalized, contraception remained banned in numerous countries, like Ireland where condoms were banned and the pill could only be prescribed to control menstrual cycles.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=46}} The Catholic Church issued the encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' in 1968, reiterating the ban on [[Birth control|artificial contraception]].{{sfn |Rengel|2000|p=202}} Abortion often required the consent of a spouse,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=241}} or approval by a board, like in Canada, wherein the decisions often revolved around whether pregnancy posed a threat to the woman's health or life.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|pp=469–470}}

As women became more educated and joined the work force, their home responsibilities remained largely unchanged. Though families increasingly depended on dual incomes, women carried most of the responsibility for domestic work and care of children.{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|pp=37–38}} There had long been recognition by society in general of the inequalities in civil, socio-economic, and political agency between women and men. However, the Women's Liberation Movement was the first time that the idea of challenging [[sexism]] gained wide acceptance.{{sfn|Bucy|2010|p=306}} Literature on sex, such as the [[Kinsey Reports]], and the development and distribution of the [[birth control pill]], created a climate wherein women began to question the authority others wielded over their decisions regarding their bodies and their morality.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=17}} Many of the women who participated in the movement, were aligned with leftist politics and after 1960, with the development of Cold War polarization, took their inspiration from [[Maoist theory]]. Slogans such as "workers of the world unite" turned into "women of the world unite" and key features like consciousness-raising and egalitarian consensus-based policies "were inspired by similar techniques used in China".{{sfn|Hathaway|2018}}{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=136-137}}

Into this backdrop of world events, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] published ''[[The Second Sex]]'' in 1949, which was translated into English in 1952. In the book, de Beauvoir put forward the idea that equality did not require women be masculine to become empowered.{{sfn|Bergoffen|2004}} With her famous statement, "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman", she laid the groundwork for the concept of [[gender]] as a social construct, as opposed to a biological trait.{{sfn|Butler|1986|p=35}} The same year, [[Margaret Mead]] published ''[[Male and Female (book)|Male and Female]]'', which though it analyzed primitive societies of New Guinea, showed that gendered activities varied between cultures and that biology had no role in defining which tasks were performed by men or women. By 1965, de Beauvoir and Mead's works had been translated into Danish and became widely influential with feminists.{{sfn|Larsen|2014}}{{sfn|Tobias|1997}}  [[Kurahashi Yumiko]] published her debut ''Partei'' in 1960, which critically examined the student movement.{{sfn|Bullock|2010|p=13}} The work started a trend in Japan of feminist works which challenged the opportunities available to women and mocked conventional power dynamics in Japanese society.{{sfn|Bullock|2010|pp=50–51}} In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]] published ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', voicing the discontent felt by American women.{{sfn|Fox|2006}}

== Aims ==
As the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement emerged from the [[Abolitionism|Abolition Movement]], the Women's Liberation Movement grew out of the struggle for civil rights.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}}{{sfn|''The Dayton Daily News''|1969|p=11}} Though challenging patriarchy and the anti-patriarchal message of the Women's Liberation Movement was considered radical, it was not the only, nor the first, radical movement in the early period of [[second-wave feminism]].{{sfn|Thompson|2002|pp=344–345}} Rather than simply desiring legal equality, those participating in the movement believed that the moral and social climate which perceived women as second-class citizens needed to change. Though most groups operated independently—there were no national umbrella organizations—there were unifying philosophies of women participating in the movement. Challenging patriarchy and the hierarchical organization of society which defined women as subordinate in both public and private spheres, liberationists believed that women should be free to define their own individual identity as part of human society.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}}{{sfn|''The Dayton Daily News''|1969|p=11}}{{sfn|Studer|2017|p=15-16}}

One of the reasons that women who supported the movement chose not to create a single approach to addressing the problem of women being treated as second-class citizens was that they did not want to foster an idea that anyone was an expert or that any one group or idea could address all of the societal problems women faced.{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}} They also wanted women, whose voices had been silenced to be able to express their own views on solutions.{{sfn|Bennett|1970|p=40}} Rejecting authority and espousing participatory democracy as well as direct action, they promoted a wide agenda including civil rights, eliminating objectification of women, ethnic empowerment, granting women reproductive rights, increasing opportunities for women in the workplace, peace, and redefining familial roles, as well as gay and lesbian liberation.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}} A dilemma faced by movement members was how they could challenge the definition of femininity without compromising the principals of feminism.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}}{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=466}}

Women's historical participation in the world was virtually unknown, even to trained historians.{{sfn|Myrbråten|2013|p=20-21}}{{sfn|DuBois|1998|p=10}} Women's roles in historic events were not covered in academic texts and not taught in schools. Even the fact that women had been denied the vote was something few university students were aware of in the era.{{sfn|Lee|2014}}{{sfn|Hannam|2008}} To understand the wider implications of women's experiences, WLM groups launched [[women's studies]] programs introducing feminist history, sociology and psychology to higher education and adult education curricula to counter gender biases in teaching these subjects.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=76-77}} Writing women back into history became extremely important in the period with attention to the differences of experiences based on class, ethnic background, race and sexual orientation.{{sfn|Hannam|2008}} The courses became widespread by the end of the decade in Britain, Canada and the United States, and were also introduced in such places as Italy and Norway.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=76-77}}

Thousands of adherents joined the movement which began in the United States{{sfn|Enke|2007|p=2}} and spread to Canada and Mexico.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=466}}{{sfn|González Alvarado|2002|p=56}} In Europe, movements developed in Austria{{sfn|''Der Funke''|2003}} Belgium,{{sfn|Jacques|2013}} Denmark,{{sfn|Dahlerup|2017}} England,{{sfn|Barber, et al.|2013}} France,{{sfn|Picq|2008}} Germany,{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015}} Greece,{{sfn|''Greek News Agenda''|2017}} Iceland,{{sfn|Haavio-Mannila|Skard|2013|p=27}} Ireland,{{sfn|Cosgrove|2008|p=882}} Italy,{{sfn|Radical Party Archive|1972}} The Netherlands,{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}} Northern Ireland,{{sfn|Aughey|Morrow|2014|p=173}} Norway,{{sfn|Haavio-Mannila|Skard|2013|p=28}} Portugal,{{sfn|Pena|2008}} Scotland,{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=4}} Spain,{{sfn|Morgan|1984|p=626}} Sweden,{{sfn|Haavio-Mannila|Skard|2013|p=28}} Switzerland{{sfn|Joris|2008}} and Wales.{{sfn|Rolph|2002}} The liberationist movement also was active in Australia,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=25–26}} Fiji,{{sfn|Griffen|Yee|1987|p=1}} Guam,{{sfn|''The Ladder''|1972|p=47}} India,{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=40}} Israel,{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=150}} Japan,{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=ix}} New Zealand,{{sfn|Cook|2011}} Singapore,{{sfn|Lyons|2000}} South Korea,{{sfn|Kim|2000|pp=220-221}} and Taiwan.{{sfn|Chiang|Liu|2011|p=559}}

Key components of the movement were [[consciousness-raising]] sessions aimed at politicizing personal issues,{{sfn|Spain|2016|p=51}}{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|pp=468–469}} small group and limited organizational structure{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=29–30}} and a focus on changing societal perception rather than reforming legislation.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}} For example, liberationists did not support reforming family codes to allow abortion, instead, they believed that neither medical professionals nor the state should have the power to limit women's complete control of their own bodies.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=85}} They favored abolishing laws which limited women's rights over their reproduction, believing such control was an individual right, not subject to moralistic majority views.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=108}} Most liberationists banned the participation of men in their organizations.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=27–28}}{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=467}} Though often depicted in media as a sign of "man-hating", separation was a focused attempt to eliminate defining women via their relationship to men. Since women's inequality within their employment, family and society were commonly experienced by all women, separation meant unity of purpose to evaluate their second-class status.{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|p=8}}

== Development ==
=== North America ===
{{Main|Women's liberation movement in North America}}
In Canada and the United States, the movement developed out of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Anti-War sentiment toward the Vietnam War, the [[Indigenous rights|Native Rights Movement]] and the [[New Left]] student movement of the 1960s.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=466}}{{sfn|Sklar|2015}}{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|p=39}} Between 1965 and 1966, papers presented at meetings of the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] and articles published in journals, such as the Canadian ''Random'' began advocating for women to embark on a path of self-discovery free from male scrutiny.{{sfn|Yates|1975|p=7}} In 1967, the first Women's Liberation organizations formed in major cities like Berkeley, Boston, Chicago, New York City and Toronto.{{sfn|Yates|1975|pp=7–8}} Quickly organizations spread across both countries.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|pp=466–469}}{{sfn|Freeman|1972}} In Mexico, the first group of liberationists formed in 1970, inspired by the [[Mexico 68|student movement]] and US women's liberationists.{{sfn|González Alvarado|2002|p=56}}{{sfn|''El Universal''|2012}}

Organizations were loosely organized, without a hierarchical power structure and favored all-women participation to eliminate defining women or their autonomy by their association with men.{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|p=8}} Groups featured consciousness raising discussions on a wide variety of issues, the importance of having freedom to make choices, and the importance of changing societal attitudes and perceptions of women's roles.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=20}}{{sfn|Kanes|1969|p=11}} Canadian Women's Lib groups typically incorporated a class-based component into their theory of oppression which was mostly missing from U.S. liberation theory, {{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|pp=468–469}}{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|p=50}} which focused almost exclusively on sexism and a belief that women's oppression stemmed from their gender and not as a result of their economic or social class.{{sfn|Echols|1989|p=3}} In Quebec, women's and Quebec's autonomy were entwined issues with women struggling for the right to serve as jurors.{{sfn|Dupuis-Déri|2007}}

Advocating public self-expression by participating in protests and sit-ins, liberationists demonstrated against discriminatory hiring and wage practices in Canada,{{sfn|Wasserlein|1990|p=64}} while in the US liberationists protested the [[Miss America]] Beauty Pageant for objectifying women.{{sfn|Bucy|2010|p=307}} In both countries Women's Liberation groups were involved protesting their legislators for abortion rights for women.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=472}}{{sfn|Nelson|2003|pp=33–34}} In Mexico liberationists protested at the Monument to the Mother on [[Mother's Day]] to challenge the idea that all women were destined to be mothers.{{sfn|''El Universal''|2012}}{{sfn|González Alvarado|2002|p=58}} Challenging gender definitions and the sexual relationship to power drew lesbians into the movement in both the United States and Canada.{{sfn|Tremblay|Paternotte|Johnson|2016|p=75}} Because liberationists believed that sisterhood was a uniting component to women's oppression, lesbians were not seen as a threat to other women.{{sfn|Brownmiller|1970}} Another important aspect for North American women was developing spaces for women to meet with other women, offer counseling and referral services, provide access to feminist materials, and establish [[women's shelter]]s for women who were in abusive relationships.{{sfn|Spain|2016|p=51}}{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|pp=45, 56}}{{sfn|González Alvarado|2002|p=60}}

Increasingly mainstream media portrayed liberationists as man-haters or deranged outcasts.{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|p=70}}{{sfn|Brownmiller|1970}} To gain legitimacy for the recognition of sexual discrimination, the media discourse on women's issues was increasingly shaped by the [[liberal feminist]]'s reformist aims.{{sfn|Dow|2014|pp=121–122}} As liberationists were marginalized, they increasingly became involved in single focus issues, such as violence against women. By the mid-1970s, the Women's Liberation Movement had been effective in changing the worldwide perception of women, bringing sexism to light and moving reformists far to the left in their policy aims for women,{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=91–92}} but in the haste to distance themselves from the more radical elements, liberal feminists attempted to erase their success and rebrand the movement as the Women's Movement.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=5}}

=== Europe ===
{{Main|Women's liberation movement in Europe}}
In Europe, the women's liberation movement started in the late 1960s and continued through the 1980s. Inspired by events in North America and triggered by the growing presence of women in the labour market, the movement soon gained momentum in Britain and the Scandinavian countries.{{sfn|Dahlerup|2017}} Though influenced by leftist politics, liberationists in general were resistant to any political order which ignored women entirely or relegated their issues to the sidelines.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=20}} Women's liberation groups in Europe were distinguished from other feminist activists by their focus on women's rights to control their own bodies and sexuality, as well as their direct actions aimed at provoking the public and making society aware of the issues faced by women.{{sfn|Kiani|2017|p=19}}

There were robust Women's Liberation movements in Western European countries, including developments in Greece, Portugal and Spain, which in the period  were emerging from dictatorships.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=116}} Many different types of actions were held throughout Europe.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=120}} To increase public awareness of the problems of equal pay, liberationists in Denmark staged a bus sit in, where they demanded lower fares than male passengers to demonstrate their wage gap.{{sfn|Fauré|2004|p=668}} Swedish members of ''[[Group 8 (Sweden)|Grupp 8]]'' heckled politicians at campaign rallies, demanding to know why women were only allowed part-time jobs and thus were ineligible for pensions.{{sfn|Harr|2014}} To address the objectification of women, Belgian liberationists protested at beauty pageants,{{sfn|Degavre|Stoffel|2005}} ''[[Dolle Mina]]s'' in the Netherlands and ''Nyfeministene'' of Norway invaded male-only bars,{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}}{{sfn|Nørve|2007}} [[Irish Women United]] demonstrated against male-only bathing at [[Forty Foot]] promontory{{sfn|McCabe|2010}} and Portuguese women dressed as a bride, a housewife and a sex symbol, marching in [[Eduardo VII Park]].{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=101-103}}

Women in England, Scotland and Wales led [[Reclaim the Night]] marches to challenge the notion that women's behavior caused the violence perpetrated against them.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=164-167}} Spanish liberationists from the ''Colectivo Feminista Pelvis'' (Pelvis Feminist Collective), ''Grup per l'Alliberament de la Dona'' (Group for Women's Liberation) and ''Mujeres Independientes'' (Independent Women) carried funeral wreaths through the streets of [[Mallorca]] calling for an end to sexual abuse and a judicial system which allowed men to use alcohol or [[crime of passion|passion]] as mitigating factors for sexual violence.{{sfn|Rodriguez|1979}} In Iceland, women virtually shut down the country; when spurred by liberationists, 90% of them took ''[[1975 Icelandic women's strike|Women's Day Off]]'' and refused to participate in household duties or work, instead attending a protest rally.{{sfn|Brewer|2015}}

In almost all Western European countries liberationists fought for elimination of barriers to free and unrestricted access to contraception and abortion.{{sfn|Studer|2017|p=15}}{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=123}} In Austria, to advocate for abolition of section 144 of their criminal code, activists used street theater performance.{{sfn|''Der Standard''|2004}} Prominent French activists declared their criminal actions signing the [[Manifesto of the 343]], admitting to having had abortions,{{sfn|Picq|2008}} as did German activists who signed the ''Manifesto of the 374''.{{sfn|Brown|2013|pp=300-301}} Irish activists [[Contraceptive Train|took the train]] and crossed into Northern Ireland to secure prohibited contraception devices and upon their return flouted authorities by passing the contraband to the public.{{sfn|Farren|2006}} In the UK, an uneasy alliance formed between liberationists, the [[National Abortion Campaign]] and trade unionists to fight a series of bills designed to restrict abortion rights.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=121-122}} In Italy, 50,000 women marched through the streets of Rome demanding their right to control their own bodies,{{sfn|Bracke|2014|pp=87}} but as was typically the result throughout Europe, compromise reform to existing law was passed by the government, limiting the decision by gestation or requiring preliminary medical authorization.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=124}}{{sfn|Bracke|2014|pp=87}}{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=145}}

Throughout the period, publishing was crucial for disseminating the theory and ideas of liberation and other feminist schools of thought.{{sfn|Denis|van Rokeghem|1992|pp=76-77}} Initially many activists relied on translations of material from the US,{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=47-48}}{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=38}}{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} but increasingly the focus was on producing country-specific editions, or local journals to allow activists to adapt the movement slogan the "personal is political" to reflect their own experiences.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=63-67}}{{sfn|Rees|2010|p=178}} Journals and newspapers founded by liberationists included Belgium's ''Le Petit livre rouge des femmes'' (The Little Red Book of Women),{{sfn|Denis|van Rokeghem|1992|pp=76-77}} France's ''{{ill|Le torchon brûle|fr}}'' (Waging the Battle),{{sfn|Picq|2008}} Greece's ''Gia tin Apeleftherosi ton Gynaikon'' (For the Liberation of Women),{{sfn|Greek News Agenda|2017}} Italy's ''Sottosopra'' (Upside Down),{{sfn|Melandri|2016}} the Scottish ''The Tayside Women's Liberation Newsletter'' or the British ''[[Spare Rib]]'', among many others.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=85-87}} In the UK, a [[news agency|news service]] called the [[Women's Information and Referral Service]] (WIRES) distributed news of WLM groups throughout the nation.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=85}}

Books like ''Die Klosterschule'' (The Convent School, 1968) by [[Barbara Frischmuth]], which evaluated patriarchy in the [[parochial school]]s of Austria{{sfn|Fiddler|1997|p=252}} and ''The Descent of Woman'' (1972) by Welsh author and feminist [[Elaine Morgan]], brought women into the movement who thought that their lives differed from those of women in large urban settings where the movement originated.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=17}} Other influential publications included the British edition of ''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' (1971) edited by [[Angela Phillips]] and [[Jill Rakusen]];{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=67}} ''Frauenhandbuch Nr. 1: Abtreibung und Verhütungsmittel'' (Women's Guide # 1: Abortion and Contraceptives, 1971) produced in Germany by Helke Sander and [[Verena Stefan]]{{sfn|Broeck|2007|p=100}} and ''Skylla sig själv'' (Self-blame, 1976) by Swede [[Maria-Pia Boëthius]], which evaluated [[rape culture]] applied analysis and solutions to local areas.{{sfn|Miller|2013|pp=28-29}} In some cases, books themselves became the focus of liberationists' protests over censorship, as in the case of the Norwegian demonstration at the publishing house [[Aschehoug]], which was forced to publish a translation of the Swedish text ''{{ill|Frihet, jämlikhet och systerskap|sv}}'' (Freedom, Equality and Sisterhood, 1970),{{sfn|Nørve|2007}} or the international outcry which resulted from the ban and arrest of Portuguese authors [[Maria Teresa Horta]], [[Maria Isabel Barreno]] and [[Maria Velho da Costa]] over their book ''Novas Cartas Portuguesas'' (New Portuguese Letters, 1972).{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=63-64}}{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|pp=24-26}}

As the idea of women's autonomy gained mainstream approval,{{sfn|Rúdólfsdóttir|1997|p=87}} governments and more reformist minded women's groups adopted liberationists' ideas and began incorporating them into compromise solutions.{{sfn|Sarrimo|2003}} By the early 1980s, most activists in the Women's Liberation Movements in Europe moved on to other single focus causes or transitioned into organizations which were political.{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=112-114}}{{sfn|Beccalli|1994}}{{sfn|van Oven|2005|pp=13-14}}

=== Oceania ===
{{Main|Women's liberation movement in Oceania}}
Spreading from the United States and Britain, the Women's Liberation Movement reached Oceania in 1969. The first organizations were formed in [[Sydney]] in 1969,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=25}} and by 1970 had reached [[Adelaide]] and [[Melbourne]],{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=26–27}} as well as [[Wellington]] and [[Auckland]].{{sfn|Cook|2011}} The following year, organizations were formed at the [[University of the South Pacific]] in [[Fiji]]{{sfn|Griffen|Yee|1987|p=1}} and in [[Guam]].{{sfn|''The Ladder''|1972|p=47}} As in the US and other places where the movement flourished, small consciousness-raising groups with a limited organizational structure were the norm{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=29–30}}{{sfn|Else|1993|p=65}} and the focus was on changing societal perception rather than legislation.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}}{{sfn|Else|1993|p=65}}

Involved in public protests, liberationists demonstrated at beauty pageants to protest women's objectification,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=26}}{{sfn|Else|1993|p=63}} and invaded male-only pubs.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=63}} In Australia they ran petition drives and protests in favor of legalizing abortion{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=103}} and in Auckland led a funeral procession through [[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]] to demonstrate lack of progress on issues which were of concern to women.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018}} Liberationists developed multiple publications such as ''[[Broadsheet (magazine)|Broadsheet]]'',{{sfn|Aukland Museum|n.d.}} ''Liberaction'',{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=44}} ''MeJane'',{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|pp=105–108}} ''[[Lesbian Feminist Circle|The Circle]]''{{sfn|Else|1993|p=559}} and ''Women's Liberation Newsletter''{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|pp=91–92}} to address issues and concerns;.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=44}} They founded women's shelters{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=128}}{{sfn|Cook|2011}} and women's centers for meetings and child care services,{{sfn|Else|1993|pp=96–97}}{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=131}} which were open to all women,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=27–28}} be they socialists, lesbians, indigenous women, students, workers or homemakers.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018}} The diversity of adherents fractured the movement by the early 1980s, as groups began focusing on specific interests rather than solely on sexism.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}}{{sfn|Else|1993|pp=97, 554}}

=== Asia ===
{{Main|Women's liberation movement in Asia}}
By the 1970s, the movement had spread to Asia with Women's Liberation organizations forming in Japan in 1970.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=175}} The [[Yom Kippur War]] raised awareness of the subordinate status of Israeli women, fostering the growth of the WLM.{{sfn|Herzog|2009}} In India, 1974 was a pivotal year when activists from the [[Navnirman Movement]] against corruption and the economic crisis, encouraged women to organize direct actions to challenge traditional leadership.{{sfn|Patel|1985|pp=2-3}} In 1975, liberationist ideas in South Korea were introduced by [[Yi Hyo-jae]] a professor at [[Ewha Womans University]], after she had read western texts on the movement which were first translated into Korean in 1973.{{sfn|Kim|2000|pp=220-221}} Similarly, [[Hsiu-lien Annette Lu]], who had completed her graduate courses in the United States, brought liberationist ideas to Taiwan,{{sfn|Chiang|Liu|2011|p=559}} when she returned and began publishing in the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Lu|2009|p=48}}

In Singapore and other Asian countries, conscious effort was made to distinguish their movement from decadent, "[[Sexual revolution|free sex]]" [[Feminist movement|Western feminist]] ideals,{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=176}}{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=11}}{{sfn|Menon|2011|p=24}} while simultaneously addressing issues that were experienced worldwide by women. In India, the struggle for women's autonomy was rarely separated from the struggle against the [[caste system]]{{sfn|Patel|1985|p=7}} and in Israel, though their movement more closely resembled the WLM in the US and Europe, the oppression of Palestinian women was a focal area.{{sfn|Frankfort-Nachmias|Shadmi|2005|p=43}} In Japan, the movement focused on freeing women from societal perceptions of limitations because of their sex, rather than on a stand for equality.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=174}}{{sfn|Ito|2015}} In South Korea, women workers' concerns merged with liberationist ideas within the broader fight against dictatorship,{{sfn|Ching|Louie|2000|pp=123-125}} whereas in Taiwan, theories of respect for women and eliminating double-standards were promoted by weaving in [[Confucianism|Confucianist philosophy]].{{sfn|Chang|2009|p=94}}

== Surveillance ==
The [[FBI]] kept records on numerous participants in the WLM, both spying on them and infiltrating their organizations.{{sfn|Echols|1989|p=8}} Roberta Sapler, a participant in the movement between 1968 and 1973 in Pittsburgh, wrote an article regarding her attempts to obtain the FBI file kept on her during the period.{{sfn|Salper|2008}} Similarly, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] spied upon liberationists in Canada,{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=465}} as did the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] surveil WLM groups and participants in Australia.{{sfn|Smith|2017}} In Germany, the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] ({{lang-de|Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz}}) kept tabs on activists participating in women's center activities. Merely having lived in a communal housing project or been affiliated with rebellious youth movements made liberationists targets for their meeting places to be searched and materials to be confiscated.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1970-77 Fear and Terror}}

== Criticism ==
The philosophy practiced by liberationists assumed a global sisterhood of support working to eliminate inequality without acknowledging that women were not united; other factors, such as age, class, ethnicity, and opportunity (or lack thereof) created spheres wherein women's interests diverged, and some women felt underrepresented by the WLM.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=100}} While many women gained an awareness of how sexism permeated their lives, they did not become radicalized and were uninterested in overthrowing society. They made changes in their lives to address their individual needs and social arrangements, but were unwilling to take action on issues that might threaten their socio-economic status.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=107}} Liberationist theory also failed to recognize a fundamental difference in fighting oppression. Combating sexism had an internal component, whereby one could change the basic power structures within family units and personal spheres to eliminate the inequality. Class struggle and the fight against racism are solely external challenges, requiring public action to eradicate inequality.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=110}}

There was criticism of the movement not only from factions within the movement itself,{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}}{{sfn|Bennett|1970|p=40}} but from outsiders, like [[Hugh Heffner]], ''[[Playboy]]'' founder, who launched a campaign to expose all the "highly irrational, emotional, kookie trends" of feminism in an effort to tear apart feminist ideas that were "unalterably opposed to the romantic boy-girl society" promoted by his magazine.{{sfn|Dow|2014|p=120}} "Women's libbers" were widely characterized as "man-haters" who viewed men as enemies, advocated for [[separatist feminism|all-women societies]], and encouraged women to leave their families behind.{{sfn|Bennett|1970|p=40}} Semanticist Nat Kolodney argued that while women were oppressed by social structures and rarely served in tyrannical roles over the male population as a whole, men in general were not oppressors of women either. Instead, social constructs and the difficulty of removing systems which had long served their purpose exploited both men and women.{{sfn|Kolodney|1978|p=300}} Women's liberationists acknowledged that patriarchy affects both men and women, with the former receiving many privileges from it, but focused on the impact of systemic sexism and misogyny on women throughout the world.

To many women activists in the [[American Indian Movement]], black Civil Rights Movement, [[Chicano Movement#Chicanas in the movement|Chicana Movement]], as well as Asians and other minorities, the activities of the primarily white, middle-class women in the Women's Liberation Movement were focused specifically on sex-based violence and the social construction of gender as a tool of sex-based oppression. By evaluating all economic, socio-cultural, and political issues through the lens of sexism without pairing it with racism and classism, liberationists often poorly represented [[women of color]] in their analyses.{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=337}}{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Longeaux y Vásquez|1997|p=31}} While women of color recognized that sexism was an issue, some did not see how it could be separated from the issue of race or class, which compounds to impact their access to education, health care, housing, jobs, legal justice, and the poverty and violence which permeates their lives.{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Thompson|2002|pp=341–342}}{{sfn|Longeaux y Vásquez|1997|pp=30–31}} For women who did not speak English, or spoke it as a second language, sexism had little to do with the ability to protect herself or utilize existing systems.{{sfn|Castillo|1997|p=46}} The focus on personal freedom was another divergence between white women and women of color. Some did not see the intrinsic connection between the liberation of women and the liberation of men that was advocated for by the Women's Liberation Movement and felt that feminists did not care about the inequalities suffered by men; they felt that the liberation of women without the liberation of men from policies that keep men of color from obtaining jobs and limit their civil rights, further preventing them from being able to protect their families, neither improved humanity as a whole nor improved the plight experienced by families.{{sfn|Sklar|2015}}{{sfn|Longeaux y Vásquez|1997|p=31}} [[Dorothy Height]], president of the [[National Council of Negro Women]], expressed that the best way black women could help themselves was to help their men gain equality.{{sfn|Sklar|2015}}

Regarding the "sex-positive" sect that broke away from the women's liberation movement, extending personal freedom to sexual freedom, the meaning of being free to have relations with whoever one wanted, was lost on black women who had been sexually assaulted and raped with impunity for centuries{{sfn|Sklar|2015}} or Native Women who were routinely sterilized.{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=339}} Their issues were not about limiting their families but having the freedom to form families.{{sfn|Thompson||2002|p=349}} It had very little meaning in the traditional Chicana culture wherein women were required to be virgins until marriage and remain naïve in her marriage.{{sfn|Anonymous|1997|p=83}} Though invited to participate within the Women's Liberation Movement, many women of color cautioned against the single focus on sexism, finding it to be an incomplete analysis without the consideration of racism.{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Thompson||2002|p=342}} Likewise, though many lesbians saw commonalities with Women's Liberation through the goals of eponymous liberation from sex-based oppression, which included fighting against homophobia, others believed that the focus was too narrow to confront the issues they faced.{{sfn|Klemesrud|1970}} Differences in the understanding of gender and how it relates to and informs sex-based oppression and systemic sexism called attention to differences in issues. For example, many liberationists rejected the performance of femininity as a positive behavior, which meant that white lesbians who actively chose to perform femininity had to decide between their desire to be feminine-presenting and their rejection of sexual objectification. Jackie Anderson, an activist and philosopher, observed that in the black lesbian community being able to dress up made them feel confident because during the work week, black women had to conform to dress codes imposed upon them.{{sfn|Enke|2007|p=55}} This was and continues to be a sentiment held by most women, who tend to believe that the feeling of confidence derived from performing femininity as dictated by the sexist status quo is the same as empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Rottenberg, "The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism" (2013) Cultural Studies, 28(3), 418-437. doi: 10.1080/09502386.2013.857361 [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09502386.2013.857361]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The Women's Liberation Movement created a global awareness of patriarchy and sexism.{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=91–92}}{{sfn|Walker|1991|pp=xxii–xxiii}}{{sfn|Sanatan|2016}}{{sfn|''The Winnipeg Free Press''|1989|p=35}} By bringing matters that had long been considered private issues into the public view and linking those issues to deepen understanding about how systemic suppression of women's rights in society are interrelated, liberationists made innovative contributions to feminist theory.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=179-180}} Desiring to know about women's historic contributions but often being thwarted in their search due to centuries of censoring and blocking of women's intellectual work, liberationists brought the study of power relationships, including those of sex and diversity, into the social sciences. They launched women's studies programs and publishing houses to ensure that a more culturally comprehensive history of the complex nature of society was developed.{{sfn|Hannam|2008}}{{sfn|Lee|2014}}

In an effort to distance themselves from the politics and ideas of women in the Liberation Movement, as well as the personal politics which emerged, many [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]] distanced themselves from the early movement. [[Meaghan Morris]], an Australian scholar of popular culture stated that later feminists could not associate themselves with the ideas and politics of the period and maintain their respect.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=5}} And yet, liberationists succeeded in pushing the dominant liberal feminists far to the left of their original aims and forced them to include goals that address sexual discrimination.{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=91–92}} [[Jean Curthoys]] argued that in the rush to distance themselves from liberationists, an unconscious amnesia rewrote the history of their movement,{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=6}} and failed to grasp the achievement that, without a religious connotation, the movement created an "ethic of the irreducible value of human beings."{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=7}} Phrases that were used in the movement, like "consciousness raising" and "male chauvinism," became keywords associated with the movement.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=4}}{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}}
