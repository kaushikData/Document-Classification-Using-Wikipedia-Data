'''Andorra''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Andorra.ogg|æ|n|ˈ|d|ɔːr|ə|,_|-|ˈ|d|ɒr|ə}}; {{IPA-ca|ənˈdorə|lang}}), officially the '''Principality of Andorra''' ({{lang-ca|Principat d'Andorra}}), also called the '''Principality of the Valleys of Andorra'''&lt;ref&gt;Funk and Wagnalls Encyclopedia, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ca|Principat de les Valls d'Andorra|links=no}}), is a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] landlocked [[microstate]] on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in the eastern [[Pyrenees]], bordered by [[France]] in the north and [[Spain]] in the south. Believed to have been created by [[Charlemagne]], Andorra was ruled by the [[Count of Urgell]] until 988 when it was transferred to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|Diocese of Urgell]], and the present principality was formed by [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|a charter in 1278]]. It is known as a [[principality]] as it is a [[diarchy]] headed by two [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Princes]]: the Catholic [[Bishop of Urgell]] in Spain and the [[President of France|President of the Republic of France]].

==Etymology==
The origin of the word ''Andorra'' is unknown, although several hypotheses have been formulated. The oldest derivation of the word ''Andorra'' is from the Greek historian [[Polybius]] (''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'' III, 35, 1) who describes the ''Andosins'', an [[Iberians|Iberian]] [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Pre-Roman tribe]], as historically located in the valleys of Andorra and facing the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the [[Punic Wars]]. The word ''Andosini'' or ''Andosins'' (Ἀνδοσίνοι) may derive from the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''handia'' whose meaning is "big" or "giant".&lt;ref name="Diccionari"&gt;''Diccionari d'Història de Catalunya''; ed. 62; Barcelona; 1998; {{ISBN|84-297-3521-6}}; p. 42; entrada "Andorra"&lt;/ref&gt; The Andorran [[toponymy]] shows evidence of [[Basque language]] in the area. Another theory suggests that the word ''Andorra'' may derive from the old word ''Anorra'' that contains the Basque word ''ur'' (water).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Font Rius |first=José María |title=Estudis sobre els drets i institucions locals en la Catalunya medieval |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQL6rtB8VtQC&amp;pg=PA743&amp;dq=Anorra+andorra#v=onepage&amp;q=Anorra%20andorra |publisher=Edicions Universitat Barcelona |year=1985 |page=743 |isbn=8475281745 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory suggests that ''Andorra'' may derive from [[Arabic]] ''al-durra'', meaning "The forest" (الدرة). When the [[Moors]] colonized the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the valleys of the Pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest, and other regions and towns, also administered by Muslims, received this designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Andorra, the Hidden Republic: Its Origin and Institutions, and the Record of a Journey Thither|year=1912|page=9|last=Gaston|first=L.

Other theories suggest that the term derives from the [[Navarro-Aragonese]] ''andurrial'', which means "land covered with bushes" or "scrubland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Andorra |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[folk etymology]] holds that [[Charlemagne]] had named the region as a reference to the [[Biblical]] [[Cannan|Canaanite]] valley of ''[[Endor (village)|Endor]]'' or ''[[Endor (village)|Andor]]'' (where the [[Midianites]] had been defeated), a name also bestowed by his heir and son [[Louis le Debonnaire]] after defeating the Moors in the "wild valleys of Hell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Images of the Medieval Peasant|page=189|last=Freedman|first=Paul|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=CA, USA|year=1999|isbn=9780804733731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ann%C3%ADbal,_andosins.png|right|thumb|[[Hannibal]]'s route (in red) during the [[Second Punic War]]. The Iberian tribes (in green) fought against the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] army in the Pyrenees.]]

''La Balma de la [[La Margineda|Margineda]]'', found by [[archaeologist]]s at [[Sant Julia de Loria]], was first settled in 9,500 BC as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees. The seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter-gatherers from [[Ariège (river)|Ariege]] and [[Segre (river)|Segre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcami.cat/principat-andorra/andorra/andorra-vella/margineda|title=La Margineda - El Camí|date=21 April 2014|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015125705/http://elcami.cat/principat-andorra/andorra/andorra-vella/margineda|archivedate=15 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Neolithic Age]] a group of people moved to the [[Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley|Valley of Madriu]] (nowadays Natural Parc located in [[Escaldes-Engordany]] declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) as a permanent camp in 6640 BC. The population of the valley grew cereals, raised domestic livestock and developed a commercial trade with people from the [[Sègre (department)|Segre]] and [[Occitania]].{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 32, 33}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}}

Other archaeological deposits include the ''Tombs of [[Segudet]]'' ([[Ordino]]) and ''Feixa del Moro'' (Sant Julia de Loria) both dated in 4900–4300 BC as an example of the [[Urnfield culture|Urn culture]] in Andorra.{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 32, 33}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}}
The model of small settlements begin to evolved as a complex urbanism during the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Metallurgy|Metallurgical]] items of iron, ancient coins and relicaries can be found in the [[Sanctuary|ancient sanctuaries]] scattered around the country.

The [[sanctuary]] of ''Roc de les Bruixes'' (Stone of the Witches) is maybe the most important archeological complex of this age in Andorra, located in the parish of [[Canillo]], about the rituals of funerals, ancient scripture and engraved stone [[mural]]s.{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 34, 35, 38, 39}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}}

===The Iberian and Roman Andorra===
The inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the [[Iberians]] and historically located in Andorra as the Iberian tribe ''Andosins'' or ''Andosini'' (Ἀνδοσίνους) during the 7th and 2nd centuries BC. Influenced by [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanias]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Iberian languages]] the locals developed some current toponyms. Early writings and documents relating this group of people goes back to the second century BC by the Greek writer [[Polybius]] in his ''Histories'' during the [[Punic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www15.gencat.net/pres_casa_llengues/mapes/mapes.html?idioma=1&amp;start=cercador|title=Mapes Vius - Linguamon.

Some of the most significant remains of this era are the Castle of the ''Roc d'Enclar'' (part of the early [[Marca Hispanica]]),{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 44, 45, 46, 47}} ''l'Anxiu'' in [[Les Escaldes]] and ''Roc de L'Oral'' in [[Encamp]].{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}}{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 37, 36}}
The presence of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] influence is recorded from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. The places found with more Roman presence are in ''Camp Vermell'' (Red Field) in Sant Julia de Loria and in some places in Encamp as well as in the ''Roc d'Enclar''. People continued trading, mainly with wine and cereals, with the Roman cities of [[Urgellet]] (nowaday [[La Seu d'Urgell]]) and all across Segre through the ''[[Roman roads|Via Romana]] Strata Ceretana'' (also known as ''Strata Confluetana'').{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 52, 53}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}} {{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 44, 45, 46, 47}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}}

===The Visigoths and Carolingians: the legend of Charlemagne===
[[File:Charlemagne_et_Louis_le_Pieux.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charlemagne]] instructing his son [[Louis the Pious]]]]

After the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] Andorra came under the influence of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]], not remotely from the [[History of Toledo, Spain#Visigothic Toledo|Kingdom of Toledo]], but locally from the [[Diocese of Urgell]]. The Visigoths remained in the valleys for 200 years, during which time [[Gothic Christianity|Christianity]] spread. When the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Empire]] and its [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquest]] of the Iberian Peninsula replaced the ruling Visigoths, Andorra was sheltered from these invaders by the [[Francia|Franks]].{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

Tradition holds that ''Charles the Great'' ([[Charlemagne]]) granted a charter to the Andorran people for a contingent of five thousand soldiers under the command of ''Marc Almugaver'', in return for fighting against the [[Moors]] near [[Porté-Puymorens]] ([[Cerdanya]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turisme.andorralavella.ad/llegendes-tradicionals/pas-carlemany|title=El pas de Carlemany - Turisme Andorra la Vella|website=turisme.andorralavella.ad|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra remained part of the Marca Hispanica of the [[Frankish Empire]] being part of the territory ruled by the [[Count of Urgell]] and eventually by the [[Bishop of Urgel|bishop]] of the Diocese of Urgell. Also tradition holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne, [[Louis the Pious]], writing the ''Carta de Poblament'' or a local [[municipal charter]] circa 805.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/article/19-cultura/933027-andorra-mira-els-arxius.html|title=Andorra mira els arxius|first=Jaume|last=Vidal|website=Elpuntavui.cat|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 988, [[Borrell II]], Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya.&lt;ref name="histo1"&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=La formació d'Andorra|NDCHEC=0003864|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d'Urgell, has been [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-prince]] of Andorra.&lt;ref name=elements&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |title=Elements de la història del Principat d'Andorra |language=Catalan |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100209181327/http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |archivedate= 9 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first document that mentions ''Andorra'' as a territory is the ''Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell'' (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell). The old document dated from 839 depicts the six old [[Parishes of Andorra|parishes]] of the Andorran valleys and therefore the administrative division of the country.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 96 a 146}}

===Medieval Age: The Paréages and the founding of the Co-Principality===
[[File:Esgl%C3%A9sia_de_Sant_Joan_de_Caselles_-_7.jpg|thumb|[[Sant Joan de Caselles]] church, dating from the 11th century, part of the Andorran Romanesque heritage]]
Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys,&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; asked the [[Lord of Caboet]] for help and protection. In 1095 the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya. Years later their daughter, Ermessenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=Ermessenda de Castellbò|NDCHEC=0024413|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; married [[Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix|Roger Bernat II]], the French [[Count of Foix]]. They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and co-sovereigns of Andorra (shared with the Bishop of Urgell).

In the 13th century, a military dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix as aftermath of the [[Cathar Crusade]]. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the king of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Pere el Gran|Pere II]] between the Bishop and the Count,  by the signing of the [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|first paréage]] which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the Bishop of Urgell, in [[Catalonia]]. This gave the [[principality]] its territory and political form.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 96 a 146}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009}}{{sfn|Jordi Planellas|2013}}

A second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the [[Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix|Count of Foix]] ordered the construction of a castle in ''Roc d'Enclar''.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 96 a 146}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009}}{{sfn|Jordi Planellas|2013}} The document was ratified by the noble notary [[County of Cerdanya|Jaume Orig of Puigcerdà]] and the construction of military structures in the country was prohibited.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 60, 61}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 96 a 146}}

In 1364 the political organization of the country named the figure of the [[syndic]] (now spokesman and president of the parliament) as representative of the Andorrans to their co-princes making possible the creation of [[Parishes of Andorra|local departments]] (''comuns'', ''quarts'' and ''veïnats''). After being ratified by the Bishop Francesc Tovia and the Count [[John I, Count of Foix|Jean I]], the ''Consell de la Terra'' or [[General Council (Andorra)|Consell General de les Valls]] (General Council of the Valleys) was founded in 1419, the second oldest parliament in Europe. The syndic Andreu d'Alàs and the General Council organized the creation of the [[Politics of Andorra#Judicial branch|Justice Courts]] (''La Cort de Justicia'') in 1433 with the Co-Princes and the collection of taxes like ''foc i lloc'' (literally ''fire and site'', a national tax active since then).{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 78, 79, 80, 81, 88, 89}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

Although we can find remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century (''Sant Vicenç d'Enclar'' or [[Església de Santa Coloma]]), Andorra developed exquisite [[Romanesque Art and Architecture|Romanesque Art]] during the 9th through 14th centuries, as much in the construction of churches, bridges, religious murals and statues of the [[Virgin and Child]] (being the most important the [[Our Lady of Meritxell]]).{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}} Nowadays, the [[List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches#Romanesque churches in Spain.2C Portugal and Andorra|Romanesque]] buildings that form part of [[Cultural Heritage of Andorra|Andorra's cultural heritage]] stand out in a remarkable way, with an emphasis on [[Església de Sant Esteve]], [[Sant Joan de Caselles]], [[Església de Sant Miquel d'Engolasters]], [[Sant Martí de la Cortinada]] and the medieval bridges of [[Pont de la Margineda|Margineda]] and [[Pont dels Escalls|Escalls]] among many others.{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 48, 49,}}{{sfn|Garcia|2011}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 150 a 194}}

While the Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the [[Catalan language]] at the end of the 11th century Andorra was influenced by the appearance of that language where it was adopted by proximity and influence even decades before it was expanded by the rest of the Kingdom of Aragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webs.racocatala.cat/cat1714/d/histcat.pdf|format=PDF|title=HISTÒRIA DE LA LLENGUA CATALANA|website=Racocatala.cat|accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local population based its economy during the Middle Ages in the livestock and agriculture, as well as in furs and weavers. Later, at the end of the 11th century, the first [[Bloomery#Medieval Europe|foundries of iron]] began to appear in Northern Parishes like [[Ordino]], much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges, an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}{{sfn|Anne Doustaly-Dunyach|2011}}

In 1601 the [[Andorra#Law and criminal justice|Tribunal de Corts]] (High Court of Justice) was created as a result of [[Huguenot rebellions]] from France, [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] courts coming from Spain and [[Catalan mythology about witches|indigenous witchcraft]] experienced in the country due to the [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=44, 45, 47, 48, 50}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 108, 109}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 238, 239}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 238, 239}}  With the passage of time, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After Henry of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France]], he issued an edict in 1607, that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as [[Co-Princes of Andorra]]. During 1617 communal councils form the ''sometent'' (popular militia or army) to deal with the rise of ''bandolerisme'' ([[brigandage]]) and the Consell de la Terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition, organization and competences current today .{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=44, 45, 47, 48, 50}}{{sfn|Jordi Planellas|2013|p = 42}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p = 53, 54, 56}}

Andorra continued with the same economic system that it had during the 12th-14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy (''fargues'', a system similar to ''Farga catalana'') and with the introduction of [[tobacco]] circa 1692 and import trade. The [[fair]] of Andorra la Vella was ratified by the co-princes in 1371 and 1448 being the most important annual national festival commercially ever since.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=14}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=15}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 134}}

The country had a unique and experienced [[guild]] of weavers, ''Confraria de Paraires i Teixidors'', located in [[Escaldes-Engordany]] founded in 1604 taking advantage of the thermal waters of the area. By that time the country was characterized by the social system of ''prohoms'' (wealthy society) and ''casalers'' (rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition), deriving from the tradition of ''[[pubilla]]'' and [[Heir|''hereu'']].{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=20, 21}}{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p=106, 107}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 105, 106, 107, 140, 141}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 263 a 270}}

Three centuries after its foundation the Consell de la Terra located its headquarters and the Tribunal de Corts in [[Casa de la Vall]] in 1702. The [[manor house]] built in 1580 served as a noble fortress of the Busquets family. Inside the parliament was placed the ''Closet of the six keys'' (''Armari de les sis claus'') representative of each Andorran parish and where the [[Andorran constitution]] and other documents and laws were kept later on.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=60}}{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 82}}

In both [[Guerra dels Segadors]] and [[Guerra de Sucesión Española]] conflicts, the Andorran people (although with the statement neutral country) supported the [[Catalans]] who saw their [[Catalan constitutions|rights]] reduced in [[Nueva Planta decrees|1716]]. The reaction was the promotion of Catalan writings in Andorra, with cultural works such as the ''Book of Privileges'' (''Llibre de Privilegis de 1674''), ''Manual Digest'' (1748) by Antoni Fiter i Rossell or the ''Polità andorrà'' (1763) by Antoni Puig.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 229}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 229}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 229}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p = 49 a 52, i 57, 58}}

[[File:Guillem_d%27Areny-Plandolit.png|left|thumb|Portrait of [[Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit]], nobleman and politician who promoted the ''New Reform'' in 1866.]]
After the French Revolution, in 1809, Napoleon I reestablished the Co-Principate and deleted the French medieval tithe. However, in 1812–13, the [[First French Empire]] annexed Catalonia during the [[Peninsular War]] (''Guerra del francés''). They divided it into four [[département]]s, with Andorra being made part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]] (département of [[Sègre]]). In 1814 a royal decree reestablished the independence and economy of Andorra.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 172}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 172}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 342, 343}}

During this period, Andorra's late medieval institutions and rural culture remained largely unchanged. In 1866 the syndic [[Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit]] led the ''reformist'' group in a Council General of 24 members, elected by suffrage limited to heads of families, replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Page 966, Volume 1, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Eleventh Edition 1910–1911&lt;/ref&gt; The New Reform (''Nova Reforma'' or ''Pla de Reforma'') began after being ratified by both Co-Princes and established the basis of the [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] and symbols (such as the [[Flag of Andorra|tricolor flag]]) of Andorra. A new [[service economy]] arose as a demand of the inhabitants of the valleys and began to build infrastructures such as hotels, spa resorts, roads and telegraph lines.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 192, 193}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 191, 192, 193}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 345 a 347}}{{sfn|Segalàs|2012|p = 93 a 95}}

The authorities of the Co-Princes (''veguer'') banned casinos and betting houses throughout the country by establishing an economic conflict with the demand of the Andorran people. The conflict led to the so-called ''Revolution of 1881'' or ''Troubles of Andorra'', when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic during 8 December 1880 and established the ''Provisional Revolutionary Council'' led by Joan Pla i Calvo and Pere Baró i Mas, who granted the construction of casinos and spas to foreign companies.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 198, 199, 203}} During 7 and 9 June 1881, the loyalists of [[Canillo]] and [[Encamp]] reconquered the parishes of [[Ordino]] and [[Massana]] by establishing contact with the revolutionary forces in [[Escaldes-Engordany]].{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998|p = 59, 60, 63}}  After a day of combat finally the [[Pont dels Escalls|Treaty of the Bridge of Escalls]] was signed on 10 June.{{sfn|Ministeri d'Educació, Joventut i Esports|1996|p = 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 194, 195}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 194, 195}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 348 a 350}}{{sfn|Segalàs|2012|p = 95}} The Council was replaced and new elections were held.

Andorra participated in the cultural movement of the Catalan [[Renaixença]]. Between 1882 and 1887 the first academic schools were formed where trilingualism coexists with the knowledge of the official language, Catalan. Some [[Romanticism|romantic]] authors from both France and Spain reported the awakening of the [[Romantic nationalism|national consciousness]] of the country. [[Jacint Verdaguer]] lived in Ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and share works related to the Renaixença with [[Casa Rossell|Joaquim de Riba]], writer and photographer. [[Fromental Halévy]], for his part, had already premiered in 1848 the opera ''[[Le val d'Andorre|Le Val d'Andorre]]'' of great success in Europe, where the national consciousness of the valleys during the [[Peninsular War]] was exposed in the romantic work.{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998|p = 78, 79, 80, 81}}{{sfn|Ministeri d'Educació, Joventut i Esports|1996|p = 74}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 354, 355, 356, 357}}{{sfn|Àrea de Recerca Històrica del Govern d'Andorra|2006|p = 33}}{{sfn|Segalàs|2012}}

===20th century: Modernization of the country and the Constitutional Andorra===
[[File:Borís Skósyrev.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Boris Skossyreff]], briefly self-proclaimed "King of Andorra" in 1934.]]
Andorra declared war on [[Imperial Germany]] during World War I, but did not take part directly in the fighting. It is known that some Andorrans volunteered to take part in the conflict as part of the [[Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion|French Legions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andorradifusio.ad/noticies/andorra-va-declarar-guerra-alemanya-1914|title=Andorra va declarar la guerra a Alemanya el 1914?  - Andorra Difusió|first=Andorra Difusió.|last=RTVA.|website=andorradifusio.ad}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained in an official state of [[belligerency]] until 1958 as it was not included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="DYKAndorra"&gt;{{cite news |title=World War I Ends in Andorra |newspaper=New York Times |date=25 September 1958 |page=66 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/09/25/archives/world-war-i-ends-in-andorra.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, France occupied Andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections due the ''Revolution of 1933'' and the ''FHASA strikes'' (''Vagues de FHASA''); the revolt led by ''Joves Andorrans'' (a [[Trade union|labour union group]] related to the Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) called for political reforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international-club-andorra.com/andorra-club-intercomm/historical-andorra-articles/rebellion-in-andorra-1933/|title=Rebellion in Andorra 1933 – International Club of Andorra|website=www.international-club-andorra.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[universal suffrage|universal suffrage vote]] of all Andorrans and acted in defense of the rights of local and foreign workers during the construction of FHASA's hydroelectric power station in [[Encamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bondia.ad/cultura/1933-la-republica-que-quasi-va-ser|title=1933: la República que quasi va ser|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th April 1933 ''Joves Andorrans'' took the Andorran Parlamient under their custody in rebellion to their requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/spain/la-vanguardia-1%C2%AA-edici%C3%B3n/20170604/282071981866496|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions were preceded by the arrival of Colonel René-Jules Baulard with 50 [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] and the mobilization of 200 local militias or ''sometent'' led by the Síndic Francesc Cairat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bondia.ad/cultura/quan-vam-treure-lescopeta|title=Quan vam treure l'escopeta|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 1934, adventurer [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself "Boris I, King of Andorra", simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell. He was arrested by the Spanish authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from [[Spain]]. From 1936 until 1940, a French military detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to secure the principality against disruption from the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[Francoist Spain]]. Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war. During World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between [[Vichy France]] and [[Spain]].

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation. Since 1976 the country sees the need to reform Andorran institutions due to the anachronisms in the field of sovereignty, human rights and the balance of powers as well as the need to adapt legislation to modern demands. In 1982 a first separation of powers took place when instituting the ''Govern d'Andorra'', under the name of ''Executive Board'' (''Consell Executiu''), chaired by the first prime minister [[Òscar Ribas Reig]] with the approval of the Co-Princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elnacional.cat/ca/efemerides/marc-pons-andorra-primer-cap-govern_227061_102.html|title=Andorra tria el primer cap de govern de la seva història|website=ElNacional.cat}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the Principality signed an agreement with the [[European Economic Community]] to regularize trade relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:21990A1231(02)|title=EUR-Lex - 21990A1231(02) - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its political system was modernized in 1993 after the [[Andorran constitutional referendum, 1993|Andorran constitutional referendum]], when the [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] was drafted by the Co-Princes and the General Council and approved on 14 March&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p160 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 74.2% of voters, with a 76% turnout.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p162&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Andorran parliamentary election, 1993|first elections]] under the new constitution were held later in the year.&lt;ref name=NS/&gt; The same year Andorra became a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Council of Europe]].

Andorra is a parliamentary [[co-principality]] with the [[President of the French Republic|President of France]] and the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Bishop of Urgell]] ([[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]) as [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Princes]]. This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as [[Prince of Andorra]], an elected reigning monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|Head of Government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.

The current Head of Government is [[Antoni Martí]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.

The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors. The Councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.

[[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, Historical and Ceremonial Andorran Parliament.]]
[[File:Casa de la Vall, Andorra la Vieja, Andorra, 2013-12-30, DD 03.JPG|thumb|The [[New Parliament of Andorra]], [[General Council of Andorra|General Council]] headquarter since 2011, next to [[Casa de la Vall]].]]
[[File:Els 7 poetes, Casa de la Vall, Consell General.JPG|thumb|The centre of government in [[Andorra la Vella]].]]

Half are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the Councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election, the Councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the Head of Government is chosen from among the Councillors.

Candidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government. The Syndic General then notifies the Co-Princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Head of Government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.

The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it.

If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-Princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Head of Government is removed.

==Law and criminal justice==
{{Main|Law of Andorra}}
The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Co-Princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.

The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the President of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Co-Princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.

==Foreign relations, defence, and security==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Andorra}}
[[File:Bruxelles rue de la Montagne 10.jpg|thumb|The embassy of Andorra in [[Brussels]] ]]
Andorra does not have its own armed forces,&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; although there is a small ceremonial army. Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with [[France]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1993-16868 |title=Documento BOE-A-1993-16868 |publisher=BOE.es |date=30 June 1993 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in case of emergencies or natural disasters, the ''Sometent'' (an alarm) is called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turisme.andorralavella.ad/?q=en/node/281 |title=El Sometent &amp;#124; Tourism |publisher=Turisme.andorralavella.ad |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="recarrega.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recarrega.net/arxius/Decret%20veguers%20Sometent,%20del%2023%20d%27octubre%20de%201984.pdf |title=Decret veguers Sometent, del 23 d'octubre de 1984 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why all Andorrans, and especially the head of each house (usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house) should, by law, keep a rifle, even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need.&lt;ref name="recarrega.net"/&gt; Andorra is a full member of the United Nations (UN), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), and has a special agreement with the European Union (EU).

===Military===
Andorra has a small army, which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates, but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army. The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the ''Sometent''. Being a [[landlocked country]], Andorra has no [[navy]].

Prior to World War I, Andorra maintained an armed force of about 600 part-time militiamen. This body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials (''viguiers'') appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgell.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite not being involved in any fighting during the [[World War I|First World War]], Andorra was technically the longest combatant, as the country was left out of the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], [[de jure|technically]] remaining at war with Germany from its original declaration of war in 1914 until 24 September 1958 when Andorra officially declared peace with Germany.&lt;ref name="DYKAndorra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reich |first=Herb |date=2012 |title=Lies They Teach in School: Exposing the Myths Behind 250 Commonly Believed Fallacies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsI_ub0Vh7EC |location=New York |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|page=52 |isbn=9781620873458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties. Uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The army's role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the [[Police Corps of Andorra]] in 1931. Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French [[National Gendarmerie]],&lt;!-- Reference removed, as site quoted is currently on WP blacklist --&gt; with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Andorra.html |title=Andorra |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |date= |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1157484 |title=Andorra's 'ARMY' – Eleven Permanent Troops! |work=The Times |date=5 January 1934 |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force consisted of six [[Corporal]]s, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action, and a commander with the rank of major. It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish.

Today a small, twelve-man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Andorran Army, but all able-bodied men remain technically available for military service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=State.gov |date=20 April 2012 |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Can't locate that in the source, but it links to the CIA World factbook, that says:
no regular military forces, Police Service of Andorra (2011)
Military - note:
defense is the responsibility of [[France]] and [[Spain]]--&gt; with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm. The army has not fought for more than 700 years, and its main responsibility is to present the [[flag of Andorra]] at official ceremonial functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aire.ad/documents/10200707_BOP14073Reglament_atm.pdf |title=Bop14073 |format=PDF |date= |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andorramania.com/histoire_gb.htm |title=History of the Principality of Andorra |publisher=Andorramania.com |date=11 December 1997 |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Marc Forné Molné]], Andorra's military budget is strictly from voluntary donations, and the availability of full-time volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/webcast/ga/58/statements/andoeng030925.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=Un.org |date=25 September 2003 |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth that all members of the Andorran Army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=State.gov |date=2013-09-13 |access-date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Andorra-POLITICS-GOVERNMENT-AND-TAXATION.html |title=Andorra Politics, government, and taxation, Information about Politics, government, and taxation in Andorra |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date= |access-date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], or [[non-commissioned officer]]s, because the [[Enlisted rank|other ranks]] are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population, who may still be called upon by the ''Sometent'' to serve, although such a call has not been made in modern times.

===Police Corps===
{{Main|Police Corps of Andorra}}
Andorra maintains a small but modern and well-equipped internal police force, with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants. The principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing, criminal detection, border control, and traffic policing. There are also small specialist units including police dogs, mountain rescue, and a bomb disposal team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carles Iglesias Carril |url=http://www.policia.ad/ |title=Andorran Police Service website |publisher=Policia.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====GIPA====
The ''Grup d'Intervenció Policia d'Andorra'' (GIPA) is a small special forces unit trained in [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage negotiator|hostage recovery]] tasks. Although it is the closest in style to an active military force, it is part of the [[Police Corps of Andorra|Police Corps]], and not the [[Military of Andorra|army]]. As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the country, the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties, and at other times to routine policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carles Iglesias Carril |url=http://www.policia.ad/estructura.html |title=Cos de Policia – Estructura organitzativa |publisher=Policia.ad |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire brigade===
The ''Andorran Fire Brigade'', with headquarters at [[Santa Coloma d'Andorra|Santa Coloma]], operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters. The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), four light support vehicles (cars and vans) and four ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722172143/http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 July 2012 |title=Vehicle details with extensive photo gallery here |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires. The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943. Serious fires which lasted for two days in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service, and the ''Andorran Fire Brigade'' was formed on 21 April 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Fire Brigade history here (in Catalan) |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801135702/http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=44 |archivedate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time: two at the brigade's headquarters in Santa Coloma, and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad |title=Andorran Fire Service site |publisher=Bombers.ad |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parishes===
{{Main|Parishes of Andorra}}
Andorra consists of seven parishes:

* [[Andorra la Vella]]
* [[Canillo]]
* [[Encamp]]
* [[Escaldes-Engordany]]
* [[La Massana]]
* [[Ordino]]
* [[Sant Julià de Lòria]]

===Physical geography===

Due to its location in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the [[Coma Pedrosa]] at {{convert|2942|m|ft|0}}, and the average elevation of Andorra is {{convert|1996|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of Andorra (1991), Andorran Government. {{oclc|801960401}}. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the [[Gran Valira]] river, leaves the country for [[Spain]] (at Andorra's lowest point of {{convert|840|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Andorra's land area is {{convert|468|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0}}.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Andorra belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.

===Climate===
Andorra has an [[alpine climate]] and [[continental climate]]. Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Andorra}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Andorra.jpeg|thumb|Exports in 2009]]

[[File:Caldea des de dins.JPG|thumb|left|[[Caldea]] thermal spa, [[Escaldes-Engordany]], the biggest thermoludic center in Southern Europe.]]
Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10.2&amp;nbsp;million tourists visit annually,&lt;ref name="es2"/&gt; attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts.

One of the main sources of income in Andorra is tourism from ski resorts which total over {{convert|175|km|0|abbr=on}} of ski ground. The sport brings in over 10 million visitors annually and an estimated 340 million euros per year, sustaining 2,000 direct and 10,000 indirect jobs at present since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://offshorelicense-regulatory.com/about-andorra/|title=About Andorra - Valsen Fiduciaries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banking sector, with its [[tax haven]] status, also contributes substantially to the economy (the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 19% of GDP&lt;ref name="fs2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aba.ad/pub/publicaciones/financial_system_2013.pdf|format=PDF|title=Andorra and its financial system 2013|publisher=Aba.ad|accessdate=14 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214121805/http://www.aba.ad/pub/publicaciones/financial_system_2013.pdf|archivedate=14 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The financial system comprises five banking groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebanks.eu/banks-by-country/Andorra |title=List of Banks in Andorra |publisher=Thebanks.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; one specialised credit entity, 8 investment undertaking management entities, 3 asset management companies and 29 insurance companies, 14 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the principality.&lt;ref name="fs2013"/&gt;

Agricultural production is limited, only 2% of the land is arable, and most food has to be imported. Some tobacco is grown locally. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html |title=CIA World Factbook entry: Andorra |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a [[Andorra–European Union relations|special relationship]] with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the [[French franc]] and the [[Spanish peseta]] in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro. Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002. Andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins, beginning in 2014.

Andorra has traditionally had one of the world's lowest unemployment rates. In 2009 it stood at 2.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2129rank.html |title=CIA World Factbook: Andorra |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra has long benefited from its status as a tax haven, with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs. However, during the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] of the 21st century, its tourist economy suffered a decline, partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in [[Spain]], which undercut Andorran [[duty-free shop]]ping. This led to a growth in unemployment. On 1 January 2012, a business tax of 10% was introduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra gets a taste of taxation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/27/andorra-financial-crisis-tax|work=The guardian|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a [[sales tax]] of 2% a year later, which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra Unveils First Indirect Tax Revenue Figures|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Andorra_Unveils_First_Indirect_Tax_Revenue_Figures____60703.html|newspaper=Tax News|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2013, it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an [[income tax]] by the end of June, against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra to introduce income tax for first time|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22745895|newspaper=BBC News|date=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Head of Government [[Antoni Marti]] and the French President and Prince of Andorra, [[François Hollande]]. Hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra "bringing its taxation in line with international standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.notretemps.com/argent/andorre-aligne-progressivement-sa,i29431|title=Andorre aligne progressivement sa fiscalité sur les standards internationaux (Elysée)|newspaper=Notre Temps|date=31 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616031601/http://www.notretemps.com/argent/andorre-aligne-progressivement-sa,i29431|archivedate=16 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Andorra}}
The historic and [[official language]] is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a [[Romance language]]. The Andorran government encourages the use of Catalan. It funds a Commission for Catalan [[Toponymy]] in Andorra (Catalan: ''la Comissió de Toponímia d'Andorra''), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants. Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan.

Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[French language|French]] are also commonly spoken. Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan. English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts. Andorra is one of only four European countries (together with France, Monaco, and Turkey)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/default_en.asp |title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM) : National Minorities, '&amp;#39;Council of Europe'&amp;#39;, 14 September 2010 |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that have never signed the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=157&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities CETS No. 157 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The population of Andorra is predominantly (88.2%) Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/table-christian-population-as-percentages-of-total-population-by-country/ PEW 2011]. Pewforum.org (2011-12-19). Retrieved on 2015-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Their patron saint is [[Our Lady of Meritxell]]. Though it is not an official state religion, the constitution acknowledges a special relationship with the Catholic Church, offering some special privileges to that group{{clarify|date=August 2014}}. Other Christian denominations include the [[Anglican Church]], the [[Unification Church]], the [[New Apostolic Church]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. The small [[Islam in Andorra|Muslim community]] is primarily made up of North African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra facts|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/places/spain-portugal-italy-greece-and-balkans/spanish-and-portuguese-political-geography/andorra|website=Encyclopedia.com|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small community of [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Bahá'í Faith in Andorra|Bahá'ís]],&lt;ref name="ARDA05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Andorra | work = International – Regions – Southern Europe | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_6_2.asp | accessdate = 4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfram"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Andorra: population, capital, cities, GDP, map, flag, currency, languages, ... | encyclopedia = [[Wolfram Alpha]] | volume = Online | publisher = Wolfram – Alpha (curated data) | date = 13 March 2010 | url =http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/countries/andorra/xy/p0/k6/| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120308145150/http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/countries/andorra/xy/p0/k6/| archivedate =2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and roughly 100 Jews live in Andorra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51537.htm |title=US Dept of State information |publisher=State.gov |date=8 November 2005 |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[History of the Jews in Andorra]].)

==Education==

===Schools===
Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required by law to have full-time education. Education up to secondary level is provided free of charge by the government.

There are three systems of school, Andorran, French and Spanish, which use Catalan, French and Spanish languages respectively, as the main language of instruction. Parents may choose which system their children attend. All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by [[France]] and [[Spain]]. 39% of Andorran children attend Andorran schools, 33% attend French schools, and 28% Spanish schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://andorraguides.com/school/system/|title=Andorra's School System {{!}} Andorra Guides|date=2018-05-03|work=Andorra Guides|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Andorra===
The [[Universitat d'Andorra]] (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra. It was established in 1997. The university provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses. The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.

====Virtual Studies Centre====
The geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic programme, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities. The Virtual Studies Centre (''Centre d'Estudis Virtuals'') at the University runs approximately twenty different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan philology, humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies. The Centre also runs various postgraduate programmes and continuing-education courses for professionals.

[[File:AGC Z 27500.jpg|thumb|A train at [[Latour-de-Carol]] (''La Tor de Querol''), one of the two stations serving Andorra. Andorra has no railways, although the line connecting Latour-de-Carol and [[Toulouse]], which in turn connects to France's [[TGV]]s at Toulouse, runs within {{convert|2|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} of the Andorran border.]]

Until the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation. Even now, the nearest major airports at Toulouse and Barcelona are both three hours' drive from Andorra.

Andorra has a road network of {{convert|279|km|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|76|km|0|abbr=on}} is unpaved. The two main roads out of [[Andorra la Vella]] are the CG-1 to the Spanish border, and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near [[El Pas de la Casa]].&lt;ref name="mobi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilitat.ad/CA/default.asp|archive-url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20130317185954/http://www.mobilitat.ad/CA/default.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-03-17|title=Agència de Mobilitat, Govern d'Andorra |publisher=Mobilitat.ad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times. There are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to [[Barcelona]] and [[Toulouse]], plus a daily tour from the former city. Bus services are mostly run by private companies, but some local ones are operated by the government.

There are no airports for fixed-wing aircraft within Andorra's borders but there are, however, heliports in [[La Massana]] (Camí Heliport), [[Arinsal]] and [[Escaldes-Engordany]] with commercial helicopter services&lt;ref name="heliand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heliand.com/ |title=Inici – Heliand – Helicopters a Andorra |publisher=Heliand |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="helitrans"&gt;[http://www.helitrans.ad/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715233032/http://www.helitrans.ad/|date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an airport located in the neighbouring Spanish comarca of [[Alt Urgell]], {{convert|12|km|abbr=off}} south of the Andorran-Spanish border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.gencat.cat/en/actualitat/detall/Aeroport-public-i-comercial-dAndorra-la-Seu-dUrgell-00002|title=Public and regional airport of Andorra-la Seu d'Urgell|access-date=18 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328143700/http://web.gencat.cat/en/actualitat/detall/Aeroport-public-i-comercial-dAndorra-la-Seu-dUrgell-00002|archive-date=28 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 2015, [[Andorra–La Seu d'Urgell Airport]] has operated commercial flights to [[Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport|Madrid]] and [[Palma de Mallorca Airport|Palma de Mallorca]], and is the [[airline hub|main hub]] for [[Air Andorra]] and [[Andorra Airlines]]. As of 11 July 2018, there are no regular commercial flights at the airport.

Nearby airports located in [[Spain]] and [[France]] provide access to international flights for the principality. The nearest airports are at [[Perpignan–Rivesaltes Airport|Perpignan]], France ({{convert|156|km|disp=or|abbr=off}} from Andorra) and [[Lleida-Alguaire Airport|Lleida]], [[Spain]] ({{convert|160|km|disp=or|abbr=off}} from Andorra). The largest nearby airports are at [[Toulouse–Blagnac Airport|Toulouse]], France ({{convert|165|disp=or|km|abbr=off}} from Andorra) and [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona]], [[Spain]] ({{convert|215|km|disp=or|abbr=off}} from Andorra). There are hourly bus services from both Barcelona and Toulouse airports to Andorra.

The nearest railway station is [[L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre]] {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Andorra which is on the {{RailGauge|1435mm}}[[Standard gauge|-gauge]] line from [[Latour-de-Carol]] ({{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) southeast of Andorra, to [[Toulouse]] and on to Paris by the French [[TGV|high-speed trains]].

==Media and telecommunications==
{{Main|Telecommunications in Andorra}}
{{See also|Andorra Telecom}}
{{update|section|date=November 2015}}
In Andorra, mobile and fixed telephone and internet services are operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, SOM, also known as [[Andorra Telecom]] (STA). The same company also manages the technical infrastructure for national broadcasting of digital television and radio.

By the end of 2010, it was planned that every home in the country would have fibre-to-the-home for internet access at a minimum speed of 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s,&lt;ref name="somfo"&gt;SOM Newsletter, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the availability was complete in June 2012.

There is only one Andorran television station, ''[[Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra]]'' (RTVA). ''Radio Nacional d'Andorra'' operates two radio stations, ''[[Radio Andorra]]'' and ''Andorra Música''. There are three national newspapers, ''[[Diari d'Andorra]]'', ''[[El Periòdic d'Andorra]]'', and ''[[Bondia (newspaper)|Bondia]]'' as well as several local newspapers.  There is also an [[amateur radio]] society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ura.ad/ Unió de Radioaficionats Andorra]. Ura.ad. Retrieved on 2015-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional TV and radio stations from [[Spain]] and [[France]] are available via digital terrestrial television and IPTV.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Andorra}}
{{See also|Music of Andorra}}
[[File:HPIM0309.JPG|thumb|right|Andorran flag on balcony, Ordino]]
The official and historic language is Catalan. Thus the culture is Catalan, with its own specificity.

Andorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs and marratxa, which survive in [[Sant Julià de Lòria]] especially. Andorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbours, but is especially [[music of Catalonia|Catalan]] in character, especially in the presence of dances such as the [[sardana]]. Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in [[Andorra la Vella]] and Saint Anne's dance in Escaldes-Engordany. Andorra's national holiday is [[Our Lady of Meritxell]] Day, 8 September.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; American folk artist [[Malvina Reynolds]], intrigued by its defence budget of $4.90, wrote a song "Andorra". [[Pete Seeger]] added verses, and sang "Andorra" on his 1962 album ''The Bitter and the Sweet''.

==Sports==
Andorra is famous for the practice of [[winter sports]]. Popular sports played in Andorra include [[Association football|football]], [[rugby union]], [[basketball]] and [[Roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]].

In [[Roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] Andorra usually plays in [[CERH European Roller Hockey Championship|CERH Euro Cup]] and in [[FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup]]. In 2011, Andorra was the host country to the [[2011 European League Final Eight]].

[[File:Estadi Comunal Vella.jpg|thumb|[[Estadi Comunal d'Andorra la Vella]] ]]
The country is represented in association football by the [[Andorra national football team]]. However, the team has had little success internationally because of Andorra's small population.&lt;ref name="fifa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=and/ranking/gender=m/index.html |title=FIFA Rankings – Andorra |publisher=Fifa.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Football is governed in Andorra by the [[Andorran Football Federation]] - founded in 1994, it organizes the national competitions of association football ([[Primera Divisió]], [[Copa Constitució]] and [[Andorran Supercup|Supercopa]]) and [[futsal]]. Andorra was admitted to [[UEFA]] and [[FIFA]] in the same year, 1996. [[FC Andorra]], a club based in [[Andorra la Vella]] founded in 1942, compete in the [[Spanish football league system]].

[[Rugby union|Rugby]] is a traditional sport in Andorra, mainly influenced by the popularity in southern France. The [[Andorra national rugby union team]], nicknamed "''Els Isards''", has impressed on the international stage in [[rugby union]] and [[rugby sevens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irb.com/rankings/sportid=1/news/newsid=2070876.html#usa+andorra+improve+rating+rankings]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522033240/http://www.irb.com/rankings/sportid%3D1/news/newsid%3D2070876.html|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[VPC Andorra XV]] is a rugby team based in [[Andorra la Vella]] actually playing in the French championship.

Basketball popularity has increased in the country since the 1990s, when the Andorran team [[BC Andorra]] played in the top league of [[Spain]] ([[Liga ACB]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2012/11/13/baloncesto/basketfeb/1352828175.html |title=El BC Andorra quiere volver a la Liga más bella |publisher=MARCA.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 18 years the club returned to the top league in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/deportes/2014/03/22/532e12b2e2704e1a3d8b457f.html |title=El River Andorra regresa a la ACB 18 años después &amp;#124; Baloncesto &amp;#124; EL MUNDO |publisher=Elmundo.es |date=2014-03-22 |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sports practised in Andorra include [[cycling]], volleyball, [[judo]], [[Australian Rules football]], [[handball]], swimming, gymnastics, tennis and [[motorsports]]. In 2012, Andorra raised its first national [[cricket]] team and played a home match against the Dutch Fellowship of Fairly Odd Places Cricket Club, the first match played in the history of Andorra at an altitude of {{convert|1300|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netherlands Based FFOP CC Beats Andorra National Team|url=http://www.cricketworld.com/netherlands-based-ffop-cc-beats-andorra-xi/32216.htm|work=Cricket World|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra first participated at the [[Olympic Games]] in 1976. The country has also appeared in every [[Winter Olympic]] Games since [[1976 Winter Olympics|1976]]. Andorra competes in the [[Games of the Small States of Europe]] being twice the host country in [[1991 Games of the Small States of Europe|1991]] and [[2005 Games of the Small States of Europe|2005]].

As part of the Catalan cultural ambit, Andorra is home to a team of [[castell]]ers, or Catalan human tower builders. The {{ill|Castellers d'Andorra|ca}}, based in the town of [[Santa Coloma d'Andorra]], are recognized by the [[:ca:Coordinadora de Colles Castelleres de Catalunya|Coordinadora de Colles Castelleres de Catalunya]], the governing body of castells.

'''Banking in Iceland''' faced a crisis in 2008, which resulted in the government taking over three of its largest [[commercial bank]]s.

The short-term liabilities of Icelandic banks in proportion to Iceland's [[GDP]] are 211%, as of 11 October 2008, or 480% of the country's national debt, and the average leverage ratio (assets/net worth) is 1 to 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/business/worldbusiness/11charts.html|title=The World’s Banks Could Prove Too Big to Fail — or to Rescue|date=11 October 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benevolent neutrality''' is a term used by [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] to describe [[United States foreign policy]] regarding involvement in [[World War I]]. Examples were seen shortly before the war, with the [[League of the Three Emperors]], an agreement between the powers of [[Russia]], [[Germany]], and [[Austria-Hungary]]. It is distinct from strict neutrality because America had some favorable policies towards the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]; for example, generally favorable trade decisions, accentuated by the better availability of information about the Allies, and the pre-existing state of public opinion. Eventually, benevolent neutrality favoured the Allies even more, allowing them loans and arms.

It also played a role in [[World War II]], in that US trade policies and diplomatic aid favoured the future [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] powers of [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]].

The party is led by [[Nicéphore Soglo]], who was [[President of Benin]] from 1991 to 1996 and later Mayor of [[Cotonou]].

Soglo was the RB candidate in the [[Beninese presidential election, 2001|March 2001 presidential election]], taking second place with 27.1% of the popular vote in the first round, but he boycotted the second round. In the [[Beninese parliamentary election, 2003|parliamentary election]] held on 30 March 2003, the party won 15 out of 83 seats.

In early August 2005, the RB chose Soglo's son [[Lehady Soglo]] as its candidate for the [[Beninese presidential election, 2006|March 2006 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;"Benin: Ex-leader's son to run for presidency in 2006", Radio France Internationale, August 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The elder Soglo could not run because of the constitutional age limit of 70 years for candidates. In the election, Lehady Soglo obtained 7.92% of the vote and placed fourth. 

In the [[Beninese parliamentary election, 2007|March 2007 parliamentary election]], the RB participated in the [[Alliance for a Dynamic Democracy]],&lt;ref&gt;Alain C.

[[File:Bjerkebanen.jpeg|thumb|Bjerkebanen in Oslo in 1955. The stables are in the foreground, and ''Økernveien'' ([[Økern]] Street) lies to the right.]]
'''Bjerkebanen''', often simply called '''Bjerke''', is a neighborhood in the [[Økern]] district of the [[Bjerke]] borough in northeastern [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heiberg|first1=Hans|title=Det er vår egen by: Oslo ved 900 års jubileet|date=1950|publisher=Oslo kommune|location=Oslo|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies in the [[Grorud Valley]]. The area is dominated by the [[Bjerke Travbane|Bjerke Race Track]], a harness racing track (established in 1928),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bjerke Travbane|url=https://snl.no/Bjerke_Travbane|website=Store norske leksikon|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its stadium building, stable building, and a large parking lot.

The area is bordered by the Refstad neighborhood to the west and Brobekk to the east, and by Risløkka and Vollebekk to the south. The north side is bounded by [[Norwegian National Road 4]] and ''Trondheimsveien'' (Trondheim Street), separating the area from the [[Årvoll]] neighborhood.

Bjerkebanen mostly consists of residential buildings detached houses, townhouses, and small apartment buildings. ''Refstadveien'' (Refstad Street) and ''Økernveien'' (Økern Street) are the two largest streets in the area.

The second leg was in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]], and lost again by 3-0, resulting in a 6-0 aggregate and lost qualification for the Championship.

The '''Galician Unions Confederacy''' ({{lang-gl|italic=yes|Confederación Intersindical Galega, CIG}}) is a trade union in  that was created after the merge of two previous unions: the [[Intersindical Nacional dos Traballadores Galegos|INTG]] and the [[Confederación Xeral de Traballadores Galegos-Intersindical Nacional|CXTG]]. It has a [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] and [[socialist]] ideology and generally defends a combative labour model, as opposed to the perceived mild tactics of the other two main unions in Galicia, [[CCOO]] and the [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]]. The union has organized 6 general strikes in Galicia since its creation.&lt;ref&gt;http://folgaxeral.info/?page_id=19&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the CIG has 4,480 labour delegates (28.28% of the total)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sermosgaliza.gal/articulo/traballo/cig-xa-primeira-forza-sindical-galiza/20180628115711070152.html A CIG xa é a primeira forza sindical en Galiza].

There are several sectors in [[Ethiopia]] where businesses are particularly vulnerable to [[corruption]]. Land distribution and [[Administration (law)|administration]] is a sector where corruption is institutionalized, and facilitation payments as well as [[bribes]] are often demanded from businesses when they deal with land-related issues. Corruption also occurs when businesses obtain [[license|permits]] and [[licenses]] due to complicated [[bureaucracy]]. Public procurement is also seriously hampered by corruption, and different types of irregularities exist, such as non-transparent tender processes and awarding contracts to people with close connection to the [[Government of Ethiopia|government]] and ruling party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/ethiopia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Dinle"''' ("Listen") was the [[Turkey|Turkish]] entrant to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997]] in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]. It was composed by [[Levent Çoker]] and Mehtap Alnıtemiz, and was performed by [[Şebnem Paker]] in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. This was the second time that Paker had competed at Eurovision, having represented Turkey also at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996 contest]] with "[[Beşinci Mevsim]]".

On the night it was performed second, following [[Cyprus]]'s [[Hara &amp; Andreas Konstantinou]] singing "[[Mana Mu|Mana Mou]]" and preceding [[Norway]]'s [[Tor Endresen]] with "[[San Francisco (Tor Endresen song)|San Francisco]]". At the close of the voting it had received 121 points, placing third in a field of 25. This was Turkey's best position in the contest until their win in 2003, and is still the best position of a Turkish language entry at Eurovision as of 2017.

It was succeeded as Turkish representative at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998 contest]] with Tüzmen and "[[Unutamazsın]]".

'''Freesat from Sky''' is a British satellite television service from [[Sky UK]]. It offers over 240 [[free-to-air]] (FTA) channels in its [[EPG]].&lt;ref name="free"&gt;[http://www.lyngsat.com/freetv/United-Kingdom.html List of Free To Air channels broadcast from the UK]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a greater number than its competitors, [[Freesat]], which has 200+, and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], which has 70+.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sky.com/shop/freesat/home/why-choose-freesat/ Why choose Freesat from Sky]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 11 March 2012
| format = Website
| publisher= Join Freesat
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It also has up to six HD channels and [[Sky Active]] interactive data service. The service is less-promoted than the for-pay Sky digital satellite service.

==Service reach==
{{As of|2011|April}}, the number of households with free-to-view satellite television is estimated by [[Ofcom]] to be 2.045 million, or 8.0% of households with television.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

| pages= 3
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (This figure includes households with BBC/ITV Freesat, ''Freesat from Sky'', and '[[churn rate|churned]]' Sky subscribers who kept their Sky Digiboxes to access free-to-view channels.)

==Reception equipment==
This service requires use of the proprietary [[Digibox|SkyHD or SD]] [[set-top box]], to receive the FTA channels. Sky's boxes use the proprietary OpenTV EPG for interactive television services. The boxes are limited in some regards when compared to other satellite receivers, such as digital audio, video outputs, and the lack of the ability to use a dish motor and scan for channels not carried on the EPG. They also feature an EPG that contains all Sky channels, including pay-TV services which are not available to non-subscription viewers.
Sky currently include a SkyHD Digibox with new ''FsfS'' installations. These boxes receive a selection of standard definition and HD channels, but do not record.  Those who wish to have Sky+ functionality (recording &amp; time-shifting) must buy their own box, requiring Sky to 'pair' their existing viewing card to the new box. In addition, use of the recording facilities of these PVRs also requires an ongoing monthly fee.

===Viewing card===
''Freesat from Sky'' differentiates itself from [[Freesat]] not just by its use of Sky equipment but by offering both [[free-to-air]] and [[free-to-view]] channels. A card is included with installation or can be purchased direct from Sky. For security reasons&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

| publisher= [[BSkyB]]
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; the viewing cards are deactivated from time to time and reception of the encrypted free-to-view channels disabled. This requires the user to purchase a new viewing card at the current standard charge. Sky viewing cards used to access subscription services revert to acting as ''FsfS'' viewing cards upon cancellation of the subscription. The viewing card also ensures the correct region for regionalised services for [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and [[Channel 4]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==== Extra channels ====
The following is a list of free-to-view channels on the ''FsfS'' platform.&lt;ref name=freesky-list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdsdigital.co.uk/channel-list.html |title=Freesky Channel List |publisher=Satellite &amp; Digital Services Ltd |accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A viewing card is required to watch them. None of these channels are available on [[Freesat]]. BT broadband subscribers can also receive BT Sport using a ''FsfS'' viewing card.

* [[Local television in the United Kingdom|Local TV channels]]{{refn|group=nb|Not all local TV channels are available on the Sky platform and only the relevant channel for the user's postcode is shown in the EPG.}}
* Insight HD
* [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday +1]]

{{Reflist|group=nb}}

==== Other features ====
* The viewing card can be used to receive the correct region on the main channel number for the following services:
** [[BBC One]]
** [[BBC Two]]
** [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] / [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] / [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]]
** [[Channel 4]]

==Competition==
''Freesat from Sky'' is a competitor to the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s [[Freesat]] service which also broadcasts from [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2°E]] and [[Eutelsat 28A|28.5°E]] and the DTT service [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]. ''FsfS'' has five free-to-view channels which are not available on Freesat (see above) and a large number of free-to-air channels which are not directly listed in the Freesat EPG and need manual tuning to receive them.

''FsfS'' has over 240 free-to-air channels on its [[Electronic program guide|EPG]], (which do not require either a viewing card nor a Sky receiver to watch), including [[Bloomberg Television]] and the [[Travel Channel (UK)|Travel Channel]], compared to 198 free-to-air channels on [[Freesat]] [[Electronic program guide|EPG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sky.com/shop/freesat/home/what-can-i-watch/| title = What can I watch?| accessdate = 1 September 2014| publisher= [[BSkyB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the remaining free-to-air channels not available through the main EPG, and needing manual tuning by the user.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Freeview [[digital terrestrial television]] has over 50 free-to-air channels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.freeview.co.uk/Channels| title = Channels| accessdate = 11 December 2011| publisher= [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cannot be manually tuned into the free-to-air channels available.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} ''FsfS'' also pre-tunes the boxes to the correct regional services of broadcasters who offer regional services such as the [[BBC]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sky.com/shop/freesat/home/why-choose-freesat/
| title = Why choose Freesat from Sky?| accessdate = 11 December 2011| date= 11 December 2011| work = The Communications Market: Digital Progress Report – Digital TV, Q1 2011| publisher= [[BSkyB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which on Freesat requires the user manually to enter their postcode during set-up for these correct regional services.

Conversely, there are some TV channels that are on Freeview but are not on the Sky EPG, including many adult-category services. Most programming is simulcast on adult-category channels on Sky, but with different channel names and broadcast times.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2141">The '''Group of Nine''' ('''G9''') is a group of nine northeastern European nations that would meet occasionally to discuss matters of mutual interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/147.abstract Small States and Inter-European Relations: An Analysis of the Group of Nine"]&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012}}, there is no evidence that the group is either active or not, nor if any country from the Former Yugoslavia is still active.

==History==
The alliance first came out in 1965, when the nine nations were [[lobbying]] and presenting a case study. They co-sponsor the Resolution 2129 promoting East-West cooperation in Europe, adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/20/ares20.htm RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY DURING ITS TWENTIETH SESSION]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia]] of 1968, the group met again to discuss any issues that may arise because of the attack. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

'''Judaeo-Aragonese''' (Aragonese: ''Chodigo-Aragonés'') was a [[Judaeo-Romance languages|Judaeo-Romance language]], a [[Jewish languages|Jewish language]] that was derived from [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]. It was used by [[Spanish Jews]] in north-central [[Spain]] from the mid-8th century to the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]], which expelled Jews from Spain. Later, it either merged with the various Judaeo-Spanish dialects or fell out of use because the far more influential [[Judaeo-Spanish]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

While there are some scholars that believe that the language may have had some speakers until the [[Second World War]],{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} most scholars believe that it died out in the [[Middle Ages]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Along with [[Judaeo-Catalan]], Judaeo-Aragonese shares a marked component of [[Judaeo-Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wexler|first1=Paul|title=Three heirs to a Judeo-Latin legacy: Judeo-Ibero-Romance, Yiddish, and Rotwelsch|date=1988|publisher=O.

The '''Belgian Law''' ({{lang-nl|Belgisch recht}}; {{lang-fr|Droit belge}}) is very similar to that of neighbouring [[France]], as a result of [[Belgium]] having adopted the [[Napoleonic code]] which governs French society. It also derives from the [[Constitution of Belgium]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

Due to a series of [[state reform in Belgium|state reforms in Belgium]], the country has been transformed from a unitary to a [[Federalism|federal]] state. Consequently, in addition to the federal level, the [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|communities and regions]] have legislative authority in certain matters. Federal legislation is called a "law" whereas regional legislation is called a "[[Decree (Belgium)|decree]]" (''decreet, décret''), except for that of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] which is called an "[[Ordinance (Belgium)|ordinance]]" (''ordonnantie, ordonnance'').

'''Mirrorthrone''' is a [[one-man band|one-man]] [[symphonic black metal]] band formed by Vladimir Cochet in 2000.

==Biography==
Mirrorthrone came into being in 2000 when it was created by Vladimir Cochet, the only member of the one man project. In late 2001 and 2002, two demo CD's were recorded, which drew the attention of Red Stream Inc. After signing to Red Stream Inc. The first Mirrothrone album was ''[[Of Wind and Weeping]]''. The follow-up album, ''[[Carriers of Dust]]'' followed in 2006, and received even more positive reviews. Following the positive feedback for his second album, Vladimir soon announced that he was preparing another album, ''[[Gangrene (album)|Gangrene]]'', which ended up being released on April 14, 2008

==Controversy==
The lyrics to "A Scream to Express the Hate of a Race" were frequently misinterpreted as being racist. As a result, Cochet issued the following statement on Mirrorthrone's website:

:This is an answer to the polemic which is current at the moment on the Internet. '''No, Mirrorthrone is NOT racist, nazi, white pride or whatever you call it.''' The lyrics of the song "A Scream to Express the Hate of a Race" target the human race in its entirety. It attacks what is called the "nihilism" of a certain form of society that has been spreading around the globe and that envelops the "moral, social, religious and scientific" paradigms. I am not going to develop more for my aim is not to offer text analysis of what I have written; I only want to clarify the situation. Please read and understand at least a minimum before commenting.

{{Politics of Moldova}}

A '''referendum on remaining an independent nation''' was held in [[Moldova]] on 6 March 1994.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1330 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiated by President [[Mircea Snegur]], it was referred to as a "Consultation with the people" ({{lang-ro|La sfat cu poporul}}), and was approved by 97.9% of voters.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1339&lt;/ref&gt;

==Question==
{{blockquote|Do you want the [[Republic of Moldova]] to develop as an independent and unitary state, in the frontiers recognized in the day where Moldova declared sovereignty, to promote a policy of neutrality and to maintain mutually-benefiting economic relations with all the countries of the world, and to guarantee its citizens equal rights, according to international law?}}

==Legality issues==
The referendum was organized by a specially created republican commission after the Central Elections Commission refused to become involved.&lt;ref name=N1/&gt; However, its organization was in contravention of the 1992 referendums law, which stated that a referendum commission should have been formed by Parliament 60 days before the referendum, and no referendums should be held 90 days either side of elections (the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 1994|parliamentary elections]] had been held a week earlier).&lt;ref name=N1/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Many public figures and much of the press presented the referendum as a strong blow to the [[movement for unification of Romania and Moldova]] in both countries, despite the fact that the question did not refer directly to [[Romania]], but to independence. It also referred to territorial integrity, which was a main preoccupation due to the [[Transnistrian conflict]].

'''Monastery of St. Mark of Koriša''' ({{lang-sr|Манастир Свети Марко Коришки}}, {{lang-al|Manastiri i Markut të Shenjtë, Korishë}}) was a [[Serbian Orthodox]] monastery, built in 1467, located in [[Koriša]], [[Prizren]], [[Kosovo]]{{ref label|status|a|}}. The entire complex was declared a [[Protected Monuments of Culture (Serbia)|Protected Monument of Culture]] in 1959, and it is ''de jure'' protected by [[Republic of Serbia]].&lt;ref name="SANU" &gt;{{CHS-SANU|Link=318|Name=Манастир са црквно Св. Марка}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a single-nave church, built on a rectangular foundation. It was severely damaged after the end of the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="SANU"/&gt;

== History ==
The ruins of the monastery of St. Mark of Koriša stands on a rocky outpost above the [[Koriša river]] near the village of [[Koriša]], near Prizren.&lt;ref name=KIM-info&gt;{{cite news|title=Pomozite manastiru Svetog Marka Koriskog|publisher=KIM-info|date=August 7, 2005|url=http://www.kosovo.net/news/archive/2005/August_07/2.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501042124/http://kosovo.net/news/archive/2005/August_07/2.html|archivedate=May 1, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to preserved documents, the monastery was built by Jovan and Branko Vlahić in 1467, and it was a ''[[metochion]]'' (granted church land) to the [[Hermitage of St. Peter of Koriša]], built in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=KIM-info/&gt; The monastery is mentioned in the Ottoman [[defter]] of 1520.&lt;ref name=KIM-info/&gt; It was abandoned in the 16th century, and reactivated in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=KIM-info/&gt; In 1765, monk Neofit brought "many books from [[Visoki Dečani|Dečani]]".&lt;ref name=KIM-info/&gt;

In 1779, Partenije Popović was a monk at the monastery, whither he brought several important medieval books and manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Slovo, [http://slovosrpsko.net/stari-brojevi/slovo18.pdf No. 18], p. 45 {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, a schoolteacher in Prizren, [[Nikola Musulin]], found [[Dušan's Code]], the constitution of the [[Serbian Empire]]. The following year the charter of the Monastery of the Holy Archangels also issued by [[Stefan Dušan]] was found in St. Nicholas Church of Koriša.&lt;ref name=Radovanovic268&gt;{{harvnb|Radovanović|2008|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the western side, above the rock, a [[Bell tower|belfry]] with two bells was added in 1861 as a foundation of [[Sima Andrejević]].

After that, monastery was almost abandoned up until 1995, when monastery life restarted.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In 1999, the monastery was vandalized and set on fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Veselin Kesich|title=Kosovo in the History of the Serbian Church|chapter=VI|url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/kosovo/delo/11556}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the preserved fragment of the original [[fresco]] was destroyed. The monastery had a valuable library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12366">The '''New International Economic Order''' ('''NIEO''') was a set of proposals put forward during the 1970's by some developing countries through the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] to promote their interests by improving their [[terms of trade]], increasing development assistance, developed-country tariff reductions, and other means. It was meant to be a revision of the international economic system in favour of [[Third World]] countries, replacing the [[Bretton Woods system]], which had benefited the leading states that had created it &amp;ndash; especially the [[United States]]. This order was demanded by the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].


==History==
The term was derived from the ''Declaration for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order'', adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1974, and referred to a wide range of trade, financial, commodity, and debt-related issues (1 May 1974, A/RES/S-6/3201).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/s6r3201.htm Declaration for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order]: United Nations General Assembly document A/RES/S-6/3201 of 1 May 1974&lt;/ref&gt; This followed an agenda for discussions between industrial and developing countries, focusing on restructuring of the world's economy to permit greater participation by and benefits to [[developing country|developing countries]] (also known as the "North-South Dialogue"). Along with the declaration, a '''Programme of Action''' and a '''Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States''' (12 December 1974, A/RES/29/3281).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/a29r3281.htm Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States]: United Nations General Assembly document A/RES/29/3281 of 12 December 1974&lt;/ref&gt; were also adopted.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the developing countries pushed for NIEO and an accompanying set of documents to be adopted by the UN General Assembly. Subsequently, however, these norms became only of [[rhetoric]]al and political value, except for some partly viable mechanisms, such as the non-legal, [[non-binding]] '''Restrictive Business Practice Code''' adopted in 1980 and the [[Common Fund for Commodities]] which came in force in 1989.

==Tenets==
The main tenets of NIEO were:
# Developing countries must be entitled to regulate and control the activities of [[multinational corporation]]s operating within their territory.
# They must be free to [[nationalize]] or [[expropriate]] foreign property on conditions favourable to them.
# They must be free to set up [[Voluntary association|associations]] of [[primary commodities]] producers similar to the [[OPEC]]; all other [[Sovereign state|States]] must recognize this right and refrain from taking economic, military, or political measures calculated to restrict it.
# [[International trade]] should be based on the need to ensure stable, [[Equity (economics)|equitable]], and [[remunerative]] prices for raw materials, generalized [[Reciprocity (international relations)|non-reciprocal]] and [[non-discriminatory]] [[tariff]] preferences, as well as [[transfer of technology]] to developing countries; and should provide economic and [[technical assistance]] without any [[conditionality|strings attached]].

==Resource allocation mechanisms==
Haggard and Simmons claimed that:
:A number of social mechanisms are possible to affect [[resource allocation]] in any economic order. An authoritative allocation mechanism involves direct control of resources while, at the other end of the spectrum, more market-oriented private allocation mechanisms are possible. Most of the debates within the NIEO occurred over allocation mechanisms, with the southern hemisphere countries favoring authoritative solutions.

==Ideology==
NIEO proposes [[central planning]], as opposed to [[free markets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/selectedpapers/sp49.pdf The New International Economic Order], Harry G. Johnson, professor of economics, Woodwart Court Lecture, Oct 5, 1976, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the (French) [[mercantilist]] idea that international trade would be a [[zero-sum game]] (i.e., causes no net benefits), and on the view that it does not benefit the rich at the expense of the poor. Some American economists challenge the idea of trade as a zero-sum game transaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/selectedpapers/sp49.pdf The New International Economic Order], Harry G. Johnson, professor of economics, Woodwart Court Lecture, Oct 5, 1976, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Virtually no part of the New International Economic Order was implemented. Instead, from the 1980s onward, the Bretton Woods framework would be replaced with the [[Washington Consensus]] and economic [[globalization]] on terms often described as [[neoliberal]]. The economic reach of multinational corporations, rather than being circumscribed, would be expanded significantly. Trade in commodities would shift away from state-dominated cartels towards increasingly financialized markets. The NIEO's emphasis on central planning and state-oriented resource allocation mechanisms would be almost wholly rejected, even amongst the (former) Socialist bloc, in favor of economic liberalization. The formation of the [[World Trade Organization]] and the proliferation of [[free trade agreements]] would compel the reduction of barriers to trade, generally on strictly reciprocal terms.

In Matsushita et al.'s ''World Trade Organization'', the authors explained part of the legacy of the NIEO:

:... tensions and disagreements between developed and developing countries continue: the latter expect a greater degree of special treatment than industrialized countries have afforded them. This demand was expressed comprehensively in the New International Economic Order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States promoted by [[UNCTAD]] in the 1970s. Although the Charter was never accepted by developing [sic] countries and is now dead, the political, economic, and social concerns that inspired it are still present. The Charter called for restitution for the economic and social costs of colonialism, racial discrimination, and foreign domination. It would have imposed a duty on all states to adjust the prices of exports to their imports. The realization of the New International Economic Order was an impetus for developing country support for the [[Tokyo Round]] of trade negotiations. Critics of the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] continue to state that little of substance for developing countries came out of either the Tokyo or [[Uruguay Round]]s.

The NIEO can considered to have something of a spiritual successor in the [[alter-globalization]] movement, which, like the NIEO, owes much to French academic criticism (generally rooted in [[Marxist economics]]) of international trade.

==Criticism of price regulation==
The powerful countries of North America and Western Europe felt threatened by the NIEO and continuously tried to criticize and minimize it; according to economist Professor [[Harry Gordon Johnson|Harry Johnson]], the most efficient way to help the poor is to transfer resources from those most able to pay to those most in need. Instead of this, NIEO proposes that those poor countries that have monopoly power should be able to extort these transfers. In practice such power has caused most harm to other poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/selectedpapers/sp49.pdf The New International Economic Order], Harry G. Johnson, professor of economics, Woodwart Court Lecture, Oct 5, 1976, pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Commanding prices above their [[market price|natural level]] usually reduces consumption and thus causes unemployment among producers. Moreover, [[price regulation]] typically gives the extra income to those in control of who is allowed to produce, e.g., to governments or land-owners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/selectedpapers/sp49.pdf The New International Economic Order], Harry G. Johnson, professor of economics, Woodwart Court Lecture, Oct 5, 1976, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tandem Aero''' is a passenger charter airline based in [[Chişinău]], Moldova. It was established in 1998 and transported 24,700 passengers in 2008.

The flights to Kiev were operated with Antonov An-24 until March 2006. Due to air traffic disputes between Moldova and Ukraine the service was halted. After a long period without flights, Tandem Aero flew again to Kiev on 31.08.2006 with an Air Moldova Embraer 120. Later for some time Tandem Aero switched to its Antonov 24RV. As Moldova did not allow Aerosvit to fly on the route Chisinau-Kiev, Ukraine denied Tandem Aero the continuation of its service on this route starting February 6, 2007.

In February 2015, [[Air Moldova]] ended its leasing contract with Tandem Aero. Therefore, the [[Embraer EMB-120]] used for it has been phased out while the three operated routes to [[Sochi]], [[Bucharest]] and [[Kiev]] were terminated.&lt;ref&gt;http://ch-aviation.com/portal/news/36203-air-moldova-ends-embraer-120-operations&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fleet ==
Tandem Aero operates aircraft leased from [[Air Moldova]], as of July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/Tandem%20Aero.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2134">'''Umchwasho''' is a [[tradition]]al [[sexual abstinence|chastity]] [[rite]] in [[Swaziland]].  While the rite is active, unmarried women are not allowed to have sexual relations and must wear a traditional set of tassels.  The tassels are usually made of [[wool]] and are worn around the neck like a [[scarf]].  Girls aged 18 and under must wear blue-and-yellow tassels and are not allowed any physical contact with males.  Those aged 19 or over must wear red-and-black tassels and are allowed some physical contact with males but not [[sexual intercourse]].  Those that are caught going against umchwasho are fined one animal (typically a cow).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/30/aids.andrewmeldrum King comes courting 20,000 virgin dancers], guardian.co.uk, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent period of umchwasho ran between 9 September 2001 and 19 August 2005.  [[Mswati III of Swaziland|King Mswati III]] imposed the ban in an effort to help stop the spread of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]], which is particularly prevalent in the country.  It was originally intended to last five years but was withdrawn one year early without any stated reason, though the ban had faced strong opposition and many women refused to wear the required woollen scarf.  The King also drew criticism when he married a teen during the period, fining himself one cow for breaking the rules.  When the rite ended, the tassels were burnt in a large ceremony.
