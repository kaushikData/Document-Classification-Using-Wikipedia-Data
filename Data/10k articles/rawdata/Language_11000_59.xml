'''Akalanka''' (also known as ''Akalank Deva'' and ''Bhatta Akalanka'') was a famous Jain logician whose [[Sanskrit]]-language works are seen as landmarks in Indian logic.&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ganga Ram Garg |title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjDcd0cTFxQC&amp;pg=PA288 |year=1992 |publisher=Concept |isbn=978-81-7022-375-7 |page=288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived from 720-780 A.D. and belonged to the [[Digambara]] sect of [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=64HXAAAAMAAJ|title=The Enlightened Vision of the Self|isbn=9788170272441|author1=Akalaṅka|first1=|last2=Goyal|first2=Devendra Kumar|date=2005-01-01|p=1,2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Singh|Baruah|2003|p=9}} His work ''Astasati'', a commentary on ''[[Aptamimamsa]]'' of [[Acharya Samantabhadra]] deals mainly with ''jaina'' logic. He was a contemporary of [[Rashtrakuta]] king [[Krishna I]]. He is the author of Tattvārtharājavārtika, a commentary on major Jain text ''[[Tattvartha Sutra]]''. He greatly contributed to the development of the philosophy of ''[[Anekantavada]]'' and is therefore called the "Master of Jain logic".{{sfn|Singh|Baruah|2003|p=110}}{{sfn|Singh|Mishra|2007|pp=9–13}}

==Biography==
The great eighth-century logician Akalanka was aware of the contents of the ''Angas'', although it cannot be said whether they represent an idea rather than a reality for him, and he also seems to have been the first [[Digambara]] to have introduced as a valid form of scriptural classification the division into ''kalika'' and ''utkalika'' texts which was also employed by the [[Svetambara]]s.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=80}}

[[File:Quranic-arabic-corpus.png|right|upright=1.8|thumb|Visualization of Arabic grammar from the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus]]]]
'''Arabic grammar''' ({{lang-ar|اَلنَّحْو اَلْعَرَبِي}} ''{{transl|ar|an-naḥw al-‘arabī}}'' or {{lang|ar|قَوَاعِد اَللُّغَة اَلْعَرَبِيَّة}} ''{{transl|ar|qawā‘id al-lughah al-‘arabīyah}}'') is the grammar of the [[Arabic language]].  Arabic is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] and its grammar has many similarities with the [[Semitic languages#Grammar|grammar of other Semitic languages]].

The article focuses both on the grammar of [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] (i.e. [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]], which have largely the same grammar) and of the colloquial spoken [[varieties of Arabic]].  The grammar of the two types is largely similar in its particulars.  Generally, the grammar of Classical Arabic is described first, followed by the areas in which the colloquial variants tend to differ (note that not all colloquial variants have the same grammar).  

The largest differences between the classical/standard and the colloquial Arabic are the loss of [[morpheme|morphological markings]] of [[grammatical case]]; changes in [[word order]], an overall shift towards a more [[analytic language|analytic]] morphosyntax, the loss of the previous system of [[grammatical mood]], along with the evolution of a new system; the loss of the inflected [[passive voice]], except in a few relic varieties; restriction in the use of the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] and (for most varieties) the loss of the feminine [[plural]]. Many Arabic dialects, [[Maghrebi Arabic]] in particular also have significant [[vowel shift]]s and unusual [[consonant cluster]]s. Unlike other dialects, in [[Maghrebi Arabic]] first person singular verbs begin with a n- (ن).

==History==
The identity of the oldest Arabic grammarian is disputed; some sources state that it was [[Abu-Aswad al-Du'ali]], who established [[diacritical]] marks and vowels for [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the mid-600s, though none of his works have survived.&lt;ref name=kojiro&gt;[[Kojiro Nakamura]], "Ibn Mada's Criticism of Arab Grammarians." ''Orient'', v. 10, pgs. 89-113. 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Others have said that the earliest grammarian would have been [[Ibn Abi Ishaq]] (died AD 735/6, [[Islamic calendar|AH]] 117).&lt;ref name=mon&gt;Monique Bernards, "Pioneers of Arabic Linguistic Studies." Taken from In the Shadow of Arabic: The Centrality of Language to Arabic Culture, pg. 213. Ed. Bilal Orfali. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2011. {{ISBN|9789004215375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools of [[Basra]] and [[Kufa]] further developed grammatical rules in the late 8th century with the rapid rise of Islam.&lt;ref name="goodchild"&gt;Goodchild, Philip. ''Difference in Philosophy of Religion'', 2003. Page 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="old"&gt;[[Archibald Sayce]], ''Introduction to the Science of Language''. Pg. 28, 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; From the school of Basra, generally regarded as being founded by [[Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala'|Abu Amr ibn al-Ala]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/38758/al-Asmai#ref190690 al-Aṣmaʿī] at the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]. ©2013 [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]. Accessed 10 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; two representatives laid important foundations for the field: [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]] authored the first Arabic dictionary and book of Arabic [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and his student [[Sibawayh]] authored the first book on theories of Arabic grammar.&lt;ref name=kojiro/&gt; From the school of Kufa, [[Al-Ru'asi]] is universally acknowledged as the founder, though his own writings are considered lost,&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], vol. 5, pg. 174, fascicules 81-82. Eds. [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]], E. van Donzel, [[Bernard Lewis]] and [[Charles Pellat]]. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1980. {{ISBN|9789004060562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arik Sadan, ''The Subjunctive Mood in Arabic Grammatical Thought'', pg. 339. Volume 66 of Studies in Semitic Languages and Linguistics. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2012. {{ISBN|9789004232952}}&lt;/ref&gt; with most of the school's development undertaken by later authors. The efforts of al-Farahidi and [[Sibawayh]] consolidated Basra's reputation as the analytic school of grammar, while the Kufan school was regarded as the guardian of [[Arabic poetry]] and [[Arab culture]].&lt;ref name=mon/&gt; The differences were polarizing in some cases, with early Muslim scholar [[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi]] favoring the Kufan school due to its concern with poetry as a primary source.&lt;ref&gt;"Sibawayh, His Kitab, and the Schools of Basra and Kufa." Taken from ''Changing Traditions: Al-Mubarrad's Refutation of Sībawayh and the Subsequent Reception of the Kitāb'', pg. 12. Volume 23 of Studies in Semitic Languages and Linguistics. Ed. Monique Bernards. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. {{ISBN|9789004105959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Arabic grammars were more or less lists of rules, without the detailed explanations which would be added in later centuries. The earliest schools were different not only in some of their views on grammatical disputes, but also their emphasis. The school of Kufa excelled in Arabic poetry and [[tafsir|exegesis]] of the [[Qur'an]], in addition to [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and Arab genealogy. The more rationalist school of Basra, on the other hand, focused more on the formal study of grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb]], ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', pg. 350. Leiden: Brill Archive, 1954. New edition 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Division==
For classical Arabic grammarians, the grammatical sciences are divided into five branches:

*''{{transl|ar|al-lughah}}'' {{lang|ar|اَللُّغَة}} (language/[[lexicon]]) concerned with collecting and explaining [[vocabulary]].
*''{{transl|ar|at-taṣrīf}}'' {{lang|ar|اَلتَّصْرِيف}} ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]) determining the form of the individual words.
*''{{transl|ar|an-naḥw}}'' {{lang|ar|اَلنَّحْو}} ([[syntax]]) primarily concerned with [[inflection]] (''[[ʾIʿrab|{{transl|ar|i‘rāb}}]]'').
*''{{transl|ar|al-ishtiqāq}}'' {{lang|ar|اَلاشْتِقَاق}} ([[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]) examining the origin of the words.
*''{{transl|ar|al-balāghah}}'' {{lang|ar|اَلْبَلَاغَة}} ([[rhetoric]]) which elucidates stylistic quality, or eloquence.

The grammar or grammars of contemporary [[varieties of Arabic]] are a different question. [[El-Said Badawi|Said M. Badawi]], an expert on Arabic grammar, divided Arabic grammar into five different types based on the speaker's level of [[literacy]] and the degree to which the speaker deviated from [[Classical Arabic]]. Badawi's five types of grammar from the most colloquial to the most formal are Illiterate Spoken Arabic ({{lang|ar|عَامِّيَّة اَلْأُمِّيِّين}} {{transl|ar|‘āmmīyat al-ummiyyīn}}), Semi-literate Spoken Arabic ({{lang|ar|عَامِّيَّة اَلْمُتَنَوِّرِين}} {{transl|ar|‘āmmīyat al-mutanawwirīn}}), Educated Spoken Arabic ({{lang|ar|عَامِّيَّة اَلْمُثَقَّفِين}} {{transl|ar|‘āmmīyat al-muthaqqafīn}}), [[Modern Standard Arabic]] ({{lang|ar|فُصْحَى اَلْعَصْر}} {{transl|ar|fuṣḥá l-‘aṣr}}), and [[Classical Arabic]] ({{lang|ar|فُصْحَى اَلتُّرَاث}} {{transl|ar|fuṣḥá t-turāth}}).&lt;ref&gt;Alaa Elgibali and El-Said M. Badawi. ''Understanding Arabic: Essays in Contemporary Arabic Linguistics in Honor of El-Said M. Badawi'', 1996. Page 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
{{main article|Arabic phonology}}
Classical Arabic has 28 [[consonant]]al [[phoneme]]s, including two [[semi-vowel]]s, which constitute the [[Arabic alphabet]].

It also has six [[vowel]] phonemes (three short vowels and three long vowels). These appear as various [[allophone]]s, depending on the preceding consonant. Short vowels are not usually represented in the written language, although they may be indicated with diacritics.

Word stress varies from one Arabic dialect to another. A rough rule for word-stress in Classical Arabic is that it falls on the penultimate [[syllable]] of a word if that syllable is closed, and otherwise on the antepenultimate.&lt;ref&gt;Kees Versteegh, ''The Arabic Language'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{transl|ar|Hamzat al-waṣl}}'' ({{lang|ar|هَمْزَة اَلْوَصْل}}), elidable ''hamza'', is a phonetic object prefixed to the beginning of a word for ease of pronunciation, since [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] doesn't allow consonant clusters at the beginning of a word. Elidable ''hamza'' drops out as a vowel, if a word is preceding it. This word will then produce an ending vowel, "helping vowel" to facilitate pronunciation. This short vowel may be, depending on the preceding vowel, a ''{{transl|ar|fatḥah}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|فَتْحَة}}:  {{lang|ar|ـَ}}&amp;thinsp;), pronounced as {{IPA|/a/}}; a ''{{transl|ar|kasrah}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|كَسْرَة}}:  {{lang|ar|ـِ}}&amp;thinsp;), pronounced as {{IPA|/i/}}; or a ''{{transl|ar|ḍammah}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|ضَمَّة}}:  {{lang|ar|ـُ}}&amp;thinsp;), pronounced as {{IPA|/u/}}. If the preceding word ends in a ''{{transl|ar|sukūn}}'' ({{lang|ar|سُكُون}}), meaning that it is not followed by a short vowel, the ''{{transl|ar|hamzat al-waṣl}}'' assumes a ''{{transl|ar|kasrah}}'' {{IPA|/i/}}. The symbol {{lang|ar|ـّ}} ({{rtl-lang|ar|شَدَّة}} ''{{transl|ar|shaddah}}'') indicates [[gemination]] or consonant doubling. See more in [[Tashkīl]].

==Nouns and adjectives==
{{main article|Arabic nouns and adjectives}}
In [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA), nouns and adjectives are  [[Declension|declined]], according to [[grammatical case|case]] (''[[ʾIʿrab|{{transl|ar|i‘rāb}}]]''), [[grammatical state|state]] (definiteness), [[grammatical gender|gender]] and [[grammatical number|number]]. In colloquial or [[spoken Arabic]], there are a number of simplifications such as the loss of certain final vowels and the loss of case. A number of derivational processes exist for forming new nouns and adjectives. Adverbs can be formed from adjectives.

==Pronouns==

=== Personal pronouns ===
In Arabic, [[personal pronoun]]s have 12 forms. In singular and plural, the 2nd and 3rd persons have separate [[masculine gender|masculine]] and [[feminine gender|feminine]] forms, while the 1st person does not. In the dual, there is no 1st person, and only a single form for each 2nd and 3rd person. Traditionally, the pronouns are listed in the order 3rd, 2nd, 1st.

{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="2" | Person

! colspan="2" | 1st

|-

|-

| {{wikt-lang|ar|أَنْتِ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|anti}}''
| {{wikt-lang|ar|أَنْتُنَّ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|antunna}}''
|-
! rowspan="2" | 3rd

| {{wikt-lang|ar|هُوَ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|huwa}}''
| rowspan="2" | {{wikt-lang|ar|هُمَا}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|humā}}''
| {{wikt-lang|ar|هُمْ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|hum}}''
|-
! &lt;small&gt;feminine&lt;/small&gt;
| {{wikt-lang|ar|هِيَ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|hiya}}''
| {{wikt-lang|ar|هُنَّ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|hunna}}''
|}

Informal Arabic tends to avoid the dual forms ''{{transl|ar|antumā}}'' {{lang|ar|أَنْتُمَا}} and ''{{transl|ar|humā}}'' {{lang|ar|هُمَا}}.  The feminine plural forms ''{{transl|ar|antunna}}'' {{lang|ar|أَنْتُنَّ}} and ''{{transl|ar|hunna}}'' {{lang|ar|هُنَّ}} are likewise avoided, except by speakers of conservative colloquial varieties that still possess separate feminine plural pronouns.

==== Enclitic pronouns ====
[[Enclitic]] forms of personal pronouns ({{lang|ar|اَلضَّمَائِر الْمُتَّصِلَة}} ''{{transl|ar|aḍ-ḍamā’ir al-muttaṣilah}}'') are affixed to various parts of speech, with varying meanings:
* To the [[construct state]] of nouns, where they have the meaning of possessive demonstratives, e.g. "my, your, his"
* To verbs, where they have the meaning of direct object pronouns, e.g. "me, you, him"
* To prepositions, where they have the meaning of objects of the prepositions, e.g. "to me, to you, to him"
* To conjunctions and particles like {{lang|ar|أَنَّ}} ''{{transl|ar|anna}}'' "that ...", {{lang|ar|لِأَنَّ}} ''{{transl|ar|li-anna}}'' "because ...", {{lang|ar|وَ)لٰكِنَّ)}} ''{{transl|ar|(wa)lākinna}}'' "but ...", {{lang|ar|إِنَّ}} ''{{transl|ar|inna}}'' (topicalizing particle), where they have the meaning of subject pronouns, e.g. "because I ...", "because you ...", "because he ...". (These particles are known in Arabic as ''{{transl|ar|akhawāt inna}}'' {{lang|ar|أَخَوَات إِنَّ}} ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "sisters of ''{{transl|ar|inna}}''".)
* If the personal pronoun ''-ī'' is added to a word ending in a vowel (e.g. {{lang|ar|رَأَيْتَ}} ''{{transl|ar|raʼayta}}'' "you saw"), an extra ''-n-'' is added between the word and the enclitic form to avoid a hiatus between the two vowels ({{lang|ar|رَأَيْتَـــنِي}} ''{{transl|ar|raʼayta-nī}}'' "you saw me").

Most of them are clearly related to the full personal pronouns.

===== Variant forms =====
For all but the first person singular, the same forms are used regardless of the part of speech of the word attached to.  In the third person masculine singular, ''{{transl|ar|-hu}}'' occurs after the vowels ''u'' or ''a'' (''{{transl|ar|-a, -ā, -u, -ū, -aw}}''), while ''{{transl|ar|-hi}}'' occurs after ''i'' or ''y'' (''{{transl|ar|-i, -ī, -ay}}'').  The same alternation occurs in the third person dual and plural.

In the first person singular, however, the situation is more complicated.  Specifically, ''{{transl|ar|-nī}}'' "me" is attached to verbs, but ''{{transl|ar|-ī/-ya}}'' "my" is attached to nouns.  In the latter case, ''{{transl|ar|-ya}}'' is attached to nouns whose construct state ends in a long vowel or diphthong (e.g. in the sound masculine plural and the dual), while ''{{transl|ar|-ī}}'' is attached to nouns whose construct state ends in a short vowel, in which case that vowel is elided (e.g. in the sound feminine plural, as well as the singular and broken plural of most nouns).  Furthermore, ''{{transl|ar|-ū}}'' of the masculine sound plural is assimilated to ''{{transl|ar|-ī}}'' before ''{{transl|ar|-ya}}'' (presumably, ''{{transl|ar|-aw}}'' of masculine defective ''-an'' plurals is similarly assimilated to ''{{transl|ar|-ay}}''). Examples:
* From {{wikt-lang|ar|كِتَاب}} ''{{transl|ar|kitāb}}'' "book", pl. {{lang|ar|كُتُب}} ''{{transl|ar|kutub}}'': ''{{transl|ar|kitāb-ī}}'' "my book" (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|kutub-ī}}'' "my books" (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|kitābā-ya}}'' "my two books (nom.)", ''{{transl|ar|kitābay-ya}}'' "my two books (acc./gen.)"
* From {{wikt-lang|ar|كَلِمَة}} ''{{transl|ar|kalimah}}'' "word", pl. {{lang|ar|كَلِمَات}} ''{{transl|ar|kalimāt}}'': {{lang|ar|كَلِمَتِي}} ''{{transl|ar|kalimat-ī}}'' "my word" (all cases), {{lang|ar|كَلِمَاتِي}} ''{{transl|ar|kalimāt-ī}}'' "my words" (all cases)
* From {{wikt-lang|ar|دُنْيَا}} ''{{transl|ar|dunyā}}'' "world", pl. {{lang|ar|دُنْيَيَات}} ''{{transl|ar|dunyayāt}}'': {{lang|ar|دُنْيَايَ}} ''{{transl|ar|dunyā-ya}}'' "my world" (all cases), {{lang|ar|دُنْيَيَاتِي}} ''{{transl|ar|dunyayāt-ī}}'' "my worlds" (all cases)
* From {{wikt-lang|ar|قَاضٍ}} ''{{transl|ar|qāḍin}}'' "judge", pl. {{lang|ar|قُضَاة}} ''{{transl|ar|quḍāh}}'': {{lang|ar|قَاضِيَّ}} ''{{transl|ar|qāḍiy-ya}}'' "my judge" (all cases), {{lang|ar|قُضَاتِي}} ''{{transl|ar|quḍāt-ī}}'' "my judges" (all cases)
* From {{wikt-lang|ar|مُعَلِّم}} ''{{transl|ar|mu‘allim}}'' "teacher", pl. {{lang|ar|مُعَلِّمُون}} ''{{transl|ar|mu‘allimūn}}'': {{lang|ar|مُعَلِّمِي}} ''{{transl|ar|mu‘allim-ī}}'' "my teacher" (all cases), {{lang|ar|مُعَلِّمِيَّ}} ''{{transl|ar|mu‘allimī-ya}}'' "my teachers" (all cases, see above)
* From {{wikt-lang|ar|أَب}} ''{{transl|ar|ab}}'' "father": {{lang|ar|أَبُويَ}} ''{{transl|ar|abū-ya}}'' "my father" (nom.) (or is it assimilated?),{{Clarify|date=June 2016}} {{lang|ar|أَبَايَ}} ''{{transl|ar|abā-ya}}'' "my father" (acc.), {{lang|ar|أَبِيَّ}} ''{{transl|ar|abī-ya}}'' "my father" (gen.)
Prepositions use ''{{transl|ar|-ī/-ya}}'', even though in this case it has the meaning of "me" (rather than "my").  The "sisters of ''{{transl|ar|inna}}''" can use either form (e.g. {{lang|ar|إِنَّنِي}} ''{{transl|ar|inna-nī}}'' or {{lang|ar|إِنِي}} ''{{transl|ar|inn-ī}}''), but the longer form (e.g. {{lang|ar|إِنَّنِي}} ''{{transl|ar|inna-nī}}'') is usually preferred.

The second-person masculine plural past tense verb ending ''{{transl|ar|-tum}}'' changes to the variant form ''{{transl|ar|-tumū}}'' before enclitic pronouns, e.g. {{lang|ar|كَتَبْتُمُوهُ}} ''{{transl|ar|katab-tumū-hu}}'' "you (masc. pl.) wrote it (masc.)".

===== Pronouns with prepositions =====
Some very common prepositions — including the proclitic preposition ''{{transl|ar|li-}}'' "to" (also used for indirect objects) — have irregular or unpredictable combining forms when the enclitic pronouns are added to them:
{|class="wikitable"
! Meaning !! Independent form !! With "... me" !! With "... you" (masc. sg.) !! With "... him"
|-
| "to", [[indirect object]] || {{lang|ar|لِـ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|li-}}'' || {{lang|ar|لِي}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|lī}}'' || {{lang|ar|لَكَ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|laka}}'' || {{lang|ar|لَهُ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|lahu}}''
|-
| "in", "with", "by" || {{lang|ar|بِـ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|bi-}}'' || {{lang|ar|بِي}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|bī}}'' || {{lang|ar|بِكَ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|bika}}'' || {{lang|ar|بِهِ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|bihi}}''

|-
| "on" || {{lang|ar|عَلَى}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|‘alá}}'' || {{lang|ar|عَلَيَّ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|‘alayya}}'' || {{lang|ar|عَلَيْكَ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|‘alayka}}'' || {{lang|ar|عَلَيْهِ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|‘alayhi}}''
|-
| "with" || {{lang|ar|مَعَ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|ma‘a}}'' || {{lang|ar|مَعِي}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|ma‘ī}}'' || {{lang|ar|مَعَكَ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|ma‘aka}}'' || {{lang|ar|مَعَهُ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|ma‘ahu}}''
|-
| "from" || {{lang|ar|مِنْ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|min}}'' || {{lang|ar|مِنِّي}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|minnī}}'' || {{lang|ar|مِنْكَ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|minka}}'' || {{lang|ar|مِنْهُ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|minhu}}''
|-
| "on", "about" || {{lang|ar|عَنْ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|‘an}}'' || {{lang|ar|عَنِّي}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|‘annī}}'' || {{lang|ar|عَنْكَ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|‘anka}}'' || {{lang|ar|عَنْهُ}}&lt;br /&gt;''{{transl|ar|‘anhu}}''
|}

In the above cases, when there are two combining forms, one is used with "... me" and the other with all other person/number/gender combinations. (More correctly, one occurs before vowel-initial pronouns and the other before consonant-initial pronouns, but in Classical Arabic, only ''{{transl|ar|-ī}}'' is vowel-initial.  This becomes clearer in the spoken varieties, where various vowel-initial enclitic pronouns exist.)

Note in particular:
* {{lang|ar|إِلَى}} ''{{transl|ar|ilá}}'' "to" and {{lang|ar|عَلَى}} ''{{transl|ar|‘alá}}'' "on" have irregular combining forms {{lang|ar|إِلَيْـ}} ''{{transl|ar|ilay-}}'', {{lang|ar|عَلَيْـ}} ''{{transl|ar|‘alay-}}''; but other pronouns with the same base form are regular, e.g. {{lang|ar|مَعَ}} ''{{transl|ar|ma‘a}}'' "with".
* {{lang|ar|لِـ}} ''{{transl|ar|li-}}'' "to" has an irregular combining form ''{{transl|ar|la-}}'', but {{lang|ar|بِـ}} ''{{transl|ar|bi-}}'' "in, with, by" is regular.
* {{lang|ar|مِنْ}} ''{{transl|ar|min}}'' "from" and {{lang|ar|عَنْ}} ''{{transl|ar|‘an}}'' "on" double the final ''n'' before ''{{transl|ar|-ī}}''.

===== Less formal pronominal forms =====
In a less formal Arabic, as in many spoken dialects, the endings ''{{transl|ar|-ka, -ki, -hu}}'' are pronounced as ''{{transl|ar|-ak, -ik, -uh}}'', swallowing all short case endings.  Short case endings are often dropped even before consonant-initial endings, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|kitāb-ka}}'' "your book" (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|bayt-ka}}'' "your house" (all cases), ''{{transl|ar|kalb-ka}}'' "your dog" (all cases).  When this produces a difficult cluster, either the second consonant is [[syllabic consonant|vocalized]], to the extent possible (e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ism-ka}}'' "your name", with syllabic ''m'' similar to English "bottom"), or an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel is inserted (e.g. ''{{transl|ar|isim-ka}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ismi-ka}}'', depending on the behavior of the speaker's native variety).

===Demonstratives===
There are two [[demonstrative]]s ({{lang|ar|أَسْمَاء اَلْإِشَارَة}} ''{{transl|ar|asmā’ al-ishārah}}''), near-[[deixis|deictic]] ('this') and far-deictic ('that'):

The dual forms are only used in very formal Arabic.

Some of the demonstratives (''{{transl|ar|hādhā, hādhihi, hādhāni, hādhayni, hā’ulā’i, dhālika}}'', and ''{{transl|ar|ulā’ika}}'') should be pronounced with a long ''{{transl|ar|ā}}'', although the unvocalised script is not written with alif ({{lang|ar|ا}}). Instead of an alif, they have the diacritic {{lang|ar|ـٰ}} ([[dagger alif]]: {{lang|ar|أَلِف خَنْجَرِيَّة}} ''{{transl|ar|alif khanjarīyah}}''), which doesn't exist on Arabic keyboards and is seldom written, even in vocalised Arabic.

Qur'anic Arabic has another demonstrative, normally followed by a noun in a genitive construct and meaning 'owner of':
{| class="wikitable"

| rowspan="2" | {{lang|ar|ذَوَاتِ، أُوَلَاتِ}}&lt;br&gt;''{{transl|ar|dhawāti, ulāti}}''
|-
! &lt;small&gt;genitive&lt;/small&gt;
| {{lang|ar|ذَاتِ}}&lt;br&gt;''{{transl|ar|dhāti}}''
|}

Note that the demonstrative and relative pronouns were originally built on this word.  ''{{transl|ar|hādhā}}'', for example, was originally composed from the prefix ''{{transl|ar|hā-}}''  'this'  and the masculine accusative singular ''{{transl|ar|dhā}}''; similarly, ''{{transl|ar|dhālika}}'' was composed from ''{{transl|ar|dhā}}'', an infixed syllable ''{{transl|ar|-li-}}'', and the [[clitic]] suffix ''{{transl|ar|-ka}}''  'you'.  These combinations had not yet become completely fixed in Qur'anic Arabic and other combinations sometimes occurred, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|dhāka}}'', ''{{transl|ar|dhālikum}}''.  Similarly, the relative pronoun ''{{transl|ar|alladhī}}'' was originally composed based on the genitive singular ''{{transl|ar|dhī}}'', and the old Arabic grammarians noted the existence of a separate nominative plural form ''{{transl|ar|alladhūna}}'' in the speech of the [[Banu Hothail|Hudhayl]] tribe in Qur'anic times.

This word also shows up in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], e.g. masculine {{Hebrew|זה}} ''zeh'' (cf. ''{{transl|ar|dhī}}''), feminine {{Hebrew|זאת}} ''zot'' (cf. ''{{transl|ar|dhāt-}}''), plural {{Hebrew|אלה}} ''eleh'' (cf. ''{{transl|ar|ulī}}'').

===Relative pronoun===
The [[relative pronoun]] is declined as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Relative pronoun ("who, that, which")
! colspan="2" | Gender
! Singular
! Dual
! Plural
|-
! rowspan="2" | Masculine
! &lt;small&gt;nominative&lt;/small&gt;
| rowspan="2" | {{lang|ar|اَلَّذِي}}&lt;br&gt;''{{transl|ar|alladhī}}''
| {{lang|ar|اَللَّذَانِ}}&lt;br&gt;''{{transl|ar|alladhāni}}''
| rowspan="2" | {{lang|ar|اَلَّذِينَ}}&lt;br&gt;''{{transl|ar|alladhīn(a)}}''
|-
! &lt;small&gt;accusative/genitive&lt;/small&gt;
| {{lang|ar|اَللَّذَيْنِ}}&lt;br&gt;''{{transl|ar|alladhayni}}''
|-
! rowspan="2" | Feminine
! &lt;small&gt;nominative&lt;/small&gt;
| rowspan="2" | {{lang|ar|اَلَّتِي}}&lt;br&gt;''{{transl|ar|allatī}}''
| {{lang|ar|اَللَّتَانِ}}&lt;br&gt;''{{transl|ar|allatāni}}''
| rowspan="2" | {{lang|ar|اَللَّاتِي}}&lt;br&gt;''{{transl|ar|allātī}}''
|-
! &lt;small&gt;accusative/genitive&lt;/small&gt;
| {{lang|ar|اَللَّتَيْنِ}}&lt;br&gt;''{{transl|ar|allatayni}}''
|}

Note that the relative pronoun agrees in gender, number and case, with the noun it modifies—as opposed to the situation in other inflected languages such as [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]], where the gender and number agreement is with the modified noun, but the case marking follows the usage of the relative pronoun in the embedded clause (as in formal English "the man &lt;u&gt;who&lt;/u&gt; saw me" vs. "the man &lt;u&gt;whom&lt;/u&gt; I saw").

When the relative pronoun serves a function other than the subject of the embedded clause, a [[resumptive pronoun]] is required: {{lang|ar|اَلَّرَجُلُ ٱلَّذِي تَكَلَّمْتُ مَعَهُ}} ''{{transl|ar|al-rajul(u) (a)lladhī takallamtu ma‘a-&lt;u&gt;hu&lt;/u&gt;}}'', literally "the man who I spoke with him".

The relative pronoun is normally omitted entirely when an indefinite noun is modified by a relative clause: {{lang|ar|رَجُلٌ تَكَلَّمْتُ مَعَهُ}} ''{{transl|ar|rajul(un) takallamtu ma‘a-h(u)}}'' "a man that I spoke with", literally "a man I spoke with him".

===Colloquial varieties===
The above system is mostly unchanged in the colloquial varieties, other than the loss of the dual forms and (for most varieties) of the feminine plural.  Some of the more notable changes:
*The third-person ''{{transl|ar|-hi, -him}}'' variants disappear.  On the other hand, the first person ''{{transl|ar|-nī/-ī/-ya}}'' variation is preserved exactly (including the different circumstances in which these variants are used), and new variants appear for many forms.  For example, in [[Egyptian Arabic]], the second person feminine singular appears either as ''{{transl|ar|-ik}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|-ki}}'' depending on various factors (e.g. the phonology of the preceding word); likewise, the third person masculine singular appears variously as ''{{transl|ar|-u}}'', ''{{transl|ar|-hu}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|-}}'' (no ending, but stress is moved onto the preceding vowel, which is lengthened).
*In many varieties, the [[indirect object]] forms, which appear in Classical Arabic as separate words (e.g. ''{{transl|ar|lī}}'' "to me", ''{{transl|ar|lahu}}''  'to him'), become fused onto the verb, following a direct object.  These same varieties generally develop a [[circumfix]] {{IPA|/ma-...-ʃ(i)/}} for negation (from Classical ''{{transl|ar|mā ... shay’}}''  'not ... a thing', composed of two separate words).  This can lead to complicated [[agglutinative]] constructs, such as [[Egyptian Arabic]] {{IPA|/ma-katab-ha-ˈliː-ʃ/}}  'he didn't write it (fem.) to me'. (Egyptian Arabic in particular has many variant pronominal affixes used in different circumstances, and very intricate [[morphophonemic]] rules leading to a large number of complex alternations, depending on the particular affixes involved, the way they are put together, and whether the preceding verb ends in a vowel, a single consonant, or two consonants.)
*Other varieties instead use a separate Classical pseudo-pronoun ''{{transl|ar|īyā-}}'' for direct objects (but in [[Hijazi Arabic]] the resulting construct fuses with a preceding verb).
*Affixation of dual and sound plural nouns has largely vanished.  Instead, all varieties possess a separate preposition with the meaning of "of", which replaces certain uses of the [[construct state|construct]] genitive (to varying degrees, depending on the particular variety).  In [[Moroccan Arabic]], the word is ''dyal'' (also ''d-'' before a noun), e.g. ''l-kitab dyal-i'' "my book", since the construct-state genitive is mostly unproductive.  [[Egyptian Arabic]] has ''bitā‘ '', which agrees in gender and number with the preceding noun (feminine ''bitā‘it/bita‘t'', plural ''bitū‘ ''). In Egyptian Arabic, the construct-state genitive is still productive, hence either ''kitāb-i'' or ''il-kitāb bitā‘-i'' can be used for "my book", but only ''il-mu‘allimūn bitū‘-i'' "my teachers".
*The declined relative pronoun has vanished.  In its place is an indeclinable particle, usually ''illi'' or similar.
*Various forms of the demonstrative pronouns occur, usually shorter than the Classical forms.  For example, Moroccan Arabic uses ''ha l-'' "this", ''dak l-/dik l-/duk l-'' "that" (masculine/feminine/plural).  Egyptian Arabic is unusual in that the demonstrative follows the noun, e.g. ''il-kitāb da'' "this book", ''il-bint&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; di'' "this girl".
*Some of the independent pronouns have slightly different forms compared with their Classical forms.  For example, usually forms similar to ''inta, inti'' "you (masc./fem. sg.)" occur in place of ''{{transl|ar|anta, anti}}'', and ''(n)iḥna'' "we" occurs in place of ''{{transl|ar|naḥnu}}''.

==Numerals==

=== Cardinal numerals ===
Numbers behave in a quite complicated fashion. ''{{transl|ar|wāḥid-}}'' "one" and ''{{transl|ar|ithnān-}}'' "two" are adjectives, following the noun and agreeing with it. ''{{transl|ar|thalāthat-}}'' "three" through ''{{transl|ar|‘asharat-}}'' "ten" require a following noun in the genitive plural, but disagree with the noun in gender, while taking the case required by the surrounding syntax. ''{{transl|ar|aḥada ‘asharah}}'' "eleven" through ''{{transl|ar|tis‘ata ‘asharah}}'' "nineteen" require a following noun in the accusative singular, agree with the noun in gender, and are invariable for case, except for ''{{transl|ar|ithnā ‘asharah/ithnay ‘ashara}}'' "twelve".

The formal system of [[cardinal numeral]]s, as used in Classical Arabic, is extremely complex.  The system of rules is presented below.  In reality, however, this system is never used: Large numbers are always written as numerals rather than spelled out, and are pronounced using a simplified system, even in formal contexts.

Example:
: Formal: {{lang|ar|أَلْفَانِ وَتِسْعُ مِئَةٍ وَٱثْنَتَا عَشَرَةً سَنَةً}} ''{{transl|ar|alfāni wa-tis‘u mi’atin wa-thnatā ‘asharatan sanatan}}'' "2,912 years"
: Formal: {{lang|ar|بَعْدَ أَلْفَيْنِ وَتِسْعِ مِئَةٍ وَٱثْنَتَيْ عَشَرَةً سَنَةً}} ''{{transl|ar|ba‘da alfayni wa-tis‘i mi’atin wa-thnatay ‘asharatan sanatan}}'' "after 2,912 years"

Cardinal numerals ({{lang|ar|اَلْأَعْدَاد اَلْأَصْلِيَّة}} ''{{transl|ar|al-a‘dād al-aṣlīyah}}'') from 0-10. Zero is ''ṣifr'', from which the words "[[cipher]]" and "[[0 (number)|zero]]" are ultimately derived.

The endings in brackets are dropped in less formal Arabic and in pausa. {{lang|ar|ة}} ({{transl|ar|tā’ marbūṭah}}) is pronounced as simple {{IPA|/a/}} in these cases. If a noun ending in {{lang|ar|ة}} is the first member of an [[idafa]], the {{lang|ar|ة}} is pronounced as {{IPA|/at/}}, while the rest of the ending is not pronounced.

{{lang|ar|اِثْنَانِ}} ''{{transl|ar|ithnān(i)}}'' is changed to {{lang|ar|اِثْنَيْنِ}} ''{{transl|ar|ithnayn(i)}}'' in oblique cases. This form is also commonly used in a less formal Arabic in the nominative case.

The numerals 1 and 2 are adjectives. Thus they follow the noun and agree with gender.

Numerals 3–10 have a peculiar rule of agreement known as polarity: A feminine referrer agrees with a numeral in masculine gender and vice versa, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|thalāthu fatayātin}}'' ({{lang|ar|ثَلَاثُ فَتَيَاتٍ}}) "three girls".  The noun counted takes indefinite genitive plural (as the attribute in a genitive construct).

Numerals 11 and 13–19 are indeclinable for case, perpetually in the accusative. Numbers 11 and 12 show gender agreement in the ones, and 13-19 show polarity in the ones. Number 12 also shows case agreement, reminiscent of the dual. The gender of {{lang|ar|عَشَر}} in numbers 11-19 agrees with the counted noun (unlike the standalone numeral 10 which shows polarity). The counted noun takes indefinite accusative singular.

Unitary numbers from 20 on (i.e. 20, 30, ... 90, 100, 1000, 1000000, etc.) behave entirely as nouns, showing the case required by the surrounding syntax, no gender agreement, and a following noun in a fixed case. 20 through 90 require their noun to be in the accusative singular; 100 and up require the genitive singular. The unitary numbers themselves decline in various fashions:
* ''{{transl|ar|‘ishrūna}}'' "20" through ''{{transl|ar|tis‘ūna}}'' "90" decline as masculine plural nouns
* ''{{transl|ar|mi’at-}}'' "100" ({{wikt-lang|ar|مِئَة}} or {{wikt-lang|ar|مِائَة}}) declines as a feminine singular noun
* ''{{transl|ar|alf-}}'' "1,000" ({{wikt-lang|ar|أَلْف}}) declines as a masculine singular noun

The numbers 20-99 are expressed with the units preceding the tens.  There is agreement in gender with the numerals 1 and 2, and polarity for numerals 3–9.  The whole construct is followed by the accusative singular indefinite.
* 20 ''{{transl|ar|‘ishrūna}}'' ({{wikt-lang|ar|عِشْرُونَ}}) (plural of 10)
* 21 ''{{transl|ar|wāḥidun wa-‘ishrūna}}'' ({{lang|ar|وَاحِدٌ وَعِشْرُونَ}})
* 22 ''{{transl|ar|ithnāni wa-‘ishrūna}}'' ({{lang|ar|اثْنَانِ وَعِشْرُونَ}})
* 23 ''{{transl|ar|thalāthatu wa-‘ishrūna}}'' ({{lang|ar|ثَلَاثَةُ وَعِشْرُونَ}})
* 30 ''{{transl|ar|thalāthūna}}'' ({{wikt-lang|ar|ثَلَاتُونَ}})
* 40 ''{{transl|ar|arba‘ūna}}'' ({{wikt-lang|ar|أَرْبَعُونَ}})

''{{transl|ar|mi’at-}}'' "100" and ''{{transl|ar|alf-}}'' "1,000" can themselves be modified by numbers (to form numbers such as 200 or 5,000) and will be declined appropriately. For example, ''{{transl|ar|mi’atāni}}'' "200" and ''{{transl|ar|alfāni}}'' "2,000" with dual endings; ''{{transl|ar|thalāthatu ālāfin}}'' "3,000" with ''{{transl|ar|alf}}'' in the plural genitive, but ''{{transl|ar|thalāthu mi’atin}}'' "300" since ''{{transl|ar|mi’at-}}'' appears to have no plural.

In compound numbers, the number formed with the last two digits dictates the declension of the associated noun, e.g. 212, 312, and 54,312 would all behave like 12.

Large compound numbers can have, e.g.:

* {{lang|ar|أَلْفٌ وَتِسْعُ مِئَةٍ وَتِسْعُ سِنِينَ}} ''{{transl|ar|alfun wa-tis‘u mi’atin wa-tis‘u sinīna}}'' "1,909 years" 
* {{lang|ar|بَعْدَ أَلْفٍ وَتِسْعِ مِئَةٍ وَتِسْعِ سِنِينَ}} ''{{transl|ar|ba‘da alfin wa-tis‘i mi’atin wa-tis‘i sinīna}}'' "after 1,909 years" 
* {{lang|ar|أَرْبَعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ أَلْفًا وَثَمَانِي مِئَةٍ وَثَلَاثٌ وَسِتُّونَ سَنَةً}} ''{{transl|ar|arba‘atun wa-tis‘ūna alfan wa-thamānī mi’atin wa-thalāthun wa-sittūna sanatan}}'' "94,863 years" 
* {{lang|ar|بَعْدَ أَرْبَعَةٍ وَتِسْعِينَ أَلْفًا وَثَمَانِي مِئَةٍ وَثَلَاثٍ وَسِتِّينَ سَنَةً}} ''{{transl|ar|ba‘da arba‘atin wa-tis‘īna alfan wa-thamānī mi’atin wa-thalāthin wa-sittīna sanatan}}'' "after 94,863 years" 
* {{lang|ar|اِثْنَا عَشَرَ أَلْفًا وَمِئَتَانِ وَٱثْنَتَانِ وَعِشْرُونَ سَنَةً}} ''{{transl|ar|iṯnā ‘ašara alfan wa-mi’atāni wa-thnatāni wa-‘ishrūna sanatan}}'' "12,222 years" 
* {{lang|ar|بَعْدَ ٱثْنَيْ عَشَرَ أَلْفًا وَمِئَتَيْنِ وَٱثْنَتَيْنِ وَعِشْرُونَ سَنَةً}} ''{{transl|ar|ba‘da thnay ‘ashara alfan wa-mi’atayni wa-thnatayni wa-‘ishrīna sanatan}}'' "after 12,222 years"
* {{lang|ar|اِثْنَا عَشَرَ أَلْفًا وَمِئَتَانِ وَسَنَتَانِ}} ''{{transl|ar|ithnā ‘ashara alfan wa-mi’atāni wa-sanatāni}}'' "12,202 years"
* {{lang|ar|بَعْدَ ٱثْنَيْ عَشَرَ أَلْفًا وَمِئَتَيْنِ وَسَنَتَيْنِ}} ''{{transl|ar|ba‘da thnay ‘ashara alfan wa-mi’atayni wa-sanatayni}}'' "after 12,202 years"

Note also the special construction when the final number is 1 or 2:
* ''{{transl|ar|alfu laylatin wa-laylatun}}'' "1,001 nights"&lt;br&gt;{{lang|ar|أَلْفُ لَيْلَةٍ وَلَيْلَةٌٌ}}
* ''{{transl|ar|mi’atu kitabin wa-kitābāni}}'' "102 books"&lt;br&gt;{{lang|ar|مِائَةُ كِتَابٍ وَكِتَابَانِ}}

===Fractions===
'''Fractions''' of a whole smaller than "half" are expressed by the structure ''{{transl|ar|fi‘l}}'' ({{lang|ar|فِعْل}}) in the singular, ''{{transl|ar|af‘āl}}'' ({{lang|ar|أَفْعَال}}) in the plural.
* half ''{{transl|ar|niṣfun}}'' ({{wikt-lang|ar|نِصْفٌ}})
* one-third ''{{transl|ar|thulthun}}'' ({{wikt-lang|ar|ثُلْثٌ}})
* two-thirds ''{{transl|ar|thulthāni}}'' ({{wikt-lang|ar|ثُلْثَانِ}})
* one-fourth ''{{transl|ar|rub‘un}}'' ({{wikt-lang|ar|رُبْعٌ}})
* three-fourths ''{{transl|ar|thalāthatu arbā‘in}}'' ({{lang|ar|ثَلَاثَةُ أَرْبَاعٍ}})
* etc.

===Ordinal numerals===
[[Ordinal numeral]]s ({{lang|ar|الأعداد الترتيبية}} ''{{transl|ar|al-a‘dād al-tartībīyah}}'') higher than "second" are formed using the structure ''{{transl|ar|fā‘ilun}}'', ''{{transl|ar|fā‘ilatun}}'', the same as active participles of Form I verbs:
*m. {{lang|ar|أَوَّلُ}} ''{{transl|ar|awwalu}}'', f. {{lang|ar|أُولَى}} ''{{transl|ar|ūlá}}'' "first"
*m. {{lang|ar|ثَانٍ}} ''{{transl|ar|thānin}}'' (definite form: {{lang|ar|اَلثَّانِيُ}} ''{{transl|ar|al-thānī}}''), f. {{lang|ar|ثَانِيَةٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|thāniyatun}}'' "second"
*m. {{lang|ar|ثَالِثٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|thālithun}}'', f. {{lang|ar|ثَالِثَةٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|thālithatun}}'' "third"
*m. {{lang|ar|رَابِعٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|rābi‘un}}'', f. {{lang|ar|رَابِعَةٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|rābi‘atun}}'' "fourth"
*m. {{lang|ar|خَامِسٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|khāmisun}}'', f. {{lang|ar|خَامِسَةٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|khāmisatun}}'' "fifth"
*m. {{lang|ar|سَادِسٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|sādisun}}'', f. {{lang|ar|سَادِسَةٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|sādisatun}}'' "sixth"
*m. {{lang|ar|سَابِعٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|sābi‘un}}'', f. {{lang|ar|سَابِعَةٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|sābi‘atun}}'' "seventh"
*m. {{lang|ar|ثَامِنٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|thāminun}}'', f. {{lang|ar|ثَامِنَةٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|thāminatun}}'' "eighth"
*m. {{lang|ar|تَاسِعٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|tāsi‘un}}'', f. {{lang|ar|تَاسِعَةٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|tāsi‘atun}}'' "ninth"
*m. {{lang|ar|عَاشِرٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|‘āshirun}}'', f. {{lang|ar|عَاشِرَةٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|‘āshiratun}}'' "tenth"

They are adjectives, hence there is agreement in gender with the noun, not polarity as with the cardinal numbers.  Note that "sixth" uses a different, older root than the number six.

==Verbs==
{{main article|Arabic verbs}}
[[File:Arabic Verb Chart.png|right|200px|thumb|Arabic Verb Chart]]
Arabic verbs ({{lang|ar|فعل}} ''fi‘l''), like the verbs in other Semitic languages, are extremely complex. Verbs in Arabic are based on a root made up of three or four consonants (called a triliteral or quadriliteral root, respectively). The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb, e.g. [[K-T-B|k-t-b]]  'write', q-r-’  'read',  ’-k-l  'eat'. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person and number, in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as mood (e.g. indicative, subjunctive, imperative), voice (active or passive), and [[Derived stem|functions]] such as causative, intensive, or reflexive.

Since Arabic lacks an auxiliary verb "to have", constructions using li-, ‘inda, and ma‘a with the pronominal suffixes are used to describe possession. For example: {{lang|ar|عنده بيت}} (''ʿindahu bayt'') - literally: At him (is) a house. → He has a house.

For the negation of Arabic verbs, see [[Negation in Arabic]].

There are two types of prepositions, based on whether they arise from the [[Semitic root|triconsonantal roots system]] or not. There are ten 'true prepositions' ({{lang|ar|حُرُوف اَلْجَرّ}} ''{{transl|ar|ḥurūf al-jarr}}'') that do not stem from the triconsonantal roots. These true prepositions cannot have prepositions preceding them, in contrast to the derived triliteral prepositions. True prepositions can also be used with certain verbs to convey a particular meaning. For example, {{lang|ar|بَحَثَ}} ''{{transl|ar|baḥatha}}'' means "to discuss" as a transitive verb, but can mean "to search for" when followed by the preposition {{lang|ar|عَنْ}} ''{{transl|ar|‘an}}'', and "to do research about" when followed by {{lang|ar|فِي}} ''{{transl|ar|fī}}''.

The prepositions arising from the triliteral root system are called "adverbs of place and time" in the native tradition ({{lang|ar|ظُرُوف مَكَان وَظُرُوف زَمَان}} ''{{transl|ar|ẓurūf makān wa-ẓurūf zamān}}'') and work very much in the same way as the 'true' prepositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryding|first=Karin C.|title=A reference grammar of Modern Standard Arabic|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521777711|edition=6th printing|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A noun following a preposition takes the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Genitive case|genitive case]]. However, prepositions can take whole clauses as their object too if succeeded by the conjunctions {{lang|ar|أَنْ}} ''{{transl|ar|’an}}'' or {{lang|ar|أَنَّ}} ''{{transl|ar|’anna}}'', in which case the subject of the clause is in the nominative or the accusative respectively.

=== The word {{lang|ar|مَعَ}} - preposition ({{lang|ar|حَرْف}}) or noun ({{lang|ar|اِسْم}})? ===
This is a question that does not have a clear answer: A {{lang|ar|حَرْف}} is by definition {{lang|ar|مَبْنِيّ}}, which means that it always (no matter what position or case) stays the same; e.g., the word {{lang|ar|فِي}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arabic for Nerds|last=Drissner|first=Gerald|publisher=createspace|year=2015|isbn=978-1517538385|location=Berlin, Germany|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a debate going on but most grammarians think that {{lang|ar|مَعَ}} 'with' is an {{lang|ar|اِسْم}} because the word {{lang|ar|مَعَ}} can sometimes have [[nunation]] ({{lang|ar|تَنْوِين}}). For example, in the expression ''They came together'': {{lang|ar|جاؤوا مَعًا}}. That is why {{lang|ar|مَعَ}} is occasionally listed under "semi-prepositions," as {{lang|ar|مَعَ}} treated as an {{lang|ar|اِسْم}} is grammatically speaking a {{lang|ar|ظَرْف مَكَان}} or {{lang|ar|زَمَان}} (adverb of time or place), so called: {{lang|ar|اِسْمٌ لِمَكَانِ الاِصْطِحَابِ أَوْ وَقْتِهِ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arabic for Nerds|last=Drissner|first=Gerald|publisher=createspace|year=2015|isbn=978-1517538385|location=Berlin, Germany|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==

=== {{anchor|iḍāfah|idafah|genitive construction}} Genitive construction ({{transl|ar|''iḍāfah''}}) ===
{{main|iḍāfah}}
A noun may be defined more precisely by adding another noun immediately afterwards. In Arabic grammar, this is called {{lang|ar|إِضَافَة}} {{transl|ar|iḍāfah}} ("annexation, addition") and in English is known as the "genitive construct", "construct phrase", or "annexation structure". The first noun must be in the [[construct form]] while, when cases are used, the subsequent noun must be in the genitive case. The construction is typically equivalent to the English construction "(noun) of (noun)". This is a very widespread way of forming possessive constructions in Arabic,&lt;ref&gt;Karin C. Ryding, ''A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp. 205-24 [§8.1].&lt;/ref&gt; and is typical of a Semitic language.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Pospíšil, '[https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/76386/BPTX_2011_2_11210_0_313970_0_126955.pdf?sequence=1 The Idafa construction in Arabic and its morphosyntactic behaviour]' (unpublished BA thesis, Univerzita Karlova v Praze, 2015), §7.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple examples include:
* {{lang|ar|بِنْتٌ حَسَنٍ}} {{transl|ar|bintu Hasanin}} "the daughter of Hasan/Hasan's daughter".
* {{lang|ar|دَارُ الّسَلاَمِ}} {{transl|ar|dāru as-salāmi}} "the house of peace".
* {{lang|ar|كِيلُو مَوْزٍ}} {{transl|ar|kīlū mawzin}} "a kilo of bananas".
* {{lang|ar|بَيْتُ رَجُلٍ}} ''{{transl|ar|baytu rajulin}}'' "the house of a man/a man's house".
* {{lang|ar|بَيْتُ ٱلرَّجُلِ}} {{transl|ar|baytu r-rajuli}} "the house of the man/the man's house".

The range of relationships between the first and second elements of the ''idafah'' construction is very varied, though it usually consists of some relationship of possession or belonging.&lt;ref&gt;Karin C. Ryding, ''A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp. 206-11 [§8.1.1].&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of words for containers, the ''idāfah'' may express what is contained: {{lang|ar|فِنْجَانُ قَهْوَةٍ}} ''{{transl|ar|finjānu qahwatin}}'' "a cup of coffee". The ''idāfah'' may indicate the material something is made of: {{lang|ar|خَاتَمُ خَشَبٍ}} ''{{transl|ar|khātamu khashabin}}'' "a wooden ring, ring made of wood". In many cases the two members become a fixed coined phrase, the ''idafah'' being used as the equivalent of a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] noun used in some Indo-European languages such as English. Thus {{lang|ar|بَيْتُ ٱلطَّلَبَةِ}} ''{{transl|ar|baytu al-ṭalabati}}'' can mean "house of the (certain, known) students", but is also the normal term for "the student hostel".

===Word order===
Classical Arabic tends to prefer the word order [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]] (verb before subject before object) rather than [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] (subject before verb). Verb initial [[word order]]s like in Classical Arabic are relatively rare across the world's languages, occurring only in a few language families including [[Austronesian languages#Structure|Austronesian]], and [[Mayan languages#Word order|Mayan]]. The alternation between VSO and SVO word orders in Arabic results in an agreement asymmetry: the verb shows person, number, and gender agreement with the subject in SVO constructions but only gender (and possibly person) agreement in VSO, to the exclusion of number.&lt;ref&gt;Benmamoun, Elabbas 1992. “Structural conditions on agreement.” Proceedings of NELS (North-Eastern Linguistic Society) 22: 17-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the subject in the latter two above examples is plural, the verb lacks plural marking and instead surfaces as if it was in the singular form.

Though early accounts of Arabic word order variation argued for a flat, [[Non-configurational language|non-configurational]] grammatical structure,&lt;ref&gt;Bakir, Murtadha. 1980. Aspects of clause structure in Arabic. Doctoral dissertation, Indiana University, Bloomington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fassi Fehri, Abdelkader. 1982. Linguistique Arabe: Forme et Interprétation. Rabat, Morocco, Publications de la Faculté des Lettres et Sciences Humaines.&lt;/ref&gt; more recent work&lt;ref name="Benmamoun, Elabbas 2015"/&gt; has shown that there is evidence for a VP constituent in Arabic, that is, a closer relationship between verb and object than verb and subject. This suggests a hierarchical grammatical structure, not a flat one. An analysis such as this one can also explain the agreement asymmetries between subjects and verbs in SVO versus VSO sentences, and can provide insight into the syntactic position of pre- and post-verbal subjects, as well as the surface syntactic position of the verb.

In the present tense, there is no overt [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] in Arabic. In such clauses, the subject tends to precede the predicate, unless there is a clear demarcating pause between the two, suggesting a marked information structure.&lt;ref name="Benmamoun, Elabbas 2015"/&gt; It is a matter of debate in Arabic literature whether there is a null present tense copula which syntactically precedes the subject in verbless sentences, or whether there is simply no verb, only a subject and predicate.&lt;ref&gt;Jelinek, Eloise. 1981.

Subject pronouns are normally omitted except for emphasis or when using a participle as a verb (participles are not marked for person). Because the verb agrees with the subject in person, number, and gender, no information is lost when pronouns are omitted. Auxiliary verbs precede main verbs, prepositions precede their objects, and nouns precede their relative clauses.

Adjectives follow the noun they are modifying, and agree with the noun in case, gender, number, and state: For example, {{lang|ar|بِنْتٌ جَمِيلَةٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|bintun jamīlatun}}'' 'a beautiful girl' but {{lang|ar|اَلْبِنُتُ ٱلْجَمِيلَةُ}} ''{{transl|ar|al-bintu al-jamīlatu}}'' 'the beautiful girl'. (Compare {{lang|ar|اَلْبِنْتُ جَمِيلَةٌ}} ''{{transl|ar|al-bintu jamīlatun}}'' 'the girl is beautiful'.) [[Elative (gradation)|Elative]] adjectives, however, usually don't agree with the noun they modify, and sometimes even precede their noun while requiring it to be in the genitive case.

===''’inna''===
The subject of a sentence can be topicalized and emphasized by moving it to the beginning of the sentence and preceding it with the word {{lang|ar|إِنَّ}} ''{{transl|ar|inna}}'' 'indeed' (or 'verily' in older translations).  An example would be {{lang|ar|إِنَّ ٱلسَّمَاءَ زَرْقَاءُ}} ''{{transl|ar|inna s-samā’a zarqā’(u)}}'' 'The sky is blue indeed'.

''{{transl|ar|’Inna}}'', along with its related terms (or {{wikt-lang|ar|أَخَوَات}} {{transl|ar|’akhawāt}} "sister" terms in the native tradition) {{wikt-lang|ar|أَنَّ}} ''{{transl|ar|anna}}'' 'that' (as in "I think that ..."), ''{{transl|ar|inna}}'' 'that' (after {{wikt-lang|ar|قَالَ}} ''{{transl|ar|qāla}}'' 'say'), {{wikt-lang|ar|وَلٰكِنَّ}} ''{{transl|ar|(wa-)lākin(na)}}'' 'but' and {{wikt-lang|ar|كَأَنَّ}} ''{{transl|ar|ka-anna}}'' 'as if' introduce subjects while requiring that they be immediately followed by a noun in the accusative case, or an attached pronominal suffix.

=== Definite article ===
{{main|al-}}
As a [[Arabic definite article|particle]], ''al-'' does not inflect for [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical person|person]], or [[grammatical case]].  The sound of the final -l consonant, however, can vary; when followed by a [[Sun and moon letters|sun letter]] such as t, d, r, s, n and a few others, it is replaced by the sound of the initial consonant of the following noun, thus doubling it.  For example: for "the Nile", one does not say ''al-Nīl'', but ''an-Nīl''. When followed by a [[Sun and moon letters|moon letter]], like m-, no replacement occurs, as in ''al-masjid'' ("the mosque"). This affects only the pronunciation and not the spelling of the article.

=== Dynasty or family ===

Some people, especially in [[Arabia]] region, when descendant of a famous ancestor, start their last name with {{lang|ar|آل}}, a [[noun]] meaning "family" or "clan", like the dynasty [[Al Saud]] (family of Saud) or [[Al ash-Sheikh]] (family of the Sheikh). {{lang|ar|آل}} is distinct from the [[Al-|definite article ال]].

===Other===
Object pronouns are [[clitic]]s and are attached to the verb; e.g., {{lang|ar|أَرَاهَا}} ''{{transl|ar|arā-hā}}''  'I see her'.  Possessive pronouns are likewise attached to the noun they modify; e.g., {{lang|ar|كِتَابُهُ}} ''{{transl|ar|kitābu-hu}}'' 'his book'. The definite article {{lang|ar|اَلـ}} ''{{transl|ar|al-}}'' is a clitic, as are the prepositions {{lang|ar|لِـ}} ''{{transl|ar|li-}}'' 'to' and {{lang|ar|بِـ}} ''{{transl|ar|bi-}}'' 'in, with' and the conjunctions {{lang|ar|كَـ}} ''{{transl|ar|ka-}}''  'as' and {{lang|ar|فَـ}} ''{{transl|ar|fa-}}'' 'then, so'.

==Reform==
An overhaul of the systematic categorization of Arabic grammar was first suggested by the medieval philosopher [[Al-Jahiz|al-Jāḥiẓ]], though it was not until two hundred years later when [[Ibn Maḍāʾ]] wrote his ''Refutation of the Grammarians'' that concrete suggestions regarding word order and [[Governance (linguistics)|linguistic governance]] were made.&lt;ref&gt;Shawqi Daif, ''Introduction to Ibn Mada's Refutation of the Grammarians'' (Cairo, 1947), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era, Egyptian litterateur [[Shawqi Daif]] renewed the call for a reform of the commonly used description of Arabic grammar, following trends in Western linguistics instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acc.teachmideast.org/texts.php?module_id=1&amp;reading_id=35&amp;print=1 "The Emergency of Modern Standard Arabic,"] by [[Kees Versteegh]].

The user criticised a Malaysian reality TV show ''Explorace'' and compares it with [[The Amazing Race]].]]
'''''Bahasa Rojak''''' ([[Malay language|Malay]] for "mixed language") or '''Rojak language''' is a Malaysian [[pidgin]] (trade language) formed by [[code-switching]] among two or more of the many [[languages of Malaysia]]. ''Bahasa'' means "language", while ''rojak'' means "mixture" in Malay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6cYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Relocation of English: Shifting Paradigms in a Global Era |author= M. Saraceni|page=120 |isbn=9780230296916 |publisher= Palgrave MacMillan|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[rojak|local food of the same name]].

==History==
[[Image:Bahaya.JPG|thumb|200px|Warning signs at Malaysian [[electrical substation]]s still use five of the country's most common languages (top to bottom: Sign Language, [[Malay language|Malay]], [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ([[Traditional Chinese character|traditional]]), [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]).]]
Rojak language of Malaysia can be traced back to 1402, in the early [[Malacca]] of [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]], an international port where more than 80 languages from a variety of cultures were spoken. Worldwide traders, settlers, and original dwellers speaking multiple languages in a conversation was common.

According to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Malaysia]]'' (''Languages and Literature''), it is a [[contact language]], specifically a [[pidgin]], known in modern Malaysia as Rojak language. The uniqueness of Rojak language is in its code-switching style. A person who speaks Rojak language may begin with [[Malaysian language|standard Malaysian]], continue with [[English language|English]], then mix one or two words in [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] garnished with [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and finish with [[Mandarin Chinese]] or some fashionable [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words. During Parameswara's time, when two groups of traders without a shared language met, they would try many possible languages in order to best understand each other, and the result would be a pidgin or ''Rojak''.

In the early 16th century, Portuguese visitor [[Tome Pires]] found in Malacca
{{quote|"Moors from Cairo, Mecca, Aden, Abyssinians, men of Kilwa, Malindi, Ormuz, Parsis, Rumi [Turks living abroad], Turks, Turkomans, Christian Armenians, Gujaratis, men of Chaul, Dabhol, Goa, of the kingdom of Deccan, Malabars and Klings, merchants from Orissa, Ceylon, Bengal, Arakan, Pegu, Siamese, men of Kedah, Malays, men of Penang, Patani, Cambodia, Champa, Cochin China, Chinese, men from Liu Kiu [Formosa] and Brunei, Luzonese, men of Tamjompura, Laue, Bangka, Lingga (and in this area 1000 more Islands are known), from the Moluccas, Banda, Bima, Timor, Madura, Java, Sunda, Palembang, Jambi, Tongkal, Indragiri, Kappatta, Menangkabau, Siak, Arcat, Aru, Bata, from the country of the Tomjano, Pase, Pedir, from the Maldives."}}

These peoples came to Malacca with [[junk (ship)|junks]], pangajavas, and ships, and by 1511, Malacca had a population of 50,000 people, including a resident trade community that spoke 84 languages.

[[Image:RojakSignboard.JPG|thumb|384px|An example of a multilingual signboard in Malaysia]]

The British brought in large numbers of immigrants from China and India from the late 18th to mid 20th century. The presence of local Malays, [[Orang Asli]], [[Peranakan]]s, Portuguese settlers, newly arrived Chinese and Indians, and others resulted in the wide use of mixed language.

==Examples==
* ''Kau memang '''terror''' la!'' - You're really great!
* ''Tempat makan ni '''best''' sangat!'' - This food court is really cool!
* ''Nak makan sini ke nak '''tapau?''''' - Do you want to dine here or take away?
* ''Jangan susah hati '''maa, lu''' punya bos mesti boleh '''kaw tim''' punya '''maa!''''' - Don't worry, your boss can surely compromise!
* '''''Apasal lu''' buat ini kerja '''cincai?''''' - Why do you do this task sloppily?

===Jangan lupa diri===
"Do not forget your roots" or "Jangan lupa diri" is a rallying cry commonly heard among Malaysians interested in protecting their linguistic heritage. This statement suggests that, regardless of race, the Malaysian people have their own roots and ancestral origin to protect. In 2002, Tun Dr. Mahathir proposed that English be 'a tool' to obtain knowledge in the sciences and mathematics, as part of [[education in Malaysia]].

==Controversy==
''Bahasa Rojak'' is widely used, especially by Malaysian urban youths, which has triggered concerns about continued proficiency in the Malaysian and English languages being mixed, and consequent risks to job opportunities for new graduates. The [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian government]] is promoting the use of standard Malaysian, especially in the private sector, and discouraging the usage of Bahasa Rojak, similar to the [[Singapore Government|Singapore Government's]] [[Speak Good English Movement]] and its discouragement of the use of the [[Singlish]] (Singaporean-English) pidgin. For example, Malaysian TV station [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]] in April 2006 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jom Heboh ganti Sure Heboh |url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2006&amp;dt=0313&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Dalam_Negeri&amp;pg=dn_01.htm |accessdate=29 September 2015 |publisher=Utusan Malaysia |date=13 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929020925/http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2006&amp;dt=0313&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Dalam_Negeri&amp;pg=dn_01.htm |archivedate=29 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; changed the name of its carnival ''Karnival Sure Heboh'' to ''Karnival Jom Heboh'' as a result of this concern.

[[Comic]] magazines are often criticized for using Bahasa Rojak. Words or phrases written in Bahasa Rojak are often printed in boldface to enable readers to identify them. By the end of 2003, ''[[Gempak]]'' magazine began using a more formal language style and minimizing use of Bahasa Rojak, including the usage of bold lettering for words deemed colloquial.

During the Standard Malay Language Framework Congress held in November 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zahid harap KSBM tingkat penggunaan Bahasa Melayu|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/berita/nasional/zahid-harap-ksbm-tingkat-penguasaan-bahasa-melayu-1.545751 |publisher=Utusan Malaysia |date=1 November 2017 |accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]] expressed his disappoinment towards the usage of the national language as despite Malaysia has achieved 60 years of independence, there are still many Malaysians (especially Malays) who could not speak proper Malay despite being born and raised in Malaysia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Masih ramai tak fasih bahasa Melayu|url=https://www.bharian.com.my/berita/nasional/2017/11/344484/masih-ramai-tak-fasih-bahasa-melayu|publisher=Berita Harian |author=Mohd Anwar Patho Rohman|date=31 October 2017 |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and follows country’s education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TPM: Malu tidak kuasai bahasa Melayu walau merdeka 60 tahun|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/projekmmo/berita/article/tpm-malu-tidak-kuasai-bahasa-melayu-walau-merdeka-60-tahun#XeTSpIhggC49dCB6.97|publisher=Malay Mail |author=|date=31 October 2017 |accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An-actress-at-her-toilet-or-miss-brazen-just-breecht-john-colley.jpg|300px|thumb|1779 John Colley Playbill of an actress dressing in breeches]]
{{Crossdressing|history}}
A '''breeches role''' (also '''pants role''' or '''trouser role''', ''[[Travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'' or "Hosenrolle") is a role in which an actress appears in male clothing. [[Breeches]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|tʃ|ᵻ|z}}, also "britches"), tight-fitting knee-length pants, were the standard male garment at the time breeches roles were introduced. 

In opera it also refers to any male character that is sung and acted by a female singer. Most often the character is an adolescent or a very young man, sung by a [[mezzo-soprano]] or [[contralto]].&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Budden J. Breeches part. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The operatic concept assumes that the character is male, and the audience accepts him as such, even knowing that the actor is not. Cross-dressing female characters (e.g., Leonore in ''[[Fidelio]]'' or Gilda in Act III of ''[[Rigoletto]]'') are not considered breeches roles. The most frequently performed breeches roles are Cherubino (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''), Octavian (''[[Der Rosenkavalier]])'', Hansel (''[[Hansel und Gretel (opera)|Hansel und Gretel]]'') and Orpheus (''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Euridice]]''), though the latter was originally written for a male singer, first a [[castrato]] and later, in the revised French version, an [[haute-contre]].

Because non-musical stage plays generally have no requirements for vocal range, they do not usually contain breeches roles in the same sense as opera. Some plays do have male roles that were written for adult female actors, and (for other practical reasons) are usually played by women (e.g., ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''); these could be considered modern-era breeches roles. However, in most cases, the choice of a female actor to play a male character is made at the production level; [[Hamlet#Hamlet as a character|Hamlet]] is not a breeches role, but [[Sarah Bernhardt]] once played Hamlet ''as'' a breeches role. When a play is spoken of as "containing" a breeches role, this ''does'' mean a role where a female character pretends to be a man and uses male clothing as a disguise.

== History ==
When the London theatres re-opened in 1660, the first professional actresses appeared on the public stage, replacing the boys in dresses of the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] era. To see real women speak the risqué dialogue of [[Restoration comedy]] and show off their bodies on stage was a great novelty, and soon the even greater sensation was introduced of women wearing male clothes on stage. Out of some 375 plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700, it has been calculated that 89, nearly a quarter, contained one or more roles for actresses in male clothes (see Howe). Practically every Restoration actress appeared in trousers at some time, and breeches roles would even be inserted gratuitously in revivals of older plays.

Some critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, have argued that these [[cross-dressing]] roles subvert conventional [[gender roles]] by allowing women to imitate the roistering and sexually aggressive behaviour of male Restoration [[Rake (character)|rakes]], but Elizabeth Howe has objected in a detailed study that the male disguise was "little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object". The epilogue to [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''Sir Anthony Love'' (1690) suggests that it does not much matter if the play is dull, as long as the audience can glimpse the legs of the famous "breeches" actress [[Susanna Verbruggen|Susanna Mountfort]] (also known as Susanna Verbruggen):

:You'll hear with Patience a dull Scene, to see,
:In a contented lazy waggery,
:The Female Mountford bare above the knee.

Katharine Eisaman Maus also argues that as well as revealing the female legs and buttocks, the breeches role frequently contained a revelation scene where the character not only unpins her hair but as often reveals a breast as well. This is evidenced in the portraits of many of these actresses of the Restoration.

Breeches roles remained an attraction on the British stage for centuries, but their fascination gradually declined as the difference in real-life male and female clothing became less extreme. They played a part in [[Victorian burlesque]] and are traditional for the [[principal boy]] in [[pantomime]].

== Opera ==
Historically, the list of roles that are considered to be breeches roles is constantly changing, depending on the tastes of the opera-going public. In early Italian opera, many leading operatic roles were assigned to a [[castrato]], a male castrated before puberty with a very strong and high voice. As the practice of castrating boy singers faded, composers created heroic male roles in the mezzo-soprano range, where singers such as [[Marietta Alboni]] and Rosamunda Pisaroni specialised in such roles.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; (See ''[[Serse|Xerxes]]'' below.)

Currently, many castrato roles are being reclaimed by men. As the training and use of [[countertenor]]s becomes more common, there are more men with these very high voices to sing these roles.

Casting directors are left with choices such as whether to cast the young Prince Orlofsky in [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss II's]] ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' for a woman or man; both commonly sing the role. When played by a mezzo, the prince looks like a woman, but sounds like a boy. When played by a counter-tenor, he looks like a man, but sings like a woman. This disparity is made even clearer if, as in this case, there is also spoken dialogue.

The term ''Travesty'' (from the Italian ''travesti'', disguised) applies to any roles sung by the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;Budden J. Travesty. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term is a ''skirt role'', a female character to be played by a male singer, usually for comic or visual effect. These roles are often ugly stepsisters or very old women, and are not as common as trouser roles. As women were not allowed to sing on stage in the [[Papal States]] during the [[Baroque period]], many female operatic roles which premiered in those areas were originally written as skirt roles for [[castrato|castrati]] (e.g. ''Mandane'' and ''Semira'' in [[Leonardo Vinci]]'s [[Artaserse (Vinci)|Artaserse]]). Britten's Madwoman in ''[[Curlew River]]'' and the Cook in Prokofiev's ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'' are examples. The role of the witch in Humperdinck's ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', although written for a mezzo-soprano is now more regularly{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} sung by a tenor, who sings the part an octave lower. In the same opera the "male" roles of Hänsel, the Sandman, and the Dewman are however meant to be sung by women.

A '''call centre''' or '''call center''' is a centralised office used for receiving or transmitting a large volume of requests by [[telephone]]. An inbound call centre is operated by a [[company]] to administer incoming product support or information enquiries from consumers. Outbound call centres are operated for [[telemarketing]], solicitation of charitable or political donations, debt collection and [[market research]]. A '''contact centre''' is a location for centralised handling of individual communications, including [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, [[fax]]es, [[live support software]], [[social media]], [[instant message]], and [[e-mail]].&lt;ref name="EWA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ewa-ltd.blogspot.com/2010/03/contact-centre-vs-communication-centre.html |title=Contact Centre vs Communication Centre vs Call Centre |publisher=EWA Bespoke Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A call centre has an open workspace for [[Customer representative|call centre agents]], with work stations that include a computer for each agent, a [[telephone]] set/[[Headphones|headset]] connected to a [[telecom switch]], and one or more supervisor stations. It can be independently operated or networked with additional centres, often linked to a corporate [[computer network]], including [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], [[microcomputer]]s and [[local area network|LANs]]. Increasingly, the voice and data pathways into the centre are linked through a set of new technologies called [[computer telephony integration]].

The contact centre is a central point from which all customer contacts are managed. Through contact centres, valuable information about company are routed to appropriate people, contacts to be tracked and data to be gathered. It is generally a part of company's [[customer relationship management]]. The majority of large companies use contact centres as a means of managing their customer interaction. These centres can be operated by either an in house department responsible or outsourcing customer interaction to a third party agency (known as Outsourcing Call Centres).

==History==
[[File:callcentre.jpg|thumb|A very large call centre in Lakeland, Florida (2006)]]
The origins of call centres dates back to the 1960s with the UK-based Birmingham Press and Mail, which installed Private Automated Business Exchanges (PABX) to have rows of agents handling customer contacts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Science and invention in Birmingham#cite note-45]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.callcentrehelper.com/the-history-of-the-call-centre-15085.htm |title=The history of the call centre |publisher=Call Centre Helper Magazine |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1973, call centres received mainstream attention after Rockwell International patented its Galaxy Automatic Call Distributor (GACD) for a telephone booking system as well as the popularization of telephone headsets as seen on televised [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|NASA Mission Control Center]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-history-of-the-call-center-explains-how-customer-service-got-so-annoying |title=The History of the Call Center Explains How Customer Service Got So Annoying |last=Smith |first=Ernie |date=5 August 2016 |website=Vice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://voxjar.com/call-center-history/ |title=The History of Call Centers Timeline |website=Voxjar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1970s, call centre technology expanded to include telephone sales, airline reservations and banking systems. The term "call centre" was first published and recognized by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 1983. The 1980s experienced the development of [[toll-free telephone numbers]] to increase the efficiency of agents and overall call volume.  Call centres increased with the deregulation of [[long distance calling]] and growth in information dependent industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Bottom-Line Call Center Management |last=Butler |first=David L. |work=Books.google.com |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As call centres expanded, unionisation occurred in [[North America]] to gain members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Pradeep |last1=Kumar |first2=Christopher Robert |last2=Schenk |title=Paths to Union Renewal |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2006 |isbn=1-55193-058-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Communications Workers of America]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwa-union.org/news/entry/Improving_Call_Center_Jobs_a_Top_Priority_for_CWA_Customer_Service_Activist/ |title=Improving Call Center Jobs a Top Priority for CWA Customer Service |publisher=Communication Workers of America |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Steelworkers]]. In [[Australia]], the [[National Union of Workers]] represents unionised workers; their activities form part of the Australian labour movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://workers.labor.net.au/90/news22_call.html |title=Call Centre Union Busters Get Wake-Up Call |publisher=Workers Online |accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Europe]], Uni Global Union of [[Switzerland]] is involved in assisting unionisation in this realm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uniglobalunion.org/uniindep.nsf/callcentres?openpage |title=Uni Global Union's call centre organising campaigns |publisher=Uni Global Union |accessdate=2008-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615190548/http://www.uniglobalunion.org/uniindep.nsf/callcentres?openpage |archivedate=2008-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Germany [[Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft]] represents call centre workers.

During the 1990s, call centres expanded internationally and developed into two additional subsets of communication, contact centres and outsourced bureau centres. A contact centre is defined as a coordinated system of people, processes, technologies and strategies that provides access to information, resources, and expertise, through appropriate channels of communication, enabling interactions that create value for the customer and organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brad Cleveland|Cleveland, Brad]], "Call Center Management on Fast Forward (Third Edition)", ''ICMI Press'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cactus Search"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cactussearch.co.uk/content/clients/roles-we-recruit |title=Cactus Search - List of Call Centre Management Roles We Recruit |publisher=Cactus Search |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129062129/http://www.cactussearch.co.uk/content/clients/roles-we-recruit |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to in-house management, outsourced bureau contact centres are a model of contact centre that provide services on a "pay per use" model. The overheads of the contact centre are shared by many clients, thereby supporting a very cost effective model, especially for low volumes of calls. The modern contact center has developed more complex systems, which require highly skilled operational and management staff that can use [[multichannel marketing|multichannel]] online and offline tools to improve customer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.com/blog/reinventing-customer-service-the-modern-contact-center |title=Reinventing customer service: the modern contact center |last=Viswanathan |first=Ravi |last2=Sandell |first2=Scott |date=21 June 2016 |website=Nea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genesys.com/solutions/contact-center-modernization |title=Contact Center Modernization |last=Staff |year=2016 |website=Genesys.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tmcnet.com/cis/features/articles/301771-history-advancement-the-contact-center-the-customer-experience.htm |title=The History and Advancement of the Contact Center and the Customer Experience |last=Bernier |first=Paula |date=3 August 2012 |website=Tmcnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Call centre technologies include [[speech recognition]] software to allow computers to handle first level of [[customer support]], [[text mining]] and [[natural language processing]] to allow better customer handling, agent training by automatic mining of [[best practices]] from past interactions, [[support automation]] and many other technologies to improve agent productivity and [[customer satisfaction]]. Automatic lead selection or lead steering is also intended to improve efficiencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7035699/description.html |title=US Patent 7035699 - Qualified and targeted lead selection and delivery system |date=2006-04-25 |publisher=Patent Storm |accessdate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125122611/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7035699/description.html |archivedate=2009-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; both for inbound and outbound campaigns. This allows inbound calls to be directly routed to the appropriate agent for the task, whilst minimising wait times and long lists of irrelevant options for people calling in. For outbound calls, lead selection allows management to designate what type of leads go to which agent based on factors including skill, socioeconomic factors and past performance and percentage likelihood of closing a sale per lead.

The [[universal queue]] standardises the processing of communications across multiple technologies such as fax, phone, and email. The [[virtual queue]] provides callers with an alternative to waiting on hold when no agents are available to handle inbound call demand.

===Premises-based technology===
Historically, call centres have been built on [[Private branch exchange]] (PBX) equipment that is owned, hosted, and maintained by the call centre operator themselves. The PBX can provide functions such as [[automatic call distribution]], [[interactive voice response]], and [[skills-based routing]].

===Virtual call centre===
{{see also|Software as a service|Telecommuting}}
In virtual call centre model, the call centre operator pays a monthly or annual fee to a vendor that hosts the call centre telephony equipment in their own data centre. In this model, the operator does not own, operate or host the equipment that the call centre runs on. Agents connect to the vendor's equipment through traditional [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] telephone lines, or over [[voice over IP]]. Calls to and from prospects or contacts originate from or terminate at the vendor's data centre, rather than at the call centre operator's premises. The vendor's telephony equipment then connects the calls to the call centre operator's agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/kapq5p85xnhrwe5b/ |author=M. Popovic and V. Kovacevic |title=An Approach to Internet-Based Virtual Call Center Implementation |publisher=University of Novi Sad, Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual call centre technology allows people to work from home, instead of in a traditional, centralised, call centre location, which increasingly allows people with physical or other disabilities that prevent them from leaving the house, to work. The only required equipment is Internet access and a workstation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nticentral.org/about/articles/nnyt03012006.shtm |author=David S. Joachim |title=Computer Technology Opens a World of Work to Disabled People |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companies are preferring Virtual Call Centre services due to cost advantage. Companies can start their call centre business immediately without installing the basic infrastructure like Dialer, ACD and IVRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Kumar|first1 = Harish|title = Hosted Contact / Call Center Services in Indian Telecommunications Licensing and Regulation|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294894811|website = Researchgate|page = 6|doi = 10.13140/RG.2.1.2931.9445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud computing===
{{Main|Cloud computing}}
Through the use of a[[Application programming interface|pplication programming interfaces]] (APIs), hosted and on-demand call centres that are built on cloud-based [[software as a service]] (SaaS) platforms can integrate their functionality with cloud-based applications for [[customer relationship management]] (CRM), lead management and more.

Developers use APIs to enhance cloud-based call center platform functionality—including c[[Computer telephony integration|omputer telephony integration]] (CTI) APIs which provide basic telephony controls and sophisticated call handling from a separate application, and configuration APIs which enable [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) controls of administrative functions.

===Outsourcing===
{{see also|Outsourcing}}
Outsourced call centres are often located in [[Developing country|developing countries]], where wages are significantly lower. The [[call center industry in the Philippines|call centre industry in the Philippines]] and [[call center industry in the Bangladesh|call centre industry in Bangladesh]] serve as good examples.

Companies that regularly utilise outsourced contact centre services include [[British Sky Broadcasting]] and [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]]&lt;ref name="The Wall Street Journal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livemint.com/2008/11/15003857/Orange-says-outsourced-work-to.html |title=Orange currently outsources work to Indian units of Convergys Corp |publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the telecommunications industry, [[Adidas]] in the sports and leisure sector,&lt;ref name="Adidas - Contact Centres"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewa.ltd.uk/case-studies/adidas |title=adidas setup a dedicated customer care centre |publisher=[[Adidas]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Audi]] in car manufacturing&lt;ref name="Audi chose Confero as an outsourced call centre"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.confero.co.uk/casestudies.htm |title=Audi chose Confero as an outsourced contact centre |publisher=Confero}}&lt;/ref&gt; and charities such as the [[RSPCA]].

==Industries==
===Healthcare===
The healthcare industry has used outbound call centre programmes for years to help manage billing, collections, and patient communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Billing and Collections |url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/section/articles?tagID=13 |website=Modern Healthcare}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inbound call centre is a new and increasingly popular service for many types of healthcare facilities, including large hospitals. Inbound call centres can be outsourced or managed in-house.

These healthcare call centres are designed to help streamline communications, enhance patient retention and satisfaction, reduce expenses and improve operational efficiencies.

===Hospitality===
Many large hospitality companies such as the [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]] and [[Marriott International]] make use of call centres to manage reservations. These are known in the industry as "central reservations offices". Staff members at these call centres take calls from clients wishing to make reservations or other inquiries via a public number, usually a [[Toll-free number|1-800 number]]. These centres may operate as many as 24 hours per day, seven days a week, depending on the call volume the chain receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=RqTgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22central+reservations+office%22&amp;dq=%22central+reservations+office%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizmviI9MfWAhXEwlQKHR1KAbMQ6AEIOjAD|title=Managing Front Office Operations|last=Kasavana|first=Michael L.|last2=Brooks|first2=Richard M.|date=1998|publisher=Educational Institute of the American Hotel &amp; Motel Association|isbn=9780866121798|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==

=== Mathematical theory ===
{{see also|Erlang distribution}}
[[Queueing theory]] is a branch of mathematics in which models of service systems have been developed. A call centre can be seen as a queueing network and results from queueing theory such as the probability an arriving customer needs to wait before starting service useful for provisioning capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gans |first1=N. |last2=Koole |first2=G. |last3=Mandelbaum |first3=A. |doi=10.1287/msom.5.2.79.16071 |title=Telephone Call Centers: Tutorial, Review, and Research Prospects |journal=[[Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=79–141 |year=2003 |url=http://ie.technion.ac.il/Labs/Serveng/files/CCReview.pdf |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Erlang's C formula]] is such a result for an [[M/M/c queue]] and approximations exist for an [[M/G/k queue]].) Statistical analysis of call centre data has suggested arrivals are governed by an [[inhomogeneous Poisson process]] and jobs have a [[log-normal distribution|log-normal service time distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=L. |last2=Gans |first2=N. |last3=Mandelbaum |first3=A. |last4=Sakov |first4=A. |last5=Shen |first5=H. |last6=Zeltyn |first6=S. |last7=Zhao |first7=L. |doi=10.1198/016214504000001808 |title=Statistical Analysis of a Telephone Call Center |journal=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]] |volume=100 |issue=469 |pages=36–50 |year=2005 |url=http://132.68.160.12/serveng/References/statanalysis.pdf |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simulation algorithms are increasingly being used to model call arrival, queueing and service levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://portagecommunications.com/a-primer-on-two-call-center-staffing-methods/|title=A Primer On Two Call Center Staffing Methods for Call Center Workforce Management|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=Portage Communications|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Call centre operations have been supported by mathematical models beyond queueing, with [[operations research]], which considers a wide range of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation problems]] seeking to reduce waiting times while keeping server utilisation and therefore efficiency high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Borst |first1=S. |last2=Mandelbaum |first2=A. |last3=Reiman |first3=M.

== Criticism ==
Call centres have received criticism for low pay rates and restrictive working practices for employees, which have been deemed as a dehumanising environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/ewco/2005/04/SE0504NU02.htm |title=Working conditions and health in Swedish call centres |publisher=[[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions]] |date=2005-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Industry=Call_Center/Hourly_Rate |title=Hourly Rate Survey Report for Industry: Call Center |publisher=[[PayScale]] |accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/lau/lacs/94-2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Advice regarding call centre working practices |publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]] |accessdate=2008-06-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220050612/http://www.hse.gov.uk/lau/lacs/94-2.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research illustrates how call centre workers develop ways to counter or resist this environment by integrating local cultural sensibilities or embracing a vision of a new life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pal |first=Mahuya |author2=Buzzanell, Patrice |title=Breaking the Myth of Indian Call Centers: A Postcolonial Analysis of Resistance |journal=Communication Monographs |year=2013 |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=199–219 |doi=10.1080/03637751.2013.776172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most call centres provide electronic reports that outline performance metrics, quarterly highlights and other information about the calls made and received. This has the benefit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.callcentermagazine.com/shared/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=12803684 |title=The Call Center Answer Team reaches out to the industry for to crack a tough nut |work=Q&amp;A: How Many Calls Should I Monitor |publisher=callcentermagazine.com |date=2003-07-30 |accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; of helping the company to plan the workload and time of its employees. However, it has also been argued that such close monitoring breaches the human [[right to privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acewh.dal.ca/eng/reports/moving6.pdf |format=PDF |title=Who’s on the Line? Women in Call Centres Project |publisher=[[Health Canada]] |work=Atlantic Centre of Excellence for Women's Health |accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints are often logged by callers who find the staff do not have enough skill or authority to resolve problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=873 |title=Tone-deaf to customer complaints, Dell opens yet another call center in India |date=2006-01-30 |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |author=Shaw, Russell |accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as appearing apathetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4738804.stm |title=Abuse rattles Indian call centre staff |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-02-22 |author=Ahmed, Zubair |accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are due to a business process that exhibits levels of variability because the experience a customer gets and results a company achieves on a given call are dependent upon the quality of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, J., Coffman, C., Harter, J.

==Media portrayals==
Indian call centres have been the focus of several documentary films, the 2004 film ''Thomas L. Friedman Reporting: The Other Side of Outsourcing'', the 2005 films ''John and Jane'', ''[[Nalini by Day, Nancy by Night]]'', and ''1-800-India: Importing a White-Collar Economy'', and the 2006 film ''[[Bombay Calling]]'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson | first1 = Dale | year = 2009 | title = Undesirable Bodies and Desirable Labor: Documenting the Globalization and Digitization of Transnational American Dreams in Indian Call Centers | url = | journal = Cinema Journal | volume = 49 | issue = 1| pages = 82–102 | doi=10.1353/cj.0.0164}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Indian call centre is also the subject of the 2006 film ''[[Outsourced (film)|Outsourced]]'' and a key location in the 2008 film, ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]''. The 2014 BBC [[fly on the wall]] documentary series ''The Call Centre'' gave an often distorted although humorous view of life in a Welsh call centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=02:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p018vlpy |title=BBC Three - The Call Centre, Series 1 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-12-10 |accessdate=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1502">'''Courtesy reply mail,''' or '''CRM,''' is a type of mail in which a business sends pre-printed, self-addressed [[envelope]]s or [[postcard]]s to customers, who then affix [[postage stamp]]s to the envelopes or postcards and mail them back to the business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usps.com/replymail/courtesy.htm "Courtesy Reply Mail"], from the USPS {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508211750/http://www.usps.com/replymail/courtesy.htm |date=May 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, the business can disseminate the envelopes or postcards with stamps already affixed, similarly to [[metered reply mail]].

Courtesy reply mail differs from [[freepost|business reply mail]] in the manner of payment of postage, namely, by stamp when the mail is sent, rather than by the permit holder when the mail is received.  Courtesy reply mail is typically used when a response is practically guaranteed, e.g., bill payments.

In the [[United States]], the [[United States Postal Service]] specifies that the envelopes or postcards for courtesy reply mail should be printed with a [[Facing Identification Mark|FIM]] A code.  The [[POSTNET]] bar code can be printed on the envelope or postcard; alternatively, it can be printed on a payment coupon so that the bar code is visible through the window of a window envelope when the payment coupon is inserted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">'''Diarmait Ó Cobhthaigh''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1584) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] poet.

[[Ó Cobhthaigh]] was a member of a hereditary [[bard]]ic family, based in what is now [[County Westmeath]] but was once the heartland of the original kingdom of [[Mide]]. The family were from the district known as [[Fir Thulach]].

Dairmait was the author of a [[lament]] for his murdered relative, [[Uaithne Ó Cobhthaigh]] (died 1556), which begins ''Dá néll orcha ós iath Uisnigh''/''Two clouds of woe over the land of [[Uisneach]]''. His other work included five [[theological]] poems:

* ''Díon cloinne a n-éec a n-athar'' ("Safeguard of children in the death of their father"), which consisted of one hundred and sixty verses.
* ''Fiú a bheatha bás tighearna'' ("The cost of life the death of a lord")
* ''Mairg as aidhne a n-aghaidh breithimh'' ("Alas! the pleader is facing the judge")
* ''Mairg nach taithigh go teacgh ríogh'' ("Alas! that I did not go to the king's house")
* ''Deacair aidhneas earca ríogh'' ("A powerful argument the tributes of a king")

Extant versions of some of these poems are held by the [[Royal Irish Academy]].

{{paranormal}}
Within [[ghost hunting]] and [[parapsychology]], '''electronic voice phenomena''' ('''EVP''') are sounds found on electronic recordings that are interpreted as [[spirit]] voices that have been either unintentionally recorded or intentionally requested and recorded. Parapsychologist [[Konstantīns Raudive]], who popularized the idea in the 1970s, described EVP as typically brief, usually the length of a word or short phrase.&lt;ref name="bretf"/&gt;

Enthusiasts consider EVP to be a form of [[paranormal]] phenomenon often found in recordings with [[white noise|static]] or other [[background noise]]. However, scientists regard EVP as a form of auditory [[pareidolia]] (interpreting random sounds as voices in one's own language) and a [[pseudoscience]] promulgated by popular culture.&lt;ref name="Williams2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F.

==History==
As the [[spiritualism|Spiritualist]] [[religious movement]] became prominent in the 1840s–1920s with a distinguishing belief that the [[spirit]]s of the dead can be contacted by [[medium (spirituality)|mediums]], new technologies of the era including [[spirit photography|photography]] were employed by spiritualists in an effort to demonstrate contact with a [[Spirit world (spiritualism)|spirit world]]. So popular were such ideas that [[Thomas Edison]] was asked in an interview with ''[[Scientific American]]'' to comment on the possibility of using his inventions to communicate with spirits. He replied that if the spirits were only capable of subtle influences, a sensitive recording device would provide a better chance of spirit communication than the table tipping and [[ouija boards]] mediums employed at the time. However, there is no indication that Edison ever designed or constructed a device for such a purpose.&lt;ref name="SkepDic"&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd, ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' 2003, Wiley Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-471-27242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[sound recording]] became widespread, mediums explored using this technology to demonstrate communication with the dead as well. Spiritualism  declined in the latter part of the 20th century, but attempts to use portable recording devices and modern digital technologies to communicate with spirits continued.&lt;ref name="fontana1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fontana | first = David | authorlink = | title = Is There an Afterlife: A Comprehensive Review of the Evidence | publisher = O Books | year=  2005 | location = Hants, UK |url = | doi = | isbn = 1-903816-90-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|352–381}}

===Early interest===
American photographer Attila von Szalay was among the first to try recording what he believed to be voices of the dead as a way to augment his investigations in photographing ghosts. He began his attempts in 1941 using a 78 rpm record, but it wasn't until 1956 — after switching to a reel-to-reel tape recorder — that he believed he was successful.&lt;ref name=senkowski&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worlditc.org/f_07_senkowski_analysis.htm |title=Analysis of Anomalous Audio and Video Recordings, presented before the "Society For Scientific Exploration" USA – June 1995 |accessdate=2007-09-18 |last=Senkowski |first=Ernst |year=1995 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013092253/http://worlditc.org/f_07_senkowski_analysis.htm |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with Raymond Bayless, von Szalay conducted a number of recording sessions with a custom-made apparatus, consisting of a microphone in an insulated cabinet connected to an external recording device and speaker. Szalay reported finding many sounds on the tape that could not be heard on the speaker at the time of recording, some of which were recorded when there was no one in the cabinet. He believed these sounds to be the voices of discarnate spirits. Among the first recordings believed to be spirit voices were such messages as "This is G!", "Hot dog, Art!", and "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all".&lt;ref name="senkowski"/&gt;  Von Szalay and Raymond Bayless' work was published by the Journal of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=brune1&gt;{{cite book | last = Brune | first = Francois | authorlink = | title = The Dead Speak To Us | publisher = Philippe Lebaud | year=  1988 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 2-253-05123-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayless later went on to co-author the 1979 book, ''Phone Calls From the Dead''.

In 1959, Swedish painter and film producer Friedrich Jürgenson was recording bird songs. Upon playing the tape later, he heard what he interpreted to be his dead father's voice and then the spirit of his deceased wife calling his name.&lt;ref name="senkowski"/&gt; He went on to make several more recordings, including one that he said contained a message from his late mother.&lt;ref name="Cardoso 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cardoso | first = Anabela | authorlink = | title = ITC Voices: Contact with Another Reality? | publisher = ParaDocs | year=  2003 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raudive voices===
[[Konstantin Raudive]], a Latvian psychologist who had taught at the [[Uppsala University]], Sweden and who had worked in conjunction with Jürgenson, made over 100,000 recordings which he described as being communications with [[Wiktionary:discarnate|discarnate]] people. Some of these recordings were conducted in an RF-screened laboratory and contained words Raudive said were identifiable.&lt;ref name=bretf&gt;{{cite book | last = Raudive | first = Konstantin | authorlink = Konstantin Raudive | title = Breakthrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication With the Dead (Original title: The Inaudible Becomes Audible) | publisher = Taplinger Publishing Co. |year= 1971 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-8008-0965-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fontana1" /&gt;{{rp|352–381}} In an attempt to confirm the content of his collection of recordings, Raudive invited listeners to hear and interpret them.&lt;ref name=fontana1/&gt;{{rp|353, 496}}&lt;ref name="senkowski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brune1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cardoso 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bander&gt;{{cite book | last = Bander | first = Peter | authorlink = | title = Voices from the tapes: Recordings from the other world | publisher = Drake Publishers | year=  1973 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | asin = B0006CCBAE }}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the clarity of the voices heard in his recordings implied that they could not be readily explained by normal means.&lt;ref name="fontana1"/&gt;{{rp|352–381}} Raudive published his first book, ''Breakthrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication with the Dead'' in 1968 and it was translated into English in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worlditc.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912093308/http://worlditc.org/ |archivedate=2007-09-12 |df= }} Under researchers results - Konstantin Raudive.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiricom and Frank's Box===
In 1980, William O'Neil constructed an electronic audio device called "The Spiricom". O'Neil claimed the device was built to specifications which he received [[psychic]]ally from George Mueller, a scientist who had died six years previously.&lt;ref name=fontana1/&gt;{{rp|352–381}}&lt;ref name=Baruss/&gt; At a [[Washington, DC]] press conference on April 6, 1982, O'Neil stated that he was able to hold two-way conversations with spirits through the Spiricom device, and provided the design specifications to researchers for free. However, nobody is known to have replicated the results O'Neil claimed using his own Spiricom devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wintersteel.com/EVP.html |title=Electronic Voice Phenomena |accessdate=2007-09-20 |publisher=Winter Steel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919105304/http://www.wintersteel.com/EVP.html |archivedate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worlditc.org/h_07_meek_spiri_000_007.htm |title=An electromagnetic-etheric systems approach to communications with other levels of human consciousness |accessdate=2007-09-20 |last=Meek |first=George W |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629013254/http://worlditc.org/h_07_meek_spiri_000_007.htm |archivedate = 2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neil's partner, retired industrialist George Meek, attributed O'Neil's success, and the inability of others to replicate it, to O'Neil's [[Mediumship|mediumistic]] abilities forming part of the loop that made the system work.&lt;ref name="Baruss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meek1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Report from Europe: Earthside instrumental communications with higher planes of existence via telephone and computer are now a reality|journal=Unlimited Horizons, Metascience Foundation Inc|year=1988|first=George W|last=Meek|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–11|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another electronic device specifically constructed in an attempt to capture EVP is "Frank's Box" or the "Ghost Box", created in 2002 by EVP enthusiast Frank Sumption for supposed real-time communication with the dead. Sumption claims he received his design instructions from the spirit world. The device is described as a combination [[white noise]] generator and [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] modified to sweep back and forth through the [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] band selecting split-second snippets of sound. Critics of the device say its effect is subjective and incapable of being replicated, and since it relies on radio noise, any meaningful response a user gets is purely coincidental, or simply the result of [[pareidolia]].&lt;ref name="CSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/franks_box_the_broken_radio/|title=Frank’s Box: The Broken Radio|last=Stollznow|first=Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|date=January 28, 2010|publisher=The Committee For Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=13 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726072215/http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/franks_box_the_broken_radio|archivedate=26 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paranormal researcher [[Ben Radford]] writes that Frank's Box is a "modern version of the [[Ouija board]]... also known as the 'broken radio'".&lt;ref name="Radford 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Radford |first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Investigating Ghosts: The Scientific Search for Spirits |date=2017 |publisher=Rhombus Publishing Company |location=Corrales, New Mexico |isbn=978-0-936455-16-7 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern interest===
In 1982, Sarah Estep founded the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomena (AA-EVP) in [[Severna Park, Maryland]], a nonprofit organization with the purpose of increasing awareness of EVP, and of teaching standardized methods for capturing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association TransCommunication  (Previously known as the AA-EVP)|url=http://atransc.org|publisher=atransc.org|accessdate=23 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130424030901/http://atransc.org/|archivedate=24 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estep began her exploration of EVP in 1976, and says she has made hundreds of recordings of messages from deceased friends, relatives, and [[extraterrestrials]] whom she speculated originated from other planets or dimensions.&lt;ref name="Carroll2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Carroll|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=11 January 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-04563-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC) was coined by Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s to refer more generally to communication through any sort of electronic device such as tape recorders, fax machines, television sets or computers between [[Soul|spirits]] or other discarnate entities and the living.&lt;ref name=Baruss&gt;Baruss, Imants (2001), [http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_15_3_baruss.pdf ''Failure to Replicate Electronic Voice Phenomenon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228125352/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_15_3_baruss.pdf |date=2013-02-28 }}, Journal of Scientific Exploration, V15#3, 0892-3310/01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=itcvoic1&gt;Cardoso, Anabela (2003) "ITC Voices: Contact with Another Reality?"&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly famous claimed incidence of ITC occurred when the image of EVP enthusiast Friedrich Jürgenson (whose funeral was held that day) was said to have appeared on a television in the home of a colleague, which had been purposefully tuned to a vacant channel.&lt;ref name=Baruss/&gt; ITC enthusiasts also look at the TV and video camera feedback loop of the [[Droste effect]].&lt;ref name="CLAUS"&gt;" {{cite web|url=http://www.worlditc.org/h_08_schreiber_0.htm |title=Claus Schreiber, Germany |accessdate=2007-09-21 |publisher=World ITC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/itc.html |title=Skeptic's Dictionary on instrumental transcommunication (ITC) |accessdate=2007-09-22 |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030202147/http://skepdic.com/itc.html |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, parapsychologist [[D. Scott Rogo]] described an alleged [[paranormal]] phenomenon in which people report that they receive simple, brief, and usually single-occurrence [[telephone]] calls from [[ghost|spirits]] of deceased relatives, friends, or strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogo|first=D. Scott|authorlink=D. Scott Rogo|last2=Bayless|first2=Raymond|title=Phone Calls from the Dead|year=1979|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=0-13-664334-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Rosemary Guiley]] has written "within the parapsychology establishment, Rogo was often faulted for poor scholarship, which, critics said, led to erroneous conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary]]. (1992). ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits''. pp. 284-285&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the parapsychologist [[David Fontana]] proposed in an article that poltergeists could haunt tape recorders. He speculated that this may have happened to the parapsychologist [[Maurice Grosse]] who investigated the [[Enfield Poltergeist]] case. However, Tom Flynn a media expert for the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] examined Fontana's article and suggested an entirely naturalistic explanation for the phenomena. According to the skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] "Occasionally, especially with older tape and under humid conditions, as the tape travels it can adhere to one of the guide posts. When this happens on a deck where both supply and take-up spindles are powered, the tape continues to feed, creating a fold. It was such a loop of tape, Flynn theorizes, that threaded its way amid the works of Grosse’s recorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/haunted_tape_recorder/|title=The Haunted Tape Recorder - CSI|website=www.csicop.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109011116/http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/haunted_tape_recorder/|archivedate=2015-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Imants Barušs]], of the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario, conducted a series of experiments using the methods of EVP investigator [[Konstantin Raudive]], and the work of "instrumental transcommunication researcher" Mark Macy, as a guide. A radio was tuned to an empty frequency, and over 81 sessions a total of 60 hours and 11 minutes of recordings were collected. During recordings, a person either sat in silence or attempted to make verbal contact with potential sources of EVP.&lt;ref name="Baruss"/&gt; Barušs stated that he did record several events that sounded like voices, but they were too few and too random to represent viable data and too open to interpretation to be described definitively as EVP. He concluded: "While we did replicate EVP in the weak sense of finding voices on audio tapes, none of the phenomena found in our study was clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings. Hence we have failed to replicate EVP in the strong sense." The findings were published in the ''[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]]'' in 2001, and include a literature review.&lt;ref name="Baruss"/&gt;

In 2005, the ''Journal of the [[Society for Psychical Research]]'' published a report by paranormal investigator Alexander MacRae.  MacRae conducted recording sessions using a device of his own design that generated EVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In an attempt to demonstrate that different individuals would interpret EVP in the recordings the same way, MacRae asked seven people to compare some selections to a list of five phrases he provided, and to choose the best match. MacRae said the results of the listening panels indicated that the selections were of paranormal origin.&lt;ref name=senkowski /&gt;&lt;ref name="macRae1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = MacRae | first = Alexander | authorlink = | title = Report of an Electronic Voice Phenomenon Experiment inside a Double-Screened Room | journal = Journal of the Society for Psychical Research | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = Society for Psychical Research |date=October 2005 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Alpha Mystery |journal=FATE Magazine |date=2000-07-01 |first=José |last=Feola |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/38/ |format= |accessdate=2007-09-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701231855/http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/38/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portable digital voice recorders are currently the technology of choice for some EVP investigators. Since some of these devices are very susceptible to Radio Frequency (RF) contamination, EVP enthusiasts sometimes try to record EVP in RF- and sound-screened rooms.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"&gt;{{cite web | last = Chisholm | first = Judith | title = A Short History of EVP | publisher = Psychic World | year = 2000 | url = http://www.psychicworld.net/EVP3.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-03 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070211082252/http://www.psychicworld.net/EVP3.htm |archivedate= 2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some EVP enthusiasts describe hearing the words in EVP as an ability, much like learning a new language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=You can Hear Dead People |journal=Fate |date=2001-02-01 |first= |last=Konstantinos |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/95/ |format= |accessdate=2007-09-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044750/http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/95/ |archivedate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Skeptics suggest that the claimed instances may be misinterpretations of natural phenomena, inadvertent influence of the electronic equipment by researchers, or deliberate influencing of the researchers and the equipment by third parties. EVP and ITC are seldom researched within the [[scientific community]], so most research in the field is carried out by amateur researchers who lack training and resources to conduct scientific research, and who are motivated by subjective notions.&lt;ref name=Baruss /&gt;

==Explanations and origins==
[[Paranormal]] claims for the origin of EVP include living humans imprinting thoughts directly on an electronic medium through [[psychokinesis]]&lt;ref name="jahn1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jahn | first = Robert G. | authorlink = |author2=Dunne, Brenda J. | title = Margins of Reality: The Role of Consciousness in the Physical World | publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year= 1987 | location = San Diego, California | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-15-157148-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and communication by discarnate entities such as spirits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendly-ghosts.com/faqs.html|title=EVPs - Questions &amp; Answers|website=www.friendly-ghosts.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517150243/http://www.friendly-ghosts.com/faqs.html|archivedate=2008-05-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Group analyzes paranormal activity|journal=The Collegian|date= October 26, 2004 |first=Josh|last=Josh Bosack|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; nature energies, beings from other dimensions, or [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]].&lt;ref name="Voices-ET"&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080618050650/http://aaevp.com/voices_of_eternity_web.pdf Estep, Sarah, "''Voices Of Eternity''," page 144]&lt;/ref&gt; Paranormal explanations for EVP generally assume production of EVP by a communicating intelligence through means other than the typical functioning of [[communication technology|communication technologies]]. Natural explanations for reported instances of EVP tend to dispute this assumption explicitly and provide explanations which do not require novel mechanisms that are not based on recognized [[observation|scientific phenomena]].

One study, by psychologist [[Imants Barušs]], was unable to replicate suggested paranormal origins for EVP recorded under controlled conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Baruss, Imants (2001). "Failure to Replicate Electronic Voice Phenomenon," ''Journal of Scientific Exploration'', Vol. 15, No. 3, pp. 355–367, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Regal]] in ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'' (2009) has written "A case can be made for the idea that many EVPs are artifacts of the recording process itself with which the operators are unfamiliar. The majority of EVPS have alternative, nonspiritual sources; anomalous ones have no clear proof they are of spiritual origin."&lt;ref&gt;Regal, Brian (2009). ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia''. Greenwood. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-0-313-35507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural explanations===

There are a number of simple scientific explanations that can account for why some listeners to the static on audio devices may believe they hear voices, including radio interference and the tendency of the human brain to recognize patterns in random stimuli.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =EVP| work =Skeptic's Dictionary| publisher =| url =http://skepdic.com/evp.html| doi =| accessdate =2006-12-01| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061130171118/http://skepdic.com/evp.html| archivedate =2006-11-30| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recordings may be hoaxes created by frauds or pranksters.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;

====Psychology and perception====

''Auditory [[pareidolia]]'' is a situation created when the brain incorrectly interprets random patterns as being familiar patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins Arthur W. Wynn Charles M. (2001), "Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends and Pseudoscience Begins", National Academies Press, {{ISBN|0-309-07309-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of EVP it could result in an observer interpreting random noise on an audio recording as being the familiar sound of a human voice.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zusne |first=Leonard |author2=Warren H. Jones |title=Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1989 |isbn=0-8058-0508-7 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?visbn=0-8058-0508-7 |accessdate=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shermer|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Shermer|date=May 2005|title=Turn Me On, Dead Man: What do the Beatles, the Virgin Mary, Jesus, Patricia Arquette and Michael Keaton all have in common?|journal=[[Scientific American]]|publisher=Scientific American Inc.|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=turn-me-on-dead-man|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319161949/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=turn-me-on-dead-man|archivedate=2011-03-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The propensity for an apparent voice heard in white noise recordings to be in a language understood well by those researching it, rather than in an unfamiliar language, has been cited as evidence of this,&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt; and a broad class of phenomena referred to by author Joe Banks as ''[[Rorschach inkblot test|Rorschach]] Audio'' has been described as a global explanation for all manifestations of EVP.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Joe Banks "Rorschach Audio", the "Ghost Orchid" CD sleevenotes, PARC / [[Ash International]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Joe Banks "Rorschach Audio: A Lecture at [[The Royal Society of British Sculptors]]", ''Diffusion'' 8, pp. 2-6, [[Sonic Arts Network]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Banks "Rorschach Audio: Ghost Voices and Perceptual Creativity", [[Leonardo Music Journal]] 11, pp. 77-83, The [[MIT Press]], 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Banks "Rorschach Audio: Art and Illusion for Sound", ''Strange Attractor Journal'' 1, pp. 124-159, [[Strange Attractor Press]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics such as [[David Federlein]], [[Chris French]], [[Terence Hines]] and [[Michael Shermer]] say that EVP are usually recorded by raising the "[[noise floor]]" – the electrical noise created by all electrical devices – in order to create [[white noise]].  When this noise is [[filter (signal processing)|filtered]], it can be made to produce noises which sound like speech.  Federlein says that this is no different from using a [[wah pedal]] on a guitar, which is a [[Spectral glide|focused sweep filter]] which moves around the spectrum and creates open vowel sounds.  This, according to Federlein, sounds exactly like some EVP.  This, in combination with such things as [[cross modulation]] of radio stations or faulty [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]] can cause the impression of paranormal voices.&lt;ref name="SkepDic" /&gt;  The human brain evolved to recognize patterns, and if a person listens to enough noise the brain will detect words, even when there is no intelligent source for them.&lt;ref name=shermer&gt;{{cite news |last=Shermer |first=Michael |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man |date=May 2005 |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000EB977-12BE-1264-8F9683414B7FFE9F |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007142218/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000EB977-12BE-1264-8F9683414B7FFE9F |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCHUW"&gt;{{cite news | first=Huw | last=Williams | title='Ghostly' chatter - fact or fiction? | date=2005-01-06 | work=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4152805.stm | accessdate=2007-09-23 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115073641/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4152805.stm | archivedate=2010-11-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expectation also plays an important part in making people believe they are hearing voices in random noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hines, Terence|authorlink =Terence Hines|title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal|page=111|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|year=2003|isbn=1-57392-979-4}} "If one expects to hear voices, constructive perception will produce voices. The voices, not surprisingly, are usually described as speaking in hoarse whispers. The Indians used to believe that the dead spoke as the wind swirled through the trees. The tape recorder has simply brought this illusion into a technological age."&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Apophenia]]'' is related to, but distinct from pareidolia.&lt;ref name="MNAPOP"&gt;" {{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39714 |title=Definition of Apophenia |accessdate=2007-09-23 |publisher=[[MedicineNet]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203747/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39714 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apophenia is defined as "the spontaneous finding of connections or meaning in things which are random, unconnected or meaningless", and has been put forward as a possible explanation.&lt;ref name=phaedra1&gt;{{cite web|last=Phaedra|title=Believing is seeing|work=The Skeptic Express|publisher=|year=2006|url=http://theskepticexpress.com/Believing_is_seeing.php|accessdate=2007-03-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928050048/http://theskepticexpress.com/Believing_is_seeing.php|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the psychologist [[James Alcock]] what people hear in EVP recordings can best be explained by apophenia, [[Intermodulation|cross-modulation]] or expectation and [[wishful thinking]].

====Physics====

[[Interference (communication)|Interference]], for example, is seen in certain EVP recordings, especially those recorded on devices which contain [[RLC circuit]]ry. These cases represent radio signals of voices or other sounds from broadcast sources.&lt;ref name="tipler"&gt;{{cite book | author= Paul Tipler| title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Electricity, Magnetism, Light, and Elementary Modern Physics (5th ed.) | publisher=W. H. Freeman | year=2004 | isbn=0-7167-0810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interference from [[citizens band radio|CB Radio transmissions]] and wireless baby monitors, or anomalies generated through [[cross modulation]] from other electronic devices, are all documented phenomena.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt; It is even possible for [[Crystal radio|circuits]] to [[resonance|resonate]] without any internal power source by means of [[radio receiver|radio reception]].&lt;ref name="tipler"/&gt;

''Capture errors'' are anomalies created by the method used to capture audio signals, such as noise generated through the over-amplification of a signal at the point of recording.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="signal"&gt;Smith, Steven W. (2002) ''Digital Signal Processing - A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists'', Newnes, {{ISBN|0-7506-7444-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital artifact|Artifacts]] created during attempts to boost the clarity of an existing recording might explain some EVP.  Methods include re-sampling, frequency isolation, and noise reduction or enhancement, which can cause recordings to take on qualities significantly different from those that were present in the original recording.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gentile&gt;[[James Randi|Randi, James]] (2006-06-09), ''[http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-06/060906just.html#i1 Just Where is Lou Gentile?],&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first EVP recordings may have originated from the use of tape recording equipment with poorly aligned erasure and recording heads, resulting in the incomplete erasure of previous audio recordings on the tape. This could allow a small percentage of previous content to be superimposed or mixed into a new 'silent' recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/may97/analysinganalogue.html?print=yes|title=More Past SOS Articles coming... -|website=www.soundonsound.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925190009/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/may97/analysinganalogue.html?print=yes|archivedate=2012-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- Original research?  The source does not seem to mention EVP at all --&gt;

====Sporadic meteors and meteor showers====

For all radio transmissions above 30&amp;nbsp;MHz (which are not reflected by the ionosphere) there is a possibility of meteor reflection of the radio signal.&lt;ref name="Harvey&amp;Bohlman"&gt;P Harvey &amp; KJ Bohlman. Stereo radio F.M. Handbook, Chapter 7, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Meteors leave a trail of ionised particles and electrons as they pass through the upper atmosphere (a process called ablation) which reflect transmission radio waves which would usually flow into space.&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;L.A. Manning et al., Determination of ionospheric electron distribution, Proc Inst Radio Engineers Vol 37, pp599-603 (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; These reflected waves are from transmitters which are below the horizon of the received meteor reflection.  In Europe this means the brief scattered wave may carry a foreign voice which can interfere with radio receivers.  Meteor reflected radio waves last between 0.05 seconds and 1 second, depending on the size of the meteor.&lt;ref name="Lovell"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.B.C. Lovell|title=Meteor Astronomy|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that show interest in EVP==
There are a number of organizations dedicated to studying EVP and instrumental transcommunication, or which otherwise express interest in the subject. Individuals within these organizations may participate in investigations, author books or journal articles, deliver presentations, and hold conferences where they share experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atransc.org/resources/aaevp_conference.html|title=2006 AA-EVP Conference - ATransC|date=14 September 2016|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140809174644/http://atransc.org/resources/aaevp_conference.html|archivedate=9 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition organizations exist which dispute the validity of the phenomena on scientific grounds.&lt;ref name=Gentile/&gt;

==Cultural impact==
The concept of EVP has influenced popular culture. It is popular as an entertaining pursuit, as in [[ghost hunting]], and as a means of dealing with grief. It has influenced literature, radio, film, television, and music.

''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'', a 1983 novel by [[William Peter Blatty]], contains a subplot where Dr. Vincent Amfortas, a terminally ill neurologist, leaves a "to-be-opened-upon-my-death" letter for Lt. Kinderman detailing his accounts of contact with the dead, including the doctor's recently deceased wife, Ann, through EVP recordings. Amfortas' character and the EVP subplot do not appear in the film version of the novel, ''[[The Exorcist III]]'', although in Kinderman's dream dead people are seen trying to communicate with the living by radio.

In ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'', a 2003 novel by [[William Gibson]], the main character's mother tries to convince her that her father is communicating with her from recordings after his death/disappearance in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].'

=== Theater and music ===
In ''[[Nyctivoe]]'' a 2001 vampire-inspired play by [[Dimitris Lyacos]] the male character as well as his deceased companion are speaking from a recording device amidst a static/white noise background.

In ''[[With the people from the bridge]]'', a 2014 play by [[Dimitris Lyacos]] based on the idea of the return of the dead, the voice of the female character NCTV is transmitted from a television monitor amidst a static/white noise background.

EVP is the subject of [[Vyktoria Pratt Keating]]'s song "Disembodied Voices on Tape" from her 2003 album ''Things that Fall from the Sky'', produced by [[Andrew Giddings]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].

[[Laurie Anderson]]'s "Example #22", from her 1981 album ''[[Big Science (Laurie Anderson album)|Big Science]],'' interposes spoken sentences and phrases in German with sung passages in English representing EVP.

During the outro to "Rubber Ring" by [[The Smiths]], a sample from an EVP recording is repeated. The phrase "You are sleeping, you do not want to believe," is a 'translation' of the 'spirit voices' from a 1970s flexitape. The original recording is from the 1971 record which accompanied Raudive's book 'Breakthrough', and which was re-issued as a flexi-disc in the 1980s free with The Unexplained magazine.

[[Bass Communion]]'s 2004 album [[Ghosts on Magnetic Tape]] was inspired by EVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/back-catalogue-bass-communions-ghosts-on-magnetic-tape-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816045630/http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/back-catalogue-bass-communions-ghosts-on-magnetic-tape-2/ |archivedate=2016-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band Giles Corey, founded by Dan Barrett composed a song called 'Empty Churches' which features track 2 called 'Raymond Cass', track 36 called 'Justified Theft' and track 38 called 'Tramping' from the album An Introduction to EVP by The Ghost Orchid which features excerpts from different EVP experiments produced by many researchers, although most are unknown, some have been pointed out to be more known researchers who studied EVP recordings including Friedrich Jurgenson, Raymond Cass and Konstantin Raudive.

In 2017 in Poland was published music cd ′′′Katharsis (A Small Victory)′′′ of [[Teatr Tworzenia]] by [[Jarosław Pijarowski]] with background recorded used EVP recordings (second track - „Katharsis – Pandemonium”).

'''Filigree''' (also less commonly spelled ''filagree'', and formerly written ''filigrann'' or ''filigrene''){{cn|date=November 2017}} is a delicate kind of [[jewellery]] metalwork, usually of [[gold]] and [[silver]], made with tiny beads or twisted threads, or both in combination, soldered together or to the surface of an object of the same metal and arranged in artistic motifs. It often suggests [[lace]] and remains popular in Indian and other Asian metalwork. It was popular as well in Italian, French and Portuguese metalwork from 1660 to the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century. It should not be confused with [[ajoure]] jewellery work, the ajoure technique consisting of drilling holes in objects made of sheet metal.

The English word filigree is shortened from the earlier use of ''filigreen'' which derives from Latin "filum" meaning thread and "granum" grain, in the sense of small bead. The Latin words gave ''filigrana'' in Italian which itself became ''filigrane'' in 17th-century French.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionaries'' entry for "filigree" http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/filigree&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Online Etymology Dictionary'' http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=filigree&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Though filigree has become a special branch of jewellery in modern times, it was historically part of the ordinary work of the jeweler. Indeed, all the jewelry of the [[Etruscans]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] (other than that intended for the grave, and therefore of an unsubstantial character) was made by soldering together and so building up the gold rather than by chiselling or engraving the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castellani|first=Alessandro|title=A Memoir on the Jewellery of the Ancients|year=1861|publisher=Jackson and Keeson|url=http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/castellani-memoir/page_001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient work===
Archaeological finds in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] indicate that filigree was incorporated into jewelry since 3,000 BC. Specific to the city of [[Midyat]] in [[Mardin Province]] in upper Mesopotamia, a form of filigree using silver and gold wires, known as "telkari", was developed in the 15th Century. To this day, expert craftsmen in this region continue to produce fine pieces of telkari.

The [[Egypt]]ian jewelers employed wire, both to lay down on a background and to plait or otherwise arranged jour. But, with the exception of chains, it cannot be said that filigree work was much practiced by them. Their strength lay rather in their [[cloisonné]] work and their molded ornaments. Many examples, however, remain of round plaited gold chains of fine wire, such as those that are still made by the filigree workers of [[India]], and known as [[trichinopoly]] chains. From some of these are hung smaller chains of finer wire with minute fishes and other pendants fastened to them.

In ornaments derived from [[Phoenicia]]n sites, such as [[Cyprus]] and [[Sardinia]], patterns of gold wire are laid down with great delicacy on a gold ground, but the art was advanced to its highest perfection in the Greek and Etruscan filigree of the 6th to the 3rd&amp;nbsp;centuries&amp;nbsp;BC. A number of earrings and other personal ornaments found in central Italy are preserved in the [[Louvre]] and in the [[British Museum]]. Almost all of them are made of filigree work. Some earrings are in the form of flowers of geometric design, bordered by one or more rims each made up of minute volutes of gold wire, and this kind of ornament is varied by slight differences in the way of disposing the number or arrangement of the volutes. But the [[feather]]s and petals of modern Italian filigree are not seen in these ancient designs. Instances occur, but only rarely, in which filigree devices in wire are self-supporting and not applied to metal plates.

The museum of the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] at [[Saint Petersburg]] contains a large collection of [[Scythians|Scythian]] jewelry from the tombs of the [[Crimea]]. Many [[bracelet]]s and [[necklace]]s in that collection are made of twisted wire, some in as many as seven rows of plaiting, with clasps in the shape of heads of animals of beaten work. Others are strings of large beads of gold, decorated with volutes, knots and other patterns of wire soldered over the surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;See the "Antiquites du Bosphore Cimmerien", by Gille, 1854; reissued by S. Reinach, 1892, which contains careful engravings of these objects.&lt;/ref&gt; In the British Museum a [[sceptre]], probably that of a Greek priestess, is covered with plaited and netted gold wipe, finished with a sort of [[Corinth]]ian [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] and a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] of green glass.

===Asia===

It is probable that in [[India]] and various parts of central Asia filigree has been worked from the most remote period without any change in the designs. Whether the Asiatic jewellers were influenced by the Greeks who settled on that continent, or merely trained under traditions held in common with them, it is certain that the Indian filigree workers retain the same patterns as those of the ancient Greeks and work them in the same way, down to the present day. Wandering workmen are given so much gold, coined or rough, which is weighed, heated in a pan of [[charcoal]], beaten into wire, and then worked in the courtyard or [[verandah]] of the employer's house according to the designs of the artist, who weighs the complete work on restoring it and is paid at a specified rate for his labour. Very fine grains or beads and spines of gold, scarcely thicker than coarse hair, projecting from plates of gold are methods of ornamentation still used.

[[Cuttack]], of the eastern [[India]]n state [[Odisha]], features traditional filigree work Known as ''[[tarakasi]]'' in the [[Odia language]], most filigree work revolves around images of deities, though due to lack of patronage and modern design ideas, it is a dying art. Also noted is [[Silver Filigree of Karimnagar|silver filigree of Karimnagar]] in Telangana state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/11/11/stories/2004111100760100.htm |title=Arts &amp; Crafts : Wisps of silver |publisher=The Hindu |date=2004-11-11 |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===

[[File:Coracao de filigrana.jpg|thumb|Portuguese filigree heart, Porto]]
Passing to later times, there are in many collections of medieval jewel work [[reliquaries]], covers for [[Gospel book]]s, etc., made either in [[Constantinople]] from the 6th to the 12th&amp;nbsp;centuries, or in monasteries in Europe, in which studied and imitated Byzantine goldsmiths' work. These objects, besides being enriched with precious stones, polished, but not cut into facets, and with [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]], are often decorated with filigree. Large surfaces of gold are sometimes covered with scrolls of filigree soldered on, and corner pieces of the borders of book covers, or the panels of reliquaries, are frequently made up of complicated pieces of plaited work alternating with spaces encrusted with enamel. Byzantine filigree work occasionally has small stones set amongst the curves or knots. Examples of such decoration can be seen in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria and Albert]], and British Museums.  Examples include the [[Cross of Lothair]] in [[Aachen]].

In the north of Europe, the [[Saxons]], [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] and [[Celts]] were from an early period skillful in several kinds of [[goldsmith]]s' work. Admirable examples of filigree patterns laid down in wire on gold, from [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] tombs, may be seen in the British Museum, notably a brooch from [[Dover]], and a sword-hilt from [[Cumberland, England|Cumberland]]. The [[Staffordshire Hoard]] of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver (estimated 700&amp;nbsp;CE) discovered in a field in Staffordshire, England, on 5 July 2009 contains numerous examples of very fine filigree described by archaeologist Kevin Leahy as "incredible".

[[Ireland|Irish]] filigree work of the [[Insular art|Insular period]] is more thoughtful in design and more extremely varied in pattern. The [[Royal Irish Academy]] in [[Dublin]] contains a number of reliquaries and personal jewels, of which filigree is the general and most remarkable ornament. The [[Tara brooch]] has been copied and imitated, and the shape and decoration of it are well known. Instead of fine curls or volutes of gold thread, the Irish filigree is varied by numerous designs by which one thread can be traced through curious knots and complications, which, disposed over large surfaces, balance one another, but always with special varieties and arrangements difficult to trace with the eye. The long thread appears and disappears without breach of continuity, the two ends generally worked into the head and the tail of a serpent or a monster.

The reliquary containing the "Bell of [[Saint Patrick]]" is covered with knotted work in many varieties. A two-handled chalice, called the "[[Ardagh Chalice]]" found near [[Limerick]] in 1868, is ornamented with work of this kind of extraordinary fineness. Twelve plaques on a band round the body of the vase, plaques on each handle and round the foot of the vase have a series of different designs of characteristic patterns, in fine filigree wire work wrought on the front of the [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]] ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Earl of Dunraven|title=On an Ancient Chalice and Brooches Lately Found at Ardagh, in the County of Limerick|journal=The Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy|year=1873|volume=24 (Antiquities)|pages=433–455|jstor=30079267|publisher=Royal Irish Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the medieval jewel work all over Europe down to the 15th&amp;nbsp;century, on reliquaries, crosses, [[crozier]]s, and other ecclesiastical goldsmiths' work, is set off with bosses and borders of filigree. Filigree work in silver was practised by the [[Moors]] of [[Spain]] during the Middle Ages with great skill, and was introduced by them and established all over the Iberian Peninsula, hence it was carried to the Spanish colonies in America.

The manufacture spread over the [[Balearic Islands]], and among the populations that border the [[Mediterranean]]. It is still made all over [[Italy]], and in [[Portugal]], [[Malta]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Albania]], the [[Ionian Islands]] and many other parts of [[Greece]]. That of the Greeks is sometimes on a large scale, with several thicknesses of wires alternating with larger and smaller bosses and beads, sometimes set with [[turquoise]]s, and mounted on convex plates, making rich ornamental headpieces, belts, and breast ornaments. Filigree silver buttons of wire-work and small bosses are worn by the peasants in most of the countries that produce this kind of jewelry.

Silver filigree brooches and buttons are also made in [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]. Little chains and pendants are added to much of this northern work.

=== Iberian Peninsula ===
The oldest filigree pieces discovered in the Iberian Peninsula date back to 2000 - 2500 BC, but its origin is not clear&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.filigranaportuguesa.pt/pages/filigrana|title=A Filigrana|last=FiligranaPortuguesa|work=FiligranaPortuguesa|access-date=2018-03-12|language=pt-PT}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These pieces possibly belonged to merchants and navigators originally from the [[Middle East]] and are not thought to have been produced in the region at that time. In the 8th century, filigree began being produced in Portugal. It happened with the arrival of the Arab population, who also brought new patterns. With time, the peninsula began to produce different filigree patterns, but while in Spain the filigree jewelry-making tradition became less relevant, in Portugal it was perfected. After the 18th century, the [[Portuguese Filigree]] already had its own distinctive imaginary, motives and shapes. Filigree works of the 17th and 18th&amp;nbsp;centuries became famous for their extraordinary complexity.&lt;ref&gt;examples in the Victoria and Albert Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Gold and silver filigree jewelry of delicate and artistic design is still made in considerable quantities throughout the country, particularly filigree hearts are iconic of Portuguese jewelry-making.

Some very curious filigree work was brought to Great Britain from [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] after the [[Battle of Magdala]]: armguards, slippers, and cups, some of which are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. They are made of thin plates of silver, over which the wirework is soldered. The filigree is subdivided by narrow borders of simple pattern, and the intervening spaces are made up of many patterns, some with grains set at intervals.

==Methods of fabrication and uses==

The art may be said to consist in curling, twisting and plaiting fine pliable threads of metal, and uniting them at their points of contact with each other, and with the ground, by means of [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] such as [[borax]], by the help of the [[blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]]. When granulated motifs are desired,  small beads are made traditionally by using precious metal wire or fine sheet to start with, which is cut up in small pieces mixed with [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] and placed in the small holes of a pitted block of charcoal (or any other suitable refractory material) and are then melted with a blowpipe (or today with a [[blowtorch]]), after which the bits of wire curl up and take a natural spherical like shape to end up in minuscule grains which slightly differ one from the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maryon|first=Herbert|author-link=Herbert Maryon|title=Metalwork and Enameling|year=1971|publisher=Dover Press|pages=53–55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AOP_RiQE6-AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=fr#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=5|chapter=Filigree}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Higgins|first=Reynold Alleyne|title=Greek and Roman Jewellery|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520036017|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Greek_and_Roman_Jewellery.html?id=vDTduIW0fgEC|edition=2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small grains or beads of the same metals are often set in the eyes of volutes, on the junctions, or at intervals at which they will set off the wirework effectively. The more delicate work is generally protected by framework of stouter wire.

[[Brooch]]es, crosses, [[earring]]s, [[buttons]]&lt;ref&gt;*[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O140427/elements-of-a/ Elements of a German filigree button, made c.&amp;nbsp;1880] image from Victoria &amp; Albert Museum [[Victoria and Albert Museum#Jewellery|jewellery collection]]&lt;/ref&gt; and other personal ornaments of modern filigree are generally surrounded and subdivided by bands of square or flat metal, giving consistency to the filling up, which would not otherwise keep its proper shape.

Filigree jewelry design, and its twisting and soldering techniques, have an application in other metal-work such as wrought iron hanging wall brackets and silertoned doors.

==Granulated work==
A few words must be added as to the [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulated work]]. Such decoration consists of minute beads, globules of gold, soldered to form patterns on a metal surface. Granulation was employed by [[Mesopotamian]] craftsmen. [[Sumer|Sumerians]] are thought to be the first to practice this technique of metalwork. Its use is rare in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Morgan|first=J.|title=Fouilles à Dahchour en 1894-1895|year=1903|publisher=Adolphe Holzhausen|location=Vienna, Austria|author2=J. Legrain |author3=G. Jéquier }}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs in Cyprus at an early period, as for instance on a gold pendant in the British Museum from [[Enkomi]] in Cyprus (10th century&amp;nbsp;BC). The pendant is in the form of a pomegranate, and has upon it a pattern of triangles, formed by more than 3,000 minute globules separately soldered on. It also occurs on ornaments of the 7th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC from [[Camirus]] in [[Rhodes]]. But these globules are large, compared with those found on [[Etruscan jewelry]]. [[Fortunato Pio Castellani]], who had made the antique jewelry of the Etruscans and Greeks his special study, with the intention of reproducing the ancient models, found it for a long time impossible to revive this particular process of delicate soldering. He overcame the difficulty at last, by the discovery of a traditional school of craftsmen at [[Sant'Angelo in Vado]], by whose help his well-known reproductions were completed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13267">The '''International Association of Applied Linguistics''' ({{lang-fr|Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquée}}), or '''AILA''', was formed in 1964 as an association of various national organizations for [[applied linguistics]]. AILA has more than 8,000 members in more than 35 different applied linguistics associations around the world.&lt;ref name="Ayoun2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dalila Ayoun|title=French Applied Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkGhsJczLaAC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=3 February 2013|year=2007|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=978-90-272-1972-5|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; AILA continues to grow, working with existing and emerging regional networks, such as AILA East Asia, AILA Europe, AILA Arabia, and AILA Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perrin |first1=Daniel |title=AILA President message |url=https://aila.info/about/messages/ |website=aila.info |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most high-profile activity is the World Congress of Applied Linguistics, which takes place once every three years. It also has two publications, ''AILA News'', a newsletter, and the ''AILA Review'', an academic journal.

== History ==
AILA was founded in 1964 at an international colloquium at the [[University of Nancy]], [[France]]. Its founding had been preceded by two years of preparation,&lt;ref name="Byram2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michaël Byram|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PirCWxMpAHkC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=4 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-12085-2|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which two central figures were the French linguists [[Antoine Culioli]] and Guy Capelle.&lt;ref name="Ayoun2007" /&gt; As part of this preparation, the association had published the first issue of its official journal, the ''International Review of Applied Linguistics'', in 1963.&lt;ref name="Berns2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berns|first=Margie|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUMqGSbeEXAC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=3 February 2013|date=20 March 2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-08-096503-1|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1969, the association had gained affiliate organizations in the form of national associations, centers for applied linguistics, and applied linguistics working groups, in a total of 18 different countries. In this year, the association held its second meeting, this time sponsored by the [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]].&lt;ref name="Berns2010" /&gt;

== Activities ==
'''World Congress of Applied Linguistics'''
AILA’s most high-profile activity is the World Congress of Applied Linguistics, an international conference hosted by one of the affiliate national associations every three years. The one exception to the three-year pattern was the first World Congress in Nancy, France, as there was a five-year gap between that and the second World Congress in Cambridge, England.&lt;ref name="Spolsky1999"/&gt;

The list of world congresses is as follows:&lt;ref name="AILA conferences"&gt;{{cite web|title=AILA World Congress 2008|url=https://aila.info/events/past-aila-world-congresses/|publisher=International Association of Applied Linguistics|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
AILA has two main publications, ''AILA News'' and the ''AILA Review''.&lt;ref name="Spolsky1999"/&gt; ''AILA News'' is a newsletter, published three times a year, and the ''AILA Review'' is a journal, published once a year and edited by guest editors.&lt;ref name="Byram2000" /&gt; Each edition of the ''AILA Review'' either contains collections of papers on a particular topic, or a collection of papers from one of the World Congresses. In addition to these two publications, AILA also works with the [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]], the [[American Association for Applied Linguistics]], and [[Oxford University Press]] to publish the journal ''[[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]]''.&lt;ref name="Spolsky1999"/&gt;

== Governance ==
Decisions in the association are made by the executive board and the international committee. The executive board makes recommendations to the international committee, on which all the national affiliated associations of applied linguistics can vote. These votes take place once a year, at different sites around the world.&lt;ref name="Spolsky1999"/&gt;

The executive board has eleven posts, seven of which are fixed roles. These are the president, a past president, the treasurer, the secretary general, the research networks coordinator and the publications coordinator. The remaining four posts do not have a fixed role, and their holders are known as ''members at large''. Members of the board cover their own expenses.&lt;ref name="AILAOrganization"&gt;{{cite web|title=Organization|url=http://www.aila.info/about/organization.html|publisher=International Association of Applied Linguistics|accessdate=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joxantonio Ormazabal (Maider Zapirain).jpg|thumb|Joxantonio Ormazabal]]
'''Joxantonio Ormazabal Berasategi''' (July 21, 1948 – May 2, 2010), also known as '''José Antonio Ormazabal Berasategi''' or '''Joxan''', was a Spanish author best known for his work in [[children's literature]]. Writing primarily in the Northern Spanish [[Basque language]], Ormazabal also worked as a [[translator]] and literary editor.

== Biography ==
Ormazabal was born in [[Zegama]], a town in Northern [[Spain]], in 1949. At the age of 12, he joined a [[seminary]] of Saturrarán and later studied in [[San Sebastian]]. In an interview with ''[[Argia (magazine)|Argia magazine]]'' on September 27, 2009, he said about his childhood: "I do not remember reading a children's story. It is true that my mother told me stories; I remember the characters of Peru and María, but I did not grow up among books." 

He left the seminary when he was 17 years old and began to teach the subject of Mathematics. When he turned 23, he became a teacher at the private school, or [[Ikastola]], Salvatore Mitxelena de Zarauz. During that time, Salbatore Mitxelena Ikastolan worked with Anjel Lertxundi, Mariasun Landa, and Juan Martin Elexpuru, among others, and used the Saioka method books.{{what?|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aunamendi.eusko-ikaskuntza.eus/artikuluak/artikulua.php?id=eu&amp;ar=102615|title=Ormazabal Berasategi, Joxean|last=|first=|date=|website=wikinetworth.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ormazabal tried to provide answers to the questions and needs of the students by writing his first children's stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aunamendi.eusko-ikaskuntza.eus/artikuluak/artikulua.php?id=eu&amp;ar=102615|title=Ormazabal Berasategi, Joxean - Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia|website=Aunamendi.eusko-ikaskuntza.eus}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I discovered the world of Ikastola in Zarauz. I found out that children really like listening to stories, they're fascinated by any story. Then I started doing tests by writing stories, reproducing and distributing them for reading the next day...". He also wrote words of well-known songs at the time with [http://aunamendi.eusko-ikaskuntza.eus/eu/artikulua/ar-136312/ Imanol Urbia], such as the ''Astoa'', the ''Fair'', the ''Tximeleta mountain'', etc. Later on, he worked as a teacher at Alkartasuna High School in [[Beasain]].

In 1981, Ormazabal began working as an editor at the Elkar publishing house where he published his first piece of work, ''Fernando Smezketarra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n99008799/|title=Toni und die Mondspinne : Eine Geschichte /|website=Worldcat.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in children's literature, editing and occasionally adapting important works through translation. Ormazabal also wrote humorous stories, poems, [[Word game|word games]] and [[Tongue-twister|tongue twisters]] until he retired in 2009 at the age of 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basqueliterature.com/Katalogoak/egileak/ormazabal|title=ORMAZABAL, Joxantonio.

The '''Kharia language''' (autonym: '''kʰaɽija''' or '''kʰeɽija'''&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, John. 2008. "Kharia". In Anderson, Gregory D.S (ed). ''The Munda languages'', 434-507. Routledge Language Family Series 3.New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-32890-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Munda languages|Munda language]] that is primarily spoken by the [[adivasi|indigenous]] [[Kharia people]] of eastern [[India]].

==Classification==
Kharia belongs to the Kharia–Juang branch of the [[Munda languages|Munda language family]]. Its closest extant relative is the [[Juang language]], but the relationship between Kharia and Juang is remote.

The most widely cited classification places Kharia and Juang together as a subgroup of the South Munda branch of the Munda family. However, some earlier classification schemes placed Kharia and Juang together, as an independent branch deriving from the root of the Munda languages, which they named Central Munda.

Kharia is in contact with [[Sadri language|Sadri]] (the local lingua franca), [[Mundari language|Mundari]], [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]], [[Hindi]], and [[Odia language|Odia]] (in Odisha) (Peterson 2008:434).

==Distribution==
Kharia speakers are located in the following [[districts of India]] (Peterson 2008:434).

*[[Jharkhand]]
**[[Simdega district]]
**[[Gumla district]]
*[[Chhattisgarh]]
**[[Surguja district]]
**[[Raigarh district]]
*[[Odisha]]
**[[Sundargarh district]]

'''Linguistic Knowledge Builder''' (LKB) is a [[free software|free]] and [[Open-source software|open source]] [[grammar engineering environment]] for creating [[grammar]]s and lexicons of [[Natural language processing|natural language]]s. Any [[Unification (computer science)|unification]]-based grammar can be implemented, but LKB is typically used for grammars with typed [[feature structure]]s such as [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar|HPSG]].

It is implemented in [[Common Lisp]], and constitutes one core component of the [[DELPH-IN]] collaboration.

}}

'''Low Prussian''' ({{lang-de|Niederpreußisch}}), sometimes known simply as '''Prussian''' (''Preußisch''), is a moribund [[dialect]] of [[East Low German]] that developed in [[East Prussia]]. Low Prussian was spoken in [[East Prussia|East]] and [[West Prussia]] and [[Danzig]] up to 1945. It developed on a [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] [[Substratum|substrate]] through the influx of [[Dutch language|Dutch]]- and [[Low German|Low-German]]-speaking immigrants. It overruled [[Old Prussian]], which then became extinct in the 17th century.

[[Plautdietsch]], a [[Low German]] variety, is included within Low Prussian by some observers. Excluding Plautdietsch, Low Prussian can be considered [[Language death|moribund]] due to the [[evacuation of East Prussia|evacuation]] and [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forced expulsion]] of Germans from East Prussia after [[World War II]]. Plautdietsch, however, has several thousand speakers throughout the world, most notably in [[South America]], [[Canada]] and [[Germany]].

[[Simon Dach]]'s poem ''[[Anke van Tharaw]]'', the best known East Prussian poem{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}, was written in Low Prussian.

== Vocabulary ==
According to [http://www.iserv.net/~bsman/new_page_2.htm one summary of Low German dialects], words very characteristic of Low Prussian are ''doa'' ('dor', there), ''joa'' ('jo', yes), ''goah'' ('goh', go) and ''noa'' ('nober', neighbor), which feature the diphthong "oa" instead of the usual "o" or "a".  The dialect is also marked by a substitution of "k" for "ch", such as in ''mannke'' ('minsch', person), and a loan of High German-like words, such as ''zwei'' ('twee', two).  Words are often shortened, in a manner similar to that of the neighboring East Pomeranian dialect, giving ''beet'' (beten, little bit) and ''baakove'' ('bakåben', bake oven)&lt;!--[http://www.iserv.net/~bsman/new_page_2.htm]--&gt;.

Some observers argue that it resembles [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Flemish language|Flemish]] because of these features&lt;!-- (as do other words, like ''dood'' (dead)--&gt;. Low Prussian also has a number of words in common with Plautdietsch, such as ''Klemp'' (cow), ''Klopps'' (lump, ball of earth), and ''Tsoagel'' (tail).

Some other words&lt;ref&gt;Found in Riemann, Erhard (ed.): ''Preußisches Wörterbuch'',  Vol. 1, Issue 1. Neumünster (Wachholtz) 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;  are:

* ''Boffke'' - boy, lad
* ''dätsch'' - dumb
* ''Dubs'' - bum
* ''Gnaschel'' - little child
* ''jankere'' - yearn
* ''Kobbel'' - mare
* ''Pungel'' - pouch
* ''schabbere'' - talk
* ''Schischke'' - pine-cone
* ''Schucke'' - potato(es)

== Varieties ==
* ''Übergangsmundart zum Ostpommerschen'', transitional dialect with [[East Pomeranian]]
* ''[[Mundart des Weichselmündungsgebietes]]'', around [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]]
* ''Mundart der Frischen Nehrung und der Danziger Nehrung'', around the [[Vistula Lagoon]]

== Low Prussian and Lithuanian ==
In addition to the words of Old Prussian origin, another source of [[Balticism]]s was Lithuanian. After the migration of Lithuanians in the 15th century, many Lithuanian loanwords appeared in the Low Prussian dialect.

The '''Língua Geral Paulista''' (São Paulo General language), or '''Tupí Austral''' (Southern Tupi), was a  [[Tupi language|Tupi]]-based [[trade language]] of [[São Vicente, São Paulo]], and the upper [[Tietê River]]. In the 17th century, it was widely spoken in [[São Paulo]] and spread to neighboring regions. Starting in 1750, orders from [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]] forced Portuguese to be taught to Brazilian children in schools. Língua Geral Paulista subsequently lost ground to Portuguese and eventually became extinct.

'''Malak Jân Nemati''' (or Malek Jân Nemati) was born in 1906 in [[Jeyhounabad]], a village in Iranian Kurdistan. Also known as Sheikh Jâni and Saint Jani, she was a charismatic figure and a mystical writer and poet in Kurdish and Persian language. She was the daughter of [[Hajj Nematollah]] and the sister of [[Nur Ali Elahi|Ostad Elahi]]. There are few written sources about her life. Some elements can be found in the words of her brother [[Nur Ali Elahi|Ostad Elahi]]&lt;ref&gt;Nur Ali Elahi, ''Asar-ol Haqq (Words of Truth), Volume 1'', Tehran, 3rd edition (1987) and ''Volume 2'', Tehran (1991). Each volume is divided into numbered sayings. References to these volumes appear hereinafter as AH1 and AH2 followed by the number of the saying.&lt;/ref&gt; whom she was very close to. A biography in French was published on the occasion of the centennial of her birth, including the translation of some of her poems and sayings.&lt;ref&gt;Leili Anvar, ''Malek Jân Ne'mati - La vie n'est pas courte mais le temps est compté'', Diane de Selliers, Paris (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Malak Jan was born into a family belonging to the mystical order the [[Ahl-e Haqq]] (literally “Friends of the Truth”). Her father [[Hajj Nematollah]] was an outstanding spiritual personality who gave up a comfortable life a few years before she was born to devote himself to finding the Truth. So from a very early age, Malak Jan was initiated with the rest of her family to asceticism and prayer, but also and above all to ethical and spiritual reflection.

While in those days and in those remote regions of Kurdistan, new-born girls were greeted with condolences, it is noteworthy that Malak Jan received the same comprehensive education as her elder brother.&lt;ref&gt;Anvar, ''supra'' note 2, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; With Kurdish as her mother tongue, she learned Persian and Arabic and set about studying the revealed books and the extremely rich Iranian poetry from which she would later draw her inspiration when writing her own poems.&lt;ref&gt;A number of her poems have been translated from Kurdish to French in Leili Anvar's book (cited above note 2), pp. 69-103.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also given a musical education as she learned to play the [[tanbur]] (Kurdish lute accompanying Ahl-e Haqq sacred chants) and the [[setar]] (classical Persian lute). [[Hajj Nematollah]] was particularly fond of her. In keeping with his wish, she wore a white habit and bonnet “so that people could not tell whether it was a boy or a girl”.&lt;ref name=AH2-91&gt;AH2, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; She actually wore that outfit throughout her life.

When she was thirteen, she had to suffer the grief of losing her father. Shortly afterwards, she experienced a painful ocular condition and by the age of twenty, she was completely and permanently blinded.&lt;ref name="AH2-91"/&gt; The loss of her eyesight, though, seems to have coincided with the awakening of a form of mystical passion&lt;ref&gt;AH2, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; that led her to progressively draw closer to her brother [[Nur Ali Elahi|Ostad Elahi]] and she became one of his most accomplished followers. When [[Nur Ali Elahi|Ostad Elahi]] died, she quite naturally took up the torch of his spiritual teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Anvar, ''supra'' note 2, pp. 30 and 45 to 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressively, Malak Jan's personality, her meaningful spiritual reflection and constant practice of charity&lt;ref&gt;Anvar, ''supra'' note 2, pp. 51-53&lt;/ref&gt; earned her a reputation for saintliness in her deeply religious milieu. People around her wrote down what she said and the advice she gave, and a certain number of their notes have been translated into French.&lt;ref&gt;Anvar (2007), pp. 105-132&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her handicap, Malak Jan spent her whole life studying anatomy, science, history, geography, using, for instance, audiotaped courses. This passion for knowledge amounted to a spiritual as well as an intellectual approach. Malak Jan was opposed to what she called “superstitious spirit”&lt;ref&gt;See, Anvar, ''supra'' note 2, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to tackle spirituality with reflection and knowledge. She refused to blindly accept principles turned into dogmas: "In the beginning, I would say to myself: 'I have to understand by myself'. I would not believe what other people said. For instance, I had to understand by myself that there is a world beyond, that there is a God, that there are spiritual laws, that the soul is eternal… I first resolved the question of the existence of God, then I understood that there is an Account and that no being will be wronged…"&lt;ref&gt;See, Anvar, ''supra'' note 2, pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malak Jan first endeavored to progressively develop this way of dealing with spirituality among the peasants of Jeyhounabad, known in the country since then as "the village of philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;Anvar, ''supra'' note 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same spirit, she contributed to improving to living conditions of the villagers by having electricity brought or by inventing an interest-free microcredit system.&lt;ref&gt;Anvar, ''supra'' note 2, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;
Although living in a deeply patriarchal society, she used her spiritual authority to defend more specifically women's rights, by gradually teaching mothers to look after their daughters as much as their sons, by getting fathers to leave them a share of inheritance equal to that of their brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Anvar, ''supra'' note 2, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of her life, Malak Jan brought a certain number of reforms to the [[Ahl-e Haqq]] form of worship that contributed to attributing women the same level of dignity as men on the ritual plane. To Ahl-e Haqq devotees these reforms amounted to a doctrinal revolution and the most traditionalist branches of the order expressed their hostility.

Malak Jan Nemati died in 1993 in [[France]] after having open-heart surgery. She was buried in the [[Perche]] region of [[France]], in a small village called Baillou. A stone and glass shrine has been erected on her grave in her memory: the Saint Jani Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.multibeton.de/images/downloads/referenzen/Multibeton_2000%20Mausoleum%20St%20Janie.pdf Multibeton: Mausoleum Ste.

[[File:Mato Kosyk.png|thumb|Mato Kosyk (1852–1940)]]
'''Mato Kosyk''' (June 18, 1853 – November 22, 1940) was a [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] poet and minister. He was born in [[Werben, Brandenburg|Werben]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], emigrated from [[Lower Lusatia]] to the [[United States]], and died at his rural home near [[Albion, Oklahoma]].

== Youth ==
Kosyk began his schooling at the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Cottbus]] in 1867, with the intention of studying theology. He left the gymnasium before graduation in 1873, bringing his study ambitions to a temporary end. Instead, he started working for a [[Leipzig]] railroad company, where he wrote his first lyrical texts. These were all written in [[Lower Sorbian]].

===Literary activities===
Because of problems with his health, Kosyk returned to Werben in 1877. During the following years he made a living as a freelance writer and produced his most important poetic works. From 1880 onwards he was co-editor of the ''Bramborske nowiny'' ([[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] News). Through his involvement in the revision of the Lower Sorbian church hymnal he made a lasting impact on the Lower Sorbian language.

Kosyk maintained contacts with practically all important representatives of Sorbian cultural life: [[Kito Šwjela]], [[Hajndrich Jordan]], [[Bjarnat Krušwica]], [[Juro Surowin]] and [[Alfons Parczewski]], as well as [[Michał Hórnik]] and [[Jan Arnošt Smoler]]. Kosyk was one of the founders of the Lower Sorbian Maśica Serbska, the most important organisation of Lower Sorbian culture.

==Emigration==
In October 1883, Kosyk left for [[Hamburg]], from where he sailed to [[New York City]]. He travelled by way of [[Buffalo, New York]], to [[Springfield, Illinois]]. Here he could fulfill his dreams to study theology, and he enrolled in an orthodox Lutheran theological seminary. In January 1884 however, he transferred to a German seminary in [[Chicago, Illinois]], instead, and continued his studies in a liberal Lutheran direction. Moreover, the students there spoke German instead of English, making it much easier for Mato Kosyk to understand. He completed his studies in 1885 and was ordained in [[Wellsburg, Iowa]], where he worked among German [[Frisia]]n immigrants. Although Kosyk worked in the United States among [[German language|German]]- and [[Frisian languages|Frisian]]-speaking farmers, he never ceased to write his Sorbian tales and poems during this period. He continued to publish in Sorbian publications.

===Temporary return===
At the end of 1886 Mato returned to Lower Lusatia when his brother Kito died. It appears his return was made easier because of tensions between the congregation in Wellsburg and himself. After returning, Kosyk endeavoured to have his ordination recognized; he very much wanted to fill a vacancy in [[Drachhausen]] near [[Peitz]]. His efforts were in vain, however, and he travelled back to the United States in 1887.

==America==
In 1887 Kosyk again travelled to the United States, and he would never again return to Europe. He found work as pastor in [[Nebraska]], where until 1907 he worked in several German-language congregations: [[Ridgeley, Nebraska|Ridgeley]] in [[Dodge County, Nebraska|Dodge County]] (1887–1889), [[Princeton, Nebraska|Princeton]] in [[Lancaster County, Nebraska|Lancaster County]] (1889–1895), [[Stamford, Nebraska|Stamford]] in [[Harlan County, Nebraska|Harlan County]] (1896–1899) and [[Ohiowa, Nebraska|Ohiowa]] in [[Fillmore County, Nebraska|Fillmore County]] (1899–1907). From autumn 1895 until summer 1896 he was out of work and lived in [[Roca, Nebraska|Roca]] in [[Lancaster County, Nebraska|Lancaster County]]. Kosyk married Anna Wher in Princeton in 1890. Anne came from Duzno (formally Hochsburg, now part of [[Trzemeszno]]), a village in [[Kreis Gnesen]] in the [[Province of Posen]]. Kosyk's last position was in [[El Reno, Oklahoma]]. He retired in 1913 and moved near [[Albion, Oklahoma]] where in 2010, the home he lived in still stood.

Only in 1892 did Kosyk pick up poetry and writing again. He also renewed his neglected contacts with Sorbian intellectuals. [[Bogumił Šwjela]] wanted to publish an anthology of Kosyk poems, which appeared in 1893. Kosyk would continue to have poems published in the Lausitz until 1898.

After the deaths of Kosyk's only son, Juro, (at age 24 after a horse-riding accident) in 1915 and his wife Anna in 1929, Kosyk became increasingly isolated. He eventually married his housekeeper Wilma Filter in 1938. Wilma left Albion a year after Kosyk's death taking his papers with him; these have been deemed lost. During this last period, Kosyk maintained intensive contacts with the young Sorbian writer [[Mina Witkojc]].

==Heritage==
[[File:Wjerbno Mato Kosyk.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial in Werben/Wjerbno]]
Mato Kosyk's work is predominantly lyrical, and includes very little prose. His poems are concentrated around the Christian faith, which Kosyk generally connected to nature in general and Lusatia in particular. The latter is the equivalent of the homeland, of the ''Heimat'', and is contrasted with the foreign. Kosyk identifies this through the Sorbian language, which on the one hand combines beauty and vulnerability and on the other hand has to battle against imminent extinction.

Kosyk used both classical form as well as rhyming forms taken from folk culture for his poems. His preference was for the [[hexameter]] form. For example, his ''Serbska swajźba w Błotach'' ("The Sorbian Wedding in the Spreewald") consists of nearly 2,000 hexameters. Hexameters are also used in ''Ten kśicowany'' ("The Crucified") and ''Helestupjenje Jezusa Kristusa'' ("The Descent of Jesus Christ to Hell").

The home&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/25600678%40N08/3354733435&lt;/ref&gt; were Kosyk lived from 1913 to 1940, situated near [[Albion, Oklahoma]], [[Pushmataha County]], called the [[Mato Kosyk House]], has been added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  Its justification for inclusion is that it is the sole surviving structure associated with Kosyk. As in Kosyk's time, it features beautiful views of the [[Kiamichi Mountains]].

The primary school in [[Briesen (Spreewald)|Briesen]] has been named after Kosyk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2750">'''Mícheál''' or '''Micheál Mac Suibhne''' (c. 1760–1820) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]].

Mac Suibhne was born near [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]], then part of [[County Galway]] and now in [[County Mayo]]. He spent most of his life in [[Connemara]]. He is most associated with [[Cleggan]], [[County Galway]], and also spent parts of his life in [[Moycullen]] and south of [[Clifden]]. All of his poems were composed and written in Irish, his native language.

In 1846, [[James Hardiman]] wrote of him: "In this district (Doon, [[Omey Island]], [[Clifden]]) there lately lived a neglected poetical [[genius]], whose name was Michael Mac Sweeney, who, though held in high repute by his countrymen, was suffered to die in poverty; but this, it is said, often occurs in half-civilized communities, where pride and ignorance are generally prevalent. By the English-speaking portion of the people, Mac Sweeney was the 'Bard of the West.' He composed, in his native language, several poems and songs of considerable merit; which have become such favourites, that there are few who cannot repeat some of them from memory. Many of these have been collected by the Editor; and if space shall permit, one or more of the most popular will be inserted in the Additional Notes, as a specimen of modern Irish versification, and of those compositions which afford so much social pleasure to the good people of Iar-Connacht."

In the Additional Notes to ''Iar or West Connacht'' (1846),&lt;ref&gt;''West or Iar-Connacht'',   p.&amp;nbsp;112-113, pp.&amp;nbsp;283–293, [[Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh]] 1684; ed. [[James Hardiman]], 1846.&lt;/ref&gt; Hardiman included the full version of ''Abnan an Phuca'', the ''Connemara Wedding'' and ''Eoghain Coir'' by Mac Suibhne. Professor [[Tomas Ó Maille]] compiled and edited Mac Suibhne's poems in 1934.

===Relatives===
His brother, Toirealfhach, was also a poet but none of his compositions survive. Toirealfhach had a son, Johnnie Terry Mac Suibhne, who resided at Newtown, Cleggan. Johnnie's son, Séamus Mac Suibhne, wrote songs in English, including ''The Bogs of Léana Mór''.

'''Mir Mosharraf Hossain''' ({{lang-bn|মীর মশাররফ হোসেন}}; 1847–1911) was a [[Bengalis|Bengali]] writer, novelist, playwright and essayist. He is considered to be the first major writer to emerge from the Muslim society of Bengal, and one of the finest prose writers in the Bengali language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hajar Bacharer Bangali Sangskriti|last=Murshid|first=Golam|publisher=Abasar|year=2016|isbn=984 415 190 2|location=Dhaka|pages=308|language=bn|script-title=হাজার বছরের বাঙালি সংস্কৃতি|trans-title=Bengali Culture across the Millennia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bangla Sahitye Musalman|last=Syed|first=Abdul Mannan|publisher=[[Islamic Foundation Bangladesh|Islamic Foundation]]|year=2009|isbn=984 06 0478 3|location=Dhaka|pages=20|language=bn|script-title=বাংলা সাহিত্যে মুসলমান|trans-title=Muslims in Bengali Literature|author-link=Abdul Mannan Syed}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magnum opus ''[[Bishad Shindhu|Bishad Sindhu]]'' (Ocean of Sorrow) is a popular classic among the Bengali readership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bisad-Sindhu|title=Bisad-Sindhu - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mir Mosharraf Hossain was born in the village of Lahinipara in [[Kumarkhali Upazila|Kumarkhali]] under [[Kushtia District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mir Mosharraf Hossain: A pioneering Bengali writer |url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=171824:mir-mosharraf-hossain-a-pioneering-bengali-writer&amp;catid=123:art-culture&amp;Itemid=217 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224023749/http://www.theindependentbd.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=171824%3Amir-mosharraf-hossain-a-pioneering-bengali-writer&amp;catid=123%3Aart-culture&amp;Itemid=217 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=18 February 2014 |newspaper=The Independent |date=1 June 2013 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  But most of the time of his life spent in Padamdi in Baliakandi PS under district Rajbari. His widely accepted date of birth is 13 November 1847.&lt;ref&gt;ব্রজেন্দ্রনাথ বন্দোপাধ্যায়: 'স্বর্ণকুমারী দেবী, মীর মশাররফ হোসেন'। সাহিত্য সাধক-চরিতমালা' : ২৮-২৯ সংখ্যক পুস্তিকা। পঞ্চম-সং: কলিকাতা, জৈষ্ঠ্য ১৩৬১. পৃষ্ঠা ৩১।&lt;/ref&gt; But some researchers also claim his date of birth is 26 October 1847.&lt;ref&gt;আবুল আহসান চৌধুরী. মীর মশাররফ হোসেন. জীবনী গ্রন্থমালা সিরিজ. বাংলা একাডেমী. ঢাকা. ১৯৯৩. পৃষ্ঠা-১১।&lt;/ref&gt; He was born to  Mir Moazzem Hossain, a Muslim aristocrat, and Daulatunnesa.

Mosharraf Hossain learned Arabic and Persian with a teacher at home and then Bengali at a pathshala. He began his formal education at Kushtia School and then studied up to Class V at Krishnanagar Collegiate School. He was admitted to Kalighat School in Kolkata but could not complete his studies. Mosharraf Hossain began his career looking after his father’s landed property. Later he served the Faridpur Nawab Estate and, in 1885, the Delduar Estate. He lived in Kolkata from 1903 to 1909.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh|last=Guha|first=Bimal|publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]|year=2012|isbn=|editor1-last=Islam|editor1-first=Sirajul|editor1-link=Sirajul Islam|edition=2nd|location=|pages=|chapter=Hossain, Mir Mosharraf|editor2-last=Jamal|editor2-first=Ahmed A.|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Hossain,_Mir_Mosharraf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While still a student, Mosharraf Hossain worked as a ''mofussil'' reporter for the ''Sangbad Prabhakar'' (1831) and ''[[Gram Barta Prokashika]]'' (1863). His literary career started here.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia/&gt;

=== Literary career ===
Mir Mosarraf Hossain's magnum opus is ''Bishad Shindhu'', depicting the tale of martyrdom of [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]]  in [[Karbala]]. He was one of the first Muslim writers to emerge from colonial British India. His other works include ''Jamidar Darpan'' (Reflections on Zamindars, a play on the plight of common people under the [[Zamindar]]s (landlords installed by the British colonial rulers) and their struggle against them.

His literary works were included in the curriculum of school level, secondary, higher secondary and graduation level [[Bengali Literature]] in Bangladesh.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Mir Mosharraf Hossain wrote his 'Jamidar Darpan' about the background of the peasant uprising against the landlords in Sirajganj 1872-73.  He had always showed an active interest in the everyday life of his fellow countrymen.

== Personal life ==
In 1865 he married Aziz-un-Nesa. His second wife was Bibi Kulsum married in 1874. He died on 19 December 1911.&lt;ref name="dailystar"&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-114610 Homage to Mir Mosharraf Hossain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mir Mosharraf Hussain|last=Ahmed|first=Khandakar Shamim|publisher=Kathaprokash|year=2018|isbn=984 70120 00321 3|location=Dhaka|pages=73|language=Bengali|script-title=মীর মশাররফ হোসেন|orig-year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nawayath]]s speaks a dialect called ‘Nawayathi’. It is an amalgam of [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Hindi]], with [[Konkani language|Konkani]] as its base. The Navayath language uses Persian script for writing.  "Persian script" was being used to write by the Nawaytis long before the language Urdu came into existence.

[[File:Novgorod Codex - colour.jpg|thumb|right|1st Page of the Codex at the time of Discovery]]
The '''Novgorod Codex''' ({{lang-ru|Новгородский кодекс}}) is the oldest book of the [[Rus' people|Rus’]], unearthed on July 13, 2000 in [[Novgorod]]. It is a [[palimpsest]] consisting of three bound wooden tablets containing four pages filled with wax, on which its former owner wrote down dozens, probably hundreds of texts during two or three decades, each time wiping out the preceding text.

According to the data obtained by [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphy]] (and [[dendrochronology]]), [[radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]] and from the text itself (where the year 999 occurs several times), the wax codex was used in the first quarter of the 11th century and maybe even in the last years of the 10th century. It is therefore older than the [[Ostromir Gospels]], the earliest precisely dated East Slavic book.

== Discovery and description ==
[[Image:Novgorod Velikaya Ulitza.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An example of excavated Novgorod boardwalk, built ca. 1120]]
Since 1932 the ancient Russian city of Novgorod has been continuously excavated by the Novgorod Archaeological Expedition started by [[Artemiy Artsikhovsky]]. Since the early 1970s the excavations focused on the Troitza ([[Trinity]]) area of the ancient Ludin part of town, covering nearly 6,000 square meters (64,500 square feet). The area excavated housed affluent mansions and a large 1,200 square meter (13,000 sq ft) communal building housed a court house and a Novgorod city treasury. The vast majority of text found in Novgorod were [[birch bark manuscript]]s; wax tablets were extremely uncommon.&lt;ref name="butrin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2769294|title=Град, в котором читают книги|last=Butrin|first=Dmitry|date=19 July 2015|publisher=[[Kommersant]]|language=Russian|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2000, the expedition headed by prof. [[Valentin Yanin]] discovered three wooden [[wax tablet]]s in the soil. The tablets were 19 x 15 x 1&amp;nbsp;cm, and they have a 15 x 11.5&amp;nbsp;cm indentation filled with wax. Two of the tablets have one wax layer and one blank wooden side, and a third tablet has two wax sides. The boards have round holes at one edge, through which wooden pegs were inserted, holding the tablets together as a four-page book.&lt;ref name="butrin"/&gt;

The tablets were discovered in a stratum 50&amp;nbsp;cm away and 30&amp;nbsp;cm below a wooden walkway [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronologically]] dated to the year 1036. As the strata in [[Novgorod]] are estimated to have grown at about 1&amp;nbsp;cm per year, the document was estimated to have been placed there around 1015-1020. Subsequent [[radiocarbon dating]] of the wax at the [[Uppsala University]] in [[Sweden]] gave the range of 760 AD to 1030 AD with a 95.4% certainty. Due to the Christian text on the tablets, dates earlier than the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] in 988 are considered unlikely, and as such, the wax tablets are reliably dated to a very narrow 42-year window between 988 and 1030 AD.

== Basic text ==

The wax of the codex itself contains [[psalms]] [[Psalm 75|75]] and [[Psalm 76|76]] (and a small fragment of [[psalm 67]]). This is the so-called basic text of the Novgorod Codex. Consequently, the book is alternatively known as the ''Novgorod Psalter''. This text can be read as easily as any other document on [[parchment]] and could be examined at once. The Psalter translation exhibits a somewhat different translatory tradition than the Slavonic translations of the Psalter known so far (especially the [[Psalterium Sinaiticum]]).

== Language ==

The language of the Novgorod Codex is a very regular (especially in the basic text) [[Old Church Slavonic|Church Slavonic]], albeit with some 'mistakes' in the rendition of the [[yus]] letters betraying the author's [[Old East Slavic language|East Slavic]] origin. The whole text was written by the same hand in a so-called 'monoyeric' orthography (Russian ''одноеровая система письма''), i.e. instead of the two [[yer]] letters ''ь'' and ''ъ'' only ''ъ'' is used; before the codex discovery, the monoyeric system was considered to have been a late invention, with the dualyeric system being the original; the discovery proved that the reverse was the case.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}&lt;!--This conclusion is not self-evident. The earliest preserved text is not the same as the earliest text that ever existed and hence does not necessarily have the earliest orthography that ever existed.--&gt;

==Preservation and reading method==
[[Conservation-restoration|Preservation]] of the tablets presented unique challenges, as the usual preservation method for wood would have destroyed the wax layer, and vice versa. The method eventually decided on called for careful separation of the wax layer, and preserving each material separately. The newly exposed wood under the removed wax was found to have been extensively scratched by the [[stylus]] cutting through the thin wax. It took the research team several weeks to realize that some symbols could be discerned in the scratches.

Russian linguist [[Andrey Zaliznyak]], one of the foremost experts on the early [[Old Novgorod dialect|medieval Novgorod dialect]], has taken tremendous effort to reconstruct so far only a small portion of the texts preceding the basic text. The main difficulty with this task is the fact that the feeble traces of dozens of thousands of letters left by the [[stylus]], often hardly discernible from the natural shading of the soft lime wood, have been superimposed on each other, producing an impenetrable labyrinth of lines (Zaliznyak speaks of a “hyper-[[palimpsest]]”). Consequently, ‘reading’ a single concealed text of one page can take weeks.

[[Image:Zalizniak2.JPG|thumb|right|Andrey Zaliznyak]]
According to Zaliznyak, reading the concealed texts in the scratches is a unique challenge unlike anything attempted by any research team previously. The very compact surface of the four writing surfaces contains traces of thousands of texts, estimated to have been written over several decades. As such, the stylus traces form a constant mesh of lines across the entire surface. To complicate the process, they are also all written by a single hand, making handwriting analysis impossible. As such, Zaliznyak does not call the process 'reading'; instead, he calls it 'reconstruction'. Instead of asking himself the question, 'what's written on this line', Zaliznyak approaches the problem as 'is a phrase A or a word B possible among everything written in this sector'.

The reconstruction is therefore done letter by letter, starting from an arbitrary position, usually somewhere at the top of a 'page'. After analyzing a meshwork of scratches and identifying some of the letters in a given spot (which can realistically number hundreds or even thousands), Zaliznyak then moves some distance to the side and begins identifying symbols at the next position. After several positions are discerned in that way, most letter combinations are discarded as senseless jumble, and possibly meaningful words are identified. Zaliznyak then moves to the next position and attempts to locate subsequent symbols that would complete the word or a sentence. As the text, in a typical fashion for the writing of the time, is written with no spaces between words, identifying these chains becomes somewhat easier compared to if it had been written with spaces.

After careful examination of each position, Zaliznyak creates symbol chains that continue to grow in size. The search often branches off into false leads, where at a certain symbol the chains switch off to a different text fragment. Sometimes these false branches are identified after only a few symbols, but sometimes the false branches can take several words, sentences, and even longer to be discounted. Such false leads can take several days or even weeks to identify.

Another specific of the texts is that many of them have been written multiple times, for reasons that can only be guessed at. Due to the previous copy being erased before a new copy is made, each repetition is written somewhat shifted compared to the previous copy. It is unknown whether the copies were made right after each other, or weeks, months or even years apart. Multiple copies of the same text make identifying false chains easier.

The process remains exceedingly hard to [[peer-review]]. Only small portions of Zaliznyak's texts have been peer-reviewed to this time, as no research team came forward that was willing to learn and repeat the process over the length of a large text. Linguist [[Izabel Vallotton]] of [[Geneva]] cooperated with Zaliznyak on some portions of the reconstruction, where Zaliznyak identified a portion of the chain and passed it on to Vallotton, with both of them then continuing to independently reconstruct the text. In the experiment, both Vallotton and Zaliznyak ended up with completely identical chains, matching to the letter, but the chains were admittedly short, only 20-30 symbols long.

Finally, a problem Zaliznyak considers unsolvable is identifying spelling errors or Russisms in the [[Old Church Slavonic|Church Slavonic]]. Often, the position where an error or deviation from Church Slavonic is possible, a correct symbol or symbols will also be present alongside an erroneous one, in which case Zaliznyak always assumes the original text was correctly written. In some cases, such assumptions will of course be incorrect. These multiple possibilities may also be the original author's correcting himself by erasing a mistake with his stylus and writing in a correct symbol.

==Concealed texts and identity of the owner==
[[Image:Novgorod Codex.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Reconstructed first page, Ps 75]]
One of the very first concealed texts reconstructed was an unnamed text Zaliznyak called ''Instruction on Forgiveness of Sins''. Its introduction is written in first person by somebody who identifies himself as 'Alexander, the Areopagite of [[Thrace|Thracia]], of [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]]n origins (birth)'. The text contains a highly unorthodox prayer, reading 'we pray to thee father Alexander, forgive us our sins by your will and give us salvation and the food of paradise, amen'. In it, this Alexander therefore assumes powers usually reserved to God alone. The prayer is followed by prophecies by the same Alexander, who then calls for people to 'leave your villages and homes' and to walk the earth, spreading Alexander's message. Alexander then says 'whoever listens to me, listens to [[Saint Peter|Peter]]'. This is followed by a highly original call following along the lines of 'leave your villages and homes', with dozens of phrases starting with 'leave your' and listing a great number of things to leave, all starting with a Slavic prefix 'raz-': разлады, раздоры, расклады, развозы, распловы, разлогы, разлеты, размеры, размолвы, and so on (troubles, strifes, positions, moving around, sailing, flying, sizes, disagreements, etc.). This highly original sequence leads Zaliznyak to believe that the text was originally composed in Church Slavonic, as it is hard to imagine that translation from a foreign language could follow such a neat Slavic pattern.

A subsequent concealed text contains the following passage: 'The world is a town in which live the Armenians and the Africans and the Thracians and the Italians and the Spanish and the Greeks'. Zaliznyak believes that an earlier allusion to Alexander, the Areopagite of [[Thracia]] is connected to the listing of Thracians early in the list.

Finally, another text that Zaliznyak calls “Spiritual Instruction from the Father and the Mother to the Son” contains the following note “Въ лѣто ҂ѕ҃ф҃з҃ азъ мънихъ исаакии поставленъ попомъ въ соужъдали въ цръкъве свѧтаго александра арменина…” (“In 6507 [i.e. 999] I, monk Isaakiy, was posted as a priest in [[Suzdal]], at the church of St. Alexander the Armenian…”). The year 6507/999 reappears several times on the margins, and is the only numerical sequence identified in the text.

“Spiritual Instruction from the Father and the Mother to the Son” continues onto increasingly more gloomy analysis of the state of the world, showing that the writer identifies with people excluded from the official church for believing unorthodox teachings.

Zaliznyak therefore postulates that the writer was this monk Isaakiy, who followed a previously unknown schismatic teaching of a self-proclaimed prophet Alexander, an Armenian by birth, and that Alexander himself was based in Thracia, and Isaakiy was sent to spread Alexander's word in Suzdal. The 'church of St. Alexander', according to Zaliznyak, does not mean a physical church building, but rather a church in the sense of teachings or doctrine. As there were no monasteries anywhere in Rus during the time these texts were written, Zaliznyak believes that Isaakiy was taught outside of Rus, and became a monk elsewhere. He was likely a witness to the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] in 988, and operated in a still largely pagan Rus of the early 11th century. The concealed texts contain a conversion prayer, which in first person singular and plural (''I'' and ''we'') denies idolatry and accepts Christianity, so it is likely Isaakiy himself converted pagan Slavs.

The teachings of Alexander the Armenian were likely an early form of [[Bogomilism]]. The [[Nikonian Chronicle]] contains a mention of a schismatic monk Andreyan jailed for disagreeing with the official church in 1004, during the timeframe the codex texts were written. According to [[Evgeniy Golubinskiy]], this Andreyan was a Bogomil. So the Novgorod Bogomil codex being found in the vicinity of a courthouse in the early 11th century therefore leads to some theories.

Finally, a feature of the texts is common allusions to the city of [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]], without any direct references to any events there. Zaliznyak believes that Laodicea was a sort of a secret word among the Bogomils, which identified a Bogomil teaching to other believers, without making anything apparent to outsiders. In this context, the strange title of a schismatic work written 500 years later by a heretic [[Fedor Kuritzyn]], ''[[The Message of Laodicea]]'', takes on a new light.

The great number of so far unknown texts in the Novgorod Codex might be explained by the fact that the writer belonged to a Christian community declared [[heresy|heretic]]al by the ‘official’ church — probably a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] group similar to the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]]. After the ‘official’ church had prevailed, the sect’s texts were no longer copied and most traces of the existence of this heresy were erased. An especially symptomatic example of the scribe’s attitude to the ‘official’ church is the following excerpt from the “Spiritual Instruction from the Father and the Mother to the Son”:

In musical composition, the '''opus number''' is the "work number" that is assigned to a composition, or to a set of compositions, to indicate the chronological order of the [[composer]]'s production. Opus numbers are used to distinguish among compositions with similar titles; the word is abbreviated as "Op." for a single work, or "Opp." when referring to more than one work.

To indicate the specific place of a given work within a music catalogue, the opus number is paired with a cardinal number; for example, Beethoven's [[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor]] (1801) (nicknamed ''Moonlight Sonata'')  is "Opus 27, No. 2", whose work-number identifies it as a companion piece to "Opus 27, No. 1" ([[Piano Sonata No. 13 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 13 in E-flat major]], 1800–01), paired in same opus number, with both being subtitled ''Sonata quasi una Fantasia'', the only two of the kind in all of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas. Furthermore, the ''Piano Sonata, Op. 27 N° 2, in C-sharp minor'' is also catalogued as "Sonata No. 14", because it is the fourteenth [[sonata]] composed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].

Given composers' inconsistent assignment of opus numbers, especially during the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era (1600–1750) and the [[Classical music era|Classical]] era (1750–1827), musicologists have developed other catalogue-number systems; among them the ''[[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]]'' (BWV-number), and the ''[[Köchel catalogue|Köchel-Verzeichnis]]'' (K- and KV -numbers) with which are organised the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], respectively.

==Etymology==
In the [[Classical period (music)|classical period]], the Latin word ''opus'' ("work", "labour") was used to identify, list, and catalogue a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', s.v. "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dopus1 opus]".&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[15th century|15th]] and [[16th century|16th centuries]], the word ''opus'' was used by Italian composers to denote a specific musical composition, and by German composers for collections of music. In compositional practise, numbering musical works in chronological order dates from [[17th century]] Italy, especially [[Venice]]. In common usage, the word ''Opus'' is used to describe the best work of an artist with the term ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. "opus". Retrieved from http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/132110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Etymologically, the words ''opus'' (singular) and ''opera'' (plural) are related to the Latin words ''opera'' (singular) and ''operae'' (plural), the ancestor of the Italian words ''opera'' (singular) and ''opere'' (plural). In English usage, besides the word ''opus'', the word ''opera'' occasionally was used to identify a musical work. In contemporary usage, however, the word ''opera'' specifically denotes the dramatic musical genre of [[opera]] or [[ballet]], which were developed in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. "[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/131729 opera, n. 1]", "[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/131730 opera, n. 2]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early usage==
In the arts, an opus number usually denotes a work of [[musical composition]], a practice and usage established in the seventeenth century when composers identified their works with an opus number. In the eighteenth century, publishers usually assigned opus numbers when publishing groups of like compositions, usually in sets of three, six or twelve compositions. Consequently, opus numbers are not usually in chronological order, unpublished compositions usually had no opus number, and numeration gaps and sequential duplications occurred when publishers issued contemporaneous editions of a composer’s works, as in the sets of [[string quartet]]s by [[Joseph Haydn]] (1732–1809) and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770–1827); Haydn's Op. 76, the [[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)|Erdödy quartets]] (1796–97), comprises six discrete quartets consecutively numbered Op. 76 No. 1&amp;nbsp;– Op. 76 No. 6; whilst Beethoven's Op. 59, the [[String Quartets Nos. 7–9, Op. 59 – Rasumovsky (Beethoven)|Rasumovsky quartets]] (1805–06), comprises String Quartet No. 7, String Quartet No. 8, and String Quartet No. 9.

==19th century to date==
From about 1800, composers usually assigned an opus number to a work or set of works upon publication. After approximately 1900, they tended to assign an opus number to a composition whether published or not. However, practices were not always perfectly consistent or logical. For example, early in his career, Beethoven selectively numbered his compositions (some published without opus numbers), yet in later years, he published early works with high opus numbers. Likewise, some posthumously published works were given high opus numbers by publishers, even though some of them were written early in Beethoven's career. Since his death in 1827, the un-numbered compositions have been catalogued and labelled with the German acronym WoO (''Werk ohne Opuszahl''), meaning "work without opus number"; the same has been done with other composers who used opus numbers. (There are also other catalogues of Beethoven's works&amp;nbsp;– see [[Catalogues of Beethoven compositions]].)

The practice of enumerating a posthumous opus ("Op. posth.") is noteworthy in the case of [[Felix Mendelssohn]] (1809–47); after his death, the heirs published many compositions with opus numbers that Mendelssohn did not assign. In life, he published two [[symphony|symphonies]] ([[Symphony No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 11]]; and [[Symphony No. 3 (Mendelssohn)|Symphony No. 3 in A minor, Op. 56]]), furthermore he published his symphony-cantata ''[[Lobgesang]]'', Op. 52, which was  posthumously counted as his Symphony No. 2; yet, he chronologically wrote symphonies between symphonies Nos. 1 and 2, which he withdrew for personal and compositional reasons; nevertheless, the Mendelssohn heirs published (and catalogued) them as the [[Symphony No. 4 (Mendelssohn)|''Italian'' Symphony No. 4 in A major, Op. 90]], and as the [[Symphony No. 5 (Mendelssohn)|''Reformation'' Symphony No. 5 in D major and D minor, Op. 107]].

While many of the works of [[Antonín Dvořák]] (1841–1904) were given opus numbers, these did not always bear a logical relationship to the order in which the works were written or published. To achieve better sales, some publishers, such as [[N. Simrock]], preferred to present less experienced composers as being well established, by giving some relatively early works much higher opus numbers than their chronological order would merit. In other cases, Dvořák gave lower opus numbers to new works to be able to sell them to other publishers outside his contract obligations. This way it could happen that the same opus number was given to more than one of his works.  Opus number 12, for example, was assigned, successively, to five different works (an opera, a concert overture, a string quartet, and two unrelated piano works). In other cases, the same work was given as many as three different opus numbers by different publishers. The sequential numbering of his symphonies has also been confused: (a) they were initially numbered by order of publication, not composition; (b) the first four symphonies to be composed were published after the last five; and (c) the last five symphonies were not published in order of composition. The ''[[New World Symphony]]'' originally was published as No. 5, later was known as No. 8, and definitively was renumbered as No. 9 in the critical editions published in the 1950s.

Other examples of composers' historically inconsistent opus-number usages include the cases of [[César Franck]] (1822–1890), [[Béla Bartók]] (1881–1945), and [[Alban Berg]] (1885-1935), who initially numbered, but then stopped numbering their compositions. [[Carl Nielsen]] (1865–1931) and [[Paul Hindemith]] (1895–1963) were also inconsistent in their approaches. [[Sergei Prokofiev]] (1891–1953) was consistent and assigned an opus number to a composition ''before'' composing it; at his death, he left fragmentary and planned, but numbered, works. In revising a composition, Prokofiev occasionally assigned a new opus number to the revision; thus [[Symphony No. 4 (Prokofiev)|Symphony No. 4]] is two thematically related but discrete works: Symphony No. 4, Op. 47, written in 1929; and Symphony No. 4, Op. 112, a large-scale revision written in 1947. Likewise, depending upon the edition, the original version of Piano Sonata No. 5 in C major, is catalogued both as Op. 38 and as Op. 135.

Despite being used in more or less normal fashion by a number of important early-twentieth-century composers, including [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (1874-1951) and [[Anton Webern]] (1883-1945), opus numbers became less common in the later part of the twentieth century.

==Other catalogues==
{{main|Catalogues of classical compositions}}
To manage inconsistent opus-number usages&amp;nbsp;— especially by composers of the [[Baroque]] (1600–1750) and of the [[Classical music era|Classical]] (1720—1830) music eras&amp;nbsp;— [[musicology|musicologists]] have developed comprehensive and unambiguous catalogue number-systems for the works of composers such as:

* [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]&amp;nbsp;— catalogued with a '''BWV'''-number; a ''[[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]]'' number assigned by [[Wolfgang Schmieder]]; however, older sources occasionally use '''S'''-numbers.
* [[Dietrich Buxtehude]]&amp;nbsp;— catalogued with a '''BuxWV'''-number, a ''Buxtehude-Werke-Verzeichnis'' work number.
*  [[Frédéric Chopin]]&amp;nbsp;— three catalogue systems have been applied: (i) '''B'''-numbers, by Maurice J.E. Brown; (ii) '''KK'''-numbers, by [[Krystyna Kobylańska]]; and (iii) work-letters ('''A''', '''C''', '''D''', '''E''', '''P''' and '''S'''), by Józef Michał Chomiński. Generally, these alternative music-catalogue systems identified compositions that the composer had not numbered.
* [[Claude Debussy]]&amp;nbsp;— identified with an '''L'''-number, per [[François Lesure]]'s comprehensive catalogue.
* [[Antonín Dvořák]]&amp;nbsp;— identified with a '''B'''-number, per [[Jarmil Burghauser]]'s comprehensive catalogue; which resolved the problems of different and duplicate opus-numbers assigned by the publishers of Dvořák's music.
* [[Joseph Haydn]]&amp;nbsp;— identified with a '''Hob.'''-number, per the 1957 catalogue by [[Anthony van Hoboken]]. Although he assigned Hoboken-numbers to the [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn|string quartets]], those compositions usually are known by opus numbers.
* [[Franz Liszt]]&amp;nbsp;— identified with an '''S'''-number, per the catalogue ''The Music of Liszt'' (1960), by [[Humphrey Searle]].
* [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]&amp;nbsp;— identified either with a '''K'''-number or with a '''KV'''-number (''[[Köchel catalogue|Köchel-Verzeichnis]] nummer''), per the catalogue system of [[Ludwig Ritter von Köchel]].
* [[Niccolò Paganini]]&amp;nbsp;— identified with an '''MS'''-number, per the 1982 ''Catalogo tematico'', by [[Moretti and Sorrento]].
* [[Domenico Scarlatti]]&amp;nbsp;— identified with three catalogue systems; (i) '''L'''-numbers, per the 1906 catalogue by [[Alessandro Longo]]; (ii) '''K'''-numbers and '''Kk'''-numbers, per the 1953 catalogue by [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]]; and (iii) '''P'''-numbers, per the 1967 catalogue by [[Giorgio Pestelli]].
* [[Franz Schubert]]&amp;nbsp;— identified with a '''D'''-number, per the [[Deutsch catalogue|catalogue of Otto Erich Deutsch]].
* [[Maurice Ravel]]&amp;nbsp;— identified with an '''M'''-number, per the 1986 [[List of compositions by Maurice Ravel|catalogue]] by [[Marcel Marnat]].

'''Peary Chand Mitra''' ({{lang-bn|প্যারীচাঁদ মিত্র}}; 22 July 1814 – 23 November 1883) was an Indian writer, journalist, cultural activist and entrepreneur.&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul |year=2012 |chapter=Mitra, Peary Chand |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mitra,_Peary_Chand |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pseudo name is Tekchand Thakur. He was a member of [[Henry Louis Vivian Derozio|Henry Derozio's]] [[Young Bengal]] group, who played a leading{{clarify|date=December 2013}} role in the [[Bengal renaissance]] with the introduction of simple Bengali prose. His ''Alaler Gharer Dulal'' pioneered the novel in the [[Bengali language]], leading{{clarify|date=December 2013}} to a tradition taken up by [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] and others. Mitra died on 23 November 1883 in Kolkata.

==Early life==
Mitra was born at [[Calcutta]] on 22 July 1814. His father, Ramnarayan Mitra, moved from Panisehala, [[Hooghly district|Hooghli District]] to Calcutta in early life and made his fortunes as banians&lt;ref&gt;Banians are local brokers and agents to the European merchants in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries&lt;/ref&gt; to European merchants and officials.&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt; As per the custom of the day, he started learning [[Persian language|Persian]] at a young age and in 1827 joined the [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Hindu College]],&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt; where he started learning English. While still a student he started a school in his own home to teach others in his locality what he learnt. At some point in time his friends [[Rasik Krishna Mallick]], [[Radhanath Sikdar]] and [[Sib Chandra Deb]] joined him to bolster his efforts. [[David Hare (philanthropist)|David Hare]] and Derozio helped him as well.

==Career==
Mitra joined Calcutta Public Library as deputy librarian in 1836.&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt; The library was established the same year in the residence of an Englishman named Strong in the Esplanade. It was later shifted to [[Fort William College]] and when the Metcalfe Hall was constructed to pay respect to the memory of [[Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe|Charles Metcalfe]], the library was moved to the hall in 1844. Mitra rapidly rose up the ladder as librarian, secretary and finally curator, a position he held till his retirement.

He was associated with a variety of social welfare activities of his day. He was a member of the Calcutta University Senate, the society for prevention of cruelty to animals, and Bethune Society. He was secretary of the British India Society (later Association). He was also a [[Justice of the peace|Justice of the Peace]].

He had interest in the development of agriculture in the country. His criticism of the permanent settlement, ''The Zemindar and Ryots'', created a sensation. While a member of the Agricultural Society, he started an organisation for the translation of books on agriculture from English to Bengali. In 1881, when [[Madame Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott|Col Olcott]] visited India, he became involved with the [[Theosophical Society]].

==Journalism and literary work==
Mitra is particularly known for his contribution to the development of journalism and Bangla literature. He was a regular contributor to the ''Englishman'', ''Indian Field'', ''Hindu Patriot'', ''Friend of India'', ''Calcutta Review'', ''Bengal Harkara'' and ''Bengal Spectator''.&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt; Along with his Derozian friend Rasik Krishna Mallick, he edited the ''Jnananeswan''. Another Derozian, Ram Gopal Ghosh, was associated with it.

His major literary works include:

* ''[[Alaler Gharer Dulal]]'' (1857)
* ''Mad Khaoya Bada Day Jat Thakar ki Upay'' (1859)
* ''Ramaranjika'' (1860)
* ''Krsipath'' (1861)
* ''Bamatoshini'' (1881)
* ''Abhedi'' (1871)
* ''Jatkinchit'' (1865)
* ''Adhyantika'' (1881)
In English he wrote ''A Biographical Sketch of David Hare'' (1877), ''The Spiritual Stray Leaves'' (1879), ''Stray Thought of Spiritualism'' (1879), and ''Life of Dewan Ramkamal Sen'' (1880) and an essay named ''The Zamindar and Royats.''&lt;ref name="bpedia" /&gt; That was the age when [[Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar]] was writing Bengali heavily loaded with Sanskrit words and [[Akshay Kumar Datta]] was experimenting with the language in [[Tattwabodhini Patrika]]. Both were masters of Sanskrit and used all the ornamentation of that rich language. Bengali prose was in its infancy. Learned people used to poke fun at it and ridiculed the language, and a newspaper such as Iswar Chandra Gupta's ''[[Sambad Prabhakar]]'' published all that.

In 1857, Mitra and Radhanath Sikdar started a small magazine, ''Masik Patrika'', which used simple spoken Bengali prose everybody could understand. It was a major breakthrough in the use of Bengali, and the magazine instantly became popular. His novel ''Alaler Gharer Dulal'', written under the pseudonym Tek Chand Thakur, used simple Bengali prose, closer to the spoken speech of the day, and was serialised in the magazine. It was one of the earliest Bengali novels and became an instant success.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hana Catherine Mullens]] wrote ''Phoolmani O Karunar Bibaran'' in 1852. This is regarded as the first novel in Bengali; ''Alaler Gharer Dulal'' was published in 1858, as per ''Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan'' page 423. Harinath Mazumdar wrote a novel ''Bijay Basanta'' at the same time as per ''Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj'', page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; So great was its popularity that the language style came to be known as 'Alali'. That set the trend for Bengali prose then. In 1864, [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]] published his first novel ''Durgeshnandini'' to finally lay down the standard for Bengali prose. ''Alaler Ghare Dulal'' was later translated into English.

===''Dickens of Bengal''===
Rev. James Long, who was a keen observer of the literary scene in Bengal, and was imprisoned and fined for the English translation of the controversial play ''[[Nil Darpan]],'' used to call him 'the [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] of Bengal'.

==Entrepreneurship==
In later life, Mitra became a successful businessman.  He was partner and director of companies like Great Eastern Hotel Company Ltd., Port Canning Grand Investment Co, and Howrah Docking Co.&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt; Along with his Derozian friend Tarachand Chuckervertty, he was involved in export-import business ''Pearychand &amp; Tarachand Limited''.

== Family==
Mitra had a brother [[Kishori Chand Mitra]], a civil servant. He had four sons{{snd}}Amrita Lal Mitra, Chuuni Lal Mitra, Heera Lal Mitra and Nagendra Lal Mitra and a daughter Uma Shashi Mitra.

'''Pochuri''', or '''Pochuri Naga''', is an [[Angami–Pochuri languages|Angami–Pochuri]] language spoken in [[Nagaland]], [[India]].

According to ''Ethnologue'', Pochuri is spoken in 27 villages of Meluri subdivision, [[Phek district]], southeastern [[Nagaland]]. There are also some speakers in [[Ukhrul district]], [[Manipur]] (''Ethnologue'').

Maluri (Meluri), which is often considered a dialect of Pochuri, may be a distinct language.&lt;ref&gt;van Driem 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8573">'''Pre-Christian Slavic writing''' is a hypothesized writing system that may have been used by the Slavs prior to [[Christianization]] and the introduction of the [[Glagolitic]] and [[Cyrillic]] alphabets. No extant evidence of pre-Christian Slavic writing exists, but early Slavic forms of writing or [[proto-writing]] may have been mentioned in several early medieval sources.

==Evidence from early historiography==
The 9th century Bulgarian&lt;ref&gt;http://pravoslavieto.com/history/09/Chernorizets_Hrabur/index.htm#bio&lt;/ref&gt; writer, [[Chernorizets Hrabar]] in his work ''An Account Of Letters'' ({{lang-bg|О писменех, O pismeneh}}) briefly mentioned that, before Christianization, Slavs used a system he had dubbed  "strokes and incisions" or "tallies and sketches" in some translations ([[Old Church Slavonic]]: {{lang|cu-Cyrl|чръты и рѣзы}}). He also provided information critical to Slavonic [[palaeography]] with his book.

{{quote|Before, the Slavs did not have their own books, but read and divined by means of strokes and incisions, being pagan. Having become Christian, they had to make do with the use of Roman and Greek letters without order [unsystematically], but how can one write [Slavic] well with Greek letters...&lt;ref group=note&gt;In this place are listed eleven examples of Slavic words, such as живѣтъ /živět/ "life", which can by hardly written using the unadapted Roman or Greek letters (i.e. without [[diacritic]] changing their sound-values).&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it was for many years.|&lt;ref&gt;[http://pech-dvor.su/texts/xrabr.htm Old Church Slavonic text of ''An Account of Letters'' (a Russian site)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313025021/http://pech-dvor.su/texts/xrabr.htm |date=2012-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another contemporaneous source, [[Thietmar of Merseburg]], describing a temple on the island  of [[Rügen]], a [[Cape Arkona|Slavic pagan stronghold]], remarked that the idols there had their names carved out on them ("singulis nominibus insculptis," Chronicon 6:23 ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/thietmar/edition/text.html Thietmarus Merseburgensis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] describes the manners and customs of the [[Rus' people|Rus]], who arrived on a business trip in [[Volga Bulgaria]]. After a ritual ship burial of their dead tribesmen, Rus left an inscription on the tomb:

{{quote|Then they constructed in the place where had been the ship which they had drawn up out of the river something like a small round hill, in the middle of which they erected a great post of birch wood, on which they wrote the name of the man and the name of the Rus king and they departed.|&lt;ref&gt;'''Ibn Fadlan''', ''on the Rus merchants at Itil, 922''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Ibn Fadlan doesn't leave many clues about the ethnic origin of the people he described (see [[Rus' people|Rus]]).

==Evidence from archaeology==
[[File:Гнёздовская надпись.png|thumb|Inscription on Kerch amphora with word гороухща (''goruhšča'').]]

*In 1949, a Kerch amphora was found from [[Gnezdovo]] in [[Smolensk Oblast]] with the earliest inscription attested in the [[Old Russian language]]. The excavator has inferred that the word гороухща (''goruhšča''), inscribed on the pot in Cyrillic letters, designates [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] that was kept there.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Great Soviet Encyclopaedia]], 2nd ed. Article "Гнездовская надпись".&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation has not been universally accepted and the inscription seems to be open to different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roman Jakobson]], Linda R. Waugh, Stephen Rudy. ''Contributions to Comparative Mythology''. Walter de Gruyter, 1985. Page 333.&lt;/ref&gt; The dating of the inscription to the mid-10th century&lt;ref&gt;The latest coins found in the same burial go back to 295 [[Islamic calendar|AH]], i.e. to 906–907 CE.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests a hitherto unsuspected popularity of the Cyrillic script in pre-Christian Rus.
*Of the three [[Runic]] inscriptions found in ancient Rus, only one, from [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]], predates the Gnezdovo inscription.

== Evidence from etymology ==
{{Synthesis|date=August 2011}}
The [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word for "to write", ''{{lang|sla|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/pьsati|pьsati]]}}'' ({{lang-pl|pisać}}, {{lang-ru|писать}}, {{lang-cs|psát}}, {{lang-sk|písať}}) derives from a [[Common Balto-Slavic]] word for "to paint, smear", found in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]  ''{{lang|lt|[[:wikt:piešti|piẽšti]]}}'' "paint, write", ''{{lang|lt|paĩšas}}'' "smudge", ''{{lang|lt|puišinas}}'' "sooty, dirty", from the same root as Old Slavic ''{{lang|cu|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/pьstrъ|pьstrъ]]}}''  (also ''{{lang|cu|pěgъ}}'') "coloured" (Greek {{lang|grc|ποικίλος}}), ultimately from a [[PIE]] root ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/peyḱ-|*peik-]]}}'' "speckled, coloured" (Latin ''{{lang|la|pingō}}'' "paint", [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] ''{{lang|xto|pik-}}'', ''{{lang|txb|pink-}}'' "paint, write"). This indicates that the Slavs named the new art of writing in ink, as "smearing, painting", unlike English which, with Old English ''*{{lang|gem|(w)rītan}}'' English ''[[wikt:write|write]]'', transferred the term for "incising ([[rune]]s)" to manuscript writing. The other Germanic languages use terms derived from Latin [[wikt:scribo#Latin|''scribere'']]. A Slavic term for "to incise" survives in [[Old Church Slavonic|OCS]] ''{{lang|cu|[[:wikt:жрѣбъ|žrěbъ]]}}'' "lot" originally the incision on a wooden chip used for [[Runic divination|divination]] ([[Russian language|Russian]] {{lang|ru|[[:wikt:жребий|жребий]]}} "number, tally mark", from the same root as Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:γράφω|γράφω]]}}).

== Evidence against ==
In the "Life of Saint Cyril-Constantine the Philosopher", [[Rastislav_of_Moravia|Rastislav]], the duke of Moravia sent an embassy to Constantinople asking [[Emperor Michael III]] to send learned men to the Slavs of [[Great Moravia]], who being already baptised, wished to have the liturgy in their own language, and not Latin and Greek. Emperor called for [[Saints_Cyril_and_Methodius|Constantine]] and asked him if he would do this task, even though being in poor health. Constantine replied that he would gladly travel to Great Moravia and teach them, as long as the Slavs had their own alphabet to write their own language in, to which the Emperor replied that '''not even his [[Michael_II|grandfather]] and [[Theophilos_(emperor)|father]] and let alone he could find any evidence of such an alphabet'''. Constantine was distraught, and was worried that if he invents an alphabet for them he'll be labelled a heretic.
{{Quote|title=Life of Saint Cyril-Constantine the Philosopher, Chapter XIV|{{Script/Slavonic|Събравъ же съборъ Цѣсар̑ь призъва Кѡнстантїна Фїлософа, и сътвори и слꙑшати рѣчь сьѭ. И рече: Вѣмь тѧ трѹдьна сѫшта, Фїлософе, нъ потрѣба ѥстъ тебѣ тамо ити; сеѩ бо рѣчи не можетъ инъ никътоже исправити ꙗкоже тꙑ. Отъвѣшта же Фїлософъ: И трѹдьнъ сꙑ и больн̑ь тѣломь, съ радостьѭ идѫ тамо, аште имѣѭтъ бѹкъви въ ѩзꙑкъ свой. И рече Цѣсар̑ь къ нѥмѹ: Дѣдъ мой и отьць и ини мъноѕи искавъше того, не сѫтъ того обрѣли, то како азъ могѫ то обрѣсти? Фїлософъ же рече: То къто можетъ на водѫ бесѣдѫ напьсати и ѥретїчьско имѧ обрѣсти?}}}}
Even if some form of writing existed among the Slavs in previous centuries, by the 9th century the learned men in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] were not aware of its existence in any of the Slavic lands that they had sent missionaries or ambassadors to. Either this writing had died out or it wasn't a real form of writing, but rather just "tallies and sketches" as mentioned in Chernorizets Hrabar's ''An Account Of Letters'', using which books could not be written.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1057">In the framework of [[Yale]] linguist [[Laurence Horn]]'s [[Neo-Gricean]] approach to [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]],  '''Q-based narrowing''' or a "Q-based implicature" is an inference that results from application of the [[Q-Principle]] "Say as much as you can [given R]," as it interacts with the [[R-Principle]] "Say no more than you must [given Q]." &lt;ref name=SEP&gt; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/ "Implicature"] in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] The [[Q-Principle]] is a reformulation of Grice's Maxim of Quantity (''see'' [[Gricean maxims]]) combining with it Grice's first two submaxims of Manner.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Q-based inference is built around the assumption that if the speaker did not make a stronger statement (or say more), then its denial is (implied to be) true. For instance, the inference from "He entered a house" to "He did not enter his own house" is Q-based inference, i.e. deriving from the Q-Principle. &lt;ref name = SEP/&gt;

'''Rawa''' or '''Rao''' is a term given to a [[Minangkabau people]] who come from Rao, [[West Sumatra]]. In the [[Malay Peninsula]], now the West Malaysia, it's common for the Rawa to identify themselves as ''Ughang Rawo'' or ''Ughang Rao'' or even Rao.

==History==

The Rawa or Rao people came to [[Malaysia]] from Rao and Mapat Tunggul villages, in [[Pasaman]], [[West Sumatera]], [[Indonesia]] in 1773 to 1848 to [[Negeri Sembilan]], in 1857 to 1863 to [[Pahang]], in 1867 to 1873 to [[Selangor]], in 1875 to 1876 to [[Perak]] and some in [[Kelantan]].

==Population==

The population spread around [[Perak]], several parts in Penang, Selangor and Pahang. [[Gopeng]], a small town in Perak is a well-known town for its Rawa community who is still preserving most of its tradition and dialect for centuries, way before the formation of Malaysia.

==Dialect==
 {{Infobox language

}}
Among the most notable suffixes used by the Rawa is kuak, sang, tang. For instance:

* Bak mano tang means "''how could that be''"
* Ompek ringgit sang means "''four ringgit only''"
* Nyonyo nak bergolek kuak means "''maybe he wants to sleep''"
* Oma citen ku means "''my butt are hurt''"

Other significant phrases such as:

* Bak siko cipier to means "''give me the plate''"
* Ondeik! Gudang utak bak nyonyo means "''owh! stubborn just like him''"
* Beserendeng tukong means "''carrying things excessively/overloaded''"

* Ako ngincah/kincah kain isowk means "''i'll rinse the clothes tomorrow''"
* Bak kato jako...means "''like i just said''"
* Aghri Senoyen means "''Monday''"
* Pukol ompek karang nyo means "''its at 4 o'clock''"
* Kao idak poie menjongouwk means "''will you be going for the funeral?''"
* Abeih berkerotang sado alahnyo means "''everything is a complete mess''" (when the mouth gets messy with foods while eating)
* Hopak! bergayo tang kawo genaghain/genarin means "''Wow! you looks stylish nowadays''"
* Sempureh kawo! means "''to hell with you!''" (offensive)
* Ku sipak kang means "''i'll kick you''" (offensive)
* Abeih tekelayak means "''it tears apart''" (specifically for open wound)
* Indo ku podah! means "''I don't want to!''"

The Rawa is well known for its distinctive deep vocabulary and exquisite grammar, very different from the ordinary [[Malay language|Bahasa Melayu]] or Standard Malay speakers.

==Rawa Cuisine==

The '''Kelamai''', '''Gulai Nangko''' and '''Asom Iken Koli''' (or Asam Ikan Keli as in Standard Malay Language), have become the signature cuisine of the Rawa community in which they mastered every inch of its details and procedures. Many tourist who joined the Gopeng Homestay Program in Gopeng will experiencing these wonderful cuisine. The Kelamai or pronounce as Kelamei is a sweet dark brown delicacy similar to the Lemang . It is cooked for hours inside a specifically chosen bamboo under very tedious supervision. Not to mention the complicated pre cook procedures of preparing the down.

==Tradition==

'''Adet Berjojak''' or '''Adat Berjejak''' (''in standard Malay'') is a traditional ritual usually practiced for children. There are very detail protocols and constrains to abide upon completion.

== Early life and education ==
Richard Henry Geoghegan was born on 8 January 1866 in [[Birkenhead]], [[Cheshire]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]].

When he was three years old, Geoghegan suffered a fall on the stairs at home, as a result of which he was crippled for life, walking with difficulty and often with the help of a cane. From an early age he displayed extraordinary intellectual abilities, especially in the learning of languages. Around the age of 17, he became interested in Oriental writing systems and entered the [[University of Oxford]], in January 1884, to study [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. There he showed himself to be an outstanding student, twice receiving scholarship awards, but he never obtained a degree. At Oxford, Chinese remained a nondiploma field of study until 1936.

== Esperanto activities ==
In the autumn of 1887, when the language [[Esperanto]] had just appeared, Geoghegan read an article about it and immediately wrote to the language's creator, [[L. L. Zamenhof]], in Latin. Zamenhof sent Geoghegan a German edition of his ''[[Unua Libro]]''. Having learned the language from this book in short order, a while later Geoghegan received from Zamenhof the first copies of the same book in an English translation by the Warsaw Jew J. St. (pseudonym of Julian Steinhaus). Geoghegan warned Zamenhof that this translation was a mess, and it would only make a laughingstock of Esperanto in the English-speaking world. Subsequently, Zamenhof asked Geoghegan to produce a more suitable translation himself, which he did. The translation by Steinhaus was withdrawn, and in 1889 Geoghegan's was published. In the ''Unua Adresaro'', an early directory of supporters of Esperanto, Geoghegan appears as number 264.

== Emigration to Washington State ==
Geoghegan left Oxford at the end of 1887 and was an instructor of classical languages in [[London]] until 1891, when he&amp;mdash;along with his widowed mother and siblings&amp;mdash;emigrated to the village of [[Eastsound, Washington|Eastsound]] in the northwestern [[United States]]. Not finding an opportunity to support himself in the fishing/farming economy there, in 1893 he went to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], in the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], where he worked as a stenographer for an Anglican bishop, and later in the same capacity for the English and Japanese consulates.

He founded, together with two or three other linguists, the Washington State Philological Society, and contributed several valuable dissertations to it on the relationship between ancient oriental and American writing systems and on calendar systems. Meanwhile, he unsuccessfully sought a position as professor of Chinese language at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], and the early days of 1903 he accepted an invitation by the well-known judge [[James Wickersham]] to come to [[Alaska]] as a court stenographer. In 1905 he was elected as the first president of the newly formed American Esperanto Association, but in fact he was unable to preside due to his absence.

== Relocation to Alaska ==
Despite the rigorous climate and rough gold mining environment, the informal Alaskan lifestyle and the opportunity to study firsthand [[Aleut language|Aleut]] and other native languages of the region appealed to Geoghegan. Except for the year 1905, which he spent in Seattle (where the Seattle Esperanto Society was founded primarily under his influence and that of his friend, William G. Adams), and 1914, when he traveled through the western United States and [[Japan]], Geoghegan remained a resident of Alaska until his death on 27 October 1943. Because of his physical handicaps, Geoghegan was of a retiring nature and remained single until 1916. In that year, infatuated with Ella Joseph-de-Saccrist, he married her, but only secretly, under the advice of friends, because of racial prejudices that existed at that time: Ella, who came from [[Martinique]], was known as a black. She died in 1936. (This explains why in many biographies one reads that he never married.)

Geoghegan lived simply, often in primitive log cabins, at various addresses in the city of [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]]. He always remained faithful to Esperanto, to whose Lingva Komitato (''Language Committee'') he was elected immediately upon its formation in 1905. For him, however, Esperanto was mainly a written language. The first person with whom he actually spoke it was Wilhelm Heinrich Trompeter, who visited him in [[Eastsound, Washington|Eastsound]] in the 1890s. His valuable book collection, including many original letters from Zamenhof and other pioneers, as well as other rare artifacts about little known&amp;mdash;mainly oriental&amp;mdash;languages, were destroyed when the family home in Eastsound burned down in 1906. Probably Geoghegan's most noteworthy linguistic contribution was the compilation of a dictionary and grammar for the [[Aleut language]] of the Alaskan islands, on which he labored from the time of his arrival in [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], Alaska, en 1903. It was finally published only after his death, in 1944, and remains even today the principal English language work on the subject.

In [[cryptography]], '''rubber-hose cryptanalysis''' is a [[euphemism]] for the extraction of cryptographic secrets (e.g. the password to an encrypted file) from a person by [[coercion]] or [[torture]]&lt;ref name=CNET_20081024&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13739_3-10069776-46.html |title=Turkish police may have beaten encryption key out of TJ Maxx suspect |date=October 24, 2008 |first=Chris |last=Soghoian |authorlink=Christopher Soghoian |work=Surveillance State |publisher=[[CNET Networks]] |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/10/rubber_hose_cry.html |title=Rubber-Hose Cryptanalysis |first=Bruce |last=Schneier |authorlink=Bruce Schneier |date=October 27, 2008 |work=Schneier on Security |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;—such as beating that person with a rubber [[hose]], hence the name—in contrast to a mathematical or technical [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic attack]].

== Details ==

According to [[Amnesty International]] and the [[United Nations|UN]], many countries in the world routinely torture people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)14730-7/fulltext |title=Exposing the horror of torture |first=Stephen |last=Pincock |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=362 |issue=9394 |pages =1462–1463 |date=November 1, 2003 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14730-7 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |pmid=14603923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_2004_10_27"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=12364&amp;Cr=torture |title=Many countries still appear willing to use torture, warns UN human rights official |publisher=[[United Nations|UN]] News Service |date=October 27, 2004 |accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)03218-9/fulltext |title=Torture and trauma in post-conflict East Timor |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=356 |issue=9243 |page=1763 |date=November 18, 2000 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03218-9 |first1=J. |last1=Modvig |first2=J. |last2=Pagaduan-Lopez |first3=J. |last3=Rodenburg |first4=CMD |last4=Salud |first5=RV |last5=Cabigon |first6=CIA |last6=Panelo |archiveurl=http://members.pcug.org.au/~wildwood/Lancet.htm |archivedate=August 27, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |pmid=11095275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)65892-8/fulltext |title=Turkish physicians coerced to conceal systematic torture | authorlink = Vincent Iacopino | first=Vincent |last=Iacopino |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=348 |issue=9040 |page=1500 |date=November 30, 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)65892-8 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |pmid=11654536}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore logical to assume that at least some of those countries use (or would be willing to use) some form of rubber-hose cryptanalysis.&lt;ref name=CNET_20081024/&gt; In practice, [[Coercion#Psychological|psychological coercion]] can prove as effective as physical [[torture]]. Not physically violent but highly intimidating methods include such tactics as the threat of harsh legal penalties. The incentive to cooperate may be some form of [[plea bargain]], such as an offer to drop or reduce criminal charges against a suspect in return for full co-operation with investigators. Alternatively, in some countries threats may be made to prosecute as co-conspirators (or inflict violence upon) close relatives (e.g. spouse, children, or parents) of the person being questioned unless they co-operate.&lt;ref name="UN_2004_10_27"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animatedsoftware.com/hightech/philspgp.htm |title=Interview with author of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) |date=February 2, 1996 |first=Russell D. |last=Hoffman |work=High Tech Today |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some contexts, rubber-hose cryptanalysis may not be a viable attack because of a need to decrypt data covertly; information such as a password may lose its value if it is known to have been compromised.  It has been argued that one of the purposes of strong cryptography is to force adversaries to resort to less covert attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsdcan.org/2010/schedule/attachments/135_crypto1hr.pdf |title=Everything you need to know about cryptography in 1 hour (conference slides) |date=May 13, 2010 |first=Colin |last=Percival |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known use of the term was on the [[sci.crypt]] newsgroup,{{Citation needed|reason=No evidence cited that this use was the first known use of the term|date=February 2014}} in a message posted 16 October 1990 by [[Marcus J. Ranum]], alluding to [[foot whipping|corporal punishment]]:

{{quote|...the rubber-hose technique of cryptanalysis. (in which a rubber hose is applied forcefully and frequently to the soles of the feet until the key to the cryptosystem is discovered, a process that can take a surprisingly short time and is quite computationally inexpensive).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url=http://groups.google.com/group/sci.crypt/msg/86404637e708d900?pli=1 |title=Re: Cryptography and the Law... |first=Marcus J. |last=Ranum |newsgroup=sci.crypt |message-id=1990Oct16.050000.4965@decuac.dec.com |date=October 16, 1990 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the term is used [[tongue-in-cheek]], its implications are serious: in modern cryptosystems, the weakest link is often the human user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/vpns/weakest-link-human-factor-lessons-learned-german-wwii-enigma-cryptosystem_738|title=The Weakest Link: The Human Factor Lessons Learned from the German WWII Enigma Cryptosystem|publisher=SANS|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[brute force attack|direct attack]] on a cipher algorithm, or the [[cryptographic protocol]]s used, is likely to be much more expensive and difficult than targeting the people who use or manage the system. Thus, many cryptosystems and security systems are designed with special emphasis on keeping human vulnerability to a minimum. For example, in [[public-key cryptography]], the defender may hold the key to encrypt the message, but not the decryption key needed to decipher it. The problem here is that the defender may be unable to convince the attacker to stop coercion. In plausibly [[deniable encryption]], a second key is created which unlocks a second convincing but relatively harmless message (for example, apparently personal writings expressing "deviant" thoughts or desires of some type that are lawful but taboo), so the defender can prove to have handed over the keys whilst the attacker remains unaware of the primary hidden message. In this case, the designer's expectation is that the attacker will not realize this, and forego threats or actual torture. The risk, however, is that the attacker may be aware of deniable encryption and will assume the defender knows more than one key, meaning the attacker may refuse to stop coercing the defender even if one or more keys are revealed: on the assumption the defender is still withholding additional keys which hold additional information.

== In law ==

In some jurisdictions, statutes assume the opposite—that human operators know (or have access to) such things as session keys, an assumption which parallels that made by rubber-hose practitioners. An example is the United Kingdom's [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]],&lt;ref name="Guardian Q&amp;As"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/oct/24/qanda | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=The RIP Act | date=October 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RIP online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldbills/061/2000061.htm|title=Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill; in Session 1999-2000, Internet Publications, Other Bills before Parliament|publisher=House of Lords|date=9 May 2000|accessdate=5 Jan 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108020103/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldbills/061/2000061.htm|archivedate=8 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it a crime not to surrender [[Key (cryptography)|encryption keys]] on demand from a government official authorized by the act.

According to the [[Home Office]], the burden of proof that an accused person is in possession of a key rests on the prosecution; moreover, the act contains a defense for operators who have lost or forgotten a key, and they are not liable if they are judged to have done what they can to recover a key.&lt;ref name="Guardian Q&amp;As"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RIP online"/&gt;

==Possible case==
In the lead-up to the [[Kenyan general election, 2017|2017 Kenyan general election]], the head of information, communication, and technology at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, Christopher Msando, [[Kenyan general election, 2017#Msando murder|was murdered]]. He had played a major role in developing the new voting system for the election. His body showed apparent marks of torture, and there were concerns that the murderers had tried to get password information out of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=David Pilling|title=Ghost of Chris Msando haunts Kenyan election|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1cfa53ae-7e7a-11e7-9108-edda0bcbc928|work=Financial Times|date=Aug 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shona''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|oʊ|n|ə}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; (''chiShona'') is the most widely spoken [[Bantu language]] as a [[first language]] and is native to the [[Shona people]] of [[Zimbabwe]]. The term is also used to identify peoples who speak one of the Central Shona varieties: Zezuru, Karanga, Manyika and Korekore. Based on [[Clement Doke]]'s 1931 report, Union Shona or Standard Shona was developed from the Central Shona varieties. Because of the presence of the capital city in the Zezuru region, that variety has come to dominate in Standard Shona.

The larger group of historically related languages (called [[Shona languages]] by linguists) also includes Ndau (Eastern Shona) and Karanga (Western Shona), but speakers of those languages prefer their distinct identities and usually reject any connection to the term Shona.

==Speakers==
Shona is the most spoken Bantu language in Southern Africa by the criterion of number of native speakers. According to ''Ethnologue'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sna Ethnologue's Shona entry]&lt;/ref&gt; Shona, comprising the Karanga, Zezuru and Korekore dialects, is spoken by about 10.8 million people. The [[Manyika language|Manyika]] and [[Ndau language|Ndau]] dialects of Shona&lt;ref&gt;Stabilization in the Manyika Dialect of the Shona Group, Hazel Carter, Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, Vol. 26, No. 4, Oct., 1956, pp. 398-405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report on the Unification of the Shona Dialects. By Clement M. Doke. 1931&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plc.sas.upenn.edu/shona University of Pennsylvania Language Center]&lt;/ref&gt; are listed separately by ''Ethnologue'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1934-16 Ethnologue's list of Shona (S.10) languages]&lt;/ref&gt; and are spoken by 1,025,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mxc Ethnologue's Manyika entry]&lt;/ref&gt; and 2,380,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ndc Ethnologue's Ndau entry]&lt;/ref&gt; people, respectively. The total figure of Shona speakers is then about 14.2 million people. [[Zulu language|Zulu]] is the second most widely spoken [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] with 10.3 million speakers according to ''Ethnologue''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size Ethnologue's list of languages by size]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruction==
[[File:Wikipedia-logo-v2-sn.png|thumb|Wikipedia in the Shona language.]]
Shona is a written standard language with an [[orthography]] and [[grammar]] that was codified during the early 20th century and fixed in the 1950s. In the 1920s, the Rhodesian administration was faced with the challenge of preparing schoolbooks and other materials in the various languages and dialects and requested the recommendation of the South African linguist [[Clement Doke]].

The first novel in Shona, [[Solomon Mutswairo]]'s ''Feso'', was published in 1957. Shona is taught in the schools but is not the general medium of instruction in other subjects. It has a literature and is described through monolingual and bilingual [[dictionary|dictionaries]] (chiefly Shona – English). Standard Shona is based on the dialect spoken by the Karanga people of Masvingo Province, the region around [[Great Zimbabwe]], and Zezuru people of central and northern Zimbabwe. However, all Shona dialects are officially considered to be of equal significance and are taught in local schools.

==Classification==
Shona is a member of the large family of [[Bantu languages]]. In [[Malcolm Guthrie|Guthrie's]] zonal classification of Bantu languages, zone S10 designates a [[dialect continuum]] of closely related varieties, including Zezuru, Karanga, [[Manyika language|Manyika]], and [[Ndau language|Ndau]], spoken in Zimbabwe and central Mozambique; Tawara and Tewe, found in Mozambique; and Nambya and [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]] in Botswana and Western Zimbabwe.

==Origins==
[[File:Shona witch doctor (Zimbabwe).jpg|thumb|Shona n'anga or traditional healer (Zimbabwe)]]
Shona speakers most likely moved into present-day Zimbabwe from the [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe|Mapungubwe]] and K2 communities in [[Limpopo]], South Africa, before the influx of European, primarily British, colonizers. A common misconception is that the speakers of the Karanga dialect were absorbed into the Ndebele culture and language turning them into Kalanga. The Kalanga language is widely spoken in Botswana where the Ndebele were never present. The Kalanga language is thought to have been the language used by the Mapungubweans.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Archeology, Wits University&lt;/ref&gt; If this is accurate it follows that the Karanga dialect of Shona is a derivative of Kalanga. Karanga is closer to Kalanga than the rest of the aforementioned dialects. Karanga and Kalanga are both closer to [[Venda language|Venda]] than the other Shona dialects.

==Dialects==

Shona is used to refer to a standardised language based on the central dialects of the Shona region. Shona languages form a dialect continuum from the Kalahari desert in the west to the Indian Ocean in the east and the Limpopo river in the south and the Zambezi in the north. While the languages are related, evolution and separation over the past 1000 years has meant that mutual intelligibility is not always possible without a period of acculturation. Therefore, Central Shona speakers have a difficult time understanding Kalanga speakers even though lexical sharing can be over 80% with some western Karanga dialects. In the same manner eastern dialects (Shanga) spoken by the Indian Ocean are also very divergent. There are many dialect differences in Shona, but a standardized dialect is recognized. According to information from Ethnologue (when excluding S16 Kalanga):

* S14 '''Karanga dialect''' (Chikaranga). Spoken in southern Zimbabwe, near [[Masvingo]].
:Subdialects: Duma, Jena, Mhari (Mari), Ngova, Venda (not the [[Venda language]]), Nyubi (spoken in Matabeleland at the beginning of the [[Zimbabwe#Colonial era (1888–1965)|colonial period]] is now extinct), Govera.

* S12 '''Zezuru dialect''' (Chizezuru, Bazezuru, Bazuzura, Mazizuru, Vazezuru, Wazezuru). Spoken in [[Mashonaland]] and central Zimbabwe, near [[Harare]]. The standard language.
:Subdialects: Shawasha, Gova, Mbire, Tsunga, Kachikwakwa, Harava, Nohwe, Njanja, Nobvu, Kwazvimba (Zimba).

* S11 '''Korekore''' dialect (Northern Shona, Goba, Gova, Shangwe). Spoken in northern Zimbabwe, near Mvurwi.
:Subdialects: Budya, Gova, Tande, Tavara, Nyongwe, Pfunde, Shan Gwe.

Languages with partial intelligibility with Shona, of which the speakers are considered to be ethnically Shona, are the S15 [[Ndau language]], spoken in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and the S13 [[Manyika language]], spoken in eastern Zimbabwe, near Mutare. Ndau literacy material has been introduced into primary schools.

Maho (2009) recognizes Korekore, Zezuru, Manyika, Karanga, and Ndau as distinct languages within the Shona cluster, with Kalanga being more divergent.&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

==Phonology and alphabet==
All [[syllable]]s in Shona end in a vowel. Consonants belong to the next syllable. For example, ''mangwanani'' ("morning") is syllabified as ''ma.ngwa.na.ni;'' "Zimbabwe" is ''zi.mba.bwe.''

=== Vowels ===
Shona's five [[vowels]] are pronounced as in Spanish: {{IPA-sn|a, e, i, o, u|}}.  Each vowel is pronounced [[Hiatus (linguistics)|separately]] even if they fall in succession. For example, "Uno enda kupi?" (Where do you go?) is pronounced {{IPA|[u.no.e.nda.ku.pi]}}.

===Whistled sibilants===
{{expert needed|Languages|section|ex2=Africa|date=August 2008| reason = we need a better explanation &amp; preferably some sound files }}
Shona and other languages of Southern and Eastern Africa include [[whistled sibilant|whistling sounds]], unlike most other languages where whistling signals a speech disorder (this should not be confused with [[whistled speech]]).

Shona's whistled sibilants are the [[fricative]]s "sv" and "zv" and the [[affricate]]s "tsv" and "dzv".

Whistled sibilants stirred interest among the Western public and media in 2006, due to questions about how to pronounce the name of [[Morgan Tsvangirai]], the leader of the [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai]] in Zimbabwe.  The BBC Pronunciation Unit recommended the pronunciation "chang-girr-ayi" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|æ|ŋ|g|ɪ|r|eɪ|i}}.

===Old alphabet===
From 1931 to 1955, Unified Shona was written with an alphabet developed by the linguist Professor [[Clement Martyn Doke]].  This included the following letters:

:[[ɓ]] (b with hook),
:[[ɗ]] (d with hook), 
:[[ŋ]] (n with leg),
:[[ȿ]] (s with swash tail), 
:[[ʋ]] (v with hook), 
:[[ɀ]] (z with swash tail).

In 1955, these were replaced by letters or digraphs from the basic Latin alphabet.  For example, today {{angle bracket|sv}} is used for {{angle bracket|ȿ}} and {{angle bracket|zv}} is used for {{angle bracket|ɀ}}.

A '''telephone call''' is a connection over a [[telephone network]] between the [[called party]] and the [[calling party]].

==First telephone call==
The first telephone call was made on March 10, 1876 by [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. Bell demonstrated his ability to "talk with electricity" by transmitting a call to his assistant, Thomas Watson. The first words transmitted were "Mr Watson, come here. I want to see you." {{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}
 
This event has been called Bell's "greatest success", as it demonstrated the first successful use of the telephone.&lt;ref&gt;

|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]

|last=Alfred

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was his greatest success, he refused to have one in his own home because it was something he invented by mistake and saw it as a distraction from his main studies.{{Citation needed|date = May 2016}}

==Information transmission==
A [[telephone]] call may carry ordinary [[Human voice|voice]] transmission using a telephone, [[data transmission]] when the calling party and called party are using [[modem]]s, or [[Fax|facsimile]] transmission when they are using [[fax]] machines.  The call may use [[land line]], [[mobile phone]], [[satellite phone]] or any combination thereof. When a telephone call has more than one [[called party]] it is referred to as a [[conference call]]. When two or more users of the network are sharing the same physical line, it is called a [[Party line (telephony)|party line]] or Rural phone line.

[[File:Photograph of First Lady Betty Ford Reading a Newspaper, while President Ford Talks on the Telephone, in the Second... - NARA - 186793.tif|thumb|left|U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]] on the [[land line|phone]]]]
If the caller's wireline phone is connected directly to the calling party, when the caller takes their telephone [[off-hook]], the calling party's phone will ring.  This is called a [[hot line]] or [[ringdown]].  Otherwise, the calling party is usually given a [[Dial tone|tone]] to indicate they should begin dialing the desired number.  In some (now very rare) cases, if the calling party cannot dial calls directly, they will be connected to an [[Switchboard operator|operator]] who places the call for them.

Calls may be placed through a public network (such as the [[Public Switched Telephone Network]]) provided by a commercial [[telephone company]] or a private network called a [[Private branch exchange|PBX]].  In most cases a private network is connected to the public network in order to allow PBX users to dial the outside world.  Incoming calls to a private network arrive at the PBX in two ways: either directly to a users phone using a [[Direct inward dialing|DDI number]] or indirectly via a receptionist who will answer the call first and then manually put the caller through to the desired user on the PBX. {{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

Most telephone calls through the PSTN are set up using [[ISDN User Part|ISUP]] signalling messages or one of its variants between [[telephone exchange]]s to establish the end to end connection.  Calls through PBX networks are set up using [[QSIG]], [[DPNSS]] or variants.

==Costs==
Some types of calls are not charged, such as [[local call]]s (and internal calls) dialed directly by a telephone subscriber in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Hong Kong]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]] or [[New Zealand]] (Residential subscribers only).  In most other areas, all telephone calls are charged a fee for the connection.  Fees depend on the provider of the service, the type of service being used (a call placed from a [[landline]] or wired telephone will have one rate, and a call placed from a [[Mobile telephone number|mobile telephone]] will have a different rate) and the distance between the calling and the called parties. In most circumstances, the calling party pays this fee. However, in some circumstances such as a reverse charge or [[collect call]], the called party pays the cost of the call.  In some circumstances, the caller pays a [[flat rate]] charge for the telephone connection and does not pay any additional charge for all calls made.  Telecommunication liberalization has been established in several countries to allows customers to keep their local phone provider and use an alternate provider for a certain call in order to save money.

==Placing a call==
[[File:Jean-Marc Doussain.JPG|thumb|An early 21st century [[mobile phone]] being used for a phone call]]
A typical phone call using a traditional phone is placed by picking the phone handset up off the base and holding the handset so that the hearing end is next to the user's ear and the speaking end is within range of the mouth. The caller then [[rotary dial]]s or presses buttons for the phone number needed to complete the call, and the call is routed to the phone which has that number. The second phone makes a ringing noise to alert its owner, while the user of the first phone hears a ringing noise in its earpiece. If the second phone is picked up, then the operators of the two units are able to talk to one another through them. If the phone is not picked up, the operator of the first phone continues to hear a ringing noise until they hang up their own phone.

One of the main struggles for Alexander Graham Bell and his team was to prove to non-English speakers that this new phenomenon "worked in their language." It was a concept that was hard for people to understand at first.

In addition to the traditional method of placing a telephone call, new technologies allow different methods for initiating a telephone call, such as [[voice dialing]]. [[Voice over IP]] technology allows calls to be made through a [[Personal computer|PC]], using a service like [[Skype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roos|first=Dave|title=How VoIP Works|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/ip-telephony9.htm|publisher=How Stuff Works|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other services, such as toll-free dial-around enable callers to initiate a telephone call through a third party without exchanging phone numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How VoIP Service Works|url=https://www.uwtcallback.com/otherSvcs/voip/how_it_works.html|publisher=United World Telecom|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, no phone calls could be made without first talking to the [[Switchboard operator]]. Using 21st century mobile phones does not require the use of an operator to complete a phone call.

The use of [[Headset (audio)|headsets]] is becoming more common for placing or receiving a call. Headsets can either come with a cord or be [[wireless]].

A special number can be dialed for [[operator assistance]], which may be different for local vs. long-distance or international calls.

==Tones==
Preceding, during, and after a traditional telephone call is placed, certain [[call progress tone|tones]] signify the progress and status of the telephone call:
* a [[dial tone]] signifying that the system is ready to accept a [[telephone number]] and connect the call
* either:
** a [[ringback tone|ringing tone]] signifying that the called party has yet to answer the telephone
** a [[Busy signal (telephony)|busy signal]] (or engaged tone)  signifying that the called  party's telephone is being used in a telephone call to another person (or is "off the hook" though no number has been dialled, i.e. the customer does not want to be disturbed)
** a fast busy signal (also called [[reorder tone]] or overflow busy tone) signifying that there is congestion in the telephone network, or possibly that the calling subscriber has delayed too long in dialling all the necessary digits.  The fast busy signal is generally twice as fast as the normal busy signal.
* [[status tones]] such as STD notification tones (to inform the caller that the telephone call is being [[Subscriber trunk dialling|trunk dialled]] at a greater cost to the calling party), minute minder beeps (to inform the caller of the relative duration of the telephone call on calls that are charged on a time basis), and others
* a tone (sometimes the busy signal, often the dial tone) to signify that the called party has hung up.
* tones used by earlier [[in-band signaling|inband]] telephone switching systems were simulated by a Red box or a [[Blue box (phreaking)|blue box]] used by "[[phreaking|phone phreaks]]" to illegally make or receive free trunk/toll calls.
* [[off-hook tone]] if the phone has been picked up but no number dialed for an extended period of time.
[[Cell phone]]s generally do not use dial tones, because the technology used to transmit the dialed number is different from a landline.

==Unwanted calls==
{{main|Nuisance call}}

Unsolicited telephone calls are a modern nuisance. Common kinds of unwanted calls include [[prank call]]s, [[telemarketing]] calls, and [[obscene phone call]]s.

Caller ID provides some protection against unwanted calls, but can still be turned off by the calling party. Even where end-user Caller ID is not available, calls are still logged, both in billing records at the originating telco and via [[automatic number identification]], so the perpetrator's phone number can still be discovered in many cases. However, this does not provide complete protection: harassers can use payphones, in some cases, automatic number identification itself can be spoofed or blocked, and mobile telephone abusers can (at some cost) use "throwaway" phones or SIMs.

'''The Tortoise and the Birds''' is a [[fable]] of probable folk origin, early versions of which are found in both India and Greece. There are also African variants. The moral lessons to be learned from these differ and depend on the context in which they are told.

==Early Indian versions==
[[File:Nalanda Temple 2 ei7-42.jpg|thumb|[[Nalanda]] Temple 2, 7th cent ce.]]
A tale concerning a talkative tortoise appears in the Buddhist scriptures as the ''Kacchapa [[Jataka]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/jatakatales00fran#page/180/mode/2up/search/tortoise |title=Jataka Tales, H.T.Francis and E.J.Thomas, Cambridge University, 1916, pp.178-80 |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this version, it is framed by the account of a talkative king who finds in his courtyard a tortoise that has fallen from the sky and split in two. His adviser explains that this had come about as a result of talking too much. A tortoise had become friendly with two geese who promised to take it to their home in the Himalayas. They would hold a stick in their beaks while the tortoise would grasp it in his mouth, but he must be careful not to talk. Children below made fun of it during the journey and when it answered back it fell to its destruction. Jataka tales were a favourite subject for sculpture and this story is found as a [[bas relief]] on various religious buildings in India and Java. Often depicted as [[Narrative art#synoptic narrative|synoptic narratives]], the episodes  encountered include the birds carrying the tortoise between them, its fall and its fate on reaching the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Philippe Vogel, ''The Goose in Indian Literature and Art'', Leiden 1962 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PMsUAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Hitopadesa&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=Hitopadesa&amp;f=false pp.44-6]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th century [[Mendut]] temple in Java, for example, the birds and tortoise appear at top right, while on the ground huntsmen take aim with bows.

As in the Mendut example, other versions of the story are depicted even in Buddhist contexts. In the Indian literary variation of the story in the ''[[Panchatantra]]'', the tortoise and her friends live in a lake that is beginning to dry up. Pitying the future suffering of their friend, the geese suggest they fly off with her in the manner already described. On hearing the comments of people in the city they are passing, the tortoise tells them to mind their own business. After her fall in consequence, she is cut up and eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Edgerton, ''The Panchatantra Reconstructed'', American Oriental Series, New Haven, 1924&lt;/ref&gt;  The story was eventually included in the tales of [[Bidpai]] and travelled westward via translations into Persian, [[Syriac language|Syriac]], Arabic, Greek, Hebrew and Latin. The last of these began to be translated into other European languages at the end of the Middle Ages. A still later retelling appears in the ''[[Hitopadesha]]'', where the migration occurs because of the appearance of a fisherman. Cowherds below suggest that the flying tortoise would make a good meal and it falls while making an acid response.&lt;ref&gt;J.P.Vogel, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

An Italian version of Bidpai's fables was early translated into English by [[Thomas North]] under the title of ''The Morall Philosophie of Doni'' (1570).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/earliestenglishv00doniuoft#page/170/mode/2up |title=Thomas North, the earliest English version of the fables of Bidpai, originally published in 1570, pp.171-5 |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the tortoise and the birds appears in a section illustrating the sentiment that 'a man hath no greater enemy than himself'. The French fabulist [[La Fontaine's Fables|Jean de la Fontaine]] also found the story in an early digest of Bidpai's work and added it to his fables as ''La Tortue et les deux Canards'' (X.3). For him the story illustrates human vanity and imprudence. His tortoise tires of living in the same place and decides to travel. Two ducks offer to fly her to America but, while on their way, she hears people below describe her as 'the queen of tortoises' and shouts agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oaks.nvg.org/fonta10.html#totortodu Translation of the poem]&lt;/ref&gt; It is on this that [[Alexander Sumarokov]] appears to have based his Russian version, in which the ducks set out to carry the tortoise to France.&lt;ref&gt;Item XI, "Черепаха", in [http://az.lib.ru/s/sumarokow_a_p/text_0460oldorfo.shtml  ПОЛНОЕ СОБРАНІЕ ВСѢХЪ СОЧИНЕНIЙ въ СТИХАХЪ И ПРОЗѢ, ПОКОЙНАГО ... АЛЕКСАНДРА ПЕТРОВИЧА СУМАРОКОВА] (Complete Works in Verse and Prose by the late... Alexander Petrovich Sumarokov),  Moscow, 1787&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelling eastwards too, the story exists as a [[Mongolia]]n folk tale with a different animal character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this variation, a frog is jealous of geese discussing their coming migration and complains that they are fortunate to be able to fly to a warmer climate in winter. The geese suggest the stick plan to the frog and they set off. The frog is so delighted with himself that he cannot resist shouting down to the frogs he is leaving behind and soon rejoins them disastrously.

A variation on this appears in the Russian author [[Vsevolod Garshin]]'s story called "The Traveler Frog" (Лягушка-путешественница), which was adapted into a cartoon in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;The 17-minute Russian-language version is available on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kMbFX6upjc YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; There, the frog falls because it wants to tell those below that the traveling was its own idea, and not that of the ducks that carry him. Unlike in most variants, the frog falls into a pond and survives to boast of its supposed travels.&lt;ref&gt;An English translation appears as the final story in [http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/51r.pdf this collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions in Aesop's Fables==
[[File:Tortoise and birds (Jacobs).JPG|thumb|The fable's title, designed by Richard Highway for [[Joseph Jacobs|Jacobs']] collection, 1894]]
There are two stories concerning a tortoise and various birds ascribed to [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop]], one in the Greek of [[Babrius]] and the other in the Latin of [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]]. In the Greek version, a tortoise yearns to see more of the earth and persuades the eagle to fly up with it, promising in return 'all the gifts that come from the Eastern Sea'. Once they are above the clouds, the eagle drops it onto a mountaintop. The story was given the moral that one should be content with one's lot. It spread through Europe via Latin versions in the collections of [[Avianus]] and [[Odo of Cheriton]]. Thereafter it cross-fertilised with tellings of the Indian version of the fable. The tortoise's discontent is supplied to La Fontaine's fable from this source, as it is in [[Jefferys Taylor]]'s poem ''The Tortoise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/aesopinrhymewith00tayliala#page/68/mode/2up |title=Jefferys Taylor, Aesop in Rhyme, London, 1828, pp.68-9 |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babrius gives no reason for the eagle's treachery; Avianus suggests that this was because the promised payment was not forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/avianus/2.htm |title=Aesop's Fables, a new translation by Laura Gibbs, Oxford University Press, 2002 |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the uncertainty of life, into which treachery enters, that is the subject of the alternative version of the fable, told by Phaedrus as "The Eagle and the Crow" (2.6). It begins with the comment that 'no one is sufficiently well armed against the high and the mighty, and if there is a malicious advisor involved as well, then whoever falls victim to their criminal forces will be destroyed.' To illustrate this, he relates how an eagle has seized a tortoise but cannot eat it because of the protective shell. A passing crow advises the eagle to drop the animal 'from the starry heights' onto the rocks below, after which the two birds share its meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/oxford/111.htm |title=111. THE EAGLE AND THE CROW (Laura Gibbs, translator) |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the story is retold by [[Gualterus Anglicus|Walter of England]] an element of treachery has been added. The crow meets the frustrated eagle on the ground and advises it to soar up and drop its prey. Waiting behind by the rocks, the crow flies off with the fallen tortoise before the eagle can return.

==African fables==
An Igbo fable concerning the tortoise and the birds has gained wide distribution because it occurs in the famous novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' by [[Chinua Achebe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goatrevolution.com/blog2/2009/05/31/a-tortoise-story |title=Chinua Achebe, Things Fall Apart, Ibadan NG, 1958, chapter 11 |publisher=Goatrevolution.com |date=2009-05-31 |accessdate=2013-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326173959/http://goatrevolution.com/blog2/2009/05/31/a-tortoise-story/ |archive-date=2012-03-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tortoise, who is a West African [[trickster]] figure, hears of a feast to be given by the sky-dwellers to the birds and persuades them to take him with them, winged in their feathers. There he tells the hosts that his name is 'All-of-you' and, when they provide the food with the assurance that 'This is for all of you', claims the entire feast. The enraged birds claim their feathers back and leave. Only the parrot will agree to take a message to the tortoise's wife to pull the bedding from his house and leave it on the ground. Instead the parrot tells her to bring out all the hard things so that when the tortoise jumps down its shell is broken. He survives, however, and the broken shell is glued together. This provides the explanation of why the tortoise's shell is so uneven. Much the same story is now claimed by the [[Swazi people]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iVVkoOfVRMC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=tortoise+and+the+birds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ju1UmyMWru&amp;sig=bkNQGmJwLDOqQtUGD9EgavVok3A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=b9iETOy5KZKL4gbOmL3SBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tortoise%20and%20the%20birds&amp;f=false |title=Phyllis Savory, The Best of African Folklore, Cape Town ZA, 1988, pp.24-5 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]].

==Merged stories and adaptations==
Some retellings of the tortoise fables are extended in such a way as to suggest that two stories have been merged into one. In the case of the African fable, the tortoise gets back to earth safely but the birds decide to play him a return trick. A feast is provided on the ground but it is announced that this can only be eaten by those whose claws are clean. The birds fly to the river and return to alight on their food but the tortoise, having to crawl, gets its feet dirty in returning and is sent back to try again. This time it is he who misses the feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=www.softwarehouse.it |url=http://www.readme.it/libri/Fiabe%20in%20Inglese/Tortoise,%20the%20Birds,%20and%20the%20Feasts.shtml |title=ebook Tortoisethe Birdsand the Feasts Anonimo |publisher=Readme.it |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tortoise and Birds (North).JPG|thumb|A woodblock from [[Thomas North]]'s translation of [[Bidpai]], 1570]]
In a Sri Lankan continuation of the Indian version of the fable, Ibba the tortoise similarly survives its fall to earth, only to get into the clutches of Nariya, the hungry jackal. Ibba suggests to Nariya that its shell will become soft if it is soaked in the river. At first Nariya keeps a paw on the shell but then Ibba persuades him that he is soft all over except for the dry patch under Nariya's paw. When the jackal raises it, Ibba swims to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/030727/funday/7.htm |title=Tissa Devendra, Princes, Peasants, and Clever Beasts: Sinhala Folk Stories in English, Colombo LK, 2002 |publisher=Sundaytimes.lk |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions merge stories more seamlessly. A narration in the [[Uncle Remus]] tradition from the former slave population of South Carolina combines Aesop's fable of the discontented tortoise with an African cumulative tale. Brer Terrapin grumbles so much about being earth-bound that the animals conspire to have him carried up and dropped to his death. Miss Crow takes him first and when she grows tired he is transferred in turn to the back of a buzzard, a hawk and King Eagle. When the eagle will not listen to his pleas to take him back, the tortoise climbs down a thread he ties to the eagle's leg and so escapes his fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0225a.html |title=Emma M. Backus, "Animal Tales from North Carolina", The Journal of American Folklore, 11.43 (Oct. - Dec., 1898), pp. 285-86 |publisher=Pitt.edu |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Jacobs]] similarly combines both fables of Aesop in his late retelling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/jacobs/47.htm |title=Joseph Jacobs, The Fables of Aesop, London, 1894, pp.111-12 |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the eagle is carrying the tortoise to a new home and is reminded by the crow that it is good to eat, whereupon the eagle drops it on a sharp rock and the two birds make a feast of it. This synthetic version and the moral given it, 'Never soar aloft on an enemy's pinions', is often mistaken as authentic nowadays.

'''Tsou''' is a divergent [[Formosan languages|Austronesian language]] spoken by the [[Tsou people]] of [[Taiwan]]. Tsou is a threatened language; however, this status is uncertain. The speakers are located in the west-central mountains southeast of the [[Chiayi]]/[[Alishan Range|Alishan]] area in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/tsu&lt;/ref&gt; The language is not written.&lt;ref name="english.cntv.cn"&gt;http://english.cntv.cn/program/cultureexpress/20130111/102044.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Tsou has traditionally been considered part of a [[Tsouic languages|Tsouic]] branch of Austronesian. However, several recent classifications, such as Chang (2006)&lt;ref name="Chang2006"&gt;Chang, Henry Yungli. 2006. "Rethinking the Tsouic Subgroup Hypothesis: A Morphosyntactic Perspective." In Chang, H., Huang, L. M., Ho, D. (eds.). ''Streams converging into an ocean: Festschrift in honor of Professor Paul Jen-Kuei Li on his 70th birthday.'' Taipei: Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ross (2009)&lt;ref name="Ross2009"&gt;Ross, Malcolm. 2009. "Proto Austronesian verbal morphology: A reappraisal." In Alexander Adelaar and Andrew Pawley (eds.). ''Austronesian historical linguistics and culture history: a festschrift for Robert Blust''. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; dispute the Tsouic branch, with Tsou more divergent than the other two languages, Kanakanabu and Saaroa.

==Dialects==
The dialectal variation of Tsou is not great. There are four recorded dialects: Tapangu, Tfuea, Duhtu and Iimcu, of which Tapangu and Tfuea are still spoken. Iimcu is not well described. The grammar of the other three dialects is nearly identical, and phonological variation is marginal: In certain environments, Tapangu /i/ corresponds to Tfuea and Duhtu /z/ or /iz/, and Duhtu had /r/ for Tfuea and Tapangu /j/. (Actually, older speakers were recorded to vary between [r] and [j], but at that point the dialect was moribund.)

The Tsou language is spoken in the following villages (Li 1979, Zeitoun 2005). All of the villages are located in [[Alishan Township]] 阿里山鄉, [[Chiayi County]] 嘉義縣 except for Mamahavana 久美 (Jiumei), which is located in [[Xinyi Township|Hsinyi/Xinyi Township]] 信義鄉, [[Nantou County]] 南投縣. Both the native Tsou names and Chinese names are given.

==Phonology==
The description of Tsou phonology below is from Wright &amp; Ladefoged (1994).

===Vowels===
Tsou has six vowels, {{IPA|/i ɨ u e o ɑ/}}. Vowel sequences occur, including sequences of like vowels ({{IPA|/ii/}} etc.), but these are separate [[Mora (linguistics)|moras]] rather than long vowels or diphthongs.  Vowels, especially back vowels, are [[centralization|centralized]] when flanked by voiceless [[alveolar consonant]]s ({{IPA|/t, ts, s/}}). This may involve a central offglide, so that {{IPA|/o/}} is pronounced as a diphthong {{IPA|[öə̯]}} or {{IPA|[ɵə̯]}} in this environment.

===Consonants===
{|class="wikitable" style=text-align:center

|-

|{{IPA|p}}||{{IPA|t}}||{{IPA|k}}||{{IPA|ʔ}}

|-
!colspan=2| [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]
|{{IPA|w}}||colspan=2|{{IPA|ɹ~j}} || 
|}
The [[approximant consonant|approximants]] {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} may surface as non-syllabic [[mid vowel]]s {{IPA|[e̯]}} and {{IPA|[o̯]}}, even (for {{IPA|/j/}}) in initial position ({{IPA|/jo~joskɨ/ [e̯oˈe̯oskɨ]}} "fishes"; {{IPA|/w/}} does not occur in initial position), explaining the spelling ''Tfuea'' ({{IPA|/tfuja/}}) for the name of the dialect. However, stress assignment ({{IPA|[ˈtfue̯a]}}) and restrictions on consonant clusters (see stress and phonotactics below) demonstrate that they behave as consonants.

The plosives are not [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]]. Phonetically aspirated stops are actually sequences of stop plus {{IPA|/h/}}, as can be seen by the fact that they cannot cluster with a third consonant (see phonotactics below), and by morphological alternations such as {{IPA|/phini/}} ~ {{IPA|/mhini/}} "to trade".

According to [[spectrogram|spectrum analysis]], {{IPA|/h/}} appears to be a glottal fricative in most environments, but approaches a velar {{IPA|[x]}} next to the central vowel {{IPA|/ɨ/}}, as in {{IPA|/tsaphɨ/}} 'palm, sole'. However, the fact that the sequences {{IPA|/hʔ/}} and {{IPA|/ʔh/}} occur, when no other [[homorganic]] sequence is allowed, suggests that {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/ʔ/}} may not both be glottal. (Additional evidence that {{IPA|/h/}} might best be analyzed as velar is the fact that {{IPA|*/kh/}} is not found, and that {{IPA|/hk/}} is only found medially, in the single known word {{IPA|/kuhku/}} "fox".)

The voiceless sibilants, {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/s/}}, are palatalized to {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʃ]}} before the front vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}. However, the voiced sibilant {{IPA|/z/}} is not affected by this environment.

The implosives {{IPA|/ɓ/}} and {{IPA|/ɗ/}} are uncommon. Both may be glottalized ({{IPA|[ʔɓ], [ʔɗ]}} or maybe {{IPA|[ʔb], [ʔd]}}) in intervocalic position. In addition, alveolar {{IPA|/ɗ/}} has some unusual [[allophony]]: About a third of speakers pronounce it with a [[lateral release (phonetics)|lateral release]], or before {{IPA|/a/}} as a lateral approximant {{IPA|[l]}}, as in {{IPA|/ɗauja/ [lauja]}} "maple". Indeed, Tsuchida (1976) transcribed it as a preglottalized lateral, {{IPA|[ˀl]}}.

===Stress===
With a few exceptions, stress is not only predictable, but shifts when suffixes are added to a word. It falls on the penultimate vowel, or on the penultimate [[mora (linguistics)|mora]] if a moraic analysis is adopted. That is, a final heavy syllable (double vowel) receives stress ({{IPA|[eˈmoo]}} "house"); otherwise, stress falls on the penultimate syllable ({{IPA|[oˈkosi]}} "his child"). Additional stress falls in a [[trocha]]ic pattern: Every other light syllable (single vowel) also receives stress. Unstressed vowels are deleted, except at word boundaries (initial or final vowel) and unless doing so would create a forbidden consonant cluster (see below).

For example, the verb {{IPA|//seʔe-nətəh-a//}} "to cut with a bolo" takes stress on the syllables {{IPA|//tə//}} and {{IPA|//ʔe//}}, and is realized as {{IPA|[sʔenˈtəha]}}. However, this does not explain all consonant clusters, many of which are lexically determined.

===Phonotactics===
The most complex syllable in Tsou is [[consonant|C]]C[[vowel|V]][[V]]. Tsou is unusual in the number of [[consonant cluster]]s that it allows. [[Homorganic]] clusters are not allowed, unless one is a nasal consonant, and a maximum of two consonants may occur together, but otherwise about half of possible sequences are known to occur. For example, all non-homorganic sequences starting with /t/ and /ts/ are found. Missing clusters may not be allowed, or may simply be accidental gaps due to limited knowledge of the lexicon.

In clusters of [[oral stop]]s, both have an audible release burst. This is true even between vowels, an environment where the first stop has [[no audible release]] in most languages, supporting an analysis of these clusters as part of the [[syllable onset]], with no [[syllable coda]]s occurring in the language.

Stops, oral or nasal, may or may not have a release burst before a nasal stop, depending on the speaker. The initial clusters {{IPA|/hp, ht, hʔ/}} are unusual cross-linguistically. The spectrum shows that the tongue moves towards an alveolar articulation during the {{IPA|/h/}} of {{IPA|/ht/}}, demonstrating that it is not articulated as a velar. The initial clusters {{IPA|/pʔ/}} and {{IPA|/tʔ/}} are sometimes realized as two released stops, but sometimes with a single release, resembling [[ejective consonant]]s in other languages. ({{IPA|/kʔ/}} is again notably missing, except intervocalically, despite the fact that {{IPA|[kʼ]}} is the most common ejective cross-linguistically.)

==Grammar==

===Syntax===
Like most other [[Austronesian languages]], Tsou displays a predicate-initial syntax.

Tsou has three main types of questions (Zeitoun 2005:282).
#Yes-no questions
#Alternative questions
#Wh-questions (information questions)

Tsou has the following types of clauses:
#Verbal
##Declarative
##Imperative
##(Verbal) interrogative
#Equational
#Existential (no auxiliary verbs are allowed)

Important function words are:
*''zou'' - "to be"
*'''a'' - "it is in case that"
*''o'ta'' - (it is) not (in case that)"
*''pan'' - "there is" / existential
*''uk'a'' - negative existential (usually followed by ''ci'')
*''o'a'' - negation of a fact or event
*''ci'' - relativizer
*'''o'' - prohibition (AV constructions)
*''av'a'' - prohibition (UV constructions)

Case markers are as follows, with nominative forms placed before slashes and oblique forms placed after them (Zeitoun 2005:274). The nominative form is given when there are no slashes.
*'''e'' - visible and near speaker
*''si / ta'' - visible and near hearer
*''ta'' - visible but away from speaker
*'''o / to'' - invisible and far away, or newly introduced to discourse
*''na / no ~ ne'' - non-identifiable and non-referential (often when scanning a class of elements)

===Word classes===
Tsou nouns are distinguished from verbs by the presence of case markers and suffixed genitive pronouns, both of which cannot be applied to verbs (Zeitoun 2005:264). Verbs, on the other hand, have elaborate voice marking. Adjectives and certain adverbs actually function as verbs, since they also undergo voice inflection and are placed at the same positions within clauses as verbs (i.e., predicate-initial).

Tsou is unique for not having any preposition-like elements, instead using nouns or verbs to express these notions.

===Verbs===
Main verbs can take on three types of voices (Zeitoun 2005:284).
#Patient voice: ''-a''
#Locative voice: ''-i''
#Instrumental/benefactive voice: ''-(n)eni''

Tsou verbs can be divided into five major classes (I, II, III-1, III-2, IV, V-1, V-2) based on morphological alternations (Zeitoun 2005:285). Tsou verbs do not have as many morphological distinctions as other Formosan languages do, since the Tsou language makes more extensive use of auxiliary verbs. For instance, there are no temporal/aspectual distinctions, separate markings for imperatives, and stative/dynamic distinctions. Nevertheless, Tsou still preserves the causative ''poa-'' (allomorphs: ''p-, pa-'').

Tsou auxiliary verbs can carry temporal/aspectual and modal information as well as voice. They are marked for the following voices:
#Actor voice (AV)
#Undergoer voice (UV)

These auxiliary verbs can be divided into three classes:
#AV constructions - ''mio, mo, mi-, moso, mo(h)-''
#UV constructions - ''i-, o(h)-''
#AV/UV constructions - ''te, ta, tena, nte, ntoso, nto(h)-, la''

Tsou has the following aspectual suffixes:
#''-cu/-c'u'' - already
#''-n'a'' - still, just, about to
#''-la'' - once

===Pronouns===
The personal pronouns below are from the Tfuya dialect of Tsou, and are sourced from Zeitoun (2005:265). Note that third-person pronouns are distinguished between those that are visible (abbreviated ''vis.'' below) or non-visible.

==Numerals==
Tfuya Tsou numerals are (Zeitoun 2005:265):
#coni ; 10. m-as-kʉ
#yuso ; 20. m-pus-ku
#tuyu ; 30. m-tuyu-hu
#sʉptʉ ; 40. m-sʉptʉ-hʉ
#eimo ; 50. m-eimo-hʉ
#nomʉ ; 60. m-onmʉ-hʉ
#pitu ; 70. m-pʉtvʉ-hʉ
#voyu ; 80. m-voyvʉ-hʉ
#sio ; 90. m-sio-hʉ

Tens are derived with the [[circumfix]] (confix) ''m- -hʉ''. There is also a u/ʉ vowel harmony phenomenon.

==Language endangerment==
These people live in the mountainous areas because dominating colonizers were in Taiwan for over 380 years. Outsiders have killed the indigenous people, burned villages, and forced them to move as the colonizers claimed more and more spaces. Some such colonizers were the Dutch, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese. The outside rulers imposed their own education systems on the indigenous people, but the most notable influence came from the [[Kuomintang]] era, where Taiwanese people were forced to use [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and where children were punished at school if they used their own indigenous language. This forced the original [[Taiwanese people]] to give up their language in order to survive in the new, imposed environment.&lt;ref name="jan.ucc.nau.edu"&gt;http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jar/LIL.pdf#page=40&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to globalization, people are always in search of finding better lives if they’re not completely happy, and young people are leaving the villages and looking for jobs in big cities. Because of this, children are not using the language and are not getting exposed to the culture as frequently, which means the language is not getting passed down to future generations.&lt;ref name="jan.ucc.nau.edu"/&gt;

One survey from 1999 found that only 9% of the indigenous children could speak their native language, and most children preferred to use Mandarin, which is the official Taiwan language. Tsou is mostly used by community elders in ceremonies and certain gatherings. Unfortunately, since the parents are not fluent and do not view the language as practical for children, the language is rarely spoken at home.&lt;ref name="jan.ucc.nau.edu"/&gt; The language is found more in school settings where children attend cultural learning programs.&lt;ref name="english.cntv.cn"/&gt;

The Tsou language is recognized by the government. The government has allocated money dedicated to bring language programs to elementary and junior high schools, but the funds are sometimes inconsistent, which negatively affects the programs. It helped that the [[Martial law]] was lifted in 1987 and that people could freely speak their native languages again, however, so many other dominant languages were used that several native indigenous languages disappeared.&lt;ref name="jan.ucc.nau.edu"/&gt;

The elders care about their language and worry that it may not survive in the future, so they welcome any help linguists may provide. In addition, the community has programs to maintain the language. One example is when children get to sing Tsou folk songs in kindergarten and continue to become exposed to other cultural programs through elementary school. People are relying heavily on these kids to keep the language, music, and culture alive.&lt;ref name="english.cntv.cn"/&gt; There are programs for elementary and middle school kids to learn the language. Community members are very willing to get involved with events. It is difficult to teach the language because there is a lack of good teaching materials. Schools do not make learning the indigenous language a priority because if an event deemed more important occurs, teachers are likely to put off the language lesson. In addition, students have to worry about studying [[English language|English]], Mandarin, and entrance exam materials, so time is limited and the ethnic language is not a priority in the minds of the younger generation.&lt;ref name="jan.ucc.nau.edu"/&gt;

{{Aliyah}}
An '''ulpan''' ({{lang-he-n|אולפן}}) is an institute or school for the intensive study of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Ulpan (plural '''ulpanim''' '{{Hebrew|אולפנים}}) is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word meaning "studio", "teaching", or "instruction".

The ulpan is designed to teach adult [[olim|immigrants]] to [[Israel]] the basic language skills of conversation, writing and comprehension. Most ulpanim also provide instruction in the fundamentals of [[Israeli culture]], history, and geography. The primary purpose of the ulpan is to help new citizens to be integrated as quickly and as easily as possible into the social, cultural and economic life of their new country.

==History==
The concept of the ulpan was initiated soon after the [[creation of Israel]] in 1948. The new country was faced with a massive influx of new immigrants, refugees from [[World War II|war-torn]] Europe, oppressed and disadvantaged communities from [[Africa]] and the Middle East, and others from all parts of the world. Their language and culture varied widely. The ulpan was created to help them learn the Hebrew language and assimilate into the culture.

Ulpan Etzion in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Baka, Jerusalem|Baka]] neighborhood was established in 1949 by Mordechai Kamerat as a model for Hebrew language education used across Israel. It was a residential facility for single [[Aliyah|olim]] between the ages 21 and 35 holding a bachelor's degree. Staff and students said that the atmosphere of the campus, its central location and the high quality of teaching, made it a sought-after destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Local-Israel/In-Jerusalem/Closure-of-Bakas-Ulpan-Etzions-spells-end-of-an-era|title=Closure of Baka's Ulpan Etzion's spells end of an era|author=|date=|website=jpost.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Ulpan Etzion's notable alumni was Israeli satirist [[Ephraim Kishon]]. News anchor [[Haim Yavin]] taught there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.jafi.org.il/papers/2001/march/jpmar29.htm|title=Absorbing culture|author=|date=|website=www1.jafi.org.il|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution of the ulpan continues to serve immigrants today. There are numerous private facilities but the majority are run by the [[Jewish Agency]], municipalities, [[kibbutzim]], and the universities. Ulpanim used to be free to new immigrants (''[[Aliyah|olim]]'') to Israel. Nowadays the cost can vary depending on the type and length of the course. Since the establishment of the first ulpan in Jerusalem in 1949, more than 1.3 million new immigrants have graduated from ulpanim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelforus.com/info_ulpan.html|title=What is Ulpan|first=Israel For|last=Us|date=|website=www.israelforus.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Vietnamese following the Hebrew teacher in the Ulpan at the Absorption Center in Afula.jpg|thumb|Ulpan for Vietnamese refugees in [[Afula]], 1979]]
The ulpan framework has been adopted by other nations attempting to revive their own declining or lost languages. [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Norway]] have used the ulpan model for native language instruction. Certain language courses in Wales and Scotland have even retained the name "ulpan" (spelled "[[Wlpan]]" in Welsh and [[Ùlpan]] in Scottish Gaelic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/ll/wfa/wlpan.php.en|title=Lifelong Learning at Bangor University|first=Bangor|last=University|date=|website=www.bangor.ac.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulpan.co.uk/u/|title=Ulpan in Gaelic|author=|date=|website=ulpan.co.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724111104/http://www.ulpan.co.uk/u/|archivedate=24 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sami people]] of [[Norway]] sent a delegation to Israel in 2012 in order to experience Israel's ulpan program and apply its methods toward the preservation of its own threatened linguistic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheslow|first=Daniella|title=Nordic people see hope of preserving culture, language in Hebrew revival|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/art/lifestyle/2012/03/12/334277/Nordic-people.htm|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=[[The China Post]]|date=12 March 2012|agency=[[The Associated Press|AP]]|location=[[Jerusalem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kibbutz ulpan==
A number of [[kibbutzim]] across Israel also offer ulpan courses. The course typically lasts 5 months and  the Ulpanists will usually work part-time on the kibbutz (either 4 hours a day or 8 hours every other day, depending on the kibbutz) in addition to their studies.

Participants have the option of choosing kibbutz ulpan programs either on religious kibbutzim in the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] (HaKibbutz HaDati), or on secular kibbutzim.

==Criticism of ulpan method==

A government study in 2007 has shown that even after five months of intensive Hebrew study at ulpan, sixty percent of new immigrants over the age of thirty cannot read, write or speak Hebrew at a minimum level. The situation amongst the Russian immigrant population is even more dire with seventy percent of immigrants not being able to understand the Hebrew television news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/813198.html|title=haaretz.com - Most ulpan graduates over 30 are unable to read or write Hebrew fluently|author=|date=|website=haaretz.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this study, the [[Knesset]] has set up an inter-ministerial committee to study the situation and make recommendations to improve and change the ulpan system. Several alternative teaching systems are being considered for use in the ulpan framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://212.143.66.228/protocols/data/rtf/alia/2006-12-26.rtf Inter-ministerial committee discusses the crisis in the ulpan system (in Hebrew)]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  History  ==
When Aileen Lee originally coined the term "unicorn" in 2013, there were only thirty-nine companies that were considered unicorns.&lt;ref&gt;Fan, Jennifer S. "Regulating Unicorns: Disclosure and the New Private Economy." BCL Rev. 57 (2016): 583.&lt;/ref&gt; In a different study done by the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', it was determined that startups founded between 2012 and 2015 were growing in valuation twice as fast as companies from startups founded between 2000 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2016/01/how-unicorns-grow|title=How Unicorns Grow|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, 16 US companies became unicorns, resulting in 119 private companies worldwide valued at $1 billion or more.&lt;ref name=MN&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/10/09/venture-capital-bay-areas-lucid-motors-zoox-uber-scored-the-most-in-third-quarter/ |title=Venture capital: Bay Area’s Lucid Motors, Zoox, Uber scored the most in third quarter |author=Levi Sumagaysay |date=October 9, 2018 |publisher=[[Mercury News]] |access-date=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons behind the rapid growth of unicorns ==

==== Fast-growing strategy ====
According to academics in 2007, investors and venture capital firms are adopting the [[get big fast]] (GBF) strategy for startups. GBF is a strategy where a startup tries to expand at a high rate through large funding rounds and price cutting to gain an advantage on market share and push away rival competitors as fast as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, J. D., Henderson, R., Beinhocker, E. D., &amp; Newman, L. I. (2007). Getting big too fast: Strategic dynamics with increasing returns and bounded rationality. ''Management Science'', ''53''(4), 683-696.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid exponential returns through this strategy seems to be attractive to all parties involved. However, there is always the cautionary note of the [[dot-com bubble]] of 2000 and the lack of long-term sustainability in value creation of the companies born from the [[Internet age]].

==== Company buyouts ====
Many unicorns were created through buyouts from large public companies. In a low interest rate and slow-growth environment, many companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google focus on acquisitions instead of focusing on capital expenditures and development of internal investment projects.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2015/03/18/whats-feeding-the-growth-of-the-billion-dollar-unicorn-startups/#5549f1182654|title=What's Feeding The Growth Of The Billion-Dollar 'Unicorn' Startups?|last=Howe|first=Neil|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some large companies would rather bolster their businesses through buying out established technology and business models rather than creating it themselves.

==== Increase of private capital available ====
The average age of a technology company before it goes public is 11 years, as opposed to an average life of four years back in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21659722-tech-boom-may-get-bumpy-it-will-not-end-repeat-dotcom-crash-fly|title=To fly, to fall, to fly again|date=2015-07-25|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-03-30|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new dynamic stems from the increased amount of private capital available to unicorns and the passing of [[Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act|The US Jumpstart our Business Startups (JOBS) Act]] in 2012, which increased the amount of shareholders a company can have by a multiple of four before the company had to disclose its financials publicly. The amount of private capital invested in software companies has increased three-fold from 2013 to 2015.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/grow-fast-or-die-slow-why-unicorns-are-staying-private|title=Grow fast or die slow: Why unicorns are staying private|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prevent IPO ====
Through many funding rounds, companies do not need to go through an [[initial public offering]] IPO to obtain a capital or a higher valuation; they can just go back to their investors for more capital. IPOs also run the risk of devaluation of a company if the public market thinks a company is worth less than its investors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A few recent examples of this situation were [[Square, Inc.|Square]], best known for its mobile payments and financial services business, and [[Trivago]], a popular German hotel search engine, both of which were priced below their initial offer prices by the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/square-ipo-prices-at-9-a-share-below-11-to-13-range-1447893733|title=Square’s $9-a-Share Price Deals Blow to IPO Market|last=Demos|first=Telis|date=2015-11-19|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-31|last2=Driebusch|first2=Corrie|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/16/trivago-ipo-opens-at-1120-after-pricing-at-11-below-its-expected-range.html|title=Trivago IPO opens at $11.20 after pricing at $11, below its expected range|last=Balakrishnan|first=Anita|date=2016-12-16|website=CNBC|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because of the severe over-valuation of both companies in the private market by investors and venture capital firms. The market did not agree with both companies' valuations, and therefore, dropped the price of each stock from their initial IPO range.

Investors and startups also do not want to deal with the hassle of going public because of increased regulations. Regulations like the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] have implemented more stringent regulations following several bankruptcy cases in the US market that many of these companies want to avoid.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Technological advancements ====
Startups are taking advantage of the flood of new technology of the last decade to obtain Unicorn status. With the explosion of social media and access to millions utilizing this technology to gain massive economies of scale, startups have the ability to expand their business faster than ever.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; New innovations in technology including [[Smartphone|mobile smartphones]], [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] platforms, and [[cloud computing]] with the combination of social media applications has aided in the growth of unicorns.

== Valuation ==
The valuations that lead these start-up companies to become unicorns and decacorns are unique compared to more established companies. A valuation for an established company stems from past years' performances, while a start-up company's valuation is derived from its growth opportunities and its expected development in the long-term for its potential market.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/business%20functions/strategy-andcorporate-finance/our-insights/valuing-high-tech-companies|title=Valuing high-tech companies|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valuations for unicorns usually come from funding rounds of large venture capital firms investing in these start-up companies. Another significant final valuation of start-ups is when a much larger company buys out a unicorn and gives them that valuation. A recent examples of this is when [[Unilever]] bought [[Dollar Shave Club]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/19/unilever-buys-dollar-shave-club-for-1-billion/|title=Unilever Buys Dollar Shave Club for $1 Billion|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when [[Facebook]] bought [[Instagram]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303815404577333840377381670|title=Insta-Rich: $1 Billion for Instagram|last=Raice|first=Shayndi|date=2012-04-10|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-30|last2=Ante|first2=Spencer E.|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $1 billion, effectively turning Dollar Shave Club and Instagram into unicorns.

[[Bill Gurley]], a partner at [[Benchmark (venture capital firm)|Benchmark]] predicted in March 2015 and earlier that the rapid increase in the number of unicorns may "have moved into a world that is both speculative and unsustainable", that will leave in its wake what he terms "dead unicorns".&lt;ref name="WSJ_15102"&gt;{{cite news|year=2015|title=Bill Gurley Sees Silicon Valley on a Dangerous Path |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gurley-sees-silicon-valley-on-a-dangerous-path-1445911333 |work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=26 December 2015 |quote=Subtitle: Subtitle: Venture capitalist says companies hurt themselves by trying to delay going public |author=Winkler, Rolfe |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BI1017082"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Tech: How To Survive Great Depression 2.0 Without Firing Everyone|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/2008/10/benchmark-s-bill-gurley-how-to-survive-depression-without-canning-everyone?op=1|journal=Business Insider|access-date=26 December 2015|quote=It seems every serious venture capital firm has now had a chat with its portfolio companies about how it[']s time to fire people...

=== Valuation of high-growth companies ===
For high-growth companies looking for the highest valuations possible, it comes down to potential and opportunity. When investors of high-growth companies are deciding on whether they should invest in a company or not, they look for signs of a home run to make exponential returns on their investment along with the right personality that fits the company.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;MacMillan, I. C., Siegel, R., &amp; Narasimha, P. S. (1985). Criteria used by venture capitalists to evaluate new venture proposals. ''Journal of Business venturing'', ''1''(1), 119-128.&lt;/ref&gt; To give such high valuations in funding rounds, venture capital firms have to believe in the vision of both the entrepreneur and the company as a whole. They have to believe in the company can evolve from its unstable, uncertain present standing into a company that can generate and sustain moderate growth in the future.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Market sizing ====
To judge the potential future growth of a company, there needs to be an in-depth analysis of the target market.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; When a company or investor determines its market size, there are a few steps they need to consider to figure out how large the market really is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/270853|title=5 Strategies to Effectively Determine Your Market Size|last=Zhuo|first=Tx|date=2016-03-07|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Defining the sub-segment of the market (no company can target 100% market share, also known as [[monopolization]])
* Top-Down market sizing&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.b2binternational.com/publications/market-size-techniques/|title=Market Sizing: Is There A Market Size Formula? {{!}} B2B International|work=B2B International|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bottom-Up analysis&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;
* [[Competitor analysis]]
After the market is reasonably estimated, a [[financial forecast]] can be made based on the size of the market and how much a company thinks it can grow in a certain time period.

==== Estimation of finances ====
To properly judge the valuation of a company after the revenue forecast is completed, a forecast of the [[operating margin]], analysis of needed [[capital investments]], and [[Return on Invested Capital|return on invested capital]] needs to be completed to judge the growth and potential return to investors of a company.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Assumptions of where a company can grow to needs to be realistic, especially when trying to get venture capital firms to give the valuation a company wants. Venture capitalists know the payout on their investment will not be realized for another five to ten years, and they want to make sure from the start that financial forecasts are realistic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== Working back to the present ====
With the financial forecasts set, investors need to know what the company should be valued in the present day. This is where more established valuation methods become more relevant.

This includes the three most common valuation methods:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.venturevaluation.com/en/methodology/valuation-methods|title=Valuation methods {{!}} Venture Valuation|website=www.venturevaluation.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discounted cash flow|Discounted Cash Flow Analysis]]
* [[Market-based valuation|Market Comparable Method]]
* [[Comparable transactions|Comparable Transactions]]
Investors can derive a final valuation from these methods and the amount of capital they offer for a percentage of equity within a company becomes the final valuation for a startup. Competitor financials and past transactions also play an important part when providing a basis for valuing a startup and finding a correct valuation for these companies.

== Trends ==

=== Sharing economy ===
The [[sharing economy]], also known as "collaborative consumption" or "on-demand economy", is based on the concept of sharing personal resources. This trend of sharing resources has made three of the top five largest unicorns (Uber, Didi Chuxing and Airbnb) become the most valuable startups in the world. The economic downturns of recent years{{When|date=June 2017}} have powered consumers to learn to be more conservative spending and the sharing economy supports this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mnewlands/2015/07/17/the-sharing-economy-why-it-works-and-how-to-join/#441c1bfe58e1|title=The Sharing Economy: Why it Works and How to Join|last=Newlands|first=Murray|work=Forbes|date=July 17, 2015|access-date=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-commerce ===
[[E-commerce]] and the innovation of the [[online marketplace]] have been slowly taking over the needs for physical locations of store brands. A prime example of this includes the decline of malls within the United States. The sales of malls within the United States have declined from $87.46 billion in 2005 to $60.65 billion in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/trangho/2016/12/04/how-to-profit-from-the-death-of-malls-in-america/#6a5bfbd261cf|title=How To Profit From The Death Of Malls In America|last=Ho|first=Ky Trang|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of e-commerce companies like [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] (both unicorns before they went public) have decreased the need for physical locations to buy consumer goods. Many large corporations have seen this trend for a while and have tried to adapt to the e-commerce trend. [[Walmart]] recently bought [[Jet.com]], an American e-commerce company, for $3.3 billion to try and adapt to consumer preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wal-mart-to-acquire-jet-com-for-3-3-billion-in-cash-stock-1470659763|title=Wal-Mart to Acquire Jet.com for $3.3 Billion in Cash, Stock|last=Nassauer|first=Sarah|date=2016-08-08|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-31|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovative business model ===
In support of the sharing economy, unicorns and successful startups have built an operating model defined as "network orchestrators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zinnov.com/blog/rise-of-the-unicorns/|title=Rise of the Unicorns|date=2015-08-27|work=Zinnov Thoughts|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this business model, there is a network of peers creating value through interaction and sharing. Network orchestrators may sell products/services, collaborate, share reviews, and build relations through their businesses. Examples of network orchestrators include all sharing economy companies (i.e. Uber, Airbnb), companies that let consumers share information (i.e. [[TripAdvisor]], [[Yelp]]), and peer-to-peer or business-to-person selling platforms (i.e. Amazon, Alibaba).

A '''word sketch''' is a one-page, automatic, corpus-derived summary of a word’s grammatical and collocational behaviour. Word sketches were first introduced by the British corpus linguist [[Adam Kilgarriff]]&lt;ref name="macmillan"&gt;Kilgarriff, Adam; Rychlý, Pavel; Smrž, Pavel; Tugwell, David (2004) The Sketch Engine. Information Technology, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and exploited within the [[Sketch Engine]]&lt;ref&gt;Kilgarriff, Adam; Baisa, Vít; Bušta, Jan; Jakubíček, Miloš; Kovář, Vojtěch; Michelfeit, Jan; Rychlý, Pavel; Suchomel, Vít (2004) The Sketch Engine: Ten Years On. In Lexicography, page 7-36, Springer Berlin Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;
corpus management system. They are an extension of the general [[collocation]] concept used in corpus linguistics in that they group collocations according to particular grammatical relations (e.g. subject, object, modifier etc.). The collocation candidates in a word sketch are sorted either by their frequency or using a lexicographic association score like [[Sørensen–Dice coefficient|Dice]], [[T-score]] or [[MI-score]].

Since the introduction, word sketches have been used by lexicographers to develop modern corpus-based dictionaries by major publishing houses including Oxford English Dictionary,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Culpeper (2009) The metalanguage of impoliteness: Using Sketch Engine to explore the Oxford English Corpus.

== Formal account ==

A '''word sketch triple''' is a triple consisting of ''headword, grammatical relation, collocation'' (e.g. ''man, modifier, young'').
Considering an underlying [[text corpus]], a '''word sketch quintuple''' is a quintuple consisting of ''headword, grammatical relation, collocation, position of headword in the corpus, position of collocation in the corpus'' (e.g. ''man, modifier, young, 104, 103'').
A '''word sketch database''' is a set of such triples or quintuples, which may be generated either by querying a corpus using corpus query language&lt;ref&gt;Miloš Jakubíček, Adam Kilgarriff, Diana McCarthy and Pavel Rychlý (2010) Fast syntactic searching in very large corpora for many languages. In Proceedings of Workshop on Advanced Corpus Solutions, PACLIC 24, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; or by parsing the corpus using a natural language parser.&lt;ref&gt;Aleš Horák, Pavel Rychlý, Adam Kilgarriff (2009) Czech word sketch relations with full syntax parser.

'''Zemba''' (Dhimba) is a [[Bantu language]] spoken mainly in Angola where the language has about 18,000 speakers, and also in Namibia with some 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{e16|dhm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to [[Herero language|Herero]], and is often considered a dialect of that language, especially as the Zemba are [[Herero people|ethnically Herero]].

There are various spellings and pronunciations of the name: ''Zimba, Dhimba, Tjimba, Chimba,'' etc. However, when spelled ''Tjimba'' or ''Chimba'' in English, it generally refers to the [[Tjimba people]], non-Herero hunter-gatherers who speak Zemba. The spelling ''Himba'' should be distinguished from the [[Himba people]] and their dialect of Herero.

''Ethnologue'' separates Zemba as a distinct language from Himba, which according to the language map of Namibia it retains under Herero proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{e16|dhm|Zemba}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maho (2009), however, sets up a Northwest Herero language, which includes Zemba; from the map, it would appear to include Himba and [[Hakaona language|Hakaona]] as well.&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

{{Esperanto sidebar |expanded=Language}}

'''Ĉ''' or '''ĉ''' (C [[circumflex]]) is a [[consonant]] in [[Esperanto orthography]], representing the sound {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}}.

It is based on the letter ''[[c]]''. Esperanto orthography uses a [[diacritic]] for all four of its postalveolar consonants, as do the Latin-based [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] alphabets. Letters and [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s that are similar to ''ĉ'' and represent the same sound include [[Slovenian language|Slovene]] ''č,'' [[Polish language|Polish]] digraph ''cz'', [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] digraph ''ch,'' [[French language|French]] [[Digraphs and trigraphs|trigraph]] ''tch'', [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] trigraph ''tsj'', [[German language|German]] [[tetragraph]] ''tsch'', and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''c'' before ''i'' or ''e.''
