'''Albert E. Sleeper State Park''' is a public recreation area on [[Lake Huron]] in [[Lake Township, Huron County, Michigan|Lake Township]], [[Huron County, Michigan|Huron County]], [[Michigan]]. The [[state park]] encompasses {{convert|723|acre}} four miles northeast of  [[Caseville, Michigan|Caseville]], close to the tip of [[The Thumb]] of Michigan.&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt;
 
==History==
The park was created in 1925 by Huron County; it became a state park in 1927. The [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] was active in the park in the 1940s, building the park's Outdoor Center. In 1944, the park was renamed to honor former [[Governor of Michigan|Michigan Governor]] [[Albert E. Sleeper]], who signed the legislation authorizing the state park system.&lt;ref name="GMP"/&gt;
;Economic analysis
According to a 2008 economic impact analysis, Albert E. Sleeper State Park has a significant effect on the economy of the surrounding county, accounting for $5.476 million in direct spending, 144 direct jobs, and $2.881 million in [[value added]]. There is additional economic effect from [[multiplier effect|secondary effects]], totaling $7.905 million (44.9 percent over direct spending), 181 jobs (25.7 percent over direct job impacts), and $4.396 million (52.6 percent over direct value added).&lt;ref name="GMP"/&gt;

==Activities and amenities==
The park is considered a multi-use park with recreational features that include a half-mile beach on [[Saginaw Bay]], four miles of trails for hiking, biking and cross-country skiing, picnicking areas, cabins, and campground.&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt;

'''Auxetics''' are [[structure]]s or [[material science|materials]] that have a negative [[Poisson's ratio]]. When stretched, they become thicker perpendicular to the applied force. This occurs due to their particular internal structure and the way this deforms when the sample is uniaxially loaded. Auxetics can be single [[molecule]]s, crystals, or a particular structure of macroscopic matter.
Such materials and structures are expected to have mechanical properties such as high [[Shock absorber|energy absorption]] and [[fracture]] resistance. Auxetics may be useful in applications such as [[Ballistic vest|body armor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hook's law |url=https://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21567203-materials-auxetic-substances-which-get-fatter-rather-thinner-when-stretched|accessdate=1 March 2013 | work=The Economist|date=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; packing material, knee and elbow pads, robust shock absorbing material, and sponge mops.

The term ''auxetic'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word αὐξητικός (auxetikos) which means "that which tends to increase" and has its root in the word αὔξησις, or ''auxesis'', meaning "increase" (noun). This terminology was coined by Professor Ken Evans of the [[University of Exeter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Quinion | first = Michael | title = Auxetic | date = 1996-11-09 | url = http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-aux1.htm | accessdate = 2009-01-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Evans | first = Ken | title = Auxetic polymers: a new range of materials. | journal = Endeavour 15.4 | date = 1991 | pages = 170–174 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016093279190123S | accessdate = 2017-05-08 | doi=10.1016/0160-9327(91)90123-S | volume=15| issue = 4 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the first artificially produced auxetic materials, the RFS structure (diamond-fold structure) , was invented in 1978 by the Berlin researcher K. Pietsch. Although he did not use the term auxetics, he describes for the first time the underlying lever mechanism and its non-linear mechanical reaction is therefore considered the inventor of the auxetic net.
The earliest published example of a material with negative Poisson's constant is due to A. G. Kolpakov in 1985, "Determination of the average characteristics of elastic frameworks"; the next synthetic auxetic material was described in ''Science'' in 1987, entitled "[[Foam]] structures with a Negative Poisson's Ratio" &lt;ref name="Lakes"&gt;{{Citation | last = Lakes | first = R.S. | title = Foam structures with a negative Poisson's ratio | journal = Science | volume = 235 | issue = 4792 | pages = 1038–40 | date = 1987-02-27 | doi = 10.1126/science.235.4792.1038 | postscript =. | pmid = 17782252|bibcode = 1987Sci...235.1038L }}&lt;/ref&gt; by R.S. Lakes from the [[University of Wisconsin Madison]]. The use of the word ''auxetic'' to refer to this property probably began in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Evans | first = Ken| title = Auxetic polymers: a new range of materials| date = 1991 | doi=10.1016/0160-9327(91)90123-S | volume=15 | issue = 4| journal=Endeavour | pages=170–174}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Designs of composites with inverted hexagonal periodicity cell (auxetic hexagon), possessing negative Poisson ratios, were published in 1985.&lt;ref name="Kolpakov"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kolpakov | first1 = A.G. | year =1985 | title = Determination of the average characteristics of elastic frameworks | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics | volume = 49 | issue = 6| pages = 739–745 | doi=10.1016/0021-8928(85)90011-5|bibcode = 1985JApMM..49..739K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Almgren"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Almgren | first1 = R.F. | year = 1985 | title = An isotropic three-dimensional structure with Poisson's ratio=-1 | url = | journal = J.

Typically, auxetic materials have low [[density]], which is what allows the hinge-like areas of the auxetic microstructures to flex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15420854.200-a-stretch-of-the-imagination.html A stretch of the imagination - 7 June 1997 - New Scientist Space&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the macroscale, auxetic behaviour can be illustrated with an [[Inelastic collision|inelastic]] string wound around an elastic cord. When the ends of the structure are pulled apart, the inelastic string straightens while the elastic cord stretches and winds around it, increasing the structure's effective volume. Auxetic behaviour at the macroscale can also be employed for the development of products with enhanced characteristics such as footwear based on the auxetic rotating triangles structures developed by Grima and Evans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grima|first=JN|last2=Evans|first2=KE|year=2000|title=Auxetic behavior from rotating squares|journal=Journal of Materials Science Letters|volume=19|issue=17|pages=1563–1565|doi=10.1023/A:1006781224002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grima|first=JN|last2=Evans|first2=KE|year=2006|title=Auxetic behavior from rotating triangles|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume=41|issue=10|pages=3193–3196|doi=10.1007/s10853-006-6339-8|bibcode = 2006JMatS..41.3193G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nike.com/news/nike-free-2016-running-training|title=Nike Free 2016 product press release|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Birds Directive''' (formally known as '''Council Directive 2009/147/EC on the conservation of wild birds''') is a [[European Union directive]] adopted in 2009. It replaces Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds which was modified several times and had become very unclear. It aims to protect all European wild birds and the habitats of listed species, in particular through the designation of [[Special Protection Area]]s (often known by the acronym SPA).

The Birds Directive is one of the EU's two directives in relation to wildlife and nature conservation, the other being the [[Habitats Directive]]. The Habitats Directive led to the setting up of a network of [[Special Areas of Conservation]], which together with the existing Special Protection Areas form a network of protected sites across the [[European Union]] called [[Natura 2000]].

The cottage was constructed in 1755 in the English village of [[Great Ayton]], [[North Yorkshire]], by the parents of Captain [[James Cook]], James and Grace Cook,&lt;ref name="Cooks Log"&gt;[http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu4110.htm The Captain Cook Society: Cook's Log, page 212, volume 6, number 3 (1983).]&lt;/ref&gt; and was brought to Melbourne in 1934 by Sir Russell Grimwade.&lt;ref name="CityMelb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whatson.melbourne.vic.gov.au/PlacesToGo/CooksCottage/Pages/CooksCottage.aspx|title=Cooks' Cottage|publisher=[[City of Melbourne]]|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4746055 |title=CAPTAIN COOK'S COTTAGE. :ANOTHER CENTENARY GIFT.:Mr. Russell Grimwade's Generosity.|newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |issue=27,105 |location=Melbourne|date=1 July 1933 |accessdate=6 September 2017 |page=21 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a point of conjecture among historians whether James Cook, the famous navigator, ever lived in the house, but almost certainly he visited his parents at the house.&lt;ref name="Cooks Log"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article203356690 |title=CAPTAIN COOK'S COTTAGE : AN AMAZING SITUATION.|newspaper=[[The Age]] |issue=24,537 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=2 December 1933 |accessdate=6 September 2017 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}, ''...The house in which Captain Cook was born at Marton-in-Cleveland...in which he lived until...eight years old. was demolished in 1786. '''Until it was pulled down people spoke of it as Captain Cook's cottage.''' Upon the spot where it stood there stands a memorial in the form of a granite vase. It is in Stewart Park, at Marton. By a deed of gift this park was made over to the Middlebrough(sic) council, one of the conditions being "that the monument recording the site of Captain Cook's cottage should for ever be preserved and remain in situ."...''&lt;/ref&gt;

The inside of the cottage includes centuries-old antiques and is stylised in the way of the 18th century, as are the clothes of the volunteer guides.&lt;ref name="CityMelb"/&gt;

==History==
In 1933 the owner of the cottage decided to sell it with a condition of sale that the building remain in England. She was persuaded to change "England" to "the Empire", and accepted an Australian bid of £800, by [[Russell Grimwade]], as opposed to the highest local offer of £300.&lt;ref name="Cooks Log"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=McCubbin, Maryanne | title=Cooked to perfection: Cooks' Cottage and the exemplary historical figure | journal=Journal of Popular Culture | publication-date=1999-06-22 | publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=35(1) | issn=0022-3840 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cottage was deconstructed brick by brick and packed into 253 cases and 40 barrels for shipping on board the ''Port Dunedin'' from [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. Cuttings from ivy that adorned the house were also taken and planted when the house was re-erected in Melbourne. Grimwade, a notable businessman and philanthropist, donated the house to the people of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] for the centenary anniversary of the settlement of Melbourne in October 1934.&lt;ref name="Cooks Log"/&gt;

The cottage immediately became a popular tourist attraction. In 1978 further restoration work was carried out on the cottage. An English [[cottage garden]] has been established around the house, further adding to its period reconstruction. Very few of the items in the house are from the Cook family, but all are representative furnishings of the period.

==In popular culture==
The cottage features in two scenes of the 2012 movie ''[[Any Questions for Ben?]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://lightfm.com.au/topics/movie-reviews/movie-review-any-questions-for-ben/ Movie review: Any Questions For Ben?], 25 February 2012, 89.9 LightFM, ''... It is great to take note of the locations – Captain Cook's Cottage, the National Gallery of Victoria, and the Yarra River...''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Darts World Rankings''' are a system designed to determine a list of the best [[darts]] players in the world based on their performances in tournaments. However, in 1993, a group of former world champions and other high-profile players separated from the [[British Darts Organisation]], meaning there are now two major governing bodies.

Each organisation has its own players, and each has its own ranking system. The ranking systems are used to arrange [[Seed (tennis)|tournament seedings]], which are so arranged, that the number one player in the world will not face the number two player until the final of a tournament, providing they both reach that final.

==PDC World Rankings==
{{main|PDC Order of Merit}}
The [[Professional Darts Corporation]]'s Ranking is based on the amount of prize money won over the past two years.

{{PDC Order of Merit}}

==WDF World Rankings==
The rankings are based on a cumulative points system, calculated on a rolling one year basis. When a tournament is played, the previous year's results are removed from the rankings and the new tournament scores are used. This list is used to determine seeds for some of the WDF Opens. The [[World Darts Federation]] ranking system is designed to provide a measure of the global activities of darts players in every WDF recognised darts event. It used to be very similar to the BDO system but was revised in January 2007 to include categories by country and by events, and the distribution of ranking points reflect the levels of prize money on offer and the numbers of entries in a tournament. Players gain points in six different levels of categorized events and prize money and at the end of the season the leading players receive monetary bonus rewards from the [[World Darts Federation|WDF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WDF World Rankings Systems: 2013 Monetary Awards|url=http://www.dartswdf.com/2014/01/04/wdf-world-rankings-systems-2013-monetary-awards/|publisher=WDF|accessdate=12 January 2014|date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BDO Rankings==
The [[British Darts Organisation|BDO]] Invitational Table relates only to registered playing members of the BDO, who comply with BDO and World Darts Federation (WDF) eligibility rules, including terms and conditions of the 1997 [[Professional Darts Corporation#Tomlin order|Tomlin Order]].

The BDO awards points depending on a player's performances within each of its events and other BDO-recognised qualifying events. Forty-nine points are awarded to the champion of each of its three Major Events - The [[BDO World Darts Championship|Lakeside World Professional Championship]], The Bavaria [[World Darts Trophy]] and the [[Winmau World Masters]] and A+ events. Lower points are awarded for each round of the tournament reached. Other events are placed into Category A, B, C and D based on the prize-pool and number of payouts, with points for placings slowly decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook and BDO documentation: Section J - Invitation Tables Mens 2013/14 |url=http://www.bdodarts.com/uploads/files/BDO_%20Invitational%20_MEN_New.pdf.pdf |publisher=BDO |accessdate=12 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112112804/http://www.bdodarts.com/uploads/files/BDO_%20Invitational%20_MEN_New.pdf.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the best 12 placings are added for a player's ranking.

'''Ecosophy''' or '''ecophilosophy''' (a portmanteau of '''ecological philosophy''') is a philosophy of ecological harmony or equilibrium. The term was coined by the [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] father of [[deep ecology]], [[Arne Næss]], and French [[post-structuralist]] philosopher and [[psychoanalyst]] [[Félix Guattari]].

== Næss's definition ==
Naess defined ecosophy in the following way:

{{quote|By an ecosophy I mean a philosophy of ecological harmony or equilibrium. A philosophy as a kind of sofia (or) wisdom, is openly normative, it contains both norms, rules, postulates, value priority announcements and hypotheses concerning the state of affairs in our universe. Wisdom is policy wisdom, prescription, not only scientific description and prediction. The details of an ecosophy will show many variations due to significant differences concerning not only the 'facts' of pollution, resources, population, etc. but also value priorities.|A. Drengson and Y. Inoue, 1995, page 8}}

While a professor at [[University of Oslo]] in 1972, Arne Næss, introduced the terms "[[deep ecology]] movement" and "ecosophy" into environmental literature.  Naess based his article on a talk he gave in [[Bucharest]] in 1972 at the Third World Future Research Conference. As Drengson notes in ''Ecophilosophy, Ecosophy and the Deep Ecology Movement: An Overview'', "In his talk Næss discussed the longer-range background of the ecology movement and its connection with respect for Nature and the inherent worth of other beings."  Naess's view of humans as an integral part of a "total-field image&lt;ref&gt;Næss, Arne. (1972): Shallow and the Deep. Oslo: Inquiry.&lt;/ref&gt;" of Nature contrasts with the alternative (and more anthropocentric) construction of ecosophy outlined by Guattari.

The term ecological [[wisdom]], synonymous with ecosophy, was introduced by Næss in 1973.  The concept has become one of the foundations of the [[deep ecology]] movement. All expressions of values by [[Green Parties]] list '''ecological wisdom''' as a key value&amp;mdash;it was one of the original [[Green politics#Core tenets|Four Pillars of the Green Party]] and is often considered the most basic value of these parties. It is also often associated with [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[religion]] and [[culture|cultural]] practices. In its political context, it is necessarily not as easily defined as [[ecological health]] or scientific [[ecology]] concepts.

==Félix Guattari==
Ecosophy also refers to a field of practice introduced by [[psychoanalyst]], [[poststructuralist]] philosopher, and political activist [[Félix Guattari]]. In part Guattari's use of the term demarcates a necessity for the proponents of social liberation, whose struggles in the 20th century were dominated by the paradigm of social revolution, to embed their arguments within an ecological framework which understands the interconnections of social and environmental spheres.

Guattari holds that traditional environmentalist perspectives obscure the complexity of the relationship between humans and their natural environment through their maintenance of the dualistic separation of human (cultural) and nonhuman (natural) systems; he envisions ecosophy as a new field with a [[monistic]] and pluralistic approach to such study. Ecology in the Guattarian sense, then, is a study of complex phenomena, including human subjectivity, the environment, and social relations, all of which are intimately interconnected. Despite this emphasis on interconnection, throughout his individual writings and more famous collaborations with [[Gilles Deleuze]], Guattari has resisted calls for holism, preferring to emphasize heterogeneity and difference, synthesizing assemblages and [[multiplicities]] in order to trace [[rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomatic]] structures rather than creating unified and holistic structures.

{{quote|Without modifications to the social and material environment, there can be no change in mentalities. Here, we are in the presence of a circle that leads me to postulate the necessity of founding an "ecosophy" that would link environmental ecology to social ecology and to mental ecology.|Guattari 1996: 264}}

Guattari's concept of the three interacting and interdependent ecologies of mind, society, and environment stems from the outline of the three ecologies presented in ''[[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]]'', a collection of writings by [[cybernetic]]ist [[Gregory Bateson]].

This page shows the [[electron configuration]]s of the neutral gaseous atoms in their ground states. For each atom the subshells are given first in concise form, then with all subshells written out, followed by the number of electrons per shell. Electron configurations of elements beyond [[hassium]] (element 108) are predicted.
__NOTOC__
As an approximate rule, electron configurations are given by the [[Electron configuration#Atoms: Aufbau principle and Madelung rule|Aufbau principle and the Madelung rule]]. However there are numerous exceptions; for example the lightest exception is chromium, which would be predicted to have the configuration {{nowrap|1=1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 3d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; 4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, written as {{nowrap|1=[Ar] 3d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; 4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, but whose actual configuration given in the table below is {{nowrap|1=[Ar] 3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; 4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

{{Economy of Canada}}
Canada has access to all main sources of energy including [[Oil and Gas|oil and gas]], [[coal]], [[hydropower]], [[biomass]], [[Solar power|solar]], [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]], [[Wind power|wind]], [[Marine energy|marine]] and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]]. It is the world's second largest producer of [[uranium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx|title=World Nuclear Mining Production|last=|first=|date=19 May 2016|website=World Nuclear Mining|publisher=|access-date=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; third largest producer of hydro-electricity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://canadahydro.ca/facts/by-the-numbers/|title=Canadian Hydropower By the Numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Hydropower Association|publisher=|access-date=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; fourth largest natural gas producer, and the fifth largest producer of crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/files/pdf/EnergyFactBook2015-Eng_Web.pdf|title=Energy Fact Book 2015-2016|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Natural Resources Canada|publisher=|access-date=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only [[Russia]], the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[United States]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] produce more total energy than Canada.&lt;ref name="CEF_GC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Energy Facts |publisher=Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada |date=December 2006 |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/enviro/energy-energie/facts-faits.aspx?lang=eng |accessdate=2008-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520092655/http://www.international.gc.ca/enviro/energy-energie/facts-faits.aspx?lang=eng |archivedate=May 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] is Canada's major trade market for energy products and services. Canada sends around 98% of its total energy exports to the United States, meaning that Canada is the largest supplier of energy exports to the world's largest economy. Canada also exports significant amounts of uranium and coal to Asia, Europe and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canada Energy Policy Laws and Regulation Handbook|publisher=International Business Publication, USA|year=2015|isbn=9781312950481|location=Washington DC|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a net energy exporter, Canada also imports large/small amounts of energy products.&lt;ref name="CEF_GC" /&gt;

Canada has a robust energy profile with abundant and diverse resources. The energy and climate policies in Canada are interrelated. These energy and climate policies are implemented at both the federal and provincial government level. The federal government is responsible for establishing objectives for the entire country and the provincial governments are responsible for enforcing these objectives and developing the methods to achieve these goals.&lt;ref name="Fertel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fertel|first1=Camille|title=Canadian energy and climate policies: A SWOT analysis in search of federal/provincial coherence|journal=Energy Policy|date=2013|volume=63|pages=1139–1150|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.09.057}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the federal and provincial governments created a national agreement for cooperating in boosting the nation's energy industry while transitioning to a low-carbon economy.&lt;ref name="Laverty"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laverty|first1=Gene|title=Canada's Provincial leaders reach agreement on energy strategy|journal=SNL Energy Power Daily|date=Jul 20, 2015|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, provincial governments are developing their own strategies in order to reach the national goals. The Prince Edward Island Strategy is one of the first provincial strategies developed in response to the federal agreement goals.&lt;ref name="PEI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Edward Island Provincial Energy Strategy 2016/17|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory framework==
In Canada's [[federal system]] of government, jurisdiction over energy is divided between the [[Government of Canada|federal]] and [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial and territorial governments]]. Provincial governments have jurisdiction over the exploration, development, conservation, and management of [[non-renewable resources]], as well as the generation and production of [[electricity]]. Federal jurisdiction in energy is primarily concerned with regulation of inter-provincial and [[international trade]] and commerce, and the management of non-renewable resources on [[federal lands]].&lt;ref name="NRCAN"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal regulation===
The [[National Energy Board]] (NEB) is an  independent federal [[regulatory agency]] that regulates the Canadian energy industry. The NEB was created in 1959 and reports through the Minister of Natural Resources to the [[Parliament of Canada]]. Its primary responsibilities include:
* Inter-provincial and international oil and gas [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and [[power lines]],
* Export and import of natural gas under long-term licenses and short-term orders,
* Oil exports under long-term licenses and short-term orders (no applications for long-term exports have been filed in recent years), and
* [[Frontier lands]] and [[offshore drilling|offshore areas]] not covered by provincial/federal management agreements.
In 1985, the federal government and the provincial governments in [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Saskatchewan]] agreed to [[deregulate]] the prices of crude oil and natural gas. Offshore oil [[Atlantic Canada]] is administered under joint federal and provincial responsibility in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref name="NRCAN" /&gt;

===Provincial regulation===
Provincial regulation of oil and natural gas activities, pipelines, and distribution systems is administered by provincial [[Public Utilities Commission|utility boards]]. The producing provinces impose [[royalties]] and taxes on oil and natural gas production; provide drilling incentives; and grant permits and licenses to construct and operate facilities. The consuming provinces regulate distribution systems and oversee the [[retail]] [[price]] of natural gas to [[consumer]]s. The key regulations with respect to the [[wholesale]] and retail electricity competition are at the provincial level. To date, two provinces (Alberta and Ontario) have initiated [[competition (economics)|retail competition]]. In Alberta, the electricity sector is largely [[privatized]], in Ontario the process is ongoing. In other provinces electricity is mostly generated and distributed by [[crown corporations of Canada|provincially owned]] utilities.&lt;ref name="NRCAN" /&gt;

===Constitutional issues===
Canadian energy policy reflects the constitutional [[division of powers]] between the federal government and the provincial governments. The [[Constitution of Canada]] places natural resources under the [[Canadian federalism|jurisdiction of the provinces]].&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution Act, 1867'', s. 109;  s. 92(5);  s. 92A.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the three [[prairie provinces]] originally did not control the natural resources in the provinces as a condition of their entry into Confederation, until the [[Natural Resources Acts]] of 1930. The provincial governments own most of the petroleum, natural gas and coal reserves, and control most of the electricity production. This means that the national government must coordinate its energy policies with those of the provincial governments, and intergovernmental conflicts sometimes arise. The problem is particularly acute since, while the energy consuming provinces have the bulk of the population and are able to elect federal governments which introduce policies favouring energy consumers, the energy producing provinces have the ability to defeat such policies by exercising their constitutional authority over natural resources.

Section 92A of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] assigned to the provincial governments the exclusive authority to make laws in relation to non-renewable resources and electrical energy, while Section 125 prevented the federal government from taxing any provincial government lands or property. On the other hand, the federal government has the power to make treaties with foreign countries. This has important implications for treaties involving energy production, like the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which the Canadian government signed in 2002. Although the federal government had the authority to sign the treaty, it may require the cooperation of the provincial governments to enforce it.

==Energy policies==
Canada has a robust energy profile with abundant and diverse resources. Energy and climate policies are interrelated. These policies are implemented at both the federal and provincial governmental level. A recent [[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis conducted in 2013 of a Canadian energy and climate policies has shows that there is a lack of consistency between federal and regional strategies.&lt;ref name="Fertel"/&gt; The reason for this lack of consistency was attributed to the economic and environmental realities, the diversity of energy sources and energy demands that vary greatly among the Canadian provinces. As a result of the differing energy characteristics of the provinces there is creation of multiple federal and provincial strategies, sometimes complementary, but often contradictory.

The Canadian energy policy is based on three important principles. These principles are (1) competitive markets to ensure a successful and innovative energy system capable of meeting Canadian energy needs, (2) respecting the jurisdictions of provinces and the federal government and (3) targeted federal interventions in the energy trading process ensuring the specific energy-policy objectives are achieved.&lt;ref name="Laverty"/&gt;

In order to improve the coherence of provinces and federal policies a combination of policy tools have been instituted to facilitate collaboration between the federal and provincial governments. These policies tools have resulted in equal balance of federal and provincial government in the creation of energy policies. The federal government is responsible for establishing objectives for the entire country and the provincial governments are responsible for enforcing these objectives and developing the methods to achieve these goals.&lt;ref name="Laverty"/&gt;

In 2015, the federal government worked with Canada's provincial leaders and reached an agreement for cooperating in boosting the nation's industry while transitioning to a low-carbon economy.&lt;ref name="Laverty"/&gt; The critics of this agreement doubted that the provincial leaders would be to reach an agreement and they also doubted that they would be successful in forming a joint energy policy. However, this was not the case. After a three-day meeting in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Council of the Federation released this report that set out their vision for a national energy strategy.&lt;ref name="Laverty"/&gt; This agreement is meant to guide energy policy among the provincial governments. This agreement seeks out to influence provinces to promote energy efficiency and conservation, transition to lower carbon economy and enhance energy information and awareness. The Prince Edward Island Strategy is a provincial strategy that was in response to meeting the federal government goals presented in this agreement.&lt;ref name="PEI"/&gt;

==Coal==
{{See also|Coal in Canada}}

===History of coal in Canada===

Coal has been mined in Canada since 1639 when a small mine was opened at [[Grand Lake, New Brunswick]]. In 1720 French soldiers opened a mine in [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton, Nova Scotia]] to supply the fortress of [[Louisbourg]]. Cape Breton later supplied coal to [[Boston]] and other American ports. Commercial mining in New Brunswick began in 1825 although most of the province's coal production has been used locally. In [[western Canada]], coal was first mined on [[Vancouver Island]] from 1853. Starting in the 1880s, the building of the [[transcontinental railway]]s through [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]] caused coal mines to be developed in various locations near railway lines in the prairies and mountains. By 1911 western mines produced most of the coal in Canada and, despite downturns, gradually expanded to produce over 95% of Canadian coal.&lt;ref name="Page"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Coal was subsidised in Canada from 1887. The mines of Cape Breton were involved in this tariff protection to help it compete against American coal entering Ontario via the Great Lakes. Cape Breton coal was dug underground then shipped to Toronto and Montreal. The vast industries of the east, including steel mills, were fuelled with this coal. While there were difficulties and strikes, coal powered Canada into the [[Second World War]]. There were several [[Royal Commission]]s into coal: one in 1947 and other in 1965.

Federal involvement in Cape Breton, continued with the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]], or Devco which was in reality a large subsidy. The completion of the trans-Canada pipeline, nuclear reactors and the [[Hibernia oil field]]s have finished coal in [[Nova Scotia]]. On the other side of the country, Vancouver Island is covered in coal: there are coal fields in Cassidy, [[Nanaimo]], [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]] and Fort Rupert.  Coal was mined at Nanaimo for one hundred years from 1853 to 1955. Coal was fed in ship's furnaces, railroad engines, and industry. In BC's interior coal was mined at [[Merritt, British Columbia|Merritt]], [[Coalmont, British Columbia|Coalmont]], [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]] and [[Hudson's Hope, British Columbia|Hudson's Hope]].  The development of coal mines in the west is integrally mixed with the building of railways—the Canadian Pacific Railway was directly involved with the Fermie mines. A separate railway—the Crow's Nest Line—was built to move coal from the Rockies to the smelter at Trail.  Alberta's bedrock is literally a layer of coal—coal underlays much of the Rocky Mountains. Historically, there were underground pits in [[Lethbridge]], [[Pincher Creek]], Canmore and [[Nordegg, Alberta|Nordegg]].

The discovery of huge oil fields in western Canada starting with the [[Leduc, Alberta]] field in 1947, and growing imports of cheap foreign oil into eastern Canada drastically affected the demand for Canadian coal. Beginning about 1950, almost all the coal used for heating, industry, and transportation was replaced by petroleum products and natural gas. This had a devastating effect on the coal mining communities of Atlantic Canada, although in western Canada the loss of jobs in the coal industry was more than compensated for by gains in the oil industry.

Coal mining began an expansion phase in the late 1960s with the signing of long-term contracts to supply metallurgical coal to the booming Japanese steel industry. This was of little benefit to Atlantic Canada, but led to the re-opening of closed mines and the development of new mines in Alberta and BC. Around the same time, Alberta and Saskatchewan began to use their substantial coal resources to generate electricity. Crude oil price increases in the 1970s and early 1980s increased the demand for coal worldwide. New mines opened in Alberta and BC, and new port facilities were built in BC to supply the growing demand in Asia.&lt;ref name="Page" /&gt;

===Coal in modern day Canada===
Canada has the tenth largest coal reserves in the world, an enormous amount considering the sparse population of the country. However, the vast majority of those reserves are located hundreds or thousands of kilometres from the country's industrial centers and seaports, and the effect of high transportation costs is that they remain largely unexploited. As with other natural resources, regulation of coal production is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial governments, and it only enters federal jurisdiction when it is imported or exported from Canada.

Over 90% of Canada's coal reserves and 99% of its production are located in the Western provinces of [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], and [[Saskatchewan]]. Alberta has 70% of Canada's coal reserves, and 48% of the province is underlaid by coal deposits. The Hat Creek deposit in British Columbia has one of the thickest coal deposits in the world, about {{convert|550|m|ft}} thick. There are also smaller, but substantial, coal deposits in the [[Yukon]] and [[Northwest Territories]] and the [[Canadian Arctic islands|Arctic Islands]], which are even further from markets. The [[Atlantic provinces]] of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] have coal deposits that were historically a very important source of energy, and Nova Scotia was once the largest coal producer in Canada, but these deposits are much smaller and much more expensive to produce than the Western coal, so coal production in the Atlantic provinces has virtually ceased. Nova Scotia now imports most of the coal for its steel mills and power plants from other countries like Colombia. At the same time, the Western provinces export their coal to 20 different countries, particularly [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[China]], in addition to using it in their own thermal power plants. Elk Valley Coal mine is the second biggest coal mine in the world.

The region between New Brunswick and Saskatchewan, a distance of thousands of kilometres which includes the major industrial centers of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], is largely devoid of coal. As a result, these provinces import almost all of the coal for their steel mills and thermal power plants from the United States. Unfortunately coal from the Eastern United States is high in sulfur content, and this had contributed to a serious air quality problem, particularly in heavily populated Southwestern Ontario until they phased out the last coal fired power plant in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. David McKeown|publisher=City of Toronto|date=March 2005|title=Curbing Transboundary Air Pollution: Protecting Health Through Legal Action|url=http://www.toronto.ca/health/hphe/pdf/boh_curbing_transboundary_air_pollution_full.pdf|accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Alberta the coal fired [[Sundance Power Station]] and [[Genesee Generating Station]] are the second and third largest sources of greenhouse gases in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps-cartes.ec.gc.ca/indicators-indicateurs/TableView.aspx?ID=1&amp;lang=en|title=Error - Erreur|author=|date=|website=maps-cartes.ec.gc.ca|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petroleum==
{{Main|History of the petroleum industry in Canada|History of the petroleum industry in Canada (frontier exploration and development)|History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)}}

===First fields===
In 1858 James Miller Williams dug the first oil well in North America at Oil Springs, Ontario, preceding Edwin Drake who drilled the first one in the United States one year later. By 1870 Canada had 100 refineries in operation and was exporting oil to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petroleumhistory.ca/history/cdnbeginnings.html] Petroleum History Society - Canadian Beginnings&lt;/ref&gt; However, the oil fields of Ontario were shallow and small, and oil production peaked and started to decline around 1900. In contrast, oil production in the United States grew rapidly in the first part of the 20th century after huge discoveries were made in Texas, Oklahoma, California and elsewhere.

===Turner Valley era===
In 1914, [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada, part one#Turner Valley|Turner Valley]] became the first significant field found in Alberta. Eastern Canadian investors and the federal government showed little interest and the field was developed primarily by subsidiaries of U.S. companies. It was originally believed to be a gas field with a small amount of [[naptha]] condensed in the gas, but due to the lack of regulations, about 90% of the gas was [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada, part one#Waste and conservation|flared off]] to extract the small amount of petroleum liquids, an amount of gas that today would be worth billions of dollars.

In 1930, crude oil was discovered in the Turner Valley field, below and to the west of the gas cap. This came as a shock to geologists because the free gas cap, which could have provided the reservoir drive to produce the oil, had largely been produced and flared off by that time. As a result, less than 12% of the original oil in place at Turner Valley will ever be recovered.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alberta provincial government became upset by the conspicuous waste so in 1931 it passed the Oil and Gas Wells Act, followed in 1932 by the Turner Valley Conservation Act. However, the federal government declared both Acts unconstitutional, and the wasteful burning of natural gas continued. However, in 1938 the provincial government established the Alberta Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board (today known as the [[Energy Resources Conservation Board]]) to initiate conservation measures, and this time was successful in implementing it.&lt;ref&gt;

This body was the regulator of oil and gas production in Alberta, and therefore of most production in Canada. As the provincial regulatory authority with the most experience in the industry, it became a model for the other oil and gas producing provinces - indeed, it has been used as a model by many national petroleum industries around the world.

===Post-war discoveries and development===
At the end of World War II, Canada was importing 90% of its oil from the U.S. The situation changed dramatically in 1947 when, after drilling 133 consecutive dry holes, [[Imperial Oil]] decided to drill into a peculiar anomaly on its newly developed [[seismic]] recordings near the then-village of [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]] to see what it was. The [[Leduc No. 1]] well identified a [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada, part one#Leduc|large oil field]], and provided the geological key for other important discoveries within Alberta. Geologists soon began to identify and drill other [[Devonian]] [[reef]]s within the province - mostly in the north-central portion of the province. The Alberta oil rush began, and drillers quickly began to identify other important oil-bearing formations like the one hosting the giant Pembina oilfield.

The Leduc discovery and the string of even bigger ones that followed rapidly backed imported oil out of the Canadian prairies and produced a huge surplus of oil which had no immediate market. In 1949, Imperial Oil applied to the federal government to build the [[Enbridge|Interprovincial Pipeline]] (IPL) to [[Lake Superior]], and in 1950 it was completed to the port of [[Superior, Wisconsin]]. Many people questioned why it was built to an American port rather than a Canadian one, but the federal government was more interested in the fact that oil exports made a huge difference to Canada's trade balance and completely erased the country's balance of trade deficit.

By 1956 the pipeline was extended via [[Sarnia]], [[Ontario]] to [[Toronto]] and became, at 3,100&amp;nbsp;km, the longest oil pipeline in the world. In the interest of increasing oil exports, extensions were built to [[Chicago]] and other refinery locations in the [[Midwestern United States]] during the 1960s. In the other direction, in 1950 the federal government gave approval to build a pipeline west, and in 1953 the 1,200&amp;nbsp;km [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada#Crude oil arteries|Transmountain Pipeline]] was built from Edmonton to the port of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] with an extension to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. These pipelines did more to improve the energy security of the United States than that of Canada, since the Canadian government was more interested in the country's [[trade balance]] than in military or energy security.

===National Oil Policy (1964)===
[[File:Oilrig-AB-north.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Drilling rig in northern [[Alberta]]]]
After the big discoveries of the 1940s and 1950s, the U.S. noticed that Alberta was protected from invasion by the wall of the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west, the vast [[boreal forest]] to the north, and the bottomless swamps of the [[Canadian shield]] to the east, but was highly accessible from the vast industrial areas of the U.S. Midwest to the south. Its landlocked location was easier to defend from foreign attack than the United States own oil fields in Texas, Alaska and California. As a result, the U.S. gave preference to oil imports from Canada, and for the purposes of energy policy treated Alberta as if it were a U.S. state. Since this resulted in producers in Alberta receiving better treatment from the United States government than the Canadian government, producers asked the federal government for access to the Eastern Canadian oil market. Oil producers in Alberta calculated they could deliver Alberta oil to the refineries at Montreal for a cost equal to or only slightly higher than the price of imported oil.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} However, the Montreal area refineries and the Quebec government balked at the restriction, so the result was the National Oil Policy of 1961. This drew a dividing line at the Ottawa River and gave Canadian producers exclusive rights to the areas to sell oil to the west of the line. Refineries to the east of the line could continue to process imported oil.

Not everyone was happy with the arrangement.  The aim of the National Oil Policy was to promote the Alberta oil industry by securing for it a protected share of the domestic market. Under the policy, Canada was divided into two oil markets. The market east of the Ottawa Valley (the Borden Line) would use imported oil, while west of the Borden Line, consumers would use the more expensive Alberta supplies. For most of the 1961-73 period, consumers to the West paid between $1.00 and $1.50 per barrel above the world price, which, just before the 1973 OPEC oil embargo and price increase, stood at around $3.00. They also paid proportionately higher prices at the pump than Canadians east of the Borden line.

===Government energy companies===
In 1970, Quebec created a provincially owned petroleum company called SOQUIP. A year later, the [[Gordon Commission]]'s nationalist flavour found practical expression with the creation of the [[Canada Development Corporation]], to "buy back" Canadian industries and resource with deals that included a takeover of the Western operations of France's Aquitaine and their conversion into Canterra Energy. Also in 1971, the federal government blocked a proposed purchase of Canadian-controlled Home Oil by American-based Ashland Oil.

The wave of direct action spread to Alberta when Premier [[Peter Lougheed]] and his Conservatives won power in 1971, ending 36 years of [[Social Credit]] rule. Lougheed's elaborate election platform, titled New Directions, sounded themes common among OPEC countries by pledging to create provincial resources and oil growth companies, collect a greater share of energy revenues, and foster economic diversification to prepare for the day when petroleum reserves ran out. The idea of limited resources emerged from the realm of theory into hard facts of policy when the NEB rejected natural-gas export applications in 1970 and 1971, on grounds that there was no surplus and Canada needed the supplies. The strength of the new conservationist sentiment was underlined when the NEB stuck to its guns despite a 1971 declaration by the federal Department of Energy that it thought Canada had a 392-year supply of [[natural gas]] and enough oil for 923 years.

===Energy crises (1973 and 1979)===
In 1973, this situation changed abruptly.

The Canadian government had already begun to change its energy policy. Inflation had become a national problem and oil prices were rising, and on September 4, 1973 Pierre Trudeau asked the western provinces to agree to a voluntary freeze on oil prices. Nine days later, his government imposed a 40-cent tax on every barrel of exported Canadian oil. The tax equalled the difference between domestic and international oil prices, and the revenues were used to subsidize imports for eastern refiners. At a stroke, Ottawa began subsidizing eastern consumers while reducing the revenues available to producing provinces and the petroleum industry. Alberta premier Peter Lougheed soon announced that his government would revise its royalty policy in favour of a system linked to international oil prices.

Two days later, on October 6, the Yom Kippur War broke out – a nail-biting affair between Israel and the Arab states. OPEC used the conflict to double the posted price for a barrel of Saudi Arabian light oil, to US$5.14. Saudi and the other Arab states then imposed embargoes on countries supporting Israel, and oil prices rose quickly to $12.

These events aggravated tensions among provincial, federal and industry leaders. The rest of the 1970s were marked by rapid-fire, escalating moves and counter-moves by Ottawa, Western provinces and even Newfoundland. The atmosphere was one of urgency, alarm and crisis, with global conflicts adding gravity to the federal-provincial quarrelling.

In 1979-1980, further crises in the Middle East led to panic-driven pricing. The [[Iranian Revolution]] came first. War between that country and Iraq soon followed. Oil prices more than doubled, to US$36 per barrel.

===National Energy Program (1980-1985)===
{{Main|National Energy Program}}
Introduced by the Liberal government under [[Pierre Trudeau]] on October 28, 1980, the controversial [[National Energy Program]] (NEP) had three objectives: energy self-sufficiency; redistributing wealth from a non-sustainable resource to benefit the country as a whole; and increased ownership of the oil industry by Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/national-energy-program 
|title=National Energy Program  
|first=François 
|last=Bregha 
|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia 
|year=2012
|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As implemented, the NEP gave the Federal government control over petroleum prices, imposing a price ceiling and export duties.

The federal government had two major challenges in creating a truly national energy program. The first problem was that Canada is both an importer and an exporter of oil. It imports oil from offshore sources such as Venezuela and the Middle East into its Eastern provinces, while simultaneously exporting oil from its Western provinces into the United States. While it was popular in Eastern and Central Canada, the program incurred strong resentment in the province of Alberta &lt;ref&gt;http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/pub/cpp/June1990/James.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; where oil and gas production are concentrated. The second problem was that provincial governments, rather than the federal government, have constitutional jurisdiction over natural resources. The Government of Alberta actually owned most of the oil in Canada. This provoked a confrontation with the government of Alberta, since any reduction in oil prices came directly out of Alberta government revenues. The conflict was made worse by the fact that the Alberta government had constitutional mechanisms available to it by which it could remove oil from federal taxation and shift the costs of oil subsidies onto the federal government. This increased the federal government deficit.

The National Energy Program had a number of other flaws. It was based on a world price steadily increasing to $100 per barrel. The world oil price declined to as little as $10 per barrel in the years following. Since the federal government based its spending on the larger figure, the result was that it spent a great deal of money on subsidies that could not be recovered in taxes on production. Furthermore, due to proximity to the U.S. market companies had opportunities to make money by playing differentials in prices. For instance, refiners in Eastern Canada would import oil subsidized down to half the world price, refine it into products, and export the products to the U.S. at full world price. Airlines flying between Europe and the U.S. via the polar route would take off with as little fuel as possible, and stop briefly in Canada to fill up before continuing on to their destination. Trucking companies operating between locations in the Northern U.S. would detour their trucks through Canada to refuel. None of these transactions was illegal, or even unusual considering the integrated nature of the economies, but all had the effect of transferring billions of Canadian tax dollars to the balance sheets of (mostly foreign owned) companies. A third flaw was that the NEP assumed that future oil discoveries would be made in areas under federal jurisdiction, such as the Arctic and offshore. As it turned out, most of the major oil discoveries in Canada had already been made, and the subsidies given by the federal government to companies exploring in federal jurisdiction were not productive. All of these flaws resulted in large, and unexpected, increases in the federal budget deficit.

The final result of the NEP was that the federal government failed to keep fuel prices low while incurring financial losses. In the subsequent election in 1984, the governing Liberal party was defeated. The winning Progressive Conservative party dismantled the policy two and a half years after its election.

===Petro-Canada===
{{Main|Petro-Canada}}
In 1975 the Liberal government reacted to the 1973 oil crisis by creating a federally owned oil company, [[Petro-Canada]]. The [[Crown corporation]] was originally developed to be an "eye on the petroleum industry" during a period of perceived [[1973 energy crisis|energy crisis]]. Initially, its assets consisted only of the federal government's share of the oil sands company [[Syncrude]] and the Arctic oil explorer [[Panarctic oils|Panarctic Oils]].

However, the government quickly expanded it by buying the Canadian assets of foreign-owned oil companies, such as [[Atlantic Richfield]] in 1976, [[Phillips Petroleum Company|Pacific Petroleums]] in 1979, [[Petrofina]] in 1981, the refining and marketing assets of [[BP]] in 1983 and of [[Gulf Oil]] in 1985.

Federal ownership brought Petro-Canada into conflict with the provincial governments which had control over the largest and lowest cost oil production in the country. They objected to federal intrusion into their constitutional jurisdiction, and tried to block federal incursions. For instance, when Petro-Canada attempted to buy [[Husky Energy|Husky Oil]] in 1978, the Alberta government surreptitiously got control of Husky stock through [[Nova Chemicals|Alberta Gas Trunk Line]], and successfully blocked the takeover. In 1979 Petro-Canada acquired [[Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd.]] and Pacific Petroleums Ltd., its parent company, as a fully integrated oil company for the then-record purchase price of $1.5 billion.

Petro-Canada overestimated the future price of oil, and consequently paid high prices for the oil assets it acquired, which subsequently fell considerably in value. Its assumption that big new oil discoveries would be made in the Arctic and off the Atlantic coast turned out to be incorrect. Petro-Canada has since abandoned all the wells Panarctic drilled, and the discoveries it did make off the Atlantic coast were fewer, more expensive, and took longer to develop than expected. [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia]] did not produce oil until 1997 and [[Terra Nova (oil field)|Terra Nova]] until 2002. The government also expected Petro-Canada to force down what it considered the high price of gasoline to consumers, but Petro-Canada's oil production was more expensive and its oil refineries less efficient than those of the competing multi-national companies, and it found itself losing money on all aspects of the oil industry.

When the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] replaced the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] in power in 1984, they began to reverse the nationalization process. In 1991, they passed legislation allowing privatization and began selling shares to the public. The Liberals returned to power in 1993, but had lost interest in having a [[national oil company]], and continued the privatization process. In 1995 the federal government reduced its interest to 20 percent, and in 2004 sold the remaining shares. Petro-Canada has done better since privatization because [[oil price increases since 2003]] make its high-cost production profitable, and consolidation of its refining operations to fewer but larger refineries reduced its downstream costs even as prices increased.

On March 23, 2009, Petro-Canada and [[Suncor Energy]] announced they would merge to create Canada's largest oil company. At the time of the announcement, combined [[market capitalization]] of the two corporations was $43 billion. The merged organization would operate under the Suncor name, but would use the Petro-Canada brand in its retail operations. The companies estimated that the merger would save $1.3 billion per year in capital and operating costs, and said that the larger company will have the financial resources to move ahead with the most promising oilsands projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Suncor, Petro-Canada announce merger | publisher = [[CBC News]] | date = March 23, 2009 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/03/23/suncor-petro-canada-merge.html | accessdate = 2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-conventional oil==

&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, {{convert|175|Goilbbl|m3}} are extractable at current prices using current technology, which makes Canada's proven oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia. Production costs are considerably higher than in the [[Middle East]], but this is offset by the fact that the geological and political risks are much lower than in most major oil-producing areas. Almost all of the Canadian oil sands are located in Alberta. The [[Athabasca oil sands]] are the only major oil sands deposits in the world which are shallow enough for surface mining.

Commercial production began in 1967 when Great Canadian Oil Sands (now [[Suncor]]) launched the world's first major oil sands mine. [[Syncrude]] opened the second major facility in 1978. The third, by [[Shell Canada]], started in 2003. The oil price increases of 2004-2007 made the oil sands much more profitable, and by 2007 over $100 billion worth of new mines and thermal projects were under construction or on the drawing boards. [[Royal Dutch Shell]] announced that in 2006 its Canadian oil sands operations were almost twice as profitable on a per-barrel basis as its international conventional oil operations and in July 2007, it announced it would start a massive $27 billion expansion of its oil sands plants in Alberta.

Cost of production in the oil sands, from raw tar sand to fractionate in the pipe feed, was $18 per barrel; now with improvements it is in the 12-15 dollar range. Rapid price increases in recent years have greatly contributed to the profitability of an industry which has traditionally focused on reducing operating costs, and continues to do so. Environmental economists point out that the focus on operating costs does not sufficiently address environmental issues - for example, "ravaged landscapes, despoiled rivers, diseased denizens, and altered atmospheric chemistry."

Oil sands operations differ from conventional oil in that the initial profitability is somewhat lower, but the geological and political risks are low, the reserves are vast, and the expected lifetime of production extends for generations rather than just a few years. Governments have an incentive to subsidize the start-up costs since they will recover their initial subsidies from tax revenues over a long period of time. From the standpoint of federal-provincial revenues, they also differ in that the federal government will receive larger higher share and higher return on its incentives than it would from conventional oil, while the provincial share, although substantial, will be proportionally smaller. Consequently, there has tended to be much less intergovernmental conflict and more agreement on how these projects should be handled.

If global oil prices remain high, it is likely that Canada will become one of the largest oil producers in the world in the next few decades. If so, there will be environmental issues, resulting more from the vast scale of the operations rather than the toxicity of the products. The oil sands deposits are roughly the size of Florida and the operations would drastically alter the landscape, which until recently was largely wilderness. In addition, concerns have been raised about water supplies, since the mines and steam projects would use a large portion of the flow of several major rivers. The most serious problem in the short term is an acute labor and housing shortage which has driven vacancy rates in the oil sands area to zero and wages to extremely high levels. However, given the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue expected to be generated by the oil sands in the next few decades, it is likely that future projects will be approved regardless of the problems.

Also 19 deposits of [[oil shale]]s have been identified in Canada. The most explored deposits are in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]. These are not as large as those in the Western United States, and will probably remain undeveloped in the foreseeable future since they are much more expensive and much smaller than the oil sands.

==Natural gas==
{{Main|History of the petroleum industry in Canada|History of the petroleum industry in Canada (natural gas)|History of the petroleum industry in Canada (natural gas liquids)}}

===Alberta Natural Gas===
The natural gas industry is older in Alberta than oil, dating from 1883 discoveries near Medicine Hat. During the first half of the twentieth century, those who applied for permits to export Alberta natural gas often made the painful discovery that it was politically more complex to export gas than oil. Canadians tend to view oil as a commodity. However, through much of Canadian history, they have viewed natural gas as a patrimony, an essential resource to husband with great care for tomorrow. Although the reasons behind this attitude are complex, they are probably rooted in its value for [[space heating]]. This trend goes back as far as an incident at the end of the nineteenth century, when [[Ontario]] revoked export licenses for natural gas to the United States.

By the late 1940s Alberta, through its Conservation Board, eliminated most of the wasteful production practices associated with the Turner Valley oil and gas field. As new natural gas discoveries greeted drillers in the Leduc-fuelled search for oil, the industry agitated for licenses to export natural gas. In response, the provincial government appointed the Dinning Natural Gas Commission to inquire into Alberta's likely reserves and future demand.

In its March 1949 report, the Dinning Commission supported the principle that Albertans should have first call on provincial natural gas supplies, and that Canadians should have priority over foreign users if an exportable surplus developed. Alberta accepted the recommendations of the Dinning Commission, and later declared it would only authorize exports of gas in excess of a 30-year supply. Shortly thereafter, Alberta's Legislature passed the Gas Resources Conservation Act, which gave Alberta greater control over natural gas at the wellhead, and empowered the Oil and Gas Conservation Board to issue export permits.

The federal government's policy objectives at the time reflected concern for national integration and equity among Canadians. In 1949, Ottawa created a framework for regulating interprovincial and international pipelines with its Pipe Lines Act. Alberta once again agreed to authorize exports. The federal government, like Alberta, treated natural gas as a Canadian resource to protect for the foreseeable future before permitting international sales.

Although Americans were interested in Canadian exports, they only wanted very cheap natural gas. After all, their natural gas industry was a major player in the American economy, and American policy-makers were not eager to allow foreign competition unless there was clear economic benefit.

Because of these combined factors, proposals for [[history of the petroleum industry in Canada#Gas pipelines and politics|major gas transportation projects]] carried political as well as economic risks. Not until the implementation of the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] (signed in 1988) did natural gas become a freely traded commodity between the US and Canada.

In 2016 as well as being Canada's largest producer, Alberta consumed more natural gas than any other province at 3.9 billion cubic feet per day.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/ntgrtd/mrkt/nrgsstmprfls/cda-eng.html&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the high consumption is due to generating 40% of the provinces electricity using gas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/ntgrtd/mrkt/nrgsstmprfls/ab-eng.html?=undefined&amp;wbdisable=true&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Electricity sector in Canada}}

===Early history===
The use of electricity in Canada began with a few trial installations of electric arc lights in [[Montreal]] and [[Toronto]] in 1878 and 1879. A permanent arc lighting system was installed in Toronto in 1881 and used to illuminate a number of stores, including [[Eaton's]]. In [[Ottawa]], arc lights were installed in several mills. By 1883 arc lights were installed in the streets of Toronto, Montreal and [[Winnipeg]], and by 1890 numerous cities from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] to [[Victoria, British Columbia]] had arc lighting.

The first successful installations of [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[incandescent light]]ing systems began in  Ontario and Quebec starting in 1882. In 1886 a small plant supplying incandescent lights was installed in the [[Parliament Hill|Parliament Buildings]] in Ottawa. These [[direct current]] (DC) systems could serve only a radius of {{convert|800|m|ft}} from the power plant. However, in 1888 the first permanent installation of a [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] [[alternating current]] (AC) system was installed in [[Cornwall, Ontario]].

The competition between AC and DC came to a head during the development of the potential of [[Niagara Falls]] because AC systems could supply electricity over much longer distances than DC systems. This was enormously important to Canada, which had numerous potential [[hydroelectric]] sites in remote locations. In 1897 a transmission system was built from the [[Batiscan River]] {{convert|16|mi|km}} to [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Quebec]]. In 1901 [[Shawinigan Falls]] was harnessed, and by 1903 a 50,000 volt power line carried electricity from it to Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development in Ontario===
{{See also|Ontario electricity policy}}
In 1906, influenced by [[Adam Beck]], the [[Ontario]] Legislature created the [[Ontario Hydro|Hydro-Electric Power Commission]] (HEPC) to build transmissions lines to supply municipal utilities with power generated at Niagara Falls by  private companies. In 1910 the HEPC began building 110,000 volt electric power lines to supply electricity to numerous municipalities in southwestern Ontario. In 1922 it started building its own generating stations, and gradually it took over most power generation in Ontario. In 1926 it signed long-term contracts to buy electricity from power companies in Quebec, but these proved controversial when jurisdictional disputes impeded development of the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] and [[Ottawa River]]s and the [[Great Depression]] reduced demand. However, during [[World War II]] they proved an extremely important source of power for war production.

After WWII, the development of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] in conjunction with American power authorities allowed the development of the potential of the St. Lawrence River, and agreements with Quebec allowed Ontario to develop sites on the upper Ottawa River. However, hydroelectric capacity in Ontario was inadequate to meet growing demand, so coal burning power stations were built near [[Toronto]] and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] in the early 1950s. In the 1960s, Ontario turned to [[nuclear power]]. In 1962 the HEPC and [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] started operating a 25-megawatt [[Nuclear Power Demonstrator]], and in 1968 they brought the 200-megawatt [[Douglas Point Nuclear Generating Station]] into service. This was followed by the [[Pickering Nuclear Generating Station]] in 1971, the [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]] in 1977, and the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]] in 1989. In 1974, toward the beginning of this expansion, the HEPC was renamed [[Ontario Hydro]], which had long been its informal name.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Pickering grew to eight 540 MW nuclear reactors, Bruce to eight 900+ MW reactors, and Darlington to four 935 MW units.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the enormous debt from building nuclear power stations, combined with lower than expected reliability and life span, became a political issue. The Ontario government decided to open the market to competition. In the meantime, the closure of many of Ontario's nuclear reactors for rehabilitation, combined with increasing demand resulted in a substantial increase in coal-fired power generation, with resulting increases in air pollution levels. In 2003 a new government came into power in Ontario and pledged to phase out coal as a generation source, leaving open the question of how Ontario was to meet future demand.

===Development in Quebec===
[[File:Barrage Daniel-Johnson2.jpg|thumb|300px|The Daniel-Johnson Dam, on the [[Manicouagan River]], was named after [[Daniel Johnson, Sr.]], the Quebec premier who died at the site, on September 26, 1968.]]
{{See also|Hydro-Québec|Hydro-Québec's electricity transmission system}}
The [[Quebec]] government followed the example of Ontario in nationalizing its electrical sector, and in 1944 [[expropriate]]d the assets of the monopoly ''Montreal Light, Heat and Power Company'' to create a new [[crown corporation]] called [[Hydro-Québec]]. In the post-war era, Hydro-Québec set about expanding and improving the reliability of the electric power grid, and demonstrated it could transmit electricity over long distances at extremely high voltages. Under [[Maurice Duplessis]] the Quebec government preferred to leave electrification of rural areas to the Rural Electrification Agency., however after [[Jean Lesage]] took power in 1960, Hydro-Québec gained exclusive rights to develop new hydroelectric projects, and in 1963 it began the gradual takeover of all private distributors in the province. Driven by rapidly growing demand, Hydro-Québec built three major hydroelectric complexes in rapid succession: [[Manicouagan Reservoir|Manicouagan-Outardes]] on the [[Côte-Nord|North Shore]] of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], and the [[James Bay Project]] on [[La Grande River]]. This, combined with lower than projected demand, created a surplus of electricity in Quebec, so in 1997, Hydro-Québec began wholesale marketing of electricity to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

===Development in British Columbia===
{{See also| BC Hydro}}
The development of electric power in [[British Columbia]] began with the installation of electric lights in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] in 1883. Created in 1897, the BC Electric Company built BC's first hydroelectric plant near Victoria the following year, and created subsidiaries to supply electricity to Victoria and [[Vancouver]], the province's two largest cities. BC Electric was taken over by Montreal-based [[Power Corporation]] in 1928. Before and during World War II, BC Electric primarily supplied power to the main cities of Vancouver and Victoria, leaving other regions with spotty and unreliable supply. In 1938, the BC government created the [[British Columbia Utilities Commission]], which limited BC Electric's profit margins. In 1945, the provincial government created a [[crown corporation]], the BC Power Commission (BCPC), to acquire small utilities and extended electrification to rural and isolated areas. BCPC grew to supply more than 200 small communities throughout the province.

The American and Canadian governments signed the [[Columbia River Treaty]] in 1961 and ratified it in 1964, agreeing to share power from [[hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River]]. To enable development of major hydroelectric sites on the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]]s, the BC government under Premier [[W. A. C. Bennett]] bought BC Electric in 1961, and the following year merged it with the BCPC to create the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, commonly known as [[BC Hydro]]. During the 60s and 70s, BC Hydro built some of the largest hydroelectric projects in the world, notably the [[W. A. C. Bennett Dam]]. More than 80% of BC Hydro's electricity is produced by 61 dams at 43 locations on the Columbia and Peace Rivers. Since that time the company's developments have been much smaller. During the 1980s BC Hydro changed its focus from building new hydroelectric plants to promoting energy conservation.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2010 the province enacted the Clean Energy Act which puts it on a path toward electricity self-sufficiency and energy conservation, while opening the door to energy exports, further investments in clean, renewable energy and a requirement that 93 percent of its electricity must come from clean or renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New Act Powers B.C.

===Development in Alberta===
With its earliest beginnings in the 1890s, Alberta's electricity system evolved as combination of a municipally and privately owned and operated systems based on coal-fired generation supplemented with some hydro. Most major municipalities operated municipally owned distribution systems.

Beginning as early as 1887, Alberta had numerous small, privately owned firms that supplied towns across the province with electricity. However, service was often inconsistent—limited to a select number of businesses and provided only for a few evening hours.

As of 2008, Alberta's electricity sector was the most [[emission intensity|carbon-intensive]] of all Canadian provinces and territories, with total emissions of 55.9 million tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{chem|CO|2}} equivalent]] in 2008, accounting for 47% of all Canadian emissions in the electricity and heat generation sector.&lt;ref name="GHG2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Environment Canada|publisher=[[UNFCCC]]|title=National Inventory Report Greenhouse Gas Sources and Sinks in Canada 1990–2008 (3 volumes)|url=http://unfccc.int/national_reports/annex_i_ghg_inventories/national_inventories_submissions/items/8812.php |date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Calgary Power====
Calgary Power's first major project became the construction of the province's first large-scale hydroelectric plant, located at the Horseshoe Falls. The Horseshoe Falls Plant's opening on May 21, 1911, allowed Calgary Power to meet the needs of the city. According to the Morning Albertan, Calgary mayor J. W. Mitchell was aroused from a Sunday nap to flip the switch which officially opened the plant and connected the city with its first large-scale source of electricity. In 1911, Calgary Power supplied 3,000 horsepower of electricity to the city at a cost of $30 per horsepower. The city had 44,000 people in 1911, and the emerging need for mass transportation was met by the booming streetcar industry, which accounted for a significant share of the city's electric usage. By 1913, Calgary Power had constructed the Kananaskis Falls Plant as an additional source of power.

In 1947, two years after the war ended, Calgary Power moved its head office from Montreal—then the nation's largest city and prime business center—to Calgary, reorganized, and incorporated as Calgary Power Ltd. At that time, Calgary Power supplied the province of Alberta with 99 percent of its hydroelectric power. Also in 1947, Calgary Power built its Barrier Hydro Plant and used it to test the use of a newly developed remote-control operation system. The automation efforts worked well enough that Calgary Power soon converted all of its plants to the Barrier Plant system. A control center that could operate the company's entire system was built in Seebe in 1951.

Calgary Power continued to expand through the 1950s and 1960s, developing its first underground distribution lines and building dams on the Brazeau and North Saskatchewan rivers. The reservoir built on the North Saskatchewan project, Lake Abraham, became the largest man-made lake in the province. Also at this time, Calgary Power began exploring thermal energy generation, since few sites remained that were suitable for hydro power development. The company built its first thermal generating plant in 1956 near Wabamun Lake, west of Edmonton and near large coal reserves.

====Alberta Power====
On July 19, 1911, Canadian Western Natural Gas, Light, Heat, and Power Company Limited was incorporated to provide natural gas from near Medicine Hat to other communities in southern Alberta. Electricity was also provided.

In 1954, International Utilities became the corporate owner of Canadian, Northwestern and Canadian Western Utilities. Canadian Utilities purchased the McMurray Light and Power Company Limited and Slave Lake Utilities. Northland Utilities Limited was added in 1961. In the early 1970s, Canadian Utilities became the corporate parent of Canadian Western, Northwestern, Northland, and Alberta Power Limited, which was the electrical operations of Canadian Utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Canadian-Utilities-Limited-Company-History.html|title=History of Canadian Utilities Limited – FundingUniverse|author=|date=|website=www.fundinguniverse.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edmonton Power====
On October 23, 1891 a group of entrepreneurs obtain a 10-year permit to build the Edmonton Electric Lighting and Power Company on the banks of the North Saskatchewan River. The Edmonton Electrical Lighting and Power Company became a municipally owned electric utility in 1902, then the Electrical Distribution and Power Plant departments combined to form Edmonton Power in 1970. Electrical generation capacity was also expanded in 1970 with the coal fired Clover Bar Generating Station construction. Within the next eight years, another three units are added, bringing the combined generating capacity of the Clover bar and Rossdale generating stations to 1050 megawatts by 1979. Expansion occurred again in 1989 with the first Genesee unit is operating at full load and in 1994 with a second Genesee unit to a total capacity of both units to 850 megawatts. Electricity generated at Genesee was made commercially available through the Alberta Interconnected Grid in the early 1990s. EPCOR was formed from the merger of Edmonton's municipal natural gas, power and water utilities in 1996 and converted into a public company in 2006. Then EPCOR Utilities Inc. spun off its power generation business to create Capital Power Corporation in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epcor.ca/en-ca/about-epcor/corporate-overview/Pages/History.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alberta Electrical Distribution System====
This electrical system changed in 1996, when Alberta began to restructure its electricity market away from traditional regulation to a [[Alberta electricity policy|market-based system]]. The market now includes a host of buyers and sellers, and an increasingly diverse infrastructure.

Consumers range from residential buyers to huge industrial consumers mining the oil sands, operating pipelines and milling forest products. On the supply side, generators range from wind farms east of [[Crowsnest Pass]] to oilsands plants and other petroleum processing facilities which generate marketable electricity surplus to their own needs, to coal-fired plants near Edmonton. Because of lower altitude, cooler temperatures, greater supplies of water for cooling and steam generation, and large near surface supplies of thermal coal, central Alberta is thermodynamically the best place in Alberta to generate hydrocarbon-fuelled electricity.&lt;ref name="Keeping Electricity Competitive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://languageinstinct.blogspot.com/2008/09/keeping-electricity-competitive.html|title=Language Matters: Keeping Electricity Competitive|first=Peter|last=Mckenzie-brown|date=12 September 2008|website=languageinstinct.blogspot.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of Alberta’s electricity supply has increased substantially in recent years. To a large extent because of deregulation, the province has more technology, fuels, locations, ownership, and maintenance diversity than in the past and the rest of Canada. The system’s reliability, its cost structure and Alberta’s collective exposure to risk are now met by a complex system based on diverse power sources. However, overloaded power lines between northern Alberta  and the south of the province are wasting enough electricity to power half the city of [[Red Deer, Alberta]].&lt;ref name="Keeping Electricity Competitive"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertamsa.ca/files/The_Battery_and_the_Charger.pdf|title=The battery and the charger|author=|date=|website=albertamsa.ca|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current situation===
[[File:ManitobaHydroPointeduBois Generator.jpg|thumb|Pointe du Bois Generating Station on the [[Winnipeg River]]]]
[[Electricity sector in Canada|Electric power generation in Canada]] draws on [[hydroelectric]], nuclear, coal and natural gas, with a small but growing contribution from [[wind power]]. The electrification of Canada, was spurred from the US. The Niagara electrical power plant spurred industrial development in Southern Ontario.
Soon major rivers across Canada had hydro schemes on them. The Canadian electrical grid was closely connected to and supplied large amounts of energy to the U.S. electrical grid. Many provinces have had a provincially owned monopoly power generator, such as [[Ontario Hydro]], [[Manitoba Hydro]], [[Hydro-Québec]], [[Sask Power]] and [[BC Hydro]]. Many major provincial hydroelectric schemes also included federal involvement and subsidies. These concerns embarked on vast building schemes in the postwar years raising some of the largest dams in the world.

Ontario, Canada's most populous province, generates some 9,600 MW annually, over half of that coming from one dozen nuclear reactors. Ontario also has natural gas, and hydro facilities. However, Ontario faces a challenge as it must replace 80% of its generating capacity in the next twenty years—the old stations have time-expired and the nuclear reactors are overstressed. A debate continues over whether to go largely nuclear or go with renewables. Since the [[Green Energy Act 2009]], the debate has become even more heated.

== Nuclear power and Uranium ==
[[File:Bruce-Nuclear-Szmurlo.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]] near [[Kincardine, Ontario|Kincardine]], is the world's largest nuclear station with an installed capacity of 7,276 MW (gross).]]
{{See also|Nuclear power in Canada}}

Canada is a leader in the field of nuclear energy. Nuclear power in Canada is provided by [[List of nuclear reactors#Canada|19]] commercial reactors with a net capacity of 13.5 [[Watt|Gigawatts]] (GWe), producing a total of 95.6 [[Terawatt-hour]]s (TWh) of electricity, which accounted for 16.6% of the nation's total electric energy generation in 2015. All but one of these reactors are located in [[Ontario]] where they produced 61% of the province's electricity in 2016 (91.7 TWh).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieso.ca/power-data/supply-overview/transmission-connected-generation|title=IESO Supply Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ieso.ca|publisher=[[Independent Electricity System Operator]]|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven smaller reactors are used for research and to produce radioactive [[isotopes]] for [[nuclear medicine]].

Canadian nuclear reactors are a type of [[pressurized heavy-water reactor]] (PHWR) of indigenous design, the [[CANDU reactor]]. CANDU reactors have been exported to [[Rajasthan Atomic Power Station|India]], [[Karachi Nuclear Power Complex|Pakistan]], [[Embalse Nuclear Power Station|Argentina]], [[Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant|South Korea]], [[Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant|Romania]], and [[Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant|China]].

Uranium mining in Canada took off with the Great Bear Lake deposit furnishing some material for the [[Manhattan Project]].  Today [[Cameco]] and [[Areva Resources Canada]] are major produces of uranium for nuclear power.  [[Cameco]] mines the world's largest high-grade uranium deposit at the [[McArthur River uranium mine|McArthur River mine]] in Northern [[Saskatchewan]].

[[ZEEP]] was Canada's first nuclear reactor built in 1945.  Canada set up its [[NRX]] research reactor at [[Chalk River Laboratories]] in 1947.  In 1962 the [[NPD reactor]] in [[Rolphton, Ontario]] was the first prototype power reactor in Canada.  From this the [[National Research Council of Canada|NRC]] and the [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|AECL]] developed the [[CANDU]] reactor.  Ontario Hydro's first production power reactor was constructed at the [[Douglas Point]] in 1956.   Eighteen reactors were then built in the following four decades in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. In 2008 Nuclear power re-emerged with approved plans to build new reactors at existing stations at Darlington and Pickering, Ontario; another new station is planned for Peace River, AB. All are subject to planning and environmental reviews.

==Renewable energy and carbon neutral energy==
{{Main|Renewable energy in Canada}}
[[File:Magrath-Wind-Farm-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]

Canada generates a significant part of its electricity from hydroelectric dams, but has otherwise limited renewable energy generation, although [[wind power in Canada|wind power]] is growing quickly. The first commercial wind farm in Canada was built in Alberta in 1993. A 20 megawatt tidal plant sits at [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis, Nova Scotia]], and uses the daily tides of the [[Bay of Fundy]].

The first commercial solar project was built in [[Stone Mills]], [[Ontario]] in 2009.[[Skypower Ltd]], used over 120,000 thin film photovoltaic solar panels, for a total of 9,1 megawatt, creating clean [[solar energy]] for 1000 homes annually.

Politicians have been willing to subsidize renewable methods using taxpayer funds to increase the amount and percentage of Canada's electricity generated.

==Energy conservation in Canada==

After the 1973 Oil Crisis, energy conservation became practical with smaller cars and insulated homes.
Appliances were improved to use less energy.  In the recent years, this successfully lead to both a reduction in energy use and CO2-emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Energy Use Database Table - Commercial Sector | publisher = Natural Resources Canada | date = 2011 | url = http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/corporate/statistics/neud/dpa/showTable.cfm?type=CP&amp;sector=com&amp;juris=ca&amp;rn=1&amp;page=4&amp;CFID=34878564&amp;CFTOKEN=a1d958bc131f5638-F6570DF8-FF1A-28EE-DC92595A91203479 | accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Energy Use Database Table - Residential Sector | publisher = Natural Resources Canada | date = 2011 | url = http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/corporate/statistics/neud/dpa/showTable.cfm?type=CP&amp;sector=res&amp;juris=ca&amp;rn=1&amp;page=4&amp;CFID=34878564&amp;CFTOKEN=a1d958bc131f5638-F6570DF8-FF1A-28EE-DC92595A91203479 | accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the adaptation of new technologies in civil engineering also caused new issues, such as the [[Urea-formaldehyde]] insulation disaster and the ongoing [[Leaky condo crisis]].

The '''fiery flying serpent''' is a creature mentioned in the [[Book of Isaiah]] (30:6).

==Isaiah==
* Isaiah 14:29: "Do not rejoice, all you of Philistia, because the rod that struck you is broken; for out of the serpent's roots will come a viper, and its offspring will be a fiery flying serpent."
* Isaiah 30:6: "The burden against the beasts of the South.  Through a land of trouble and anguish, from which came the lioness and the lion, the viper and the fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people who shall not profit;"

References to "fiery serpents" lacking a mention of flight can be found in several places in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

* Deuteronomy 8:15 "Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;"
* Numbers 21:6-8 "(6) And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. (7) Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. (8) And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live."  This symbol, the [[Nehushtan]], is similar to the [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek]] [[Rod of Asclepius|Rod of Asklepios]] (frequently confused with the [[Caduceus as a symbol of medicine|caduceus]]) and is frequently cited as an instance of the same [[archetype]].

==Book of Mormon==
* The [[Book of Mormon]]: 1Nephi 17:41 "...he sent fiery flying serpents among them; and after they were bitten he prepared a way that they might be healed;"

==Herodotus==
In the [[Histories (Herodotus)|History of Herodotus]], Book 2, [[Herodotus]] describes flying winged serpents.

==Cicero==
In Cicero's ''[[De Natura Deorum|On the Nature of the Gods]]'' Book 1 XXXVI, Cotta describes how the Egyptian ibis was deified because it "protects Egypt from plague, by killing and eating the flying serpents that are brought from the Libyan desert..."

The '''(Flora Hiperspectral)''' satellite, initially scheduled to launch in 2017, is a proposed [[Brazil]]ian–[[United States|American]] [[earth observation satellite]]. It will produce [[hyperspectral]] surface images of comparable resolution to [[Landsat]] satellites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inpe.br/noticias/arquivos/pdf/Plano_diretor_miolo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Flora Hiperspectral is a joint project between the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) of [[NASA]] and the [[National Institute for Space Research]] of Brazil.

==Objective==

This mission will produce the first time in orbit, hyperspectral images with a spatial resolution and global coverage comparable to that of the Landsat satellite and [[CBERS|CBERS program]]. Data will study the biochemical and biophysical properties of soil cover and the action of man (for example, deforestation and fires) on ecosystem functioning.

Hyperspectral data are obtained in narrow strips, contiguous and in sufficient number to build spectra similar to the laboratory. Indicate biochemical characteristics (e.g., nutrient levels, moisture) and biophysical plants. Detect water stress, diseases, or difficulties in adapting to the ground culture. They measure of mineral absorption in exposed surfaces of rocks. In coastal and inland waters, measure [[chlorophyll]] and suspended sediment. The satellite monitoring currently only allows to observe if there is forest or not. The Plant will be able to check the chemical and physical characteristics of the vegetation, which today no [[satellite]] can do. According to reports, it will be 10 times more advanced than any satellite of the same type.

[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]] will provide an instrument, which cost 150 million dollars and [[Brazil]] come with providing about US$110 million, concerning a part of the satellite and part of the launch.

==Instruments==
High spectral resolution camera (200 bands between 400 and 2500&amp;nbsp;nm along a 150&amp;nbsp;km swath.
Spatial resolution is 30 meters, with 14 bits quantization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6865">[[Image:TincaTincaWeerribben.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Tench]] are common freshwater fish throughout temperate Eurasia.]]

'''Freshwater fish''' are those that spend some or all of their lives in [[fresh water]], such as [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, with a [[salinity]] of less than 0.05%. These environments differ from marine conditions in many ways, the most obvious being the difference in levels of salinity. To survive fresh water, the fish need a range of [[physiology|physiological]] [[adaptation]]s.

41.24% of all known species of [[fish]] are found in fresh water. This is primarily due to the rapid [[speciation]] that the scattered habitats make possible. When dealing with ponds and lakes, one might use the same basic models of speciation as when studying [[island biogeography]].

== Physiology ==
Freshwater fish differ physiologically from salt water fish in several respects. Their [[gill]]s must be able to diffuse dissolved gasses while keeping the salts in the body fluids inside. Their scales reduce water diffusion through the skin: freshwater fish that have lost too many scales will die. They also have well developed [[kidney]]s to reclaim salts from body fluids before excretion.&lt;!-- Fish breeders forum: [[Media:http://z11.invisionfree.com/elitebreeders/]] (beware that forums may contain inaccurate and controversial information)yes
 --&gt;

== Migrating fish ==
[[Image:Sturgeon.jpg|thumb|260px|left|[[Sturgeon]]s are found both in anadromous and fresh water stationary forms]]
Many species of fish do reproduce in freshwater, but spend most of their adult lives in the sea. These are known as [[anadromous]] fish, and include, for instance, [[salmon]], [[trout]], sea lamprey&lt;ref&gt;Silva, S., Araújo, M. J., Bao, M., Mucientes, G., &amp; Cobo, F. (2014). The haematophagous feeding stage of anadromous populations of sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus: low host selectivity and wide range of habitats. Hydrobiologia, 734(1), 187-199.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[three-spined stickleback]]. Some other kinds of fish are, on the contrary, born in salt water, but live most of or parts of their adult lives in fresh water; for instance the [[Anguillidae|eels]]. These are known as catadromous fish.

Species migrating between marine and fresh waters need adaptations for both environments; when in salt water they need to keep the bodily salt concentration on a level lower than the surroundings, and vice versa. Many species solve this problem by associating different habitats with different stages of life. Both eels, anadromous salmoniform fish and the [[sea lamprey]] have different tolerances in salinity in different stages of their lives.

==Classification in the United States==
Among fishers in the United States, freshwater fish species are usually classified by the water temperature in which they survive.  The water temperature affects the amount of oxygen available as cold water contains more oxygen than warm water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.takemefishing.org/freshwater-fishing/freshwater-fish-species/|title=Freshwater Fish Species|accessdate=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coldwater===
Coldwater fish species survive in the coldest temperatures, preferring a water temperature of {{convert|50|to(-)|60|F|C}}.  In [[North America]], air temperatures that result in sufficiently cold water temperatures are found in the [[northern United States]], [[Canada]], and in the [[Sun Belt|southern United States]] at high [[elevation]].  Common coldwater fish include [[brook trout]], [[rainbow trout]], and [[brown trout]].

===Warmwater===
Warmwater fish species can survive in a wide range of conditions, preferring a water temperature around {{convert|80|F|C}}. Warmwater fish can survive cold winter temperatures in northern climates, but thrive in warmer water.  Common warmwater fish include [[catfish]], [[largemouth bass]], [[bluegill]], [[crappies]], and many other species from the [[Centrarchidae]] family.

===Coolwater===
Coolwater fish species prefer water temperature between the coldwater and warmwater species, around {{convert|60|to(-)|80|F|C}}.  They are found throughout North America except for the southern portions of the United States.  Common coolwater species include [[muskellunge]], [[northern pike]], [[walleye]], and [[yellow perch]]

== Status ==
=== North America ===
About four in ten [[North American]] freshwater fish are endangered, according to a pan-North American study, the main cause being human pollution. The number of fish species and subspecies to become endangered has risen from 40 to 61, since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080911/freshwater_fish_080911/20080911?hub=SciTech |title=Freshwater fish in North America endangered: study |accessdate=2008-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913154148/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080911/freshwater_fish_080911/20080911?hub=SciTech |archivedate=2008-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Geodesy}}
'''Geodynamics''' is a subfield of [[geophysics]] dealing with [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] of the [[Earth]]. It applies physics, chemistry and mathematics to the understanding of how [[mantle convection]] leads to [[plate tectonics]] and geologic phenomena such as [[seafloor spreading]], [[mountain building]], [[volcanoes]], [[earthquakes]], [[fault (geology)|faulting]] and so on. It also attempts to probe the internal activity  by measuring [[magnetic field]]s, gravity, and [[seismic wave]]s, as well as the [[mineralogy]] of rocks and their [[isotope geochemistry|isotopic composition]]. Methods of geodynamics are also applied to exploration of other planets.&lt;ref name=Ismail-Zadeh2010&gt;{{harvnb|Ismail-Zadeh|Tackley|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Geodynamics is generally concerned with processes that move materials throughout the Earth. In the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth’s interior]], movement happens when rocks [[Melt (geology)|melt]] or [[Deformation (mechanics)|deform]] and flow in response to a [[stress field]].&lt;ref name=Turcotte2014&gt;Turcotte, D. L. and G. Schubert (2014). "Geodynamics."&lt;/ref&gt;  This deformation may be [[Brittle deformation|brittle]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], or [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]], depending on the magnitude of the stress and the material’s physical properties, especially the stress relaxation time scale. Rocks are structurally and compositionally heterogeneous and are subjected to variable stresses, so it is common to see different types of deformation in close spatial and temporal proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Winters, J. D. (2001). "An introduction to igenous and metamorphic petrology."&lt;/ref&gt; When working with geological timescales and lengths, it is convenient to use the continuous medium approximation and equilibrium stress fields to consider the average response to average stress.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, W. I. (2012). "Continuum Mechanics in the Earth Sciences."&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts in geodynamics commonly use data from [[geodetic system|geodetic]] [[GPS]], [[InSAR]], and [[seismology]], along with [[numerical model]]s, to study the evolution of the Earth's [[lithosphere]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[Outer core|core]].

Work performed by geodynamicists may include:
* Modeling brittle and [[ductile]] deformation of geologic materials
* Predicting patterns of continental [[accretion (geology)|accretion]] and breakup of [[continent]]s and [[supercontinent]]s
* Observing surface deformation and relaxation due to [[ice sheets]] and [[post-glacial rebound]], and making related conjectures about the [[viscosity]] of the mantle
* Finding and understanding the driving mechanisms behind [[plate tectonics]].

==Deformation of rocks==
{{About|deformation in geology|a more rigorous treatment|Deformation (mechanics)}}
Rocks and other geological materials experience [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] according to three distinct modes, elastic, plastic, and brittle depending on the properties of the material and the magnitude of the [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] field. Stress is defined as the average force per unit area exerted on each part of the rock. [[Pressure]] is the part of stress that changes the volume of a solid; [[shear stress]] changes the shape. If there is no shear, the fluid is in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. Since, over long periods, rocks readily deform under pressure, the Earth is in hydrostatic equilibrium to a good approximation. The pressure on rock depends only on the weight of the rock above, and this depends on gravity and the density of the rock. In a body like the [[Moon]], the density is almost constant, so a pressure profile is readily calculated. In the Earth, the compression of rocks with depth is significant, and an [[equation of state]] is needed to calculate changes in density of rock even when it is of uniform composition.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2002&gt;{{harvnb|Turcotte|Schubert|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elastic===
[[Deformation (engineering)#Elastic deformation|Elastic deformation]] is always reversible, which means that if the stress field associated with elastic deformation is removed, the material will return to its previous state. Materials only behave elastically when the relative arrangement along the axis being considered of material components (e.g. atoms or crystals) remains unchanged. This means that the magnitude of the stress cannot exceed the yield strength of a material, and the time scale of the stress cannot approach the relaxation time of the material. If stress exceeds the yield strength of a material, bonds begin to break (and reform), which can lead to ductile or brittle deformation.&lt;ref name=Karato2008&gt;Karato, Shun-ichiro (2008). "Deformation of Earth Materials: An Introduction to the Rheology of Solid Earth."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ductile===
Ductile or [[Deformation (engineering)#Elastic deformation|plastic deformation]] happens when the temperature of a system is high enough so that a significant fraction of the material microstates (figure 1) are unbound, which means that a large fraction of the chemical bonds are in the process of being broken and reformed. During ductile deformation, this process of atomic rearrangement redistributes stress and strain towards equilibrium faster than they can accumulate.&lt;ref name=Karato2008 /&gt; Examples include bending of the lithosphere under [[volcanic island]]s or [[sedimentary basin]]s, and bending at [[oceanic trenches]].&lt;ref name=Turcotte2002/&gt; Ductile deformation happens when transport processes such as diffusion and advection that rely on chemical bonds to be broken and reformed redistribute strain about as fast as it accumulates.

===Brittle===
When strain localizes faster than these relaxation processes can redistribute it, [[Deformation (engineering)#Fracture|brittle deformation]] occurs. The mechanism for brittle deformation involves a positive feedback between the accumulation or propagation of defects especially those produced by strain in areas of high strain, and the localization of strain along these dislocations and fractures. In other words, any fracture, however small, tends to focus strain at its leading edge, which causes the fracture to extend.&lt;ref name=Karato2008 /&gt;

In general, the mode of deformation is controlled not only by the amount of stress, but also by the distribution of strain and strain associated features. Whichever mode of deformation ultimately occurs is the result of a competition between processes that tend to localize strain, such as fracture propagation, and relaxational processes, such as annealing, that tend to delocalize strain.

===Deformation structures===
Structural geologists study the results of deformation, using observations of rock, especially the mode and geometry of deformation to reconstruct the stress field that affected the rock over time. [[Structural geology]] is an important complement to geodynamics because it provides the most direct source of data about the movements of the Earth. Different modes of deformation result in distinct geological structures, e.g. brittle fracture in rocks or ductile folding.

==Thermodynamics==
The physical characteristics of rocks that control the rate and mode of strain, such as [[yield strength]] or [[viscosity]], depend on the [[thermodynamic state]] of the rock and composition. The most important thermodynamic variables in this case are temperature and pressure. Both of these increase with depth, so to a first approximation the mode of deformation can be understood in terms of depth. Within the upper lithosphere, brittle deformation is common because under low pressure rocks have relatively low brittle strength, while at the same time low temperature reduces the likelihood of ductile flow. After the brittle-ductile transition zone, ductile deformation becomes dominant.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2014 /&gt; Elastic deformation happens when the time scale of stress is shorter than the relaxation time for the material. Seismic waves are a common example of this type of deformation. At temperatures high enough to melt rocks, the ductile shear strength approaches zero, which is why shear mode elastic deformation (S-Waves) will not propagate through melts.&lt;ref&gt;Faul, U. H., J. D. F. Gerald and I. Jackson (2004). "Shear wave attenuation and dispersion in melt-bearing olivine&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamics of the Earth==
The main motive force behind stress in the Earth is provided by thermal energy from radioisotope decay, friction, and residual heat.&lt;ref&gt;Hager, B. H. and R. W. Clayton (1989). "Constraints on the structure of mantle convection using seismic observations, flow models, and the geoid." Fluid Mechanics of Astrophysics and Geophysics 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, C. (1995). "Heat flow of the Earth."&lt;/ref&gt; Cooling at the surface and heat production within the Earth create a metastable thermal gradient from the hot core to the relatively cool lithosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Dziewonski, A. M. and D. L. Anderson (1981). "Preliminary reference Earth model." Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors 25(4): 297-356.&lt;/ref&gt; This thermal energy is converted into mechanical energy by thermal expansion. Deeper hotter and often have higher thermal expansion and lower density relative to overlying rocks. Conversely, rock that is cooled at the surface can become less buoyant than the rock below it. Eventually this can lead to a Rayleigh-Taylor instability (Figure 2), or interpenetration of rock on different sides of the buoyancy contrast.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ribe, N. M. (1998). "Spouting and planform selection in the Rayleigh–Taylor instability of miscible viscous fluids." Journal of Fluid Mechanics 377: 27-45.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Model of the initiation of termination of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability in 2D.gif|thumb|Figure 2 shows a [[Rayleigh-Taylor instability]] in 2D using the [[Shan-Chen model]]. The red fluid is initially located in a layer on top of the blue fluid, and is less buoyant than the blue fluid. After some time, a Rayleigh-Taylor instability occurs, and the red fluid penetrates the blue one.]]
Negative thermal buoyancy of the oceanic plates is the primary cause of subduction and plate tectonics,&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, C. P. and C. Lithgow-Bertelloni (2004). "The temporal evolution of plate driving forces: Importance of “slab suction” versus “slab pull” during the Cenozoic." Journal of Geophysical Research 109(B10): 2156-2202.&lt;/ref&gt; while positive thermal buoyancy may lead to mantle plumes, which could explain intraplate volcanism.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, B., N. M. Ribe, A. Stracke, A. E. Saal and S. P. Turner (2006). "Insights into the dynamics of mantle plumes from uranium-series geochemistry." Nature 444(7): 713-716.&lt;/ref&gt; The relative importance of heat production vs. heat loss for buoyant convection throughout the whole Earth remains uncertain and understanding the details of buoyant convection is a key focus of geodynamics.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2014 /&gt;

==Methods==
Geodynamics is a broad field which combines observations from many different types of geological study into a broad picture of the dynamics of Earth.  Close to the surface of the Earth, data includes field observations, geodesy, [[radiometric dating]], [[petrology]], mineralogy, drilling [[borehole]]s and [[remote sensing]] techniques.  However, beyond a few kilometers depth, most of these kinds of observations become impractical. Geologists studying the geodynamics of the mantle and core must rely entirely on remote sensing, especially seismology, and experimentally recreating the conditions found in the Earth in high pressure high temperature experiments.(see also [[Adams–Williamson equation]]). 

=== Numerical modeling ===
Because of the complexity of geological systems, computer modeling is used to test theoretical predictions about geodynamics using data from these sources.

There are two main ways of geodynamic numerical modeling &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tackley|first=Paul J.|title=Numerical and laboratory studies of mantle convection: Philosophy, accomplishments, and thermochemical structure and evolution|date=2005|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/160GM07|work=Earth's Deep Mantle: Structure, Composition, and Evolution|pages=83–99|publisher=American Geophysical Union|language=en|doi=10.1029/160gm07|isbn=9780875904252|access-date=2018-10-10|last2=Xie|first2=Shunxing|last3=Nakagawa|first3=Takashi|last4=Hernlund|first4=John W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

# Modelling to reproduce a specific observation: This approach aims to answer what causes a specific state of a particular system.
# Modelling to produce basic fluid dynamics: This approach aims to answer how a specific system works in general.

Basic fluid dynamics modelling can further be subdivided into instantaneous studies, which aim to reproduce the instantaneous flow in a system due to a given buoyancy distribution, and time-dependent studies, which either aim to reproduce a possible evolution of a given initial condition over time or a statistical (quasi) steady-state of a given system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3909">In [[geophysics]], a '''geomagnetic jerk''' or '''secular geomagnetic variation impulse''' is a relatively sudden change in the [[derivative (mathematics)|second derivative]] of the [[geomagnetic field|Earth's magnetic field]] with respect to time.&lt;ref name="michelis"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

These events were noted by Courtillot and others in 1978. The clearest ones, observed all over the world, happened in 1969, 1978, 1991, and 1999.  Data before 1969 is scarcer, but there is evidence of other global jerks in 1901, 1913, and 1925.  Other events in 1932, 1949, 1958, 1986, and 2003 were detected only in some parts of the world.&lt;ref name="michelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mioara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="olsen"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  These events are believed to originate in the [[interior of the Earth]] (rather than being due to external phenomena such as the [[solar wind]]); but their precise cause is still a matter of research.&lt;ref name="olsen"/&gt;

The name [[Jerk (physics)|"jerk"]] was borrowed from [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]], where it means the [[jerk (physics)|rate of change of the acceleration]] of a body, that is, the third derivative of its position with respect to time (the [[acceleration]] being the second derivative); or, more specifically, a sudden and momentary [[impulse function|spike (or dip)]] in that rate.

==Description==

Jerks seem to occur in irregular intervals, on average about once every 10 years.  In the period between jerks, each component of the field at a specific location changes with time ''t'' approximately as a fixed [[polynomial]] of the second degree, ''A'' ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''B'' ''t'' + ''C''.  Each jerk is a relatively sudden change (spread over a period of a few months to a couple of years) in the ''A'' [[coefficient]] of this formula, which determines the second derivative; and usually in ''B'' and ''C'' coefficients as well.

The strength of each jerk varies from location to location, and some jerks are observed only in some regions. For example, the 1949 jerk was clearly observed at [[Tucson]] ([[North America]], [[longitude|long.]] 110.93°), but not at [[Chambon la Forêt]] ([[Europe]], long. 2.27°).  Moreover, the global jerks seem to occur at slightly different times in different regions; often earlier in the Northern hemisphere than in the Southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="michelis"/&gt;

==Theories==

These events are believed to be caused by changes in the flow patterns of the liquid [[outer core of the Earth]].&lt;ref name="mioara"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that they are due to torsional oscillations in the solid [[inner core of the Earth]].&lt;ref name="michelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blox"&gt;

'''George Joseph''' (born 4 August 1938) is an Indian space scientist, best known for his contributions to the development of [[remote sensing]] technology in India, especially in the field of earth observation sensors. He is a former chairman of the Lunar Mission Study Task Force of the [[Indian Space Research Organization]] and an elected fellow of the [[National Academy of Sciences, India]], [[Indian Academy of Sciences]] and [[Indian National Academy of Engineering]]. The [[Government of India]] awarded him the [[Padma Bhushan]], the third highest civilian award, in 1999.

==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2018}}
George Joseph was born on 4 August 1938 to Advocate M. G. Joseph and Alice in [[Madras Presidency]], [[British India]].  After completing schooling, he joined [[St.Berchmans College]], [[Changanassery]] and also attended Alagappa Chettiar College in [[Karaikudi]]  and [[University College, Trivandrum]]. He served as lecturer in [[Union Christian College, Aluva]]  and  at [[CMS College Kottayam]]. Afterwards he was a trainee at [[Bhabha Atomic Research Center]] (BARC), [[Mumbai|Bombay]].

Joseph is married to Mercy and they have two sons.

==Research career==

Joseph started his research career in 1962 at the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]](TIFR), Bombay, where he was involved in the study of cosmic rays.&lt;ref name="Dr George Joseph Awarded India's Civilian Award and Premier Remote Sensing Award"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.isprs.org/publications/highlights/highlights0402/indianaward.pdf |title=Dr George Joseph Awarded India's Civilian Award and Premier Remote Sensing Award |date=2018-06-07 |website=ISPRS |access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his research work at TIFR he was awarded PhD degree by the Bombay University.  A novel detector system designed by him was flown on the first Indian satellite [[Aryabhata (satellite)]] to detect solar neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sac.gov.in/asac-leaders-g-joseph.html SAC Directors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to the Indian Space Programme==

In 1973, Joseph  was invited to join the [[Space Applications Centre]], Ahmedabad-one of the centers of the [[Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO),and initiated the development of remote sensing technology particularly sensors of various types.&lt;ref name="Space Applications Centre profile"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sac.gov.in/Vyom/Dr.GeorgeJoseph.jsp |title=Space Applications Centre profile |date=2018-06-07 |website=www.sac.gov.in |access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been the guiding force in the design and development of all the earth observation cameras on board [[Indian Remote Sensing Satellite]](IRS) and [[INSAT]].  He served ISRO in various capacities including Director, Space Applications Centre and took keen interest and initiative to ensure the fruits of space technology reach common man.  One of the noteworthy contributions of Joseph  is the study report on Indian Mission to Moon in the capacity as Chairman, Lunar Mission Study Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/sep2002/indi-s06.shtml What lies behind India’s planned trip to the moon?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moon within our reach: Isro - Times of India"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Moon-within-our-reach-Isro/articleshow/18898116.cms |title=Moon within our reach: Isro - Times of India |date=August 12, 2002 |website=The Times of India |access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph has served in a number of national and international committees/organizations including President of Technical Commission -I of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing ([[ISPRS]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isprs.org/technical_commissions9600/tc_1.html ISPRS Technical Commission -I]&lt;/ref&gt; during 1996-2000 and Director, Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific (CSSTEAP), (affiliated to the United Nations), with headquarters at Dehradun during 2006-2009.&lt;ref name="Dr George Joseph Appointed Director of UN-affiliated Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific - ISRO"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.isro.gov.in/update/08-dec-2006/dr-george-joseph-appointed-director-of-un-affiliated-centre-space-science-and |title=Dr George Joseph Appointed Director of UN-affiliated Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific - ISRO |website=www.isro.gov.in |language=en |access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isro.org/pressrelease/scripts/pressreleasein.aspx?Dec08_2006  Dr George Joseph Appointed Director of UN-affiliated Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cssteap.org/george.html Center for Space Science &amp; Technology Education in Asia &amp; The Pacific (CSSTEAP)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haar rolling in over the Forth Bridge.jpg|thumb|299x299px]]
In [[meteorology]], '''haar''' or '''sea fret''' is a cold [[sea fog]].  It occurs most often on the east coast of England or Scotland between April and September, when warm air passes over the cold [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pirie|first1=Gail|title=Sea Fog|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/surfing/sites/features/pages/seafog.shtml|website=BBC.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="haar"|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/haar|website=oxforddictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Haar is typically formed over the sea and is blown to the land by the wind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989QJRMS.115..581F Findlater, J.; Roach, W. T.; McHugh, B. C., Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, vol. 115, Issue 487, p.581-608]&lt;/ref&gt; This commonly occurs when warmer moist air moves over the relatively cooler North Sea causing the moisture in the air to condense, forming haar.  

[[Sea breezes]] and easterly winds then bring the haar into the east coast of Scotland and North-East England where it can continue for several miles inland.  This can be common in the UK summer when heating of the land creates a sea breeze, bringing haar in from the sea and as a result can significantly reduce temperatures compared to those just a few miles inland.

==Nomenclature==
The term ''haar'' is used along certain lands bordering the [[North Sea]], primarily eastern  [[Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannia.org/scotland/scotsdictionary/h.shtml Scots Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the north-east of England. Variants of the term in [[Scots language|Scots]] and northern English include har, hare, harl, harr and hoar.  The origin may be Low German/Middle Dutch ''hare''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=haar&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=all SND: Haar]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=6-cQAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22A+Glossary+of+North+Country+Words,+in+Use:+With+Their+Etymology%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=uuO6hQXVbY&amp;sig=4Luu6dH7szjMyrfbfoGQXVNjsT8&amp;ei=bNaVSaPiJKKHjAfIovW7Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPP2,M1 A Glossary of North Country Words, in Use: With Their Etymology, John Trotter Brockett, 1829, p147]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Yorkshire and Northumberland it is commonly referred to as a sea fret.&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17667">'''Holy places''' are sites that religions considers to be of special religious significance. Holy places are often visited by [[pilgrim]]s.

==Baha'i==
Located in [[Bahji]] near [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Israel]], the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]] is the most holy place for [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] and their [[Qiblih]], or direction of prayer. It contains the remains of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the Bahá'í Faith and is near the spot where he died in the [[Mansion of Bahjí]]. The second holiest site is the [[Shrine of the Báb]] in [[Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/misc/adh_holy.html|title=Holy Places of the World|work=adherents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], the Baha'is possessed several important holy sites, including the [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|House of the Bab]] in [[Shiraz]]; the [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|House of Baha]]' [[Allah]]'s father in [[Tehran]]; the shrine and grave of [[Quddús|Quddus]]. Since the Revolution, all these places have been demolished, and a mosque has been built on the site of the Bab's house.

==Buddhism==
[[File:Mahabodhitemple.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Mahabodhi Temple]] is an important [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] pilgrimage site.|alt=The Mahabodhi Temple towering above its surroundings like a skyscraper carved of stone]]
{{see also|Buddhist pilgrimage}}
[[Gautama Buddha|The Buddha]] is said to have identified four sites most worthy of pilgrimage for [[Buddhists]], saying that they would produce a feeling of spiritual urgency. These are:&lt;ref&gt;The Buddha mentions these four pilgrimage sites in the [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]. See, for instance, Thanissaro (1998)[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.5-6.than.html#pilgrim] and Vajira &amp; Story (1998)[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html#t-42].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bodh Gaya]], [[India]], is the most important religious site and place of pilgrimage, the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] houses what is believed to be the [[Bodhi Tree]] where the Buddha realized enlightenment and Buddhahood.
*[[Kushinagar]], India, is where the Buddha attained Parinirvana after his death.
*[[Lumbini]], [[Nepal]], is where [[Queen Maya]] gave birth to Prince Siddhartha Gautama.
*[[Sarnath]], India, is the deer park where the Buddha first taught the Dhamma after realizing enlightenment.

In the later commentarial tradition, four more sites were added to make Eight Great Places, places where a miraculous event is reported to have occurred:
*[[Sravasti]]: Place of the Twin Miracle, showing his supernatural abilities in performance of miracles. Sravasti is also the place where Buddha spent the largest amount of time, being a major city in ancient India.
*[[Rajgir]]: Place of the subduing of Nalagiri, the angry elephant, through friendliness. Rajgir was another major city of ancient India.
*[[Sankassa]]: Place of the descending to earth from [[Tusita]] heaven (after a stay of 3 months teaching his mother the [[Abhidhamma]]).
*[[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]]: Place of receiving an offering of honey from a monkey. Vaishali was the capital of the Vajjian Republic of ancient India.

There are various other locations in India and Nepal associated with the Buddha, and there are holy sites located throughout Asia for each Buddhist tradition, for instance in Afghanistan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, South Korea and Thailand. [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] contains many culturally significant [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] sites such as the [[Potala Palace]], [[Jokhang]] temple and [[Norbulingka]] palaces.

==Christianity==
[[File:Holy sepulchre mass.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] is one of the most important [[pilgrimage]] sites in [[Christianity]].]]
[[File:Bethany (5).JPG|thumb|200px|[[Al-Maghtas]] ruins on the Jordanian side of the [[Jordan River]] are the location for the baptism of [[Jesus]] and the ministry of [[John the Baptist]].]]
{{see also|Jerusalem in Christianity|Christian pilgrimage}}
In [[Christianity]], the holy places are significant because they are the place of [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]], [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of [[Jesus]], the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Saviour]] or [[Messiah]] to Christianity.
Holy cities for Christians of all denominations{{cn|date=March 2018}}
* [[Jerusalem]] is believed to be the site of some of [[Jesus]]'s teaching, the [[Last Supper]], the subsequent institution of the [[Holy Eucharist]] as well as his entombment; Christians believe he was crucified on a nearby hill, [[Calvary|Golgotha]] (sometimes called Calvary). It contains the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Via Dolorosa]], [[Mount Zion]] and the [[Dormition Abbey]], and [[Gethsemane#Pilgrimage site|Gethsemane]] (with [[Mary's Tomb]] and the [[Church of All Nations]]).
* [[Nazareth]] is Jesus's hometown and the site of many holy places, including the [[Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation|Church of the Annunciation]] and [[Mary's Well]].
* [[Bethlehem]] is the birthplace of Jesus.
* [[Cana]] is where Jesus made his first miracle (Turned the water into wine)
* [[Al-Maghtas]], this site has been recognized as the original site where Jesus was baptized by all the major traditional Christian Churches. The site is in [[Jordan]]
* [[Machaerus]], the Herodias fortress where [[beheading of St. John the Baptist|John the Baptist]] was imprisoned and beheaded. The site is in [[Jordan]]
* [[Mount Nebo]], traditional site of the death of [[Moses]] and where he looked over to the "promised land". The site is in [[Jordan]]

During the [[Crusades]], Christian [[pilgrims]] often sought out the holy places in the [[Outremer]], especially early in the 12th century immediately after [[Jerusalem]] was captured.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Martin, ''The Knights Templar: The History &amp; Myths of the Legendary Military Order'', 2005. {{ISBN|1-56025-645-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holy places included sites in Jerusalem and Bethlehem as well as:{{cn|date=March 2018}}
* [[Tzippori|Sephoria]], where the [[Virgin Mary]] was said to have spent her childhood
* The [[River Jordan]], site of Christ's [[baptism]]
* Cave dwelling of [[John the Baptist]]
* [[Syria]]
* [[Galilee]] (North Israel/South Lebanon)
* [[Sea of Galilee]]
* [[Mount Tabor, Israel|Mount Tabor]], site of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]]
* [[Jericho]], along the road to which was the location of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]]'s charity.

[[File:Kaaba at night.jpg|thumbnail|150px|[[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] at night]]
The three holiest sites in [[Islam]] are the [[Masjid al-Haram]], or [[Masjid al-Haram|Grand Mosque]], (in [[Mecca]]) ; the [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]], or [[Prophet's Mosque]], (in [[Medina]]) and [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Every year millions of Muslims from all over the world visit [[Masjid al-Haram]] and [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] to perform Hajj.

Muslims are also required, if able, to undertake a pilgrimage to Mecca ([[Hajj]]) ({{IPAc-en|h|æ|dʒ}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hajj "Hajj"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ar|حَجّ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ḥaǧǧ}}'' "[[wikt:pilgrimage|pilgrimage]]") at least once in one's life:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Juan Eduardo Campo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2696-8|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=OZbyz_Hr–eIC&amp;pg=PA281 281]}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cn span|date=May 2018|it is strongly recommended to do it as often as possible, preferably once a year. Only individuals whose financial position and health are severely insufficient are exempt from making Hajj (e.g. if making Hajj would put stress on one's financial situation, but would not end up in homelessness or starvation, it is still required). During this pilgrimage, the Muslims spend three to seven days in worship, performing several strictly-defined rituals, most notably circumnavigating the [[Qaaba]] among millions of other Muslims and the "stoning of the devil" at Mina. At the end of the [[Hajj]], the heads of men are shaved, sheep and other [[halal]] animals, notably camels, are slaughtered as a ritual sacrifice by bleeding out at the neck according to a strictly-prescribed ritual slaughter method similar to the Jewish [[kashrut]], to commemorate the moment when, according to Islamic tradition, Allah replaced Abraham's son [[Ishmael]] (contrasted with the Judaeo-Christian tradition that Isaac was the intended sacrifice) with a sheep, thereby preventing human sacrifice. The meat from these animals is then distributed locally to needy Muslims, neighbors and relatives.}}

The next two holiest sites especially for [[Shia Islam]] are the [[Imam Ali Mosque]] and the [[Imam Husayn Shrine|Imam Husayn shrine]] (which is visited by more pilgrims than any other holy site in any religion. More than 18 millions people visited on the day of Ashura in 2018)

==Judaism==
[[File:Israel-Western Wall.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Western Wall]] by night.|alt=Jews praying at the Western Wall in the evening]]
{{see also|Temple Mount|Jerusalem in Judaism}}
In [[Jewish]] tradition, the [[Temple Mount]] is regarded as the place where [[Yahweh|God]] chose the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] to rest. Jewish tradition regards the Mount, or the [[Foundation Stone]], as the location of a number of important events mentioned in the Bible, including the location from which the world expanded into its present form, Abraham's [[binding of Isaac]], [[Jacob]]'s dream,&lt;ref&gt;[[Toledot]] 25:21&lt;/ref&gt; the threshing floor which King [[David]] purchased from [[Araunah]] the [[Jebusite]],&lt;ref&gt;[[2 Samuel]] 24:18–25&lt;/ref&gt; and the location of the two Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temples]]. Jewish texts record that the Mount will be the site of the [[Third Temple]], which will be rebuilt with the coming of the messiah.

The Temple Mount is the holiest site in [[Judaism]] and is the place to which Jews turn during prayer. Due to its extreme sanctity, many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself, to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the [[Holy of Holies]] stood. The Temple is mentioned extensively in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jewish services|services]]. [[Conservative Judaism]] mentions the Temple and its restoration, but not its [[korban|sacrifices]]. The destruction of the Temple is mourned on the Jewish fast day of [[Tisha B'Av]], and is remembered on a number of occasions such as in the breaking of a glass at the end of a wedding ceremony. Due to religious restrictions on entering the most sacred areas of the Temple Mount (see following section), the [[Western Wall]], a retaining wall of the Temple Mount and remnant of the [[Second Temple]] structure, is considered by some rabbinical authorities the holiest accessible site for Jews to pray.

Jerusalem itself is also the holiest city in Judaism, and the spiritual center of the Jewish people since the 10th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=256076 Why Do Jews Love Jerusalem?] by Yeruchem Eilfort.

The [[Panj Takht]] are the five gurudwaras which are revered as the seats of power in [[Sikhism]]. They are all located in [[India]] - the [[Akal Takht|Akal Takht Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]; the [[Keshgarh Sahib]] in [[Anandpur Sahib]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]; the [[Damdama Sahib]] in [[Bhatinda]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]; the [[Takht Sri Patna Sahib]] in [[Patna]], [[Bihar]] and the [[Hazur Sahib Nanded]] in [[Nanded]], [[Maharashtra]].

Sri [[Harmandir Sahib]], also known as Sri Darbar Sahib or [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]], (on account of its scenic beauty and golden coating for English speaking world), is named after [[Hari]] (God) the temple of God. The Sikhs all over the world, daily wish to pay visit to Sri Amritsar and to pay obeisance at Sri Harmandir Sahib in their [[Ardās|Ardas]].

[[Guru Arjan]]'s father [[Guru Ram Das]] founded the town named after him "Ramdaspur", around a large man-made water pool called "Ramdas Sarovar". Guru Arjan continued the infrastructure building effort of his father. The town expanded during the time of Guru Arjan, financed by donations and constructed by voluntary work. The pool area grew into a temple complex with the [[gurdwara]] [[Harmandir Sahib]] near the pool. Guru Arjan installed the scripture of Sikhism inside the new temple in 1604.&lt;ref name="ShackleMandair2013xv"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Shackle|author2=Arvind Mandair|title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvoJV8mw0LwC |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-45101-0|pages=xv–xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city that emerged is now known as [[Amritsar]], and is the holiest pilgrimage site in Sikhism.&lt;ref name="ShackleMandair2013xv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLeod1990p28"&gt;{{cite book|author=W.H.

The '''hot-filament [[ionization gauge]]''', sometimes called a '''hot-filament gauge''' or '''hot-cathode gauge''', is the most widely used low-pressure (vacuum) measuring device for the region from 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; [[Torr (unit)|Torr]]. It is a [[triode]], with the filament being the [[cathode]].

''Note: Principles are mostly the same for hot-cathode ion sources in [[particle accelerator]]s to create electrons.''

== Function ==
A regulated electron current (typically 10&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|mA]]) is emitted from a heated [[Electrical filament|filament]]. The electrons are attracted to the [[Helix|helical]] grid by a DC potential of about +150&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]]. Most of the electrons pass through the [[control grid|grid]] and collide with gas molecules in the enclosed volume, causing a fraction of them to be ionized. The gas ions formed by the electron collisions are attracted to the central ion collector wire by the negative voltage on the collector (typically −30&amp;nbsp;V). Ion currents are on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;mA/[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]. This current is amplified and displayed by a high-gain differential amplifier/[[electrometer]].

This [[ion current]] differs for different gases at the same pressure; that is, a hot-filament ionization gauge is composition-dependent. Over a wide range of [[molecular]] density, however, the ion current from a gas of constant composition is directly proportional to the molecular density of the gas in the gauge.

==Construction==
[[Image:Varian vacuum gauge.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|Tubulated hot-cathode ionization gauge]]
A hot-cathode ionization gauge is composed mainly of three electrodes, all acting as a [[triode]], wherein the [[cathode]] is the filament. The three electrodes are a collector or plate, a [[hot-cathode|filament]], and a [[control grid|grid]]. The collector current is measured in picoamperes by an [[electrometer]]. The filament voltage to ground is usually at a potential of 30 volts, while the grid voltage at 180–210 volts DC, unless there is an optional [[electron bombardment]] feature, by heating the grid, which may have a high potential of approximately 565 volts.
The most common ion gauge is the hot-cathode '''Bayard–Alpert gauge''', with a small collector inside the grid.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. Bayard and D. Alpert, "Extension of the Low Pressure Range of the Ionization Gauge" Rev. Sci. Instrum. '''21''', 571 (1950); doi: 10.1063/1.1745653.&lt;/ref&gt; A glass envelope with an opening to the vacuum can surround the electrodes, but usually the '''nude gauge''' is inserted in the vacuum chamber directly, the pins being fed through a ceramic plate in the wall of the chamber. Hot-cathode gauges can be damaged or lose their calibration if they are exposed to atmospheric pressure or even low vacuum while hot.

Electrons emitted from the filament move several times in back-and-forth movements around the grid before finally entering the grid. During these movements, some electrons collide with a gas molecule to form a pair of an ion and an electron ([[electron ionization]]). The number of these [[ions]] is proportional to the [[number density|gas molecule density]] multiplied by the electron current emitted from the filament, and these ions pour into the collector to form an ion current. Since the gas molecule density is proportional to the pressure, the pressure is estimated by measuring the ion current.

The low-pressure sensitivity of hot-cathode gauges is limited by the photoelectric effect. Electrons hitting the grid produce X-rays that produce photoelectric noise in the ion collector. This limits the range of older hot-cathode gauges to 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; [[Torr]] and the Bayard–Alpert gauges to about 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; Torr. Additional wires at cathode potential in the line of sight between the ion collector and the grid prevent this effect. In the extraction type the ions are not attracted by a wire but by an open cone. As the ions cannot decide which part of the cone to hit, they pass through the hole and form an ion beam. This ion beam can be passed on to a
* [[Faraday cup]],
* [[quadrupole mass analyzer]] with Faraday cup,
* [[microchannel plate detector]] with Faraday cup,
* [[quadrupole mass analyzer]] with microchannel plate detector Faraday cup,
* ion lens and acceleration voltage and directed at a target to form a [[sputtering|sputter gun]]; in this case a valve lets gas into the grid cage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19987">'''Indian Ocean Trade''' has been a key factor in East–West exchanges throughout history. Long distance trade in [[dhows]] and sailboats made it a dynamic zone of interaction between peoples, cultures, and civilizations stretching from [[Java]] in the East to [[Zanzibar]] and [[Mombasa]] in the West. Cities and states on the Indian Ocean rim were Janus-faced. They looked outward to the sea as much as they looked inward to the hinterland.

==Early period==
{{further information|Meluhha}}
There was an extensive maritime trade network operating between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan]] and [[Mesopotamian]] civilizations as early as the middle Harappan Phase (2600-1900 BCE), with much commerce being handled by "middlemen merchants from Dilmun" (modern [[Bahrain]] and [[Failaka]] located in the [[Persian Gulf]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neyland|first=R. S.|year=1992|chapter=The seagoing vessels on Dilmun seals|editor=Keith, D.H. |editor2=Carrell T.L. (eds.)|title=Underwater archaeology proceedings of the Society for Historical Archaeology Conference at Kingston, Jamaica 1992|pages=68–74|location=Tucson, AZ|publisher=Society for Historical Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such long-distance sea trade became feasible with the development of plank-built watercraft, equipped with a single central mast supporting a sail of woven rushes or cloth.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Several coastal settlements like Sotkagen-dor (astride Dasht River, north of Jiwani), [[Sokhta Koh]] (astride Shadi River, north of [[Pasni City|Pasni]]), and Balakot (near Sonmiani) in Pakistan along with Lothal in western India, testify to their role as Harappan trading outposts. Shallow harbours located at the estuaries of rivers opening into the sea allowed brisk maritime trade with Mesopotamian cities.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Hellenic Period==
Prior to Roman expansion, the various peoples of the subcontinent had established strong maritime trade with other countries. The dramatic increase in South Asian ports, however, did not occur until the opening of the Red Sea by the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Greeks]] and the Romans and the attainment of geographical knowledge concerning the region’s seasonal monsoons. In fact, the first two centuries of the Common Era indicate this increase in trade between present-day western India and Rome. This expansion of trade was due to the comparative peace established by the Roman Empire during the time of Augustus (23 September 63 BC – 19 August AD 14), which allowed for new explorations. 

==Roman period==
{{Main|Roman trade with India}}

[[Image:Borobudur ship.JPG|thumb|Relief panel of a ship at [[Borobudur]], 8th–9th century.]]
The replacement of [[Greece]] by the Roman empire as the administrator of the [[Mediterranean]] basin led to the strengthening of direct maritime trade with the east and the elimination of the taxes extracted previously by the middlemen of various land-based trading routes.&lt;ref name=Lach1&gt;Lach 1994: 13&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo's mention of the vast increase in trade following the Roman annexation of Egypt indicates that monsoon was known and manipulated for trade in his time.&lt;ref&gt;Young 2001: 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade started by [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] in 130 BCE kept increasing, and according to Strabo (II.5.12.), writing some 150 years later:&lt;ref name=Strabo1&gt;{{cite web| title = The Geography of Strabo published in Vol. I of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1917|url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|At any rate, when [[Cornelius Gallus|Gallus]] was prefect of Egypt, I accompanied him and ascended the [[Nile]] as far as [[Aswan|Syene]] and the frontiers of [[Kingdom of Aksum]] ([[Ethiopia]]), and I learned that as many as one hundred and twenty vessels were sailing from [[Myos Hormos]] to the subcontinent, whereas formerly, under the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemies]], only a very few ventured to undertake the voyage and to carry on traffic in Indian merchandise.|Strabo}}

By the time of Augustus up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from [[Myos Hormos]] to India.&lt;ref name=Strabo1/&gt; So much gold was used for this trade, and apparently recycled by the [[Kushan Empire]] (Kushans) for their own coinage, that [[Pliny the Elder]] (NH VI.101) complained about the drain of specie to India:&lt;ref&gt;"minimaque computatione miliens centena milia sestertium annis omnibus India et Seres et paeninsula illa imperio nostro adimunt: tanti nobis deliciae et feminae constant. quota enim portio ex illis ad deos, quaeso, iam vel ad inferos pertinet?" Pliny, Historia Naturae 12.41.84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman ports===
The three main Roman ports involved with eastern trade were [[Arsinoe (Gulf of Suez)|Arsinoe]], [[Berenice Troglodytica|Berenice]] and [[Myos Hormos]]. Arsinoe was one of the early trading centers but was soon overshadowed by the more easily accessible Myos Hormos and Berenice.

====Arsinoe====
[[File:Egypt-region-map-cities-2.gif|thumb|260px|right|Sites of Egyptian Red Sea ports, including Alexandria and Berenice.]]
The Ptolemaic dynasty exploited the strategic position of [[Alexandria]] to secure trade with the subcontinent.&lt;ref name=Lindsay1&gt;Lindsay 2006: 101&lt;/ref&gt; The course of trade with the east then seems to have been first through the harbor of Arsinoe, the present day [[Suez]].&lt;ref name=Lindsay1/&gt; The goods from the [[East Africa]]n trade were landed at one of the three main Roman ports, Arsinoe, Berenice or Myos Hormos.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary 2001: 72&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans repaired and cleared out the silted up canal from the Nile to harbor center of Arsinoe on the Red Sea.&lt;ref name=Fayle1&gt;Fayle 2006: 52&lt;/ref&gt;  This was one of the many efforts the Roman administration had to undertake to divert as much of the trade to the maritime routes as possible.&lt;ref name=Fayle1/&gt;

Arsinoe was eventually overshadowed by the rising prominence of Myos Hormos.&lt;ref name=Fayle1/&gt; The navigation to the northern ports, such as Arsinoe-Clysma, became difficult in comparison to Myos Hormos due to the northern winds in the [[Gulf of Suez]].&lt;ref name=Freeman1&gt;Freeman 2003: 72&lt;/ref&gt; Venturing to these northern ports presented additional difficulties such as [[shoals]], [[reef]]s and treacherous [[Ocean current|currents]].&lt;ref name=Freeman1/&gt;

====Myos Hormos and Berenice====
Myos Hormos and Berenice appear to have been important ancient trading ports, possibly used by the [[Pharaonic]] traders of ancient Egypt and the Ptolemaic dynasty before falling into Roman control.&lt;ref name=Shaw1&gt;Shaw 2003: 426&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of Berenice, since its discovery by Belzoni (1818), has been equated  with the ruins near [[Ras Banas]] in Southern Egypt.&lt;ref name=Shaw1/&gt; However, the precise location of Myos Hormos is disputed with the latitude and longitude given in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' favoring Abu Sha'ar and the accounts given in [[classical literature]] and [[satellite images]] indicating a probable identification with Quseir el-Quadim at the end of a fortified road from [[Koptos]] on the [[Nile]].&lt;ref name=Shaw1/&gt; The Quseir el-Quadim site has further been associated with Myos Hormos following the excavations at el-Zerqa, halfway along the route, which have revealed [[ostraca]] leading to the conclusion that the port at the end of this road may have been Myos Hormos.&lt;ref name=Shaw1/&gt;

===Major regional ports===
[[File:ArikameduRomanCeramic.jpg|thumb|Roman piece of pottery from [[Arezzo]], [[Latium]], found at Virampatnam, [[Arikamedu]] (1st century CE). [[Musee Guimet]].]]
The regional ports of [[Barbarikon|Barbaricum]] (modern [[Karachi]]), [[Wari-Bateshwar|Sounagoura]] (central [[Bangladesh]]) [[Bharuch|Barygaza]], Muziris in Kerala,  [[Korkai]], [[Kaveripattinam]] and [[Arikamedu]] on the southern tip of present-day India were the main centers of this trade, along with [[Kodumanal]], an inland city. The [[Periplus Maris Erythraei]] describes Greco-Roman merchants selling in Barbaricum "thin clothing, figured linens, [[topaz]], [[coral]], [[storax]], [[frankincense]], vessels of glass, silver and gold plate, and a little wine" in exchange for "[[costus]], [[bdellium]], [[boxthorn|lycium]], [[spikenard|nard]], [[turquoise]], [[lapis lazuli]], Seric skins, cotton cloth, [[silk]] yarn, and [[indigo dye|indigo]]".&lt;ref name=Periplus1/&gt; In Barygaza, they would buy wheat, rice, sesame oil, cotton and cloth.&lt;ref name=Periplus1/&gt;

====Barigaza====
Trade with Barigaza, under the control of the [[Indo-Scythian]] [[Western Satrap]] [[Nahapana]] ("Nambanus"), was especially flourishing:&lt;ref name=Periplus1&gt;{{cite web| last = Halsall | first = Paul | title = Ancient History Sourcebook: The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century| publisher = Fordham University| url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There are imported into this market-town ([[Barigaza]]), wine, Italian preferred, also Laodicean and Arabian; copper, tin, and lead; coral and topaz; thin clothing and inferior sorts of all kinds; bright-colored girdles a cubit wide; storax, sweet clover, flint glass, realgar, antimony, gold and silver coin, on which there is a profit when exchanged for the money of the country; and ointment, but not very costly and not much. And for the King there are brought into those places very costly vessels of silver, singing boys, beautiful maidens for the harem, fine wines, thin clothing of the finest weaves, and the choicest ointments. There are exported from these places spikenard, costus, bdellium, ivory, agate and carnelian, lycium, cotton cloth of all kinds, silk cloth, mallow cloth, yarn, long pepper and such other things as are brought here from the various market-towns. Those bound for this market-town from Egypt make the voyage favorably about the month of July, that is Epiphi.|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (paragraph 49).&lt;/small&gt;}}

====Muziris====
[[File:TabulaPeutingerianaMuziris.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Muziris, as shown in the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]], with a "Templum Augusti".]]
[[Muziris]] is a lost port city on the south-western coast of India which was a major center of trade in the ancient Tamil land between the Chera kingdom and the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news | title = Search for India's ancient city| publisher = BBC| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4970452.stm | date=11 June 2006 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its location is generally identified with modern-day [[Cranganore]] (central Kerala).&lt;ref&gt;George Menachery, Kodungallur City of St. Thomas,Azhikode,1987alias Kodungallur Cradle of Christianity in India, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090803/jsp/frontpage/story_11313800.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; Large hoards of coins and innumerable shards of [[amphora]]e found at the town of [[Pattanam]] (near Cranganore) have elicited recent archeological interest in finding a probable location of this port city.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

====Arikamedu====
The [[Periplus Maris Erythraei]] mentions a marketplace named Poduke (ch. 60), which [[G.W.B. Huntingford]] identified as possibly being [[Arikamedu]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], a centre of [[Early Cholas|early Chola]] trade (now part of [[Ariyankuppam]]), about {{convert|3|km|mi}} from the modern [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]].&lt;ref name=Huntingford1&gt;Huntingford 1980: 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Huntingford further notes that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937, and [[archeology|archeological]] excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was "a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century AD".&lt;ref name=Huntingford1/&gt;

===Decline and Legacy===
Following the [[Roman-Persian Wars]], the areas under the Roman [[Byzantine Empire]] were captured by [[Khosrow II]] of the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] Sassanian Dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;Farrokh 2007: 252&lt;/ref&gt; but the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]] reconquered them (628). The Arabs, led by [['Amr ibn al-'As]], crossed into Egypt in late 639 or early 640 CE.&lt;ref name=Meri1&gt;Meri 2006: 224&lt;/ref&gt; This advance marked the beginning of the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt]]&lt;ref name=Meri1/&gt; and the fall of ports such as Alexandria,&lt;ref name=Holl&gt;Holl
2003: 9&lt;/ref&gt; used to secure trade with the subcontinent by the Roman world since the Ptolemaic dynasty.&lt;ref name=Lindsay1/&gt;

The decline in trade saw the [[ancient Tamil country]] turn to [[Southeast Asia]] for international trade, where it influenced the native culture to a greater degree than the impressions made on Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Kulke 2004: 106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu-Buddhist period==
The [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]] developed shipping ventures in Southeast Asia.

The 8th century depiction of a wooden double [[outrigger]] and sailed [[Borobudur ship]] in ancient [[Java]] suggests that there were ancient trading links across the Indian Ocean between [[Indonesia]] and [[Madagascar]] and [[East Africa]] sometimes referred to as the 'Cinnamon Route.' The single or double outrigger is a typical feature of vessels of the seafaring [[Austronesian]]s and the most likely vessel used for their voyages and exploration across Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swahiliweb.net/ziff_journal_3_files/ziff2006-04.pdf Borobudur Ship Expedition]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, between 7th to 13th century in Indonesian archipelago flourished the [[Srivijaya]] [[thalassocracy]] empire that rule the maritime trade network in [[maritime Southeast Asia]] and connecting [[India]] and [[China]].

==Muslim period==
During the Muslim period, in which the Muslims had dominated the trade across the Indian Ocean, the [[Gujaratis]] were bringing spices from the [[Moluccas]] as well as [[silk]] from [[China]], in exchange for manufactured items such as [[textiles]], and then selling them to the Egyptians and Arabs.&lt;ref name="Diffie"&gt;''Foundations of the Portuguese empire, hi lo millo1415–1580'' Bailey Wallys Diffie p.234''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&amp;pg=PA236]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] was the center of Indian [[black pepper|pepper]] exports to the [[Red Sea]] and [[Europe]] at this time&lt;ref name="Diffie"/&gt; with Egyptian and Arab traders being particularly active.&lt;ref name="Diffie"/&gt;

In Madagascar, merchants and slave traders from the Middle East (Shirazi Persians, Omani Arabs, Arabized Jews, accompanied by Bantus from southeast Africa) and from Asia ([[Gujaratis]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Bugis]]) were sometimes integrated within the indigenous Malagasy clans &lt;ref&gt;Larson, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;{{cite book | last = Larson | first = Pier M. | year = 2000 | title = History and Memory in the Age of Enslavement.

Chinese fleets under [[Zheng He]] criscrossed the Indian Ocean during the early part of the 15th century. The missions were diplomatic rather than commercial, but many exchanges of gift and produces were made.

==Portuguese period==
{{Further|Portuguese India|Cape Route}}
The Portuguese under [[Vasco da Gama]] discovered a naval route to the Indian Ocean through the southern tip of [[Africa]] in 1497–98. Initially, the Portuguese were mainly active in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], but the northern region of [[Gujarat]] was even more important for trade, and an essential intermediary in east-west trade.&lt;ref name="Diffie"/&gt;

[[Image:Anonymous Venetian orientalist painting, The Reception of the Ambassadors in Damascus', 1511, the Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|Reception of Venetian ambassadors in [[Damascus]] in the time of [[Qaitbay]].]]
Venetian interests were directly threatened as the traditional trade patterns were eliminated and the Portuguese became able to undersell the Venetians in the spice trade in Europe. Venice broke diplomatic relations with Portugal and started to look at ways to counter its intervention in the Indian Ocean, sending an ambassador to the Egyptian court.&lt;ref name="Diffie230"&gt;''Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415–1580'' Bailey Wallys Diffie p.230''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&amp;pg=PA230]&lt;/ref&gt; Venice negotiated for Egyptian tariffs to be lowered to facilitate competition with the Portuguese, and suggested that "rapid and secret remedies" be taken against the Portuguese.&lt;ref name="Diffie230"/&gt; The Mamluks sent a fleet in 1507 under [[Amir Husain Al-Kurdi]], which would fight in the [[Battle of Chaul]].&lt;ref name="Diffie230"/&gt;

The Ottomans tried to challenge Portugal's hegemony in the Persian Gulf region by sending an armada against the Portuguese under Ali Bey in 1581. They were supported in this endeavor by the chiefs of several local principalities and port towns such as [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Gwadar]], and [[Pasni (city)|Pasni]]. However, the Portuguese successfully [[Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts (1580–89)|intercepted and destroyed the Ottoman Armada]]. Subsequently, the Portuguese attacked Gwadar and Pasni on the [[Mekran]] Coast and sacked them in retaliation for providing aid and comfort to the enemy.

==Dutch and English period==
[[File:Fortress of Hormuz.jpg|thumb|The island of Hormuz was captured by an Anglo-Persian force in the 1622 [[Capture of Ormuz (1622)|Capture of Ormuz]].]]
During the 16th century the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] had established bases in the [[Persian Gulf]]. In 1602, the Iranian army under the command of [[Imam-Quli Khan]] [[Undiladze]] managed to expel the Portuguese from [[Bahrain]]. In 1622, with the help of four English ships, Abbas retook [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]] from the Portuguese in the [[Capture of Ormuz (1622)|capture of Ormuz]]. He replaced it as a trading centre with a new port, [[Bandar Abbas]], nearby on the mainland, but it never became as successful.

==Japanese Trade==
[[Image:JapanesePortolanMap.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese [[Portolan chart|portolan]] sailing map, depicting the [[Indian Ocean]] and the East Asian coast, early 17th century.]]
During the 16th and 17th century, [[Japan]]ese ships also made forays into Indian Ocean trade through the [[Red Seal ship]] 
system.

An '''intermittent energy source''' is any source of [[energy]] that is not continuously available for conversion into [[electricity]] and outside direct control because the used [[primary energy]] cannot be stored. Intermittent energy sources may be predictable but cannot be [[dispatchable generation|dispatched]] to meet the demand of an electric power system.

The use of intermittent sources in an electric power system usually displaces storable primary energy that would otherwise be consumed by other [[power station]]s. Another option is to store electricity generated by non-dispatchable energy sources for later use when needed, e.g. in the form of [[pumped storage]], [[Compressed air energy storage|compressed air]] or in [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. A third option is the [[sector coupling]] e.g. by electric heating for district heating schemes.

The use of small amounts of intermittent power has little effect on [[Electrical grid|grid]] operations. Using larger amounts of intermittent power may require upgrades or even a redesign of the grid infrastructure.&lt;ref name='All_Island_Grid_Overview'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/E20F6E3D-8724-4E39-B315-0670B8C9841E/0/AllIslandGridStudyStudyOverviewJan08a2.pdf |title=All Island Grid Study |accessdate=2008-10-15 |date=January 2008 |pages=3–5, 15 |format=PDF |work=Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231419/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/E20F6E3D-8724-4E39-B315-0670B8C9841E/0/AllIslandGridStudyStudyOverviewJan08a2.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CarbonDTI'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensg.gov.uk/assets/ct_impact_of_re_final_report.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100919181607/http://www.ensg.gov.uk/assets/ct_impact_of_re_final_report.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-09-19 |title=The Carbon Trust &amp; DTI Renewables Network Impacts Study |accessdate=2009-04-22 |date = January 2004 |orig-year=commissioned June 2003 |format=PDF |work=Carbon Trust and UK Department of Trade and Industry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
&lt;!-- [[Nameplate capacity]] redirects here. Please update the redirect if you change the section heading title. --&gt;
Several key terms are useful for understanding the issue of intermittent power sources. These terms are not standardized, and variations may be used. Most of these terms also apply to traditional power plants.

* '''Intermittency''' can mean the extent to which a power source is unintentionally stopped or unavailable, but intermittency is frequently used as synonym of '''variability''',&lt;ref name=GrahamSinden&gt;Graham Sinden, "[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/Downloads/PDF/05/050705TPASindenpres.pdf Assessing the Costs of Intermittent Power Generation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231439/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/Downloads/PDF/05/050705TPASindenpres.pdf |date=2009-03-18 }}", UK Energy Research Centre, 5 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MEFlowBattery&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memagazine.org/backissues/membersonly/oct05/features/rerere/rerere.html |title=renewable. rechargeable. remarkable. |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Kuntz |first=Mark T. |author2=Justin Dawe |year=2005 |work=VRB Power Systems |publisher=Mechanical Engineering |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115212122/http://www.memagazine.org/backissues/membersonly/oct05/features/rerere/rerere.html |archivedate=2009-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the extent to which a power source may exhibit changes in output.&lt;ref name="GrahamSinden"/&gt;
* '''[[Dispatchable generation|Dispatchability]]''' or '''maneuverability''' is the ability of a given power source to increase and decrease output quickly on demand. The concept is distinct from intermittency; dispatchability is one of several ways system operators match supply (generator's output) to system demand (technical loads).&lt;ref name="MEFlowBattery"/&gt;
* '''Penetration''' in this context is generally used to refer to the amount of energy generated as a percentage of annual consumption.&lt;ref name="ieawind.org"&gt;[http://www.ieawind.org/AnnexXXV/Publications/Task25/Task%2025%20Design%20and%20Operation%20of%20Power%20Systems%20UWIG.pdf International Energy Agency Wind Task Force, "Design and Operation of Power Systems with Large Amounts of Wind Power"] Oklahoma Conference Presentation, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nominal power''' or '''[[nameplate capacity]]''' refers to the maximum output of a generating plant in normal operating conditions. This is the most common number used and typically expressed in multiplies of [[Watt]].
* '''[[Capacity factor]]''', '''average capacity factor''', or '''load factor''' is the average expected output of a generator, usually over an annual period. Expressed as a percentage of the nameplate capacity or in decimal form (e.g. 30% or 0.30).
* '''[[Capacity credit]]''': generally the amount of output from a power source that may be statistically relied upon, practically the minimum power within a longer period, usually expressed as a percentage of the nominal power.&lt;ref name='WindCC'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejournal.windeng.net/3/01/GGiebel-CapCredLit_WindEngEJournal_2005_right_links.pdf |title=WIND POWER HAS A CAPACITY CREDIT |accessdate=2008-10-16 |last=Giebel |first=Gregor |format=PDF |work=Risø National Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Firm capacity''' the amount of power that can be guaranteed to be provided as [[base power]]
* '''Non-firm capacity''' the amount of power above the firm capacity that is usually to be sold at higher price on the [[spot market]]

==Intermittency of various power sources==

===Solar energy===
{{See also|Solar power}}
[[File:SolarStirlingEngine.jpg|thumb|[[Solar thermal energy#Dish designs|Dish Stirling]]]]
[[File:ATTParkannualoutput.png|250px|thumb|right|Seasonal variation of the output of the solar panels at AT&amp;T park in San Francisco]]

Intermittency inherently affects solar energy, as the production of renewable electricity from solar sources depends on the amount of sunlight at a given place and time.  Solar output varies throughout the day and through the seasons, and is affected by dust, fog, cloud cover, frost or snow.  Many of the seasonal factors are fairly predictable, and some solar thermal systems make use of heat storage to produce grid power for a full day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com.es/2011/10/25/gemasolar_energia_non_stop.html Gemasolar, energía non stop] Spanish 26 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Intermittency:''' In the absence of an [[energy storage system]], solar does not produce power at night or in bad weather and varies between summer and winter. When intended to produce electricity only for peak [[air conditioning]] loads in the summer, there is no intermittency; in the winter can be complemented with wind power for peak loads.

The impact of intermittency of solar-generated electricity will depend on the correlation of generation with demand. For example, solar thermal power plants such as [[Nevada Solar One]] are somewhat matched to summer peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States. Thermal energy storage systems like the small Spanish [[Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant]] can improve the match between solar supply and local consumption. The improved capacity factor using thermal storage represents a decrease in maximum capacity, and extends the total time the system generates power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/impagr/cip/pdf/issue36SolarP.pdf Spain Pioneers Grid-Connected Solar-Tower Thermal Power] p. 3.

Wind-generated power is a variable resource, and the amount of electricity produced at any given point in time by a given plant will depend on wind speeds, air density, and turbine characteristics (among other factors). If wind speed is too low (less than about 2.5&amp;nbsp;m/s) then the wind turbines will not be able to make electricity, and if it is too high (more than about 25&amp;nbsp;m/s) the turbines will have to be shut down to avoid damage.  While the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary, as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable.&lt;ref name="IEA2005WindVar"/&gt;&lt;ref name=connect/&gt;&lt;ref name=Archer2007/&gt;&lt;ref name = Diesendorf&gt;{{cite journal| author = Diesendorf, Mark |year= 2007| title =Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy|page =119| quote =Graham Sinden analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from 66 sites spread out over the United Kingdom.

* '''[[Reliability engineering|Reliability]]:''' A wind farm has high technical reliability when the wind blows. That is, the output at any given time will only vary gradually due to falling wind speeds or storms (the latter necessitating shut downs). A typical wind farm is unlikely to have to shut down in less than half an hour at the extreme, whereas an equivalent sized power station can fail totally instantaneously and without warning. The total shut down of wind turbines is predictable via weather forecasting. The average availability of a wind turbine is 98%, and when a turbine fails or is shutdown for maintenance it only affects a small percentage of the output of a large wind farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iset.uni-kassel.de/abt/FB-I/publication/2006-02-09Reliability.pdf Reliability of Wind Turbines]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Wind power forecasting|Predictability]]:''' Although wind is variable, it is also predictable in the short term. There is an 80% chance that wind output will change less than 10% in an hour and a 40% chance that it will change 10% or more in 5&amp;nbsp;hours.

According to a 2007 study of wind in the United States, ten or more widely separated wind farms connected through the grid could be relied upon for from 33 to 47% of their average output (15–20% of nominal capacity) as reliable, [[Base load power plant|baseload]] power, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.&lt;ref name=connect&gt;{{cite web

Wind power is affected by air temperature because colder air is more dense and therefore more effective at producing wind power.  As a result, wind power is affected seasonally (more output in winter than summer) and by daily temperature variations.

Several authors have said that no energy resource is totally reliable.

The remaining U.S. nuclear plants produce approximately 90% of their full-time full-load potential, but even they must shut down (on average) for 39 days every 17 months for scheduled refueling and maintenance.&lt;ref name=al2009 /&gt; To cope with such intermittence by nuclear (and centralized fossil-fuelled) power plants, utilities install a "reserve margin" of roughly 15% extra capacity spinning ready for instant use.&lt;ref name=al2009 /&gt;

The intermittency and variability of renewable energy sources can be reduced and accommodated by diversifying their technology type and geographical location, forecasting their variation, and integrating them with dispatchable renewables (such as hydropower, geothermal, and biomass).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 2009, eight American and three European authorities, writing in the leading electrical engineers' professional journal, didn't find "a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electricity grids". In fact, not one of more than 200 international studies, nor official studies for the eastern and western U.S. regions, nor the [[International Energy Agency]], has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30% variable renewable supplies into the grid, and in some studies much more.&lt;ref name=Lovins11/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A research group at Harvard University quantified the meteorologically defined limits to reduction in the variability of outputs from a coupled wind farm system in the Central US:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The problem with the output from a single wind farm located in any particular region is that it is variable on time scales ranging from minutes to days posing difficulties for incorporating relevant outputs into an integrated power system. The high frequency (shorter than once per day) variability of contributions from individual wind farms is determined mainly by locally generated small scale boundary layer. The low frequency variability (longer than once per day) is associated with the passage of transient waves in the atmosphere with a characteristic time scale of several days. The high frequency variability of wind-generated power can be significantly reduced by coupling outputs from 5 to 10 wind farms distributed uniformly over a ten state region of the Central US. More than 95% of the remaining variability of the coupled system is concentrated at time scales longer than a day, allowing operators to take advantage of multi-day weather forecasts in scheduling projected contributions from wind.&lt;ref&gt;name="Junling"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Junling Huang |author2=Michael B.

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]] has studied how wind, water and solar technologies can be integrated to provide the majority of the world's energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Galbraith. [http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/100-percent-renewables-by-2030/ 100 Percent Renewables by 2030?] ''Green Inc.'', December 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He advocates a "smart mix" of [[renewable energy]] sources to reliably meet electricity demand:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind, combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand, especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Z. Jacobson and Mark A. Delucchi. A Path to Sustainable Energy by 2030, ''Scientific American'', November 2009, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mark A. Delucchi and Mark Z. Jacobson argue that there are at least seven ways to design and operate renewable energy systems so that they will reliably satisfy electricity demand:&lt;ref name=jacob2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part II: Reliability, System andTransmission Costs, and Policies |author=Delucchi, Mark A. and [[Mark Z.

{{ordered list|list-style-type= upper-alpha
| Interconnect geographically dispersed, technologically diverse renewable generation types (such as wind, solar, and tidal) to smooth out daily supply variability. For example, solar power generation is highest at midday, and wind is often strongest at night and early morning. The combined solar-wind resource has lower variance than either individual source.
| Use dispatchable renewable energy generators (such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass) to fill energy deficits between demand and intermittent resource generation.
| Use demand response (or demand-side management) to shift flexible loads to a time when more renewable energy is available, and away from times when renewable generation is low. This requires that loads be capable of receiving and responding to price or control signals from the local utility or grid operator.
| Store excess renewable power, which would otherwise be curtailed, for later use at times when generation is not sufficient to meet load. Some energy storage technology types include pumped hydro, electrochemical batteries, flywheels, compressed air, and hydrogen. These energy storage resources can be located near intermittent generation, “behind the meter” at homes and business, or at any other point on the electric grid. Customer-sited storage is typically used to increase self-consumption of distributed energy resources such as photovoltaic panels, to shift grid power consumption towards off-peak hours, and to reduce demand charges. Grid-scale storage is typically used to provide ancillary services to the grid, such as frequency regulation, synchronous “spinning” reserve capacity, and load-following.
| Over-size renewable peak generation capacity to minimize the times when available renewable power is less than demand, and to provide spare power to produce hydrogen for flexible transportation and heat uses.
| Use electric vehicles as an additional storage resource. The first generation of this technology, known as V1G (unidirectional managed charging), involves “smart charging” at times when the grid can accommodate additional load, with power only flowing into the vehicle. A further development, known as V2B (vehicle-to-building), sees bidirectional power flow into the vehicle at optimal times, and out of the vehicle to meet building demand. The most advanced form, known as V2G ([[Vehicle-to-grid]]), sees power exported from the EV back on to the grid when needed.

Technological solutions to mitigate large-scale wind energy type intermittency exist such as increased interconnection (the [[European super grid]]), [[Demand response]], [[load management]], [[diesel generators]] (in the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|British National Grid]], Frequency Response / [[National Grid Reserve Service]] type schemes, and use of existing power stations on standby.

Matching power demand to supply is not a problem specific to intermittent power sources. Existing power grids already contain elements of uncertainty including sudden and large changes in demand and unforeseen power plant failures. Though power grids are already designed to have some capacity in excess of projected peak demand to deal with these problems, significant upgrades may be required to accommodate large amounts of intermittent power.   The [[International Energy Agency| International Energy Agency (IEA)]] states:
"In the case of wind power, operational reserve is the additional generating reserve needed to ensure that differences between forecast and actual volumes of generation and demand can be met. Again, it has to be noted that already significant amounts of this reserve are operating on the grid due to the general safety and quality demands of the grid. Wind imposes additional demands only inasmuch as it increases variability and unpredictability. However, these factors are nothing completely new to system operators. By adding another variable, wind power changes the degree of uncertainty, but not the kind..."&lt;ref name='IEA2005WindVar'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/Papers/2005/variability.pdf |title=Variability of Wind Power and other Renewables: Management Options and Strategies |accessdate=2008-10-15 |work=IEA |year=2005 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With sufficient energy storage, highly variable and intermittent sources can supply all of a regions electrical power. For solar to provide half of all electricity and using a solar capacity factor of 20%, the total capacity for solar would be 250% of the grids average daily load. For wind to provide half of all electricity and using a wind capacity factor of 30% the total capacity for wind would be 160% of the grids average daily load.

A pumped storage facility would then store enough water for the grids weekly load, with a capacity for peak demand i.e.:200% of the grid average. This would allow for one week of overcast and windless conditions. There are unusual costs associated with building storage and total generating capacity being six times the grid average.

==Compensating for variability==
{{See also|Electric power transmission}}

All sources of electrical power have some degree of variability, as do demand patterns which routinely drive large swings in the amount of electricity that suppliers feed into the grid. Wherever possible, grid operations procedures are designed to match supply with demand at high levels of reliability, and the tools to influence supply and demand are well-developed. The introduction of large amounts of highly variable power generation may require changes to existing procedures and additional investments.

The capacity of a reliable [[renewable energy|renewable power]] supply, can be fulfilled by the use of [[Redundancy (engineering)|backup or extra infrastructure and technology]], using mixed renewables to produce electricity [[Fault-tolerant design|above the intermittent average]], which may be used to meet regular and unanticipated supply demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/print/article/2011/02/solar-solar-and-energy-storage-a-perfect-match|title=Solar and Energy Storage: A Perfect Match - Energy Storage to the Test|publisher=RenewableEnergyWorld.com|accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the storage of energy to fill the shortfall intermittency or for emergencies can be part of a [[Reliability engineering|reliable]] power supply.

===Operational reserve===
{{See also|National Grid Reserve Service}}

All managed grids already have existing operational and "spinning" reserve to compensate for existing uncertainties in the power grid. The addition of intermittent resources such as wind does not require 100% "back-up" because operating reserves and balancing requirements are calculated on a system-wide basis, and not dedicated to a specific generating plant.

* Some coal, gas, or hydro power  plants are partially loaded and then controlled to change as demand changes or to replace rapidly lost generation. The ability to change as demand changes is termed "response."  The ability to quickly replace lost generation, typically within timescales of 30&amp;nbsp;seconds to 30&amp;nbsp;minutes, is termed "spinning reserve."
* Generally thermal plants running as [[Peaking power plant|peaking plants]] will be less efficient than if they were running as [[Base load power plant|base load]].
* Hydroelectric facilities with storage capacity (such as the traditional dam configuration) may be operated as base load or peaking plants.
* In practice, as the power output from wind varies, partially loaded conventional plants, which are already present to provide response and reserve, adjust their output to compensate.
* While low penetrations of intermittent power may use existing levels of response and spinning reserve, the larger overall variations at higher penetrations levels will require additional reserves or other means of compensation.

===Demand reduction or increase===
* [[Demand response]] refers to the use of communication and switching devices which can release deferrable loads quickly, or absorb additional energy to correct supply/demand imbalances. Incentives have been widely  created in the American, British and French systems for the use of these systems, such as favorable rates or capital cost assistance, encouraging consumers with large loads to take them off line or to start diesels whenever there is a shortage of capacity, or conversely to increase load when there is a surplus.
* Certain types of load control allow the power company to turn loads off remotely if insufficient power is available. In France large users such as CERN cut power usage as required by the System Operator - EDF under the encouragement of the EJP tariff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claverton-energy.com/how-cern-is-encouraged-to-not-do-atom-or-quark-smashing-during-periods-of-high-demand-and-low-power-station-availablity-by-means-of-the-ejp-tarrif.html - Extract from CERN newsletter indication when to switch of loads&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/42/ description of EJP tariff {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208120416/http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/42/ |date=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Energy demand management]] refers to incentives to adjust use of electricity, such as higher rates during peak hours.
* Real-time variable electricity pricing can encourage users to adjust usage to take advantage of periods when power is cheaply available and avoid periods when it is more scarce and expensive.&lt;ref name=CaliPolicy&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005_energypolicy/index.html| title=2005 Integrated Energy Policy Report| date=November 21, 2005| publisher=California Energy Commission| accessdate=2006-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Instantaneous demand reduction.  Most large systems also have a category of loads which instantly disconnect when there is a generation shortage, under some mutually beneficial contract.  This can give instant load reductions (or increases).  See [[National Grid Reserve Service]]
* Diesel generators, originally or primarily installed for emergency power supply are often also connected to the National Grid in the UK to help deal with short term demand supply mismatches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claverton-energy.com/commercial-opportunities-for-back-up-generation-and-load-reduction-via-national-grid-the-national-electricity-transmission-system-operator-netso-for-england-scotland-wales-and-offshore.html Commercial Opportunities for Back-Up Generation and Load Reduction via National Grid, the National Electricity Transmission System Operator (NETSO) for England, Scotland, Wales and Offshore.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage and demand loading===
{{Main|Grid energy storage}}

At times of low load where non-dispatchable output from wind and solar may be high, grid stability requires lowering the output of various dispatchable generating sources or even increasing controllable loads, possibly by using energy storage to time-shift output to times of higher demand. Such mechanisms can include:

* [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|Pumped storage hydropower]] is the most prevalent existing technology used, and can substantially improve the economics of wind power. The availability of hydropower sites suitable for storage will vary from grid to grid.  Typical round trip efficiency is 80%.&lt;ref name="IEA2005WindVar"/&gt;&lt;ref name='REPAWindEconomics'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/rep/wpaper/2006-02.html |title=The Economics of Wind Power with Energy Storage |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Benitez |first=Pablo C. |author2=Lilianna E. Dragulescu |author3=G. Cornelis Van Kooten  |date = February 2006|work=Resource Economics and Policy Analysis (REPA) Research Group |publisher=Department of Economics, University of Victoria }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thermal energy storage]] stores heat. Stored heat can be used directly for heating needs or converted into electricity. In the context of a CHP plant a heat storage can serve as a functional electricity storage at comparably low costs. 
* [[Ice storage air conditioning]] Ice can be stored inter seasonally and can be used as a source of air-conditioning during periods of high demand. Present systems only need to store ice for a few hours but are well developed.
* [[Hydrogen]] can be created through [[electrolysis]] and stored for later use.  [[NREL]] found that a kilogram of hydrogen (roughly equivalent to a gallon of gasoline) could be produced for between US$5.55 in the near term and $2.27 in the long term.&lt;ref name='NRELElectrolysis'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39534.pdf |title=Wind Energy and Production of Hydrogen and Electricity - Opportunities for Renewable Hydrogen - Preprint |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Levene |first=J. |author2=B. Kroposki |author3=G. Sverdrup  |date = March 2006|format=PDF |work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rechargeable [[Flow battery|flow batteries]] can serve as a large capacity, rapid-response storage medium.&lt;ref name="MEFlowBattery"/&gt;
* Traditional lithium-ion batteries have a large environmental footprint, but  new technologies such as air-breathing batteries could provide an enviro-friendly solution to renewable energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enviro-news.com/news/air-breathing-battery-renewable-energy-storage-solution.html|title=Air-Breathing Battery Renewable Energy Storage Solution |publisher=Enviro-News.com|date=August 3, 2012&lt;!--, 7:40AM BST--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some loads such as desalination plants, electric boilers and industrial refrigeration units, are able to store their output (water and heat). These "opportunistic loads" are able to take advantage of "burst electricity" when it is available.
* Various other potential applications are being considered, such as charging plug-in electric vehicles during periods of low demand and high production; such technologies are not widely used at this time.

Storage of electrical energy results in some lost energy because storage and retrieval are not perfectly efficient. Storage may also require substantial capital investment and space for storage facilities.

===Geographic diversity===
The variability of production from a single wind turbine can be high. Combining any additional number of turbines (for example, in a wind farm) results in lower statistical variation, as long as the [[correlation]] between the output of each turbine is imperfect, and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine. Similarly, geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations, reducing overall variability. Since wind power is dependent on weather systems, there is a limit to the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;name="Junling"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Junling Huang |author2=Michael B. McElroy |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148113003674|title=Meteorologically defined limits to reduction in the variability of outputs from a coupled wind farm system in the Central US|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=62 |pages=331–340 |year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2013.07.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple wind farms spread over a wide geographic area and gridded together produce power more constantly and with less variability than smaller installations. [[Wind power forecasting|Wind output can be predicted]] with some degree of confidence using weather forecasts, especially from large numbers of turbines/farms. The ability to predict wind output is expected to increase over time as data is collected, especially from newer facilities.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

===Complementary power sources and matching demand===
In the past electrical generation was mostly dispatchable and consumer demand led how much and when to dispatch power. The trend in adding intermittent sources such as wind, solar, and run-of-river hydro means the grid is beginning to be led by the intermittent supply. The use of intermittent sources relies on electric power grids that are carefully managed, for instance using highly dispatchable generation that is able to shut itself down whenever an intermittent source starts to generate power, and to successfully startup without warning when the intermittents stop generating.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Energy: [https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/01/f34/Maintaining%20Reliability%20in%20the%20Modern%20Power%20System.pdf Maintaining Reliability in the Modern Power System], December 2016, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally the capacity of the intermittents would grow to be larger than consumer demand for periods of time, creating excess low price electricity to displace heating fuels or be converted to [[Energy storage|mechanical or chemical storage]] for later use.

The displaced dispatchable generation could be coal, natural gas, biomass, nuclear, geothermal or storage hydro. Rather than starting and stopping nuclear or geothermal it is cheaper to use them as constant [[base load]] power. Any power generated in excess of demand can displace heating fuels, be converted to storage or sold to another grid. Biofuels and conventional hydro can be saved for later when intermittents are not generating power. [[Fossil fuel phase-out|Alternatives to burning]] coal and natural gas which produce fewer [[greenhouse gas]]es may eventually make fossil fuels a [[stranded asset]] that is left in the ground. Highly integrated grids favor flexibility and performance over cost, resulting in more plants that operate for fewer hours and lower [[capacity factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Richard: [https://www.treehugger.com/renewable-energy/death-capacity-factor-how-wind-solar-ultimately-win-game.html Death by 'capacity factor': Is this how wind and solar ultimately win the game?], 2015-10-06&lt;/ref&gt;

* Electricity produced from solar energy tends to counterbalance the fluctuating supplies generated from wind.  Normally it is windiest at night and during cloudy or stormy weather, and there is more sunshine on clear days with less wind.&lt;ref name='AtlanticFragility'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmi.org/images/other/EnergySecurity/S83-08_FragileDomEnergy.pdf |title=The Fragility of Domestic Energy |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Lovins |first=Amory |author2=L.

* In some locations, electricity demand may have a high correlation with wind output, particularly in locations where cold temperatures drive electric consumption (as cold air is denser and carries more energy).
* Intermittent solar electricity generation has a direct correlation where hot sunny weather drives high cooling demands. This is an ideal relationship between intermittent energy and demand.
* The allowable penetration may be increased with further investment in standby generation. For instance some days could produce 80% intermittent wind and on the many windless days substitute 80% dispatchable power like natural gas, biomass and Hydro. 
* Areas with existing high levels of [[hydroelectric]] generation may ramp up or down to incorporate substantial amounts of wind. [[Norway]], [[Brazil]], and [[Manitoba]] all have high levels of hydroelectric generation, Quebec produces over 90% of its electricity from hydropower, and [[Hydro-Québec]] is the largest hydropower producer in the world. The U.S. Pacific Northwest has been identified as another region where wind energy is complemented well by existing hydropower, and there were "no fundamental technical barriers" to integrating up to 6,000&amp;nbsp;MW of wind capacity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/20/AR2007032001634.html "Air, Water Powerful Partners in Northwest", Washington Post, March 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Storage capacity in hydropower facilities will be limited by size of reservoir, and environmental and other considerations.
* The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the [[University of Kassel]], [[Germany]] pilot-tested a [[virtual power plant|combined power plant]] linking solar, wind, [[biogas]] and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|hydrostorage]] to provide load-following power around the clock, entirely from renewable sources.&lt;ref name="combined_power_plant"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Export &amp; import arrangements with neighboring systems===
* It is often feasible to export energy to neighboring grids at times of surplus, and import energy when needed. This practice is common in Western Europe and North America.
* Integration with other grids can lower the effective concentration of variable power. Denmark's 44% penetration, in the context of the German/Dutch/[[Governance of hydropower in Scandinavia|Scandinavian grids]] with which it has interconnections, is considerably lower as a proportion of the total system.
* Integration of grids may decrease the overall variability of both supply and demand by increasing geographical diversity.
* Methods of compensating for power variability in one grid, such as peaking-plants or pumped-storage hydro-electricity, may be taken advantage of by importing variable power from another grid that is short on such capabilities.
* The capacity of power transmission infrastructure may have to be substantially upgraded to support export/import plans.
* Some energy is lost in transmission.
* The economic value of exporting variable power depends in part on the ability of the exporting grid to provide the importing grid with useful power at useful times for an attractive price.

==Penetration==
Penetration refers to the proportion of a [[primary energy]] (PE) source in an electric power system, expressed as a percentage.&lt;ref name="ieawind.org"/&gt; There are several methods of calculation yielding different penetrations. The penetration can be calculated either as:&lt;ref name="ukerc2006tpa"/&gt;

# the nominal capacity (installed power) of a PE source divided by the peak load within an electric power system; or
# the nominal capacity (installed power) of a PE source divided by the total capacity of the electric power system; or
# the electrical energy generated by a PE source in a given period, divided by the demand of the electric power system in this period.

The level of penetration of intermittent variable sources is significant for the following reasons:

* Power grids with significant amounts of dispatchable [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]], [[hydropower]] with [[reservoir]] or [[pondage]] or other [[peaking power plant]]s such as natural gas-fired power plants are capable of accommodating fluctuations from intermittent power more easily.&lt;ref&gt;http://repa.econ.uvic.ca/publications/Working%20Paper%202006-02.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Relatively small electric power systems without strong interconnection may only be stable and economic with a lower fraction of wind energy (e.g. Ireland), although hybrid wind/diesel and solar/diesel systems have been used in isolated communities with success at relatively high penetration levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/30668.pdf Characterizing the Effects of High Wind Penetration on a Small Isolated Grid in Arctic Alaska]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sma.de/en/newsroom/current-news/news-details/news/4297-photovoltaic-diesel-hybrid-project-with-sma-system-technology-has-gone-into-operation-in-india-4.html Photovoltaic Diesel Hybrid Project With SMA System Technology Has Gone Into Operation In India]: a project with 1,25 MVA diesel genset &amp; 1 MWp PV system, 2013-07-02&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system:&lt;ref name="Lovins11"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 2010, four German states, totaling 10 million people, relied on wind power for 43-52% of their annual electricity needs. Denmark isn't far behind, supplying 22% of its power from wind in 2010 (26% in an average wind year). The Extremadura region of Spain is getting up to 25% of its electricity from solar, while the whole country meets 16% of its demand from wind. Just during 2005-2010, Portugal vaulted from 17% to 45% renewable electricity.&lt;ref name=Lovins11/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no generally accepted maximum level of penetration, as each system's capacity to compensate for intermittency differs, and the systems themselves will change over time. Discussion of acceptable or unacceptable penetration figures should be treated and used with caution, as the relevance or significance will be highly dependent on local factors, grid structure and management, and existing generation capacity.

For most systems worldwide, existing penetration levels are significantly lower than practical or theoretical maximums; for example, a UK study found that "it is clear that intermittent generation need not compromise electricity system reliability at any level of penetration foreseeable in Britain over the next 20 years, although it may increase costs."&lt;ref name="ukerc2006tpa"&gt;{{cite book

===Maximum penetration limits===
There is no generally accepted maximum penetration of wind energy that would be feasible in any given grid. Rather, economic efficiency and cost considerations are more likely to dominate as critical factors; technical solutions may allow higher penetration levels to be considered in future, particularly if cost considerations are secondary.

High penetration scenarios may be feasible in certain circumstances:

* Power generation for periods of little or no wind generation can be provided by retaining the existing power stations. The cost of using existing power stations for this purpose may be low since fuel costs dominate the operating costs.  The actual cost of paying to keep a power station idle, but usable at short notice, may be estimated from published [[spark spread]]s and [[dark spread]]s. As existing traditional plant ages, the cost of replacing or refurbishing these facilities will become part of the cost of high-penetration wind if they are used only to provide operational reserve.
* Automatic load shedding of large industrial loads and its subsequent automatic reconnection is established technology and used in the UK and U.S., and known as [[National Grid Reserve Service|Frequency Service contractors]] in the UK. Several GW are switched off and on each month in the UK in this way. Reserve Service contractors offer [[Peaking power plant|fast response gas turbines]] and even faster diesels in the UK, France and U.S. to control grid stability.
* In a close-to-100% wind scenario, surplus wind power can be allowed for by increasing the levels of the existing Reserve and Frequency Service schemes and by extending the scheme to domestic-sized loads. Energy can be stored by advancing deferrable domestic loads such as storage heaters, water heaters, fridge motors, or even [[hydrogen production]], and load can be shed by turning such equipment off.
* Alternatively or additionally, power can be exported to neighboring grids and re-imported later.  HVDC cables are efficient with 3% loss per 1000&amp;nbsp;km and may be inexpensive in certain circumstances. For example, an 8 GW link from UK to France would cost about £1&amp;nbsp;billion using [[high-voltage direct current]] cables. Under such scenarios, the amount of transmission capacity required may be many times higher than currently available.

===Penetration studies===
Studies have been conducted to assess the viability of specific penetration levels in specific energy markets.

====European super grid====
A series of detailed modelling studies by Dr. Gregor Czisch, which looked at the European wide adoption of renewable energy and interlinking power grids the [[European super grid]] using [[HVDC]] cables, indicates that the entire European power usage could come from renewables, with 70% total energy from wind at the same sort of costs or lower than at present.&lt;ref name="Czisch100Renew"/&gt;  This proposed large European power grid has been called a "[[super grid]]."&lt;ref name='DWWorldGregor'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2105061,00.html |title=Dr. Gregor Czisch's green European "Super Grid"

The model deals with intermittent power issues by using base-load renewables such as hydroelectric and biomass for a substantial portion of the remaining 30% and by heavy use of HVDC to shift power from windy areas to non-windy areas.  The report states that "electricity transport proves to be one of the keys to an economical electricity supply" and underscores the importance of "international co-operation in the field of renewable energy use [and] transmission."&lt;ref name="Czisch100Renew"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EFFECTS OF LARGE-SCALE DISTRIBUTION OF WIND

====Grid study in Ireland====
A study of the grid in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] indicates that it would be feasible to accommodate 42% (of demand) renewables
in the electricity mix.&lt;ref name='IrishPR'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/2008/Study+shows+Ireland+can+be+world+leader+in+renewable+energy.htm |title=Study shows Ireland can be world leader in renewable energy |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=January 2008 |work=Department of Communications, Energy and National Resources |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321220558/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press%2BReleases/2008/Study%2Bshows%2BIreland%2Bcan%2Bbe%2Bworld%2Bleader%2Bin%2Brenewable%2Benergy.htm |archivedate=March 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This acceptable level of renewable penetration was found in what the study called Scenario 5, provided 47% of electrical capacity (different from demand) with the following mix of renewable energies:

* 6,000 MW wind
* 360 MW base load renewables
* 285 MW additional variable renewables (other intermittent sources)

The study cautions that various assumptions were made that "may have understated dispatch restrictions, resulting in an underestimation of operational costs, required wind curtailment, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions" and that "The limitations of the study may overstate the technical feasibility of the portfolios analyzed..."

Scenario 6, which proposed renewables providing 59% of electrical capacity and 54% of demand had problems.  Scenario 6 proposed the following mix of renewable energies:

* 8,000 MW wind
* 392 MW base load renewables
* 1,685 MW additional variable renewables (other intermittent sources)

The study found that for Scenario 6, "a significant number of hours characterized by extreme system situations occurred where load and reserve requirements could not be met.  The results of the network study indicated that for such extreme renewable penetration scenarios, a system re-design is required, rather than a reinforcement exercise."  The study declined to analyze the cost effectiveness of the required changes because "determination of costs and benefits had become extremely dependent on the assumptions made" and this uncertainty would have impacted the robustness of the results.&lt;ref name="All_Island_Grid_Overview"/&gt;

====Canada====
A study published in October 2006, by the Ontario Independent Electric System Operator (IESO) found that "there would be minimal system operation impacts for levels of wind capacity up to 5,000&amp;nbsp;MW," which corresponds to a peak penetration of 17%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ieso.ca/imoweb/pubs/marketreports/OPA-Report-200610-1.pdf| title=Ontario Wind Integration Study| year=2006| publisher=Ontario Independent Electric System Operator| format=PDF| accessdate=2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
A November 2006 analysis, found that "wind power may be able to cover more than 50% of the Danish electricity consumption in 2025" under conditions of high oil prices and higher costs for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allowances.&lt;ref name='Danish_Wind_Env_Full'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens.dk/graphics/Publikationer/Havvindmoeller/havvindmoellebog_nov_2006_skrm.pdf |title=Danish Offshore Wind - Key Environmental Issues |accessdate=2008-10-15 |date = November 2006|format=PDF |work=DONG Energy, Vattenfall, The Danish Energy Authority and the Danish Forest and Nature Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark's two grids (covering West Denmark and East Denmark separately) each incorporate high-capacity interconnectors to neighbouring grids where some of the variations from wind are absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Economic impacts of variability==
Estimates of the cost of wind energy may include estimates of the "external" costs of wind variability, or be limited to the cost of production. All electrical plant has costs that are separate from the cost of production, including, for example, the cost of any necessary transmission capacity or reserve capacity in case of loss of generating capacity. Many types of generation, particularly fossil fuel derived, will also have cost [[externality|externalities]] such as pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and habitat destruction which are generally not directly accounted for. The magnitude of the economic impacts is debated and will vary by location, but is expected to rise with higher penetration levels. At low penetration levels, costs such as [[operating reserve]] and balancing costs are believed to be insignificant.

Intermittency may introduce additional costs that are distinct from or of a different magnitude than for traditional generation types. These may include:

* Transmission capacity: transmission capacity may be more expensive than for nuclear and coal generating capacity due to lower load factors. Transmission capacity will generally be sized to projected peak output, but average capacity for wind will be significantly lower, raising cost per unit of energy actually transmitted. However transmission costs are a low fraction of total energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claverton-energy.com/what-is-the-cost-per-kwh-of-bulk-transmission-national-grid-in-the-uk-note-this-excludes-distribution-costs.html Electric power transmission costs per kWh transmission / National Grid in the UK (note this excludes distribution costs)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Additional operating reserve: if additional wind does not correspond to demand patterns, additional operating reserve may be required compared to other generating types, however this does not result in higher capital costs for additional plants since this is merely existing plants running at low output - spinning reserve. Contrary to statements that all wind must be backed by an equal amount of "back-up capacity", intermittent generators contribute to base capacity "as long as there is some probability of output during peak periods." Back-up capacity is not attributed to individual generators, as back-up or operating reserve "only have meaning at the system level."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,550/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706221755/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/component/option%2Ccom_docman/task%2Cdoc_download/gid%2C550/ |date=2007-07-06 }} The Costs and Impacts of Intermittency, UK Energy Research Council, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Balancing costs: to maintain grid stability, some additional costs may be incurred for balancing of load with demand. The ability of the grid to balance supply with demand will depend on the rate of change of the amount of energy produced (by wind, for example) and the ability of other sources to ramp production up or scale production down. Balancing costs have generally been found to be low.
* Storage, export and load management: at high penetrations (more than 30%),{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} solutions (described below) for dealing with high output of wind during periods of low demand may be required. These may require additional capital expenditures, or result in lower marginal income for wind producers.

===Analyses of costs===
Studies have been performed to determine the costs of variability.  [[RenewableUK]] states:

{{cquote|A review of integration studies, worldwide, suggests that the additional costs of integrating wind are around £2/MWh with 10% wind, rising to £3/MWh with 20% wind.&lt;ref name='BWEAIntegrating'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwea.com/pdf/RAEIntegrationfinal.pdf |title=Integrating renewables |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Ford |first=Richard |author2=David Milborrow |date = February 2005|format=PDF |work=British Wind Energy Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Colorado – separate reports by Xcel and UCS====
An official at [[Xcel Energy]] claimed that at 20 percent penetration, additional standby generators to compensate for wind in Colorado would cost $8 per MWh, adding between 13% and 16% to the US$50–60 cost per MWh of wind energy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/business/28wind.html?pagewanted=all New York Times article on intermittency and penetration, December 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] conducted a study of the costs to increase the renewable penetration in Colorado to 10% and found that for an average residential bill "customers of municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives that opt out of the solar energy requirement" would save 4 cents per month, but that for [[Xcel Energy]] customers there would be additional cost of about 10 cents per month.  Total impact on all consumers would be $4.5 million or 0.01% over two decades.&lt;ref name='UCSColorado37PDF'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_energy/co_ballot_res_report_-_final.pdf |title=The Colorado Renewable Energy Standard Ballot Initiative: Impacts on Jobs and the Economy |accessdate=2008-10-16 |last=Deyette |first=Jeff |author2=Steve Clemmer |date = October 2004|format=PDF |work=Union of Concerned Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='UCSColorado37Web'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/solutions/renewable_energy_solutions/the-colorado-renewable-energy.html |title=The Colorado Renewable Energy Standard Ballot Initiative: Impacts on Jobs and the Economy |accessdate=2008-10-16 |date = October 2004|work=Union of Concerned Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UK studies====
A detailed study for [[UK National Grid]] (a private power company) states "We have estimated that for the case with 8,000&amp;nbsp;MW of wind needed to meet the 10% renewables target for 2010, balancing costs can be expected to increase by around £2 per MWh of wind production. This would represent an additional £40million per annum, just over 10% of existing annual balancing costs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2007/1/28/183633/609 No technical limitation to wind power penetration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NG_7YR_Summary'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/sys_06/print.asp?chap=all |title=GB Seven Year Statement - Executive Summary |accessdate=2008-10-16 |year=2006 |work=National Grid }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In evidence to the UK House of Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee, National Grid have quoted estimates of balancing costs for 40% wind and these lie in the range £500-1000M per annum.  "These balancing costs represent an additional £6 to £12 per annum on average consumer electricity bill of around £390."&lt;ref name='GridToLords'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/EA273%20National%20Grid%20Response%20on%20Economics%20of%20Renewable%20Energy.pdf |title=National Grid's response to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee investigating the economics of renewable energy |accessdate=2008-10-15 |work=National Grid |date=June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910115928/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/EA273%20National%20Grid%20Response%20on%20Economics%20of%20Renewable%20Energy.pdf |archivedate=September 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

National Grid notes that "increasing levels of such renewable generation on the system would increase the costs of balancing the system and managing system frequency."&lt;ref name="NG_7YR_Summary"/&gt;

A 2003 report,&lt;ref name="CarbonDTI"/&gt; by [[Carbon Trust]] and the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)]], projected costs of £1.6 to £2.4 billion for reinforcement and new build of transmission and  distribution systems to support 10% renewable electricity in the UK by 2010, and £3.2bn to £4.5bn for 20% by 2020. The study classified "Intermittency" as "Not a significant issue" for the 2010 target but a "Significant Issue" for the 2020 target. ''See [[grid balancing]]''

====Minnesota====
A Minnesota study on wind penetration levels and found that "total integration operating cost for up to 25% wind energy" would be less than $0.0045 per kWh (additional).&lt;ref name=MinnesotaFull&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwig.org/windrpt_vol%201.pdf |title=Minnesota Wind Integration Study - Full Report |accessdate=2008-10-17 |last=Wolf |first=Ken |author2=Matt Schuerger |date = December 2006|work=Minnesota Public Utilities Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intermittency and renewable energy==
There are differing views about some sources of renewable energy and intermittency.  The [[World Nuclear Association]] argues that the sun, wind, tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous base-load power, or peak-load power when it is needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf10.html Renewable Energy and Electricity]&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of renewable energy use argue that the issue of intermittency of renewables is over-stated, and that practical experience demonstrates this.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, 413 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] [[renewable energy]] has, like nuclear, no intermittency (but they both use the energy in radioactive materials like uranium, thorium and potassium).

===Views of critics of high penetration renewable energy use===
For many years there was a consensus within the electric utilities in the U.S. that renewable electricity generators such as wind and solar are so unreliable and intermittent that they will never be able to contribute significantly to electric supply or provide baseload power. Thomas Petersnik, an analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Administration put it this way: "by and large, renewable energy sources are too rare, too distant, too uncertain, and too ill-timed to provide significant supplies at times and places of need".&lt;ref name="Benjamin Sovacool 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/20526 |title=The intermittency of wind, solar, and renewable electricity generators: Technical barrier or rhetorical excuse? |author=Benjamin Sovacool |date=2009 |journal=Utilities Policy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of proponents of high penetration renewable energy use===
{{See also|Renewable Electricity and the Grid|Energy security and renewable technology}}

The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Jon Wellinghoff has stated that "baseload capacity is going to become an anachronism" and that no new nuclear or coal plants may ever be needed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/a-very-significant-admission-by-the-us-ferc-chairman-that-the-issue-of-integrating-variable-sources-of-power-is-not-such-a-big-issue.html | title=Wind a very significant admission by the US FERC chairman that the issue of integrating variable sources of power is not such a big issue - Power and Reliability: The Roles of Baseload and Variable Resources &amp;#124; Claverton Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferc.gov/news/videos/wellinghoff/2009/04-22-09-wellinghoff-transcript.pdf |title=FERC: Federal Regulation and Oversight of Energy |accessdate=2009-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506162616/https://www.ferc.gov/news/videos/wellinghoff/2009/04-22-09-wellinghoff-transcript.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some renewable electricity sources have identical variability to [[coal-fired power station]]s, so they are [[base-load]], and can be integrated into the electricity supply system without any additional back-up. Examples include:

* [[Bio-energy]], based on the combustion of crops and crop residues, or their gasification followed by combustion of the gas.
* [[Hot dry rock]] geothermal power, which is being developed in [[Geothermal energy exploration in Central Australia|Australia]] and the [[Geothermal energy in the United States|United States]].
* [[Solar thermal electricity]], with overnight heat storage in molten salt, water or rocks.

Grid operators in countries like Denmark and Spain now integrate large quantities of renewable energy into their electricity grids, with Denmark receiving 40% of its electricity from [[wind power]] during some months.&lt;ref name="Benjamin Sovacool 2009"/&gt;

Supporters say that the total electricity generated from a large-scale array of dispersed [[wind farm]]s, located in different wind regimes, cannot be accurately described as intermittent, because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously at irregular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 119; See also, {{cite journal | last1 = Sinden | first1 = G | year = 2007 | title = Characteristics of the UK wind resource: long term patterns and relationship to electricity  demand"' | url = | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 112–27 | doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2005.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a small amount of supplementary peak-load plant, which operates infrequently, large-scale distributed wind power can substitute for some base-load power and be equally reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/DissentMD2006.pdf In defence of renewable energy and its variability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829114854/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/DissentMD2006.pdf |date=2007-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydropower]] can be intermittent and/or dispatchable, depending on the configuration of the plant. Typical [[hydroelectric]] plants in the dam configuration may have substantial storage capacity, and be considered dispatchable. [[Run of the river]] hydroelectric generation will typically have limited or no storage capacity, and will be variable on a seasonal or annual basis (dependent on rainfall and snow melt).&lt;ref name="IEA2005WindVar"/&gt;

[[Amory Lovins]] suggests a few basic strategies to deal with these issues:

{{cquote|"The variability of sun, wind and so on, turns out to be a non-problem if you do several sensible things. One is to diversify your renewables by technology, so that weather conditions bad for one kind are good for another. Second, you diversify by site so they're not all subject to the same weather pattern at the same time because they're in the same place. Third, you use standard weather forecasting techniques to forecast wind, sun and rain, and of course hydro operators do this right now.

International groups are studying much higher penetrations (30-[[100% renewable energy]]), and conclusions are that these levels are also technically feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieawind.org/AnnexXXV/Meetings/Oklahoma/IEA%20SysOp%20GWPC2006%20paper_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DCFd3dj?url=http://www.ieawind.org/AnnexXXV/Meetings/Oklahoma/IEA%20SysOp%20GWPC2006%20paper_final.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-25 |df= }} IEA Wind Summary Paper, ''Design and Operation of Power Systems with Large Amounts of Wind Power'', September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, one summary of other studies indicated that if assuming that wind power contributed less than 20% of UK power consumption, then the intermittency would cause only moderate cost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,550/   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706221755/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/component/option%2Ccom_docman/task%2Cdoc_download/gid%2C550/ |date=July 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to manage wind power integration range from those that are commonly used at present (e.g. [[demand management]]) to potential new technologies for [[grid energy storage]]. Improved [[Wind Power Forecasting|forecasting]] can also contribute as the daily and seasonal variations in wind and solar sources are to some extent predictable. The [[Pembina Institute]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] state in the [[Renewable is Doable]] plan that resilience is a feature of renewable energy:

{{cquote|Diversity and dispersal also add system security. If one wind turbine fails, the lights won't flicker. If an entire windfarm gets knocked out by a storm, only 40,000 people will lose power. If a single Darlington reactor goes down, 400,000 homes, or key industries, could face instant blackouts. To hedge this extra risk, high premiums have to be paid for decades to ensure large blocks of standby generation.&lt;ref name="PEMBINAbrochure"/&gt;}}

'''Jan DeBlieu''' is an American writer whose work often focuses on how people are shaped by the landscapes in which they live. Her own writing has been influenced by her adopted home on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readthehook.com/83231/facetime-coastal-crusader-deblieus-change-begins-home|title=Coastal crusader: DeBlieu's change begins at home|last=Humphrey|first=Justin|date=19 March 2009|work=[[The Hook (newspaper)|The Hook]]|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the author of four books including ''Hatteras Journal'', ''Meant to Be Wild'', ''Wind'' (which won the [[John Burroughs Medal]] for Distinguished Natural History Writing, the highest national honor for that genre) and ''Year of the Comets.'' Her fifth book, which examines living in service to others, is forthcoming. She also has published dozens of essays and magazine articles, both in literary journals and mainstream publications like ''The New York Times Magazine,'' ''Smithsonian'', ''Audubon'', and ''Orion.'' Her work has been widely anthologized.

In 2003, she was named the Cape Hatteras Coastkeeper for the North Carolina Coastal Federation, a post she held until 2012. She has since returned to full-time writing.

While DeBlieu's work has mostly focused on naturally history, landscape, and place, this shifted after the death of her son in a car accident in 2009. Since then she has concentrated on exploring how ordinary people can help change the lives of people in need. This is the subject of her forthcoming book, ''Searching for Seva''.

In 2006, she was featured in the book ''Bedrock: Writers on the Wonders of Geology'' edited by Lauret E. Savoy, [[Eldridge M. Moores]], and Judith E. Moores ([[Trinity University (Texas)#Trinity_University Press|Trinity University Press]]) which looks at how writing pays a tribute to the Earth's geological features.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8077">'''Leatheroid''' is cellulose material very similar to [[vulcanized fibre]] in physical properties and uses. It is prepared using [[sizing|unsized]] cotton rag paper (as is vulcanized fibre) and mineral acid.

==Manufacturer==
Leatheroid was made Leatheroid Manufacturing Company and its successors the Mousam Manufacturing Company, the National Fibreboard Company and the Rogers Fibre Company. For nearly 50 years from 1881 to 1930 Leatheroid was made in [[Kennebunk, Maine]].

==History==
The Leatheroid Manufacturing Company's first existence can be traced to Wheeling, West 
Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Pan-handle: being historical collections of the counties of Ohio, Brooke, Marshall and  Hancock, West Virginia; J. H. Newton, G. G. Nichols, and A. G. Sprankle;. Published by J. A. Caldwell, Wheeling, W. VA.; 1879; pp 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1879 Session Laws of [[West Virginia]] showed the following individuals to hold shares:&lt;ref&gt;Acts of the Legislature of West Virginia at its Fourteenth Session Commencing January 8th 1879;  Published by W.J. Johnston Public Printer; Wheeling, West Virginia; 1879; p 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

The West Virginia law incorporated the company with $20,200 in initial capitalization, each share having a $100 value. The company was authorized to increase its capitalization to $100,000 through the sale of additional shares with the value of $100 each. Leatheroid operated in Wheeling for a year and then moved on to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for a year and next to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Finally Leatheroid was purchased by the Mousam Manufacturing Company and its equipment and manufacturing operations removed to Kennebunk, Maine.&lt;ref&gt;''American Mail and Export Journal''; July 1886; p17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The contributor: Representing the Young Men’s and Young Ladies Mutual Improvement Associations of  the Later-day Saints; Vol. VII: No. 8; May 1886; pp 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mousam Manufacturing Company was organized in 1875 to manufacture leatherboard at Kennebunk, Maine. Among those organizing Mousam Manufacturing Company were Emery Andrews, S. B. Rogers, Stephen Moore, and Homer Rogers. The company's name was the same as a cotton mill that had operated in Kennebunk from 1838 to 1850 and ceased operations after being destroyed in a fire.&lt;ref&gt;The Village of Kennebunk, Maine; George A. Gilpatric; The Star Print Inc, Kennebunk Maine; 1935; p 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trunks, textiles &amp; Transits Manufacturing on the Mousam River; Rosalind Magnuson; The Brick Store  Museum, 117 Main Street, Kennebunk, Maine 04043; September 2005; p22.&lt;/ref&gt; Mousam Manufacturing Company used most of its leatherboard in the production of shoe counters, which are used to stiffen the heel area of boots and shoes.

In 1881 when Mousam Manufacturing Company purchased Leatheroid and moved its manufacturing equipment into nearby mill buildings adjacent to its own leatherboard mill in Kennebunk, Maine, it organized it as a separate company, the Leatheroid Manufacturing Company. Emery Andrews, S.B. Rogers, Stephen Moore, and Homer Rogers were board members and controlling stock holders in the Leatheroid Manufacturing Company as they were in Mousam Manufacturing Company. In 1891 the Mousam Manufacturing Company and the Leatheroid Manufacturing Company along with Harwood Manufacturing Company of Leominster, Massachusetts, the Towne Manufacturing Company of Boston, Massachusetts, and the Clegg and Fisher Mill at Lawrence, Massachusetts, were merged into a new company known as the Consolidated Fibre Board and Leatheroid Company.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christian Union''; Vol.44:no15 October 10, 1891; p 703.&lt;/ref&gt; This consolidation was known as the National Fibre Board Company with Emery Andrews as president and the board of directors consisting of Charles H. Allen, Homer Rogers, J. A. Harwood, Stephen Moore, and W.C. Gogswell. In 1918 the National Fibre Board Company changed its name to Rogers Fibre Company. The officers of Rogers Fibre Company in 1920 were Elliott Rogers, Pres., Kennebunk, Me.; Louis Rogers, V-P; E. W. Freeman, Clerk, Portland, Me.; L. B.Rogers, Treas. &amp; Gen. Mgr.; E. O. Hallberg, Asst. Treas. Boston, Mass.&lt;ref&gt;''Moody's Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities''; 22nd Annual No.:Vol. 2 (K to Z); Poor’s  Publishing Company; 33 Broadway, NY, NY; 1921; pp 1315–1316.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 the Leatheroid business of Rogers Fibre Company and its equipment were sold to the Delaware Hard Fibre Company. All usable equipment was removed from the Leatheroid operations in the Island and Dirigo buildings at Kennebunk, thus bringing an end to Leatheroid production in Kennebunk, Maine.&lt;ref&gt;The Village of Kennebunk, Maine; George A. Gilpatric; The Star Print Inc, Kennebunk Maine; 1935; p 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current production==
The name Leatheroid is still used for seal and gasket material on the market today. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.advancedseals.com/materials/fibres-jointing-material/leatheroid/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The key patents for the development of leatheroid were:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Date !! Patent number !! Title !! Inventor(s) !! Assignor(s)
|-
| January 15, 1867 || 61,267 || Improvement in the Treatment of Paper and Paper Pulp || Augustus Theodore Schmidt of Pittsburgh PA ||
|-
| October 20. 1877 || 198,382 || Improvement in Manufacture of Parchment-Paper  || Thompson Hanna and Thompson S. Hanna of Pittsburgh PA || 
|-
| February 24, 1885 || 312,945 || Manufacture of Parchment-Paper or Leatheroid || Emery Andrews of Kennebunk, Maine  || Leatheroid Manufacturing Company of Kennebunk, Maine 
|}
 
These patents centered on using mineral acids (sulfuric and hydrochloric) to produce the high level of bonding for parchmentized paper and leatheroid as compared to using zinc chloride to produce vulcanized fibre. The basic process for producing parchmentized paper is to pass the paper through an acid bath, press it, wash the paper, neutralize the remaining acids in the paper with a caustic bath of ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, or other suitable caustic solution, wash the paper again, and then dry the paper in the normal way. This process is used to this day to produce parchmentized paper. However the use of this process to produce the highly bonded fibre board known as leatheroid had problems to be surmounted. Using the cutdown machine to build up multiple layers of paper to various board weights entailed the problem of how to keep the acid from destroying the cellulose chains. The key to the using the parchmentizing process for paper in the production of paperboard seems to center around using other chemical agents in the parchmentizing acid solution to retard or delay the destruction of the cellulose chains until such time as the acid is washed out or neutralized. Examples of such agents are given patent number 198,382 as zinc and dextrin (dextrine). Other organic matters that may substitute for dextrin mentioned in 198382 were crude petroleum, blood, albumen, and paper and pulp. Another technique used to retard or delay the action of the parchmentizing acid solution was to keep the reaction cold. The technique and equipment designed to accomplish it are described patent number 312,945. The importance of keeping the reaction cold was so important that leatheroid manufacturing in Kennebunk was suspended every summer until 1889 when the Leatheroid Manufacturing Company dug a well that provided a source of cold water year round as an alternative to using [[Mousam River]] water.&lt;ref&gt;Trunks, textiles &amp; Transits Manufacturing on the Mousam River; Rosalind Magnuson; The Brick Store  Museum, 117 Main Street, Kennebunk, Maine 04043; September 2005; p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5357">The '''rivers of [[Catalonia]]''' can be classified into four groups according to their source.
*'''Rivers of the Ebre basin''', which can be further divided into:
**the lower basin of the [[Ebre]] itself, which  corresponds with the [[Comarques of Catalonia|''comarques'']] of [[Ribera d'Ebre]], [[Terra Alta (comarca)|Terra Alta]], [[Baix Ebre]] and [[Montsià]].
**the basin of the [[Segre River|Segre]] and its affluents, which roughly corresponds, in [[Catalonia]], with the [[Lleida (province)|province of Lleida]]: the basin of the Segre also covers much of [[Aragon]].
*'''Rivers of the western Pyrenees''': [[Muga (river)|Muga]], [[Fluvià]], [[Ter (river)|Ter]], roughly corresponding with the [[Girona (province)|province of Girona]]
*'''Rivers of the Pre-Coastal Range''': [[Tordera]], [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]], [[Foix]], [[Gaià]], [[Francolí]]
*'''Rivers of the Coastal Range''': these are very short and of only local importance

The [[Llobregat]] deserves a special mention because of its importance: its basin covers most of the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]]. It source is in the pyreneean [[Serra del Cadí]] in the municipality of [[Castellar de n'Hug]] ([[Berguedà]]) and its valley is one of the main north-south communication routes in Catalonia.

The [[Aran Valley]] is the upper valley of the [[Garonne]] (''la Garona'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], ''era Garona'' in [[Aranese language|Aranese]]), an Atlantic river which meets the sea near [[Bordeaux]], [[France]]. The boundaries of the ''comarca'' do not correspond exactly with the [[Drainage basin|watershed]], and both the [[Noguera Ribagorçana]] and the [[Noguera Pallaresa]] have their sources on its territory.

The frontier between Catalonia and the [[Valencian Community]] is formed for much of its length by the [[Sénia River|Sénia]], while the [[Noguera Ribagorçana]] forms the frontier with Aragon for much of its length.

== List ==
Rivers are listed according to their estuaries, from north to south along the Catalan coastline, or according to the point of confluence, from the sea to the source, for rivers which do not flow directly into the sea. Names are given in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] with the appropriate [[definite article]]: [[Spanish language|Spanish]] names are given in parentheses. Catalan names are usually preferred in [[English language]] works, except for the Ebre which is usually referred to by its Spanish name ''Ebro''.

*la [[Muga (river)|Muga]]
*el [[Fluvià]]
*el [[Ter (river)|Ter]]
*la [[Tordera River|Tordera]]
*el [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]]
**el [[Congost (river)|Congost]]
**el [[Riu Ripoll|Ripoll]]
*el [[Llobregat]]
**l'[[Anoia (river)|Anoia]]
**el [[Cardener]]
**la [[Gavarresa]]
*el [[Foix River|Foix]]
*el [[Gaià River|Gaià]]
*el [[Francolí]]
*l' [[Ebre]]
**el [[Segre (river)|Segre]] 
***la [[Noguera Ribagorçana]]
***el [[Set (river)|Set]]
***el [[Corb (river)|Corb]]
***el [[Sió(river)|Sió]]
***la [[Noguera Pallaresa]]
***el [[Cinca (Spain)|Cinca]]
***el [[Rialb]]
***el [[Llobregós]]
***la [[Gran Valira|Valira]]
*la [[Sénia(river)|Sénia]]

== Linguistic note ==
The [[Catalan language]] has two words for "river", ''riu'' and ''riera''. The word ''riera'' is used for smaller rivers and for streams, and often indicates a seasonal river. Of the above list, only the Gavarresa is commonly classified as a ''riera'', all the others being qualified as ''rius''. The [[grammatical gender]] of Anoia is feminine, while that of Ebre is masculine.

== Economic importance ==
The main economic importance of the Catalan rivers is probably the role of their valleys as communication routes, particularly through the Coastal and Prelitteral Ranges. Hence routes inland from [[Barcelona]] pass either through the valley of the [[Llobregat]] or that of the [[Besòs (river)|Besòs]], and the [[Francolí]] valley is an important route inland from [[Tarragona]].

=== Irrigation ===
[[Irrigation]] is important in the drier areas of Catalonia, notably in the [[Central Depression]] and in the south. The [[Canal de Aragon y Cataluña|Canal de Aragó i Catalunya]] and the [[Canal d'Urgell]] distribute the waters of the [[Segre River|Segre]] across the [[Comarques of Catalonia|''comarques'']] of [[Noguera (comarca)|Noguera]] and [[Segrià]] where it is used for 
growing cereals, almonds and olives. Irrigation is also important in the ''comarques'' of [[Baix Ebre]] and [[Montsià]], where the cultivation of rice is widespread.

=== Hydroelectric generation ===
All of the larger Catalan rivers, with the exception of the Llobregat, have been dammed for [[hydroelectric power]]. By far the largest dams are those on the [[Ebre]] at [[Riba-roja]] and at [[Flix]] ([[Ribera d'Ebre]]). Other dams include
*on the [[Noguera Pallaresa]]: Sallente, Cabdella, Molinos, Tavascan, [[La Pobla de Segur]], [[Talarn]] ([[Pallars Jussà]]), Terradets ([[Àger]], Noguera)
*on the [[Noguera Ribagorçana]]: Escales (below [[Pont de Suert]], [[Alta Ribagorça]]), Santa Anna, Moralets, Baserca ([[Ivars de Noguera]])
*on the Segre: [[Oliana]] ([[Alt Urgell]]), [[Seròs]] (Segrià)
*on the [[Ter (river)|Ter]]: Sau ([[Vilanova de Sau]], [[Osona]]), [[Susqueda]] ([[Selva]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5073">In [[physics]], a '''mesophase''' is a [[state of matter]] intermediate between [[liquid]] and [[solid]]. [[Gelatin]] is a common example of a partially ordered structure in a mesophase. Further, biological structures such as the [[lipid bilayer]]s of [[cell membrane]]s are examples of mesophases.

[[Georges Friedel]] (1922) called attention to the "mesomorphic states of matter"&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Friedel]] (1922) "Les Étates Mésomorphes de la Matière", ''Annales de Physique (Paris)'' 18: 273&amp;ndash;474&lt;/ref&gt; in his scientific assessment of observations of the so-called [[liquid crystal]]s. Conventionally a [[crystal]] is solid, and [[crystallization]] converts liquid to solid. The [[oxymoron]] of the liquid crystal is resolved through the notion of mesophases. The observations noted an [[optic axis of a crystal|optic axis]] persisting in materials that had been [[melting|melted]] and had begun to [[Fluid dynamics|flow]]. The term ''liquid crystal'' persists as a [[colloquialism]], but use of the term was criticized in 1993: In ''The Physics of Liquid Crystals''&lt;ref name=G&amp;P&gt;P.G. de Gennes &amp; J. Prost (1993) ''The Physics of Liquid Crystals'', 2nd edition, [[Oxford University Press]] {{ISBN|0-19-852024-7}} &lt;/ref&gt; the mesophases are introduced from the beginning:
:...certain [[Organic matter|organic materials]] do not show a single transition from solid to liquid, but rather a cascade of transitions involving new phases. The [[List of materials properties|mechanical properties]] and the [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] properties of these phases are intermediate between those of a liquid and those of a crystal. For this reason they have often been called ''liquid crystals''. A more proper name is ‘mesomorphic phases’ (''mesomorphic'': intermediate form)&lt;ref name=G&amp;P/&gt;{{rp|page one}}

Further, "The classification of mesophases (first clearly set out by G. Friedel in 1922) is essentially based on symmetry."&lt;ref name=G&amp;P/&gt;{{rp|10}}

Molecules that demonstrate mesophases are called [[mesogen]]s.

In technology, molecules in which the optic axis is subject to manipulation during a mesophase have become commercial products as they can be used to manufacture [[display device]]s, known as [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs). The susceptibility of the optical axis, called a ''director'', to an electric or magnetic field produces the potential for an optical switch that obscures light or lets it pass.  Methods used include the [[Freedericksz transition]] and the [[twisted nematic field effect]]. From early [[liquid crystal display]]s the buying public has embraced the low-power optical switch facility of mesophases with director.

Consider a solid consisting of a single molecular species and subjected to [[melting]]. Ultimately it is rendered to an [[Isotropy|isotropic]] state classically referred to as liquid. Mesophases occur before then when an intermediate state of [[order and disorder (physics)|order]] is still maintained as in the [[Liquid_crystal#Nematic_phase|nematic]], [[Liquid_crystal#Smectic_phases|smectic]], and [[columnar phase|columnar]] phases of liquid crystals. Mesophases thus exhibit [[anisotropy]]. LCD devices work as an optical switch which is turned off and on by an [[electric field]] applied to the mesogen with director. The response of the director to the field is expressed with [[viscosity]] parameters, as in the Ericksen-Leslie theory in [[continuum mechanics]] developed by [[Jerald Ericksen]] and [[Frank Matthews Leslie]].

Mesophase phenomena are important in many scientific fields. The publishing arms of professional societies have academic journals as needed. For instance, the [[American Chemical Society]] has both ''[[Macromolecules (journal)|Macromolecules]]'' and ''[[Langmuir (journal)|Langmuir]]'', while [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] has ''[[Soft Matter (journal)|Soft Matter]]'', and [[American Physical Society]] has ''[[Physical Review E]]'', and [[Elsevier]] has ''[[Advances in Colloid and Interface Science]]''.

'''Moleanos''' is a Portuguese limestone with light beige colored background and a slight grayish tonality, with thin to medium grain and disperse brownish fine spots. With a medium hardness, it’s frequently used for cladding, pavements, interior decor, street furniture and other stoneworks. The main and most popular type is Moleanos Classic, however there several types of this limestone such as Moleanos Blue Light Water, Moleanos Shelly, Moleanos Moon and Moleanos White.

[[File:Polje_inundado_02.jpg|thumb|Serra de Aire e Candeeiros]] 
Moleanos is currently one of the most popular limestones in the world, being used on a large scale a little throughout the world due to its lower price and uniform color. There are several types of Moleanos, which vary depending on where they are extracted. The most popular are, Moleanos White, Moleanos Moon, Moleanos Blue Light Water, and Moleanos Shelly.

This stone can be used in projects that require large quantities because it is a stone that exists in abundance and it is explored by numerous quarries. On the other hand, it is an extremely versatile stone, can be used in flooring and facing slabs, for interior and exterior pavings, cladding, masonry, stonework, and many others.

== Extraction Area ==
[[File:Moleanos_Quarry.jpg|thumb|Moleanos Portuguese Quarry]] 
The Moleanos limestone is extracted in Portugal, next to a small town called Moleanos. The city is located in the center of the country and is next to “Serra de Aire e Candeiros”, which is the most important limestone extraction area in Portugal. The quarries of this stone are approximately 1 hour away from the capital of the country, Lisbon.

== Recommended Use ==
[[File:Horseferry Road with Moleanos Cladding.jpg|thumb|Moleanos Cladding by LSI Stone]]
Moleanos is a very versatile stone, it has many uses. Due to the properties of this stone, with enormous hardness for a limestone and with a uniform beige color, it allows a beautiful look wherever applied. This stone is very used in exterior and interior floors with moderate or intense use. It is also very popular in external and internal claddings, mainly due to its resistance. Other uses like fireplaces, street chairs, bathtubs, balusters and columns, window and door frames, garden decoration and fountains are very popular too, but there are many others.

The [http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/research/ruralelectrification/casestudies/mali/index.shtml Multifunction Platform (MFP)] is a concept and a structure developed by [[UNDP]] and deployed in a number of West African countries, and [[Tanzania]] and [[Zambia]]. The idea has been to place an MFP in a village which, driven by a [[diesel engine]], powers devices such as [[pumps]] and [[grain mill]]s and [[Electric generator|generators]]. The UNDP has produced a number of reports on this project in [[Mali]] which [http://www.energyandenvironment.undp.org/undp/index.cfm?module=Library&amp;page=DocumentList&amp;LibraryID=8&amp;RegionID=4&amp;CountryID=MLI can be accessed here.]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  There are few independent analyses of the development impact of the concept of the multifunctional platform, but recently an article in the journal Energy Policy,which [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V2W-4XSSV3C-4/2/168d4100da1f1b87a2584912bde29b09 can be accessed here], provide a more nuanced view of programme achievements than impact assessments made public at earlier stages of the project.

The primary impact of the MFP has been on women's work (on reducing daily drudgery and opening up new opportunities in life) and the UNDP's deployment has been to women's organisations, with part local funding and part local grant.

In places where [[Jatropha]] is grown, a device, powered by the MFP, can crush the Jatropha seed. The oil produced is suitable for running the diesel engine, allowing the MFP to produce fuel for its own operation. The company Mali Biocarburant has carried out a pilot with in a number of villages in Mali, as [https://web.archive.org/web/20140812211338/http://www.ease-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Final-report-MBSA.pdf reported here]. Also, [http://www.malifolkecenter.org/ The Mali Folke Centre] has reported on its success in this field.

More recently, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140809164402/http://fact-foundation.com/ FACT Foundation] has implemented a pilot programme in which biogas is used for co-fuelling MFP diesel engines. In five villages in Mali, biogas systems were installed and connected to the MFP diesel engines. As [http://www.snvworld.org/download/publications/snv_fact_productive_biogas_2014_final.pdf reported here], first results look promising, although further work is required to improve the management of the biogas systems.

Volunteers from [[Engineers Without Borders (Canada)|Engineers Without Borders]] have been involved with assessment of some MFP projects, as [https://web.archive.org/web/20070216195956/http://www.nigercurrents.ca/index.php/2006/08/09/p53 reported here].

Whereas the [[UNDP]]'s projects have involved substantial injection of foreign expert advice, a low budget self-initiated approach was in recent times taken  in [[Kiliba]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034940/http://aplaceof.info/kiliba/program1.htm Farm of Hope], a project of [[Fondation chirezi]]. However, that project failed to materialise.

The '''Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel''' (NAMOC) is the main body of a [[turbidity current]] system of channels and canyons running on the sea bottom from the [[Hudson Strait]], through the [[Labrador Sea]] and ending at the [[Sohm Abyssal Plain]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Contrary to most other such systems which fan away from the main channel, numerous [[tributary|tributaries]] run into the NAMOC and end there. The density of those tributaries is the highest near the [[Labrador Peninsula]], but the longest tributary, called Imarssuak Mid-Ocean Channel (IMOC), originates in the Atlantic Ocean. 

Most topography data on the NAMOC originate from wide-range [[Side-scan sonar|sonar]] scans. With a total length of about {{convert|3800|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, NAMOC is one of the longest underwater channels in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hesse|first1=Reinhard|title="Drainage systems" associated with mid-ocean channels and submarine yazoos: Alternative to submarine fan depositional systems|journal=Geology|volume=17|pages=1148|year=1989|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1989)017&lt;1148:DSAWMO&gt;2.3.CO;2|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LuMgcgupaJcC&amp;pg=PA286|page=286|title=Glaciated continental margins: an atlas of acoustic images|editor= Thomas A.

'''Ocean Networks Canada''' is a [[University of Victoria]] initiative that operates the [[NEPTUNE]] and [[VENUS]] cabled ocean observatories in the northeast [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Salish Sea]]. Additionally, Ocean Networks Canada operates smaller community-based observatories offshore from [[Cambridge Bay, Nunavut]].,&lt;ref&gt;Juniper and McLean, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell River, Kitamaat Village and Digby Island. These observatories collect data on physical, chemical, biological, and geological aspects of the ocean over long time periods. As with other ocean observatories such as ESONET, [[Ocean Observatories Initiative]], MACHO and DONET, scientific instruments connected to Ocean Networks Canada are operated remotely and provide continuous streams of freely available data to researchers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Puilliat et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 gigabytes of data are collected every day.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey et al, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[VENUS]] Observatory is situated at three main sites in the [[Salish Sea]], including [[Saanich Inlet]] (depth 100 m), the eastern and central [[Strait of Georgia]] (depths 170–300 m), and the [[Fraser River]] delta.

The [[NEPTUNE]] observatory is situated off the west coast of [[Vancouver Island]] in [[Barkley Sound]], along the [[Cascadia subduction zone]], on the Cascadia Basin abyssal plain, and on the Endeavour segment of the  [[Juan de Fuca Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, the system includes 3 observatories, 5 shore stations, 850+ km of seafloor backbone cables, 11 instrumented sites, 32 instrument platforms, 6 mobile instrument platforms, 400+ instruments and over 2000 scientific sensors deployed.&lt;ref&gt;Heesemann et al, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific topics of study that are enabled by data from these observatories include Arctic oceanography,&lt;ref&gt;Juniper and McLean, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; deep-sea biodiversity,&lt;ref&gt;Matabos et al, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; marine ecosystem function,&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Pawlowicz, 22014&lt;/ref&gt; [[marine forensics]],&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2010&lt;/ref&gt; gas hydrates,&lt;ref&gt;Riedel and Willoughby, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; hydrothermal vents,&lt;ref&gt;Bemis et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; marine mammals,&lt;ref&gt;André et al, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; sediment&lt;ref&gt;Katz et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and benthic&lt;ref&gt;Robert et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; dynamics and tsunami&lt;ref&gt;Fine et al, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; studies.

== Study sites ==
Ocean Networks Canada instrumentations are installed in the following seafloor locations:

=== Salish Sea ===
[[File:Ocean Networks Canada Installations in the Salish Sea.jpg|thumb|Ocean Networks Canada installations and data sources in the Salish Sea.]]

==== Saanich Inlet ====
[[File:Ocean Networks Canada Installations in Saanich Inlet.jpg|thumb|2013 map of Ocean Networks Canada installations in Saanich Inlet between Sidney and Mill Bay, BC, on the east coast of Vancouver Island. This is one of the sites on the VENUS observatory. The University of Victoria's Ocean Technology Test Bed is located here as well.]]
Saanich Inlet, at the southern end of Vancouver Island, Canada, is a naturally hypoxic basin. A shallow sill (70 m) at the mouth isolates the deep basin (215 m) that experiences seasonal deep-water anoxia as a result of high primary productivity and subsequent degradation of sedimented organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;Matabos, Tunnicliffe et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Saanich Inlet network consists of cabled arrays of instruments in [[Mill Bay, British Columbia|Mill Bay]], [[Patricia Bay]] and an autonomous mooring at the entrance (sill) to the inlet. Two cabled surface buoys are connected to the Patricia Bay installation, supporting a technology testbed facility (Patricia Bay) and a full water column observation station (Coles Bay). Patricia Bay installations include:
* Seafloor network at 100 m depth connected to a shore station at the [[Institute of Ocean Sciences]]
* Surface buoy based Ocean Technology Testbed designed and built to support engineering and technology development.
* Surface based Buoy Profiling System (BPS) designed and built for water column measurements off Coles Bay in central Saanich Inlet.
* Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ("Bluefin")

In Mill Bay, a mini-observatory is installed at Brentwood College with basic sensors that measure water properties at 8 m depth.

==== Strait of Georgia ====
[[File:Ocean Networks Canada Installations in the Strait of Georgia.jpg|thumb|2013 map of Ocean Networks Canada's installations in the Salish Sea, which comprise the Strait of Georgia portion of the VENUS observatory.]]
A network with three sites on seafloor at Central, East and Fraser Delta&lt;ref&gt;Lintern and Hill, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; locations of the southern [[Strait of Georgia]], and surface-based systems on BC Ferries, Iona Causeway, and Coal Port terminal. Installations in the Strait of Georgia include:
* Seafloor networks linking 3 nodes at 300 m (Central), 175 m (East), and 170 m (Fraser Delta)
* Shore-based High Frequency radar (CODAR with 2 antennas)
* Instrumentation on BC Ferries vessels ("Seekeeper")
* Ocean glider (Webb "Slocum")

=== Northeast Pacific ===

==== Barkley Canyon ====
Barkley Canyon extends from the continental shelf edge at 400 m down the continental slope to the canyon axis at 985 m water depth. Located at the leading edge of the [[Cascadia subduction zone]], this site supports the study of the accretionary prism, where the sediments pile along the continental slope as they are scraped off the subducting or descending tectonic plate. This is also a location where pressure, temperature, gas saturation, and local biological and chemical conditions are just right for exposed gas hydrates to be stable on the seafloor. [[Gas hydrates]] have gas molecules, typically methane in marine environments, trapped within “cages” of water molecules. This gives them a crystalline structure that resembles ice and can appear as white to yellow mounds covered by sediment on the seafloor.

The region is influenced by a major ocean current system. Off the coast, the west wind drift current splits to create the Alaska and the California currents (the [[California current]] system). The direction and strength of the currents regulate the upwelling/downwelling regime along the coast, with a flow towards the equator in summer (California current) and reversal in winter (Alaska current). In addition to these two currents, a large submarine canyon acts as a primary conduit for the transfer of sediment from the continental slope to the deep-sea.

Organisms living in the depths of Barkley Canyon have evolved to be able to persist in areas with high pressure, no light, and low nutrients/food availability. The Barkley Canyon instruments span a diversity of habitats, each of which is associated with its own specialized biological community. Most of the areas within Barkley Canon are characterised by a soft, finely sedimented seafloor. Video observations suggest that animal densities are higher at the shallower sites compared with the deeper sites, although most species are present at all sites. A number of fish including sablefish, thornyheads, rockfish, flatfish, sharks, skates, hagfish and eelpouts have been observed throughout Barkley Canyon. The area is rich with invertebrates as well including molluscs (bivalves, octopus, snails), echinoderms (sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and urchins) as well as arthropods (crabs and shrimp). Cnidarians are seen both on the seafloor (anemones, sea pens, and corals) as well as floating in the water column (jellyfish) along with other organisms such as salps, ctenophores, and tunicates.&lt;ref&gt;Juniper et al, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Where gas hydrates are observed on the seafloor, there are mats of chemosynthetic bacteria which derive their energy from hydrogen sulphide produced by the oxidate of methane by a second group of microbes living deep within the sediments. Other chemosynthetic sulphide-oxidizing bacteria live in symbiosis with clams who live at these hydrate mounts. Many of the species observed elsewhere in Barkley Canyon are not dependent on this system but are frequently observed in the area.

==== Cascadia Basin ====
[[File:Ocean Networks Canada Installations at Cascadia Basin.jpg|thumb|2013 layout of installations at Ocean Networks Canada's Cascadia Basin site on the NEPTUNE observatory.]]
The Cascadia Basin is the heavily sediment part of the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] that extends from the base the continental margin to the west where the sediments lap on to the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank. The Juan de Fuca Plate is one of the last remnants of the [[Farallon Plate]], the original eastern Pacific oceanic plate, which has been almost entirely subducted beneath North America. The flat sediment surface constitutes an abyssal plain, an exceedingly vast environment that covers over 50% of the planet’s surface. Seemingly inhospitable, with temperatures below 2&amp;nbsp;°C, high-pressures, and a total absence of light, the Cascadia Basin is nevertheless home to an assortment of well-adapted organisms.

Depending mostly on marine snow—the continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from surface waters—little is known about the complicated food web connecting the organisms of the deep. Because of the harsh environment, there is a low density of organisms observed. Despite the low density, there is a fairly diverse community living on the abyssal plain. Installation and maintenance work has enabled a number of these organisms to be observed. The main groups of organisms observed include fish (skates and rattails), echinoderms (sea cucumbers, sea stars, brittle stars, and crinoids), molluscs (octopus and squid), sea pens, crabs, and squat lobsters. A number of pelagic (living in the water column) organisms were observed such as squid, jellyfish, ostracods, ctenophores, and salps.

A few isolated outcropping seamounts that pierce through more than 200 m of impermeable sediments, are conduits that allow hydrologic exchange between the open ocean and the upper oceanic crust—the largest aquifer of the planet. The Cascadia Basin site is placed in the vicinity of several circulation obviation retrofit kit (CORK) borehole observatories, which are designed to study the hydrology, geochemistry and microbiology of the upper oceanic crust. CORKs are also being used to investigate changes in regional plate strain that are caused by earthquakes on the plate boundaries. The seafloor pressure measurements of the CORK borehole observatories constitute the center of a “[[tsunami]]-meter”, a network of several high precision, rapid sampling bottom pressure recorders (BPRs), that allows precise determination of deep water tsunami amplitude, direction of propagation, and speed.

==== Clayoquot Slope ====
The name Clayoquot (pronounced “Clah-quot”) is an anglicized version of Tla-o-qui-aht, the largest nation in the [[Nuu-chah-nulth]] (Nootka) First Nations, whose people have resided in the [[Clayoquot Sound]] region near [[Tofino]] and [[Ucluelet, British Columbia|Ucluelet]] for at least the last 2000 years. The Clayoquot Slope site lies about 1250 m below sea level and approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km landward of the toe of the [[Cascadia subduction zone]]. The Cascadia subduction zone is the area at which the [[Juan de Fuca plate]] is subducting (descending) beneath the North American plate. This is a zone where much of the thick layer of sediments deposited on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge are scraped off and accreted as the tectonic plates converge (move together). As sediments thicken and compact from accretion, pore waters are expelled from the sediment, and gases — primarily biogenic methane — contribute to the formation of [[gas hydrates]] in the upper few hundred metres of the sediment. At this site, a cold vent, known as Bullseye Vent, has formed along with significant concentrations of gas hydrates.&lt;ref&gt;Scherwath et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayoquot Slope is home to a variety of deep-sea organisms. Many demersal fish (fish which live very near the bottom) were observed (rockfish, flatfish, throny heads, and rattails) along with echinoderms (sea cucumbers, brittle stars, sea stars), octopus, crabs, cnidarians (sea pens, corals, anemones), and bacterial mats. In the water column, organisms such as squid, krill, jellyfish, siphonophores, and larvaceans have been observed during installation and maintenance work.

==== Endeavour ====
[[File:Ocean Networks Canada Installations at Endeavour.jpg|thumb|2013 map of Ocean Networks Canada installations along the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca mid-ocean ridge in the northeast Pacific. This site is part of the NEPTUNE observatory.]]
Endeavour (depth 2200–2400 m) is a northern segment of the [[Juan de Fuca Ridge]] which, in turn, is part of the complex, 80,000&amp;nbsp;km long mid-ocean ridge system spanning the World Ocean. Juan de Fuca Ridge is a medium rate spreading centre (~6&amp;nbsp;cm/yr) forming the divergent boundary between the Pacific (to the west) and the Juan de Fuca (to the east) tectonic plates . At these divergent boundaries, convection currents in the mantle rise up as magma, emerge through the rifts as lava, and crystallise as new rock (basalts and gabbro). These processes continually create new ocean crust. Hydrothermal vents, which typically form along these mid-ocean ridges, are fissures from which geothermally heated water flows. The water flowing out of vents is dominantly seawater drawn into the system through the faults, porous sediments, and volcanic rocks. As the cool seawater moves through the sediment and rock towards the hot magma, the water becomes super heated (300-400&amp;nbsp;°C) and rich in dissolved mineral elements (such as sulphur, iron, zinc and copper) from the young ocean crust. When the hot effluent is expelled, it encounters the cold, ambient seawater (about 2&amp;nbsp;°C) minerals precipitate from the element-rich vent water. At the Endeavour segment, a notably vigorous venting area, black smokers form at the high temperature vents,where the effluent is precipitating iron sulphides.This gives the plumeits dark colour and deposits sulphide-minerals, creating chimneys up to 30 m in height. There are 6 known vent fields with distinct morphologies spaced about 2&amp;nbsp;km apart along the axial rift valley of the segment.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley et al, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

These tall sulphide chimneys (hydrothermal vents) host some unique ecological communities. While most of the deep sea depends on near-surface productivity with photosynthesis as its fundamental energy source, vent communities are completely independent from the surface and sunlight. Bacteria are able to use reduced compounds from the vent effluent as an energy source ([[chemosynthesis]]). These bacteria can be free-living or symbiotic and are the base of the food web of these communities where 90% of the species are endemic to this special environment. The tubeworm Ridgeia piscesae grows in large colonies in diffuse venting areas, supported by the symbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria developing in their cells. These worms have no mouth and rely on their internal symbiotic bacteria to survive. Other species living within hydrothermal communities include limpets, worms (scale worms and sulphide worms), fish, and sea spiders.

==== Folger Passage ====
[[File:Ocean Networks Canada Installations in Folger Passage.jpg|thumb|2013 map of Ocean Networks Canada installations at Folger Passage in Barkley Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. This site is part of the NEPTUNE observatory in the northeast Pacific.]]
Folger Passage is located at the mouth of [[Barkley Sound]], offshore [[Vancouver Island]] near [[Bamfield, BC|Bamfield]], British Columbia. The seafloor composition includes cobble, gravel, soft sandy sediment, and carbonate-rich detritus. Two instrument platforms, Folger Deep (100 m) and Folger Pinnacle (23 m), are installed at Folger Passage. Folger Deep is situated on soft sediment at the mouth of an inlet channel while the Folger Pinnacle platform is secured to the top of a rocky reef within a rockfish conservation area.

This coastal zone is ideal for studies of land-ocean interactions and coastal physical oceanography. Estuarine circulation from Barkley Sound is influenced by the shelf dynamics of an eastern boundary current, creating a complex physical environment. Surface outflow drives a deep water inflow which is strongly influenced by upwelling and downwelling conditions on the nearby continental shelf. The nutrient-rich, terrestrial freshwater discharge and the nutrient-rich, cool, salty upwelled water support a diverse and abundant ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;Pawlowicz and McClure, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Folger Pinnacle, located atop a shallow reef, has dense mats of sponges, ascidians and encrusting algae. There are numerous types of sessile (bottom attached) organisms including sponges, anemones, bryozoans, tunicates, and barnacles. Since this is a rockfish conservation area, there is a wide variety of rockfish (yellowtail, China, quillback, Puget Sound, black, and blue) in addition to many other fish (kelp greenling, lingcod, flatfish, wolfeels), molluscs (giant Pacific octopus, mussles, swimming scallops, and snails), and echinoderms (seastars, sea cucumbers, and urchins). An echosounder installed at Folger Deep shows evidence of a dense zooplankton community and schools of fish in the water column, while hydrophones regularly record the songs of whales and dolphins in the area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16461">'''Oil pollution toxicity to marine fish''' has been observed from [[oil spill]]s such as the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' disaster, and from nonpoint sources, such as [[surface runoff]], which is the largest source of oil pollution in marine waters.

[[Crude oil]] entering waterways from spills or runoff contain [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), the most toxic components of oil. The route of PAH uptake into fish depends on many environmental factors and the properties of the PAH. The common routes are [[ingestion]], ventilation of the gills, and dermal uptake. Fish exposed to these PAHs exhibit an array of toxic effects including [[genetic damage]], morphological deformities, altered growth and development, decreased body size, inhibited swimming abilities and [[mortality rate|mortality]].&lt;ref name="Carls et al. 1999"&gt;Carls, MG, Rice, SD, Hose, JE. 1999.

Environmental Health Perspectives, 113 (12): 1755-1762.&lt;/ref&gt; The morphological deformities of PAH exposure, such as fin and jaw malformations, result in significantly reduced survival in fish due to the reduction of swimming and feeding abilities.&lt;ref name="Carls et al. 1999" /&gt; While the exact mechanism of PAH toxicity is unknown, there are four proposed mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Barron et al. 2003" /&gt; The difficulty in finding a specific toxic mechanism is largely due to the wide variety of PAH compounds with differing properties.&lt;ref name="Barron et al. 2003" /&gt;

== History ==
Research on the [[environmental impact of the petroleum industry]] began in earnest, during the mid to late 20th century, as the oil industry developed and expanded.&lt;ref name ="25 years after Exxon Valdez"&gt;Shigenaka, G. 2014. Twenty-Five Years After the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill: NOAA’s Scientific Support, Monitoring and Research. Seattle: NOAA Office of Response and Restoration.&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale transport of crude oil increased as a result of the increasing worldwide demand for oil, subsequently increasing the number of oil spills.&lt;ref name="25 years after Exxon Valdez" /&gt; Oil spills provided perfect opportunities for scientists to examine the [[in situ]] effects of crude oil exposure to marine ecosystems, and collaborative efforts between the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and the [[United States Coast Guard]] resulted in improved response efforts and detailed research on oil pollution's effects.&lt;ref name="25 years after Exxon Valdez" /&gt; The [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] in 1989, and the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] in 2010, both resulted in increased scientific knowledge on the specific effects of oil pollution toxicity to marine fish.

=== ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill ===
Focused research on oil pollution toxicity to fish began in earnest in 1989, after the ''Exxon Valdez'' tanker struck a reef in [[Prince William Sound]], Alaska and spilled approximately 11 million gallons of crude oil into the surrounding water.&lt;ref name="Skinner, Reilly 1989"&gt;Skinner, SK, Reilly, WK. 1989. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill: A Report to the President. United States National Response Team.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] was the largest in the history of the United States.&lt;ref name="Skinner, Reilly 1989" /&gt; There were many adverse ecological impacts of the spill including the loss of the loss of billions of [[Pacific herring]] and [[pink salmon]] eggs.&lt;ref name="25 years after Exxon Valdez"/&gt; Pacific herring were just beginning to spawn in late March when the spill occurred, resulting in nearly half of the populations eggs being exposed to crude oil. Pacific herring spawn in the [[intertidal]] and [[subtidal]] zones, making the vulnerable eggs easily exposed to pollution.&lt;ref name="Carls et al. 1999"/&gt;

=== ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill ===
After April 20, 2010, when an explosion on the ''Deepwater Horizon'' Macondo oil drilling platform triggered the largest [[oil spill]] in US history, another opportunity for oil toxicity research was presented.&lt;ref name="adams 2015"&gt;Adams, A. 2015. Summary of Information concerning the Ecological and Economic Impacts of the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Disaster. National Resource Defense Council. IP:15-04-A&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 171 million gallons of crude oil flowed from the seafloor into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], exposing the majority of surrounding [[biota (ecology)|biota]].&lt;ref name="adams 2015" /&gt; The [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] also coincided directly with spawning window of various ecologically and commercially important fish species, including yellowfin and Atlantic bluefin tuna.&lt;ref name="Incardona 2014"&gt;Incardona JP, Gardner LD, Linbo TL, Brown TL, Esbaugh AJ, Mager E, Stieglitz JD, French BL, Labenia JS, Laetz CA, Tagal M, Sloan CA, Elizur A, Benetti DD, Grosell M, Block BA, Scholz NL. 2014. Deepwater Horizon crude oil impacts the developing hearts of large predatory pelagic fish. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111(15): 1510-1518.&lt;/ref&gt; The oil spill directly affected Atlantic bluefin tuna, as approximately 12% of larval tuna were located in oil contaminated waters,&lt;ref&gt;Muhling, BA, Roffer, MA, Lamkin, JT, Ingram Jr., GW, Upton, MA, Gawlikowski, G, Muller-Karger, F, Habtes, S, Richards, WJ. 2012. Overlap between Atlantic bluefin tuna spawning grounds and observed Deepwater Horizon surface oil in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Marine Pollution Bulletin. 64(4): 679-687.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gulf of Mexico is the only known spawning grounds for the western population of bluefin tuna.&lt;ref name="adams 2015" /&gt;

== Exposure to oil==
Oil spills, as well daily oil runoff from urbanized areas can lead to [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAHs) entering marine ecosystems. Once PAHs  enter the marine environment, fish can be exposed to them via ingestion, ventilation of the gills, and dermal uptake.&lt;ref name="synder 2015"&gt;Snyder, Susan, Erin Pulster, Dana Wetzel, Steven Murawski. 2015. PAH exposure in Gulf of Mexico demersal fishes, post- deepwater horizon. Environmental Science and Technology 49: 8786-8795.&lt;/ref&gt; The major route of uptake will depend on the behavior of the species of fish and the physicochemical properties of the PAH of concern. Habitat can be a major deciding factor for the route of exposure. For example, demersal fish or fish that consume demersal fish are highly likely to ingest PAHs that have sorbed to the sediment, whereas fish that swim at the surface are at a higher risk for dermal exposure. Upon coming in contact with a PAH, [[bioavailability]] will effect how readily the PAH is taken up. The EPA identifies 16 major PAHs of concern and each of these PAHs has a different degree of bioavailability. For instance, PAHs with lower molecular weight are more bioavailable because they dissolve more readily in water and are therefore more bioavailable for fish within the water column. Similarly, [[hydrophilic]] PAHs are more bioavailable for uptake by fish. For this reason, usage of [[oil dispersants]], like [[Corexit]], to treat oil spills can increase the uptake of PAHs by increasing their solubility in water and making them more available for uptake via the gills.&lt;ref name="synder 2015" /&gt; Once a PAH is taken up, the fish's metabolism can affect the duration and intensity of the exposure to target tissues. Fish are able to readily metabolize 99% of PAHs to a more hydrophilic [[metabolite]] through their hepato-bilary system.&lt;ref name="synder 2015" /&gt; This allows for the excretion of PAHs. The rate of metabolism of PAHs will depend on the sex and size of the species. The ability to metabolize PAHs into a more hydrophillic form can prevent [[bioaccumulation]] and halt PAHs from being passed on to organisms further up the food web. Because oil can persist in the environment long after oil spills via sedimentation, demersal fish are likely to be continually exposed to PAHs many years after oil spills. This has been proven by looking at the biliary PAH metabolites of bottom dwelling fish. For instance, bottom dwelling fish still showed elevated levels of low molecular weight PAH metabolites 10 years after ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill.&lt;ref name="synder 2015" /&gt;

=== Crude oil components ===
[[Crude oil]] is composed of more than 17,000 compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Pampanin, DM, Sydnes, MO. (2013). Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons a Constituent of Petroleum: Presence and Influence in the Aquatic Environment, Hydrocarbon, Dr. Vladimir Kutcherov (Ed.), InTech&lt;/ref&gt; Among these 17,000 compounds are PAHs, which are considered the most toxic components of oil.&lt;ref name="synder 2015"/&gt; PAHs are formed by [[pyrogenic]] and petrogenic processes. Petrogenic PAHs are formed by the elevated pressure of organic material. In contrast, pyrogenic PAHs are formed through the incomplete combustion of organic material. Crude oil naturally contains petrogenic PAHs and these PAH levels are increased significantly through the burning of oil which creates pyrogenic PAHs. The level of PAHs found in crude oil differs with the type of crude oil. For example, crude oil from the ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill had PAH concentrations of 1.47%, while PAH concentrations from the North Sea have much lower PAH concentrations of 0.83%.&lt;ref name="synder 2015" /&gt;

=== Sources of crude oil pollution ===
Crude oil contamination in marine ecosystems can lead to both pyrogenic and petrogenic PAHs entering these ecosystems. Petrogenic PAHs can enter waterways through oil seeps, major oil spills, creosote and fuel oil runoff from urban areas.&lt;ref name="Hussein"&gt;Hussein, Abdel, and Mona Mansour. 2015. A review on polcyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: Source, environmental impact, effect on human health and remedation. Egyptian Journal of Petroleum 25: 107-123&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrogenic PAH sources consist of diesel soot tire rubber and coal dust.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, RM, Ryba, S, Cantwell, M,  Perron, MM,  Tien, R, Thibideau, LM. 2001. Bioavalibility of PAHs from pyrogenic and petrogenic sources using glass fish. Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry Annual Meeting, Baltimore, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are natural sources of PAHs such as volcanic activity and seepage of coal deposits, anthropogenic sources pose the most significant input of PAHs into the environment.&lt;ref name="Hussein" /&gt; These anthroprogenic sources include residential heating, asphalt production, coal gasification, and petroleum usage.&lt;ref name="Hussein" /&gt; Petrogenic PAH contamination is more common from crude oil spills such as ''Exxon Valdez'', or oil seeps; however, with runoff pyrogenic PAHs can also be prevalent. Although major oil spills such as ''Exxon Valdez'' can introduce a large amount of crude oil to a localized  area in a short time span, daily runoff comprises most of the oil pollution to marine ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition can also be a source of PAHs into marine ecosystems. The deposition of PAHs from the atmosphere into a water body is largely influenced by the  gas-particle partitioning of the PAH.&lt;ref name="Hussein" /&gt;

== Effects==
Many effects of PAH exposure have been observed in marine fish. Specifically, studies have been conducted on the [[embryonic]] and [[larva]]l fish, the development of fish exposed to PAHs, and uptake of PAHs by fish via various routes of exposure. One study on found that [[Pacific herring]] eggs exposed to conditions mimicking the ‘’Exxon Valdez’’ oil spill resulted in premature hatching of eggs, reduced size as fish matured and significant [[teratogenic]] effects, including skeletal, cardiovascular, fin and yolk sac malformations.&lt;ref name="Carls et al. 1999" /&gt; Yolk sac [[edema]] was responsible for the majority of herring larval mortality.&lt;ref name="Carls et al. 1999" /&gt; The teratogenic malformations in the dorsal fin and spine, and in the jaw were observed to effectively decrease the survival of developing fish, through the impairing of swimming and feeding ability respectively. Feeding and prey avoidance via swimming are crucial for the survival of larval and juvenile fish.&lt;ref name="Carls et al. 1999" /&gt; All effects observed in herring eggs in the study were consistent with effects observed in exposed fish eggs following the ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill.&lt;ref name="Carls et al. 1999" /&gt; Zebrafish embryos exposed to oil were observed to have severe teratogenic defects similar to those seen in herring embryos, including edema, [[cardiac dysfunction]], and [[intracranial hemorrhages]].&lt;ref name="Incardona et al. 2005" /&gt; In a study focused on the uptake of PAHs by fish, salmon embryos were exposed to crude oil in three various situations, including via [[effluent]] from oil coated gravel.&lt;ref name="Heintz et al. 1999" /&gt; PAH concentrations in embryos directly exposed to oil and those exposed to PAH effluent were not significantly different. PAH exposure was observed to lead to death, even when the PAHs were exposed to fish via effluent. From the results, it was determined that fish embryos near the ''Exxon Valdez'' spill in Prince William Sound that were not directly in contact with oil still may have accumulated lethal levels of PAHs.&lt;ref name="Heintz et al. 1999" /&gt; While many laboratory and natural studies have observed significant adverse effects of PAH exposure to fish, a lack of effects has also been observed for certain PAH compounds, which could be due to a lack of uptake during exposure to the compound.&lt;ref name="Incardona et al. 2005" /&gt;

=== Proposed mechanism of toxic action ===
While it has been proven that different classes of PAHs act through distinct toxic mechanisms due to the variations in their molecular weight, ring arrangements, and water solubility properties, the specific mechanisms of PAH toxicity to fish and fish development are still unknown.&lt;ref name="Incardona et al. 2005" /&gt; Toxicity depends on the extent to which chemical in the oil will mix with water: this is referred to as the [[water associated fraction]] of the oil. The proposed mechanisms of toxicity of PAHs are toxicity through [[Unconsciousness|narcosis]], interaction with the AhR pathway, [[alkyl]] [[phenanthrene]] toxicity, and additive toxicity by multiple mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Barron et al. 2003"&gt;Barron MG, Carls MG, Heintz R, Rice SD. 2003. Evaluation of fish early-life stage toxicity models of chronic embryonic exposures to complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures. Oxford Journals. 78(1):60-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The narcosis model was not able to accurately predict the outcome of PAH mixture exposure of herring and pink salmon, according to a study.&lt;ref name="Barron et al. 2003" /&gt;
* The primary toxicity of these PAHs in fish embryos has been observed to be AhR independent, and their cardiac effects are not associated with AhR activation or [[Cytochrome P450]], family 1, member A induction in the [[endocardium]].&lt;ref name="Incardona et al. 2005" /&gt;
* The [[alkyl]] [[phenanthrene]] model has been studied by exposing herring and pink salmon to mixtures of PAHs in an attempt to better understand the toxicity mechanisms of PAHs. The model was found to generally predict the outcomes of sublethal and lethal exposures.&lt;ref name="Barron et al. 2003" /&gt; [[Oxidative stress]] and effects on [[cardiovascular]] [[morphogenesis]] are proposed mechanisms for alkyl phenanthrene toxicity.&lt;ref name="Barron et al. 2003" /&gt; The specific pathway is unknown.
* Since PAHs contain many different variations of PAHs, the toxicity may be explained by using multiple mechanisms of action.&lt;ref name="Barron et al. 2003" /&gt;

An '''optical illusion''' (also called a '''visual illusion'''&lt;ref&gt;In the scientific literature the term "visual illusion" is preferred because the older term gives rise to the assumption that the optics of the eye were the general cause for illusions (which is only the case for so-called ''physical illusions''). "Optical" in the term derives from the Greek ''optein'' = "seeing", so the term refers to an "illusion of seeing", not to [[optics]] as a branch of modern physics.

According to that, there are three main classes: physical, physiological, and cognitive illusions, and in each class there are four kinds: Ambiguities, distortions, paradoxes, and fictions. A classical example for a physical distortion would be the apparent bending of a stick half immerged in water; an example for a physiological paradox is the [[motion aftereffect]] (where despite movement position remains unchanged). An example for a physiological fiction is an [[afterimage]]. Three typical cognitive distortions are the [[Ponzo illusion|Ponzo]], [[Poggendorff illusion|Poggendorff]], and [[Müller-Lyer illusion|Müller-Lyer]] illusion. Physical illusions are caused by the physical environment, e.g. by the optical properties of water. Physiological illusions arise in the eye or the visual pathway, e.g. from the effects of excessive stimulation of a specific receptor type. [[Cognitive]] visual illusions are the result of [[unconscious inference]]s and are perhaps those most widely known.

[[Optical illusion#Pathological visual illusions|Pathological visual illusions]] arise from pathological changes in the physiological [[visual perception]] mechanisms causing the aforementioned types of illusions; they are discussed e.g. under [[hallucination#Visual|visual hallucinations]].

== Physical visual illusions ==
A familiar phenomenon and example for a physical visual illusion is when mountains appear to be much nearer in clear weather with low humidity ([[Foehn wind|Foehn]]) than they are. This is because haze is a cue for [[depth perception]] for far-away objects ([[Depth perception#Aerial perspective|Aerial perspective]]).

The classical example of a physical illusion is when a stick that is half immerged in water appears bent. This phenomenon has already been discussed by [[Ptolemy]] (ca. 150) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wade |first= Nicholas J. |date= 1998 |title= A natural history of vision |location= Cambridge, MA |publisher= MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was often a prototypical example for an illusion.

== Physiological visual illusions ==
Physiological illusions, such as the [[afterimage]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worqx.com/color/after_image.htm|title=After Images|work=worqx.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422033200/http://www.worqx.com/color/after_image.htm|archivedate=2015-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following bright lights, or adapting stimuli of excessively longer alternating patterns ([[contingent aftereffect|contingent perceptual aftereffect]]), are presumed to be the effects on the eyes or brain of excessive stimulation or interaction with contextual or competing stimuli of a specific type—brightness, color, position, tile, size, movement, etc. The theory is that a stimulus follows its individual dedicated neural path in the early stages of visual processing, and that intense or repetitive activity in that or interaction with active adjoining channels cause a [[physiological]] [[wikt:imbalance|imbalance]] that alters perception.

The Hermann [[grid illusion]] and [[Mach bands]] are two [[illusion]]s that are best explained using a biological approach. [[Lateral inhibition]], where in the [[receptive field]] of the retina light and dark receptors compete with one another to become active, has been used to explain why we see bands of increased brightness at the edge of a color difference when viewing Mach bands. Once a receptor is active, it inhibits adjacent receptors. This inhibition creates contrast, highlighting edges. In the Hermann grid illusion the gray spots appear at the intersection because of the inhibitory response which occurs as a result of the increased dark surround.&lt;ref&gt;Pinel, J. (2005) Biopsychology (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. {{ISBN|0-205-42651-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lateral inhibition]] has also been used to explain the Hermann [[grid illusion]], but [[grid illusion#Theories|this has been disproved]].

== Cognitive illusions ==
[[File:NeptunesGrottoOrganPlayer.jpg|thumb|right|"The Organ Player" - [[Pareidolia]] phenomenon in [[Neptune's Grotto]] [[stalactite]] cave ([[Alghero]], [[Sardinia]])]]
Cognitive illusions are assumed to arise by interaction with assumptions about the world, leading to "unconscious inferences", an idea first suggested in the 19th century by the [[Germany|German]] physicist and physician [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Hermann Helmholtz]].&lt;ref name="Eagleman2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Eagleman|title=Incogito: The Secret Lives of the Brain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nkPj3dNFYwoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT30&amp;q=Helmholtz#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=April 2012|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-307-38992-3|pages=33–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012233416/http://books.google.com/books?id=nkPj3dNFYwoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT30&amp;q=Helmholtz#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=12 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive illusions are commonly divided into [[ambiguous image|ambiguous illusions]], distorting illusions, paradox illusions, or fiction illusions.
# '''Ambiguous illusions''' are pictures or objects that elicit a perceptual "switch" between the alternative interpretations. The [[Necker cube]] is a well-known example; another instance is the [[Rubin vase]].
# '''Distorting''' or [[geometrical-optical illusions]] are characterized by distortions of size, length, position or curvature. A striking example is the [[Café wall illusion]]. Other examples are the famous [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] and [[Ponzo illusion]].
# '''Paradox illusions''' are generated by objects that are paradoxical or impossible, such as the [[Penrose triangle]] or [[Penrose staircase|impossible staircase]] seen, for example, in [[M. C. Escher]]'s ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' and ''[[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]''. The triangle is an illusion dependent on a cognitive misunderstanding that adjacent edges must join.
# '''Fictions''' are when a figure is perceived even though it is not in the stimulus.

== Explanation of cognitive illusions ==

=== Perceptual organization ===
[[File:Two silhouette profile or a white vase.jpg|thumb|Reversible figures and vase, or the [[Figure-ground (perception)|figure-ground]] illusion]]
&lt;!--Unsourced image removed: [[File:Illusion-9.gif|thumb|Left – Right Conflict]]--&gt;
[[File:Duck-Rabbit illusion.jpg|thumb|[[Rabbit–duck illusion]]]]

To make sense of the world it is necessary to organize incoming sensations into information which is meaningful. [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]] believe one way this is done is by perceiving individual sensory stimuli as a meaningful whole.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; Gestalt organization can be used to explain many illusions including the [[rabbit–duck illusion]] where the image as a whole switches back and forth from being a duck then being a rabbit and why in the [[Figure-ground (perception)|figure–ground]] illusion the figure and ground are reversible.

[[File:Kanizsa triangle.svg|thumb|alt=In this there is no "Drawn" White Triangle. Click caption for an explanation.|[[Kanizsa's Triangle]]]]
In addition, Gestalt theory can be used to explain the [[Illusory Contours|illusory contours]] in the [[Kanizsa's Triangle]]. A floating white triangle, which does not exist, is seen. The brain has a need to see familiar simple objects and has a tendency to create a "whole" image from individual elements.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;Myers, D. (2003). Psychology in Modules, (7th ed.) New York: Worth. {{ISBN|0-7167-5850-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gestalt means "form" or "shape" in German. However, another explanation of the Kanizsa's Triangle is based in [[evolutionary psychology]] and the fact that in order to survive it was important to see form and edges. The use of perceptual organization to create meaning out of stimuli is the principle behind other well-known illusions including [[impossible objects]]. Our brain makes sense of shapes and symbols putting them together like a jigsaw puzzle, formulating that which isn't there to that which is believable.

The Gestalt principles of perception govern the way we group different objects. Good form is where the perceptual system tries to fill in the blanks in order to see simple objects rather than complex objects. Continuity is where the perceptual system tries to disambiguate which segments fit together into continuous lines. Proximity is where objects that are close together are associated. Similarity is where objects that are similar are seen as associated. Some of these elements have been successfully incorporated into quantitative models involving optimal estimation or Bayesian inference.

The double-anchoring theory, a popular but recent theory of lightness illusions, states that any region belongs to one or more frameworks, created by Gestalt grouping principles, and within each framework is independently anchored to both the highest luminance and the surround luminance. A spot's lightness is determined by the average of the values computed in each framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bressan | first1 = P | year = 2006 | title = The Place of White in a World of Grays: A Double-Anchoring Theory of Lightness Perception | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 113 | issue = 3| pages = 526–553 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.113.3.526 | pmid=16802880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Depth and motion perception ===
[[File:Vertical–horizontal illusion.png|250px|left|thumb|The [[vertical–horizontal illusion]] where the vertical line is thought to be longer than the horizontal]]
[[File:Ponzo illusion.gif|left|thumb|alt=The Yellow lines are the same length. Click on the name at bottom of pictue for an explanation.|[[Ponzo illusion]]]]
Illusions can be based on an individual's ability to see in three dimensions even though the image hitting the retina is only two dimensional. The [[Ponzo illusion]] is an example of an illusion which uses monocular cues of depth perception to fool the eye. But even with two dimensional images, the brain exaggerates vertical distances when compared with horizontal distances, as in the [[vertical-horizontal illusion]] where the two lines are exactly the same length.

In the Ponzo illusion the converging [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel lines]] tell the brain that the image higher in the [[visual field]] is farther away therefore the brain perceives the image to be larger, although the two images hitting the [[retina]] are the same size. The optical illusion seen in a [[diorama]]/[[false perspective]] also exploits assumptions based on monocular cues of [[depth perception]]. The [[M.C. Escher]] painting ''[[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]'' exploits rules of depth and proximity and our understanding of the physical world to create an illusion. Like [[depth perception]], [[motion perception]] is responsible for a number of sensory illusions. Film [[animation]] is based on the illusion that the brain perceives a series of slightly varied images produced in rapid succession as a moving picture. Likewise, when we are moving, as we would be while riding in a vehicle, stable surrounding objects may appear to move. We may also perceive a large object, like an airplane, to move more slowly than smaller objects, like a car, although the larger object is actually moving faster. The [[phi phenomenon]] is yet another example of how the brain perceives motion, which is most often created by blinking lights in close succession.

The ambiguity of direction of motion due to lack of visual references for depth is shown in [[The Spinning Dancer|the spinning dancer illusion]].  The spinning dancer appears to be moving clockwise or counterclockwise depending on spontaneous activity in the brain where perception is subjective.  Recent studies show on the fMRI that there are spontaneous fluctuations in cortical activity while watching this illusion, particularly the parietal lobe, because it is involved in perceiving movement.&lt;ref&gt;Bernal, B., Guillen, M., &amp; Marquez, J. (2014). The spinning dancer illusion and spontaneous brain fluctuations: An fMRI study. Neurocase (Psychology Press), 20(6), 627-639.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Color and brightness constancies ===
[[File:Gradient-optical-illusion.svg|thumb|Simultaneous Contrast Illusion. The background is a [[color gradient]] and progresses from dark grey to light grey. The horizontal bar appears to progress from light grey to dark grey, but is in fact just one colour.]]
Perceptual constancies are sources of illusions. [[Color constancy]] and brightness constancy are responsible for the fact that a familiar object will appear the same color regardless of the amount of light or color of light reflecting from it. An illusion of color difference or luminosity difference can be created when the luminosity or color of the area surrounding an unfamiliar object is changed. The luminosity of the object will appear brighter against a black field (that reflects less light) compared to a white field, even though the object itself did not change in luminosity. Similarly, the eye will compensate for color contrast depending on the color cast of the surrounding area.

In addition to the Gestalt principles of perception, water-color illusions contribute to the formation of optical illusions. Water-color illusions consist of object-hole effects and coloration. Object-hole effects occur when boundaries are prominent where there is a figure and background with a hole that is 3D volumetric in appearance. Coloration consists of an assimilation of color radiating from a thin-colored edge lining a darker chromatic contour. The water-color illusion describes how the human mind perceives the wholeness of an object such as top-down processing.  Thus, contextual factors play into perceiving the brightness of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tanca | first1 = M. | last2 = Grossberg | first2 = S. | last3 = Pinna | first3 = B. | year = 2010 | title = Probing Perceptual Antinomies with the Watercolor Illusion and Explaining How the Brain Resolves Them | url = http://cns-web.bu.edu/%7Esteve/TanGroPin2010.pdf | journal = Seeing &amp; Perceiving | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 295–333 | doi = 10.1163/187847510x532685 | pmid = 21466146 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215931/http://cns-web.bu.edu/%7Esteve/TanGroPin2010.pdf | archivedate = 2017-09-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Object ===

Just as it perceives color and brightness constancies, the brain has the ability to understand familiar objects as having a consistent shape or size. For example, a door is perceived as rectangle regardless of how the image may change on the retina as the door is opened and closed. Unfamiliar objects, however, do not always follow the rules of shape constancy and may change when the perspective is changed. The Shepard illusion of the changing table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/sze_shepardTables/index.html |first=Michael |last=Bach |work=michaelbach.de |origyear=16 August 2004 |date=4 January 2010 |title=Shepard's "Turning the Tables" |accessdate=27 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5n6VqCltF?url=http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/sze_shepardTables/index.html |archivedate=27 January 2010 |publisher=Michael Bach |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of an illusion based on distortions in shape constancy.

=== Future perception ===

{{Dubious |Section "Future perception" questionable|date=September 2018}}

Researcher [[Mark Changizi]] of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in New York has a more imaginative take on optical illusions, saying that they are due to a neural lag which most humans experience while awake. When light hits the retina, about one-tenth of a second goes by before the brain translates the signal into a visual perception of the world. Scientists have known of the lag, yet they have debated how humans compensate, with some proposing that our motor system somehow modifies our movements to offset the delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bryner |first1=Jeanna |title=Scientist: Humans Can See Into Future |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/06/03/scientist-humans-can-see-into-future.html |website=foxnews.com |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changizi asserts that the human visual system has evolved to compensate for neural delays by generating images of what will occur one-tenth of a second into the future. This foresight enables humans to react to events in the present, enabling humans to perform reflexive acts like catching a fly ball and to maneuver smoothly through a crowd.&lt;ref name="Bryner"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/080602-foresee-future.html Key to All Optical Illusions Discovered] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905122802/http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/080602-foresee-future.html |date=2008-09-05 }}'', Jeanna Bryner, Senior Writer, LiveScience.com 6/2/08. His research on this topic is detailed in the May/June 2008 issue of the journal ''Cognitive Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ABC Changizi said, "Illusions occur when our brains attempt to perceive the future, and those perceptions don't match reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=NIERENBERG |first1=CARI |title=Optical Illusions: When Your Brain Can't Believe Your Eyes |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/EyeHealth/optical-illusions-eye-brain-agree/story?id=8455573 |website=ABC News |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an illusion called the [[Hering illusion]] looks like bicycle spokes around a central point, with vertical lines on either side of this central, so-called vanishing point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barile |first1=Margherita |title=Hering Illusion |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeringIllusion.html |website=mathworld |publisher=Wolfram |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The illusion tricks us into thinking we are looking at a perspective picture, and thus according to Changizi, switches on our future-seeing abilities. Since we aren't actually moving and the figure is static, we misperceive the straight lines as curved ones.
Changizi said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Evolution has seen to it that geometric drawings like this elicit in us premonitions of the near future. The converging lines toward a vanishing point (the spokes) are cues that trick our brains into thinking we are moving forward—as we would in the real world, where the door frame (a pair of vertical lines) seems to bow out as we move through it—and we try to perceive what that world will look like in the next instant.&lt;ref name="Bryner" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Pathological visual illusions ==
A [[pathology|pathological]] visual illusion is a distortion of a real external stimulus&lt;ref name=Pelak&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pelak|first1=Victoria|title=Approach to the patient with visual hallucinations|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations|website=www.uptodate.com|accessdate=2014-08-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120056/http://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations|archivedate=2014-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often diffuse and persistent. Pathological visual illusions usually occur throughout the visual field, suggesting global excitability or sensitivity alterations.&lt;ref name=Gersztenkorn&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gersztenkorn|first1=D|last2=Lee|first2=AG|title=Palinopsia revamped: A systematic review of the literature|journal=Survey of ophthalmology|date=Jul 2, 2014|pmid=25113609|doi=10.1016/j.survophthal.2014.06.003|volume=60|issue=1|pages=1–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively visual hallucination is the perception of an external visual stimulus where none exists.&lt;ref name=Pelak /&gt; Visual hallucinations are often from focal dysfunction and are usually transient.

Types of visual illusions include [[oscillopsia]], [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halos around objects]], [[illusory palinopsia]] ([[illusory palinopsia#Visual trailing|visual trailing]], [[illusory palinopsia#Light streaking|light streaking]], [[Illusory palinopsia#Prolonged indistinct afterimage|prolonged indistinct afterimages]]), [[akinetopsia]], [[visual snow]], [[micropsia]], [[macropsia]], [[teleopsia]], [[pelopsia]], [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]], [[metamorphopsia]], [[dyschromatopsia]], intense [[glare (vision)|glare]], [[blue field entoptic phenomenon]], and [[entoptic phenomena|purkinje trees]].

These symptoms may indicate an underlying disease state and necessitate seeing a medical practitioner. Etiologies associated with pathological visual illusions include multiple types of [[eye disease|ocular disease]], [[migraine]]s, [[hallucinogen persisting perception disorder]], [[closed head injury|head trauma]], and [[prescription drug]]s. If a medical work-up does not reveal a cause of the pathological visual illusions, the idiopathic visual disturbances could be analogous to the altered excitability state seen in visual aura with no migraine headache. If the visual illusions are diffuse and persistent, they often affect the patient's quality of life. These symptoms are often refractory to treatment and may be caused by any of the aforementioned etiologes, but are often idiopathic. There is no standard treatment for these visual disturbances.

== List of illusions ==
There are a variety of different types of optical illusions. Many are included in the following list.
{{Main|List of optical illusions}}

== In art ==
Artists who have worked with optical illusions include [[M. C. Escher]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], [[Patrick Bokanowski]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Oscar Reutersvärd]], [[Victor Vasarely]] and [[Charles Allan Gilbert]]. Contemporary artists who have experimented with illusions include [[Jonty Hurwitz]], [[Sandro del Prete]], [[Octavio Ocampo]], [[Dick Termes]], [[Shigeo Fukuda]], [[Patrick Hughes (artist)|Patrick Hughes]], [[István Orosz]], [[Rob Gonsalves]], [[Gianni A. Sarcone]], [[Ben Heine]] and [[Akiyoshi Kitaoka]]. Optical illusion is also used in film by the technique of [[forced perspective]].

[[Op art]] is a style of art that uses optical illusions to create an impression of movement, or hidden images and patterns. ''[[Trompe-l'œil]]''
uses realistic imagery to create the optical illusion that depicted objects exist in three dimensions.

== Cognitive processes hypothesis ==
The hypothesis claims that visual illusions occur because the neural circuitry in our visual system evolves, by neural learning, to a system that makes very efficient interpretations of usual 3D scenes based in the emergence of simplified models in our brain that speed up the interpretation process but give rise to optical illusions in unusual situations. In this sense, the cognitive processes hypothesis can be considered a framework for an understanding of optical illusions as the signature of the empirical statistical way vision has evolved to solve the inverse problem.&lt;ref name="knowperc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardgregory.org/papers/knowl_illusion/knowledge-in-perception.pdf |format=PDF |title=Knowledge in perception and illusion |first=Richard L. |last=Gregory |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404073125/http://www.richardgregory.org/papers/knowl_illusion/knowledge-in-perception.pdf |archivedate=2005-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that 3D vision capabilities emerge and are learned jointly with the planning of movements. After a long process of learning, an internal representation of the world emerges that is well-adjusted to the perceived data coming from closer objects. The representation of distant objects near the horizon is less "adequate". In fact, it is not only the Moon that seems larger when we perceive it near the horizon. In a photo of a distant scene, all distant objects are perceived as smaller than when we observe them directly using our vision.

The retinal image is the main source driving vision but what we see is a "virtual" 3D representation of the scene in front of us. We don't see a physical image of the world; we see objects, and the physical world is not itself separated into objects. We see it according to the way our brain organizes it. The names, colours, usual shapes and other information about the things we see pop up instantaneously from our neural circuitry and influence the representation of the scene. We "see" the most relevant information about the elements of the best 3D image that our neural networks can produce. &lt;!--I'm commenting this next sentence out because I believe that brightness, colour and shape are real physical properties ......The perceived properties of the objects, such as brightness, angular size, and colour, are unconsciously "determined" and are not real physical properties.--&gt; The illusions arise when the "judgments" implied in the unconscious analysis of the scene are in conflict with reasoned considerations about it.

[[Image:Satellite image of Noordoostpolder, Netherlands (5.78E 52.71N).png|thumb|right|[[Satellite imagery|Satellite image]] of [[Noordoostpolder]], [[Netherlands]] (595.41&amp;nbsp;km²)]] 

A '''polder''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈpɔldər|-|Nl-polder.ogg}}) is a low-lying tract of land enclosed by [[dike (construction)|dikes]] that form an artificial [[hydrology|hydrological]] entity, meaning it has no connection with outside water other than through manually operated devices. There are three types of polder:
# [[Land reclamation|Land reclaimed]] from a body of water, such as a lake or the [[sea|sea bed]]
# [[Flood plain]]s separated from the sea or river by a dike
# [[Marshes]] separated from the surrounding water by a dike and subsequently drained; these are also known as ''[[koog]]s'' especially in Germany

The ground level in drained marshes [[Subsidence|subsides]] over time. All polders will eventually be below the surrounding water level some or all of the time. Water enters the low-lying polder through [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and water pressure of [[ground water]], or rainfall, or transport of water by rivers and canals. This usually means that the polder has an excess of water, which is pumped out or drained by opening [[sluice]]s at [[low tide]]. Care must be taken not to set the internal water level too low. Polder land made up of [[peat]] (former marshland) will sink in relation to its previous level, because of peat decomposing when exposed to oxygen from the air. 
 
Polders are at risk from flooding at all times, and care must be taken to protect the surrounding dikes. Dikes are typically built with locally available materials, and each material has its own risks: sand is prone to collapse owing to saturation by water; dry peat is lighter than water and potentially unable to retain water in very dry seasons. Some animals dig tunnels in the barrier, allowing water to infiltrate the structure; the [[muskrat]] is known for this activity and hunted in certain European countries because of it. Polders are most commonly, though not exclusively, found in river deltas, former [[fen]]lands and coastal areas.

Flooding of polders has also been used as a military tactic in the past. One example is the flooding of the polders along the [[Yser]] river during [[World War I]]. Opening the sluices at high tide and closing them at low tide turned the polders into an inaccessible swamp which allowed the Allied armies to stop the German army.

==Etymology==
From [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''polder'' ("polder"), from [[Middle Dutch]] ''polre'', from [[Old Dutch]] ''polra'', ultimately from ''pol-'' "part of land, elevated above its surroundings"; with [[augmentative]] suffix ''-er'' and [[Epenthesis|epenthetical]] '' -d-''.

==Polders and the Netherlands==
[[Image:Gemaal de Leyens.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Pumping station in [[Zoetermeer]], [[Netherlands]]. The polder lies lower than the surrounding water on the other side of the dike. The [[Archimedes' screw]]s are clearly visible.]] 
The [[Netherlands]] is frequently associated with polders, as its engineers became noted for developing techniques to drain wetlands and make them usable for agriculture and other development. This is illustrated by the saying: "God created the world, but the Dutch created the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=3HjRCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=origin+of+phrase+%22God+created+the+world%2C+but+the+Dutch+created+the+Netherlands%22.&amp;q=%22God+created+the+world%2C+but+the+Dutch+created+the+Netherlands%22.#v=snippet&amp;q=%22God%20created%20the%20world%2C%20but%20the%20Dutch%20created%20the%20Netherlands%22.&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;". 

The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] have a long history of reclamation of marshes and fenland, resulting in some 3,000 ''polders''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/rws/waterinnovatiebron/cgi-bin/toonlijst.pl?config=config&amp;var=volgnr&amp;val=1&amp;layout=index-forceframe&amp;confignr=1&amp;menu=1067260347&amp;menuitem=1120115781| publisher=Rijkswaterstaat| title=''Kijk naar de geschiedenis''| accessdate=2008-01-21}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; nationwide. By 1961 {{convert|6800|sqmi}}, about half of the country's land, was reclaimed from the sea.&lt;ref name="ley196110"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half the total surface area of ''polders'' in north-west Europe is in the Netherlands. The first [[embankment dam|embankments]] in Europe were constructed in Roman times. The first polders were constructed in the 11th century. 

As a result of flooding disasters, [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water board]]s called ''waterschap'' (when situated more inland) or ''hoogheemraadschap'' (near the sea, mainly used in the [[Holland]] region)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=waterschap|url = http://www.waterschappen.nl/mijn-waterschap.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102142234/http://www.waterschappen.nl/|archivedate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were set up to maintain the integrity of the water defences around polders, maintain the waterways inside a polder, and control the various water levels inside and outside the polder. Water boards hold separate elections, levy taxes, and function independently from other government bodies. Their function is basically unchanged even today. As such they are the oldest democratic institution in the country. The necessary cooperation among all ranks to maintain polder integrity gave its name to the Dutch version of [[Third Way (centrism)|third way politics]]—the ''[[Polder Model]]''.

The [[North Sea flood of 1953|1953 flood disaster]] prompted a new approach to the design of dikes and other water-retaining structures, based on an acceptable probability of overflowing. Risk is defined as the product of probability and consequences. The potential damage in lives, property and rebuilding costs is compared to the potential cost of water defences. From these calculations follows an acceptable flood risk from the sea at one in 4,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;years, while it is one in 100–2,500&amp;nbsp;years for a river flood. The particular established policy guides the Dutch government to improve flood defences as new data on threat levels becomes available. 

Some famous Dutch polders and the year they were laid dry are:
* [[Beemster]] (1609-1612)
* [[Schermer]] (1633-1635)
* [[Haarlemmermeerpolder]] (1852)
* As part of the [[Zuiderzee Works]]:
** [[Wieringermeerpolder]] (1930)
** [[Noordoostpolder]] (1942)
** [[Flevopolder]] (1956-1966)

== Examples of polders ==
===Bangladesh===
Bangladesh has 123 polders, of which 49 are sea-facing. These were constructed in the 1960s to protect the coast from tidal flooding and reduce salinity incursion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report/98292/bangladesh-polders-under-threat "Bangladesh polders under threat"], Irin News&lt;/ref&gt; They reduce long-term flooding and waterlogging following [[storm surge]]s from [[tropical cyclone]]s. They are also cultivated for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unearthnews.org/2013/07/17/bangladeshi-project-to-enhance-polders-amidst-climate-woes/ "Bangladeshi project to enhance polders amidst climate woes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408091108/http://unearthnews.org/2013/07/17/bangladeshi-project-to-enhance-polders-amidst-climate-woes/ |date=2014-04-08 }}, Unearth News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed hunting===
The [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian parliament]] discussed in September 2008 a bill aiming to open 13 national parks to sustainable [[hunting]], in order to manage the wildlife [[biodiversity]] in these areas and promote greater tourism and the accompanying revenue necessary to support and maintain the parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lege5.ro/Gratuit/gezdmnrxgm/legea-nr-215-2008-pentru-modificarea-si-completarea-legii-vanatorii-si-a-protectiei-fondului-cinegetic-nr-407-2006 |title=Legea nr. 215/2008 pentru modificarea şi completarea Legii vânătorii şi a protecţiei fondului cinegetic nr. 407/2006 |work=Lege5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after several protests from environmental organizations, the law was rejected by President [[Traian Băsescu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.formula-as.ro/2009/851/ecologie-14/cum-au-fost-salvate-de-glontul-pustii-animalele-din-parcurile-nationale-ale-romaniei-10629 |title=Cum au fost salvate de glontul pustii animalele din Parcurile Nationale ale Romaniei |journal=Formula AS |date=2009 |issue=851 |author=Bogdana Tihon Buliga}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, hunting is prohibited in national parks of Romania.

==Natural reserves==
Natural reserves are natural areas protected by law in order to protect and conserve important habitats and natural species. The dimensions of natural reserves vary and depend on the area needed by protected natural elements. Besides scientific activities, the administrations of natural reserves encourage traditional activities and [[ecotourism]] that do not affect the natural landscape. Here is not permitted to use [[natural resource]]s.

There are 617 natural reservations totaling 2,043.55&amp;nbsp;km².

==Scientific reserves==
Scientific reserves are also protected areas that, like the previous ones, aim at protection and preservation of natural habitats. The difference is that scientific reserves can not be visited by tourists. These areas typically contain rare plant and animal species or particular natural elements, reason why here are prohibited any human activities, excepting research and education activities. Entry without permission in scientific reserves is punishable by considerable fines.

There are 55 such reservations totaling 1,112.77&amp;nbsp;km².

==Natural monuments==
There are 234 natural monuments totaling 77.05&amp;nbsp;km².

==Research history==
In 1759 [[Giovanni Arduino (geologist)|Giovanni Arduino]] proposed that the geological strata of northern [[Italy]] could be divided into four successive formations or "orders" ({{lang-it|quattro ordini}}).&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{cite journal |last1=Arduino |first1=Giovanni |title=Lettera Segonda di Giovanni Arduino … sopra varie sue osservazioni fatte in diverse parti del territorio di Vicenza, ed altrove, apparenenti alla Teoria terrestre, ed alla Mineralogia |journal=Nuova Raccolta d'Opuscoli Scientifici e Filologici [New collection of scientific and philogical pamphlets] |date=1760 |volume=6 |pages=133 (cxxxiii)–180(clxxx) |trans-title=Second letter of Giovani Arduino … on his various observations made in different parts of the territory of Vincenza, and elsewhere, concerning the theory of the earth and mineralogy |language=Italian}}  Available at: [https://bibdig.museogalileo.it/Teca/Viewer;jsessionid=3160EE486323866602B9590459D7111B?an=323812_6 Museo Galileo (Florence (Firenze), Italy)]  From p. 158 (clviii):  ''"Per quanto ho potuto sinora osservavare, la serie di questi strati, che compongono la corteccia visibile della terra, mi pare distinta in quattro ordini generali, e successivi, senza considerarvi il mare."'' (As far as I have been able to observe, the series of these layers that compose the visible crust of the earth seems to me distinct in four general orders, and successive, not considering the sea.)

Part 2. |journal=Earth Sciences History |date=2012 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=168–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "quaternary" was introduced by [[Jules Desnoyers]] in 1829 for sediments of [[France]]'s [[Seine]] Basin that seemed clearly to be younger than [[Tertiary]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] [[rock (geology)|rocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Desnoyers |first1=J. |title=Observations sur un ensemble de dépôts marins plus récents que les terrains tertiaires du bassin de la Seine, et constituant une formation géologique distincte; précédées d'un aperçu de la nonsimultanéité des bassins tertiares |journal=Annales des sciences naturelles |date=1829 |volume=16 |pages=171-214, 402-491 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/29350#page/177/mode/1up |trans-title=Observations on a set of marine deposits [that are] more recent than the tertiary terrains of the Seine basin and [that] constitute a distinct geological formation; preceded by an outline of the non-simultaneity of tertiary basins |language=French}} [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/29350#page/199/mode/1up From p. 193:]  ''"Ce que je désirerais … dont il faut également les distinguer."'' (What I would desire to prove above all is that the series of tertiary deposits continued – and even began in the more recent basins – for a long time, perhaps after that of the Seine had been completely filled, and that these later formations – ''Quaternary'' (1), so to say – should not retain the name of alluvial deposits any more than the true and ancient tertiary deposits, from which they must also be distinguished.)  However, on the very same page, Desnoyers abandoned the use of the term "quaternary" because the distinction between quaternary and tertiary deposits wasn't clear.  From p. 193:  ''"La crainte de voir mal comprise … que ceux du bassin de la Seine."'' (The fear of seeing my opinion in this regard be misunderstood or exaggerated, has made me abandon the word "quaternary", which at first I had wanted to apply to all deposits more recent than those of the Seine basin.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/77123/8/08_chapter%201.pdf|title=Late Quaternary Fluvial and Coastal Sequences Chapter 1: Introduction|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wiz Science™|title=Quaternary - Video Learning - WizScience.com|date=2015-09-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io7vhansU1o|accessdate=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quaternary Period follows the [[Neogene]] Period and extends to the present. The Quaternary covers the time span of [[glacier|glaciations]] classified as the [[Pleistocene]], and includes the present interglacial time-period, the [[Holocene]].

This places the start of the Quaternary at the onset of [[Northern Hemisphere]] glaciation approximately 2.6 million years ago. Prior to 2009, the Pleistocene was defined to be from 1.805 million years ago to the present, so the current definition of the Pleistocene includes a portion of what was, prior to 2009, defined as the [[Pliocene]].

{{Quaternary (period)}}
&lt;!--[old table]--&gt;
Quaternary stratigraphers usually worked with regional subdivisions. From the 1970s, the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS) tried to make a single geologic time scale based on [[GSSP]]'s, which could be used internationally. The Quaternary subdivisions were defined based on [[biostratigraphy]] instead of [[paleoclimate]].

This led to the problem that the proposed base of the Pleistocene was at 1.805 Mya, long after the start of the major glaciations of the northern hemisphere. The ICS then proposed to abolish use of the name Quaternary altogether, which appeared unacceptable to the [[International Union for Quaternary Research]] (INQUA).

In 2009, it was decided to make the Quaternary the youngest period of the [[Cenozoic]] Era with its base at 2.588 Mya and including the [[Gelasian]] stage, which was formerly considered part of the Neogene Period and Pliocene Epoch.&lt;ref name="ICS2009"&gt;[http://www.quaternary.stratigraphy.org.uk/correlation/GSAchron09.jpg See the 2009 version of the ICS geologic time scale]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anthropocene]] has been proposed as a third epoch as a mark of the anthropogenic impact on the global environment starting with the [[Industrial Revolution]], or about 200 years ago.&lt;ref name="Zalasiewicz2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zalasiewicz |first1=J. |last2=Williams |first2=M. |last3=Haywood |first3=A. |last4=Ellis |first4=M. |title=The Anthropocene: a new epoch of geological time? |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A |date=2011 |volume=369 |issue=1938 |pages=835–841 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0339 |ref=Zalasiewicz2011 |pmid=21282149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anthropocene is not officially designated by the ICS, however, but a working group is currently aiming to complete a proposal for the creation of an epoch or sub-period by 2016.&lt;ref name="Anthrogroup"&gt;{{cite web |title=Working Group on the 'Anthropocene'|url=http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/|website=Subcomission on Quaternary Stratigraphy|accessdate=16 June 2014|ref=Anthrogroup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
{{further|Quaternary geology}}
The 2.6 million years of the Quaternary represents the time during which recognizable humans existed. Over this geologically short time period, there has been relatively little change in the distribution of the continents due to [[plate tectonics]].

The Quaternary geological record is preserved in greater detail than that for earlier periods.

The major geographical changes during this time period included the emergence of the Strait of [[Bosphorus]] and [[Skagerrak]] during glacial epochs, which respectively turned the [[Black Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] into fresh water, followed by their flooding (and return to salt water) by rising sea level; the periodic filling of the [[English Channel]], forming a land bridge between Britain and the European mainland; the periodic closing of the [[Bering Strait]], forming [[Beringia|the land bridge between Asia and North America]]; and the periodic flash flooding of [[Scablands]] of the American Northwest by glacial water.

The current extent of [[Hudson Bay]], the [[Great Lakes]] and other major lakes of North America are a consequence of the [[Canadian Shield]]'s readjustment since the last ice age; different shorelines have existed over the course of Quaternary time.

==Climate==
{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}
The [[climate]] was one of periodic glaciations with continental glaciers moving as far from the poles as 40 degrees [[latitude]]. There was a major extinction of large mammals in Northern areas at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch. Many forms such as [[saber-toothed cat]]s, [[mammoth]]s, [[mastodon]]s, [[glyptodon]]ts, etc., became [[extinction|extinct]] worldwide. Others, including [[horse]]s, [[Camelops|camels]] and [[American cheetah]]s became extinct in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.unr.edu/cla/anthro/people/faculty/haynes/download%20Haynes+StanfordCamelops.pdf|title =Stanford Camelops|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =Haynes|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140309104319/http://www.unr.edu/cla/anthro/people/faculty/haynes/download%20Haynes+StanfordCamelops.pdf|archivedate =2014-03-09|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Extinct American Cheetah Fact Sheet|url = http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheets/_extinct/cheetah1_american/cheetah1_american.html|website = library.sandiegozoo.org|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quaternary glaciation==
{{Main|Quaternary glaciation}}
Glaciation took place repeatedly during the Quaternary [[Ice Age]]&amp;nbsp;– a term coined by Schimper in 1839 that began with the start of the Quaternary about 2.58 Mya and continues to the present day.

===Last glacial period===
[[File:IceAgeEarth.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of Earth during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]]]
{{Main|Last glacial period}}
In 1821, a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] engineer, [[Ignaz Venetz]], presented an article in which he suggested the presence of traces of the passage of a glacier at a considerable distance from the Alps. This idea was initially disputed by another Swiss scientist, [[Louis Agassiz]], but when he undertook to disprove it, he ended up affirming his colleague's hypothesis. A year later, Agassiz raised the hypothesis of a great glacial period that would have had long-reaching general effects. This idea gained him international fame and led to the establishment of the Glacial Theory.

In time, thanks to the refinement of geology, it has been demonstrated that there were several periods of glacial advance and retreat and that past temperatures on Earth were very different from today.
In particular, the [[Milankovitch cycles]] of [[Milutin Milankovitch]] are based on the premise that variations in incoming [[solar radiation]] are a fundamental factor controlling Earth's climate.

During this time, substantial glaciers advanced and retreated over much of North America and Europe, parts of South America and Asia, and all of Antarctica. The [[Great Lakes]] formed and giant mammals thrived in parts of North America and Eurasia not covered in ice. These mammals became extinct when the glacial period Age ended about 11,700 years ago. Modern [[humans]] evolved about 315,000 years ago. During the Quaternary Period, mammals, flowering plants, and insects dominated the land. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12521">The '''Rosenfeld Effect''' is not a [[phenomenon|scientific phenomena]], but an [[empirical]] [[fact]] that [[electricity]] use [[per capita]] in [[California]] (CA) had been almost flat from 1973 to 2006, whereas use in the United States has risen 50%.&lt;ref name=TheArtofEnergyEfficiency&gt;"The Rosenfeld Effect in California: The ''Art'' of Energy Efficiency." ''Natural Resource Defense Council''. California Energy Commission, n.d. Web. 16 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is attributed to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], a cause pioneered by [[Arthur H. Rosenfeld]]. Up until 2010 Dr. Rosenfeld was the commissioner and a very prominent member of the California Energy Commission board&lt;ref name=SD&gt;Sudarshan, Anant. "Deconstructing the Rosenfeld curve: Making sense of California's low electricity intensity." Energy Economics. Vol. 39, September 2013, Pages 197-207. Web. 21 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and presided over the Research, Development, and Demonstration Committee; the Dynamic Pricing Committee; and the Energy Efficiency Committee,&lt;ref name=GraphGWH&gt; Rosenfeld H. &amp; Poskanzer. "A Graph is Worth a Thousand Gigawatt-Hours: How California Came to Lead the United States in Energy Efficiency." ''Innovations Case Narrative'': The California Effect. 2009. Web. 24 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; whose main purposes are to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to support cutting edge research and, to look towards developing renewable energy sources. 

A [[Meeting|conference]] in 2006 at [[UC Berkeley]] was dedicated to the Rosenfeld Effect.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.,  [http://webcast.berkeley.edu/events/details.php?webcastid=15730 "Energy Symposium: The Rosenfeld Effect" April 28, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Energy Symposium conference on the Rosenfeld Effect was to inform people of the role increased energy efficiency plays in California, China, Russia, and on a much larger global scale.

According to Dr. Rosenfeld, as time progresses, new technological breakthroughs make electrical appliances more efficient and longer lasting than their older counterparts.&lt;ref name=ArthurRosenfeld&gt;"Summing Up Energy Symposium: The "Rosenfeld Effect." ''California Energy Commission.'' California Energy Commission, 28 Apr. 2006. Web. 17 Nov 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when refrigerators were made in 1974, the model consumed four times as much energy compared to refrigerators manufactured in 2001.&lt;ref name="ArthurRosenfeld"/&gt; As the appliances became more efficient, they would save more energy, which consequently lowered the amount of money the average person paid for electricity to keep the appliance running. The cheaper cost of higher efficiency is also the premise behind [[Rosenfeld's Law]], which is also attributed to Rosenfeld. Rosenfeld believed that reasonable standards for energy efficiency in numerous appliances could guarantee a drastic reduction in energy consumption. As opposed to national precedents set in the early 1990s, California's earlier standards for energy efficiency contributed much to these technological discoveries.&lt;ref name="SD"/&gt;

The Rosenfeld Effect is often associated with the following two [[chart]]s:
# [[Energy]] per capita vs [[time]], comparing the US and California
# Estimated energy savings in California from [[efficiency]] [[Technical standard|standards]] and programs

The first graph is Figure 1 of the 2007 California Integrated Energy Policy Report&lt;ref&gt;2007 Integrated Policy Report. ''California Energy Commissions''. December 5, 2007. Web. 22 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes referred to as the Rosenfeld Curve. The second is widely used in [[Slide show|Powerpoint presentations]].&lt;ref&gt;"Rosenfeld, Where Art Thou Rosenfeld?" ''Open Source Economics''. February 25, 2009. Web. 20 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Natural Resource Defense Council (NRDC), a [[special interest group]] independent of the California Energy Commission, released a document in 2005 detailing the energy per capita of the state of California as well as the energy per capita of the United States as a whole. From 1976 to 2005, California's energy per capita fluctuated around 6,500 kilowatt-hours per capita whereas the US roughly went from 8,000 kilowatt-hours to 12,000 kilowatt-hours per capita.&lt;ref name="TheArtofEnergyEfficiency"/&gt; The document also states that Rosenfeld's titles, such as titles 20 and 24, which are responsible for setting energy efficiency standards, have saved California from needing to build 21 power plants.&lt;ref name="TheArtofEnergyEfficiency"/&gt; For California's per capita energy consumption to remain constant as the growing population increased its dependence on electricity, increases in efficiency had to keep up with electricity's increasing utility. The article also credits Rosenfeld's energy saving targets, his focus on research and development, his ability to integrate energy efficiency into resource procurement, his provision of "performance-based incentives",  his capability to motivate utility companies to segregate revenues from sales, his willingness to have progress towards targets measured by a third party, and his implementation of "well-designed programs" as additional reasons for California's leadership in energy efficiency.&lt;ref name="TheArtofEnergyEfficiency"/&gt; One "well-designed program" the article cites is the subsidization of [[compact fluorescent lamps]] and how different methods were undertaken to make the cost drop from $25 a bulb in the 1980s to $3 a bulb in 2005, which saved a typical Californian family on average of about $1000 per year. &lt;ref name="TheArtofEnergyEfficiency"/&gt; The NRDC estimates California saves approximately $42 billion a year from just four of Rosenfeld's initiatives: the invention of DOE-2 (a computer program that builds energy analysis&lt;ref name="DrPrem"&gt;"Arthur H. Rosenfeld: Energy efficiency 'guru' all set to call it a day." ''Dr. Prem''. Dr. Prem, n.d. Web. 20 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;--$10 billion per year) and the implementation of high-frequency ballasts ($5 billion per year), low-e windows (estimated $5-$10 billion per year), and more efficient refrigerators ($17 billion per year).&lt;ref name="TheArtofEnergyEfficiency"/&gt; Beyond saving energy and money, Rosenfeld's actions at California's Energy Commission have also helped paint California as an example to the United States in [[carbon dioxide]] emissions, setting California's per capita emissions to half the national average in 2000.&lt;ref name="TheArtofEnergyEfficiency"/&gt;

Beyond setting standards and implementing programs, Rosenfeld and the California Energy Commission have invested money into research and development. The NRDC cites the following programs: the California Energy Commission's Public Interest Energy Research Program (PIER), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Center for Building Science, California Public Utilities Commission's Emerging Technologies Fund (CETF), and the California Clean Energy Fund (CalCEF),&lt;ref name="TheArtofEnergyEfficiency"/&gt; all of which are focused on finding new ways to save energy, by finding new technology or ways that can help the everyday person use less power from the grid.

According to its staff, PIER allocates grants to various companies investing in energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=PIER&gt;"Growth in the Green Economy: PIER Contributes to Job Growth and Private Investment." ''PIER''. California Energy Commission, n.d. Web. 21 Nov. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The document PIER staff provides on the California Energy Commission's website includes an example of a funded company: Altex Technologies Corporation, which researches technologies for fuel cells and boiler burners.&lt;ref name=PIER/&gt;  The staff behind PIER estimates the program has also directly and indirectly created roughly 50,000 jobs since its imitation in 1996.&lt;ref name=PIER/&gt;

Funding for the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Center for Building Science was to discover ways to limit energy waste. After sufficient testing, the applications team released a guide on how to design a research laboratory in a more energy efficiency manner.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;"A Design Guide for Energy-Efficient Research Laboratories." ''Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Center for Building Science Applications Team''. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Center for Building Science, August 2003. Web. 21 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The guide includes suggestions for how to properly set air filtration, lighting, and supply, exhaust, and distribution systems for optimal efficiency.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"/&gt; 

The CETF stated its primary goals include managing telecommunication mergers and helping strengthen the broadband Internet infrastructure of California, with saving energy an indirect result of its procedures.&lt;ref name=CETF&gt;"Mission." ''California Emerging Technology Fund''. California Emerging Technology Fund, n.d. Web. 21 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The California Public Utilities Commission writes that in 2010 the CETF considered its work complete and disbanded.&lt;ref name=Disband&gt;"California Merging Technology Fund." ''California Public Utilities Commission''. California Public Utilities Commission, n.d. 21 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

CalCEF is a non-profit program that hopes to transition to a clean energy economy by creating and supporting institutions that grow markets for clean energy technologies. CalCEF is partnered with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and according to a CalCEF press release published in December 2012, the U.S. Department of Energy granted $120 million to upgrade the California storage accelerator.&lt;ref&gt;"$120 Million DOE Grant Boosts California Energy Storage Accelerator." ''CalCEF''. News Press Coverage. December 12. 2012. Web. 21 Nov. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

While the energy per capita began to rise post-2006 for California, Rosenfeld still took initiative to manage California's energy consumption. In September 2005, the California Public Utilities Commission authorized a $2.7 billion investment from 2006-2008 to save ratepayers $5.4 billion and to save California from having to expend resources in order to build three additional power plants.&lt;ref&gt;"D0509043." ''California Public Utilities Commission''. California Public Utilities Commission, 27 September 2005. Web. 19 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenfeld's work has motivated others to conserve energy. For example, In April 2006, Ashok Gadgil of Lawrence Berkelely International Laboratory gave a presentation detailing international examples of the Rosenfeld Effect in practical use, which included programs making compact fluorescent lamps more cost-effective for poorer countries; distributing energy efficient water filters to the Philippines, Mexico, and India; and distributing metal cook-stoves with an increased efficiency factor of four in contrast to its predecessor to poor citizens of Sudan and Darfur refugees displaced by conflict in that region.&lt;ref&gt;"The Rosenfeld Effect: International examples [sic]." ''UC Berkeley''. California Energy Commission, 29 Apr. 2006. Web. 16 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the extensive work and research put behind the Rosenfeld Effect, information presented by Dr. Rosenfeld himself illustrates how several areas of crucial interest were taken into account: investigating the science and engineering of energy end-use, assessing potential and theoretical opportunities for energy efficiency, developing analytic and economic models to quantify opportunities , and researching and developing new equipment and processes to make these opportunities a success.&lt;ref name=GraphGWH/&gt; Dr. Rosenfeld’s main motivation for improving energy efficiency was to save money as well as save resources such as oil, gas, and forests for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld H., Arthur. "The Art of Energy Efficiency: Protecting the Environment with Better Technology." 1999. Web. 22 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose behind the Rosenfeld effect was not only to set an example in high efficiency standards, but also to curb the threat of carbon-emissions which lead to greenhouse gases and thus further threat of [[global warming]].  By making energy use more efficient humans would be burning less fossil fuel for energy consumption. This decreased carbon emissions by more than 3 million tons per year by the year 2008, which is the equivalent of taking 650,000 cars off the road.&lt;ref name="TheArtofEnergyEfficiency"/&gt;

The '''''State of the Climate''''' is an annual report that is primarily led by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] [[National Climatic Data Center]] (NOAA/NCDC), located in Asheville, North Carolina, but whose leadership and authorship spans roughly 100 institutions in about 50 countries.

== Release ==
The report appears as a supplement to a summer issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]]'' (BAMS), a publication of the [[American Meteorological Society]]. The State of the Climate report, known until 2001 as the ''Climate Assessment'', is an international effort.

==  State of the Climate in 2010 ==
The 2010 edition (released June 28, 2011) contained submissions from 368 authors from 45 nations and covered 41 climate indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/bams-sotc/2010/webinar-briefing-slides.pdf State of the Climate in 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 edition contained a highlights document that summarized the major findings of the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/bams-state-of-the-climate/2010.php BAMS State of the Climate - 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The State of the Climate summarizes the global and regional climate of the preceding calendar year and places it into a historical context. In addition, notable climatic anomalies and events are discussed.

Major findings in the 2010 report were:
* 2010 was one of the two warmest years of the [[instrumental temperature record]]
* The [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] transitioned from [[El Niño]] to [[La Niña]]
* Changes in the [[Arctic]] and [[Greenland]] continued to outpace those across the rest of the planet, on average

The 2010 issue included a sidebar detailing the multiple lines of evidence (major variables besides global temperature) consistent with the conclusion of a warming planet. An image associated with this sidebar has been recreated many times since, as the 11 (or ten) indicators of a warming planet.

== State of the Climate in 2011 ==
The 2011 edition contained submissions from 376 authors from 46 nations/territories. The La Nina event of that year was a major focus of the report. The cover featured East African women walking to retrieve water in a dust storm. East African drought is not atypical of La Nina episodes.

'''''Stingray''''' is a British children's [[Supermarionation]] television series, created by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]] and produced by [[AP Films]] for [[Associated Television]] and [[ITC Entertainment]] between 1964 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/5364/stingray-the-complete-series/ |title=Stingray: The Complete Series : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its 39 half-hour episodes were originally broadcast on ITV in the United Kingdom and in [[Television syndication|syndication]] in the United States and Canada.

The series was written by the Andersons, [[Alan Fennell]] and [[Dennis Spooner]]. Its music was composed by [[Barry Gray]] and its [[special effects]] were directed by [[Derek Meddings]]. It was filmed in [[Eastmancolor]] at a cost of approximately £1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="O'Brien80"&gt;O'Brien, p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stingray'' was the first Supermarionation series to feature marionette characters with interchangeable heads that enabled them to show a variety of expressions. It was also the first British TV series to be filmed entirely in colour,&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,80"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;96.&lt;/ref&gt; primarily to increase its appeal to the lucrative American market.&lt;ref name="Rogers68"&gt;Rogers et al., p.&amp;nbsp;68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peel240"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SangsterCondon"/&gt;

==Premise==
''Stingray'', a [[Nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered]] combat [[submarine]] built for speed and manoeuvrability, is the [[flagship]] of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), a branch of the World Security Patrol (WSP) responsible for policing the Earth's oceans in the mid-[[2060s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/anderson/stingray/intro.shtml |title=BBC Online - Cult - Gerry Anderson - Stingray -Introduction |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Sources give the year as 2064 (Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;88; Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;12) or 2065 (Sellers, p.&amp;nbsp;88). The episode "The Lighthouse Dwellers" is set in 2065 (La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;103). The episode "Eastern Eclipse" is set 12 months after "Star of the East" (Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;92).&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel is armed with "sting missile" [[torpedo]]es and can travel at up to {{Convert|600|kn|km/h}} underwater, while its pressure compensators allow it to reach depths of over {{Convert|36000|ft|km}}.

The WASP's base is Marineville, located several miles inland somewhere on the [[West Coast of North America]]. It is connected to the [[Pacific Ocean]] via a tunnel leading to an "ocean door", through which ''Stingray'' is launched. Alerts such as "[[action stations]]", "launch stations", and "battle stations" are sounded by rapid drum beats that are played over the base's [[public address]] system. In emergency situations, the entire base is lowered into underground bunkers on giant hydraulic jacks while interceptor missiles and [[fighter aircraft]] are launched to counter threats. WASP personnel acknowledge commands with the phrase "P.W.O.R." – short for "Proceeding With Orders Received".

''Stingray'' is piloted by the square-jawed Captain Troy Tempest. He is paired with [[American South|Southern]] navigator Lieutenant George Lee Sheridan, nicknamed "Phones" for his role as ''Stingray''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[hydrophone]] operator. Troy and Phones board ''Stingray'' by sitting on twin injector seats in Marineville's stand-by lounge, which are lowered into the vessel via injector tubes and then clamped into place. They answer to the crusty "[[Wheelchair|hoverchair]]"-bound Commander Sam Shore, whose daughter, Lieutenant Atlanta Shore, takes shifts in the Marineville control tower and is enamoured of Troy.

At the start of the series, the WASP learns that the ocean floor is home to many underwater civilisations. Among these is the city of Titanica – whose tyrannical ruler, King Titan, commands a brutal warrior race called the Aquaphibians and possesses a fleet of lethal submersibles known as "Mechanical Fish" (referred to as "Terror Fish" in [[tie-in]] media).&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,355"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;355.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first episode, ''Stingray'' is attacked by Titan's forces and Troy and Phones are captured. They are rescued by Titan's slave, Marina, a [[Muteness|mute]] young woman from the undersea city of Pacifica who can breathe underwater. Marina returns to Marineville with Troy and Phones and becomes a regular member of the ''Stingray'' crew. Troy becomes infatuated with her, making Atlanta jealous. Meanwhile, Titan, furious at Marina's betrayal, vows revenge on "terraineans" (land people) in general and Troy and the WASP in particular.

Many later episodes revolve around Titan's schemes to destroy ''Stingray'' and Marineville; however, these usually fail due to the incompetence of his spy on land, Surface Agent X-2-0. Based on the Pacific island of Lemoy, X-2-0 lives in a dilapidated house whose walls conceal banks of highly-sophisticated surveillance and tracking equipment. Other episodes feature encounters with other races living under the sea or within the Earth, some friendly and others hostile, or investigation of natural phenomena.

;Compilation films

Between 1980 and 1981, two [[compilation film]]s were produced. Each of these comprised re-edited versions of four of the original episodes. The films were produced for the American market and aired in the United States as part of an [[ITC Entertainment]] package titled "Super Space Theater"; other Supermarionation series were given similar treatments. On 24 November ([[Thanksgiving]]) 1988, the second ''Stingray'' compilation feature, ''Invaders from the Deep'', appeared as the first broadcast episode of movie-mocking TV series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' in the US.

==Characters==
===WASP personnel===
* '''Captain Troy Tempest''': Captain of the WASP's main submarine, Stingray (voiced by [[Don Mason (actor)|Don Mason]]). He was made Aquanaut of the Year in one episode, for his fearlessness and bravery.
* '''Lieutenant George Lee "Phones" Sheridan''': Stingray's co-pilot hydrophone operator (voiced by [[Robert Easton (actor)|Robert Easton]]) He is Troy's loyal best friend. (Phones' real name, George Sheridan, is referred to in the series' publicity material but is not mentioned on-screen.)
* '''Marina''': - A mute mermaid (though in one episode is voiced by [[Sylvia Anderson]]), who once was the slave for Titan and princess of the undersea race of friendly Pacificans.  In the first episode she helped Troy and Phones escape from Titan.
* '''Commander Samuel "Sam" Shore''': Commander of the WASP base at Marineville (voiced by [[Ray Barrett]]). He is a widower and confined to a hoverchair. He is also the father of Atlanta Shore. The reason for his disability is revealed in the episode "The Ghost of the Sea": as a security agent for a deep-sea mining platform, he was injured when a hostile submersible attacked the facility and damaged his patrol craft. He managed to ram the enemy in return, and then escape to the surface, but in so doing lost the use of his legs. 
* '''Lieutenant Atlanta Shore''': Control Tower Lieutenant (voiced by [[Lois Maxwell]]). She works with her father, Commander Shore. She is also Troy's love interest.
* '''Sub-Lieutenant John Horatio Fisher''': An eager young Lieutenant (voiced by [[Ray Barrett]]).  He works in the control tower with Commander Shore and Lieutenant Atlanta. In the episode "Rescue from the Skies" he is seen training to be an aquanaut.

===Villains===
* '''King Titan of Titanica''': Ruthless ruler of the undersea race of the Aquaphibians from Titanica (voiced by [[Ray Barrett]]). In the Pilot episode he captures Troy and Phones but they escape thanks to his slave Marina helping them.
* '''Surface Agent X-2-Zero''': Surface agent who lives on the island of Lemoy, near Marineville, and reports directly to Titan (voiced by [[Robert Easton (actor)|Robert Easton]]).  He is often blamed by Titan when things go wrong in Titan's plans.
* '''The Aquaphibians''': Titan's minions. Their voices were supplied by [[Robert Easton (actor)|Robert Easton]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]] aided by a looped tape recording of bubbling water.&lt;ref&gt;Sellers, p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurring characters===
* '''Oink the Seal''': A seal pup (voiced by [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]]).  He joins the Stingray crew as Marina's pet after saving them from a bomb.
* '''Marineville Tracking Station operative''': An early warning system that alerts Marineville of aerial attacks and unidentified vessels and aircraft in the area (voiced in most episodes by David Graham, and 1 episode by [[Lois Maxwell]]).
* '''Marineville Power Plant Technician''': Controls when Marineville goes into Battle Stations Mode (voiced by [[Ray Barrett]]).
* '''Doc''': Marineville's main Doctor (voiced by David Graham).
* '''Admiral Jack Denver''': He is president of the WASP underwater research division (voiced by David Graham). He went to college with Commander Shore and enjoys debating with him.

Marina is unique among [[Supermarionation]] characters in that she has no dialogue. In the episode "Raptures of the Deep" she appears to communicate [[telepathic]]ally with Troy (her thoughts voiced by [[Sylvia Anderson]]), but this is later revealed to be a part of a dream that Troy experienced while delirious, having passed out underwater due to a lack of oxygen. In the [[dream sequence]] in question, Marina's lips do not move because her puppet was not equipped with a speech mechanism.

==Production==
As filming on ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' came to an end in late 1962, producer [[Gerry Anderson]] considered a series set underwater to be the next logical step for [[AP Films]]: "We had been on land and in space, so where could we go next? One possibility was underwater."&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn88"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;88.&lt;/ref&gt; He was inspired by childhood memories of [[U-boat]]s in the [[Second World War]], as well as by the mysteries of the ocean: "I was ... fascinated by trenches in the ocean that are as deep as mountains are high. There are features that man has never seen and pressures that are almost impossible to withstand. I began to wonder if there were areas of the Earth which had been little explored and felt justified in writing some wacky stuff."&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn89"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lew Grade]], who had been financing APF since the production of ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'' and had bought the company following the commercial success of ''Fireball XL5'',&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; approved the new concept and commissioned 26 episodes.&lt;ref name="LaRivière102"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson named the series "Stingray" in part due to a mistaken belief that [[stingray]]s are dangerous animals, but also because it "seemed an exciting title."&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn89"/&gt;

===Filming===
In preparation for the new series, APF moved to larger facilities on a different part of the [[Slough Trading Estate]] at a cost of £75,000&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt; (approximately £{{Inflation|UK|0.075|1963|r=2}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|UK}}). The new studios, built inside a factory unit, were located half a mile from the site where APF had filmed ''[[Four Feather Falls]]'', ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'' and ''Fireball XL5''.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn90"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt; They contained three shooting stages, each measuring {{Convert|40 x 45|ft|m}}:&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn90"/&gt; two for puppet filming and one for [[special effects]] filming.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt;

Production began in the spring of 1963 and the series was completed in ten months, with each episode taking an average of 16.5 days to film.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt; The total cost of the production was approximately £1&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="O'Brien80"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia of Cult Children's TV|last1=Lewis|first1=Richard|year=2002|origyear=2001|publisher=[[Allison &amp; Busby]]|location=London, UK|isbn=9780749005290|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately £{{Inflation|UK|1|1963|r=2}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|UK}}). It was budgeted at £20,000 (approximately £{{Inflation|UK|20000|1963|fmt=c|r=-3}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}) per episode, which enabled APF, whose earlier productions had been in [[black and white]], to film in [[Eastmancolor]].&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The [[opening credits]] refer to the colour process as "Videcolor".&lt;/ref&gt; The switch to colour filming was intended to increase the series' chances of being bought by a network in the United States, where colour TV broadcasts were already common.&lt;ref name="Rogers68"/&gt; Sets were re-painted after [[NBC]] supplied APF with a list of colours believed to cause problems such as flaring or bleeding; according to Anderson, this was unnecessary because if filmed in Eastmancolour, a set "would appear on screen exactly as you had painted it."&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn91"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some colours were avoided as they did not come out well in black and white.&lt;ref&gt;Meddings, pp.&amp;nbsp;33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; During the production of ''Stingray'', APF became the largest consumer of [[colour film]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt;  

As filming progressed, Grade extended his commission to 39 episodes.&lt;ref name="LaRivière102"/&gt; As shooting on the final 13 episodes commenced, [[Don Mason (actor)|Don Mason]] and [[Robert Easton (actor)|Robert Easton]], who had been told that all members of the voice cast were being paid the same amount, discovered that they were actually earning less than their co-star [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]].&lt;ref name="LaRivière102"/&gt; Mason and Easton did not commit to the remaining episodes until their fees had been re-negotiated.&lt;ref name="LaRivière102"/&gt;

In a first for a Supermarionation series, ''Stingray'' features a Christmas-themed episode ("A Christmas to Remember") and a [[clip show]] final episode. The latter, "Aquanaut of the Year", incorporates elements from the documentary series ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', which required APF to obtain the approval of its creator, [[Ralph Edwards]]. With negotiations between Edwards and APF taking longer than expected, work commenced on an alternative series finale in which Commander Shore and Admiral Denver view highlights from a selection of ''Stingray''{{'}}s missions on a film projector; however, the production of this episode was halted when Edwards gave APF permission to proceed with "Aquanaut of the Year".&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn99"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt; The linking material from the abandoned episode was re-discovered in either 2000 or 2001 and subsequently included on ''Stingray'' DVD releases.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn100"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=News: ''Stingray'' and ''Scarlet''|journal=[[TV Zone]]|last1=May|first1=Dominic|issue=138|date=May 2001|publication-date=April 2001|publisher=[[Visual Imagination]]|location=London, UK|issn=0957-3844|oclc=226121852|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later, it was combined with footage from "Stingray", "An Echo of Danger", and "Emergency Marineville" to create a new 29-minute clip show titled "The Reunion Party", which was first broadcast in 2008.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,94"/&gt;

===Characters and puppets===
Gerry Anderson said that the character of Phones was inspired by a sound engineer with whom he used to work: "He spent so long with his headphones plugged in to various bits of equipment that he used to leave them on all the time, earning himself the nickname 'Phones'."&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn89"/&gt; Voice actor Robert Easton based the character's [[Southern American]] tones on his performance in the 1961 film ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'', in which he had played a Southern radio operator called Sparks.&lt;ref name="LaRivière101"/&gt; The voice of Surface Agent X-2-0 was Easton's impression of actor [[Peter Lorre]], who had appeared in the same film.&lt;ref name="LaRivière101"/&gt;

Sylvia Anderson, who had voiced the regular character Dr Venus on ''Fireball XL5'' and was credited for "[[characterisation]] supervision" for ''Stingray'', stated in her 2007 autobiography that she devised Marina as mute because she wanted to take a break from voice acting and "concentrate on the scripts and characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Sylvia|author1-link=Sylvia Anderson|title=Sylvia Anderson: My Fab Years!|year=2007|publisher=[[Hermes Press]]|location=Neshannock, Pennsylvania|isbn = 978-1-932563-91-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aquaphibians were based on a villainous alien from the ''Fireball XL5'' episode "XL5 to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O".&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of designing and making the puppets took four months and each of the main characters was sculpted in duplicate to allow two episodes to be filmed simultaneously using both puppet stages.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn94"/&gt; The likenesses of some of the puppets were inspired by real-life actors: Titan was based on a young [[Laurence Olivier]]&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn94"/&gt; and Surface Agent X-2-0 on either [[Claude Rains]]&lt;ref name="Rogers75"&gt;Rogers et al., p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaRivière98"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;98.&lt;/ref&gt; or Peter Lorre.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn94"/&gt; Troy Tempest was modelled on [[James Garner]] at Gerry Anderson's suggestion.&lt;ref name="SangsterCondon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LaRivière98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sellers, p.&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta Shore has been likened to [[Lois Maxwell]] (who voiced the character)&lt;ref name="SangsterCondon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LaRivière98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt; and Marina to both [[Brigitte Bardot]]&lt;ref name="SangsterCondon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers53"&gt;Rogers et al., p.&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/stingray-the-complete-colletion&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ursula Andress]].&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn94"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sellers, pp.&amp;nbsp;89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stingray'' was the first Supermarionation series to feature puppets with glass eyes and poseable hands (both specially made by outside contractors) for greater realism.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SangsterCondon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LaRivière98"/&gt; To make the puppets' eyes sparkle in a lifelike way, they were polished with [[silicon]] and illuminated using an "eye light" (a small lamp).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Thunderbirds – A Complete Guide to the Classic Series | chapter = Setting the Scene | last1 = Hearn | first1 = Marcus | editor1-last = Hearn | editor1-first = Marcus | publisher = [[Panini UK]] | location = Tunbridge Wells, UK | date = September 2015 | isbn = 978-1-84653-212-2 | page = 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another innovation was the creation of alternative heads to allow puppets to express emotions: in addition to their "normal" heads, which had neutral expressions, the main characters could also be fitted with "smiling" and "frowning" heads.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn94"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;94.&lt;/ref&gt; The wigs of female puppets were made of human hair; for male puppets, [[mohair]] was used as it was softer and easier to style.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn93"/&gt;

===Design and effects===
Most of the series' [[special effects]] shots were filmed on [[high-speed camera]]s with the footage slowed down in [[post-production]] to convey greater weight and scale.&lt;ref name="LaRivière101"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Stingray'' submarine was designed by [[Reg Hill]] and built by [[Feltham]]-based company Mastermodels.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LaRivière101"/&gt; The Marineville model, which was created in-house, was made of wood and cardboard augmented with pieces of model kits purchased from a toy shop.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn93"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt; It was lowered and raised by [[hydraulics]].&lt;ref name="LaRivière101"/&gt;

The series' underwater scenes were filmed not in a water tank, as Anderson had originally envisaged,&lt;ref name="O'Brien80"/&gt; but by shooting a model of the ocean floor, mounted against a [[Cyclorama (theater)|cyclorama]],&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn91"/&gt; through a thin [[aquarium]] and "flying" the puppets and miniature models across the set on wires from an overhead gantry.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt; A similar technique had been used for the underwater scenes in ''Supercar''.&lt;ref&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt; Several aquaria were used; constructed by a company that supplied fish tanks to [[London Zoo]], they were re-built with thicker glass after one of them burst due to the water pressure.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn92"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt; Wires were painted over to make them non-reflective,&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn92"/&gt; while [[vegetable dye]] was added to the aquaria to give the water a murky appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Sellers, p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Fans were used to simulate currents passing over characters' hair and clothing.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn93"/&gt;

The illusion of scenes being set underwater was enhanced by populating the aquaria with [[tropical fish]] of various sizes to create [[forced perspective]].&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers83"&gt;Rogers et al., p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fish food]] was dropped at various points around the aquaria to keep the animals in shot.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn92"/&gt; A disc with various portions cut out was mounted in front of a lamp and rotated to simulate light being [[refracted]] through the ocean surface, while the water inside the aquaria was disturbed to create "ripple" effects.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn91"/&gt; For the conclusion of the ''Stingray'' launch sequence, in which the submarine shoots out of an underwater tunnel, part of the set was painted onto the aquarium to conceal the [[air line]] that was used to produce the accompanying bubbles.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meddings33"&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; The move away from black-and-white filming was sometimes problematic as build-ups of algae caused the water in the aquaria to change colour.&lt;ref name="Meddings33"/&gt;

Water surface shots in ''Supercar'' and ''Fireball XL5'' had been filmed in a single outdoor water tank, but for ''Stingray'' a number of tanks were built inside the studio.&lt;ref name="Meddings32"&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt; As the crew were unable to use lighting effects to make the water look blue, it was dyed to give it a realistic colour.&lt;ref name="Meddings34"&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt; Various powders were added to create [[whitewater]] and foam effects for undersea explosions and storm scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; Miniature models were controlled using wires, poles and underwater tracks and rigs.&lt;ref name="Meddings32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meddings34"/&gt;

Each tank incorporated a [[weir]] system whereby one or more walls, including the back wall, were built lower and the tank was filled to a higher level to create waterfalls.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hearn38"&gt;Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt; With the camera mounted at water level, this produced an artificial horizon at the back of the tank.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt; The overflowing water was collected in troughs and then pumped back into the tank to keep the water level constant and sustain the effect.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008,79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers84"&gt;Rogers et al., p.&amp;nbsp;84.&lt;/ref&gt; To conserve studio space, some scenes were filmed in a wedge-shaped tank that was built to match the [[field of view]] of the camera.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers et al., pp.&amp;nbsp;84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the effects shots in the opening titles, featuring a complex manoeuvre in which ''Stingray'' and a pursuing Mechanical Fish leaping out of the sea, was filmed in a single take.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn92"/&gt;

Shots of aircraft in flight were filmed using a technique known as the "rolling sky", whereby the miniature model remained stationary and an illusion of movement was created by continuously running a loop of painted canvas background around two electrically-driven rollers. This system, devised by effects director [[Derek Meddings]], made aerial shots easier to film as it took up little studio space.&lt;ref&gt;Meddings, pp.&amp;nbsp;36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening and closing titles===
The [[title sequence]] consists of a series of action shots featuring undersea explosions, Marineville going to red alert and ''Stingray'' being launched to do battle with a Mechanical Fish. This is accompanied by dramatic narration from the character of Commander Shore, who warns the audience to "Stand by for action!" and declares that "Anything can happen in the next half-hour!" In the first 26 episodes, the title sequence opens in black and white before switching to colour; for the final 13 episodes, the first few seconds were replaced with all-colour footage.&lt;ref name="LaRivière103"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;103.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, authors of ''Collins Telly Guide'', praise the opening titles, writing that "Of all the programmes we've looked at for this book, there is none with a title sequence as thrilling as ''Stingray''."&lt;ref name="SangsterCondon"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collins Telly Guide|last1=Sangster|first1=Jim|last2=Condon|first2=Paul|year=2005|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-00-719099-7|page=722}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]], the ''Stingray'' title sequence contrasts greatly with those of ''Supercar'' and ''Fireball XL5'', which he describes as "straight narrative openings".&lt;ref name="Peel241"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt; Peel also argues that ''Stingray'' has influenced the "rapid cutting, pounding rhythms and extreme stylising" of subsequent TV title sequences.&lt;ref name="Peel241"/&gt; 

The series' [[closing titles]] focus on the [[love triangle]] between Atlanta, Troy, and Marina, with Troy singing "Aqua Marina" – a song about his romantic feelings for Marina, performed by [[Gary Miller (singer)|Gary Miller]] with backing vocals by [[soprano]] Joan Brown – while Atlanta gazes wistfully at his photograph.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn98"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
In the UK, ''Stingray'' was first broadcast on 4 October 1964 in the [[ITV Anglia|Anglia]], [[ITV Border|Border]], [[Grampian Television|Grampian]], [[ITV London|London]] and [[Southern Television|Southern]] regions.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn100"/&gt; Although it received little publicity it replicated the success of earlier Supermarionation series.&lt;ref name="LaRivière102"/&gt; Having debuted in black and white, it was transmitted in colour for the first time in December 1969.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn91"/&gt; It was repeated on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1981&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2017,p.&amp;nbsp;188.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BBC2]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2017,p.&amp;nbsp;194.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also shown on [[Sky One]] from 2002 to 2003. 

In the US, the series was first broadcast in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Stempel, p.&amp;nbsp;174.&lt;/ref&gt; Premiering in colour, it was [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] across more than 100 markets with total sales exceeding £3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="ArcherHearn91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers et al., p.&amp;nbsp;94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] aired the series between 1992 and 1997 as part of its "[[Cartoon Quest|Sci-Fi Cartoon Quest]]" programming block.

==Tie-ins==
''Stingray'' was featured in the Supermarionation [[tie-in]] comic ''[[TV Century 21]]'' from its first issue, published by [[Century 21 Merchandising|AP Films (Merchandising)]] in January 1965.&lt;ref name="LaRivière102"/&gt; The 1960s also saw the publication of two original novels by [[Armada Books]]: ''Stingray'' and ''Stingray and the Monster'', written by John William Jennison under the pseudonym "John Theydon".&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the revival of the show on [[BBC2]], a self-titled ''Stingray'' comic was launched in 1993 and ran until 1995, published by [[Fleetway Publications]]. The strips featured were direct reprints from ''TV Century 21'' with minimal new content such as competitions and letter pages. In 1995 the comic was cancelled and the remaining ''Stingray'' strips were featured in the then ongoing ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' comic until it's eventual cancellation. 

;Audio episodes
To supplement the 39 TV episodes, in 1965 AP Films (Merchandising) released three "audio adventures" as [[7-inch]] vinyl [[EP record]]s (marketed as "mini-albums").&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;367.&lt;/ref&gt; These audio episodes, each running to approximately 21 minutes and featuring the voice cast from the TV series, are included as special features on the UK ''Stingray'' DVD [[box set]].

"Marina Speaks" reveals that Marina is in fact not mute at all. In fact, her race has been cursed by Titan – should any one of them speak, another will die.&lt;ref name="SangsterCondon"/&gt; They are not certain that this is true, but none of them dares find out; thus, for years they have lived in complicit silence.

==Reception==
Media historian Marcus Hearn argues that ''Stingray'' essentially "[transfers] the format of ''Fireball XL5'' to an underwater setting."&lt;ref name="Hearn38"/&gt; Writing in 2006, [[Robert Sellers]] described ''Stingray'' as the "first truly classic Anderson show", whose special effects "have stood the test of time remarkably well."&lt;ref&gt;Sellers, p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel O'Brien, author of ''SF:UK: How British Science Fiction Changed the World'', considers it to be "perhaps the archetypal Gerry Anderson series".&lt;ref name="O'Brien81"&gt;O'Brien, p.&amp;nbsp;81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the DVD box set in 2001, Mike Fillis of ''[[TV Zone]]'' magazine conceded that ''Stingray'' was less "ambitious" than its immediate follow-up, ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', but compared its "self-awareness" and "looseness" favourably to the "po-faced rigidity" of ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]''. He also praised the series' "well-drawn" characters and described its water-based special effects sequences as "surprisingly elegant" given the "uncooperative" nature of the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Reviews: Merchandise: ''Stingray''|journal=TV Zone|last1=Fillis|first1=Mike|issue=138|date=May 2001|publication-date=April 2001|publisher=Visual Imagination|location=London, UK|issn=0957-3844|oclc=226121852|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Cornell]], [[Martin Day]] and [[Keith Topping]], authors of ''The Guinness Book of Classic British TV'', view ''Stingray''{{'}}s effects as more "realistic" than those of earlier Supermarionation productions. They also argue that while many episodes were "predictable and corny", the series contained a "knowingness and a love of character that made the whole thing charming."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Cornell|first1=Paul|last2=Day|first2=Martin|last3=Topping|first3=Keith|author1-link=Paul Cornell|author2-link=Martin Day|author3-link=Keith Topping|title=The Guinness Book of Classic British TV|editor1-last=Marshall|editor1-first=Anne|year=1996|origyear=1993|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-85112-628-9|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jon E. Lewis and Penny Stempel, authors of ''Cult TV: The Essential Critical Guide'', the series featured "plenty of kiddie-time exciting narrative action, while the more sophisticated could enjoy its proclivity to spoof virtually everything which passed its periscope."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Stempel, p.&amp;nbsp;175.&lt;/ref&gt; Sangster and Condon argue that while elements such as the animal character, Oink, mean that ''Stingray'' is aimed primarily at children, it is the first Anderson series in which the "sophistication of the production" creates appeal for adults. They regard ''Stingray'' as "much less po-faced" than ''Thunderbirds'', with episodes that are "mercifully shorter, leading to tighter plotting and an engaging simplicity".&lt;ref name="SangsterCondon"/&gt; Peel suggests that the "[[tongue-in-cheek]] humour that [Gerry] Anderson favoured probably reached its peak with ''Stingray''."&lt;ref&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media historian [[Nicholas J. Cull]] observes that through its depiction of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), ''Stingray'' is one of several Gerry Anderson series to "assume the development of [[world government]] and world security institutions" and "reflect the 1960s vogue for stories set in secret organisations with extravagant acronyms." He compares the premise to the [[Cold War]], noting the conflict between WASP and the various undersea races and the latter's use of spies to infiltrate human society. Cull cites "Marineville Traitor", whose plot concerns the hunt for an "enemy within", as an episode with an "especially strong Cold War flavour". He also notes that while Anderson's series often focus on the dangers of [[nuclear technology]], ''Stingray'' also presents it in a positive light: ''Stingray'' itself, for example, is a [[nuclear-powered submarine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cull | first1 = Nicholas J. | author1-link = Nicholas J.

Sarah Kurchak of [[The A.V. Club]] argues that compared to villains in previous Anderson series Titan and the Aquaphibians represent a "more classically Cold War-style villainous [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]". She adds: "Throughout the 39 episodes, the battle lines between land and sea are clearly defined, the enemy is always watching, and the target of their aggression is always close to home." Kurchak also suggests that the character of Troy Tempest serves as an embodiment of Cold War anxieties through his "multiple nightmares" involving threats against Marineville.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/puppet-state-the-growing-cold-war-anxiety-of-gerry-and-1798246195|title=Puppet State: The Growing Cold War Anxiety of Gerry Anderson's Supermarionation Shows|last1=Kurchak|first1=Sarah|date=1 April 2016|work=[[The A.V.

==''Stingray''-class==
According to the ''Stingray'' comic strip in the weekly ''[[Countdown (Polystyle Publications)|Countdown]]'' comic, more than one ''Stingray''-class submarine was in service in the Marineville fleet. These vessels had names such as ''Spearfish'', ''Barracuda'', ''Moray'', and ''Thornback'' and were identified by different numbers on their fins, suggesting that the "3" painted on ''Stingray''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s tail fin did not indicate that the submarine was a "Mark III" after all.

A similar idea had been adopted by author [[John Theydon]] for his second ''Stingray'' tie-in novel, ''Stingray and the Monster'', some years prior. In the novel, another WASP submarine (unnamed and referred to as "Number Thirteen") is hi-jacked by an old enemy of Commander Shore. Theydon's description of the hi-jacked boat, both inside and out, is recognisably similar to that of ''Stingray'', with the exception that "Number Thirteen" is stated not to possess ''Stingray''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s exceptional performance, being limited to roughly {{convert|400|kn|km/h}} instead of the {{convert|600|kn|km/h}} that ''Stingray'' is quoted as being able to attain. The implication, not explicitly stated, is that ''Stingray'' is an upgraded version of the design. Later, ''[[TV Century 21|TV21]]'' comic mentioned a second "super-sub" due to enter service under the WASP that is stolen by a [[Mysteron]] agent as part of the plot of a ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' story.

[[File:The Birds of the Malay Peninsula.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''''The Birds of the Malay Peninsula''''' is a major illustrated ornithological reference work conceived and started by [[Herbert Christopher Robinson]].  The full title is '''''The Birds of the Malay Peninsula: a general account of the birds inhabiting the region from the isthmus of Kra to Singapore with the adjacent islands'''''.  It comprises five substantial ([[octavo (book)|large octavo]]) hardbound volumes of text, with 125 plates (123 in colour) by [[Henrik Grönvold]] and 11 maps.  It was published by H. F. and G. Witherby, London.  The binding of the first four volumes was red [[buckram]]; the fifth was red cloth with a dust jacket.

==History==
Robinson served as Director of Museums in the [[Federated Malay States]] in the early 20th century.  On his retirement in 1926 he initiated the production of the work, though he died in 1929 after the first two volumes were published.  With the help of Robinson's notes and papers, the third and fourth volumes were prepared by [[Frederick Nutter Chasen|Frederick Chasen]], the Director of the [[Raffles Museum]] in [[Singapore]].  Completion was much delayed, first by Robinson's death, and then by Chasen's early in 1942.  The fifth and final volume, by Lord Medway and David Wells, was eventually published in 1976, in a review of which D.G. Robertson says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"After the war [[Edward Banks (naturalist)|E. Banks]], former Curator of the [[Sarawak Museum]], wrote a replacement text and deposited it in the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum (Natural History)]]. In 1964, Ken Scriven, a long-time resident of Malaysia, was in London and quite by chance discovered not only Banks's text but also the coloured plates by H. Gronvold. He informed [[Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 5th Earl of Cranbrook|Lord Medway]] and David Wells who in turn decided to complete the series. Witherby, publisher of Volumes I to IV, agreed to produce Volume V using typesetting, paper and layout identical with the previous volumes and in 1976 the task was completed, almost fifty years after its inception.  The authors have revised and updated Banks's text and, because Volumes I to IV are almost priceless, have amended Chasen's original intentions so that Volume V can stand on its own."

'''Water-in-water''' (W/W) [[emulsion]] is a system that consists of droplets of water-solvated molecules in another continuous aqueous solution; both the droplet and continuous phases contain different molecules that are entirely water-soluble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=B. T. Nguyen|author2=T. Nicolai|author3=L. Benyahia|last-author-amp=yes|title=Stabilization of Water-in-Water Emulsions by Addition of Protein Particles|journal=Langmuir|date=2013|volume=23|issue=3|pages=1453–1458 |doi=10.1021/la402131e|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/la402131e}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, when two entirely aqueous solutions containing different water-soluble molecules are mixed, water droplets containing predominantly one component are dispersed in water solution containing another component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=I.

A. Simon|author2=P. Sejwal|author3=R. B. Gerecht|author4=Y.-Y. Luk|last-author-amp=yes|title=Water-in-Water Emulsions Stabilized by Non-Amphiphilic Interactions: Polymer-Dispersed Lyotropic Liquid Crystals.|journal=Langmuir|date=2007|volume=40|issue=5|pages=441–456|doi=10.1021/la062203s|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la062203s}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These molecular interactions include [[hydrogen bonding]], [[pi stacking]], and [[Salt bridge|salt bridging]]. This w/w emulsion was generated when the different water-solvated molecular functional groups get segregated in an aqueous mixture consisting of [[polymer]] and [[liquid crystal]] molecules. 
[[Image:Disodium cromolyn glycate.png|150px|thumb|right|Structure of disodium cromolyn glycate, DSCG]]
This water-in-water emulsion consists of liquid crystals suspended as water-solvated droplets dispersed in a solution of polymer whose solvent is also water.  The liquid crystal component of the emulsion is disodium cromolyn glycate (DSCG). This molecule is an anti-asthmatic drug, but also exists as a special type of liquid crystal when the concentration of DSCG is ~9-21 wt%.  Unlike conventional lyotropic liquid crystals which consist of oily molecules such as [[5CB]], DSCG molecules are not amphiphilic, but entirely water-soluble. Thus, the separation of [[hydrophobic]]/[[hydrophilic]] groups cannot be applied to DSCG. The polymer solution serves as the medium or continuous phase of the w/w emulsion.  Apart from being water-soluble, one important criterium for the generation of this w/w emulsion system is that the polymer cannot bear functional groups that interact strongly with DSCG. As such, ionic polymer when mixed with DSCG does not form w/w emulsion, but gives rise to a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] solution or a precipitate solution. Consequently, the known polymers that afford w/w emulsion include polyacrylic amides and [[polyols]]. Surprisingly, some of these water-in-water emulsions can be exceptionally stable from coalescence for up to 30 days.  
Because molecules of liquid crystal assume a preferred common orientation among themselves, the overall orientation of liquid crystals in a droplet is only stable in certain configurations (Fig. 3). As water solvated droplets in a w/w emulsion, DSCG molecules would align in a preferred direction on the surface of the droplet.  To minimize the overall energy of the system, the DSCG molecules in the droplet prefer to align either parallel or perpendicular to the surfaces of the droplets.(Fig. 4A,B).
[[Image:Ww1c.png|500px|right]]
The stability of this water-in-water emulsion from coalescence is attributed to three molecular forces:
 
1. The separation of different molecular forces at the beginning of the droplet formation. Similar forces tend to stay together: pi-stacking and salt bridging are the two dominant forces in the liquid crystal droplet phase, while hydrogen bonding governs in the continuous polymer phase.  
[[Image:Wwf4a.png|500px|right]]

[[Image:Wwf4b.png|500px|right]]
2. As the droplet size increases, the molecular interactions at the interface of the droplet phase and the continuous phase become stronger through [[multivalent (chemistry)|multivalent]] interactions. The strengthening of interfacial molecular interactions in w/w emulsions results in the formation of a layer of polymer that coats the surface of the droplet which consequently prevents droplets from clumping together.
 
3. In addition, it is also proposed that when two liquid crystal droplets merge (coalescence), the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules in the two merging droplets must change to “adapt” to each other, and thus incur an energy penalty which prevent the occurrence of coalescence.

This w/w emulsion also represents a new class of polymer dispersed liquid crystals(PDLC). Traditionally known PDLC consists of oil-in-water emulsion where the oily droplet is a thermotropic liquid crystal such as 4-pentyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (5CB), and the water phase contains certain polymers. In comparison, this water-in-water emulsion consists of Polymer-Dispersed [[Lyotropic]] Liquid Crystals, where the lyotropic liquid crystal is DSCG molecules solvated in water.  Traditional PDLCs have found application, from switchable windows to projection displays. The water-in-water emulsion of polymer-dispersed lyotropic liquid crystals has the potential for building highly bio-functional materials because of its compatibility with protein structure.

Other known types of water-in-water emulsions involve the separation of different biopolymers in aqueous solution.
