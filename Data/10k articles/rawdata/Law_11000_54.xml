{{double image|right|Jules Favre.jpg|195|Otto von Bismarck - gravure.jpg|174|[[Jules Favre]]|[[Otto von Bismarck]]}}
The '''Armistice of Versailles''' that came into effect on 28 January 1871 brought to an end the active phase of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The signatories were [[Jules Favre]], foreign minister in the provisional [[Government of National Defence]], for the French and [[Otto von Bismarck]], chancellor of the newly established [[German Empire]], for [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and her allies. The suspension of hostilities initially lasted until 19 February, when it was extended through 26 February, when [[Treaty of Versailles (1871)|a preliminary peace treaty]] was signed, also at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. The definitive [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] was signed on 10 May. Although technically an armistice, the military position of France at the time and the terms were such that it was ''de facto'' a conditional surrender by the vanquished to the victors.

==First attempt==
On the morning of 2 September, with the [[battle of Sedan]] raging about him, [[Napoleon III]], Emperor of the French, ordered a [[white flag]] hoisted above the [[Château de Sedan|fortress of Sedan]]. The emperor then order the commander of the [[XII Corps (France)|XII Corps]], General [[Barthélémy Lebrun]], to send a negotiator (''parlementaire'') to the Prussians with a request for an armistice. The chief of staff of the [[Army of Châlons]] refused to sign any such agreement on behalf of the nominal, but wounded commander, [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon]], and General [[Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot]] disclaimed any authority to do so because he had already been countermanded once by his superior, General [[Emmanuel de Wimpffen]]. Nevertheless, Lebrun and a [[non-commissioned officer]] with a white pennant crossed the lines to seek an armistice "equally acceptable to both armies", bearing a formal letter to that effect. Wimpffen, who would have signed the local armistice, only learned of the effort when he saw the white flag moving along the road. He refused to allow it.{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=218}}

When the Prussian commander, [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]], saw the white flag, he sent [[Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf]] to find out what it meant. Napoleon sent him back with one of his own officers, General [[André-Charles-Victor Reille|A.-C.-V. Reille]], who carried a letter offering to surrender. After reading it, von Moltke sent Reille back with a letter of acceptance. Wimpffen was ordered to arrange the surrender.{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=219}} This day, ''[[Sedantag]]'' in German (French ''journée de Sedan''), became a holiday in the German Empire. The first, brief attempt to avoid disaster through an armistice had failed and the emperor had become a [[prisoner of war]].

==First negotiations==
Favre, a staunch republican, was appointed vice president and minister of foreign affairs in the provisional government declared on 4 September 1870, after the capture of the Emperor [[Napoleon III]]. Like President [[Louis Jules Trochu]], Favre did not believe France held a realistic chance of winning the war or even of defending Paris. Soon after the formation of the new government, Favre proposed to the cabinet that Germany be offered an indemnity in return for evacuating French territory.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=21}} This was rejected, and Favre opened a channel of communications with Bismarck through the British ambassador in Paris, [[Lord Lyons]]. Bismarck questioned the legitimacy of the French government. On 17 September, Favre left Paris for the Prussian military headquarters to confer with Bismarck about an armistice. Only President Trochu and Minister of War [[Adolphe LeFlô]] of all the members of the government had knowledge of his plan.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=22}}

Favre crossed the German lines with a [[flag of truce]] and met Bismarck at [[Montry]]. From there they proceeded to the headquarters at [[Château de Ferrières]], where two full days were exhausted in discussion, but no armistice was arranged before Favre returned to Paris on 19 September. Favre offered an indemnity of 500,000,000 [[francs]], but refused Bismarck's request for territorial concessions.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=22}} Favre's early public pronouncement that "We will not surrender an inch of our territory, nor a stone of our fortresses!" had become a slogan in Paris and was posted all over the city in September–October 1870.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=21 n. 9}}

Favre argued that an armistice would allow the French to hold elections to an assembly that would have political legitimacy. Bismarck agreed, but refused to sign an armistice for such elections unless certain Parisian forts were surrendered in compensation for the advantage France would gain in time.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=22}}  Finally, Favre offered to surrender [[Strasbourg]] if its defenders received the honours of war. Bismarck demanded they become prisoners of war and discussion broke off. Before leaving Bismarck, Favre wept. On 20 September Favre reported his results to the cabinet, and Bismarck's terms were rejected completely.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=23}} On 24 September the government indefinitely postponed local and national elections. In the words of [[Léon Gambetta]], "We could not have elections without an armistice, and the effect of an armistice would be to relax the efforts of the defence."{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=239}}

On 1 October two neutral American officers, General [[Ambrose Burnside]] and Colonel Paul Forbes, were granted permission by the Germans to visit Paris as observers. When they returned they reported to the Germans the French conditions for an armistice: that it last two weeks, that elections be held, that Paris be revictualled and that no territory be ceded—although Favre had apparently come to accept the loss of [[Alsace]]. The American effort had no effect but to clarify to each side what was unacceptable to the other: the revictualling of Paris to the Germans and territorial concessions to the French.{{sfn|Howard|1961|pp=330–31}}

==Second negotiations==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R09517, Deutsch-französischer Krieg, Hauptquartier Versailles.jpg|thumb|German headquarters at Versailles during the Franco-Prussian War]]
After the failure of the first effort at an armistice, the Government of National Defence sent [[Louis Adolphe Thiers]] on a diplomatic mission to the capitals of neutral Europe. At London [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]] offered to help negotiate an armistice, which offer was never taken up.{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=336}} When Thiers was granted a [[safe conduct]] through the German [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|siege lines around Paris]], he briefly met Bismarck, only to tell him that he was unauthorised to speak to the enemy. Bismarck told him that [[Siege of Metz (1870)|Metz had surrendered]]. When Thiers reported the results of his mission to the cabinet that evening, they agreed that an armistice was needed. Thiers volunteered to negotiate it, and was duly deputised. He was given two conditions that any armistice should meet: it should allow for free elections (including in France's occupied territories) to be held and it should allow the provisioning of Paris.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|pp=24–25}} On the morning of 31 October, the ''Journal officiel'' carried the first public notice that an armistice may be sought.{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=337}}

Thiers arrived at Versailles on 31 October and negotiations began the next day (1 November). Thiers initially asked for a 28-day armistice with provisioning of Paris and all besieged cities. Bismarck refused and countered by asking for one of the Parisian forts to balance the military advantages France would accrue from a ceasefire. Thiers rejected the surrender of any fortress.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=26}} He later claimed that Bismarck had been amenable to French demands until news of [[Paris uprising of 31 October 1871|the popular uprising in Paris]] had reached him. This uprising—accompanied by shouts of ''Pas d'armistice!'' (No armistice!){{sfn|Howard|1961|p=337}}—had been a response to rumours of Thiers's negotiations. According to Thiers it caused Bismarck to increase his demands, but Lord Lyons believed that the chancellor was merely looking for an excuse to break off talks.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=26 n. 29}}

Having failed to reach an agreement on armistice terms, Thiers tried to uncover the Germans' intentions for the peace treaty. Bismarck threatened that the terms for peace would get harsher the longer the war lasted. As of 5 November, he was demanding Alsace with Strasbourg, part of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] not including Metz and an indemnity of 4,000,000,000 francs.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=27}} On that date, on the [[Pont de Sèvres]], between the German and French lines, Thiers met Favre and counselled acceptance of Bismarck's terms. He offered to take "the responsibility and odium of signing a treaty", according to a letter of Lord Lyons, but Favre would not agree.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=27 n. 33}} On 6 November Thiers was back at Versailles when Favre ordered him to break off negotiations and go to [[Tours, France|Tours]]. He was escorted to the French lines by German soldiers and from there took a train to Tours. He arrived sitting atop a heap of coal.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=28}}

==Third negotiations==
There was no effort to end the war by diplomatic means between 6 November 1870 and 23 January 1871. During that period Favre and [[Ernest Picard]] were the only voices in the government advocating a capitulation or a ''sortie torrentielle'', a major military undertaking. By 27 December, when [[howitzers]] had begun to strike the Parisian fortresses, the city was facing famine and loss of morale. On 5 January the residential areas of the city fell under bombardment.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=29}} The last gasp of French military resistance came at the [[Battle of Buzenval (1871)|battle of Buzenval]] on 19 January. They were defeated. On 20 January Trochu asked for a local armistice to bury the dead, but Bismarck refused.{{sfn|Howard|1961|pp=438–39}} The French president resigned, and on 22 January when a council of war proposed a second mass sortie, there was no officer willing to lead it.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=29}}

On 23 January, Favre was empowered by the cabinet to seek a general armistice, as opposed to the armistice limited to Paris that Trochu favoured. Such a local ceasefire, Favre argued, would only give the Germans the freedom to concentrate their military power on the provincial armies.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=30 n. 46}} Favre was not empowered to negotiate a treaty, since that was supposed to only follow elections to a national assembly. He was to permit the disarming of regular soldiers, but not of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], whose disarming was either feared lest it result in a popular uprising or promoted lest the Guard initiate an uprising. He was not to concede the Germans entry into Paris. He arrived at Versailles under a safe conduct later that evening.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=30}}

Favre admitted to the Germans that Paris was starving, and at Bismarck's request he wrote down an outline of an armistice, including in it the cession of one of the Parisian forts, which would effectively end the siege of Paris in Germany's favour. Bismarck agreed not to enter Paris and to allow the defenders to remain in the city; he would permit a free election and allow the Guard and one regular division to remain armed. The disarming of the rest made it impossible later on for the government to suppress the [[Paris Commune (1871)|Paris Commune]], whose uprising was possible because the Guard retained its arms.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|pp=31–32}}

On 24 January Bismarck agreed to abandon his other negotiations—with the exiled Empress [[Eugénie de Montijo|Eugénie]] and her representative, [[Clément Duvernois]]—and on 25 January the government authorised Favre to sign an armistice for three weeks.{{sfn|Howard|1961|pp=440}} On 26 January Bismarck graciously offered to cease the bombardment of Paris and Favre accepted. A general Parisian ceasefire was agreed for midnight (27 January) and commanders on both sides were given advanced notice. "A few stray shots were fired after the deadline",{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=33}} the armistice was ''de facto'' in effect from that moment. The oral accord in effect from this time mandated that:
*Hostilities were to cease on land and at sea.
*The Parisian forts were to be surrendered.
*An elected assembly was to vote on whether to end the war or continue it before the expiration of the armistice.
*An indemnity of 200,000,000 francs was levied on France.
These terms were to be in effect until 19 February. Owing to a lack of information about operations in the departments of [[Jura (department)|Jura]], [[Doubs]] and [[Côte-d'Or]], these areas were exempted from the general armistice terms in order to preserve the [[fortified region of Belfort]], then [[Siege of Belfort|under siege]].{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=34}} The primary source for the extent of the agreement reached on the date of the ceasefire is the diary of the future German emperor [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]], based on his contacts with Bismarck.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=34 n. 58}}

==Fourth and final negotiations==
[[File:Le Gouvernement de la défense nationale.jpg|thumb|right|The Government of National Defence]]
In Paris Favre requested an officer to help him negotiate the technical articles of the formal armistice. He and General [[Charles-Marie-Napoléon de Beaufort d'Hautpoul|Charles de Beaufort d'Hautpoul]] returned to Versailles on 27 January, but, according to German accounts, the latter got drunk at the dinner celebration and Favre had to get a postponement of the final negotiations to the next day (28 January). On this second try a more competent officer, [[Charles-Auguste-Mathias Horix de Valdan|Charles Horix de Valdan]], chief of staff to the commander of Paris, [[Joseph Vinoy]], was sent along.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=33}}{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=441}} Lacking sources of information on the disposition of his own troops at the time, Valdan relied on that supplied by von Moltke in demarcating the lines of control of the two sides. Both sides were to withdraw ten miles from the lines of control and the area between the German siege works and the disarmed Parisian forts was to be neutral.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=34}}{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=442}} When Valdan had completed the technical military matters, Favre and Bismarck signed the final document on 28 January 1871.{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=34}} It immediately came into effect in Paris, and on 31 January in the other pertinent areas.{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=441}}

The [[Army of the East]] under General [[Justin Clinchant]], still operating in Jura, Doubs and Côte-d'Or, was not informed that the armistice did not apply to its area. Favre had neglected to inform the government in Bordeaux.{{sfn|Howard|1961|pp=430–31}} It mistakenly halted and was surrounded by the better-informed German troops of the [[Army of the South (Germany)|Army of the South]] under General [[Edwin von Manteuffel]].{{sfn|Kyte|1946|p=35}} On 31 January, having already negotiated safe passage for wounded soldiers into [[Switzerland]] and having received from his government confirmation that no armistice for his zone would be forthcoming, Clinchant signed a convention with the Swiss at the border post of [[Les Verrières]], allowing his army to retreat across the frontier.{{sfn|Howard|1961|pp=430–31}} On 1 February the whole road from [[Pontarlier]] to the border was filled with retreating toops, and the last skirmish of the war was [[Battle of La Cluse|fought at La Cluse]] by men of the reserve, who held off the Germans before joining their comrades in Switzerland.{{sfn|Howard|1961|pp=430–31}}

On 2 February news reached Versailles that on 27 January the Delegation of the Government of National Defence at Bordeaux had publicly proclaimed that "[w]e cannot believe that negotiations of this kind could have been undertaken without the Delegation being previously notified."{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=443}} The late arrival of this news had no effect on the armistice, and in the interim the Delegation had obeyed the order from Versailles to publish the armistice, inform the provincial armies and begin preparations for a general election. Nonetheless, when [[Jules Simon]], representing the government, met the Delegation in Bordeaux on 31 January, he ordered removed the placards that read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let us make use of the Armistice as a school for instruction for our young troops. . . In place of the reactionary and cowardly Assembly of which the enemy dreams, let us install an Assembly that is truly national and republican, desiring peace, if peace assures our honour ... but capable of willing war also, ready for anything rather than lend a hand in the murder of France.{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=444}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On 6 February the leader of the Delegation, Gambetta, resigned. On 8 February [[French legislative election, February 1871|the promised elections]] to the [[National Assembly (1871)|National Assembly]] took place. The body met in Bordeaux on 12 February. It had a monarchist majority and a mandate for peace. On 15 February the fort of Belfort under Colonel [[Pierre Philippe Denfert-Rochereau]] was finally incorporated into the armistice. Its defenders marched out with the honours of war on 18 February.{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=448}} On 19 February the members of the National Assembly swore the "[[Pact of Bordeaux]]", a truce between the parties until the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was established.

The armistice remained in effect even after the preliminary treaty of 26 February. Either was permitted to denounce it any day after 3 March, and to renew the fighting three days after that.{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=449}} On 1 March the Germans began their occupation of Paris. On 3 March they began to pull their troops out, yet riots erupted in Paris as the German troops marched out.{{sfn|Howard|1961|p=449}}

'''Arthur Cheney Train''' (September 6, 1875 &amp;ndash; December 22, 1945), also called '''Arthur Chesney Train''', was an American [[lawyer]] and writer of [[legal thrillers]], particularly known for his novels of [[courtroom]] intrigue and the creation of the fictional lawyer Mr. Ephraim Tutt.&lt;ref name="ATObit1945"/&gt;

==Early life==
Train was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on September 6, 1875. His father was lawyer [[Charles Russell Train]], who served for many years as attorney general of Massachusetts, and his mother was Sara Maria Cheney.&lt;ref name="ATObit1945"/&gt;

After attending [[St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], Train graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1896 and [[LLB]] from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1899.&lt;ref name="ANB"&gt;Schmid (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In January 1901, Train became assistant in the office of the [[New York County District Attorney]]. In 1904 he started his literary career with the publication of the [[short story]] "The Maximilian Diamond" in ''[[The American Magazine|Leslie's Monthly]]''. He ran the two careers in parallel until 1908 when he left the District Attorney's office to open a general law practice in the Mutual Life Building at 34 Nassau Street in New York City.&lt;ref name="ANB"/&gt; His 1907 novel, ''Mortmain'', was one of the earliest works in the [[alien hand syndrome]] genre and was adapted into a 1915 film of the same name that is now [[lost film|lost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortmain|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/AbbrView.aspx?s=1&amp;Movie=16569|publisher=American Film Institute Catalog|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other works by Train were filmed, including ''[[Illusion (1929 film)|Illusion]]'' (1929), ''[[His Children's Children]]'' (1923), and ''[[The Blind Goddess]]'' (1926).&lt;ref name="Munden"&gt;{{cite book |last1=American Film Institute |editor1-last=Munden |editor1-first=Kenneth White |title=The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States, Part 1 |date=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520209695 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rlLbRAPOgP0C&amp;pg=PA375&amp;dq=%22Arthur+Chesney+Train%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi23o2X6treAhXQfCsKHeSFBuw4ChDoAQg3MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Arthur%20Chesney%20Train%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1915 to 1922, Train was in private practice as a lawyer with [[Charles A. Perkins|Charles Albert Perkins]] while continuing to write, not just novels but short stories, plays, and [[journalism]]. In 1919, he created the popular character of Mr. Ephraim Tutt, a wily old lawyer who supported the common man and always had a trick up his sleeve to right the law's injustices.&lt;ref name="ANB"/&gt;

Train wrote dozens of stories about Tutt in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''. The fictional Ephraim Tutt became "the best known lawyer in America," particularly after the appearance of ''Yankee Lawyer,'' an immensely popular book that purported to be Tutt's autobiography. Train also coauthored two [[science fiction]] novels with eminent [[physicist]] [[Robert W. Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;Train &amp; Wood (1915), (1916)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1922, he devoted himself to writing.&lt;ref name="ANB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmid, D. (1999) "Train, Arthur", ''[[American National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, '''21''': 799-800, {{ISBN|0-19-520635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Train, A. C. (1939) ''My Day in Court'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons: Arthur Train's autobiography&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1897, Train married Ethel Kissam (1876–1923). Ethel was the daughter of Benjamin Kissam and Lucy ([[née]] Warren) Kissam, the niece of [[William Henry Vanderbilt|Maria (née Kissam) Vanderbilt]] and the first cousin of [[William Kissam Vanderbilt|William]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt II|Cornelius]], [[Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt|Margaret]], [[Emily Thorn Vanderbilt|Emily]], [[Florence Adele Vanderbilt Twombly|Florence]], [[Frederick William Vanderbilt|Frederick]], [[Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt Webb|Eliza]], and [[George Washington Vanderbilt II]]. Together, they had four children, including Arthur Kissam Train.&lt;ref name="ANB"/&gt;

Ethel died in 1923 and Train married Helen Coster Gerard in 1926, with whom he had one child [[John Train (investment advisor)|John Train]].&lt;ref name="ANB"/&gt;

Train died on December 22, 1945 in New York City.&lt;ref name="ATObit1945"&gt;{{cite news |title=ARTHUR TRAIN DEAD; CREATED 'MR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5073">In some jurisdictions, an '''assessor''' is a [[judge]]'s or [[magistrate]]'s assistant. This is the historical meaning of this word.

In [[common law]] jurisdictions, assessors are usually non-lawyers who sit together with a judge to provide either expert advice (such as on maritime matters) or guidance on local practices.  The use of assessors nowadays is quite rare.  In some jurisdictions, such as [[Fiji]], assessors are used in place of [[jury|juries]]. An assessor's opinion or view of a case is not binding on a judge.

The term "assessor" is also very generally applied to persons appointed to ascertain and fix the value of rates, taxes, &amp;c., and in this sense the word is used in the United States (see [[Assessor (property)]]).&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 780"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Assessor |volume=2|page=780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law jurisdictions==

In France and in all European countries where the civil law system prevails, the term ''assesseur'' is applied to those assistant judges who, with a president, compose a judicial court.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 780"/&gt;

===Denmark===

In [[Denmark]], it was the former title given to Supreme Court judges. Today the title is given to Deputy Judges. See [[Courts of Denmark]].

===Germany===

In [[Germany]],  ''Rechtsassessor'' ("assessor of law") is a title held by graduates of law who have passed both the first and the second of the two state exams (finishing law school and a two-year legal clerkship) qualifying for a career in a legal profession such as judge or prosecutor, attorney at law or civil-law notary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Assessor |volume=2|page=780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===

In [[Italy]], an [[assessor (Italy)|assessor]] (in [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''assessore'') is a member of a ''Giunta'', the executive body in all levels of [[local government]]: [[Regions of Italy|regions]], [[Provinces of Italy|provinces]] and [[Municipalities of Italy|communes]].

===Norway===

In Norway, the title was used for any judge before 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=assessor|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/assessor|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===

In Sweden, a judge who has been a district court clerk for two years, an appeal court clerk for at least one year, a deputy district judge for at least two years and a deputy appeal court judge for one year gets, if he or she is approved, the title assessor. Hovrättsassessor = assessor of the civil and criminal appeal court. Kammarrättsassessor = assessor of the administrative appeal court. Having the degree of assessor is the most common way of getting a constitutionally protected position as a judge (ordinarie domare), but increasingly advocates, prosecutors and doctors of law are also appointed to these positions.

===Soviet Union and PRC===

In the former [[Soviet Union]] and modern [[People's Republic of China]], a judge presiding at trial is assisted by two "people's assessors" drawn much like jurors from citizens in the community. They do not rule on matters of law but can allow or deny objections. When the trial is completed the judge and people's assessors decide on a verdict.

===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===

In the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], assessors were also members of the judiciary, sitting on the so-called [[kanclerz|kanclerz's courts]] or [[assessor's courts]].

==Common law jurisdictions==

===Fiji===

Serious criminal trials are conducted by a [[judge]] sitting with four lay assessors.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Duff, "The evolution of trial by judge and assessors in Fiji", The Journal of Pacific Studies, Volume 21, 1997, 189–213&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===

S.53 of the High Court Ordinance provides that a judge in the Court of First Instance may sit with one or more assessor who holds special qualifications.  It is not normal practice for the court to sit with assessors.&lt;ref&gt;s.53 Hong Kong High Court Ordinance&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===

In serious criminal cases (such as murder) appearing before the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]], two assessors may be appointed to assist the judge. Assessors are usually [[advocate]]s or retired [[magistrate]]s. They sit with the judge during the court case and listen to all the evidence presented to the court. At the end of the court case they give the judge their opinion. The judge does not have to listen to the assessors' opinions but it usually helps the judge to make a decision. The assessors may also only make decisions on facts, not on the law, which is solely the authority of the judge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/salrc/ipapers/IP26.pdf South African Law Reform Commission Issue Paper 26,para 2.9 and 2.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6366">The '''Block Exemption Regulation''' is an exemption in a business line or industry, which debars organizations in the industry from some business activities in order to create competition. The regulation is highly known in the automobile industry due to the effect caused by the Block Exemption Regulation (BER) from the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/legislation/block.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[European Union competition law]]&lt;/ref&gt; BER has changed the automobile industry in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackcircles.com/servicing/about/block-exemption&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2003 automobile owners in the EU region risk nullifying their vehicle warranty when the vehicles were serviced or repaired in workshops not belonging to the vehicle manufacturer or its dealers. This barrier was broken in October 2003, when the European Commission (EC) passed a law allowing vehicle owners the freedom of having their servicing and repairs done at their chosen workshop.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:l:2002:203:0030:0041:en:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the UK Department of Business Education &amp; Skills, the empowerment created by this law provides competition in the automobile industry as vehicle owners now have the opportunity to repair and service their vehicle at alternative workshops to the automobile manufacturers. BER provides automobile users the flexibility and benefit to reduce the amount spent on servicing, thereby providing consumers more choice and better value for money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090703112314/http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/consumers/fact-sheets/page38070.html National Archives (UK)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===New Block Exemption Regulation===
The block exemption regulations are updated regularly to create competition among the [[Member State of the European Union]]. According to a [[White Paper]] by Dr.Jai Ganesh, Dr. Srinivas Padmanabhuni and Anandhi r, "Changes to the block exemption regulations (BER) are meant to increase competitiveness in the automobile retail industry in Europe"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosys.com/offerings/industries/automotive/white-papers/Documents/webservices-BER.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705094126/http://www.infosys.com/offerings/industries/automotive/white-papers/Documents/webservices-BER.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002 a BER was passed into law and it came fully into effect in October 2003. The regulation was passed into law because the preceding law did not cover adequately some key point. The October 2002 BER focused on new automobile sales, after-sales and distribution. The preceding BER did not cover the following points adequately:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-leipzig.de/wirtschaftsrecht/dokumente/KfzGruppVOSlides.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* Competition between dealers of the same brand
* Problems occurring for cross-border sales
* The need to strengthen dealers’ position vis-à-vis manufacturers
* Competition in the after-sales servicing


The AIRC, Association International des Reparateurs en Carrosserie, made clear that the after sales market needed a satisfactory framework that would not threaten consumers’ freedom,insurance companies freedom, fleet owners freedom and leasing companies freedom to have their
vehicles repaired in the workshop of their choice. ( AIRC General Secretary Karel Bukholczer, see source http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consultations/2010_motor_vehicles/airc_en.pdf )



Recently, in May 2010 a new law has passed by the European Commission Competition legislatives and it came into effect from June 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/motor_vehicles/legislation/legislation.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/motor_vehicles/block_exemption.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==The automobile industry==
Several countries in the EU region responded to the EC block exemption regulations with strategies to enforce them, making competition better among automobile dealers and manufacturers in their countries. An example of this is the ‘Car Notice’ passed by the Swiss Competition Commission in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp11034.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A transition period was provided by the European Commission extends the previous 2002 for three years, till 2013.  During this three years only the sales of new cars are affected by the new BER passed by the EC which came into effect on 1 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/business-law/competition-matters/competition-policy/european-competition-policy/eu-motor-vehicle-block-exemption-regulation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524141959/http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/business-law/competition-matters/competition-policy/european-competition-policy/eu-motor-vehicle-block-exemption-regulation |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">The '''Ministry of Justice and Security of the Netherlands''' oversees the heads the Public [[Prosecutor|Prosecution]] Service. The Public Prosecutor typically leads the investigation in a criminal matter, and the Public Prosecution Service ensures that the sentence given by the judges are properly executed. In addition. the service monitors any fines and penalties, the imprisonment process, and any required community service. 

In turn, the Public Prosecution Service BES is responsible for the criminal enforcement of the legal order on [[Bonaire]], [[Saba]], and [[Sint Eustatius]]. Each island has an independent Public Prosecution's Office that contains a Public Prosecutor—all of whom are under the leadership of a Chief Prosecutor. 

The Public Prosecution Service overall works in tandem with a joint Attorney General and Advocate General.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.openbaarministerie.org/en/organisation/about-the-public-prosecution-services|title=About The Public Prosecution Services - Openbaar Ministerie-Curacao-Sint Maarten-BES Islands|website=Openbaar Ministerie-Curacao-Sint Maarten-BES Islands|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collections of ancient canons''' contain collected bodies of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] that originated in various documents, such as papal and synodal decisions, and that can be designated by the generic term of canons.

Canon law was not a finished product from the beginning, but rather a gradual growth. This is especially true of the earlier Christian centuries. Such written laws as existed were not originally universal laws, but local or provincial statutes. Hence arose the necessity of collecting or codifying them. Earlier collections are brief and contain few laws that are chronologically certain. Only with the increase of legislation did a methodical classification become necessary.

These collections may be genuine (e. g. the ''[[Versio Hispanica]]''), or apocryphal, i.e. made with the help of documents forged, interpolated, wrongly attributed or otherwise defective (e. g. the [[Pseudo-Isidore]] collection). They may be official and authentic (i.e. [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgated]] by competent authority) or private, the work of individuals. The forged collections of the middle of the ninth century  are treated in the article on [[False Decretals]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Much of our knowledge of these matters is owing to the historical researches begun at the end of the sixteenth century, whence issued the critical editions of the Church Fathers, the councils, and the papal decretals. See: the dissertation (''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', LVI) of the [[Ballerini brothers]] of Verona (eighteenth century) "Concerning the ancient collection and collectors of Canons as far as Gratian"; and the history of the sources and literature of canon law by {{harvp|Maassen|1870}}; he stops at Pseudo-Isidore.&lt;/ref&gt;

==From the earliest to the apocryphal collections==

===The apostolic period===
{{main|Ancient Church Orders}}
In the primitive Christian ages there were apocryphal collections attributed to the Apostles, which belong to the ''[[genre]]'' of the [[Ancient Church Orders|Church Orders]]. The most important of these  are the [[Didache|Doctrine of the Twelve Apostles]], the [[Apostolic Constitutions]], and the [[Apostolic Canons]].

The Apostolic Constitutions, though originally accepted throughout the Orient, were declared apocryphal in the [[Trullan Council]] of 692; they were never accepted as ecclesiastical law in the West. The Apostolic Canons (eighty-five) were, on the other hand, approved by the Trullan Council.

[[Dionysius Exiguus]], a Western canonist of the first half of the sixth century, noted that "many accept with difficulty the so-called canons of the Apostles". Nevertheless, he admitted into his collection the first fifty of these canons. The so-called ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'', ''de libris non recipiendis'' (about the sixth century), puts them among the apocrypha.

From the collection of Dionysius Exiguus they passed into many Western collections, though their authority was never on one level. They were admitted at Rome in the ninth century in ecclesiastical decisions but in the eleventh century [[Cardinal Humbert]] accepts only the first fifty.&lt;ref&gt;''Adversus Simoniacos'', I, 8, and ''Contra Nicætam'', 16 ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', CXLIII.&lt;/ref&gt; Only two of them (20, 29) found their way into the ''[[Decretals of Gregory IX]]''.

===Papal decretals===
In primitive Christian centuries, the popes carried on ecclesiastical government by means of an active and extensive correspondence. We learn from a synod of the year 370, under [[Pope Damasus I|Pope Damasus]], that the minutes of their letters or [[decretals]] were kept in the papal archives; these [[Vatican Archives]] have perished up to the time of [[pope John VIII]] (died 882). In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries attempts were made to reconstruct them.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The most successful is that of {{harvp|Jaffé|1885}}; cf. the important revision of Jaffé by {{harvp|Kehr|1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period under discussion (i. e. to the middle of the eleventh century) there was a constant use of the papal decretals by the compilers of canonical collections from the sixth century on.

===Greek collections===
{{main|Nomocanon}}
In 451 there was quoted at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] a collection of councils no longer extant, nor has the name of the compiler ever transpired.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;It seems to have been based on the canons of Ancyra (314) and Neo-Cæsarea (314-25), to which were added later those of Gangra (36-70).&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the collection were then placed the decrees of Nicæa (325); subsequently the canons of Antioch (341) were included, in which shape it was known to the Fathers of Chalcedon. In the latter part of the fifth century the canons of Laodicæa (343-81), Constantinople (381), Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451), were incorporated with this ecclesiastical code, and finally (after the canons of Neo-Cæsarea) the decrees of Sardica (343-44), in which form the collection was in use during the sixth century. Though unofficial in character, it represents (inclusive of sixty-eight canons taken from the "Canonical Epistles" of St. Basil, I, III) the conciliar discipline of the Greek Church between 500 and 600.

This collection was chronological in order. Towards 535 an unknown compiler classified its materials in a methodical way under sixty titles, and added to the canons twenty-one imperial constitutions relative to ecclesiastical matters taken from the Code of Justinian. This collection has been lost.

Some years later (540-550) [[Johannes Scholasticus]], Patriarch of Constantinople, made use of this code to compile a new methodical collection, which he divided into fifty books.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;It is printed in the second volume of {{harvp|Voel|Justel|1661}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the emperor's death (565), the patriarch extracted from ten of the former's constitutions, known as "Novellæ", some eighty-seven chapters and added them to the aforesaid collection.

In this way arose the mixed collections known as [[Nomocanon]]s (Greek ''nomoi'' "laws", ''kanones'' "canons"), containing not only ecclesiastical laws but also imperial laws pertaining to the same matters. The first of these was published under Emperor Maurice (582-602); under each title were given, after the canons, the corresponding civil laws.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;This collection (wrongly attributed to the aforementioned patriarch) is also found in the second volume of {{harvp|Voel|Justel|1661}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quinisext Council]] (695) of Constantinople, called Trullan from the hall of the palace (''in trullo'') where it was held, issued 102 disciplinary canons; it included also the canons of the former councils and certain patristic regulations, all of which it considered constitutive elements of the ecclesiastical law of the East. This collection contains, therefore, an official enumeration of the canons which then governed the Eastern Church, but no official approbation of a given collection or particular text of these canons. It is to be noted that the Apostolic See never fully approved this council. In 787 a similar recapitulation of the ancient canons was made by the [[Second Council of Nicæa]].

===Italo-Latin collections===

====Latin Version of the Canons of Nicæa and Sardica====

The former council (325) was held in repute throughout the West, where its canons were in vigour together with those of Sardica, the complement of the anti-Arian legislation of Nicæa, and whose decrees had been drawn up originally in both Latin and Greek. The canons of the two councils were numbered in running order, as though they were the work of but one council (a trait met with in divers Latin collections), which explains why the Council of Sardica is sometimes called œcumenical by earlier writers, and its canons attributed to the Council of Nicæa.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For the text of the version as found in the various collections see {{harvp|Maassen|1870|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest versions of these canons quoted in the papal decretals are no longer extant.

====The "Hispana" or "Isidoriana" Version====

Towards the middle of the fifth century, perhaps earlier, there appeared a Latin version of the aforesaid canons of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicæa]], [[Ancyra]], [[Niksar|Neo-Cæsarea]] and [[Gangra]], to which were added a little later those of [[Antioch]], [[Laodicæa]] and [[Constantinople]]; the canons of [[Sardica]] were inserted about the same time after those of Gangra. Bickell considers it possible that this version was made in Northern Africa, while Walter inclines to Spain; it is now generally believed that the version was made in Italy. It was long believed, however, that it came from Spain, hence the name of "Hispana" or "Isidoriana", the latter term derived from its insertion in the collection attributed to St. Isidore of Seville (see below, Spanish Collections), in which it was edited, of course according to the text followed by the Spanish compiler.

====The "Prisca" or "Itala" Version====

This too seems to have grown up gradually in the course of the fifth century, and in its present shape exhibits the aforementioned canons of Ancyra, Neo-Cæsarea, Nicæa, Sardica, Gangra, Antioch, Chalcedon and Constantinople. It came to be known as "Itala" from the place of its origin, and as "Prisca" because of an overhasty conclusion that Dionysius Exiguus referred to it in the preface of his first collection when he wrote: "Laurentius offended by the confusion that reigned in the ancient version [priscœ versionis]".&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;It was edited by Voel and [[Henri Justel]] in the first volume of their above-quoted "Bibliotheca juris canonici veteris"; a better text is that of the Ballerini brothers in the third volume of their edition of the works of St. Leo. ''Patrologia Latina'' LVI, 746.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Collectio canonum Quesnelliana"====
{{main|Collectio canonum Quesnelliana}}

At the beginning of the sixth century there arose in Italy an extensive collection, based apparently on the "Antiqua Isidoriana" and the African collections, and which, besides the earliest Eastern and the African councils, includes papal decretals (especially Leonine), letters of Gallican bishops and other documents. Older scholarship, beginning with the Ballerinis, argued that the "Quesnelliana" was a Gallic collection, though one with an admittedly "Roman colour". More recent scholarship has argued for an Italian, possibly even Roman origin. Its name is derived from the [[Oratory of Jesus|Oratorian]] P. Quesnel, its first editor. With its focus on Chalcedon and the letters of Leo, the "Quesnelliana" is quite obviously meant as a manifesto against the Acacian schism, in which eastern Bishops led by Acacius, patriarch of Constantinople, challenged the decisions of the council of Chalcedon and the Christology set down in Pope Leo’s "Tomus". The compiler’s principal of selection thus seems to have been any and all documents that support doctrinal unity in general and Leonine Christology in particular. Of the large chronological canon collections to have come out of the early Middle Ages, the "Quesnelliana" is perhaps the oldest surviving collection and, after the "Collectio Dionysiana" and "Collectio Hispana", probably the most influential. It remained a popular work well into the ninth century, particularly in Francia. Most likely this was because of the numerous papal letters it contained that dealt with disciplinary matters that retained ecclesiastical importance throughout the Middle Ages. The Quesnelliana played a particularly important role in the spread of Leo’s letters in Western canonistic literature, and was notably instrumental in the compilations of pseudo-Isidore for just this reason. Manuscript evidence alone indicates that the Quesnelliana had a fairly wide dissemination in Gaul during the eighth and ninth centuries; though it had perhaps already found a welcome audience with Gallo-Frankish bishops in the sixth century, when it may have been used as a source (along with the "Sanblasiana") for the "Collectio Colbertina" and the "Collectio Sancti Mauri". By the mid-eighth century, the "Quesnelliana" had secured its place as an important lawbook within the Frankish episcopate, for whom it served as the primary source during the influential council of Verneuil in 755.

====Collections of Dionysius Exiguus====
{{main|Collectiones canonum Dionysianae}}

Further collections were called for by the increasing canonical material of the [[Latin West]] in the course of the fifth century. They were far from satisfactory.

Towards 500 a [[Scythian monk]], known as [[Dionysius Exiguus]], who had come to Rome after the death of [[Pope Gelasius I|Pope Gelasius]] (496), and who was well skilled in both Latin and Greek, undertook to bring out a more exact translation of the canons of the Greek councils. In a second effort he collected papal decretals from [[Siricius]] (384-89) to [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]] (496-98), inclusive, anterior therefore, to [[Pope Symmachus]] (514-23). By order of [[Pope Hormisdas]] (514-23), Dionysius made a third collection, in which he included the original text of all the canons of the Greek councils, together with a Latin version of the same; but the preface alone has survived. Finally, he combined the first and second in one collection, which thus united the canons of the councils and the papal decretals; it is in this shape that the work of Dionysius has reached us. This collection opens with a table or list of titles, each of which is afterwards repeated before the respective canons; then come the first fifty canons of the Apostles, the canons of the Greek councils, the canons of Carthage (419), and the canons of preceding African synods under Aurelius, which had been read and inserted in the Council of Carthage. This first part of the collection is closed by a letter of Pope [[Boniface I]], read at the same council, letters of [[Cyril of Alexandria]] and [[Atticus of Constantinople]] to the African Fathers, and a letter of Pope [[Celestine I]]. The second part of the collection opens likewise with a preface, in the shape of a letter to the priest Julian, and a table of titles; then follow one decretal of [[Siricius]], twenty-one of [[Innocent I]], one of [[Zozimus]], four of [[Boniface I]], three of [[Celestine I]], seven of [[pope Leo I]], one of [[Gelasius I]] and one of [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]]. The additions met with in Voel and Justel are taken from inferior manuscripts.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;It was first printed in the first volume of {{harvp|Voel|Justel|1661}}, re-edited by Lepelletier (Paris, 1687), and reprinted in ''Patrologia Latina'' LXVII. A more satisfactory edition is that of [[Cuthbert Hamilton Turner]], in ''Ecclesiæ Occidentalis Monumenta Juris Antiquissima'' (Oxford, 1899-1939), vol. II, fasc. II.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Avellana collection====
It is so called because its oldest known manuscript was bought for the abbey of [[Santa Croce Avellana]] by [[St. Peter Damian]] (died 1073), probably dates from the middle of the sixth century. It follows neither chronological nor logical order, and seems to have grown to its present shape according as the compiler met with the materials that he has transmitted to us. Nevertheless, [[Girolamo Ballerini]] and [[Pietro Ballerini]] pronounce it a valuable collection because of the great number of early canonical documents (nearly 200) that are found in no other collection.

All its texts are authentic, save eight letters from divers persons to Peter, Bishop of Antioch. The best edition is Otto Günther: ''Epistvlae imperatorvm pontificvm aliorvm inde ab a. CCCLXVII vsqve ad a. DLIII datae Avellana qvae dicitvr collectio.'' Corpus scriptorum ecclesiasticorum latinorum, vol. 35. Vindobonae: F. Tempsky, 1895.

====Other collections====

Despite the popularity of Dionysius Exiguus, which caused the previous compilations to be disused, several of them were preserved, as also were some other contemporary collections.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;See the above-quoted dissertation of the Ballerini, II, iv, and {{harvp|Maassen|1870|pp=476, 526, 721}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Suffice it to mention the collection known as the "Chieti" or "Vaticana Reginæ", through which a very old and distinct version of the decrees of the Council of Nicæa has reached us.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;It has been edited by the Ballerini (''Patrologia Latina'' LVI, 818).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection of the African Church===

====Canons of the African Councils====

From the Eastern Church Northern Africa received only the decrees of Nicæa (325), which it owed to [[Cæcilianus of Carthage]], one of the Nicene Fathers. The African Church created its domestic code of discipline in its own councils. It was customary to read and confirm in each council the canons of preceding councils, in which way there grew up collections of conciliar decrees, but purely local in authority. Their [[moral authority]], however, was great, and from the Latin collections they eventually made their way into the Greek collections. The best-known are: (a) the Canons of the Council of Carthage (August, 397) which confirmed the "Breviarium" of the canons of Hippo (393), one of the chief sources of African ecclesiastical discipline; (b) the Canons of the Council of Carthage (419), at which were present 217 bishops and among whose decrees were inserted 105 canons of previous councils.

====Statuta Ecclesiæ Antiqua====

In the second part of the ''Hispana'' (see below) and in other collections are found, together with other African councils, 104 canons which the compiler of the ''Hispana'' attributes to a Pseudo-Fourth Council of Carthage of 398. These canons are often known as ''Statuta Ecclesiæ Antiqua'', and in some manuscripts are entitled ''Statuta antiqua Orientis''.

[[Hefele]] maintains that in spite of their erroneous attribution, these canons are authentic, or at least summaries of authentic canons of ancient African councils, and collected in their present shape before the end of the sixth century. On the other hand, [[Maassen]], [[Louis Duchesne]], and [[Arthur Malnory]] believe them a compilation made at [[Arles]] in the first part of the sixth century; Malnory specifies [[Caesarius of Arles]] as their author.

====The "Breviatio Canonum"====

Compiled c. 546 by [[Fulgentius Ferrandus]], it is a methodical collection and under its seven titles disposes 230 abridged canons of Greek ("Hispana" text) and African councils. Fulgentius was a deacon of Carthage and disciple of [[St. Fulgentius of Ruspe]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The text is in ''Patrologia Latina'' LXVII.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The "Concordia" of Cresconius====

[[Cresconius Africanus]], apparently a bishop, compiled his collection about 690. It is based on that of Dionysius Exiguus; only, in place of reproducing in full each canon, it cuts it up to suit the demands of the titles used; hence its name of "Concordia". Between the preface and the text of the collection the writer inserted a resume of his work.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;This took on the name of "Breviatio Canonum" which led some to imagine that the latter title implied a work other than the "Concordia", whereas it meant only a part or rather the preamble of the latter, whose text is in ''Patrologia Latina'' LXXXVIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collections of the Spanish Church===
These comprise the collections that arose in the lands once under Visigothic rule — Spain, Portugal, and Southern Gaul. In this territory councils were very frequent, especially after the conversion of [[King Reccared]] (587), and they paid much attention to ecclesiastical discipline.

Such collections contain, besides the decrees of Spanish synods, the canons also of Nicæa and Sardica (accepted in the Spanish Church from the beginning), those of the Greek councils known through the "Itala", and those of the Gallican and African Councils, quite influential in the formation of Spanish ecclesiastical discipline. Three of these collections are important.

====The "Capitula Martini"====

It is divided into two parts, one dealing with the bishop and his clergy, the other relative to the laity; in both the author classifies methodically the canons of the councils in eighty-four chapters. He says himself in the preface that he does not pretend to reproduce the text literally, but with set purpose breaks up, abridges, or glosses the same, in order to make it more intelligible to "simple people"; possibly he has occasionally modified it to suit the Spanish discipline of his time. Though much has been borrowed from Latin, Gallican and African Councils, the Greek Councils furnish the greater part of the canons. The "Capitula" were read and approved at the [[Second Council of Braga]] in 572. Some writers, misled by the name, attributed them to [[Pope Martin I]]; they are in reality the work of [[Martin of Pannonia]], better known as Martin of Braga, of which place he was archbishop in the sixth century. Their text was incorporated with the "Isidoriana", from which they were taken and edited apart by Merlin and by Gaspar Loaisa, and in the first volume of the oft-quoted work by Voel and Justel, after collation of the variants in the best manuscripts.

====The Spanish "Epitome"====

This is the name of the collection edited by the Ballerini&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Latina'' III, IV&lt;/ref&gt; from two manuscripts (Verona and Lucca). It has two parts: one includes the canons of Greek, African, Gallican and Spanish councils; the other divers papal decretals from [[Siricius]] to [[Pope Vigilius]] (384-555), with two apocryphal texts of [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement]] and an extract from [[St. Jerome]]. The compiler designedly abridged his texts, and mentions only three sources, a Braga collection (the "Capitula Martini", his first chapter being a resume of that work), an [[Alcalá de Henares|Alcalá]] (''Complutum'') collection, and one of Cabra (Agrabensis). Though characterized by lack of order and exactness, the "Epitome" interests us because of the antiquity of its sources. Maassen thinks it connected with the "Codex Canonum", the nucleus of the group of collections whence eventually issued the "Hispana", and of which we shall treat apropos of the latter.

====The "Hispana" or "Isidoriana"====
This must not be confused with the above-described "Versio Hispanica" or "Isidoriana", among the earlier Latin collections, and which contained only canons of Greek councils.

The collection in question, like that of Dionysius Exiguus on which it is based, contains two parts: the first includes canons of Greek, African, Gallican and Spanish councils, with some letters of [[St. Cyril of Alexandria]] and [[Atticus of Constantinople]], while the second has the papal decretals as found in Dionysius, together with some others, most of the latter addressed to Spanish bishops. This is the chronological "Hispana". Somewhat later, towards the end of the seventh century, it was recast in logical order, by some unknown writer, and divided into ten books, which were again subdivided into titles and chapters. This is the methodical "Hispana". Finally, the copyists were wont to place at the beginning of the chronological "Hispana" a table of contents of the methodical collection, but with references to the text of the chronological: in this shape it was known as the "Excerpta Canonum". The chronological "Hispana" seems to have been originally the "Codex Canonum" mentioned at the Fourth [[Council of Toledo]] (633), with later additions. In the ninth century it was attributed, with insufficient evidence, to [[St. Isidore of Seville]].

In spite of this erroneous attribution, the "Hispana" contains very few documents of doubtful authenticity. Later on, additions were made to it, the latest being taken from the seventeenth council of Toledo (694). In this enlarged form, i. e. the "Codex Canonum", the "Hispana" was approved by [[Pope Alexander III]] as authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Innocent III, Ep. 121, to Peter, Archbishop of Compostella.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the thirteenth century, its authority was great in Spain. Pseudo-Isidore  made a generous use of its materials.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;See the text in ''Patrologia Latina'', LXXXXIV, reprinted from the edition of Madrid, 1808-21, executed at the Royal Printing House.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallican collections===

====Codex Carolinus====
The "Codex Carolinus" is a collection of papal decretals addressed to the Frankish rulers [[Charles Martel]], [[Pippin the Younger]] and [[Charlemagne]], compiled by the latter's order in 791 (''Patrologia Latina'' XCVIII), not to be confounded with the "[[Libri Carolini]]" in which were set forth for Pope Adrian I various points concerning the veneration of images.

===English and Celtic collections===
Michael Elliot has characterized the history of canon law collections in [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]] as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/43550 M. Elliot, ''Canon Law Collections in England ca 600–1066: The Manuscript Evidence'' (Unpublished PhD dissertation, University of Toronto, 2013)], 3–6&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[B]oth the dissemination of canon law collections within the Anglo-Saxon church and the study of canon law collections by Anglo-Saxon clergy were considerable indeed; even if they were not as popular as in some Continental churches, canon law collections served the Anglo-Saxon church as indispensable disciplinary, educational and administrative tools. Beginning in the seventh and eighth centuries, and fuelled by the early Anglo-Saxon church’s strong ties to Roman models, one sees in England the considerable influence of Italian canon law collections, most notably the ''collectiones [[Collectio canonum Dionysiana|Dionysiana]]'', ''[[Collectio canonum Sanblasiana|Sanblasiana]]'' and ''[[Collectio canonum Quesnelliana|Quesnelliana]]''. It was particularly at [[York]] and especially at [[Canterbury]] under the guidance of [[Theodore of Tarsus|Archbishop Theodore]] that instruction in and study of these collections appears to have been carried out with the most fervour. In the eighth century, imbued with the legal teachings of these collections, reform-minded Anglo-Saxon personnel descended on the [[Low Countries]] and the lands east of the [[Rhine]], bringing with them the institutional framework and disciplinary models they had inherited from their Roman and Celtic mentors. These included the collections already mentioned and also copies of the [[Collectio canonum Hibernensis|Collectio Hibernensis]] and several different types of [[penitential]] handbooks. It was also during this time that an important redaction of the [[Collectio canonum vetus Gallica|Collectio vetus Gallica]] was disseminated on the Continent, due in part to the activities of Anglo-Saxon personnel. This acme of Anglo-Saxon canonical scholarship―exemplified from the seventh to late eighth century by such figures as [[Wilfrid]], [[Ecgbert (bishop)|Ecgberht]], [[Saint Boniface|Boniface]], and [[Alcuin]]―seems to have ended sometime in the ninth century, probably as a result of the devastation of the [[Viking]] raids, which inflicted heavy losses upon England’s material and intellectual culture. In England, interest in and the manuscript resources necessary to carry out the study of Continental canonical sources would never again under the Anglo-Saxons reach the level they had attained in the first two hundred years of the English church's existence. Following the eighth century, the Anglo-Saxon church seems to have developed an increasingly strong tradition of operating juridically within the pre-existing secular legal framework. In this tradition―which lasted from at least the end of the ninth century until the [[Norman conquest of England|Conquest]] and beyond―the legal and disciplinary spirit of the English church stood close to and drew support from the emerging strength of [[Wessex|West Saxon]] kingship. Consequently, for the duration of the Anglo-Saxon period Continental canon law collections played a correspondingly smaller role in influencing the law and discipline of the church and its members. But they never became obsolete, and indeed an upsurge of interest in these collections can be seen taking place in the tenth and early eleventh centuries. New genres of canonical literature had been gaining in popularity on the Continent since the early ninth century. Most important among these, as far as Anglo-Saxon history is concerned, were the large penitential and canonico-penitential collections of the [[Carolingian]] period. A number of these collections crossed the [[English Channel|Channel]] into England during the tenth century and were well received by the Anglo-Saxon episcopacy. By the beginning of the eleventh century, especially with the activities of Abbot [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Ælfric]] and [[Wulfstan (died 1023)|Archbishop Wulfstan]], study of canon law collections had once again attained a degree of sophistication in England. Nevertheless, despite England’s increasingly tight connections to the ecclesiastical traditions of the Continent―where the study of canon law thrived in the eleventh century―there are few signs that Ælfric’s and Wulfstan’s achievements in canonical scholarship were continued by their Anglo-Saxon successors in any significant way. Following the Conquest England saw the introduction of [[Normans|Norman]] libraries and personnel into England, a development that marks a very real terminus to the history of the Anglo-Saxon canonical tradition. The new ecclesiastical reforms and drastically different canonical preoccupations of Archbishop [[Lanfranc]] put the study of canon law in England upon entirely new foundations. With the accumulation of new texts and collections, and with the development of new scientific principles for their interpretation, ground was laid for Anglo-Norman England’s contribution to the monumental canonical reforms of the twelfth century―reforms in which the by now long outmoded Anglo-Saxon canonical tradition played (almost) no part.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
The most celebrated of the Celtic canonical productions is the ''[[Collectio Hibernensis]]'', of the early part of the eighth century, whose compiler put together previous ecclesiastical legislation in sixty-four to sixty-nine chapters, preceded by extracts from the "Etymologiæ" of St. Isidore of Seville concerning synodal regulations. The preface states that for the sake of brevity and clearness and to reconcile certain juridical antinomies, effort is made to render the sense of the canons rather than their letter. It is a methodical collection to the extent that the matters treated are placed in their respective chapters, but there is much confusion in the distribution of the latter. In spite of its defects, this collection made its way into France and Italy and until the twelfth century influenced the ecclesiastical legislation of churches in both countries (Paul Fournier, De l'influence de la collection irlandaise sur les collections canoniques).

===Particular collections===
Apart from the above-described general collections there are some special or particular collections that deserve brief mention. 
# Some of them deal with a particular [[heresy]] or [[Schism (religion)|schism]], e. g. the collections of [[Tours]], [[Verona]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Monte Cassino]], those of Notre Dame, of [[Rustiens]], the [[Novaro-Vaticana]] and the "[[Codex Encyclius]]" relative to [[Eutyches]] and the [[Council of Chalcedon]], the "Veronensis" and the "Virdunensis" in the [[affair of Acacius]].
# Others contain the documents and juridical texts that concern an individual church or country, e. g. the collection of [[Arles]], in which were gathered the privileges of that Church, the collections of [[Lyon]], [[Beauvais]], [[Saint-Amand (disambiguation)|Saint-Amand]], [[Fécamp]] etc., in which were brought together the canons of the councils of France.
# In the same category may be placed the ''capitula'' or episcopal statutes, i. e. decisions and regulations collected from Various quarters by local bishops for the use and direction of their clergy (see [[Capitularies]]), e. g. the "Capitula" of [[Theodulf of Orléans]], end of the eighth century (''Patrologia Latina'' CV), of [[Hatto of Basle]] (882, in ''[[Mon. Germ. Hist.]]: Leges'', 1, 439-41) and of [[Boniface of Mainz]] (745, in D'Achéry, Spicilegium, ed. nova I, 597).
# Still other collections deal with some special point of discipline. Such are the ancient liturgical collections called by the Greeks "[[Euchologia]]" and by the Latins "Libri mysteriorum" or "- sacramentorum", more usually "[[Sacramentaries]]", also since the eighth century the ''[[Ordines Romani]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Latina'' LXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; Here also belong the collections of ecclesiastical ''formulæ'' (see [[Books of Formularies]]), especially the ''[[Liber Diurnus]]'' of the [[Roman Chancery]], compiled probably between 685 and 782 (''Patrologia Latina'' CV, 11), edited by Garnier (Paris, 1680) and anew by M. de Rozières (Paris, 1869) and by Th. Sickel (Vienna, 1889). Special mention is due to the [[Penitential Books]] (''Libri Pœnitentiales''), collections of penitential canons, councils and catalogues of ecclesiastical sanctions, to which were gradually added rules for the administration of the [[Sacrament of Penance]].

===Collections of ecclesiastico-civil laws===
The civil law as such has no standing in the canonical forum but in her first centuries of existence the Church often rounded out her canonical legislation by adopting certain provisions of the secular laws. Moreover, either by mutual agreement, as under the [[Carolingian]] kings, or by the civil power's usurpation of ecclesiastical domain, as frequently happened under the Byzantine emperors, the civil authority legislated on matters in themselves purely canonical; such laws it behooved an ecclesiastic to know. Moreover, the priest often needs some acquaintance with the pertinent civil law in order to decide properly even in purely secular matters that are occasionally submitted to him. Hence the utility of collections of civil laws concerning ecclesiastical matters or the administration of the canonical laws (''praxis canonica''). We have already noted in the East the collections known as "[[Nomocanones]]"; the West also had mixed collections of the same nature. 
# Collections of [[Roman Law]]. This law interested quite particularly the ecclesiastics of the barbarian kingdoms that rose on the ruins of the Western Empire, since they continued to live by it (Ecclesia vivit lege romana); moreover, apart from the laws of the Anglo-Saxons, the legislation of all the barbarian peoples of Gaul, Spain, and Italy was profoundly Influenced by the Roman law. (a) The "Lex romana canonice compta", apparently compiled in Lombardy during the ninth century, and handed down in a manuscript of the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris. It includes portions of the "Institutiones" of the "Codex" of Justinian and of the "Epitome" of Julian.
# Capitularies of the [[Frankish Kings]]. The laws of the latter were very favourable to religious interests; not a few of them were the result of the mutual deliberations of both the civil and the ecclesiastical power. Hence the exceptional authority of the [[royal capitularies]] before ecclesiastical tribunals. In the first half of the ninth century [[Ansegisus]], [[Abbey of Saint Wandrille|Abbot of Fontenelles]] (823-33), collected in four books capitularies of Charlemagne, [[Louis the Pious]] and [[Lothaire I]]; the first two books contain provisions concerning the "ecclesiastical order", the latter two exhibit the "law of the world". Ansegisus himself added three appendixes. His work was widely used in France, Germany and Italy, and was quoted in [[diet (assembly)|diets]] and councils as an authentic collection.

This rapid sketch exhibits the vitality of the Church from the earliest centuries, and her constant activity for the preservation of ecclesiastical discipline. During this long elaboration the Greek Church unifies her legislation, but accepts little from beyond her own boundaries. On the other hand, the Western Church, with perhaps the sole exception of Africa, makes progress in the development of local discipline and exhibits an anxiety to harmonize particular legislation with the decretals of the popes, the canons of general councils, and the special legislation of the rest of the Church. Doubtless in the above-described collection of canons, the result of this long disciplinary development, we meet with forged decrees of councils and decretals of popes, even with forged collections, e. g. the collections of pseudo-Apostolic legislation. Nevertheless, the influence of these apocryphal works on other canonical collections was restricted. The latter were, almost universally, made up of authentic documents. Canonical science in the future would have been nourished exclusively from legitimate sources had not a larger number of forged documents appeared about the middle of the ninth century (Capitula of [[Benedict Levita]], Capitula Angilramni, Canons of Isaac of Langres, above all the collection of Pseudo-Isidore. See [[False Decretals]]). But ecclesiastical vigilance did not cease; in the West especially, the Church kept up an energetic protest against the decay of her discipline; witness the many councils, diocesan synods and mixed assemblies of bishops and civil officials, also the numerous (over forty) new canonical collections from the ninth to the beginning of the twelfth century and whose methodical order foreshadows the great juridical syntheses of later centuries. Being compiled, however, for the most part not directly from the original canonical sources, but from immediately preceding collections, which in turn often depend on apocryphal productions of the ninth century, they appear tainted to the extent in which they make use of these forgeries. Such taint, however, affects the critical value of these collections rather than the legitimacy of the legislation which they exhibit. While the "False Decretals" affected certainly ecclesiastical discipline, it is now generally recognized that they did not introduce any essential or constitutional modifications. They gave a more explicit formulation to certain principles of the constitution of the Church, or brought more frequently into practice certain rules hitherto less recognized in daily use. As to the substance of this long development of disciplinary legislation, we may recognize with Paul Fournier a double current. The German collections, while not failing to admit the rights of the papal primacy, are seemingly concerned with the adaptation of the canons to actual needs of time and place; this is particularly visible in the collection of Burchard of Worms. The Italian collections, on the other hand, insist more on the rights of the papal primacy, and in general of the spiritual power. M. Fournier indicates, as especially influential in this sense, the Collection in Seventy-four Titles. Both tendencies meet and unite in the works of Yvo of Chartres. The compilations of this epoch may, therefore, be classed in these two broad categories. We do not, however, insist too strongly on these views, as yet somewhat provisory, and proceed to describe the principal collections of the next period, following, as a rule, the chronological order.

==End of the ninth century to Gratian (1139-50)==
In these two centuries the ecclesiastical authorities were quite active in their efforts to withstand the decay of Christian discipline; the evidence of this is seen in the frequency of councils, mixed assemblies of bishops and imperial officials and diocesan synods whose decrees (capitularies) were often published by the bishops. In this period many new collections of canons were made, some forty of which, as already said, are known to us.

===Collectio Anselmo Dedicata===

Its twelve books treat hierarchy, judgments, ecclesiastical persons, spiritual things (rules of faith, precepts, sacraments, liturgies) and persons separated from the Church. Its sources are the "Dionysiana", the "Hispana", the correspondence (Registrum) of Gregory I and various collections of civil laws. Unfortunately it has also drawn on Pseudo-Isidore.

It is dedicated to Anselm, doubtless [[Anselm II of Milan]] (833-97), and is held to have been compiled in Italy towards the end of the ninth century. It is certainly anterior to [[Burchard of Worms]] (1012–23), whose work depends on this collection. The author is unknown.

===Collection of Regino of Prüm===
[[Regino of Prüm]]'s work is entitled "De ecclesiasticis disciplinis et religione Christianâ" (on the discipline of the Church and the Christian religion). According to the preface it was put together by order of [[Radbod, Archbishop of Trier|Ratbod]], metropolitan of Trier, as a manual for episcopal use in the course of diocesan visitations.

Its two books treat of the clergy and ecclesiastical property viz. of the laity.
Each book begins with a list (''elenchus'') of questions that indicate the points of chief importance in the eyes of the bishop. After this catechism, it adds the canons and ecclesiastical authorities relative to each question.

The collection was made about 906 and seems to depend on an earlier one edited by Richter entitled "Antiqua Canonum collectio qua in libris de synodalibus causis compilandis usus est Regino Prumiensis" (Marburg, 1844).&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The text of Regino is found in ''Patrologia Latina'' CXXXII; a more critical edition is that of Wasserschleben, "Reginonis Abbatis Prum. libri duo de synodalibus causis" (Leipzig, 1840).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Capitula Abbonis"===
[[Abbo, Abbot of Fleury]] (died 1004), dedicated to [[Hugues Capet]] and his son [[Robert II of France|Robert Capet]] a collection in fifty-six chapters.

It deals with the clergy, ecclesiastical property, monks and their relations with the bishops. Besides the canons and papal decretals, Abbo made use of the Capitularies, the Roman civil law, and the laws of the Visigoths; his collection is peculiar in that he enclosed within his own context the texts quoted by him.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;This collection is found in the second volume of the "Vetera Analecta" of Mabillon (Paris, 1675-85), and is reprinted in ''Patrologia Latina'' CXXXI.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Collectarium Canonum" or "Libri decretorum" of Burchard of Worms===
This collection in twenty books, often called ''Brocardus'', was compiled by [[Burchard of Worms|Burchard]], an ecclesiastic of Mainz, later [[Bishop of Worms]] (1002–25), at the suggestion of Brunicho, [[Provost (religion)|provost]] of Worms, and with the aid of [[Walter of Speyer|Walter]], [[Bishop of Speyer]], and the monk Albert. Burchard follows quite closely the following order: hierarchy, liturgy, sacraments, delicts, sanctions and criminal procedure. The nineteenth book was familiarly known as ''Medicus'' or ''Corrector'', because it dealt with the spiritual ailments of different classes of the faithful; it has been edited by [[Wasserschleben]] in ''Bussordnungen der abendländischen Kirche'' (Leipzig, 1851). The twentieth, which treats of [[Divine Providence|Providence]], [[predestination]] and the end of the world, is therefore a theological treatise.
 
The collection, composed between 1013 and 1023 (perhaps in 1021 or 1022), is not a mere compilation, but a revision of the ecclesiastical law from the standpoint of actual needs, and an attempt to reconcile various juridical antinomies or contradictions. Burchard is a predecessor of [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] and, like the latter, was a very popular canonist in his time. He depends on the above-mentioned ninth-century collections and even added to their apocryphal documents and erroneous attributions. The two collections just described (''Regino'' and ''Collectio Anselmo dedicata'') were known and largely used by him. Pseudo-Isidore also furnished him more than 200 pieces. The entire collection is in ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', CXL.

===The "Collectio Duodecim Partium"===
Yet unedited, is by an unknown, probably German, author. It includes a great deal of Burchard, follows quite closely his order, and by most is held to have copied his material, though some believe it older than Burchard.

===The Collection in Seventy-four Books===
''The Collection in Seventy-four Books'', or "Diversorum sententia Patrum", known to the [[Ballerini brothers]] and [[Augustin Theiner]], is the subject of a study by [[Paul Fournier]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le premier manuel canonique de la réforme du onzième siècle'' in ''[[Mélanges de l'École française de Rome|Mélanges d'Archéologie et d'Histoire publiés par l'Ecole Française de Rome]]'', 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; He considers it a compilation of the middle of the eleventh century, done about the reign of [[St. Leo IX]] (1048–54), and in the entourage of that pope and [[Pope Gregory VII|Hildebrand]].

It was well known in and out of Italy and furnished to other collections not only their general order, but also much of their material. Fournier believes it the source of the collection of [[Anselm of Lucca]], of the ''Tarraconensis'' and the ''Polycarpus'', also of other collections specified by him.

===Collection of Anselm of Lucca===
This collection is divided into thirteen books. It is based on [[Burchard of Worms|Burchard]] and the "Collectio Anselmo dedicata" and contains many apocryphal pieces and papal decretals not found in other collections.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The Ballerini concluded that St. Anselm consulted directly the pontifical archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has no preface; from the beginning (''Incipit'') of a Vatican manuscript it is clear that [[Anselm of Lucca]] compiled the work during the pontificate and by order of [[Pope Gregory VII]] (died 1085). It passed almost entire into the [[Decretum of Gratian]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;A critical edition is owing to Fr. Thaner, who published the first four books under the title "Anselmi episcopi Lucensis collectio canonum una cum collectione minore Jussu Instituti Saviniani (Savigny) recensuit F. T." (Innsbruck, 1906).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection of Cardinal Deusdedit===
[[Deusdedit of San Pietro in Vincoli|Cardinal Deusdedit]] was enabled to use the correspondence (''Registrum'') of [[Pope Gregory VII]], also the Roman archives.

His work is dedicated to [[Pope Victor III]] (1086–87), the successor of Gregory, and dates therefore from the reign of Victor; its four books on the papal primacy, the Roman clergy, ecclesiastical property and the [[Patrimony of Peter]], reflect the contemporary anxieties of the papal entourage during this phase of the [[conflict of Investiture]] between the Church and the [[Holy Roman empire]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;We owe to [[Pio Martinucci]] (Venice, 1869) a very imperfect edition of this collection and to [[Wolf de Granvell]], professor at Gratz, a critical edition (''Die Kanonessammlung des Kardinals Deusdedit'', Paderborn, 1906).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection of Bonizo===
[[Bonizo, Bishop of Sutri]] near [[Piacenza]], published, apparently a little later than 1089, a collection in ten books preceded by a brief preface which treats successively the [[catechism]] and [[baptism]], then the duties of divers classes of the faithful: ecclesiastical rulers and inferior clergy, temporal authorities and their subjects, finally of the cure of souls and the penitential canons. The fourth book only (''De excellentiâ Ecclesiæ Romanæ'') has found an editor, [[Cardinal Mai]], in the seventh volume of his "Nova Bibliotheca Patrum" (Rome, 1854).

===The "Polycarpus"===
A collection in eight books so called by its author, [[Gregory, Cardinal of San Crisogono]] (q.v.), and dedicated to [[Diego Gelmírez]], [[Archbishop of Compostella]], of whose name only the initial "D." is given; also known as Didacus, he was archbishop of that see from 1101 to 1120, which is therefore the approximate date of the "Polycarpus" (now given as around 1113). It depends on [[Anselm of Lucca]] and on the "Collectio Anselmo dedicata", and the above-mentioned "Collection in Seventy-four Books"; the author, however, must have had access to the Roman archives.

===Collection of Yvo of Chartres===
[[Yvo of Chartres]] exercised a pronounced influence on the development of canon law (he died 1115 or 1117). We owe to Paul Fournier a study of his juridical activity.&lt;ref&gt;"Les collections canoniques attribuées à Yves de Chartres", Paris, 1897 and "Yves de Chartres et le droit canonique" in "Revue des questions historiques", 1898, LXII, 51, 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has left us: 
# The "Decretum", a vast repertory in seventeen parts and three thousand seven hundred and sixty chapters; though roughly subdivided under the aforesaid seventeen rubrics, its contents are thrown together without order and seemingly represent undigested results of the author's studies and researches; hence it has been surmised that the "Decretum" is a mere preparatory outline of the "Panormia" (see below), its material in the rough. Theiner does not admit that the "Decretum" is the work of Yvo; it is, nevertheless, generally accepted that Yvo is the author, or at least that he directed the compilation. Nearly all of Burchard is found therein, and in addition a host of canonical texts, also Roman and Frankish law texts gathered from Italian sources. Fournier dates it between 1090 and 1095. It is found in ''Patrologia Latina'' CLXI.
# The "Panormia", admittedly a work of Yvo. It is much shorter than the "Decretum" (having only eight books) and is also more compact and orderly. Its material is taken from the Decretum, but it offers some additions, particularly in the third and fourth books. It seems to have been composed about 1095, and appears at that time as a kind of methodical Summa of the canon law; with Burchard it divided popularity in the next fifty years, i. e. until the appearance of the "Decretum" of Gratian.
#The "Tripartita", so called because of its triple division, contains in its first part papal decretals as late as [[Urban II]] (died 1099), and is therefore not of later date; its second part offers canons of the councils after the "Hispana" text; the third part contains extracts from the Fathers and from the Roman - and the Frankish law.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Hitherto it was supposed to have been taken from the "Decretum" of Yvo or composed by some unknown author. Fournier, however, thinks that only the third book postdates the "Decretum", and then as an abridgment (A). The other two books he considers a trial-essay of the "Decretum", by Yvo himself or by some writer who worked under his direction while he laboured at the vast bulk of the "Decretum". These two books, according to Fournier, formed a separate collection (A) later on joined to the above-mentioned third book (B), in which manner arose the actual "Tripartita". In this hypothesis many chapters in the "Decretum" were borrowed from the aforementioned (A) collection, whose nucleus is found in its extracts from Pseudo-Isidore completed from divers other sources, especially by use of a collection of Italian origin, now kept in the British Museum. hence known as the "Britannica". The "Tripartita" is yet unedited.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diverse collections===
All three of these above-described collections (Decretum, Panormia, Tripartita) called for and found abridgements. Moreover, new collections arose, owing to fresh additions to these major compilations and new combinations with other similar works. Among them are: 
# The "Cæsaraugustana", so called because found in a Spanish [[Carthusian]] monastery near [[Zaragoza]]. It seems to have been compiled in [[Aquitaine]] and contains no papal decretals later than [[Paschal II]] (died 1118), which suggests its composition at a previous date. Its fifteen books borrow much from the "Decretum" of Yvo of Chartres.
# The "Collection in Ten Parts", compiled in France between 1125 and 1130, an enlarged edition of the "Panormia".
# The "Summa-Decretorum" of Haymo, [[Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne]] (1153), an abridgment of the preceding.
#[[Antonius Augustinus]], who made known in the sixteenth century the "Cæsaraugustana", revealed also the existence of the "Tarraconensis", which came to him from the Spanish [[Cistercian]] monastery of [[Ploblete]], near [[Tarragona]] in six books. It has no documents later than the reign of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] (died 1085) and belongs therefore to the end of the eleventh century; the "[[Correctores Romani]]", to whom we owe (1572–85) the official edition of the "[[Corpus Juris canonici]]", made use of the "Tarraconensis".&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Fournier called attention to two manuscripts of this collection, one in the Vatican, the other in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] at Paris (see above, the Collection in Seventy-four Books).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34393">{{main article|State governments of the United States}}

In the [[United States]], the [[government]] of each of the 50 [[U.S. state|states]] is structured in accordance with its individual [[State constitution (United States)|constitution]]. In turn, each state constitution must be grounded in [[Republicanism in the United States|republican principles]]. [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Republican government|Article IV, Section 4, Clause 1]] of the [[United States Constitution]] tasks the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] with assuring that each state’s government is so organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Natelson|first1=Robert G.|title=Essays on Article IV: Guarantee Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/4/essays/128/guarantee-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All state governments are modeled after the federal government and consist of three branches (although the three-branch structure is not Constitutionally required): [[Governor (United States)|executive]], [[State legislature (United States)|legislative]], and [[State court (United States)|judicial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/state-and-local-government|title=State &amp; Local Government|website=whitehouse.gov|publisher=[[The White House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/faq/faqtoc.aspx?subject=1|title=Frequently Asked Questions About the Minnesota Legislature|publisher=[[Minnesota State Legislature]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; All state governments are also organized as [[presidential system]]s where the governor is both [[head of government]] and [[head of state]] (even though this too is not required). The government of each of the five permanently inhabited [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] is modeled and organized in a like fashion. 

Each state is itself a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] entity, and as such, reserves the right to organize in any way (within the above stated parameter) deemed appropriate by its people. As a result, while the governments of the various states share many similar features, they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance. No two state governments are identical. The following tables compare and contrast some of the features of U.S. state, and territorial governments, and also the government of the [[District of Columbia]], its [[capital city]].

==Legislative==
{{See also|List of United States state legislatures|l1=Political composition of state legislatures|United States state legislatures' partisan trend|l2=Historical trend of state legislature political composition}}

With the exception of [[Nebraska]], all American state legislatures are [[bicameral]], meaning there is one legislative body separated into two units. Nebraska eliminated its lower house with a referendum during the 1936 elections. Also, some systems, such as [[New York (state)|New York]]'s, have two legislative bodies while never technically referring to them in the state constitution as a single body. These dual systems are generally considered bicameral.

The following table compares common legislative features of each state, the District of Columbia and the five U.S. territories.

&lt;!-- Do not add political composition of state legislatures to this table. That table is located at "List of United States state legislatures" which is linked. --&gt;

=== Supermajority requirements ===
While only 13 states have a [[filibuster]], there are often restrictions on the majority a state needs to raise taxes.

|The Alabama State Senate allows a filibuster, and has a general three-fifths requirement to enact [[cloture]].

|Arkansas
|Arkansas, along with Rhode Island, is one of the only states that requires a supermajority to pass a budget. A three-fourths majority is required for appropriations, except for education, highways, and paying down the state debt, which require a simple majority.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/budget/supermajority-vote-requirements-to-pass-the-budget.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[California]]
|From 1933-2011 there was a two-thirds requirement for general fund appropriations for purposes other than public schools (Const., Art. IV, Sec. 12). Because the Legislature typically passes one main budget bill, the requirement effectively applied to the whole budget bill.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/budget/supermajority-vote-requirements-to-pass-the-budget.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a two-thirds requirement for tax increases since [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13 in 1978]]. In [[California elections, 2010#Proposition_25|2010, voters approved Proposition 25]], eliminating the 2/3 requirement for the budget, but keeping it for tax increases.

{{See also|Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits|l1=Gubernatorial term limits}}
The [[Governor (United States)|Governor]] is the chief executive official in all states. D.C. has a mayor which serves executive functions in the District, although constitutionally it is controlled by Congress.

&lt;!-- The table does not distinguish (right now) whether or not the term limits are for total terms, or consecutive terms. This, in addition to other quirks in term limit laws, should be noted succinctly in the appropriate field. --&gt;

[[File:DMZ1.jpg|250px|thumb|alt=Map of the demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam|The [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]] separated [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]].]]
A '''demilitarized zone''', '''DMZ''' or '''DZ'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oren|first1=Michael|title=Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East|date=June 3, 2003|publisher=Presidio Press|isbn=978-0345461926|page=7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is an area in which treaties or agreements between nations, military powers or contending groups forbid military installations, activities or personnel. A DMZ often lies along an established frontier or boundary between two or more military powers or alliances. A DMZ may sometimes form a ''de facto'' international border, such as the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|38th parallel between North and South Korea]]. Other examples of demilitarized zones are a {{convert|120|mi|adj=on}} wide [[Iraq-Kuwait barrier|area between Iraq and Kuwait]], [[Politics of Antarctica|Antarctica]] (preserved for scientific exploration and study) and [[Politics of outer space|outer space]] (space more than {{convert|100|mi}} from the earth's surface).

Many demilitarized zones are considered [[neutral territory]] because neither side is allowed to control it, even for non-combat administration. Some zones remain demilitarized after an agreement has awarded control to a state which (under the DMZ terms) had originally ceded its right to maintain military forces in the disputed territory. It is also possible for powers to agree on the demilitarization of a zone without formally settling their respective territorial claims, enabling the dispute to be resolved by peaceful means such as diplomatic dialogue or an international court.

Several demilitarized zones have also unintentionally become [[wildlife preserve]]s because their land is unsafe for construction or less exposed to human disturbances (including hunting). Examples include the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]], the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]], and the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|Green Line in Cyprus]].

=={{anchor|Current demilitarized (mostly neutral) zones}}Current demilitarized zones==

* [[Aegean Islands]]&amp;nbsp;– The [[Greece|Greek]] islands of [[Chios]], [[Icaria]], [[Lesbos]], and [[Samos]] are partially demilitarized according to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. The Treaty forbids all naval fortifications and bases and stipulates that military forces on the islands "be limited to the normal contingent called up for military service."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |work=[[Treaty of Lausanne]] |title=art. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Åland Islands]]&amp;nbsp;– The [[Åland convention| Åland Convention of 1921]], which was concluded following a decision of the [[League of Nations]] in response to the [[Åland crisis]], mandates that the [[Finland|Finnish]] government maintain the territory as a demilitarized area.
* [[Antarctica]]&amp;nbsp;– The [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] forbids military activity in Antarctica, such as "the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military manoeuvres, as well as the testing of any type of weapon". The Treaty does however provide for the "use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |work=[[Antarctic Treaty]] |year=1959 |title=art. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ceuta border fence]] and [[Melilla border fence]]&amp;nbsp;– A ''de facto'' demilitarized zone exists between the Spanish territories of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and [[Morocco]]. Perimeter fences around both cities have been constructed by Spanish and Moroccan authorities, creating a demilitarized zone between the Spanish and Moroccan fences.
* [[Dniester Valley Security Zone]]&amp;nbsp;– Created by the cease-fire agreement ending the [[War of Transnistria]], the [[Joint Control Commission]] peacekeeping mission monitors a demilitarized zone roughly outlining the [[Dnister]] between [[Moldova]] and [[Transnistria]].
* [[Ground Safety Zone]]&amp;nbsp;– A {{convert|5|km|adj=on|abbr=on}}-wide demilitarized area between [[Serbia]] and [[Kosovo]] was created under the [[Kumanovo Agreement]] following the [[Kosovo War]].
* [[Idlib]]&amp;nbsp;- A {{convert|15|km|adj=on|abbr=on}} demilitarized zone, Created by agreement between Russian and Turkish government, splitting the last major stronghold of the Syrian rebels from the Syrian government controlled area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-turkey-russia-syria-20180917-story,amp.html |title=Turkey, Russia agree on demilitarized zone in Syria's Idlib region |first=Jim |last=Heintz |date=17 September 2018 |access-date=9 October 2018 |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181008203352/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-turkey-russia-syria-20180917-story,amp.html |archive-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]&amp;nbsp;– The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] created a 4&amp;nbsp;km (2.5&amp;nbsp;mi)-wide demilitarized zone between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] following the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |work=[[Korean Armistice Agreement]] |year=1953 |title=art. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently the most heavily guarded area in the world.{{cn|date=December 2018}}
* [[Kuwait–Iraq barrier]]&amp;nbsp;– The [[United Nations Security Council]] approved the creation of a demilitarized zone between [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]] in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 689|Resolution 689]]. Although the demilitarized zone is no longer mandated by the Council, it continues to exist.
* [[Preah Vihear Temple]]&amp;nbsp;– The [[International Court of Justice]] had ordered the creation of a "provisional demilitarized zone" around the Temple whose ownership [[Cambodian–Thai border dispute|is claimed]] by both [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/16564.pdf |title=Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (''Cambodia v.

* [[Sinai Peninsula]]&amp;nbsp;– The [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] sets a limit to the amount of forces [[Egypt]] can place in the Sinai Peninsula. Parts of the peninsula are demilitarized to various degrees, especially within {{convert|20|-|40|km|abbr=off}} of [[Israel]]. Israel also agreed to limit its forces within {{convert|3|km|abbr=off}} of the Egyptian border. The areas are monitored by the [[Multinational Force and Observers]].

==Former demilitarized zones==
[[File:Gibraltar map.png|thumb|right|alt=Old map of the Gibraltar peninsula|Historical map of the [[promontory]] of Gibraltar.]]
* A neutral territory was established between the British territory of [[Gibraltar]] and Spain after the end of the [[Thirteenth Siege of Gibraltar|1727 siege]]. A strip of land 600 [[toise]]s (about {{convert|1.2|km}}) long,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} more than two cannon shots' distance between the British and Spanish guns, was called "the neutral ground" and shown as such on older maps. In 1908, the British built a fence in a portion claimed to be the British half of the neutral territory. Spain [[Disputed status of the isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain|does not recognize]] British sovereignty over the isthmus (including the border), asserting it is Spanish soil. Although both the United Kingdom and Spain are part of the [[European Union]], the border is now a ''[[de facto]]'' international frontier with customs and immigration checks; Spain does not formally recognize it as a "frontier", referring to it as a "fence". Whatever its name, Gibraltar opted out of the [[European Union Customs Union]] and is not part of the [[Schengen Area]]; the border is open 24 hours a day, with [[customs]] duties payable on designated goods entering Spain or Gibraltar.
*The German [[Rhineland]] was made a demilitarized zone after World War I by the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]. It was [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|re-occupied and re-militarized]] in 1936 by [[Nazi Germany]], in violation of international treaties.

*China: Japanese forces conquered [[Manchuria]] between September 1931 and February 1932, when they proclaimed the region the state of [[Manchukuo]]. In May 1933, the [[Tanggu Truce]] between China and Japan was concluded, establishing a demilitarized zone between Manchukuo and China. In 1945, after the fall of the Japanese empire, Manchuria was re-incorporated into China.
*[[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Vietnam]]: The demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam was established in April 1954 as a result of the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] ending the war between the [[Viet Minh]] and the French. The DMZ in Vietnam officially lay at the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]]; in reality, it extended about a mile on either side of the [[Bến Hải River]] and west to east from the [[Laos|Lao]] border to the [[South China Sea]].
*Norway and Sweden established a demilitarized zone of 1 km on each side of their border after the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]] in 1905. The zone was abolished by mutual agreement in 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1887">The '''European Convention on the International Classification of Patents for Invention''' was signed on December 19, 1954, in [[Paris]], [[France]], by members of the [[Council of Europe]]. It entered into force on August 1, 1955, and it was denounced by all Parties and ceased to be in force as from February 18, 1999.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}
'''Evidence-based policy''' ('''EBP''') is a term often applied in multiple fields of [[public policy]] to refer to situations whereby policy decisions are informed by rigorously established objective [[evidence]].  Underlying many of the calls for 'evidence based policy' is often a (stated or unstated) concern with fidelity to scientific good practice, reflecting the belief that social goals are best served when [[scientific evidence]] is used rigorously and comprehensively to inform decisions, rather than in a piecemeal, manipulated, or cherry-picked manner. 

Conceptually the term has been seen as an extension of the [[Scientific method]] or [[evidence-based medicine]] to all areas of public policy. 

Some have promoted particular types of evidence as 'best' for policy makers to consider, including scientifically rigorous evaluation studies such as [[randomized controlled trial]]s to identify programs and practices capable of improving policy-relevant outcomes. However, some areas of policy-relevant knowledge are not well served by quantitative research, leading to debate about the methods and instruments that are considered critical for the collection of relevant evidence. For instance, policies that are concerned with human rights, public acceptability, or social justice may require other evidence than what randomized trials provide, or may require moral philosophical reasoning in addition to considerations of evidence of intervention effect (which randomised trials are principally designed to provide &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech.57.7.527 |pmid=12821702 |pmc=1732497 |title=Evidence, hierarchies, and typologies: Horses for courses |journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health |volume=57 |issue=7 |pages=527–9 |year=2003 |last1=Petticrew |first1=M }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Good data, analytical skills and political support to the use of scientific information, as such, are typically seen as the important elements of an evidence-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;Head, Brian. (2009). [http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/96208/03-chapter2.pdf Evidence-based policy: principles and requirements]. [[University of Queensland]]. Retrieved 4 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although evidence-based policy can be traced as far back as the fourteenth century, it was more recently popularized by the [[Blair Government]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="pc.gov.au"&gt;Banks, Gary (2009). [http://www.pc.gov.au/speeches/cs20090204 Evidence-based policy making: What is it? How do we get it?]. Australian Government, [[Productivity Commission]]. Retrieved 4 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Blair Government said they wanted to end the ideological led-based decision making for policy making.&lt;ref name="pc.gov.au"/&gt; For example, a UK Government white paper published in 1999 (''"Modernising Government"'') noted that Government must "produce policies that really deal with problems, that are forward-looking and shaped by evidence rather than a response to short-term pressures; that tackle causes not symptoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Evidence-based policy is associated with [[AFM Smith|Adrian Smith]] because in his 1996 presidential address to the [[Royal Statistical Society]], Smith questioned the current process of policy making and urged for a more “evidence-based approach” commenting that it has “valuable lessons to offer”.&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, Ashby, Young (2002). [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/content/1/c6/03/45/85/wp2.pdf Systematic Reviews: What have they got to offer evidence based policy and practice?] ESRC UK Centre for Evidence Based Policy and Practice. Retrieved 7th May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Some policy scholars now avoid using the term 'evidence based' policy, using others such as 'evidence informed'. This language shift allows continued thinking about the underlying desire to ''improve'' evidence use in terms of its rigor or quality, while avoiding some of the key limitations or reductionist ideas at times seen with the 'evidence based' language. Still, the language of 'evidence based' policy is widely used and, as such, can be interpreted to reflect a desire for evidence to be used well or appropriately in one way or another - such as by ensuring systematic consideration of rigorous and high quality policy relevant evidence, or by avoiding biased and erroneous applications of evidence for political ends.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkhurst|first1=Justin|title=The Politics of Evidence: from Evidence Based Policy to the Good Governance of Evidence|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9781138939400|url=http://www.tandfebooks.com/action/showBook?doi=10.4324/9781315675008|doi=10.4324/9781315675008}}{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of evidence-based policy==

The earliest form of evidence-based policy was tariff-making in Australia which was required under legislation to be educated by the public report issued by the Tariff Board. These reports were initially only reporting on the impacts but changed to also report on the effects of industries and the economy.&lt;ref name="pc.gov.au"/&gt;

Many scholars see the term "evidence-based policy" as evolving from "evidence-based medicine", in which research findings are used as the support for clinical decisions  and evidence is gathered by randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which is comparing a treatment group with a placebo group to measure results.&lt;ref name="arpa.econ.usyd.edu.au"&gt;Marston &amp; Watts. [http://arpa.econ.usyd.edu.au/journal/v3/n3/marston_watts.pdf Tampering with the Evidence: A Critical Appraisal of Evidence-Based Policy-Making]. RMIT University. Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the Cochrane Collaboration was established in the UK, and works to keep all RCTs up-to-date and provides "Cochrane reviews" which provides primary research in human health and health policy.&lt;ref name="arpa.econ.usyd.edu.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cochrane.org/ The Cochrane Collaboration] Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There was then an increase in research and policy activists pushing for more evidence-based policy-making which led to the formation of the sister organization to Cochrane Collaboration, the [[Campbell Collaboration]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="arpa.econ.usyd.edu.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/ The Campbell Collaboration] Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Campbell Collaboration conducts reviews on the best evidence that analyzes the effects of social and educational policies and practices.

The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) became involved in the push for more evidence-based policy making with its 1.3 million pound grant to the Evidence Network in 1999. The Evidence Network is a center for evidence-based policy and practice and is similar to both the Campbell and Cochrane Collaboration.&lt;ref name="arpa.econ.usyd.edu.au"/&gt;

More recently the [http://www.alliance4usefulevidence.org Alliance for Useful Evidence] has been established, with funding from ESRC, Big Lottery and Nesta, to champion the use of evidence in social policy and practice. The Alliance is a UK-wide network that promotes the use of high quality evidence to inform decisions on strategy, policy and practice through advocacy, publishing research, sharing ideas and advice, and holding events and training.

Recently questions have been raised about the conflicts-of-interest inherent to evidence-based decision-making used in public policy development.  In a study of vocational education in prisons operated by the California Department of Corrections, Andrew J. Dick, William Rich, and Tony Waters found that political considerations inevitably intruded into “evidence-based decisions” which were ostensibly technocratic in nature.  They point out that this is particularly where evidence is paid for by policy makers who have a vested interest in having past political judgments confirmed, evidence based research is likely to be corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 11-40 and 281-306 in "Prison Vocational Education and Policy in the United States" by Andrew J. Dick, William RIch, and Tony Waters. New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The methodology of evidence-based policy==

There are many methodologies for evidence-based policy but they all share the following characteristics:
*Tests a theory as to why the policy will be effective and what the impacts of the policy will be if it is successful
*Includes a counterfactual: what would have occurred if the policy had not been implemented
*Incorporates some measurement of the impact
*Examines both direct and indirect effects that occur because of the policy
*Separates the uncertainties and controls for other influences outside of the policy that may have an effect on the outcome
*Should be able to be tested and  replicated by a third party

The form of methodology used with evidence-based policy fit under the category of a cost-benefit framework and are created to estimate a net payoff if the policy was to be implemented. Because there is a difficulty in quantifying some effects and outcomes of the policy, it is mostly focused broadly on whether or not benefits will outweigh costs, instead of using specific values.&lt;ref name="pc.gov.au"/&gt;

==Critiques of evidence-based policy==

Several critiques have emerged. Paul Cairney, professor of politics and public policy at the [[University of Stirling]] in Scotland, argues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/946724638|title=The politics of evidence-based policy making|last=1973-|first=Cairney, Paul,|isbn=9781137517814|location=New York|oclc=946724638}}&lt;/ref&gt; that supporters of the idea underestimate the complexity of policy-making and misconstrue the way that policy decisions are usually made. Moreover, evidence has emerged&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apolitical.co/solution_article/government-numbers-data-damaging-public-services/|title=Government by numbers: how data is damaging our public services {{!}} Apolitical|work=Apolitical|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; of front-line public servants, like hospital managers, making decisions that actually worsen patients' care in order to hit pre-ordained targets. This argument was put forward by Professor Jerry Muller of the [[Catholic University of America]] in a book called The Tyranny of Metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1005121833|title=The tyranny of metrics|last=1954-|first=Muller, Jerry Z.,|isbn=9780691174952|location=Princeton|oclc=1005121833}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of critiques, including the fact that policies shown to be successful in one place often fail in others, despite reaching a gold standard of evidence, has been compiled by the policy platform Apolitical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apolitical.co/solution_article/evidence-based-policymaking-is-there-room-for-science-in-politics/|title=Evidence-based policymaking: is there room for science in politics? {{!}} Apolitical|work=Apolitical|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Evidence-based development policy==
The [[Overseas Development Institute]] has pioneered RAPID Outcome Mapping Approach (ROMA) over the past five years as a means to help aid donors and partners better transform research into policy initiatives.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Young, John and Mendizabal, Enrique  (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1127&amp;title=become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs: How to develop engagement strategies for evidence-based policy-making] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806061940/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1127&amp;title=become-policy-entrepreneur-roma |date=6 August 2010 }} London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is supported by other research within the development community. For instance, in a literature review focused on development, an integrated, participatory, structured and empowering approach to using evidence and data in decision-making to inform development decisions was tied to improved results. &lt;ref&gt;[https://usaidlearninglab.org//lab-notes/cracking-evidence-conundrum-four-ideas-get-people-use-evidence "Cracking the Evidence Conundrum: Four Ideas to Get People to Use Evidence"] (18 December 2017). USAID Learning Lab. Retrieved 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key lessons of evidence-based policy-making===
Six key lessons have been developed, which are:

# Policy processes are complex and rarely linear or logical and simply presenting information to policy-makers and expecting them to act upon it is very unlikely to work. Policy processes are not purely linear as they have various stages that each take varying lengths of time to complete and may in fact be conducted simultaneously. Strategies must be fluid.
# Policy is often only weakly informed by research-based evidence due to information gaps, secrecy, the need for speedy responses, political expediency and the fact that policy makers are rarely scientists.
#  Research-based evidence can contribute to policies that have a dramatic impact on lives. Success stories quoted in the UK's Department for International Development's (DFID) new research strategy include a 22% reduction in neonatal mortality in Ghana as a result of helping women begin breastfeeding within one hour of giving birth, and a 43% reduction in deaths among HIV positive children using a widely available antibiotic.
#  The need for a holistic understanding of the context in which the policy is to be implemented.
#  [[Policy entrepreneur]]s need additional skills to influence policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a037081 |title=Policy Entrepreneurs: Their Activity Structure and Function in the Policy Process |journal=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They need to be political fixers, able to understand the politics and identify the key players. They need to be good storytellers, able to synthesise simple compelling stories from the results of the research. They need to be good networkers to work effectively with all the other stakeholders, and they need to be good engineers, building a programme that pulls all of this together.
#  Policy entrepreneurs need clear intent – they need to really want to do it. Turning a researcher into a policy entrepreneur, or a research institute or department into a policy-focused think tank involves a fundamental re-orientation towards policy engagement rather than academic achievement; engaging much more with the policy community; developing a research agenda focusing on policy issues rather than academic interests; acquiring new skills or building multidisciplinary teams; establishing new internal systems and incentives; spending much more on communications; producing a different range of outputs; and working more in partnerships and networks.

These lessons show that the relationship between research, policy and practice is complex, multi-factoral, non-linear, and highly context specific.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; What works in one situation may not work in another. Developing effective strategies in complex environments is not straightforward. Simple tools such as cost–benefit analysis, logical frameworks, traditional project management tools and others may not work on their own, as they fail to take into account the existing complexity.

Based on research conducted in six Asian and African countries, the Future Health Systems consortium has identified a set of key strategies for improving uptake of evidence in to policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1478-4505-6-4 |title=Exploring evidence-policy linkages in health research plans: A case study from six countries |journal=Health Research Policy and Systems |volume=6 |year=2008 |last1=Syed |first1=Shamsuzzoha B |last2=Hyder |first2=Adnan A |last3=Bloom |first3=Gerald |last4=Sundaram |first4=Sandhya |last5=Bhuiya |first5=Abbas |last6=Zhenzhong |first6=Zhang |last7=Kanjilal |first7=Barun |last8=Oladepo |first8=Oladimeji |last9=Pariyo |first9=George |last10=Peters |first10=David H }}&lt;/ref&gt; including: improving the technical capacity of policy-makers; better packaging of research findings; use of social networks; establishment of fora to assist in linking evidence with policy outcomes.&lt;ref name="National Policy-Makers Speak"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyder|first=A|title=National Policy-Makers Speak Out: Are Researchers Giving Them What They Need?|journal=Health Policy and Planning|date=14 June 2010|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/national-policy-makers-speak-out-are-researchers-giving-them.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2009.12.006 |pmid=20227095 |title=Stakeholder analysis for health research: Case studies from low- and middle-income countries |journal=Public Health |volume=124 |issue=3 |pages=159–66 |year=2010 |last1=Hyder |first1=A |last2=Syed |first2=S |last3=Puvanachandra |first3=P |last4=Bloom |first4=G |last5=Sundaram |first5=S |last6=Mahmood |first6=S |last7=Iqbal |first7=M |last8=Hongwen |first8=Z |last9=Ravichandran |first9=N |last10=Oladepo |first10=O |last11=Pariyo |first11=G |last12=Peters |first12=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RAPID Outcome Mapping Approach===
ROMA approach takes these lessons into account has been field tested through more than 40 workshops and training courses worldwide. It is an eight-step approach for each of which the ODI has developed resources and policy tools to ensure each step is comprehensively addressed:

#  Define a clear, overarching policy objective.
#  Map the policy context around that issue and identify the key factors that may influence the policy process. The RAPID framework provides a useful checklist of questions.
#  Identify the key influential stakeholders. RAPID’s Alignment, Interest and Influence Matrix (AIIM) can be used to map actors along three dimensions: the degree of alignment (i.e. agreement) with the proposed policy, their level of interest in the issue, and their ability to exert influence on the policy process.
#  Develop a [[theory of change]] - identify the changes needed among them if they are to support the desired policy outcome.
#  Develop a strategy to achieve the milestone changes in the process - Force Field Analysis is a flexible tool that can be used to further understand the forces supporting and opposing the desired policy change and suggest concrete responses.
#  Ensure the engagement team has the competencies required to operationalise the strategy.
#  Establish an action plan for meeting the desired policy objective - useful tools include the RAPID Information matrix, DFID’s log frame and IDRC’s Outcome Mapping Strategy Map among them.
#  Develop a monitoring and learning system, not only to track progress, make any necessary adjustments and assess the effectiveness of the approach, but also to learn lessons for the future.

An example of ROMA approach can be seen in the case of the Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System (WEMS) Initiative &lt;ref&gt;World Wildlife Day (3 March 2014). [http://wems-initiative.org/ Evidence Based Policy-Making in Addressing Wildlife Crime]. Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System Initiative. Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; where a systematic approach of agreement has brought its implementation in Africa.

===Results===
This has resulted in:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

#  Over 50 case studies on successful evidence-based policy engagement have been compiled, a network
#  Development and facilitation of the evidence-based policy in Development Network (ebpdn), which links more than 20 institutional partners and thousands of practitioners working on evidence-based policy processes.
#  Creating an array of practical toolkits designed with [[civil society organisation]]s, researchers and progressive policy makers in mind. For example, at the recent Tokyo Conference on Combating Wildlife crime, [[United Nations University]] and [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] presented the first case of evidence based policy making maps on enforcement and compliance of CITES convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestrygis.com/wems/index.html Evidence Based Policy-Making in Addressing Wildlife Crime]. United Nations University. Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
#  Direct support to civil society organisations (CSOs) to provide training in policy influencing and strategic communication.
# Strengthening the capacity for the UK [[Department for International Development]] (DFID) to influence other actors.

==The Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy==

The Coalition is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, whose mission is to increase government effectiveness through the use of rigorous evidence about “what works.” Since 2001, the Coalition's work with U.S. Congressional and Executive Branch officials has advanced evidence-based reforms in U.S. social programs, which have been enacted into law and policy. The Coalition has no affiliation with any programs or program models, and no financial interest in the policy ideas it supports, enabling it to serve as an independent, objective source of expertise to government officials on evidence-based policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coalition4evidence.org The Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy].

An '''expatriate''' (often shortened to '''expat''') is a person temporarily or permanently [[Residency (domicile)|residing]] in a country other than their native country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/expatriate|title=expatriate {{!}} Definition of expatriate in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common usage, the term often refers to professionals, skilled workers, or artists taking positions outside their home country, either independently or sent abroad by their employers, who can be companies, universities, governments, or [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castree|first=Noel|title=A Dictionary of Human Geography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=|isbn=9780199599868|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYWcAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780199599868&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI1c2r4_OrxwIVh4uSCh1ilgAc#v=onepage&amp;q=expatriate&amp;f=false| edition=1|author2=Rob Kitchen |author3=Alisdair Rogers }}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively migrant workers, they usually earn more than they would at home, and more than local employees. However, the term 'expatriate' is also used for retirees and others who have chosen to live outside their native country. Historically, it has also referred to [[exile]]s.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/expatriate |title=Definition of expatriate in English |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''expatriate'' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] terms ''[[wikt:ex#Latin|ex]]'' ("out of") and ''[[wikt:patria#Latin|patria]]'' ("native country, fatherland"). Dictionary definitions for the current meaning of the word include:

:'''Expatriate''':
:* 'A person who lives outside their native country' (Oxford),&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; or
:* 'living in a foreign land' (Webster's).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/expatriate |title=Definition of expatriate |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Merriam-Webster |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These contrast with definitions of other words with a similar meaning, such as:
:'''[[Migrant (disambiguation)|Migrant]]''':
:* 'A person who moves from one place to another in order to find work or better living conditions' (Oxford),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/migrant |title=Definition of migrant in English: |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
:* 'one that migrates: such as '''a:''' a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops' (Webster's);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/migrant |title=Definition of migrant |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Merriam-Webster |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::::::'''or'''
:'''[[Immigrant]]'''
:* 'A person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country' (Oxford),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/immigrant |title= Definition of immigrant in English |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
:* 'one that immigrates: such as '''a:''' a person who comes to a country to take up permanent residence (Webster's).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigrant |title=Definition of immigrant |date=2017 |website=Merriam-Webster |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The varying use of these terms for different groups of foreigners can thus be seen as implying nuances about wealth, intended length of stay, perceived motives for moving, nationality, and even race. This has caused controversy, with many asserting that the traditional use of the word has had racist connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/mar/13/white-people-expats-immigrants-migration |title= Why are white people expats when the rest of us are immigrants? |last=Koutonin |first=Mawuna Remarque |date=13 March 2015 |website=The Guardian |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |access-date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2014/12/29/in-hong-kong-just-who-is-an-expat-anyway/ |title=In Hong Kong, Just Who Is an Expat, Anyway? |last=DeWolf |first=Christopher |date=29 December 2014 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[News Corp]] |access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2015/04/02/expat-under-fire-a-global-nomad-argues-against-those-saying-its-racist/ |last=Tulshyan |first=Ruchika |title=‘Expat’ Under Fire: The Word Is Not Racist, Argues A Global Nomad (subscription required) |date=2 April 2015 |website=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=[[News Corp]] |access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ozy.com/immodest-proposal/lets-kill-off-expat/62611 |title=Let’s Kill off Expat |last= Secorun Palet |first= Laura |date=13 November 2015 |website=[[OZY]] |access-date=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/bigger-picture/migrants-are-migrants-c11e5d3b47c9 |title=Migrants Are Migrants |last= Briggs |first= Emma |date=9 July 2018 |website=The Bigger Picture |publisher=[[Medium_(website)]] |access-date=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.waywordradio.org/is-expat-racist/ |title=Is “Expat” Racist? |last= Briggs |first= Emma |date=30 January 2017 |website=A Way with Words |publisher=Wayword, Inc. |access-date=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a British national working in Spain or Portugal is commonly referred to as an 'expatriate', whereas a Spanish or Portuguese national working in Britain is referred to as an 'immigrant', thus indicating [[Anglocentrism]].

An older usage of the word ''expatriate'' was to refer to an [[exile]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; Alternatively, when used as a verb, ''expatriation'' can mean the act of someone [[Renunciation of citizenship|renouncing allegiance]] to their native country, as in the preamble to the United States [[Expatriation Act of 1868]] which says, 'the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Revised Statutes]], Sec. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[neologism]]s have been coined, including:
*''flexpatriate'', an employee who often travels internationally for business (see below);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=flexpatriate |title=Definition of flexpatriate |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Financial Times: lexicon |publisher=The Nikkei |access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[wikt:inpatriate|inpatriate]]'', an employee sent from a foreign subsidiary to work in the country where a business is headquartered;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.iese.edu/expatriatus/2014/01/22/inpatriates-on-the-term-and-academic-findings/ |title=Inpatriates: On the Term and Academic Findings |last=Reiche |first=Sebastian |date=22 January 2014 |website=IESE Business School  |publisher=[[University of Navarra]] |access-date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''rex-pat'', a repeat expatriate, often someone who has chosen to return to a foreign country after completing a work assignment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rex-patriate games: Film takes humorous look at moving – and staying – abroad |last=Drew |first=Kevin |date=5 October 2004 |website=CNN |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/05/rexpatriates/ |access-date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since [[Ancient history|antiquity]], people have gone to live in foreign countries, whether as [[diplomats]], [[merchants]] or [[missionaries]]. The numbers of such travellers grew markedly after the 15th century with the dawn of the [[History of colonialism|European colonial period]].

===Types of expat community===

In the 19th century, travel became easier by way of [[steamship]] or [[Steam locomotive|train]]. People could more readily choose to live for several years in a foreign country, or be sent there by employers. The table below aims to show significant examples of expatriate communities which have developed since that time:

During the 1930s, [[Nazi Germany]] revoked the citizenship of many opponents, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Oskar Maria Graf]], [[Willy Brandt]] and [[Thomas Mann]], often expatriating entire families.&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Grundmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3D8fJeqIUjIC&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;ots=K-ietMUgvJ&amp;dq=einstein%20expatriated&amp;pg=PA294#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Einstein Dossiers: Science and Politics—Einstein's Berlin Period''], Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer Verlag (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;294.

After World War II, [[decolonization|decolonisation]] accelerated. However, lifestyles which had developed among European colonials continued to some degree in expatriate communities. Remnants of the old British Empire, for example, can still be seen in the form of [[gated communities]] staffed by [[domestic workers]]. Social clubs which have survived include the [[Hash House Harriers]] and the [[Royal Selangor Club|Royal Selangor]]. Homesick palates are catered for by [[expatriate delicatessen|specialist food shops]], and drinkers can still order a [[gin and tonic]], a [[pink gin]], or a [[Singapore Sling]]. Although [[pith helmets]] are mostly confined to military ceremonies, civilians still wear white [[dinner jacket]]s or even [[Red Sea rig]] on occasion. The use of [[curry powder]] has long since spread to the [[metropole]].

From the 1950s, scheduled flights on [[jet airliners]] further increased the speed of international travel. This enabled a [[hypermobility (travel)|hypermobility]] which led to the [[jet set]], and eventually to [[global nomad]]s and the concept of a [[perpetual traveler]].

In recent years, terrorist attacks against Westerners have at times curtailed the party lifestyle of some expatriate communities, especially in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/28/saudiarabia.terrorism |title=Expat Brits live in fear as Saudis turn on the West  |last1=Harris |first1=Paul |last2=Pelham |first2=Nick |last3=Bright |first3=Martin |date=28 July 2002 |website=The Guardian |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |access-date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of expatriates in the world is difficult to determine, since there is no governmental census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dumont|first=Jean-Christophe|last2=Lamaitre|first2=Georges|date=2005-11-02|title=Counting Immigrants and Expatriates in OECD Countries|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/counting-immigrants-and-expatriates-in-oecd-countries_eco_studies-v2005-art3-en|journal=OECD Economic Studies|language=en|volume=2005|issue=1|pages=49–83|doi=10.1787/eco_studies-v2005-art3-en|issn=0255-0822}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international market research and consulting company Finaccord estimated the number to be 56.8 million in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finaccord.com/press-release_2014_global-expatriates_-size-segmentation-and-forecast-for-the-worldwide-market.htm|title=Press Release_2014_Global Expatriates: Size, Segmentation and Forecast for the Worldwide Market|website=www.finaccord.com|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; That would resemble the population of [[Tanzania]] or [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-01|title=List of countries by population (United Nations)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)&amp;oldid=812984751|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[multinational corporations]] send employees to foreign countries to work in branch offices or subsidiaries. Expatriate employees allow a parent company to more closely control its foreign subsidiaries. They can also improve global coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Research and Practice in Human Resource Management|last=Chew|first=J|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suurati and Mäkelä discovered the key drivers for expatriates to pursue [[international]] [[Career|careers]] were: breadth of [[Responsibility|responsibilities]]{{dn|date=October 2018}}, nature of the international environment ([[risk]] and challenge), high levels of [[autonomy]] of international posts and [[Culture|cultural]] differences (rethinking old ways).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vesa Suutari|last2=Kristiina Mäkelä|date=2007-09-25|title=The career capital of managers with global careers|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/02683940710820073|journal=Journal of Managerial Psychology|volume=22|issue=7|pages=628–648|doi=10.1108/02683940710820073|issn=0268-3946}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, expatriate professionals and independent expatriate hires are often more expensive than local employees. Expatriate salaries are usually augmented with allowances to compensate for a higher [[cost of living]] or hardships associated with a foreign posting. Other expenses may need to be paid, such as health care, housing, or fees at an [[international school]]. There is also the cost of moving a family and their belongings. Another problem can be government restrictions in the foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gomez-Mejia|first=Luis| last2=Balkin|first2=David| last3=Cardy|first3=Robert|title=Managing Human Resources|year=2007|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-187067-X|pages=544–5}}

Spouses may have trouble adjusting due to [[culture shock]], loss of their usual social network, interruptions to their own career, and helping children cope with a new school. These are chief reasons given for foreign assignments ending early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pilenzo |first=R |title=DOES CULTURE REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN EXPAT ASSIGNMENTS? |journal=Expatriates Magazine |date=September 2013 |issue=2 |page=4 |url=http://expatriatesmagazine.com/index.php/publication/issue-2/item/198-does-culture-really-make-a-difference-in-expat-assignments? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005010521/http://expatriatesmagazine.com/index.php/publication/issue-2/item/198-does-culture-really-make-a-difference-in-expat-assignments |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a spouse can also act as a source of support for an expatriate professional.&lt;ref&gt;Lauring, J., &amp; Selmer, J. 2010. The supportive expatriate spouse: An ethnographic study of spouse involvement in expatriate careers. International Business Review, 19(1): 59-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Families with children help to bridge the language and culture aspect of the host and home country, while the spouse plays a critical role in balancing the families integration into the culture. Some corporations have begun to include spouses earlier when making decisions about a foreign posting, and offer [[coaching]] or adjustment training before a family departs.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} According to the 2012 Global Relocation Trends Survey Report, 88 per cent of spouses resist a proposed move. The most common reasons for refusing an assignment are family concerns and the spouse's career.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of International Human Resource Management|last=Thomas|first=David|publisher=SAGE|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4129-9591-7|location=London|pages=190–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Expatriate failure'' is a term which has been coined for an employee returning prematurely to their  home country, or resigning. One study found that the expatriate failure rate is put at 20 to 40 per cent by 69 per cent of executives with multinational corporations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Expatriate children ==
Another issue with expatriate children is that often when children are raised in a country that is not their passport country, when they go back to their home country or leave their known community, they find themselves lost and without friends or peers to relate to. Children or young adults like this are called [[Third culture kid]]s. This means that they have essentially two cultures within themselves- the country in which they are living and the country they identify with as their passport country. This creates an assortment of issues- including the fact that they do not have an exact culture. Because they are a jumble of cultures, they don't feel as if they have a category in this world. Therefore, this creates a middle zone called the "third culture." The culture is a safe haven for misunderstood expatriate children to reside in.

There are many questions third culture kids face, such as the most commonly struggled with one- "Where are you from?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/education-and-family/the-10-biggest-struggles-for-a-third-culture-kid/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; These types of questions are incredibly difficult for expats to explain. Even expat parents may not be able to answer the burning questions they have been asked by their children. Students living abroad also have to choose schools- often opting for [[international school]]s, due to the fact that the environment is an area that is practically a habitat to cultivate understanding between third culture kids. Students going to international schools often feel understood more deeply by going to the school- rather than how understood they would feel at any other school that is on their passport. This is simply because of the subconscious understanding between children who are struggling in the same ways with their identity.

There are also downsides to expatriate life, however. Expatriate life is difficult- it is not for the faint of heart. Because of the trauma of moving from place to place; young children, specifically between the ages 10-15, experience what is called Expat Child Syndrome. Expat Child Syndrome is defined as ''"..a term that has been coined by psychologists to describe an emotional stress in children caused by a move abroad."'' Expat Child Syndrome is present in many ways- some visible and some invisible. Some children may be more affected by it than others. The more severe cases include behavior of seclusion, loneliness, withdrawn behavior and uncooperative or even disruptive behavior. Nevertheless, abrupt movement between cultures and communities is uprooting and terrifying for children and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.expatinfodesk.com/expat-guide/moving-with-your-children/expat-child-syndrome-ecs/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent trends===
Trends in recent years among business expatriates have included:
* Reluctance by employees to accept foreign assignments, due to spouses also having a career.
* Reluctance by multinational corporations to sponsor overseas assignments, due to increased sensitivity both to costs and to local cultures.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* Short-term assignments becoming more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jwb.2007.02.005| title = Changing patterns of global staffing in the multinational enterprise: Challenges to the conventional expatriate assignment and emerging alternatives| journal = Journal of World Business| volume = 42| issue = 2| page = 198| year = 2007| last1 = Collings | first1 = D.

'''Fire-retardant fabrics''' are textiles that are naturally more [[Fire safety|resistant to fire]] than others through chemical treatment or manufactured [[fireproof]] fibers.

==Terminology and test limitations==
The term ''fire-retardant'' as applied to [[Organic compound|organic]] (i.e., containing carbon) materials, is intended to refer to ''reduced'' fire hazard, as all will burn under certain circumstances. The tests used specified in [[building code]]s, such as NFPA 701, are more correctly ''flame resistance'' tests, which test a fabric's ability to resist ignition with the flame size and duration in the test conditions.&lt;ref&gt;NFPA 701,D1.1&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a comparative test, which provides a measure of the material's resistance to propagating combustion caused by small scale ignition sources. These tests do not predict the burning characteristics of full scale hazards. In many cases, if exposed to a sufficiently large and sustained exposure fire, the fire-retardant fabrics will burn vigorously. [[Polyester]] is inherently flame retardant, and therefore doesn't flare up when applied to various tests. Any amount of heat delivered within a long enough time interval will have no impact on the fabrics' integrity while a limited amount of heat delivered within short enough time interval may ignite or melt the fabric. A simple method for evaluating the threshold incident energy for ignition or melting of fabrics as a function of convective and radiant heat flux has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcblasts.com/faq/ignition-melting-characteristics-fabrics-textiles.html Ignition and Melting Characteristics of Apparel Fabrics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curtains==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Flame Retardant Curtains and Furnishings.jpg|thumbnail|Hotel Flame Retardant Curtains and Fabrics.]] --&gt;
Inherently flame-retardant fabrics are certified in the [[United Kingdom]] by various [[British Standards]]. Fire-retardant fabrics sold in the UK for use as [[curtain]]s must abide by BS 5867 Part 2 B &amp; C, a British Standard. Other relevant UK standards include BS 5815-1 2005, BS 7175, Crib 5, IMO A563 and NFPA 701.

==Stage drapery==
Fabric [[flammability]] is an important [[textile]] issue, especially for stage drapery that will be used in a public space such as a [[school]], [[theatre]] or special event venue. In the United States, Federal regulations require that drapery fabrics used in such spaces be certified as flame or fire-retardant. For draperies and other fabrics used in public places, this is known as the NFPA 701 Test, which follows standards developed by the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA). Although all [[textile|fabric]]s will burn, some are naturally more resistant to fire than others. Those that are more flammable can have their fire resistance drastically improved by treatment with fire-retardant chemicals.

Inherently flame-retardant fabrics such as polyester are commonly used for flame retardant curtain fabrics.

==Fire-retardancy fabric treatment==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Flame-Retardant-Logo.jpg|thumbnail|flame retardant fabric logo]] --&gt;
Fire-retardant fabrics are normally treated to different [[British Standards]]; normally this depends on the end usage of the fabrics. BS 476 is a fire treatment for fabrics that are normally for wall hanging, and must only be used as for that purpose, where as CRIB 5 is a fabric fire treatment for upholstery and must only be used for furnishing and upholstery purposes,  even if both fabrics have been treated for fire-retardancy.
The relevant standards for fire-retardant fabrics include:
* BS 5852:2006 describes the best practice methods to assess the ignitability of single material combinations, such as covers and fillings used in upholstered seating, or complete items of seating. These tests determine the effects of a smouldering cigarette, or other flaming ignition sources such as burning matches or a four-sheet full-size newspaper. This standard can be used to establish the potential ignitability of components in conjunction with other specified materials.&lt;ref name="British Standards Institue"&gt;{{cite web|title=BSI|url=http://www.bsigroup.co.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt; BS 5852:2006 first looks at the criteria of ignition, and the health and safety of operators. It then explains the various apparatus, before focussing on smouldering ignition sources – such as a cigarette, butane gas flames and flaming wooden cribs. It also looks at ways to test for the ignitability of upholstery composites and complete items of furniture. The standard concludes with a final examination and test report.BS 5852:2006 replaces the older certification standard, BS 5852 - 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030057626 British Standards Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;
*BS 5867 is  for flame retardant fabrics. It relates to curtains, blinds and drapes for windows when tested by the methods specified in BS 5438:1976. Where appropriate, a cleansing or wetting procedure specified in BS 5651 may also be required.&lt;ref name="British Standards Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=British Standards Group|url=http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000000074918}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Source 5 (Crib 5) is related to [[upholstery]] and furniture coverings, and is related to BS 5852. The crib test uses a plank made from wood that is glued together. The fabrics is attached over the lint, then at bottom and a propane-diol is added. The testing unit is then ignited with a match. To decide whether the test has been passed the fabric and the crib are assessed to see whether there is [[Flame|flaming]] or smoldering on both the outer cover and the interior material. Assuming it does not ignite or smolder, the material will pass the test as no ignition. Similar tests  include Source 0 (smouldering cigarette) and Source 1 (simulated match).
*[[Class 0]]
*[[Appliance classes#Class I|Class 1]]
*BS 476

The M1 standard is a European standard that is widely used in Europe only. Most UK fire officers are reluctant to accept MI certification, they prefer BS certificates.

==Durability and cleaning of fabric and drapes==
When a fabric is designated as ''inherently fire-retardant'', ''permanently fire-retardant'', or ''durably fire-retardant'', the flame retardancy will last for the life of the fabric as it has been woven into the fabric fiber itself. The drapery can be laundered or dry-cleaned as recommended by the drapery manufacturer.  In the case of fabrics that are designated as ''fire-retardant'', that have been topically treated with chemicals, the flame retardancy of the fabric will dissipate over time, particularly with repeated cleaning. As these chemicals are soluble in liquids-either  water or dry cleaning fluid, these fabrics must be dry-cleaned with a non-liquid cleaning agent.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} The flame retardants work by coating the flammable fabrics with a mineral based barrier, preventing fire from reaching the fibres. 

Typically, the flame retardancy of topically treated fabric is certified for one year,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} though the actual length of time in which the treatment remains effective will vary based on the number of times the drapery is dry-cleaned and the environmental conditions in the location in which the drapery is used.  It is recommended that topically treated drapery be re-tested for fire-retardancy on an annual basis and re-treated by a qualified professional as needed.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The '''France – Solomon Islands Maritime Delimitation Agreement''' is a 1990 [[treaty]] in which [[France]] and the [[Solomon Islands]] agreed to a [[maritime boundary]] between the Solomon Islands and the French territory of [[New Caledonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). ''International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas,'' p.&amp;nbsp;296; Charney, Jonathan I. ''et al.'' (2005). ''International Maritime Boundaries,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1167–1174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty was signed in [[Honiara]] on 12 November 1990. The text of the treaty is brief and sets out a [[border|boundary]] of three straight-line [[ocean|maritime]] segments defined by four individual coordinate points. The boundary runs roughly east to west and represents an approximate equidistant line between New Caledonia and the Solomon Islands.

The treaty came into force on the day it was signed. The full name of the treaty is ''Agreement on maritime delimitation between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Solomon Islands''.

A. Hayek''', was an Austrian economist and philosopher best known for his defense of [[classical liberalism]]. Hayek shared the 1974 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] with [[Gunnar Myrdal]] for his "pioneering work in the [[Monetary policy|theory of money]] and [[Business cycle|economic fluctuations]] and [...] penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1974/index.html|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1974|author=[[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Bank of Sweden]]|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek was also a major social theorist and political philosopher of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=978-0521849777&amp;ss=exc|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hayek (Introduction)|author=Edward Feser|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|quote=among the most important economists and political philosophers of the twentieth century.

Hayek served in [[World War I]] and said that his experience in the war and his desire to help avoid the mistakes that had led to the war drew him into economics. Hayek lived in Austria, Great Britain, the United States and Germany and became a British subject in 1938. He spent most of his academic life at the [[London School of Economics]], the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[University of Freiburg]].

Hayek was appointed a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]] in 1984 for "services to the study of economics".&lt;ref name="LGCH"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=49768|date=16 June 1984|page=4|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebenstein"/&gt; He was the first recipient of the [[Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schleyer-stiftung.de/preise/hms_preis/preise_schleyer_preistraeger_e.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=30 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225032000/http://www.schleyer-stiftung.de/preise/hms_preis/preise_schleyer_preistraeger_e.html|archivedate=25 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1991 from President [[George H.

=== Early life ===
[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|250px|An ethno-linguistic map of Austria–Hungary, 1910]]
Friedrich August von Hayek was born in [[Vienna]] to [[August von Hayek]] and Felicitas Hayek (''née'' von Juraschek). His father, from whom he received his middle name, was born in 1871 also in Vienna. He was a medical doctor employed by the municipal ministry of health with a passion for [[botany]], about which he wrote a number of monographs. August von Hayek was also a part-time botany lecturer at the [[University of Vienna]]. His mother was born in 1875 to a wealthy conservative and land-owning family. As her mother died several years prior to Hayek's birth, Felicitas received a significant inheritance, which provided as much as half of her and her husband's income during the early years of their marriage. Hayek was the oldest of three brothers, Heinrich (1900–1969) and Erich (1904–1986), who were one-and-a-half and five years younger than him.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=7}}

His father's career as a university professor influenced Hayek's goals later in life.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|pp=7–8}} Both of his grandfathers, who lived long enough for Hayek to know them, were scholars. [[:de:Franz von Juraschek|Franz von Juraschek]] was a leading economist in [[Austria-Hungary]] and a close friend of [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]], one of the founders of the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Note: Von Juraschek was a statistician and was later employed by the Austrian government.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek's paternal grandfather, [[Gustav von Hayek|Gustav Edler von Hayek]], taught natural sciences at the Imperial ''Realobergymnasium'' (secondary school) in Vienna. He wrote systematic works in biology, some of which are relatively well known.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=8}}

On his mother's side, Hayek was second cousin to the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. His mother often played with Wittgenstein's sisters and had known him well. As a result of their family relationship, Hayek became one of the first to read Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' when the book was published in its original German edition in 1921. Although he met Wittgenstein on only a few occasions, Hayek said that Wittgenstein's philosophy and methods of analysis had a profound influence on his own life and thought.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, Hayek recalled a discussion of philosophy with Wittgenstein when both were officers during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;''Hayek on Hayek: an autobiographical dialogue'', By Friedrich August Hayek, Routledge, 1994, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; After Wittgenstein's death, Hayek had intended to write a biography of Wittgenstein and worked on collecting family materials and later assisted biographers of Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;''Young Ludwig: Wittgenstein's life'', 1889–1921, Brian McGuinness, Oxford University Press, 2005 p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; He was related to Wittgenstein on the non-Jewish side of the [[Wittgenstein family]]. Since his youth, Hayek frequently socialized with Jewish intellectuals and he mentions that people often speculated whether he was also of Jewish ancestry. That made him curious, so he spent some time researching his ancestors and found out that he has no Jewish ancestors for five generations in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek on Hayek: an autobiographical dialogue, By Friedrich August Hayek, Routledge, 1994, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Surname [[Hayek]] is German spelling of Czech surname [[Hájek]].

Hayek displayed an intellectual and academic bent from a very young age. He read fluently and frequently before going to school.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=9}} At his father's suggestion, as a teenager he read the genetic and evolutionary works of [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[August Weismann]] and the philosophical works of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]].&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/nobelprizewinnin00haye |title=UCLA Oral History 1978 Interviews with Friedrich Hayek, pp. 32–38 |publisher=Archive.org |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In school, Hayek was much taken by one instructor's lectures on [[Aristotle's ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0226320625| last1 = Kresge| first1 = Stephen| last2 = Wenar| first2 = Leif| title = Hayek on Hayek: An Autobiographical Dialogue| date = 2005-07-22}}{{rp|39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his unpublished autobiographical notes, Hayek recalled a division between him and his younger brothers who were only a few years younger than him, but he believed that they were somehow of a different generation. He preferred to associate with adults.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=9}}

[[File:The.Illustrated.London.News.Aug.01.1914.Issue.3928.Vol.CXLV.Page.17.Image.13.png|thumb|Austro-Hungarian artillery unit appearing in [[The Illustrated London News]] in 1914]]
In 1917, Hayek joined an artillery regiment in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] and fought on the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian front]]. Much of Hayek's combat experience was spent as a spotter in an aeroplane. Hayek suffered damage to his hearing in his left ear during the war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/daily/3458|title=Friedrich Hayek as a Teacher - David Gordon|first=|last=kanopiadmin|date=8 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was decorated for bravery. During this time, Hayek also survived the [[1918 flu pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam James Tebble, F.A. Hayek (Continuum, 2010), p. 2, {{ISBN|978-0826435996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek then decided to pursue an academic career, determined to help avoid the mistakes that had led to the war. Hayek said of his experience: "The decisive influence was really [[World War I]]. It's bound to draw your attention to the problems of political organization". He vowed to work for a better world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Deirdre N. McCloskey|title=How to Be Human: Though an Economist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RPw3dMi95WoC&amp;pg=PA33|year=2000|publisher=U of Michigan Press|page=33|isbn=0472067443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and career ===
[[File:Wien - Universität (2).JPG|thumb|240px|University of Vienna's main building seen from across the Ringstraße]]
At the [[University of Vienna]], Hayek earned doctorates in law and political science in 1921 and 1923 respectively and also studied philosophy, psychology and economics. For a short time, when the University of Vienna closed he studied in [[Constantin von Monakow]]'s Institute of Brain Anatomy, where Hayek spent much of his time [[staining]] brain cells. Hayek's time in Monakow's lab and his deep interest in the work of [[Ernst Mach]] inspired his first intellectual project, eventually published as ''The Sensory Order'' (1952). It located connective learning at the physical and neurological levels, rejecting the "sense data" associationism of the [[empiricists]] and [[logical positivism|logical positivists]].&lt;ref name="Backhaus2005"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek presented his work to the private seminar he had created with [[Herbert Furth]] called [[the Geistkreis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae6_2_2.pdf "The Viennese Connection: Alfred Schutz and the Austrian School" by Peter Kurrild-Klitgaard.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During Hayek's years at the University of Vienna, [[Carl Menger]]'s work on the explanatory strategy of social science and [[Friedrich von Wieser]]'s commanding presence in the classroom left a lasting influence on him.&lt;ref name=UCLA/&gt; Upon the completion of his examinations, Hayek was hired by [[Ludwig von Mises]] on the recommendation of Wieser as a specialist for the Austrian government working on the legal and economic details of the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]]. Between 1923 and 1924, Hayek worked as a research assistant to Professor [[Jeremiah Jenks]] of [[New York University]], compiling macroeconomic data on the American economy and the operations of the Federal Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Tebble, ''F.A. Hayek'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Austrian School sidebar|people}}
Initially sympathetic to Wieser's [[democratic socialism]], Hayek's economic thinking shifted away from socialism and toward the [[classical liberalism]] of Carl Menger after reading von Mises' book ''[[Socialism (book)|Socialism]]''. It was sometime after reading ''Socialism'' that Hayek began attending von Mises' private seminars, joining several of his university friends, including [[Fritz Machlup]], [[Alfred Schutz]], [[Felix Kaufmann]] and [[Gottfried Haberler]], who were also participating in Hayek's own more general and private seminar. It was during this time that he also encountered and befriended noted political philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]], with whom he retained a long-standing relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Federici, Michael.

[[File:LSE main entrance.jpg|thumb|LSE's Old Building]]
With the help of Mises, in the late 1920s he founded and served as director of the [[Austrian Institute of Economic Research|Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research]] before joining the faculty of the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) in 1931 at the behest of [[Lionel Robbins]]. Upon his arrival in London, Hayek was quickly recognised as one of the leading economic theorists in the world and his development of the economics of processes in time and the co-ordination function of prices inspired the ground-breaking work of [[John Hicks]], [[Abba P. Lerner]] and many others in the development of modern microeconomics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baxendale |first=Toby |url=http://www.cobdencentre.org/2010/07/the-battle-of-the-letters/ |title=The Battle of the Letters: Keynes v Hayek 1932, Skidelsky v Besley 2010 |publisher=The Cobden Centre |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, Hayek suggested that private investment in the public markets was a better road to wealth and economic co-ordination in Britain than government spending programs as argued in an exchange of letters with [[John Maynard Keynes]], co-signed with Lionel Robbins and others in ''[[The Times]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkmarkets.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/keynes-hayek-1932-cambridgelse.pdf |title=Info |last= |first= |date=2010 |website=thinkmarkets.files.wordpress.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Perrine McNair, Richard Stockton Meriam, ''Problems in business economics'', McGraw-Hill, 1941, p. 504&lt;/ref&gt; The nearly decade long [[deflation]]ary depression in Britain dating from [[Winston Churchill]]'s decision in 1925 to return Britain to the [[gold standard]] at the old pre-war and pre-inflationary par was the public policy backdrop for Hayek's dissenting engagement with Keynes over British monetary and fiscal policy. Well beyond that single public conflict, regarding the economics of extending the length of production to the economics of labour inputs, Hayek and Keynes disagreed on many essential economics matters. Their economic disagreements were both practical and fundamental in nature. Keynes called Hayek's book ''Prices and Production'' "one of the most frightful muddles I have ever read", famously adding: "It is an extraordinary example of how, starting with a mistake, a remorseless logician can end in Bedlam".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-14366054 Keynes v Hayek: Two economic giants go head to head]
 Business–''BBC News'', 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other notable economists have also been staunch critics of Hayek, including [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and later [[Paul Krugman]], who wrote that "the Hayek thing is almost entirely about politics rather than economics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/int_johnkennethgalbraith.html#3 Commanding Heights–John Kenneth Galbraith–Interview Conducted 09/29/2000], ''PBS''.org &amp; accessed 21 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman.

Unwilling to return to Austria after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' brought it under the control of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938, Hayek remained in Britain. Hayek and his children became [[British subject]]s in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34541|date=12 August 1938 |page=5182}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held this status for the remainder of his life, but he did not live in Great Britain after 1950.

=== ''The Road to Serfdom'' ===
{{Liberalism sidebar|width=22em}}
{{Libertarianism sidebar|width=22em}}
{{main|The Road to Serfdom}}
Hayek was concerned about the general view in Britain's academia that fascism was a capitalist reaction to socialism and ''The Road to Serfdom'' arose from those concerns. It was written between 1940 and 1943. The title was inspired by the French classical liberal thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s writings on the "road to servitude".&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in Britain by [[Routledge]] in March 1944 and was quite popular, leading Hayek to call it "that unobtainable book" also due in part to wartime paper rationing.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; When it was published in the United States by the University of Chicago in September of that year, it achieved greater popularity than in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Tebble, ''F.A. Hayek'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; At the instigation of editor [[Max Eastman]], the American magazine ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' also published an abridged version in April 1945, enabling ''The Road to Serfdom'' to reach a far wider audience than academics. The book is widely popular among those advocating [[individualism]] and [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beam|first1=Christopher|title=The Trouble With Liberty|url=http://nymag.com/news/politics/70282/index2.html|accessdate=7 November 2015|work=New York Magazine|publisher=New York Media, LLC|date=Jan 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chicago ===
{{Chicago school sidebar|people}}
In 1950, Hayek left the London School of Economics. After spending the 1949–1950 academic year as a visiting professor at the [[University of Arkansas]], Hayek was brought on by the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in the [[Committee on Social Thought]]. Hayek's salary was funded not by the university, but by an outside foundation, the [[William Volker Fund]].

Hayek had made contact with many at the University of Chicago in the 1940s, with Hayek's ''The Road to Serfdom'' playing a seminal role in transforming how [[Milton Friedman]] and others understood how society works.&lt;ref&gt;Milton and Rose Friedman, ''Two Lucky People: Memoirs'' (Chicago: U. of Chicago Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek conducted a number of influential faculty seminars while at the University of Chicago and a number of academics worked on research projects sympathetic to some of Hayek's own, such as [[Aaron Director]], who was active in the [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]] in helping to fund and establish what became the "Law and Society" program in the University of Chicago Law School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross B. Emmett|title=The Elgar Companion to the Chicago School of Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaCciKWcDIAC&amp;pg=PA266|year=2010|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|pages= 164, 200, 266–67|isbn=9781849806664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek, [[Frank Knight]], Friedman and [[George Stigler]] worked together in forming the [[Mont Pèlerin Society]], an international forum for neoliberals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Milton|date=1951|title=Neo-Liberalism and its Prospects|url=|journal=Farmand|volume=|pages=89-93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hayek and Friedman cooperated in support of the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists, later renamed the [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]], an American student organisation devoted to libertarian ideas.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Van Overtveldt, ''The Chicago School: How the University of Chicago Assembled the Thinkers Who Revolutionized Economics and Business''(2006) pp. 7, 341–46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harper Midway Chicago.jpg|thumb|left|University of Chicago from the [[Midway Plaisance]]]]
Hayek's first class at Chicago was a faculty seminar on the philosophy of science attended by many of the University of Chicago's most notable scientists of the time, including [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Sewall Wright]] and [[Leó Szilárd]]. During his time at Chicago, Hayek worked on the philosophy of science, economics, political philosophy and the [[history of ideas]]. Hayek's economics notes from this period have yet to be published. Hayek received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertystory.net/LSTHINKHAYEKLIFE.htm Biography] at LibertyStory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

After editing a book on [[John Stuart Mill]]'s letters he planned to publish two books on the liberal order, ''[[The Constitution of Liberty]]'' and "The Creative Powers of a Free Civilization" (eventually the title for the second chapter of ''The Constitution of Liberty'').&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; He completed ''The Constitution of Liberty'' in May 1959, with publication in February 1960. Hayek was concerned that "with that condition of men in which coercion of some by others is reduced as much as is possible in society".&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, ''The Constitution of Liberty'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1960), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek was disappointed that the book did not receive the same enthusiastic general reception as ''The Road to Serfdom'' had sixteen years before.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freiburg, Los Angeles and Salzburg ===
[[File:Freiburg Breisgau um 1900.jpg|thumb|260px|Freiburg around 1900]]
From 1962 until his retirement in 1968, he was a professor at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]], West Germany, where he began work on his next book, ''[[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]''. Hayek regarded his years at Freiburg as "very fruitful".&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his retirement, Hayek spent a year as a visiting professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he continued work on ''Law, Legislation and Liberty'', teaching a graduate seminar by the same name and another on the philosophy of social science. Preliminary drafts of the book were completed by 1970, but Hayek chose to rework his drafts and finally brought the book to publication in three volumes in 1973, 1976 and 1979.

[[File:BuildingUniversitySalzburg1.jpg|thumb|260px|University of Salzburg (below, foreground) since the mid 1980s as seen from city center]]
Hayek became a professor at the [[University of Salzburg]] from 1969 to 1977 and then returned to Freiburg, where he spent the rest of his days. When Hayek left Salzburg in 1977, he wrote: "I made a mistake in moving to Salzburg". The economics department was small and the library facilities were inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nobel Memorial Prize Winner ===
On 9 October 1974, it was announced that Hayek would be awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] along with Swedish economist [[Gunnar Myrdal]]. The reasons for the two of them winning the prize are described in the Nobel committee's press release.&lt;ref name="Economics Prize For Works In Economic Theory And Inter-Disciplinary Research"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1974/press.html |title=The Prize in Economics 1974 – Press Release |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=9 October 1974 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was surprised at being given the award and believed that he was given it with Myrdal to balance the award with someone from the opposite side of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Ebenstein, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Nobel ceremony in December 1974, Hayek met the Russian dissident [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]. Hayek later sent him a Russian translation of ''The Road to Serfdom''.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt; He spoke with apprehension at his award speech about the danger the authority of the prize would lend to an economist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1974/hayek-speech.html |title=Friedrich August von Hayek – Banquet Speech |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=10 December 1974 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the prize brought much greater public awareness to the then controversial ideas of Hayek and has been described by his biographer as "the great rejuvenating event in his life".&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British politics ===
{{Thatcherism|people|width=22em}}
In February 1975, [[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]]. The Institute of Economic Affairs arranged a meeting between Hayek and Thatcher in London soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cockett, ''Thinking the Unthinkable. Think-Tanks and the Economic Counter-Revolution, 1931–1983'' (Fontana, 1995), pp. 174–76.&lt;/ref&gt; During Thatcher's only visit to the [[Conservative Research Department]] in the summer of 1975, a speaker had prepared a paper on why the "middle way" was the pragmatic path the Conservative Party should take, avoiding the extremes of left and right. Before he had finished, Thatcher "reached into her briefcase and took out a book. It was Hayek's ''The Constitution of Liberty''. Interrupting our pragmatist, she held the book up for all of us to see. 'This', she said sternly, 'is what we believe', and banged Hayek down on the table".&lt;ref&gt;John Ranelagh, ''Thatcher's People: An Insider's Account of the Politics, the Power, and the Personalities'' (Fontana, 1992), p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Hayek was critical of the [[Lib–Lab pact#1977|Lib–Lab pact]] in which the [[Liberal Party (UK)|British Liberal Party]] agreed to keep the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour]] government in office. Writing to ''The Times'', Hayek said: "May one who has devoted a large part of his life to the study of the history and the principles of liberalism point out that a party that keeps a socialist government in power has lost all title to the name 'Liberal'. Certainly no liberal can in future vote 'Liberal'".&lt;ref&gt;"Letters to the Editor: Liberal pact with Labour", ''The Times'' (31 March 1977), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek was criticised by Liberal politicians [[Gladwyn Jebb]] and [[Andrew Phillips, Baron Phillips of Sudbury|Andrew Phillips]], who both claimed that the purpose of the pact was to discourage socialist legislation.

Lord Gladwyn pointed out that the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|German Free Democrats]] were in coalition with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;"Letters to the Editor: Liberal pact with Labour", ''The Times'' (2 April 1977), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hayek was defended by Professor [[Antony Flew]], who stated that—unlike the British Labour Party—the German Social Democrats had since the late 1950s abandoned public ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange and had instead embraced the [[social market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Letters to the Editor: German socialist aims", ''The Times'' (13 April 1977), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Hayek came into conflict with Liberal Party leader [[David Steel]], who claimed that liberty was possible only with "social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth and power, which in turn require a degree of active government intervention" and that the Conservative Party were more concerned with the connection between liberty and private enterprise than between liberty and democracy. Hayek claimed that a limited democracy might be better than other forms of limited government at protecting liberty, but that an unlimited democracy was worse than other forms of unlimited government because "its government loses the power even to do what it thinks right if any group on which its majority depends thinks otherwise".

Hayek stated that if the Conservative leader had said "that free choice is to be exercised more in the market place than in the ballot box, she has merely uttered the truism that the first is indispensable for individual freedom while the second is not: free choice can at least exist under a dictatorship that can limit itself but not under the government of an unlimited democracy which cannot".&lt;ref&gt;"Letters to the Editor: The dangers to personal liberty", ''The Times'' (11 July 1978), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on central European politics ===
President [[Ronald Reagan]] listed Hayek as among the two or three people who most influenced his philosophy and welcomed Hayek to the White House as a special guest.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Anderson, "Revolution" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1988), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, the writings of Hayek were also a major influence on many of the leaders of the "velvet" revolution in Central Europe during the collapse of the old [[Soviet Empire]]. Some supporting examples include the following:

::There is no figure who had more of an influence, no person had more of an influence on the intellectuals behind the Iron Curtain than Friedrich Hayek. His books were translated and published by the underground and black market editions, read widely, and undoubtedly influenced the climate of opinion that ultimately brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript726.html|title= Transcript for: Friedrich Hayek |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= pbs.org|publisher= |access-date= February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recognition ===
In 1980, Hayek, a non-practising [[Roman Catholic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/events/transcripts/010508et.pdf|title=Cato Institute Book Forum – Friedrich Hayek: a Biography|format=PDF|date=8 May 2001|accessdate=14 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603215913/http://www.cato.org/events/transcripts/010508et.pdf|archivedate=3 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of twelve Nobel laureates to meet with [[Pope John Paul II]] "to dialogue, discuss views in their fields, communicate regarding the relationship between [[Catholicism]] and science, and 'bring to the Pontiff's attention the problems which the Nobel Prize Winners, in their respective fields of study, consider to be the most urgent for contemporary man'".&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek was appointed a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]] (CH) in the [[1984 Birthday Honours]] by [[Elizabeth II]] on the advice of British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] for his "services to the study of economics".&lt;ref name="LGCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebenstein"&gt;[[Alan O.

University of Chicago Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek had hoped to receive a [[baronet]]cy and after being awarded the CH sent a letter to his friends requesting that he be called the English version of Friedrich (i.e. Frederick) from now on. After his twenty-minute audience with the Queen, he was "absolutely besotted" with her according to his daughter-in-law Esca Hayek. Hayek said a year later that he was "amazed by her. That ease and skill, as if she'd known me all my life". The audience with the Queen was followed by a dinner with family and friends at the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]]. When later that evening Hayek was dropped off at the [[Reform Club]], he commented: "I've just had the happiest day of my life".&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, President [[George H. W. Bush]] awarded Hayek the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], one of the two highest civilian awards in the United States, for a "lifetime of looking beyond the horizon". Hayek died on 23 March 1992 in [[Freiburg]], Germany and was buried on 4 April in the [[Neustift am Walde]] cemetery in the northern outskirts of Vienna according to the Catholic rite.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=317}} In 2011, his article "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]" was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in ''[[The American Economic Review]]'' during its first 100 years.&lt;ref name="top" /&gt;

Hayek's principal investigations in economics concerned [[Capital (economics)|capital]], money and the business cycle. [[Ludwig von Mises]] had earlier applied the concept of [[marginal utility]] to the value of money in his ''[[Theory of Money and Credit]]'' (1912) in which he also proposed an explanation for "industrial fluctuations" based on the ideas of the old [[British Currency School]] and of Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]]. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the [[Austrian business cycle theory|Austrian theory of the business cycle]]. Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as ''Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle''. There, Hayek argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his ''Prices and Production'' (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the [[central bank]]'s inflationary [[Credit cycle|credit expansion]] and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low [[interest rate]]s. Hayek claimed that "the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process".

Hayek's analysis was based on [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]]'s concept of the "average period of production"&lt;ref&gt;See the chapter [https://books.google.com/books?id=fkVHIn8y8qkC&amp;pg=PA7 "The collaboration with Keynes and the controversy with Hayek,"], Heinz D. Kurz and Neri Salvadori, "Piero Sraffa's contributions to economics," in ''Critical Essays on Piero Sraffa's Legacy in Economics'', ed. H. D. Kurz, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp. 3–24. {{ISBN|978-0521580892}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the effects that monetary policy could have upon it. In accordance with the reasoning later outlined in his essay "The Use of Knowledge in Society" (1945), Hayek argued that a monopolistic governmental agency like a central bank can neither possess the relevant information which should govern supply of money, nor have the ability to use it correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Collected Works of F.A. Hayek |last=Hayek |first=Friedrich |year=1989 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226320977 |page=202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Lionel Robbins assumed the helm of the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). Eager to promote alternatives to what he regarded as the narrow approach of the school of economic thought that then dominated the English-speaking academic world (centred at the [[University of Cambridge]] and deriving largely from the work of [[Alfred Marshall]]), Robbins invited Hayek to join the faculty at LSE, which he did in 1931. According to Nicholas Kaldor, Hayek's theory of the time-structure of capital and of the business cycle initially "fascinated the academic world" and appeared to offer a less "facile and superficial" understanding of [[macroeconomics]] than the Cambridge school's.&lt;ref name="Kaldor1942"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nicholas Kaldor | title=Professor Hayek and the Concertina-Effect | journal=Economica | volume=9 | year=1942 | pages =359–82 | jstor=2550326 | doi=10.2307/2550326 | issue=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1931, Hayek critiqued [[John Maynard Keynes]]'s ''[[A Treatise on Money|Treatise on Money]]'' (1930) in his "Reflections on the pure theory of Mr. J. M. Keynes"&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, [https://mises.org/daily/2474 "Reflection on the pure theory of money of Mr. J. M. Keynes,"] ''Economica'', '''11''', S. 270–95 (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; and published his lectures at the LSE in book form as ''Prices and Production''.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, [http://liberty.me/library/prices-production/ ''Prices and Production''], (London: Routledge, 1931).&lt;/ref&gt; For Keynes, unemployment and idle resources are caused by a lack of effective demand, but for Hayek they stem from a previous unsustainable episode of easy money and artificially low interest rates. Keynes asked his friend [[Piero Sraffa]] to respond. Sraffa elaborated on the effect of inflation-induced "forced savings" on the capital sector and about the definition of a "natural" interest rate in a growing economy (see [[Sraffa–Hayek debate]]).&lt;ref&gt;P. Sraffa, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2223735 "Dr. Hayek on Money and Capital,"] ''Economic Journal'', '''42''', S. 42–53 (1932).&lt;/ref&gt; Others who responded negatively to Hayek's work on the business cycle included [[John Hicks]], [[Frank Knight]] and [[Gunnar Myrdal]].&lt;ref name="Caldwell-criticism"&gt;Bruce Caldwell, ''Hayek's Challenge: An Intellectual Biography of F. A. Hayek'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004), p. 179. {{ISBN|0226091937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaldor later wrote that Hayek's ''Prices and Production'' had produced "a remarkable crop of critics" and that the total number of pages in British and American journals dedicated to the resulting debate "could rarely have been equalled in the economic controversies of the past".&lt;ref name="Kaldor1942"/&gt;

Hayek continued his research on monetary and capital theory, revising his theories of the relations between credit cycles and capital structure in ''Profits, Interest and Investment'' (1939) and ''The Pure Theory of Capital'' (1941), but his reputation as an economic theorist had by then fallen so much that those works were largely ignored, except for scathing critiques by Nicholas Kaldor.&lt;ref name="Kaldor1942"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaldor1939"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nicholas Kaldor | title=Capital Intensity and the Trade Cycle| journal=Economica| volume=6 | issue=21 | year=1939 | pages=40–66 | doi=10.2307/2549077 | jstor=2549077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lionel Robbins himself, who had embraced the Austrian theory of the business cycle in ''The Great Depression'' (1934), later regretted having written the book and accepted many of the Keynesian counter-arguments.&lt;ref name="Garrison"&gt;[[Roger Garrison|R. W. Garrison]], [http://www.auburn.edu/~garriro/amagi.htm "F. A. Hayek as 'Mr. Fluctooations:' In Defense of Hayek's 'Technical Economics'"], ''Hayek Society Journal'' (LSE), '''5'''(2), 1 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek never produced the book-length treatment of "the dynamics of capital" that he had promised in the ''Pure Theory of Capital.'' After 1941, he continued to publish works on the economics of information, political philosophy, the theory of law and psychology, but seldom on macroeconomics. At the [[University of Chicago]], Hayek was not part of the economics department and did not influence the rebirth of neoclassical theory that took place there (see [[Chicago school of economics]]). When in 1974 he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with Myrdal, the latter complained about being paired with an "ideologue". [[Milton Friedman]] declared himself "an enormous admirer of Hayek, but not for his economics. I think ''Prices and Production'' is a very flawed book. I think his [''Pure Theory of Capital''] is unreadable. On the other hand, ''The Road to Serfdom'' is one of the great books of our time".&lt;ref name="Garrison"/&gt;

=== The economic calculation problem ===
{{main|Economic calculation problem}}
Building on the earlier work of Mises and others, Hayek also argued that while in centrally planned economies an individual or a select group of individuals must determine the distribution of resources, these planners will never have enough information to carry out this allocation reliably. This argument, first proposed by [[Max Weber]], says that the efficient exchange and use of resources can be maintained only through the [[price]] mechanism in free markets (see [[economic calculation problem]]).

In 1935, Hayek published ''Collectivist Economic Planning'', a collection of essays from an earlier debate that had been initiated by Mises. Hayek included Mises's essay in which Mises argued that rational planning was impossible under socialism.

Some socialists such as [[H. D. Dickinson]] and [[Oskar Lange]] responded by invoking [[general equilibrium theory]], which they argued disproved Mises's thesis. They noted that the difference between a planned and a free market system lay in who was responsible for solving the equations. They argued that if some of the prices chosen by socialist managers were wrong, gluts or shortages would appear, signalling them to adjust the prices up or down, just as in a free market. Through such a trial and error, a socialist economy could mimic the efficiency of a free market system while avoiding its many problems.

Hayek challenged this vision in a series of contributions. In "Economics and Knowledge" (1937), he pointed out that the standard equilibrium theory assumed that all agents have full and correct information. However, in the real world different individuals have different bits of knowledge and furthermore some of what they believe is wrong.

In "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]" (1945), Hayek argued that the price mechanism serves to share and synchronise local and personal knowledge, allowing society's members to achieve diverse and complicated ends through a principle of spontaneous [[self-organization]]. He contrasted the use of the price mechanism with central planning, arguing that the former allows for more rapid adaptation to changes in particular circumstances of time and place.&lt;ref&gt;Hein Schreuder, "Coase, Hayek and Hierarchy", In: S. Lindenberg et Hein Schreuder, dir., Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Organization Studies, Pergamon Press&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Hayek set the stage for [[Oliver E. Williamson|Oliver Williamson]]'s later contrast between markets and hierarchies as alternative co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douma, Sytse]] and [[Hein Schreuder]], 2013. "Economic Approaches to Organizations". 5th edition. London: Pearson {{ISBN|0273735292}}, {{ISBN|978-0273735298}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the term [[catallaxy]] to describe a "self-organizing system of voluntary co-operation". Hayek's research into this argument was specifically cited by the Nobel Committee in its press release awarding Hayek the Nobel prize.&lt;ref name="Economics Prize For Works In Economic Theory And Inter-Disciplinary Research"/&gt;

=== Criticism of collectivism ===
[[File:Individualism and Economic Order (Hayek book) cover art.jpg|thumb|180px|Front cover art for Hayek's book ''Individualism and Economic Order'', 1948]]
Hayek was one of the leading academic critics of collectivism in the 20th century. Hayek argued that all forms of collectivism (even those theoretically based on voluntary co-operation) could only be maintained by a central authority of some kind. In Hayek's view, the central role of the state should be to maintain the [[rule of law]], with as little arbitrary intervention as possible. In his popular book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944) and in subsequent academic works, Hayek argued that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn leads towards [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Ha-Joon|title=Economics: The User's Guide|date=2014|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|location=London|isbn=978-0718197032|language=English|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Road to Serfdom'', Hayek wrote:{{quote|Although our modern socialists' promise of greater freedom is genuine and sincere, in recent years observer after observer has been impressed by the unforeseen consequences of socialism, the extraordinary similarity in many respects of the conditions under "communism" and "fascism".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hayek, FA. ''The Road to Serfdom'', Ch. 9&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Hayek posited that a central planning authority would have to be endowed with powers that would impact and ultimately control social life because the knowledge required for centrally planning an economy is inherently decentralised, and would need to be brought under control.

Though Hayek did argue that the state should provide law centrally, others have pointed out that this contradicts his arguments about the role of judges in "discovering" the law, suggesting that Hayek would have supported decentralized provision of legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stringham|first1=Edward|last2=Zywicki|first2=Todd|title=Hayekian Anarchism|journal=George Mason University Law and Economics Research Paper Series|date=January 20, 2011|volume=11|issue=6|ssrn=1744364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek also wrote that the state can play a role in the economy, specifically in creating a safety net, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/07/hayek_on_social_insurance.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Hayek on Social Insurance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Investment and choice ===
Perhaps more fully than any other economist, Hayek investigated the [[rational choice theory|choice theory]] of investment. He examined the inter-relations between non-permanent production goods and "latent" or potentially economic permanent resources, building on the choice theoretical insight that "processes that take more time will evidently not be adopted unless they yield a greater return than those that take less time".&lt;ref&gt;''The Pure Theory of Capital'' ([https://mises.org/books/puretheory.pdf pdf]), Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1941/2007 (Vol. 12 of the Collected Works): p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek's work on the [[microeconomics]] of the choice theoretics of investment, non-permanent goods, potential permanent resources and economically-adapted permanent resources mark a central dividing point between his work in areas of [[macroeconomics]] and that of almost all other economists. Hayek's work on the macroeconomic subjects of [[central planning]], trade cycle theory, the division of knowledge and entrepreneurial adaptation especially, differ greatly from the opinions of macroeconomic "[[Alfred Marshall|Marshallian]]" economists who follow the tradition of [[John Maynard Keynes]] and the microeconomic "[[Léon Walras|Walrasian]]" economists who follow the tradition of [[Abba Lerner]].

=== Philosophy of science ===
{{see also|The Counter-Revolution of Science}}
During World War II, Hayek began the Abuse of Reason project. His goal was to show how a number of then-popular doctrines and beliefs had a common origin in some fundamental misconceptions about the social science.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Caldwell, Bruce. "Hayek, Friedrich August von (1899–1992)." The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Third Edition. Eds. Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume. Palgrave Macmillan, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[philosophy of science]], which has much in common with that of his good friend [[Karl Popper]], Hayek was highly critical of what he termed "[[scientism]]", a false understanding of the methods of science that has been mistakenly forced upon the social sciences, but that is contrary to the practices of genuine science. Usually, scientism involves combining the philosophers' ancient demand for demonstrative justification with the associationists' false view that all scientific explanations are simple two-variable linear relationships.

Hayek points out that much of science involves the explanation of complex multivariable and nonlinear phenomena{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} and the social science of economics and undesigned order compares favourably with such complex sciences as Darwinian biology. These ideas were developed in ''[[The Counter-Revolution of Science]]'' in 1952 and in some of Hayek's later essays in the philosophy of science such as "Degrees of Explanation" (1955) and "The Theory of Complex Phenomena" (1964).

In ''Counter-Revolution'', for example, Hayek observed that the hard sciences attempt to remove the "human factor" to obtain objective and strictly controlled results: {{quote|[T]he persistent effort of modern Science has been to get down to "objective facts," to cease studying what men thought about nature or regarding the given concepts as true images of the real world, and, above all, to discard all theories which pretended to explain phenomena by imputing to them a directing mind like our own. Instead, its main task became to revise and reconstruct the concepts formed from ordinary experience on the basis of a systematic testing of the phenomena, so as to be better able to recognize the particular as an instance of a general rule.|Friedrich Hayek|''The Counter-Revolution of Science'' (Chapter II, "The Problem and the Method of the Natural Sciences")}}

Meanwhile, the soft sciences are attempting to measure [[praxeology|human action]] itself:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fee.org/freeman/detail/book-review-the-counter-revolution-of-science-studies-on-the-abuse-of-reason-by-f-a-hayek|title=Book Review: The Counter-revolution of Science: Studies on the Abuse of Reason by F. A. Hayek - Bettina Bien Greaves|date=1 April 1981|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The social sciences in the narrower sense, i.e., those which used to be described as the moral sciences, are concerned with man's conscious or reflected action, actions where a person can be said to choose between various courses open to him, and here the situation is essentially different. The external stimulus which may be said to cause or occasion such actions can of course also be defined in purely physical terms. But if we tried to do so for the purposes of explaining human action, we would confine ourselves to less than we know about the situation.|Friedrich Hayek|''The Counter-Revolution of Science'' (Chapter III, "The Subjective Character of the Data of the Social Sciences")}}

He notes that these are mutually exclusive and that [[social science]]s should not attempt to impose [[positivist]] methodology, nor to claim objective or definite results:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_8g8eK-Q5kC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q=%22counter-revolution+of+science%22+positivism|title=The Moral Foundations of Civil Society|first=Wilhelm|last=RÃ¶pke|publisher=Transaction Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===
In ''The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology'' (1952), Hayek independently developed a "[[Hebbian learning]]" model of learning and memory—an idea he first conceived in 1920 prior to his study of economics. Hayek's expansion of the "Hebbian synapse" construction into a global brain theory has received attention in neuroscience, [[cognitive science]], computer science, behavioural science and [[evolutionary psychology]] by scientists such as [[Gerald Edelman]] and [[Joaquin Fuster]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Edelman]], Neural Darwinism, 1987, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin Fuster, Memory in the Cerebral Cortex: An Empirical Approach to Neural Networks in the Human and Nonhuman Primate. Cambridge: [[MIT Press]], 1995, p. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin Fuster, "Network Memory", Trends in Neurosciences, 1997. Vol. 20, No. 10. (Oct.): 451–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sensory Order'' can be viewed as a development of his attack on scientism. Hayek posited two orders, namely the sensory order that we experience and the natural order that natural science has revealed. Hayek thought that the sensory order actually is a product of the brain. He described the brain as a very complex yet self-ordering hierarchical classification system, a huge network of connections. Because of these nature of the classifier system, richness of our sensory experience can exist. Hayek's description posed problems to [[behaviorism]], whose proponents took the sensory order as fundamental.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Social and political philosophy ===
In the latter half of his career, Hayek made a number of contributions to [[social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]] which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hayek|url= |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society – A selected essay reprint |publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions. He argues in favour of a society organised around a market order in which the apparatus of state is employed almost (though not entirely) exclusively to enforce the legal order (consisting of abstract rules and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function. These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from [[epistemological]] concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge. Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic and free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be "a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it".&lt;ref&gt;''Individualism and Economic Order'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hayek believed in a society governed by laws, he disapproved of the notion of "[[social justice]]". He compared the market to a game in which "there is no point in calling the outcome just or unjust"&lt;ref&gt;''The Mirage of Social Justice'', chap. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that "social justice is an empty phrase with no determinable content".&lt;ref name=hayek1948ch12&gt;''The Mirage of Social Justice'', chap. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, "the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question as to whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just has no meaning".&lt;ref&gt;''The Constitution of Liberty'', chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He generally regarded government redistribution of income or capital as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom, saying that "the principle of distributive justice, once introduced, would not be fulfilled until the whole of society was organized in accordance with it. This would produce a kind of society which in all essential respects would be the opposite of a free society".&lt;ref name=hayek1948ch12/&gt;

==== Spontaneous order ====
{{main|Spontaneous order}}
Hayek viewed the [[free price system]] not as a conscious invention (that which is intentionally designed by man), but as spontaneous order or what Scottish philosopher [[Adam Ferguson]] referred to as "the result of human action but not of human design".&lt;ref name="Ferguson1767"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Adam|title=An Essay on the History of Civil Society|publisher=T. Cadell, London|year=1767|location=The Online Library of Liberty|page=205|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1428&amp;Itemid=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Hayek put the price mechanism on the same level as language.

Hayek attributed the birth of civilisation to [[private property]] in his book ''[[The Fatal Conceit]]'' (1988). He explained that [[price signals]] are the only means of enabling each economic decision maker to communicate [[tacit knowledge]] or [[dispersed knowledge]] to each other to solve the economic calculation problem. [[Alain de Benoist]] of the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' (New Right) produced a highly critical essay on Hayek's work in an issue of ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'', citing the flawed assumptions behind Hayek's idea of "[[spontaneous order]]" and the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and totalising implications of his [[Free market|free-market]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Benoist |first=Alain |authorlink=Alain de Benoist |title=Hayek: A Critique |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |year=1998 |issue=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek's concept of the market as a spontaneous order has been recently applied to ecosystems to defend a broadly non-interventionist policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ecosystems as Spontaneous Orders|ssrn = 2501745|date = 2014-09-24|location = Rochester, NY|first = Andy|last = Lamey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the market, ecosystems contain complex networks of information, involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ecosystems as Spontaneous Orders|ssrn = 2501745|date = 2014-09-24|location = Rochester, NY|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 2–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements. Human ignorance about the countless interactions between the organisms of an ecosystem limits our ability to manipulate nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ecosystems as Spontaneous Orders|ssrn = 2501745|date = 2014-09-24|location = Rochester, NY|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since humans rely on the ecosystem to sustain themselves, we have a ''prima facie'' obligation to not disrupt such systems. This analysis of ecosystems as spontaneous orders does not rely on markets qualifying as spontaneous orders. As such, one need not endorse Hayek's analysis of markets to endorse ecosystems as spontaneous orders.

==== Hayek's views on social safety nets ====
With regard to a [[social safety net]], Hayek advocated "some provision for those threatened by the extremes of indigence or starvation due to circumstances beyond their control" and argued that the "necessity of some such arrangement in an industrial society is unquestioned—be it only in the interest of those who require protection against acts of desperation on the part of the needy".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Friedrich|last=Hayek|editor-first=Ronald|editor-last=Hamowy|editor-link=Ronald Hamowy|title=[[The Constitution of Liberty]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|place=[[Chicago]]|edition=Definitive|year=2011|page=405|origyear=1960|isbn=978-0-226-31539-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing Hayek's views on the topic, journalist [[Nicholas Wapshott]] has argued that "[Hayek] advocated mandatory universal health care and unemployment insurance, enforced, if not directly provided, by the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Nicholas|last=Wapshott|author-link=Nicholas Wapshott|title=Keynes Hayek: The Clash That Defined Modern Economics|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|place=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2011|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Critical theory|Critical theorist]] [[Bernard Harcourt]] has argued further that "Hayek was adamant about this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harcourt|first=Bernard|author-link=Bernard Harcourt|title=How Paul Ryan enslaves Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/12/paul-ryan-enslaves-friedrich-hayek-road-serfdom|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=27 December 2014|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Hayek wrote in ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'': {{quote|There is no reason why in a society which has reached the general level of wealth which ours has attained [that security against severe physical privation, the certainty of a given minimum of sustenance for all; or more briefly, the security of a [[Guaranteed minimum income|minimum income]]] should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom. There are difficult questions about the precise standard which should thus be assured... but there can be no doubt that some minimum of food, shelter, and clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work, can be assured to everybody. Indeed, for a considerable part of the population of [[England]] this sort of security has long been achieved.

Nor is there any reason why the state should not assist... individuals in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision. Where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance – where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks – the case for the state's helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong.... [And] there is no incompatibility in principle between the state's providing greater security in this way and the preservation of [[Individualism#Political individualism|individual freedom]]. Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make the provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Friedrich|last=Hayek|editor-first=Bruce|editor-last=Caldwell|editor-link=Bruce Caldwell (economist)|title=[[The Road to Serfdom]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|place=[[Chicago]]|edition=Definitive|year=2007|pages=147–48|origyear=1944|isbn=978-0-226-32055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In 1973, Hayek reiterated in ''[[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;There is no reason why in a free society government should not assure to all, protection against severe deprivation in the form of an [[Guaranteed minimum income|assured minimum income]], or a [[Basic income|floor below which nobody need to descend]]. To enter into such an insurance against extreme misfortune may well be in the interest of all; or it may be felt to be a clear moral duty of all to assist, within the organised community, those who cannot help themselves.  So long as such a uniform minimum income is provided outside the market to all those who, for any reason, are unable to earn in the market an adequate maintenance, this need not lead to a restriction of freedom, or conflict with the [[Rule of law|Rule of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Friedrich|last=Hayek|title=[[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|place=[[Chicago]]|volume=2|year=1976|page=87|isbn=978-0-226-32083-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Hayek's liberalism and skepticism ====
Arthur M. Diamond argues Hayek's problems arise when he goes beyond claims that can be evaluated within economic science. Diamond argued: &lt;blockquote&gt;The human mind, Hayek says, is not just limited in its ability to synthesize a vast array of concrete facts, it is also limited in its ability to give a deductively sound ground to ethics. Here is where the tension develops, for he also wants to give a reasoned moral defense of the free market. He is an intellectual skeptic who wants to give political philosophy a secure intellectual foundation. It is thus not too surprising that what results is confused and contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Arthur M.|title=F. A. Hayek on Constructivism and Ethics|journal=The Journal of Libertarian Studies|date=Fall 1980|volume=IV/4|pages=353–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Chandran Kukathas]] argues that Hayek's defence of liberalism is unsuccessful because it rests on presuppositions that are incompatible. The unresolved dilemma of his political philosophy is how to mount a systematic defence of liberalism if one emphasizes the limited capacity of reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kukathas|first1=Chandran|title=Hayek and Modern Liberalism|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman P. Barry]] similarly notes that the "critical rationalism" in Hayek's writings appears incompatible with "a certain kind of fatalism, that we must wait for evolution to pronounce its verdict".&lt;ref&gt;N. P. Barry(1994), "The road to freedom—Hayek's social and economic philosophy," in Birner, J., and van Zijp, R. (eds) Hayek, Co-ordination and Evolution – His Legacy in Philosophy, Politics, Economics and the History of Ideas, pp. 141–63. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] argue that the element of paradox exists in the views of Hayek. Noting Hayek's vigorous defense of "invisible hand" evolution that Hayek claimed has created better economic institutions than could be created by rational design, Friedman pointed out the irony that Hayek was then proposing to replace the monetary system thus created with a deliberate construct of his own design.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz, "Has Government Any Role in Money?" (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gray (philosopher)|John N. Gray]] summarized this view as "his scheme for an ultra-liberal constitution was a prototypical version of the philosophy he had attacked".&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, [http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/07/john-gray-friedrich-hayek-i-knew-and-what-he-got-right-and-wrong "The Friedrich Hayek I knew, and what he got right – and wrong"] (30 July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Caldwell (economist)|Bruce Caldwell]] wrote that "[i]f one is judging his work against the standard of whether he provided a finished political philosophy, Hayek clearly did not succeed", although he thinks that "economists may find Hayek's political writings useful".&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Caldwell, ''Hayek's Challenge: An Intellectual Biography of F. A. Hayek'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004), pp. 347–48&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hayek's views on dictatorship ====
{{wikiquote|Friedrich Hayek and dictatorship}}
Hayek sent [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] a copy of ''[[The Constitution of Liberty]]'' (1960) in 1962. Hayek hoped that his book—this "preliminary sketch of new constitutional principles"—"may assist" Salazar "in his endeavour to design a constitution which is proof against the abuses of democracy".&lt;ref name="Farrant, Andrew 2012"&gt;Farrant, Andrew, Edward McPhail, and Sebastian Berger. "Preventing the "Abuses" of Democracy: Hayek, the "Military Usurper" and Transitional Dictatorship in Chile?." American Journal of Economics and Sociology 71.3 (2012): 513–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek visited Chile in the 1970s and 1980s during the [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|Government Junta]] of general [[Augusto Pinochet]] and accepted being appointed Honorary Chairman of the [[Centro de Estudios Públicos]], the think tank formed by the economists who transformed Chile into a free market economy.&lt;ref name="Farrant, Andrew 2012"/&gt; 

Asked about the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|liberal non-democratic rule]] by a Chilean interviewer, Hayek is translated from German to Spanish to English as having said the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;As long term institutions, I am totally against dictatorships. But a dictatorship may be a necessary system for a transitional period. [...] Personally I prefer a liberal dictatorship to democratic government devoid of liberalism. My personal impression – and this is valid for South America – is that in Chile, for example, we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to a liberal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=Bruce |last2=Montes |first2=Leonidas |title=Friedrich Hayek and his visits to Chile |journal=The Review of Austrian Economics |date=26 September 2014 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=261–309 |doi=10.1007/s11138-014-0290-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a letter to the ''[[London Times]]'', he defended the Pinochet regime and said that he had "not been able to find a single person even in much maligned Chile who did not agree that personal freedom was much greater under Pinochet than it had been under [[Salvador Allende|Allende]]".&lt;ref&gt;Greg Grandin, professor of history, New York University, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t5itdZ7oycUC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172#v=onepage ''Empire's Workshop: Latin America, the United States, and the Rise of the New Imperialism]'', pp. 172–73, Metropolitan, 2006, {{ISBN|0805077383}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Avnôn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E6TmN-9qAmQC ''Liberalism and its Practice]'', p. 56, Routledge, 1999, {{ISBN|0415193540}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek admitted that "it is not very likely that this will succeed, even if, at a particular point in time, it may be the only hope there is", but he explained that "[i]t is not certain hope, because it will always depend on the goodwill of an individual, and there are very few individuals one can trust. But if it is the sole opportunity which exists at a particular moment it may be the best solution despite this. And only if and when the dictatorial government is visibly directing its steps towards limited democracy".

For Hayek, the distinction between authoritarianism and totalitarianism has much importance and he was at pains to emphasise his opposition to totalitarianism, noting that the concept of transitional dictatorship which he defended was characterised by authoritarianism, not totalitarianism. For example, when Hayek visited Venezuela in May 1981, he was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in Latin America. In reply, Hayek warned against confusing "totalitarianism with authoritarianism" and said that he was unaware of "any totalitarian governments in Latin America. The only one was Chile under Allende". For Hayek, the word "totalitarian" signifies something very specific, namely the intention to "organize the whole of society" to attain a "definite social goal" which is stark in contrast to "liberalism and individualism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coreyrobin.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/hayekchile.pdf|title=Preventing the "Abuses" of Democracy: Hayek, the "Military Usurper" and Transitional Dictatorship in Chile?|publisher=[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence and recognition ==
Hayek's influence on the development of economics is widely acknowledged. With regard to the popularity of his Nobel acceptance lecture, Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after [[Kenneth Arrow]]) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics. Hayek wrote critically there of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical modelisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skarbek|first1=David|title=F. A. Hayek's Influence on Nobel Prize Winners|journal=Review of Austrian Economics|date=2009|volume=22|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Nobel Laureates]] in economics, such as [[Vernon L. Smith|Vernon Smith]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]], recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist.{{refn | Smith

}} Another Nobel winner, [[Paul Samuelson]], believed that Hayek was worthy of his award, but nevertheless claimed that "there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last half of the twentieth century economist fraternity. In 1931, Hayek's ''Prices and Production'' had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927–1931 (and the 1931–2007) historical scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2008.07.001 | volume=69 | title=A few remembrances of Friedrich von Hayek (1899–1992) | journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization | pages=1–4| year=2009 | last1=Samuelson | first1=Paul A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and Böhm-Bawerk and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to have been right and his own teacher [[Joseph Schumpeter]] to have been wrong on the central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy.&lt;ref&gt;The collected scientific papers of Paul A. Samuelson, Volume 5, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek is widely recognised for having introduced the time dimension to the equilibrium construction and for his key role in helping inspire the fields of [[growth theory]], [[information economics]] and the theory of spontaneous order. The "informal" economics presented in [[Milton Friedman]]'s massively influential popular work ''[[Free to Choose]]'' (1980) is explicitly Hayekian in its account of the price system as a system for transmitting and co-ordinating knowledge. This can be explained by the fact that Friedman taught Hayek's famous paper "The Use of Knowledge in Society" (1945) in his graduate seminars.

In 1944, he was elected as a Fellow of the [[British Academy]]&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Machlup, ''Essays on Hayek'', Routledge, 2003. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; after he was nominated for membership by Keynes.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Nasar, ''Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius'', Simon and Schuster, 2011, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard economist and former Harvard University President [[Lawrence Summers]] explains Hayek's place in modern economics: "What's the single most important thing to learn from an economics course today? What I tried to leave my students with is the view that the invisible hand is more powerful than the [un]hidden hand. Things will happen in well-organized efforts without direction, controls, plans. That's the consensus among economists. That's the Hayek legacy".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Summers, quoted in ''The Commanding Heights: The Battle Between Government and the Marketplace that Is Remaking the Modern World'', by Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. 1998, pp. 150–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1947, Hayek was an organiser of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], a group of [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] who sought to oppose [[socialism]]. Hayek was also instrumental in the founding of the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Right-libertarianism|right-wing libertarian]] and [[free-market]] [[think tank]] that inspired [[Thatcherism]]. He was in addition a member of the [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Philadelphia Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phillysoc.org/DistinguishedMembers.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118151439/http://phillysoc.org/DistinguishedMembers.pdf |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek had a long-standing and close friendship with philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]], who was also from Vienna. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated: "I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps [[Alfred Tarski]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Hacohen, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Popper dedicated his ''Conjectures and Refutations'' to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, ''Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics'', to Popper and in 1982 said that "ever since his ''Logik der Forschung'' first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology".&lt;ref&gt;See Weimer and Palermo, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Popper also participated in the inaugural meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society. Their friendship and mutual admiration do not change the fact that there are important differences between their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;See Birner, 2001, and for the mutual influence they had on each other's ideas on evolution, Birner 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek also played a central role in Milton Friedman's intellectual development. Friedman wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;My interest in public policy and political philosophy was rather casual before I joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. Informal discussions with colleagues and friends stimulated a greater interest, which was reinforced by Friedrich Hayek's powerful book The Road to Serfdom, by my attendance at the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, and by discussions with Hayek after he joined the university faculty in 1950. In addition, Hayek attracted an exceptionally able group of students who were dedicated to a libertarian ideology. They started a student publication, The New Individualist Review, which was the outstanding libertarian journal of opinion for some years. I served as an adviser to the journal and published a number of articles in it....&lt;ref&gt;Milton &amp; Rose Friedman, ''Two Lucky People: Memoirs'' (U. of Chicago Press), 1998. p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hayek's greatest intellectual debt was to [[Carl Menger]], who pioneered an approach to social explanation similar to that developed in Britain by [[Bernard Mandeville]] and the Scottish moral philosophers in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. He had a wide-reaching influence on contemporary economics, politics, philosophy, sociology, psychology and anthropology. For example, Hayek's discussion in ''The Road to Serfdom'' (1944) about truth, falsehood and the use of language influenced some later opponents of [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Wolin 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hayek and conservatism ===
Hayek received new attention in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of conservative governments in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. After winning the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] appointed [[Keith Joseph]], the director of the Hayekian [[Centre for Policy Studies]], as her secretary of state for industry in an effort to redirect parliament's economic strategies. Likewise, [[David Stockman]], [[Ronald Reagan]]'s most influential financial official in 1981, was an acknowledged follower of Hayek.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth R. Hoover, ''Economics as Ideology: Keynes, Laski, Hayek, and the Creation of Contemporary Politics'' (2003), p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek wrote an essay, "Why I Am Not a Conservative" (included as an appendix to ''The Constitution of Liberty''), in which he disparaged conservatism for its inability to adapt to changing human realities or to offer a positive political program, remarking: "Conservatism is only as good as what it conserves". Although he noted that modern day [[conservatism]] shares many opinions on economics with classical liberals, particularly a belief in the [[free market]], he believed it is because conservatism wants to "stand still" whereas [[classical liberalism|liberalism]] embraces the free market because it "wants to go somewhere". Hayek identified himself as a classical liberal, but noted that in the United States it had become almost impossible to use "liberal" in its original definition and the term "[[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]]" has been used instead. In this text, Hayek also opposed conservatism for "its hostility to [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and its proneness to a strident [[nationalism]]", with its frequent association with [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why I Am Not a Conservative |publisher=LewRockwell.com |date= |accessdate=12 October 2011 |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dieteman/dieteman31.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek also found libertarianism a term "singularly unattractive" and offered the term "Old [[British Whig Party|Whig]]" (a phrase borrowed from [[Edmund Burke]]) instead. In his later life, he said: "I am becoming a Burkean Whig". However, Whiggery as a political doctrine had little affinity for classical political economy, the tabernacle of the Manchester School and William Gladstone.&lt;ref&gt;E. H. H. Green, ''Ideologies of Conservatism. Conservative Political Ideas in the Twentieth Century'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; His essay has served as an inspiration to other liberal-minded economists wishing to distinguish themselves from conservative thinkers, for example [[James M. Buchanan]]'s essay "Why I, Too, Am Not a Conservative: The Normative Vision of Classical Liberalism".

His opponents have attacked Hayek as a leading promoter of [[neoliberalism]]. A British journalist, [[Samuel Brittan]], concluded in 2010 that "Hayek's book [''The Constitution of Liberty''] is still probably the most comprehensive statement of the underlying ideas of the moderate free market philosophy espoused by neoliberals".&lt;ref name="brittan"&gt;Samuel Brittan, "The many faces of liberalism," [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/529c55fe-06df-11df-b058-00144feabdc0.html ft.com], 22 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Brittan adds that although [[Raymond Plant, Baron Plant of Highfield|Raymond Plant]] (2009) comes out in the end against Hayek's doctrines, Plant gives ''The Constitution of Liberty'' a "more thorough and fair-minded analysis than it has received even from its professed adherents".&lt;ref name="brittan" /&gt;

In ''Why F A Hayek is a Conservative'',&lt;ref&gt;"Why F A Hayek is a Conservative" Eamonn Butler and Madsen Pirie (eds) ''Hayek on the Fabric of Human Society'' (Adam Smith Institute, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; British policy analyst [[Madsen Pirie]] claims Hayek mistakes the nature of the conservative outlook. Conservatives, he says, are not averse to change, but like Hayek they are highly averse to change being imposed on the social order by people in authority who think they know how to run things better. They wish to allow the market to function smoothly and give it the freedom to change and develop. It is an outlook, says Pirie, that Hayek and conservatives both share.

=== Hayek and policy discussions ===
Hayek's ideas on spontaneous order and the importance of prices in dealing with the knowledge problem has inspired a debate on economic development and transition economies after the fall of the Berlin wall. For instance, [[Peter Boettke]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Boettke, "Why Perestroika Failed", ''The Politics and Economics of Socialist Transformation'', Routledge (1993): https://books.google.com/books?id=4y6IAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=WHY%20PERESTROIKA%20FAILED%20The%20Politics%20and%20Economics%20of%20Socialist%20Transformation&amp;f=false.&lt;/ref&gt; elaborated in detail on why reforming socialism failed and the Soviet Union broke down. Ronald McKinnon&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, Spontaneous Order on the Road Back from Socialism: An Asian Perspective. American Economic Review (1992): https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117371&lt;/ref&gt; uses Hayekian ideas to describe challenges of transition from a centralized state and planned economy to a market economy. Former World Bank Chief Economist William Easterly emphasizes why foreign aid tends to have no effect at best in bestsellers such as White Man's Burden.&lt;ref&gt;W. Easterly, The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good: https://books.google.com/books?id=Dcj_Ju1wICkC&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007–2008 financial crisis]], there is a renewed interest in Hayek's core explanation of boom-and-bust cycles, which serves as an alternative explanation to that of the savings glut as launched by Bernanke. Economists at the Bank of International Settlements, e.g. William White, emphasize the importance of Hayekian insights and the impact of monetary policies and credit growth as root causes of financial cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2009/12/pdf/white.pdf |title=Data |website=www.imf.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A. Hoffmann and G. Schnabl provide an international perspective and explain recurring financial cycles in the world economy as consequence of gradual interest rate cuts led by the central banks in the large advanced economies since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann and Schnabl, A Vicious Cycle of Manias, Crises and Asymmetric Policy Responses – An Overinvestment View. Published in The World Economy 34, 3, 382–403 (2011) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1513171]/ Hoffmann and Schnabl, Monetary Policy, Vagabonding Liquidity and Bursting Bubbles in New and Emerging Markets – An Overinvestment View. Published in The World Economy 31, 9, 1226–52 (2008) &lt;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1018342&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; N. Cachanosky outlines the impact of American monetary policy on the production structure in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Cachanosky (2014).

In line with Hayek, an increasing number of contemporary researchers sees expansionary monetary policies and too low interest rates as mal-incentives and main drivers of financial crises in general and the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|subprime market crisis]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brunnermeier|first=Markus K.|last2=Isabel|first2=Schnabel,|title=Bubbles and Central Banks: Historical Perspectives|url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/markus/publications/bubbles-and-central-banks-historical-perspectives|journal=Central Banks at a Crossroads: What Can We Learn from History?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See John Taylor: https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/13682.html&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent problems caused by monetary policy, Hayekian and Austrian economists discuss alternatives to current policies and organizations. For instance, L. White favors free banking in the spirit of Hayek's "Denationalization of Money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mercatus.org/video/lawrence-h-white-monetary-policy-free-banking-and-financial-crisis|title=Lawrence H. White on Monetary Policy, Free Banking and the Financial Crisis {{!}} Mercatus|website=mercatus.org|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek's ideas find their way into the discussion of the post-[[Great Recession]] issues of [[secular stagnation theory|secular stagnation]]. Monetary policy and mounting regulation is argued to have undermined the innovative forces of the market economies. Quantitative easing following the financial crises is argued to have not only conserved structural distortions in the economy, leading to a fall in trend-growth. It also created new distortions and contributes to distributional conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann and Schnabl, Adverse Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policy, Cato Journal 2016, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2747865&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In August 1926, Hayek married Helen Berta Maria von Fritsch (1901–1960), a secretary at the civil service office where Hayek worked, on the rebound upon hearing of his cousin's marriage. They had two children together.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the close of World War  II, Hayek restarted a relationship with his cousin, who had married since they first met, but kept it secret until 1948. Hayek and Fritsch divorced in July 1950 and he married his cousin{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=169}} Helene Bitterlich (1900–1996)&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; just a few weeks later after moving to Arkansas to take advantage of permissive divorce laws.&lt;ref name="Ebenstein, p. 155"&gt;Ebenstein, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife and children were offered settlement and compensation for accepting a divorce. The divorce caused some scandal at LSE where certain academics refused to have anything to do with Hayek.&lt;ref name="Ebenstein, p. 155"/&gt; In a 1978 interview to explain his actions, Hayek stated that he was unhappy in his first marriage and as his wife would not grant him a divorce he had to enforce it.{{sfn|http://www.hayek.ufm.edu/index.php/Armen_A._Alchian "Armen A. Alchian interviews Friedrich A. Hayek"|48:50}} He rarely visited his children after the divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenstein p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek was brought up in non-religious setting and decided that he was an [[agnostic]] from age 15.{{sfn|Ebenstein|2001|p=13}} He died in 1992 in [[Freiburg, Germany]], where he had lived since leaving Chicago in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/biography-f-hayek-1899-1992|title=Biography of F.

[[File:Gemini-house-2001.jpg|200px|right|thumb|''Gemini House'' rotates in its entirety and the solar panels rotate independently]]

The '''Gemini house''' is a prototype design for a house that uses [[solar energy]] and efficient design.

[[Roland Mösl]] wrote the house's concept in autumn 1991. The name expresses a design goal: The real estate used should serve two purposes simultaneously -- living and generating solar electricity. Ten years later, in 2001, the (up to now) only prototype was built in [[Weiz]], a small town north of [[Graz]] in [[Austria]] as part of a national exhibition about energy. The cylindric house rotates to follow the sun. It is equipped with up to 150m² of [[photovoltaic panel]]s. Extreme thermal insulation and heat recovery from waste air are also included.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18985">[[HVAC]] (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) is a major subdiscipline of [[mechanical engineering]]. The goal of HVAC design is to balance indoor environmental comfort with other factors such as installation cost, ease of maintenance, and energy efficiency. The discipline of HVAC includes a large number of specialized terms and acronyms, many of which are summarized in this glossary.

{{glossary}}
{{term|air changes per hour}}
:{{main|Air changes per hour}} The hourly ventilation rate divided by the volume of a space. For perfectly mixed air or laminar flow spaces, this is equal to the number of times per hour that the volume the space is exchanged by mechanical and natural ventilation. Also called '''air change rate''' or '''air exchange rate'''. Abbreviated '''ACH''' or '''ac/hr'''.
{{term|air conditioner}}
:{{main|Air conditioner}} An appliance, system, or mechanism designed to dehumidify and extract heat from an area. Usually this term is reserved for smaller self contained units such as a residential system.
{{term|air handler}}
{{term|air handling unit|multi=y}}
:{{main|Air handler}} A central unit consisting of a blower, heating and cooling elements, filter racks or chamber, dampers, humidifier, and other central equipment in direct contact with the airflow. This does not include the ductwork through the building. Abbreviated '''AH''' or '''AHU'''.
{{term|term=British thermal unit |content=British thermal unit ({{vanchor|BTU}}) }}
:{{main|British thermal unit}} Any of several units of energy (heat) in the HVAC industry, each slightly more than 1 [[kilojoule|kJ]]. One BTU is the energy required to raise one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit, but the many different types of BTU are based on different interpretations of this “definition”. In the United States the power of HVAC systems (the rate of cooling and dehumidifying or heating) is sometimes expressed in BTU/hour instead of [[watt]]s. Abbreviated '''BTU''' or '''Btu'''.
{{term|centrifugal fan}}
::{{Main|Centrifugal fan}}A centrifugal fan is a mechanical device for moving air or other gases. 
{{term|chiller}}
:{{main|Chiller}} A device that removes heat from a liquid via a vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycle. This cooled liquid flows through pipes in a building and passes through coils in air handlers, fan-coil units, or other systems, cooling and usually dehumidifying the air in the building. Chillers are of two types; air-cooled or water-cooled. Air-cooled chillers are usually outside and consist of condenser coils cooled by fan-driven air. Water-cooled chillers are usually inside a building, and heat from these chillers is carried by recirculating water to a heat sink such as an outdoor cooling tower.
{{term|coil}}
:Equipment that performs heat transfer to air when mounted inside an air handling unit or ductwork. It is heated or cooled by electrical means or by circulating liquid or steam within it.
{{term|condenser}}
:{{main|Condenser (heat transfer)}} A component in the basic [[refrigeration cycle]] that ejects or removes heat from the system. The condenser is the hot side of an air conditioner or heat pump. Condensers are heat exchangers, and can transfer heat to air or to an intermediate fluid (such as water or an aqueous solution of [[ethylene glycol]]) to carry heat to a distant sink, such as ground (earth sink), a body of water, or air (as with cooling towers).
{{term|constant air volume}}
:{{main|Constant air volume}} A system designed to provide a constant air flow. This term is applied to HVAC systems that have variable supply-air temperature but constant air flow rates. Most residential forced-air systems are small CAV systems with on/off control. Abbreviated '''CAV'''.
{{term|controller}}
:{{main|Controller (control theory)}} A device that controls the operation of part or all of a system. It may simply turn a device on and off, or it may more subtly modulate the set point of components. Most controllers are automatic but have user input such as temperature set points, e.g. a [[thermostat]]. Controls may be [[analog signal|analog]] or [[Digital data|digital]].
{{term|damper}}
:{{main|Damper (flow)}} A plate or gate placed in a duct to control air flow by increasing friction in the duct.
{{term|deep lake water cooling}}
:{{main|Deep lake water cooling}} The heat is rejected to deep lake regions to cool homes and offices, reducing the energy costs.
{{term|ΔT}}
:''(Also '''delta T''')'' a reference to a temperature difference. It is used to describe the difference in temperature of a heating or cooling medium as it enters and as it leaves a system.
{{term|duct}}
:{{main|Duct (HVAC)}} Specialized housing for the air flow.
{{term|dehumidifier}}
:A dehumidifier is the equipment that extracts and removes humidity from the air. It works by cooling air to the point where water turns to liquid from vapor form and then the liquid is removed.
{{term|diffuser}}
:A diffuser is placed over ductwork, and it separates air with vanes going in differing directions. It evenly distributes air flow in the desired directions.
{{term|dry bulb temperature}}
:Dry bulb temperature is the temperature of air measured by a thermometer which is freely exposed to the air while it is shielded from radiation and moisture. It is usually thought of as air temperature, and it is the true thermodynamic temperature. It is a measurement of heat intensity independently of humidity and a dry bulb thermometer is used to measure it.
{{term|dry bulb thermometer}}
:A dry bulb thermometer is a device that measures air temperature independently of humidity. It is freely exposed to the air it is measuring and is protected from the radiation and moisture.
{{term|economizer}}
:{{main|Economizer}} An HVAC component that uses outside air, under suitable climate conditions, to reduce required mechanical cooling. When the outside air’s enthalpy is less than the required supply air during a call for cooling, an economizer allows a building’s mechanical ventilation system to use up to the maximum amount of outside air.
{{term|enthalpy}}
:{{main|Enthalpy}} For a given sample of air, a measure of the total heat content (the sum of the heat energy of the dry air and heat energy of the water vapor within it). It is typically used to determine the amount of fresh outside air that can be added to recirculated air for the lowest cooling cost.
{{term|evaporator}}
:{{main|Evaporator}} A component in the basic refrigeration cycle that absorbs or adds heat to the system. Evaporators can be used to absorb heat from air or from a liquid. The evaporator is the cold side of an air conditioner or heat pump.
{{term|fan coil unit}}
:{{main|Fan coil unit}} A small terminal unit that is often composed of only a blower and a heating and/or cooling coil, as is often used in hotels, condominiums, or apartments. Abbreviated '''FCU'''.
{{term|flow}}
:A transfer of fluid volume per unit time.
{{term|fresh air fan}}
:Abbreviated '''FAF'''. 
{{term|fresh air fraction}}
:Fresh air fraction quantifies action of the economizer, and is defined by (Mass flow rate of fresh-air / Total air flow rate). Abbreviated '''faf'''. 
{{term|fresh air intake}}
:An opening through which outside air is drawn into the building. This may be to replace air in the building that has been exhausted by the ventilation system, or to provide fresh air for combustion of fuel. Abbreviated '''FAI'''.
{{term|furnace}}
:{{main|Furnace}} A component of an HVAC system that adds heat to air or an intermediate fluid by burning fuel (natural gas, oil, propane, butane, or other flammable substances) in a heat exchanger.
{{term|gas furnace heat exchanger}}
:A gas furnace heat exchanger is responsible for the transfer of heat from inside the furnace into the air outside the furnace. The duct system then transfers this exchanged air to different rooms in the building or space.
{{term|grille}}
:A facing across a duct opening, often rectangular in shape, containing multiple parallel slots through which air may be delivered or withdrawn from a ventilated space. The grille directs the air flow in a particular direction and prevents the passage of large items.
{{term|heating coil}}
:A heating coil is the part of the system that conducts heat. It allows electricity to act as fire. 
{{term|heat exchanger}}
:A heat exchanger is the part of the system that transfers heat from the hot parts of the machine or a system to the cold parts of the machine or system.
{{term|heat gain}}
{{term|heat load|multi=y}}
{{term|heat loss|multi=y}}
:Terms for the amount of  cooling (heat gain) or heating (heat loss) needed to maintain desired temperatures and humidities in controlled air. Regardless of how well-insulated and sealed a building is, buildings gain heat from sunlight, conduction through the walls, and internal heat sources such as people and electrical equipment. Buildings lose heat through conduction during cold weather. Engineers use heat load calculations to determine the HVAC needs of the space being cooled or heated.
{{term|heat pump}}
:A heat pump is a compressor that cycles hot or cold air. It is a device that is designed to move thermal energy in the opposite direction of heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space which is released to a warmer space.
{{term|heat transfer}}
:Heat transfer happens when heat moves from one area to another. It is an important and vital step in the process of cooling a space.
{{term|hspf - (Heating Seasonal Performance Factor)}}
:Heating Seasonal Performance Factor is the measurement of heat efficiency over the period of a heating season. 
{{term|industrial refrigerator}}
:{{main|Industrial refrigerator}} An industrial refrigerator is a refrigeration equipment designed for low-temperature processing of food products by creating and maintaining inside the object a specified operating cooling mode, including temperature, humidity, speed for the cooling environment, and sometimes may include pressure and gas composition.
{{term|intermediate fluid}}
:A liquid or gas used to transfer heat between two heat exchangers. An intermediate fluid is used when the hot and cold fluids are too bulky (such as air) or difficult to handle (such as halocarbon refrigerant) to directly transfer the heat.
{{term|louver}}
:1.&amp;nbsp; Components made of multiple smaller blades, sometimes adjustable, placed in ducts or duct entries to control the volume of air flow. When used inside of ducts, their function is similar to that of a '''damper''', but they can be manufactured to fit larger openings than a single-piece damper.
:2.&amp;nbsp; Blades in a rectangular frame placed in doors or walls to permit the movement of air.
{{term|makeup air unit}}
:An air handler that conditions 100% outside air. Typically used in industrial or commercial settings, or in "once-through" (blower sections that only blow air one-way into the building), "low flow" (air handling systems that blow air at a low flow rate), or "primary-secondary" (air handling systems that have an air handler or rooftop unit connected to an add-on makeup unit or hood) commercial HVAC systems. Abbreviated '''MAU'''.
{{term|minimum outside air}}
:The lowest amount of fresh air flow that can be allowed into a recirculating system. This limit is set to ensure that the interior air remains safe and comfortable to breathe.
{{term|outside air damper}}
:An automatic '''louver''' or '''damper''' that controls the fresh air flow into an '''air handler''' and modulates to the most energy efficient setting.
{{term|outside air temperature}}
:A measure of the air temperature outside a building. The temperature and humidity of air inside and outside the building are used in enthalpy calculations to determine when outside air can be used for free heating or cooling. Abbreviated '''OAT'''.
{{term|packaged terminal air conditioner}}
:An air conditioner and heater combined into a single, electrically powered unit, typically installed through a wall and often found in hotels. Abbreviated '''PTAC'''.
{{term|term=packaged unit |content=packaged unit }}
:{{main|Air handler}} An air-handling unit, defined as either "recirculating" or "once-through" design, made specifically for outdoor installation. They most often include, internally, their own heating and cooling devices. Very common in some regions, particularly in single-story commercial buildings. Also called a [[#rooftop unit|rooftop unit (RTU)]]
{{term|plenum space |content=plenum space{{anchor|PLENUM|reason=inbound links|plenum|Plenum}} }}
:{{main|Plenum space}} An enclosed space inside a building or other structure, used for airflow. Often refers to the space between a [[dropped ceiling]] and the structural ceiling, or a [[raised floor]] and the hard floor. Distinct from [[duct (HVAC)|ductwork]] as a plenum is part of the structure itself. [[Plenum cable|Cable]] and piping within a plenum must be properly rated for its fire and smoke indices. See also: [[plenum chamber]]
{{term|psychrometric}}
:{{main|Psychrometrics}} The study of the behavior of air-water vapor mixtures. Water vapor plays an important role in energy transfer and human comfort in HVAC design.
{{term|term=rooftop unit |content=rooftop unit ({{vanchor|RTU}}){{anchor|roof-top unit|roof top unit}} }}
:''Same as [[Air handler]].''
{{term|radiant ceiling panels}}
:Usually metal panels suspended under the ceiling, insulated from the building structure. The primary cooling/heating agent temperature is close to the room's temperature.
{{term|radiant floor}}
:A type of radiant heating system where the building floor contains channels or tubes through which hot fluids such as air or water are circulated. The whole floor is evenly heated. Thus, the room is heated from the bottom up. Radiant floor heating eliminates the draft and dust problems associated with forced air heating systems.
{{term|radiation}}
:The transfer of heat directly from one surface to another (without heating the intermediate air acting as a transfer mechanism).
{{term|SEER}}
:{{main|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio}}
The SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) rating of a unit is the cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period. The higher the unit's SEER rating the more energy efficient it is.
{{term|smoke damper}}
:A '''damper''' or adjustable '''louver''' designed to augment the ventilation of a space during a fire.
{{term|split system}}
:A split system is the combination of an outdoor unit and an indoor unit. This is the most common type of system.
{{term|superheat}}
:The number of degrees a vapor is above its boiling point at a specific pressure.
{{term|subcooling}}
:The condition where liquid refrigerant is colder than the minimum temperature required to keep it from boiling which would change it from a liquid to a gas phase. Subcooling is the difference between its saturation temperature and the actual liquid refrigerant temperature. 
{{term|system}}
:General term used to refer to the set or a subset of components that perform a specific HVAC function within a building.
{{term|terminal unit}}
:A small component that contains a heating coil, cooling coil, automatic damper, or some combination of the three. Used to control the temperature of a single room. Abbreviated '''TU'''.
{{term|thermal zone}}
:An individual space or group of neighboring indoor spaces that the HVAC designer expects will have similar thermal loads. Building codes may require zoning to save energy in commercial buildings. Zones are defined in the building to reduce the number of HVAC subsystems, and thus initial cost. For example, for perimeter offices, rather than one zone for each office, all offices facing west can be combined into one zone. Small residences typically have only one conditioned thermal zone, plus unconditioned spaces such as garages, attics, and crawlspaces, and basements.
{{term|thermostat}}
:A thermostat is a system that monitors and regulates a heating or cooling system. It can be used to set the desired temperature at which it keeps the environment either heated or cooled.
{{term|two-stage (cooling and heating)}}
:A two-stage air conditioner is designed to operate on high and low settings during different weather conditions and seasons. The high setting is used during extreme weather, and the low setting is used during moderate weather. This type of air conditioner produces a balanced temperature and is in use for a longer period of time.
{{term|txv - Thermostatic Expansion Valve}}
:A thermostatic expansion valve is a piece of equipment that meters the flow of liquid refrigerant into the evaporator while measuring the vapor refrigerant leaving the evaporator. It thereby controls the superheating at the outlet of the evaporator.
{{term|underfloor air distribution}} 
:{{main|Underfloor air distribution}} A method for providing ventilation and space conditioning by using the [[#PLENUM|air plenum]] below a [[raised floor]] to distribute conditioned air through diffusers directly to the occupied zone. Abbreviated '''UFAD'''.
{{term|unitary controller}}
:A unitary controller is a device that controls only one zone in a building.
{{term|variable air volume}}
:{{main|Variable air volume}} An HVAC system that has a stable supply-air temperature, and varies the air flow rate to meet the temperature requirements. Compared to '''constant air volume''' systems, these systems conserve energy through lower fan speeds during times of lower temperature control demand. Most new commercial buildings have VAV systems. VAVs may be bypass type or pressure dependent. Pressure dependent type VAVs save energy while both types help in maintaining temperature of the zone that it feeds. Abbreviated '''VAV'''.
{{term|zoning system}}
:A zoning system sections a building or a space into zones which are controlled independently of each other. This is beneficial when different areas or rooms of a building have different temperatures as well as when the desired temperatures in different rooms are different. Temperature is controlled by different thermostats.

'''Henry Ireton''' (1611 – 26 November 1651) was an [[England|English]] general in the [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] army during the [[English Civil War]], the son-in-law of [[Oliver Cromwell]].

==Early life==
Ireton was the eldest son of German Ireton of [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]], [[Nottinghamshire]], and was baptised in [[St. Mary's Church, Attenborough|St Mary's Church]] on 3 November 1611.  He became a [[gentleman commoner]] of [[Trinity College, Oxford]] in 1626, graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1629 and entered the [[Middle Temple]] the same year.

==English Civil War==
On the outbreak of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], he joined the parliamentary army, fighting at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, and at the [[Battle of Gainsborough]] in July 1643. He was made deputy-governor of the [[Isle of Ely]] by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] and served under [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] in the Yorkshire campaign and at the [[Battle of Newbury (1644)|second Battle of Newbury]], afterwards supporting Cromwell in his accusations of incompetency against the Earl.

On the night before the [[Battle of Naseby]], in June 1645, Ireton succeeded in surprising the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] army and captured many prisoners. The next day, on the suggestion of Cromwell, he was made commissary-general and appointed to the command of the left wing, Cromwell himself commanding the right. The wing under Ireton was completely broken by the impetuous charge of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Rupert]] and Ireton was wounded and taken prisoner, but Cromwell charged and successfully routed the Royalists, freeing prisoners including Ireton.

[[File:Bridget Cromwell.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Ireton married [[Bridget Cromwell]] ''(pictured)'', daughter of [[Oliver Cromwell]], during the [[Siege of Oxford]].]]

Ireton was at the siege of [[Bristol]] in September 1645 and took part in the subsequent campaign that succeeded in overthrowing the royal cause. On 30 October 1645 Ireton entered parliament as member for [[Appleby (UK Parliament constituency)|Appleby]]. On 15 June 1646,{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;The Victoria County History gives the date of Ireton's first marriage as January 1647. {{cite book |author=Lobel, Mary D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=[[Victoria County History]]: A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 5: Bullingdon Hundred |year=1957 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=168–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[siege of Oxford]] he married [[Bridget Cromwell]], eldest daughter of Oliver Cromwell. The marriage brought Ireton's career into parallel with Cromwell's.

==Political views and debates over the future of the monarchy==
Ireton was initially a moderate. At the [[Putney Debates]] he opposed extremism, disliked the views of the Republicans and the [[Levellers]], which he considered impractical and dangerous to the foundations of society, and wished to retain the constitution of King, [[House of Lords|Lords]] and [[British House of Commons|Commons]]. He argued for these in the negotiations of the army with Parliament, and in the conferences with the king, being the person chiefly entrusted with the drawing up of the army proposals, including the manifesto called ''"The Heads of the Proposals"'' which proposed a [[constitutional monarchy]]. He tried to prevent the breach between the army and parliament, but when it happened, he supported the negotiations with the king till his actions made him unpopular.

Ireton finally became convinced of the hopelessness of dealing with [[Charles I of England|King Charles]], and, after the king's flight to the [[Isle of Wight]], treated his further proposals with coldness and urged the parliament to establish an administration without him.  Ireton served under [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Baron Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]] in the second civil war in the campaigns, in [[Kent]] and [[Essex, England|Essex]], although it was Fairfax, as Lord General, and not Ireton as is sometimes believed, who was responsible for the executions of Sir [[Charles Lucas]] and Sir [[Sir George Lisle|George Lisle]] at [[Colchester, England|Colchester]].  After the rejection by the king of the last offers of the army, Ireton zealously supported bringing him to trial. He wrote the Army's statement about the regicide—the Remonstrance of the Army—with [[Hugh Peters]]. He was active in the choice to purge rather than reelect Parliament and supported the second Leveller ''[[Agreement of the People]]''. He sat on the king's trial and was one of the commissioners who signed the death warrant.

==Irish campaign and death==
Ireton's regiment was chosen by lot to accompany Cromwell in his [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Irish campaign]]. Ireton arrived in [[Dublin]] two days after Cromwell on 17 August 1649, with 77 ships full of troops and supplies. Ireton was appointed major-general and after the conquest of the south of Ireland, [[Lord President of Munster]]. He went over with [[John Cook (regicide)|John Cook]] with a brief to reform the law of Ireland, to anglicise it, and to make it a model for a new settlement of English law.

In May 1650 Cromwell was recalled to England to command a Parliamentary force preparing to invade [[Scotland]], and Ireton assumed command of the [[New Model Army]] in Ireland with the title and powers of [[Lord Deputy of Ireland|Lord Deputy]] to complete the conquest of the country. This he proceeded to do, becoming noted as much by the savagery of his methods as for his military skill. By the middle of 1650 Ireton and his commanders faced two problems. One was the capture of the remaining cities held by the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate]] and Royalists forces. The other was an escalating [[guerrilla war]] in the countryside as Irish fighters called [[rapparees|tories]] attacked his supply lines. Ireton appealed to the English Parliament to publish lenient surrender terms for Irish Catholics, in order to end their resistance, but this was refused.

His first action after the refusal was to mount a counter-guerrilla expedition into the [[Wicklow Mountains]] early in June 1650, in order to secure his lines of supply for the [[Siege of Waterford]] in Ireland's southeast. Ireton then blockaded [[Waterford]] into surrender by August 1650. Ireton systematically constructed trenches to bring his siege guns within range of the walls and stationed a Parliamentary fleet off the city to prevent its re-supply. [[Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara|Thomas Preston]] surrendered Waterford after a three-month siege. Ireton then advanced to [[Limerick]] by October, but had to call off the siege due to cold and bad weather. Early in 1651 Ireton ordered that areas harbouring the guerrillas should be systematically stripped of food – a [[scorched earth]] policy that caused a [[famine]] in Ireland by the end of the year. Ireton returned to Limerick in June 1651 and [[siege of Limerick (1650-51)|besieged the city]] for five months until it surrendered in October 1651. At the same time, [[Galway]] was [[Siege of Galway|under siege]] by Parliamentarian forces, and Ireton rode to inspect the command of [[Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath|Charles Coote]], who was blockading that city. The physical strain of his command took hold on Ireton, however, and he fell ill.

After the capture of Limerick, Ireton had dignitaries of Limerick hanged for their defence of the city, including an [[Alderman]], Bishop (Turlough O'Brien) [[Terence Albert O'Brien]] and an English Royalist officer, Colonel Fennell. He also wanted the Irish commander, [[Hugh Dubh O'Neill]] hanged, but [[Edmund Ludlow]] cancelled the order after Ireton's death.

Ireton fell ill of the plague that was raging through the town, and died on 26 November. His loss reportedly "struck a great sadness into Cromwell" and he was considered a great loss to the administration. There are various anecdotes about his demise from Irish ecclesiastical and English royalist sources. Thus, his death has been depicted as divine punishment for the execution of Bishop O'Brien, who prior to his death had called upon Ireton to answer at God's judgment seat for his murders; the Hibernica Dominicana claims that on his death bed Ireton was  "privately muttering to himself 'I never gave the aid of my counsel towards the murder of that bishop; never, never; it was the council of war did it… I wish I had never seen this popish bishop'." &lt;ref&gt;The Death of Oliver Cromwell by HF McMains&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Philip Warwick]] stated that among Ireton's last words were "blood! blood! I must have more blood!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_zQFAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=Blood%20blood&amp;f=false |title=Duffy's Hibernian magazine - Google Livres |via=[[Google Books]] |date= |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

At Ireton's funeral, in [[Westminster Abbey]],&lt;ref name=bcw&gt;[http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/ireton.htm] Biography English Civil Wars&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Watson (officer of arms)|John Watson]] and others wore new tabards that replaced the royal arms with the new arms of the commonwealth.&lt;ref name=Stanford1953&gt;H. Stanford London, 'The Heralds' Tabards under the Commonwealth', ''Notes and Queries'', Vol.198, 1953, p. 276-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous execution==
On 30 January 1661, following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the English monarchy of 1660, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] had Ireton's corpse exhumed from Westminster and mutilated in a [[posthumous execution]], along with those of [[Oliver Cromwell's head|Cromwell]] and [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]], in retribution for signing his father's death warrant. The date was symbolic, being the 12th anniversary of the execution of Charles I.

==Family==
By his wife, Bridget Cromwell, Ireton left one son, [[Henry Ireton (died 1711)|Henry Ireton]] (c.1652–1711),&lt;ref&gt;Hayton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=szhX3P6NUFMC&amp;lpg=PA469&amp;ots=CmNM0IKqo3&amp;dq=Ireton%20Rye%20House%20Plot&amp;pg=PA468#v=onepage&amp;q=Ireton%20Rye%20House%20Plot&amp;f=false pp. 468,469]&lt;/ref&gt; and four daughters, one of whom, [[Bridget Bendish]] (she married Thomas Bendish in 1670) is said to have compromised herself in the [[Rye House Plot]] of 1683, as did Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bendish (1643–1707) was the younger son of [[Sir Thomas Bendish, 2nd Baronet]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ireton's widow Bridget afterwards married General [[Charles Fleetwood]]. Another daughter Elizabeth married Thomas Polhill, their son was [[David Polhill]].

==In fiction==
In the 1970 film ''[[Cromwell (film)|Cromwell]]'' starring [[Richard Harris]] and [[Alec Guinness]], [[Michael Jayston]] plays Ireton as a subtle but well-meaning manipulator who hates Charles I and pushes Cromwell into actions which Cromwell at first considers neither desirable nor possible but then pursues all the way. This version of Ireton is ready to denounce the King and plunge England into civil war before Cromwell becomes convinced that this is a necessary step. In the film, he and Cromwell are also among the five members whom Charles I attempts to arrest on the eve of the war (when in fact they were not) and, after the King is executed, is upbraided by Cromwell as being too ambitious. There is no mention in the film of Ireton marrying Cromwell's daughter.

Ireton is portrayed as a minor character in [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s 1953 [[historical fiction]] novel ''[[Simon (novel)|Simon]]''.

Ireton is the main character in John Attenborough's 1987 historical fiction novel ''Destiny Our Choice'', which gives a generally positive view of Ireton, claiming that he was influential in saving the life of [[Hugh Dubh O'Neill|Hugh O'Neill]] after the [[Siege of Limerick (1650–51)|Siege of Limerick]] in 1650-51.

==Memorials==
The town of [[Ireton, Iowa]] was named after Henry Ireton.

Ireton Road in [[Colchester]] was named after Henry Ireton. Ireton Road adjoins Honywood Road, named after Sir [[Thomas Honywood]] who led the Essex forces at the [[Siege of Colchester]] under the command of [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]].
Ireton Road in [[Market Harborough]] was named after Henry Ireton.
Ireton Way is now a very straight part of the A142 between Ely and Chatteris, built by him when he was commanding East Anglian forces as a causeway across the flooded Fens around the Ouse river to rush troops and supplies over when resisting Royalist attack from Lincolnshire and the Midlands.
His portrait continues to hang in the dining hall of Trinity College, Oxford.

'''''A Course of Legal Study, addressed to Students, and the Profession generally''''' is a book by David Hoffman.

In 1847, [[John Gage Marvin|J G Marvin]] said:

{{Blockquote|What [[Cujacius]] said of [[Paul de Castro]], has been appropriately applied to Professor Hoffman's Course of Legal Study; ''qui non habet Paulum de Castro, tunicam vendat, el tmat''. The author is well known as a learned and able jurist, who has long laboured as an instructor and writer, in disseminating proper views upon legal education, and in elevating its standard in the United States. From his long experience in these matters, and varied learning, he was able to write a work of peculiar excellence, worthy of the approval of a liberal profession, and a priceless contribution to young men just starting upon the life-long study of the law. It not only points out the authors to be read in each department of the law, but those which should be studied in connexion with the law, to form the accomplished jurist. Judge Story remarks, that "the writers whom he recommends are of the very best authority; and his own notes are composed in a tone of the most enlarged philosophy, and abound in just and discriminating criticism, and in precepts calculated to elevate the moral as well as intellectual character of the Profession." It is truly a bibliographical treasure, that none will do without who are in downright earnest in studying the law as a liberal profession. My own humble labours in [[legal bibliography]], have been greatly aided by this excellent writer, as every person's will be who gives the subject any attention. It is written in a fresh and glowing style, evincing the deep interest the author takes in his subject, and its perusal does not fail to awaken a responsive feeling, and an ardent desire to master the most noble of sciences, the stepping stone to usefulness and honour, the law. 6 N.

The '''German Foundation for International Legal Cooperation (Deutsche Stiftung für Internationale Rechtliche Zusammenarbeit e.V.''' or IRZ) was set up in 1992 on the initiative of the German Federal Minister of Justice, Dr. [[Klaus Kinkel]], as a registered non-profit association. Its headquarters are in Bonn, with an additional office in Berlin.

== Tasks ==
The IRZ works with institutions involved in legal and judicial reform in almost 30 partner states. This cooperation covers the states of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeast Europe|South-East Europe]], the [[MENA]] region and the [[Transcaucasia|South Caucasus]], [[central Asia]] and [[Vietnam]].

Within the framework of providing advice on legislation, the IRZ organises expert discussions, helps with the development of draft legislation and promotes the continued training and education of law professionals from all kinds of disciplines. To this end, seminars, workshops and conferences are organised in the relevant partner states. The main focus here is on national legal reforms and German and [[European Union law|European law]]. Working visits, work placements and job shadowing are also made available in Germany for training and education purposes, allowing a direct, practice-oriented exchange of experiences with German experts. The IRZ also does everything it can to support law students by working with universities, providing supplementary studies, seminars and lectures.

The IRZ is supported and assisted by its members and the [[Board of Trustees|board of trustees]]. These include personalities from the worlds of politics, business, management, academia and legal associations and companies. The IRZ can also rely on support from numerous other experienced experts from a wide variety of specialist areas of the law. This means that the IRZ can guarantee specialist expert advice and non-bureaucratic, fast, flexible and coordinated support over the long term for its partner states.

== Objectives ==
Together with its partners, the IRZ develops and consolidates:
* Rule-of-law, democratic constitutional structures within the framework of the European approach to human rights
* An independent, operational judiciary including all the foundations for procedural law
* The private and commercial legal foundations for private law activities and business transactions
* The public law framework conditions for corporate activities 
* The harmonisation of national legal systems with European law
* International [[Judicial assistance|legal assistance]] and cooperation in civil and criminal cases
* European standards, in particular for protecting human rights in [[criminal law]], [[Criminal Procedure Law|criminal procedural law]] and [[Corrections|penitentiary law]]

== Contracting authority ==
The IRZ is commissioned by the [[Cabinet of Germany|German Federal Government]] and is therefore primarily financed by the budget of the [[Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection|German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection]] and by project funding from the [[Federal Foreign Office|German Federal Foreign Office]]. The IRZ also carries out projects as part of the [[European Union]] Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations.

==Background==
The bill was passed in the budget session of 2000 and signed by President [[K. R. Narayanan]] on 9 May 2000.

==Summary==
The original Act contained 94 sections, divided in 13 chapters and 4 [[schedule]]s. The laws apply to the whole of India.

After the Section 66A was repealed on 24 March, the state government said that they would continue the prosecution under the remaining charges.&lt;ref name=AzamKhan&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen arrested for Facebook post attributed to Azam Khan gets bail|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Teen-arrested-for-Facebook-post-attributed-to-Azam-Khan-gets-bail/articleshow/46620033.cms|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UPtellsSC&gt;{{cite news|title=UP tells SC that prosecution on boy for post against Azam Khan will continue|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/up-tells-sc-that-prosecution-on-boy-for-post-against-azam-khan-will-continue/|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Section 66A and restriction of free speech===
From its establishment as an amendment to the original act in 2008, Section 66A attracted controversy over its unconstitutional nature:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Section!! Offence !! Description !!Penalty
|-
| 66A
| Publishing offensive, false or threatening information 
| Any person who sends by any means of a computer resource any information that is grossly offensive or has a menacing character; or any information which he knows to be false, but for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with fine.
| Imprisonment up to three years, with fine.
|-
|}

In December 2012, [[P Rajeev]], a [[Rajya Sabha]] member from Kerala, tried to pass a resolution seeking to amend the Section 66A. He was supported by D. Bandyopadhyay, [[Gyan Prakash Pilania]], [[Basavaraj Patil Sedam]], Narendra Kumar Kashyap, Rama Chandra Khuntia and [[Baishnab Charan Parida]]. P Rajeev pointed that cartoons and editorials  allowed in traditional media, were being censored in the new media. He also said that law was barely debated before being passed in December 2008.&lt;ref name=Undemocratic/&gt;

[[Rajeev Chandrasekhar]] suggested the 66A should only apply to person to person communication pointing to a similar section under the Indian Post Office Act, 1898. [[Shantaram Naik]] opposed any changes, saying that the misuse of law was sufficient to warrant changes. Then [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology|Minister for Communications and Information Technology]] [[Kapil Sibal]] defended the existing law, saying that similar laws existed in US and UK. He also said that a similar provision existed under Indian Post Office Act, 1898. However, P Rajeev said that the UK dealt only with communication from person to person.&lt;ref name=Undemocratic&gt;{{cite news|title=Section 66A of IT Act undemocratic: RS MPs|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Section-66A-of-IT-Act-undemocratic-RS-MPs/articleshow/17623782.cms|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Petitions challenging constitutionality====

In November 2012, IPS officer Amitabh Thakur and his wife social activist Nutan Thakur, filed a petition in the [[Lucknow]] bench of the [[Allahabad High Court]] claiming that the Section 66A violated the freedom of speech guaranteed in the Article 19(1)(a) of the [[Constitution of India]]. They said that the section was vague and frequently misused.&lt;ref name=UltraVires&gt;{{cite news|title=After Mumbai FB case, writ filed in Lucknow to declare section 66A, IT Act 2000 as ultra-vires|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/social-media/After-Mumbai-FB-case-writ-filed-in-Lucknow-to-declare-section-66A-IT-Act-2000-as-ultra-vires/articleshow/17310326.cms?referral=PM|accessdate=14 April 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in November 2012, a Delhi-based law student, [[Shreya Singhal]], filed a [[Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL) in the Supreme Court of India. She argued that the Section 66A was vaguely phrased, as result it violated Article 14, 19 (1)(a) and Article 21 of the Constitution. The PIL was accepted on 29 November 2012.&lt;ref name=PIL66A&gt;{{cite news|title=SC accepts PIL challenging Section 66A of IT Act|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-accepts-PIL-challenging-Section-66A-of-IT-Act/articleshow/17412246.cms|accessdate=23 April 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shreya&gt;{{cite news|title=Shreya Singhal: The student who took on India's internet laws|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32036574|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar petition was also filed by the founder of [[MouthShut.com]], [[Faisal Farooqui]],&lt;ref name=HeavensFall&gt;{{cite news|title='Heavens Won't Fall' if Controversial Parts of IT Act are Stayed, Says Supreme Court|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/heavens-wont-fall-if-controversial-parts-of-it-act-are-stayed-says-supreme-court-708522|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[NDTV]]|date=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NGO Common Cause represented by [[Prashant Bhushan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newslaundry.com/2015/03/24/the-heroes-in-the-battle-against-section-66a/|title=Newslaundry - Sabki Dhulai|first=|last=Newslaundry|date=|website=newslaundry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2014, the Supreme Court asked the central government to respond to petitions filed by [[Mouthshut.com]] and later petition filed by the [[Internet and Mobile Association of India]] (IAMAI) which claimed that the IT Act gave the government power to arbitrarily remove user-generated content.&lt;ref name=SCSeeksReply&gt;{{cite news|title=SC seeks govt reply on PIL challenging powers of IT Act|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/DSjZ9XsezZ4fN2GGfkWu1N/SC-seeks-govt-reply-on-PIL-challenging-powers-of-IT-Act.html|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[Live Mint]]|date=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Revocation by the Supreme Court====

On 24 March 2015, the Supreme Court of India, gave the verdict that Section 66A is unconstitutional in entirety. The court said that Section 66A of IT Act 2000 is "arbitrarily, excessively and disproportionately invades the right of free speech" provided under [[Fundamental rights in India|Article 19(1)]] of the [[Constitution of India]]. But the Court turned down a plea to strike down sections 69A and 79 of the Act, which deal with the procedure and safeguards for blocking certain websites. &lt;ref name=Draconian&gt;{{cite news|title=SC strikes down ‘draconian’ Section 66A|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-strikes-down-section-66-a-of-the-it-act-finds-it-unconstitutional/article7027375.ece|accessdate=23 April 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KeyPoints&gt;{{cite news|title=SC quashes Section 66A of IT Act: Key points of court verdict|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-quashes-Section66A-IT-Act/listshow/46673677.cms|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strict data privacy rules===
The [[data privacy]] rules introduced in the Act in 2011 have been described as too strict by some Indian and US firms. The rules require firms to obtain written permission from customers before collecting and using their personal data. This has affected US firms which outsource to Indian companies. However, some companies have welcomed the strict rules, saying it will remove fears of outsourcing to Indian companies.&lt;ref name=StrictData&gt;{{cite news|title=India data privacy rules may be too strict for some U.S. companies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/india-data-privacy-rules-may-be-too-strict-for-some-us-companies/2011/05/18/AF9QJc8G_story.html|accessdate=23 April 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mandatory decryption===
{{See also|Mandatory decryption}}
The Section 69 allows intercepting any information and ask for information decryption. To refuse decryption is an offence. The [[Indian Telegraph Act, 1885]] allows the government to tap phones. But, according to a 1996 Supreme Court verdict the government can tap phones only in case of a "public emergency". But, there is no such restriction on Section 69.&lt;ref name=Snooping/&gt;

==Future changes==
On 2 April 2015, the Chief Minister of [[Maharashtra]], [[Devendra Fadnavis]] revealed to the state assembly that a new law was being framed to replace the repealed Section 66A. Fadnavis was replying to a query [[Shiv Sena]] leader Neelam Gorhe. Gorhe had said that repeal of the law would encourage online miscreants and asked whether the state government would frame a law to this regard. Fadnavis said that the previous law had resulted in no convictions, so the law would be framed such that it would be strong and result in convictions.&lt;ref name=NewLaw66A&gt;{{cite news|title=Centre working on new law similar to Section 66A: Devendra Fadnavis|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/social/Centre-working-on-new-law-similar-to-Section-66A-Devendra-Fadnavis/articleshow/46780443.cms|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2015, it announced that the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] would form a committee of officials from the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], [[National Investigation Agency]], [[Delhi Police]] and ministry itself to produce a new legal framework. This step was reportedly taken after complaints from intelligence agencies that, they were no longer able to counter online posts that involved national security matter or incite people to commit an offence, such as online recruitment for [[ISIS]].&lt;ref name=SofterSec66A&gt;{{cite news|title=Section 66A of the IT Act likely to be back in softer avatar|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-04-14/news/61142309_1_social-media-posts-shreya-singhal-ministry-official|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewPanel&gt;{{cite news|title=New panel to work on Section 66A alternative|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-panel-to-work-on-sec-66a-alternative/article1-1336917.aspx|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Minister of State with the Ministry of Information Technology, [[Milind Deora]] has supported a new "unambiguous section to replace 66A".&lt;ref name=Deora&gt;{{cite news|title=Former IT minister Milind Deora: Why we need a new Section 66A|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/column/former-it-minister-milind-deora-why-we-need-a-new-section-66a/20150402.htm|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[Rediff]]|date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism''' was adopted by the member countries of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) at its [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|General Assembly]]  held in [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]], on 3 June 2002. The Convention, negotiated pursuant to a mandate from the OAS Foreign Ministers shortly after the terrorist attacks of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|11 September 2001]] in the [[United States]], reflects the [[Americas]]' hemispheric-wide commitment to enhancing cooperation in the fight against [[terrorism]].

In brief, the Convention:
*Improves regional cooperation in the fight against terrorism, thereby enhancing hemispheric security.
*Commits parties to endeavor to sign and ratify the relevant U.N. anti-terrorism instruments (a major element in [[U.N. Security Council Resolution 1373]]).
*Commits parties to use the recommendations of the [[Financial Action Task Force]] (FATF) and other specialized entities as guidelines in taking measures to prevent, combat and eradicate the financing of terrorism.
*Denies safe haven to suspected terrorists, both as refugees and asylum-seekers, and denies use of the [[political offense exception]] by suspected terrorists to prevent extradition or rendering of mutual legal assistance.
*Extends the terrorist acts covered under the relevant U.N. anti-terrorism instruments to [[financial crimes]] (e.g., money laundering) and other provisions of the U.N.'s [[Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime]]. The OAS Convention thus elaborates for regional use a variety of legal tools that have proven effective against [[transnational organized crime]] in recent years.
*Enhances cooperation in a number of areas, including: exchanges of information on border control measures and law enforcement actions; appointment of a single national point of contact as liaison with other states and relevant bodies; exchanges of experience and training; technical assistance; and mutual legal assistance.
*Demonstrates regional solidarity in fight against terrorism.
*Facilitates the implementation of a number of the mandates in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1373 and expands the signatory states' ability to act upon some of the recommendations set forth in the Resolution.

{{As of|2007|alt=To date}}, the Convention has been signed by 33 of the 34 active member states and ratified by 24.

Convention oversight is the task of the OAS's '''Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism'''.

'''Joseph Henry Beale''' (October 12, 1861 – January 20, 1943) was an [[Americans|American]] [[law professor]] at [[Harvard Law School]] and served as the first dean of [[University of Chicago Law School]].  He was notable for his advancement of [[legal formalism]], as well as his work in Conflict of Laws, Corporations, and Criminal Law.&lt;ref name=HLR56&gt;Williston, Samuel, "Joseph Henry Beale: A Biographical Sketch", 56 Harvard Law Review No. 5, p. 685&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Beale was born in the neighborhood of [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]] in Boston, Massachusetts.  He attended [[Harvard University]] as an undergraduate, distinguishing himself in classics and mathematics.  He graduated fifth in his class in 1882.&lt;ref name=HLR56 /&gt;

He studied law at [[Harvard Law School]].  Upon graduation, he declined an offer to clerk for the [[United States Supreme Court]], and opened his own practice.&lt;ref&gt;Williston, Samuel, "Joseph Henry Beale: A Biographical Sketch",56 Harvard Law Review No. 5, p. 686&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and academic career==
Beale worked for several years in his own practice, authoring or co-authoring several treatises during this time, including an influential treatise on [[damages]].  Based upon the reputation of this treatise, Beale was offered the post of assistant professor at [[Harvard Law School]] in 1892.

During his career at Harvard Law School, Beale was a renowned and influential legal scholar.&lt;ref name=HLR56 /&gt; One of Beale's most famous works of scholarship was his 1916 essay entitled "The Nature of Law" which appeared in the treatise "Treatise on the Conflict of Laws."  Beale was best known, along with [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]], as an influential proponent of the model of legal thought known as [[legal formalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher, "The Philosophy of Law", Taylor and Francis (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard Law School]] awards the Joseph H. Beale prize to the student who obtains the highest grade during the academic year in the course on Conflict of Laws.

In 1902, at the request of [[William Rainey Harper]], first President of the [[University of Chicago]], for assistance from Harvard's faculty in setting up a law school at Chicago, Beale was "lent" by Harvard to become the first dean of the [[University of Chicago Law School]].  During his two-year tenure (a leave of absence from Harvard), Beale hired numerous faculty and established Chicago's law school as "one of the best in the country," garnering Beale honorary degrees from Chicago and the University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;Williston, Samuel, "Joseph Henry Beale: A Biographical Sketch",56 Harvard Law Review No. 5, p. 687-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Chicago continues to award the Joseph Henry Beale prize for outstanding performance in legal research and writing to first-year students every year.&lt;ref&gt;University of Chicago Law School, The Bigelow Program, available at: http://www.law.uchicago.edu/prospectives/bigelow&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beale retired from teaching in 1938.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="769">'''Jus scriptum''' or '''ius scriptum''' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for "written law". The [[Roman law]]yers saw this law as a law issued by public authorities with legislative function. Such law was typically redacted in writing. In later Roman law and in present-day law written laws (''leges'') which are made by legislative organs of a state predicted by a constitution are considered ''jus scriptum''.{{sfn|Horvat|1998|p=7}}

'''''Keech v Metropolitan Health Service''''' was a [[court case]] decided in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] in which the exemption relating to acts of a State or Territory contained within the [[Age Discrimination Act 2004]] was considered.

==The case==
The applicant, Keech, was injured at work at the age of 66. RiskCover, the insurance company of the [[King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women|Metropolitan Health Service]], accepted [[public liability|liability]] and paid [[Workers' compensation|compensation]] under the ''Workers’ Compensation and Injury Management Act 1981 (WA)'' (the WA Act). The WA Act provided different schemes of payment whereby workers injured before attaining the age of 64 would be entitled to compensation until they turned 65, and workers injured after attaining this age would be entitled to compensation for a year after the date of the injury.

Keech argued that by paying her compensation for the period prescribed by the WA Act, the Metropolitan Health Service had treated her less favourably than a younger employee who incurred a workplace injury at the same time as she did. She also argued that the conduct of the Metropolitan Health Service was not exempt from the Age Discrimination Act as it was not in direct compliance with the WA Act - that is, the WA Act prescribed a date at which entitlements to compensation could cease, but it did not oblige employers to stop paying at this time.

==The decision==
[[Antony Siopis|Siopis J]] considered that the Metropolitan Health Service's conduct was unlikely to constitute [[age discrimination]] but found it unnecessary to finally determine this issue, because in any case they had directly complied with the WA Act. His Honour interpreted the WA Act as imposing an obligation on employers to pay compensation for a prescribed period and the respondent had directly complied with this requirement. As such, the employer's conduct was exempt from the Age Discrimination Act.

{{World homosexuality laws map}}{{LGBT rights at the UN}}
Laws affecting [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people vary greatly by country or territory — encompassing everything from the legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]] to the [[death penalty for homosexuality]].

Laws that affect LGBT people include, but are not limited to, the following:

* laws concerning the recognition of [[same-sex relationship]]s, including [[same-sex marriage]], [[civil union]]s, and [[domestic partnership]]s
* laws concerning [[LGBT parenting]], including [[LGBT adoption|adoption by LGBT people]]
* [[anti-discrimination laws]] in employment, housing, education, public accommodations
* [[anti-bullying legislation]] to protect LGBT children at school
* [[hate crime laws]] imposing enhanced criminal penalties for prejudice-motivated [[violence against LGBT people]]
* [[bathroom bill]]s affecting access to sex-segregated facilities by transgender people
* laws related to [[sexual orientation and military service]]
* laws concerning access to [[assisted reproductive technology]]
* [[sodomy laws]] that penalize consensual same-sex sexual activity
* [[age of consent]] laws that may impose higher ages for same-sex sexual activity
* laws regarding [[MSM blood donor controversy|donation of blood by men who have sex with men]]
* laws concerning access to [[sex reassignment surgery]] and [[hormone replacement therapy (transgender)|hormone replacement therapy]]
* [[Legal aspects of transgenderism|legal recognition and accommodation of reassigned gender]]

Notably, 25 countries, all of which being developed democracies or developing democracies, recognized [[same-sex marriage]] as of 2018. By contrast, 10 countries or jurisdictions, all of which are Islamic and ruled by [[sharia]], were imposing the [[death penalty for homosexuality]].

In 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights, following which the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] issued a report documenting violations of the rights of LGBT people, including [[hate crime]]s, criminalization of [[homosexuality|homosexual activity]], and [[discrimination]]. Following the issuance of the report, the [[United Nations]] urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBT rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.N. council passes gay rights resolution|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/06/17/un.lgbt.rights/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=Jill Dougherty|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN issues first report on human rights of gay and lesbian people|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40743|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=December 15, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Celts===
According to [[Aristotle]], although most "belligerent nations" were strongly influenced by their women, the Celts were unusual because their men openly preferred male lovers (''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' II 1269b).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Percy |first=William A. |title=Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1996 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=TCvoj1efp8UC&amp;pg=PA18 |page=18 |isbn=0-252-06740-1 |accessdate=2009-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rankin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rankin |first1=David |last2=Ranking |first2=H.D. |title=Celts and the Classical World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdqk4vXqntgC&amp;pg=PA55 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-4151-5090-3 |pages=55 and 78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; H. D. Rankin in ''Celts and the Classical World'' notes that "Athenaeus echoes this comment (603a) and so does [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] (30.9). It seems to be the general opinion of antiquity."&lt;ref name="Rankin"/&gt; In book XIII of his ''[[Deipnosophistae|Deipnosophists]]'', the Roman Greek rhetorician and grammarian [[Athenaeus]], repeating assertions made by [[Diodorus Siculus]] in the 1st century BC (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' 5:32), wrote that Celtic women were beautiful but that the men preferred to sleep together. Diodorus went further, stating that "the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused". Rankin argues that the ultimate source of these assertions is likely to be [[Poseidonius]] and speculates that these authors may be recording "some kind of bonding ritual ... which requires abstinence from women at certain times".&lt;ref name="Rankin"/&gt;

===Ancient India===
Throughout [[Hindu]] and [[Vedic]] texts there are many descriptions of saints, demigods, and even the Supreme Lord transcending gender norms and manifesting multiple combinations of sex and gender.&lt;ref&gt;ritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; There are several instances in ancient   [[Indian epic poetry]] of same sex depictions and unions by gods and goddesses. There are several stories depicting love between those of the same sex, especially among kings and queens. [[Kamasutra]], the ancient [[Ancient India|Indian]] treatise on love talks about feelings for same sexes. [[Transsexuals]] are also venerated e.g. [[Lord Vishnu]] as [[Mohini]] and [[Lord Shiva]] as [[Ardhanarishwara]] (which means half woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://galva108.org/deities.html |title=Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association, Inc |publisher=[[The Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association]] |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063544/http://galva108.org/deities.html |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient West Asia===

====Ancient Israel====
The ancient [[Law of Moses]] (the [[Torah]]) forbids men lying with men (intercourse) in Leviticus 18 and gives a story of attempted homosexual rape in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], the cities being soon destroyed after that. The death penalty was prescribed. In Deuteronomy 22:5, cross-dressing is condemned as being "abominable".

====Ancient Persia====
In Persia homosexuality and homoerotic expressions were tolerated in numerous public places, from monasteries and seminaries to taverns, military camps, bathhouses, and coffee houses. In the early [[Safavids|Safavid]] era (1501–1723), male houses of [[prostitution]] (''amrad khane'') were legally recognized and paid taxes. Persian poets, such as [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]] (d. 1291), [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] (d. 1389), and [[Jami]] (d. 1492), wrote poems replete with homoerotic allusions. The two most commonly documented forms were commercial sex with transgender young males or males enacting transgender roles exemplified by the [[köçek]]s and [[Sufi]] spiritual practices in which the practitioner admired the form of a beautiful boy in order to enter ecstatic states and glimpse the beauty of God.

====Assyria====
In [[Assyria]]n society, [[sex crime]]s were punished identically whether they were homosexual or heterosexual.&lt;ref name="Nissinen"&gt;Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective, by Martti Nissinen, Fortress Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHSNPG85tUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage p. 24–28]&lt;/ref&gt; An individual faced no punishment for penetrating someone of equal [[social class]], a cult prostitute, or with someone whose [[gender role]]s were not considered solidly masculine.&lt;ref name="Nissinen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies, by James Neill, McFarland, 27 Oct 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage p.83]&lt;/ref&gt; Such sexual relations were even seen as good [[Luck|fortune]], with an [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian tablet]], the ''[[Šumma ālu]]'', reading, "If a man copulates with his equal from the rear, he becomes the leader among his peers and brothers".&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RKhFRgR-1awC&amp;q=equal+basis#v=onepage ''The Construction of Homosexuality'', authored by David Greenberg, University of Chicago Press, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epistle.us/hbarticles/neareast.html|title=Homosexuality in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt by Bruce Gerig    in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt|website=epistle.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, homosexual relationships with fellow soldiers, slaves, royal attendants, or those where a social better was [[Top, bottom and versatile|submissive or penetrated]], were treated as bad [[omens]].&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay Rights Or Wrongs: A Christian's Guide to Homosexual Issues and Ministry, by Mike Mazzalonga, 1996, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle Assyrian [[Assyrian law|Law Codes]] dating 1075 BC has a particularly harsh law for [[Sexual orientation and military service|homosexuality in the military]], which reads: "If a man have intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a eunuch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halsall|first1=Paul|title=The Code of the Assura|url=https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.asp|website=[[Internet History Sourcebooks Project]]|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=[[Fordham University]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230918/http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.asp|archivedate=11 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homosexuality, Erik Holland page 334"&gt;The Nature Of Homosexuality, Erik Holland, page 334, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRjGApZVwPIC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=Code%20of%20the%20Assura%20homosexulaity|title=Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar law code reads, "If a seignior lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a [[eunuch]]". This law code condemns a situation that involves homosexual [[rape]]. Any Assyrian male could visit a [[prostitute]] or lie with another male, just as long as false rumors or forced sex were not involved with another male.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Driver and J. C. Miles, The Assyrian Laws (Oxford, Clarendon Press [1935]), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
The "conquest mentality" of the [[ancient Romans]] shaped [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Roman homosexual practices]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. xi; Marilyn B. Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Republic]], a [[Roman citizenship|citizen]]'s political liberty was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion or use by others;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; for the male citizen to submit his body to the giving of pleasure was considered servile.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; As long as a man played the penetrative role, it was socially acceptable and considered natural for him to have [[Pathicus|same-sex relations]], without a perceived loss of his [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|masculinity or social standing]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225, and "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits, and the ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia'' 288a; Thomas Habinek, "The Invention of Sexuality in the World-City of Rome," in ''The Roman Cultural Revolution'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 39; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 545–546. Scholars disagree as to whether the ''Lex Scantinia'' imposed the death penalty or a hefty fine.&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptable same-sex partners were males excluded from legal protections as citizens: [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], male [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]], and the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'', entertainers or others who might be technically free but whose lifestyles set them outside the law.

"Homosexual" and "heterosexual" were thus not categories of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Roman sexuality]], and no words exist in [[Latin]] that would precisely translate these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, ''Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome'' (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; A male citizen who willingly performed [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|oral sex]] or received [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Anal sex|anal sex]] was disparaged, but there is only limited evidence of legal penalties against these men, who were presumably "homosexual" in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 214–215; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In courtroom and political rhetoric, charges of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Effeminacy and transvestism|effeminacy]] and passive sexual behaviors were directed particularly at "democratic" politicians ''([[populares]])'' such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Mark Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, ''The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] addressed the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#The rape of men|rape of a male citizen]] as early as the 2nd century BC, when a ruling was issued in a case that may have involved a man of same-sex orientation. It was ruled that even a man who was "disreputable and questionable" had the same right as other citizens not to have his body subjected to forced sex.&lt;ref&gt;As recorded in a fragment of the speech ''De Re Floria'' by [[Cato the Elder]] (frg. 57 Jordan = [[Aulus Gellius]] 9.12.7), noted and discussed by Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; A law probably dating to the [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] of Julius Caesar defined rape as forced sex against "boy, woman, or anyone"; the rapist was subject to execution, a rare penalty in Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 562–563. See also ''Digest'' 48.5.35 [34] on legal definitions of rape that included boys.&lt;/ref&gt; A male classified as ''infamis'', such as a prostitute or actor, could not as a matter of law be raped, nor could a slave, who was legally classified as property; the slave's owner, however, could prosecute the rapist for property damage.&lt;ref&gt;Under the ''[[Lex Aquilia]]''. See McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality, and the Law in Ancient Rome'', p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman army]] of the Republic, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex in the military|sex among fellow soldiers]] violated the decorum against intercourse with citizens and was subject to harsh penalties, including death,&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; as a violation of [[military discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;Sara Elise Phang, ''Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek historian [[Polybius]] (2nd century BC) lists [[desertion|deserters]], thieves, [[perjury|perjurers]], and "those who in youth have abused their persons" as subject to the ''[[fustuarium]]'', clubbing to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]], ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html#37 6.37.9] (translated as [[bastinado]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources are most concerned with the effects of [[sexual harassment]] by officers, but the young soldier who brought an accusation against his superior needed to show that he had not willingly taken the passive role or prostituted himself.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', pp. 280–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers were free to have [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|relations with their male slaves]];&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of a fellow citizen-soldier's body was prohibited, not homosexual behaviors per se.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 112 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late Republic and throughout the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], there is increasing evidence that men whose lifestyle marked them as "homosexual" in the modern sense served openly.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=jyFdUxqYZ48C&amp;pg=PA285#v=onepage&amp;q=%22more%20tolerant%20of%20homosexual%20relations%20between%20soldiers%22 pp. 285–292.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Roman law did not recognize marriage between men, and in general Romans regarded marriage as a heterosexual union with the primary purpose of producing children, in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating [[Marriage in ancient Rome|traditional marriage rites]]. [[Juvenal]] remarks with disapproval that his friends often attended such ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''Satire'' 2; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Nero]] had two marriages to men, once as the bride (with a [[freedman]] [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]]) and once as the groom. His consort [[Sporus]] appeared in public as Nero's wife wearing the regalia that was customary for the Roman empress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]] ''Life of Nero'' 28–29; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 279ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from measures to protect the prerogatives of citizens, the prosecution of homosexuality as a general crime began in the 3rd century of the Christian era when male prostitution was banned by [[Philip the Arab]]. By the end of the 4th century, after the [[Roman Empire]] had come under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]], passive homosexuality was [[Death by burning|punishable by burning]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia: Three Types of Explanation," in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; "Death by sword" was the punishment for a "man coupling like a woman" under the [[Theodosian Code]].&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'' 9.7.3 (4 December 342), introduced by the sons of Constantine in 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Justinian]], all same-sex acts, passive or active, no matter who the partners, were declared contrary to nature and punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia," p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congo ===
[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] recorded that in the past male [[Azande]] warriors in the northern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] routinely took on young male lovers between the ages of twelve and twenty, who helped with household tasks and participated in [[intercrural sex]] with their older husbands. The practice had died out by the early 20th century, after Europeans had gained control of African countries, but was recounted to Evans-Pritchard by the elders to whom he spoke.&lt;ref name=evanspritchard&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans-Pritchard | first1 = E.

=== Feudal Japan ===
In feudal [[Japan]], homosexuality was recognized, between equals (bi-do), in terms of [[pederasty]] (wakashudo), and in terms of prostitution. The younger partner in a pederastic relationship often was expected to make the first move; the opposite was true in ancient Greece. In religious circles, same-sex love spread to the warrior ([[samurai]]) class, where it was customary for a boy in the ''[[wakashū]]'' age category to undergo training in the martial arts by apprenticing to a more experienced adult man. The man was permitted, if the boy agreed, to take the boy as his lover until he came of age; this relationship, often formalized in a "brotherhood contract",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leupp |first=Gary P. |title=Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |pages=53–54 |isbn=0-520-20909-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6q-PqPDAmIC&amp;pg=PA53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was expected to be exclusive, with both partners swearing to take no other (male) lovers. The [[Samurai]] period was one in which homosexuality was seen as particularly positive. Later when Japanese society became pacified, the middle classes adopted many of the practices of the warrior class.

=== Lesotho ===
Anthropologists [[Stephen O. Murray|Stephen Murray]] and [[Will Roscoe]] reported that women in [[Lesotho]] engaged in socially sanctioned "long term, erotic relationships" called ''[[motsoalle]].''&lt;ref name=murrayroscoe&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boy Wives and Female Husbands: Studies of African Homosexualities |last=Murray |first=Stephen (ed.) |authorlink=Stephen O. Murray |author2=[[Will Roscoe|Roscoe, Will]] (ed.) |year=1998 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-312-23829-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In [[Papua New Guinea]], same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture of certain tribes until the middle of the last century. The [[Etoro tribe|Etoro]] and [[Marind-anim]] for example, even viewed heterosexuality as wasteful and celebrated homosexuality instead. They believed that in sharing semen, they are sharing their life force, yet women simply wasted this force any time they didn't get pregnant after sex. In many traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would "inseminate" him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty.&lt;ref name=melanesia&gt;{{citation |title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia |first=Gilbert H. |last=Herdt |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-08096-3 |pages=128–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">The '''legal financing industry''' provides non-recourse [[legal financing]] to litigants. Sometimes this financing is funded from outside of the firm or from individual lawyer's finances, and then funneled through a third-party company. Financing is often for plaintiffs involved in [[personal injury]], [[workers' compensation]], and civil rights. The industry provides litigants with cash in a [[lump sum]] form upfront in exchange for a share of the litigant's future settlement or trial award. While the litigant awaits the resolution of their case, the legal financing industry provides for immediate relief from financial burdens such as mortgage payments, rent, medical bills, educational bills, daily expenses, or even legal fees.

==History==
[[Legal financing]] is a fairly recent phenomenon, beginning on or around 1997. Lending to plaintiffs began as part of a trend in which banks, [[hedge funds]], and private investors put money into other people’s lawsuits.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Binyamin|title=Lawsuit Loans Add New Risk for the Injured|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/business/17lawsuit.html|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=16 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While every case is different, legal financing companies generally only advance 10% to 15% of the likely settlement.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"/&gt; On the other hand, legal financing companies charge high fees for the advances that they provide.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"/&gt;

The American Legal Financing Association (ALFA) was established in [[New York City]] as a nonprofit in July 2004 and it represents about 20 legal funding companies nationwide for personal injury victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ALFA|url=https://americanlegalfin.com/alfa-membership/alfa-member-companies/|website=ALFA|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization's main goals are to establish voluntary standards for the legal financing industry, and to advocate on behalf of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is ALFA?|url=https://americanlegalfin.com/what-is-alfa/|website=ALFA|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State legislation==
As of 2011 the industry was lending plaintiffs over $100 million a year and remained unregulated in most states.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"/&gt; Commentators have noted that the industry is free to ignore laws that protect consumers who borrow from other kinds of lenders. The industry, however, asserts that they are not lenders because plaintiffs are not required to repay the money if they lose their cases.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"/&gt;  The industry refers to the transactions as investments, advances, financing or funding, as opposed to loans.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"/&gt;  This is an argument that has persuaded regulators in many states, including New York, that lawsuit lenders are not subject to existing lending laws.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"/&gt; The companies and lawyers who support the industry have also lobbied state legislatures to establish rules like licensing and disclosure requirements.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"/&gt;

In 2003, the [[Ohio Supreme Court]] struck down a [[legal financing]] agreement. A [[legal financing]] company advanced $7,000 to a woman injured in a car accident. The woman prevailed, and the company was allowed to claim over $30,000 of her future winnings. The court refused to allow this, noting that an "intermeddler is not permitted to gorge upon the fruits of litigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rancman v. Interim Settlement Funding Corp., 789 N.E.2d 217, 221 (2003)|url=http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/0/2003/2003-ohio-2721.pdf|website=Supreme Court of Ohio|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was superseded five years later, when the [[Ohio General Assembly]] passed legislation that made lawsuit funding legal.&lt;ref name="CPI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hallman|first1=Ben|title=States are battleground in drive to regulate lawsuit funding|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2011/02/02/2160/states-are-battleground-drive-regulate-lawsuit-funding|website=The Center for Public Integrity|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=2 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industry has obtained lobbying victories in many other states. In [[Texas]], the industry fought a bill introduced in 2005 that would have subjected litigation financing to the same standards as loans.&lt;ref name="CPI"/&gt; The bill was ultimately defeated. There was similar success in [[Ohio]], where a bill legalizing lawsuit lending passed in 2008 with little or no opposition.&lt;ref name="CPI"/&gt;  In 2009, the industry also defeated efforts by Maryland legislators that would have reined in lawsuit funding.&lt;ref name="CPI"/&gt; Maine and Connecticut allow litigation funding by statute, and similar legislation is pending in Kentucky. Furthermore, courts in Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Mississippi, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, and New Hampshire have allowed litigation funding contracts.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"/&gt;

'''The legality of recording by civilians''' refers to laws regarding the recording of other persons and property by means of [[photography|still photography]], [[videography]], and [[audio recording]] in various locations. In many places, it is common for the recording of public property, persons within the public domain, and of private property visible or audible from the public domain to be legal. However, laws have been passed restricting such activity in order to protect the privacy of others. To make matters even more complicated, the laws governing [[photography|still photography]] may be vastly different from the laws governing any type of [[motion picture photography]].

In the United States, anti-photography laws have been passed following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the increased popularity of [[camera phone]]s. There might be local laws and policies governing the specific landmark or property in which one seeks to photograph. Laws on private property differ. Owners of private property in most places must authorize recording on their own property.

==Exceptions==

===High-profile locations===
Signs posted around many bridges, including the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]], state that filming the structure is prohibited. The legality of such restrictions is problematic; in view of the First Amendment, restrictions on taking pictures of a public structure in public may be unconstitutional, (in view of the fact that prohibiting taking pictures will probably neither prevent nor reduce the potential for such attacks, nor do such prohibitions necessarily mean it will in any way hinder someone from committing an attack in the first place.) The courts have held, however, that in some cases, restrictions on taking pictures on military reservations such as military bases, can be constitutionally valid, so a restriction on taking a picture of a structure that is operated by the military or is on a military reservation might be constitutional, but even then, such restrictions must be reasonable and have some relevant purpose. Forbidding pictures of a weapons system on a military base would have relevance to preventing enemy acquisition of technology and would be such a legitimate purpose, but the mere forbidding of taking pictures of a [[latrine]], a [[post exchange]] (PX) or a [[mess hall]] probably would not.

In August 2004, an [[Annandale, Virginia]], man was arrested and detained when his wife was observed by a police officer filming the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] as he drove across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33718-2004Aug25.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Va. Family Defends Video of Bay Bridge | first1=Jerry | last1=Markon | first2=Eric | last2=Rich | date=2004-08-26 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was held as a [[material witness]] after he was found to have ties to [[Hamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28476-2004Aug24.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Va. Man Tied to Hamas Held as Witness | first1=Eric | last1=Rich | first2=Jerry | last2=Markon | date=2004-08-25 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later released on [[bail]] without being charged.

===Voyeurism===
Many places have passed or considered legislation that prohibits voyeurism with phones and other similar devices, commonly referred to as "[[upskirt]]ing" or "[[Downblouse|downblousing]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtopnews.com/index.php?nid=25&amp;sid=619267 |title=Md. Delegate Wants 'Upskirt' Photos Banned - WTOP.com |publisher=Wtopnews.com |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,175341,00.html | work=Fox News | title='Upskirt' Photo Ban Sought | date=2005-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/cameras--videos/upskirting-to-become-a-crime/2006/07/28/1153816375391.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Upskirting to become a crime | date=2006-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such behaviors have become common since camera phones have become popular, thereby raising such concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=Takashi|date=2015-02-01|title=The action of looking at a mobile phone display as nonverbal behavior/communication: A theoretical perspective|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214005652|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=43|pages=68–75|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On March 7th, 2014, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court hearing ruled that taking photos of someone up their skirt was not specifically prevented by peeping tom laws. The Massachusetts Supreme Court Judges concluded that since the current laws didn't make any distinction for clothed individuals, only for 'partially or completely' undressed ones, it was legal under current Massachusetts law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Quinn|first=Garrett|title=Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court: Upskirt photos not illegal under state law|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/boston/index.ssf/2014/03/massachusetts_upskirt_photo_court_ruling.html|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horn|first=Leslie|title=Upskirts Are Totally Legal, Says Bad and Gross MA Court Ruling|url=https://gizmodo.com/upskirts-are-totally-legal-according-to-bad-and-gross-1537206825|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The very next day, legislation was introduced to ban [[upskirt]]ing in its entirety. It soon received bipartisan support and was approved and enacted on March 8th, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ravitz|first=Jessica|title='Upskirt' ban in Massachusetts signed into law|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/07/justice/massachusetts-upskirt-bill/|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public display===
Laws prohibiting the photography of citizens for public display have prevented the creation of recordings for [[Google Street View]] in some countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-8116 |title=Google's Street View could be unlawful in Europe |publisher=Out-law.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice recording===
Laws differ in the United States on how many parties must give their consent before a conversation may be recorded.  In 38 states and the District of Columbia, conversations may be recorded if the person is party to the conversation, or if at least one of the people who are party to the conversation have given a third party consent to record the conversation.  As of 2010, in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington State, the consent of all parties of the conversation must be obtained in order to record a conversation.&lt;ref name="Voice Consent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aapsonline.org/judicial/telephone.htm|title=Summary of Consent Requirements for Taping Telephone Conversations|publisher=Association of American Physicians and Surgeons|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, telephone calls may be recorded without a court order if one of the parties to the call consents to the recording. It is to a judge's discretion as to whether or not to admit the recording into evidence if both parties are not aware of the conversation having been recorded.

There are 6 surviving transcripts of '''letters of Gediminas''' written in 1323–1324 by Grand Duke [[Gediminas]]. These letters are one of the first surviving documents from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Since they were sent to the Western Europe, the pope, merchants, and craftspeople, they were written in [[Latin]].

The first letter was written to [[Pope John XXII]]. Gediminas claimed that the [[Teutonic Knights]] did not act in the interest of the Catholic faith. Instead, they brutally devastated the land. The people were forced into resistance. Gediminas enumerated many crimes and damages done by the knights; for example, he claimed that his predecessor [[Vytenis]] sent a letter to the [[Franciscan]] monks asking for two brothers who could come to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to look after a local church. When the Teutonic Knights learned about the letter, they sent their army and destroyed the church. In the last sentence Gediminas vaguely promised to accept Christianity and obey the pope.

The second letter was written on January 25, 1323 to the German cities of [[Lübeck]], [[Sund, Sweden|Sund]], [[Bremen]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Cologne]] and other cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Gediminas explained that the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was very tolerant to the Christians, but remained pagan and did not accept Christianity only because of brutal Teutonic Knights. He told about the first letter sent to the pope and his intentions to baptize in the Catholic rite. Gediminas invited knights, [[squire]]s, merchants, doctors, smiths, wheelwrights, [[shoemaking|cobbler]]s, [[Skinner (profession)|skinners]], millers, and others to come to the Grand Duchy and practice their trade and faith without any restrictions. The peasants were promised tax exemption for ten years. The merchants were also exempt from any tariffs or taxes. This letter is best known because [[Vilnius]], capital of Lithuania, was mentioned in written sources for the first time. Therefore, 1323 is considered to be the official founding year of Vilnius. Gediminas is considered to be the city's founder even though the city existed years before Gediminas' reign. Also, Vilnius is unambiguously mentioned as the capital city. His invitation notably included German Jews as well as Christians, and its issuance is closely linked to the establishment of the [[Litvaks|Jewish community in Lithuania]].

The third letter addressed to Lübeck, [[Rostock]], Sund, [[Greifswald]], [[Stetin]], [[Gotland]] cities was written on May 26, 1323. In essence it repeated the second letter. It asked for various craftspeople (the list of crafts was expanded) to come to Lithuania and practice their trade. It said that there were three churches in the duchy: two Franciscan (in Vilnius and in [[Navahradak]]) and one [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. Everyone was free to use them.

The fourth and the fifth letters were also written on May 26, 1323 and were addressed to the Franciscan and Dominican Orders. Gediminas, in anticipation of his baptism, invited priests and monks to come to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He also asked to spread the word to craftspeople that they were welcome in Lithuania. In the letter to the Dominicans, Gediminas mentioned that his seal was burned by the Teutonic Knights.

The last surviving letter was written on September 22, 1324 and was addressed to the bishop of [[Tartu]], Erzel, ruler of [[Tallinn]] land, and Council of [[Riga]]. It reported that the Teutonic Knights violated a peace treaty signed earlier. The Knights attacked border regions, killed residents, and took all valuables. Many messengers were captured and killed. Gediminas asked for help enforcing the treaty.

==Before 1990==
*22 September 1920: In reprisal for [[Rineen Ambush|an ambush]] by the IRA, Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) officers killed 5 civilians and burnt 16 houses/shops in west [[County Clare]], Ireland.
*21 November 1920: The [[Bloody Sunday (1920)#Afternoon|Croke Park massacre]] in Dublin, Ireland. [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) officers opened-fire on civilians who were watching a [[Gaelic football]] match in [[Croke Park]]; 14 were killed and 60–70 wounded. The attack was believed to be revenge for an IRA assassination operation earlier in the day.
*24 March 1922: The [[McMahon murders]] in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Officers of the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) broke into a house owned by an Irish Catholic family and shot all eight males inside. Six were killed. It is believed to have been a reprisal for the IRA's killing of two policemen the day before.
*1 April 1922: The [[Arnon Street killings]] in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland. Ten officers of the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] (USC) broke into a number of [[Irish Catholic]]-owned homes and killed six Catholic civilians (including a child). This was believed to have been a reprisal for the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]'s killing of a policeman in the area.
*25 December 1951: Five [[Hispanic]] men and two white men were severely beaten by members of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], in an incident known as the [[Bloody Christmas (1951)|Bloody Christmas]]. Eight officers were indicted for assault, and five were found guilty. 
*21 March 1960. South African police shot at a crowd of black anti-apartheid protesters, killing 69 and injuring over 180 in what became known as the [[Sharpeville massacre]]. Evidence showed that the police continued firing even when the crowd had turned to run, and the majority of those killed and wounded were shot in the back. The [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] later concluded that the police actions had constituted "gross human rights violations in that excessive force was unnecessarily used to stop a gathering of unarmed people."  (see [[Sharpeville massacre]] article for sourcing).
*17 October 1961. The [[National Police (France)|French police]] attacked a large demonstration of unarmed and peaceful protesters of [[Algeria]]n origin, killing between 70 and 200 (numbers are uncertain, partly because many were drowned after being thrown into the [[Seine]] with their hands tied), in the [[Paris massacre of 1961]].
*19 April 1969 in [[Derry]], Northern Ireland. During rioting between Irish nationalists and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC), RUC officers broke into the home of Catholic civilian Samuel Devenny (42), who was not involved in the riots. The officers kicked Devenny and beat him ferociously with batons. His young daughter (who was recovering from surgery) and a family friend were beaten unconscious. His older daughter and son were also attacked. It is believed that the attack led to Devenny's death on 17 July 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policeombudsman.org/publicationsuploads/Devenny-report.pdf Findings on Devenny investigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829082334/http://www.policeombudsman.org/publicationsuploads/Devenny-report.pdf |date=29 August 2011 }}, [[Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*13 July 1969 in [[Dungiven]], Northern Ireland. Catholic civilian Francis McCloskey (67) was beaten with batons by [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) officers during street disturbances and died of his injuries the following day. He is sometimes deemed to be the first death of "[[The Troubles]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch69.htm#Jul Chronology of the Conflict: July 1969], [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*14–15 August 1969: During the [[1969 Northern Ireland riots]], the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) shot dead five Catholic civilians and opened-fire on crowds of Irish nationalist protesters.
*1967–74: the methods of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Greek military junta]] were documented in the docudrama ''[[Your Neighbor's Son]]''. It focused on the brutalization of young Military Police recruits which turned them into torturers. Michalis Petrou, a conscript who became a notorious torturer, testified against his former colleagues.&lt;ref name=NYT-review&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Lawrence Van Gelder]]|title= Din nabos soen (1981)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/157325/Din-nabos-soen/overview|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 August 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current methods ==
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! '''Method''' !! Description
|-
| align="center" | [[Hanging]]||One of the most common methods of execution, still in use in many countries, usually with a calculated drop to cause neck fracture and instant loss of consciousness. Notably used by [[Capital punishment in India|India]], [[Capital punishment in Japan|Japan]], and [[Capital punishment in Singapore|Singapore]].
|-
| align="center" | [[Execution_by_shooting|Shooting]]|| Also a very common method. Can be applied:

* By a [[execution by shooting|single shot]] (such as the neck shot, as in [[Capital punishment in China|China]], and by various means in [[Capital_punishment_in_Russia#Procedure|Russia]] before Russia abolished capital punishment);
* By [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] (as in [[Capital punishment in Indonesia|Indonesia]]). 
* By excessively powerful weaponry such as anti-aircraft guns, according to various media sources (CNN, Fox News, The Independent, etc.), practiced in North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/22/north-korea-dictator-kim-jong-uns-executions-anti-aircraft-guns-flamethrowers-mortars.html|title=North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un's executions: anti-aircraft guns, flamethrowers, mortars|author=|date=22 September 2017|website=foxnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-defector-anti-aircraft-guns-execution-kim-jong-un-killed-sex-slaves-pyongyang-porn-film-a7959851.html|title=North Korean defector reveals horror of Kim Jong-un's teenage sex slaves|author=|date=21 September 2017|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/28/asia/north-korea-officials-executed/index.html|title=N. Korea executed 5 security officials, S. Korea says|first=Euan|last=McKirdy|date=February 28, 2017|website=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| align="center" | [[Lethal injection]]|| First used in the [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] in 1982, lethal injection has been used by five other countries since then, which are China, Taiwan, Thailand, Guatemala, and Vietnam.
|-
| align="center" | [[Electric chair|Electrocution]]|| Only the United States and the [[Capital punishment in the Philippines|Philippines]] have ever used this method. Now legal in some U.S. states only to replace injection at the request of the prisoner or if injection is impractical.
|-
| align="center" | [[Gas chamber|Gas inhalation]]||Only the United States and [[Capital punishment in Lithuania|Lithuania]] have ever used this as a capital punishment method. Now legal in some U.S. states only to replace injection at the request of the prisoner or if injection is impractical. Also used in Nazi Germany during World War 2 as a weapon for [[The Holocaust|mass murder]]. It has been recently proposed to use [[nitrogen hypoxia]] to replace injection.
|-
| align="center" | [[Beheading]]|| Has been used at various points in history in many countries. One of the most famous forms is execution by [[guillotine]]. Now used only in [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] with a sword.
|-
| align="center" | [[Stoning]]|| The condemned is pummeled by stones thrown by a group of people with the totality of the injuries suffered leading to eventual death.
|-
| align="center" | [[Crucifixion]]|| Roping or nailing to a wooden cross or similar apparatus (such as a tree) and allowing to perish.{{Where|date= November 2018|talk=yes}}

* Devouring by animals, as in ''[[damnatio ad bestias]]'' (i.e., as in the [[cliché]], "being thrown to the lions"), as well as by [[alligator]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[piranha]] and [[shark]]s.
* Stings from scorpions and bites by snakes, spiders, etc. (e.g. the "[[Snake pit]]" of Germanic legend){{Dubious|date=September 2012}}&lt;!--We should have at least one non-legendary account in which a person is *sentenced to death* by venomous bite. Otherwise this entry ought to be removed, and sooner than in two years from now.--&gt;
* Tearing apart by horses (''e.g.'', in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe and [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial China]], with four horses; or "[[Hanged, drawn and quartered|quartering]]", with four horses, as in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' and ''[[Child Owlet]]'').
* Trampling by horses (example: [[Al-Musta'sim]], the last [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] in [[Baghdad]]).

J.|last=Saunders|date=1 March 2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|via=Google Books|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; (example: the Mongolian leader [[Jamukha]] was probably executed this way in 1206).&lt;ref&gt;''The Secret History of the Mongols'', book 8, chapter 201.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| align="center" | [[Blowing from a gun]]||Tied to the mouth of a cannon, which is then fired.
|-
| align="center" | [[Blood Eagle]]||Cutting the skin of the victim by the spine, breaking the ribs so they resembled blood-stained wings, and pulling the lungs out through the wounds in the victim's back. Used by the [[Vikings]].
|-
| align="center" | [[Boiling to death]]||This penalty was carried out using a large cauldron filled with water, oil, tar, tallow, or even molten lead.
|-
| align="center" | [[Brazen bull]]||Pushed inside an iron bull statue and then cooked alive after a fire is lit under it.
|-
| align="center" | [[Breaking wheel]]||Also known as the Catherine wheel, after a [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria|saint]] who was allegedly sentenced to be executed by this method.

|-
| align="center" | [[Execution by burning|Burning]]||Most infamous as a method of execution for [[Heresy|heretics]] and [[Witchcraft|witches]]. A slower method of applying single pieces of burning wood was used by [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Native Americans]] in torturing their captives to death.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Drimmer (ed.) ''"Captured by the Indians - 15 Firsthand Accounts, 1750-1870"'', Dover Publications, Mineola, N.Y., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| align="center" | [[Crushing (execution)|Crushing]]|| By a weight, abruptly or as a slow ordeal.
|-
| align="center" | [[Disembowelment]]||Often employed as a preliminary stage to the actual execution, e.g. by beheading; an integral part of ''[[seppuku]]'' (''harakiri''), which was sometimes used as a form of capital punishment.
|-
| align="center" | [[Dismemberment]]|| Being [[drawn and quartered]] sometimes resulted in dismemberment.  Note: has been used in combination, such as [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]
|-
| align="center" | [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|Drawing and quartering]]||English method of executing those found guilty of [[high treason]].
|-
| align="center" | [[Falling (execution)|Falling]]||The victim is thrown off a height or into a hollow (example: the ''Barathron'' in Athens, into which the Athenian generals condemned for their part in the [[battle of Arginusae]] were cast).&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''"Hellenica"'', book I, chapter VII.&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina during the [[Dirty War]], those [[forced disappearance|secretly abducted]] were later drugged and [[Death flights|thrown from an airplane into the ocean]].
|-
| align="center" | [[Flaying]]||The skin is removed from the body.
|-
| align="center" | [[Garrote]]||Used most commonly in [[Spain]] and in former Spanish colonies (e.g. the [[Philippines]]), used to strangle or choke someone.
|-
| align="center" | [[Gibbeting]]||The act of gibbeting refers to the use of a gallows-type structure from which the victim was usually placed within a cage which is then hung in a public location and the victim left to die to deter other existing or potential criminals.
|-
| align="center" | [[Immurement]]||The confinement of a person by walling off any exits; since they were usually kept alive through an opening, this was more a form of [[imprisonment for life]] than of capital punishment (example: the countess [[Elisabeth Báthory]], who lived for four more years after having been immured).
|-
| align="center" | [[Impalement]]||The penetration of a human by an object such as a stake, pole, spear, or hook, often by complete or partial perforation of the torso.
|-
|align="center" | [[Keelhauling]]||European maritime punishment.
|-
| align="center" | [[Poena cullei]]||Documented used during the Roman empire. The condemned is stuffed into a sack together with a number of animals and thrown into a body of water.
|-
| align="center" | [[Poisoning]] || Before modern times, sayak (사약, 賜藥) was the method of capital punishment of nobles (''[[yangban]]'') and members of the royal family during the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in [[Korea]] due to the [[Confucianist]] belief that one may kill a [[seonbi]] but may not insult him (사가살불가욕, 士可殺不可辱). Poisoning by drinking an infusion of [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]] was used as a method of execution in ancient Greece.
|-
| align="center" | [[Pendulum (torture device)|Pendulum]]&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Melville (1905), "The Use and Forms of Judicial Torture in England and Scotland," ''The Scottish Historical Review'', vol. 2, p. 228; Geoffrey Abbott (2006) ''Execution: the guillotine, the Pendulum, the Thousand Cuts, the Spanish Donkey, and 66 Other Ways of Putting Someone to Death'', MacMillan, {{ISBN|0-312-35222-0}}, p. 213.  Both of these refer to the use of the pendulum (''pendola'')by inquisitorial tribunals.  Melville, however, refers only to its use as a torture method, while Abbott suggests that the device was purposely allowed to kill the victim if he refused to confess.&lt;/ref&gt; || A type of machine with an axe head for a weight that slices closer to the victim's torso over time. (''Of disputed historicity.'')
|-
| align="center" | [[Sawing (torture)|Sawing]]||(''Of disputed historicity.'')
|-
| align="center" | [[Scaphism]]|| An Ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] method of execution in which the condemned was placed in between two boats, force fed a mixture of honey and milk, and left floating in a stagnant pond. The victim would then suffer from severe diarrhea, which would attract insects that would burrow, nest, and feed on the victim. The victim would eventually die from [[septic shock]].  
|-
| align="center" | [[Slow slicing]]||Methodically removing portions of the body over an extended period of time, typically with a knife, eventually resulting in death.
|-
| align="center" | [[Asphyxia#Smothering|Smothering (Asphyxia)]]|| [[Suffocation in ash]]

The '''Metropolitan Police Act 1856''' (19 Vict c 2) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, passed on 28 February 1856. The Act modified the previous two Metropolitan Police Acts of [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829|1829]] and [[Metropolitan Police Act 1839|1839]], merging the two roles of First Commissioner and Second Commissioner into the single role of [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis]] and setting up a system of two [[Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Assistant Commissioners]] under him. The roles of First and Second Joint Commissioner had been filled by [[Richard Mayne]] and [[William Hay (police commissioner)|William Hay]] until the latter's death in 1855. The Act provided for one of the First and Second Commissioners to become the sole Commissioner as soon as the other one died - effectively it meant that no new Second Joint Commissioner was appointed and Mayne became sole Commissioner. The Act also set the maximum for the Commissioner's annual salary at £1500 and that for each Assistant Commissioner at £800.

The Act also established the Assistant Commissioners as [[ex officio]] [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]] for all counties then partly or wholly covered by the [[Metropolitan Police District]] (i.e. [[Middlesex]], [[Surrey]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Essex]], [[Kent]], [[Berkshire]] and [[Buckinghamshire]]). He was not to act as a JP, however, "at any Court of General or Quarter Sessions, or in any Matter out of Sessions, except for the Preservation of the Peace, the Prevention of Crimes, the Detention and Committal of Offenders, and in carrying into execution the Purposes of this Act and the said recited Acts" and like usual JPs could not be elected as a Member of Parliament or vote in some General Elections. In the case of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis being ill or the post being left vacant, either Assistant Commissioner could be authorised by one of the Principal Secretaries of State to act as acting Commissioner. The Assistant Commissioners were also to be "within the Provisions of the Act of the Session holden in the Fourth and Fifth Years of King William the Fourth, Chapter Twenty-four, in like Manner as if their Offices were enumerated in the Schedule to that Act".

'''The Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Initiative (NSI)''' is a program of the United States Government used to collect and share reports of suspicious activity by people in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nationwide [[Suspicious Activity Report (justice and homeland security)|SAR]] Initiative (NSI) builds on what law enforcement and other agencies have been doing for years — gathering information regarding behaviors and incidents associated with criminal activity — but without the customary restrictions on collecting data on individuals in the absence of [[reasonable suspicion]] or [[probable cause]]. The program has established a standardized process whereby SARs can be shared among agencies to help detect and prevent terrorism-related criminal activity. This process is in direct response to the mandate to establish a "unified process for reporting, tracking, and accessing [SARs]" in a manner that rigorously protects the privacy and civil liberties of Americans, as called for in the ''2007 National Strategy for Information Sharing'' (NSIS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Reports of suspicious behavior noticed by local law enforcement or by private citizens are forwarded to state and major urban area fusion centers as well as DHS and the FBI for analysis.  Sometimes this information is combined with other information to evaluate the suspicious activity in greater context.

==Background==
Suspicious activity is defined in the ''ISE-SAR Functional Standard (ISE-SAR FS) Version 1.5'' &lt;ref name="ISE-SAR FS 1.5"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "observed [[behavior]] reasonably indicative of pre-operational planning related to [[terrorism]] or other criminal activity."  It is important to note that the NSI is a behavior-focused approach to identifying suspicious activity. Factors such as race, ethnicity, national origin, or religious affiliation are NOT considered as factors that create suspicion (except if used as part of a specific suspect description). The behaviors outlined in the ISE-SAR FS were identified by subject-matter experts; validated through implementation in the Los Angeles, California, Police Department and the application of ten years of State and Local Anti-Terrorism Training (SLATT) Program
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| title =State and Local Anti-Terrorism Training Program webpage
| publisher = ''US Department of Justice''
| url = https://www.slatt.org/default.aspx
| accessdate =December 22, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; experience; and then adjusted based on input by privacy advocacy representatives. At the completion of this process, in May 2009, the ISE-SAR FS was published, with the entire SAR process anchored on behaviors of suspicious activity, not ethnicity, race, or gender.

The NSI is currently being implemented through a partnership between the national network of [[fusion center]]s and key federal agencies that will coordinate with law enforcement officers in their states. This partnership spans the spectrum of customized technology solutions and includes training and the development of comprehensive [[privacy]], [[civil rights]] and civil liberties policies at both the federal and fusion center levels. This approach also provides for a decentralized process that respects the state's unique requirements but maintains national standards that permit the interoperability of [[information exchange]]s and the consistent application of a privacy framework, and is consistent with the allocation of responsibilities to the 72 designated State and major urban area fusion centers.

On December 17, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice was named the Executive Agent to establish and operate the Program Management Office (PMO) for the NSI, taking on responsibility for coordinating existing resources and managing additional support to further develop and deploy the NSI.  In March 2010, the PMO was established within the Bureau of Justice Assistance.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| title ='US Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance webpage
| publisher = ''US Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance''
| url = http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/BJA/
| accessdate =December 22, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This interagency office, led by senior staff from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), also coordinates closely with other federal, state, local, and tribal partners.

The goal of the PMO is to facilitate the implementation of the NSI across all levels of government, and assist participating agencies to adopt compatible processes, policies, and standards that foster broader sharing of SARs, while ensuring that privacy and civil liberties are protected in accordance with local, state, and federal laws and regulations.  Primary functions of the Program Management Office include advocating on behalf of the NSI, providing guidance to participants at all levels, and coordinating various efforts within the NSI. Given the criticality of privacy and civil liberties issues, the PMO works collaboratively with, and is supported by, the DOJ Privacy and Civil Liberties Office.

==NSI Training==
To ensure that the behavior-focused approach that is outlined in the ISE-SAR Functional Standard is institutionalized, the NSI created a multifaceted training approach designed to increase the effectiveness of federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement professionals in identifying, reporting, evaluating, and sharing pre-incident terrorism indicators to prevent acts of terrorism.
&lt;ref name=NSI_Overview/&gt;
There are currently three briefings/trainings available through the NSI PMO, with several others under development:
* '''Executive Briefing'''
Law enforcement executives play a vital role in ensuring that the SAR process is not only successfully implemented but effectively supported. The SAR Executive Briefings focus on executive leadership, policy development, privacy and civil liberties protections, agency training, and community outreach. Fusion centers, law enforcement professional associations, and additional entities conduct these types of briefings in a variety of venues.
* '''Analytic Training'''
Ensuring that SARs are properly reviewed and vetted is critical to promoting the integrity of information submitted; protecting citizens' privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties; and successfully implementing the SAR process. The SAR Analytic Role Training focuses on the evaluation of SARs to identify behaviors that may be associated with pre-incident terrorism planning and the process for sharing terrorism-related SARs nationwide. Through this curriculum, analysts and investigators are trained to recognize terrorism-related pre-incident indicators and to validate—based on a combination of knowledge, experience, and available information—whether the behavior has a potential nexus to terrorism and meets criteria for submission. The training is delivered in an eight-hour workshop format.
* '''Line-Officer Training'''
Frontline law enforcement personnel are trained to recognize behavior and incidents that may indicate criminal activity associated with terrorism. Their routine duties position them to observe and report suspicious behaviors or activities. The SAR Line Officer Training focuses on the critical role line officers have in the effective implementation of the SAR process by identifying and documenting suspicious activity. To efficiently deliver training to a large number of line officers in a timely manner, this training is delivered through a 15-minute CD that has been posted to several online/distance-learning formats.

==Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Protections==
NSI program administrators claim they are aware of the importance of protecting the personal privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of all Americans, and in response have developed and implemented a comprehensive NSI Privacy Protection Framework that is required for agencies at all levels of government prior to participation in the NSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participating agencies must have an approved privacy policy that specifically addresses the SAR process; applies the protections outlined in the ISE-SAR Functional Standard (Version 1.5) &lt;ref name="ISE-SAR FS 1.5"/&gt; and the ISE Privacy Guidelines; and participate in each of the three training programs described above.  The NSI PMO also requires that participating fusion centers have policies that address how the center incorporates applicable state laws, agency rules, and regulations into the sharing of terrorism-related SAR information.

===NSI Privacy Protection Framework===
The NSI requires each site to consider privacy throughout the SAR process by fully adopting the following NSI Privacy Protection Framework prior to NSI participation:
* '''Privacy policy:''' The adoption and implementation of an approved privacy policy that contains ISE-SAR privacy protections that are in compliance with required provisions contained in the ISE-SAR Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Protection Policy Template or the Fusion Center Privacy Policy Development: Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Policy Template. It is important to note that an NSI program requirement exists that requires sites to have a policy developed and adopted prior to the interstate sharing of ISE-SARs.
* '''ISE-SAR Functional Standard:''' The application of the most current version of the ISE-SAR FS, which reinforces constitutional standards, including the protection of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment and limitations on the use of certain factors—including race, ethnicity, national origin, or religious affiliation—in the gathering, collecting, storing, and sharing of information about individuals.&lt;ref name="ISE-SAR FS 1.5"/&gt; The standard also includes reliability indicators, included as a result of input from privacy advocates. The functional standard, through the use of Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD), allows the originating agency to include or not include fields that contain personal information based upon the agency's rules and policies.
* '''Privacy training:''' The delivery of privacy training, through which the ISE-SAR FS is effectively communicated to personnel with responsibilities in the ISE-SAR arena, ensures the proper application of this standard. Furthermore, to expedite privacy policy development and implementation, it is strongly recommended that NSI sites have access to the services of a trained privacy officer who is available to provide ongoing advice and assistance regarding the protection of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. Three levels of training have been developed for the NSI, all of which include privacy materials. The NSI training levels are chief executive, analyst investigator, and line officer.

===SAR Vetting Process===
A key aspect of the NSI is the SAR vetting process. Before an agency can move SARs from the agency systems to the ISE, two forms of vetting must occur. Supervisors who initially receive a SAR from law enforcement officers, public safety agencies, private sector partners, or citizens must initially review the SAR to determine whether it has a nexus to terrorism and whether it includes the behaviors identified in the ISE-SAR FS.&lt;ref name="ISE-SAR FS 1.5"/&gt; Trained analysts must then analyze the SAR against the behaviors identified in the ISE-SAR FS. Throughout the vetting process, privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties are vigilantly and actively protected through the training that analysts receive and through the system attributes that are a part of the NSI.

===Community Outreach===
The success of the NSI largely depends on the ability of law enforcement agencies to earn and maintain the public's trust, which is accomplished through a transparent process that addresses the concerns of citizens and by engaging collaboratively with advocacy groups.  To support a fusion center's efforts to interact with its community, as well as local law enforcement, the NSI Program Management Office (PMO) led the development and participation in the ''Building Communities of Trust (BCOT) initiative''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| title =Building Communities of Trust overview
| publisher = ''US Department of Justice''
| url = http://nsi.ncirc.gov/documents/e071021293_BuildingCommTrust_v2-August%2016.pdf
| accessdate =December 22, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This initiative is designed to assist fusion centers in engaging community leaders in a dialogue about the center's functions, including the SAR process, the NSI, and the need for interaction with community leaders.  Outreach to advocacy groups has served an essential role in shaping the NSI Privacy Protection Framework and will continue to play an important role in the NSI as it moves forward.

===System Attributes===
In addition to multiple levels of SAR review by trained personnel, there are system attributes that support privacy protections for the gathering, collection, storage, and sharing of SAR information, such as:
* Improved data standards for information sharing using the [[National Information Exchange Model]] (www.niem.gov).
* Leveraging existing secure systems, networks, and resources, such as the [[Regional Information Sharing Systems]], [[Law Enforcement Online]], the [[Homeland Security]] Information Network, the [[National Criminal Intelligence Resource Center]] (www.ncirc.gov), and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[eGuardian]] system.
* Built-in design [[privacy protection]]s, such as user [[authentication]], "investigative purposes only" disclosures upon log-in, articulated investigative reason for accessing the system, clearly stated "for official law enforcement use only" warning before system access, and [[audit log]]s for capturing search transactions.
* Formatting in accordance with the ISE-SAR FS's [[IEPD]] format, which includes the application of privacy fields.

===Compliance Verification===
The U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Criticism==
According to an investigation by the Washington Post, this program, "by far the largest and most technologically sophisticated in the nation's history, collects, stores and analyzes information about thousands of U.S. citizens and residents, many of whom have not been accused of any wrongdoing." Reports of suspicious behavior noticed by local law enforcement, or even by private citizens, are forwarded to the program, and profiles are constructed of persons who are merely under suspicion, without [[Adjudication|adjudicated]] [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] or [[reasonable suspicion]] that a crime is being committed.&lt;ref name=Priest_Arkin/&gt; It has been described as "a vast domestic [[spying]] network to collect information on Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iBYGvu3sDVMZtQNc2OpYtcWhN56A?docId=CNG.83881cb4742d6ee8cf68ac1c3900d725.1a1| title=Government builds vast domestic spying network: report| publisher=AFP| date=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the program's fusion centers "raise very serious [[privacy]] issues at a time when new technology, government powers and zeal in the "[[war on terrorism]]" are combining to threaten Americans' privacy at an unprecedented level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/whats-wrong-fusion-centers-executive-summary| title=What's Wrong With Fusion Centers - Executive Summary| publisher=American Civil Liberties Union| date=December 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 and 2006, fifty-three individuals involved with peace groups, the anti-death penalty movement, and other causes were improperly added to a terrorist and drug trafficking data base by the Maryland State Police. Former Maryland Attorney General Stephen Sachs said the 14 months of covert police surveillance, which took place in 2005 and 2006, was "not predicated on any information indicating that those individuals or groups had committed or planned any criminal misconduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.explorehoward.com/news/60694/terrorist-pretty-horrible-word/| author=Jennifer Broadwater| title='Terrorist is a pretty horrible word'| publisher=Howard County Times| date=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''New York University Law Review''''' is a flagship generalist [[law review]] journal publishing legal scholarship in all areas, including legal theory and policy, environmental law, legal history, international law, and more. Each year, its six issues publish legal scholarship written by professors, judges, and legal practitioners, as well as Notes written by current students at [[New York University School of Law]], who are members of the ''Law Review''.

== Overview ==

The ''New York University Law Review'' was founded in 1924 as a collaborative effort between law students and members of the local bar.&lt;ref&gt;1 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first editor-in-chief was Paul D. Kaufman. Between 1924 and 1950, it was variously known as the ''Annual Review of the Law School of New York University'',&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''id.''&lt;/ref&gt; the ''New York University Law Quarterly Review'',&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', 10 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''New York University Law Review''.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', 2 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1950, it has been known exclusively as the ''New York University Law Review''.

The ''Law Review'' publishes six issues per year in April, May, June, October, November, and December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyulawreview.org/about N.Y.U. Law Review - About&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Circulation is about 1,500.&lt;ref&gt;81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. v-vi (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The journal publishes a wide range of scholarship by professors and judges, with a particular emphasis on legal theory,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Randall T. Shepard, ''The New Role of State Supreme Courts as Engines of Court Reform'', 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1535 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; administrative law,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Matthew D. Adler, ''Welfare Polls: A Synthesis'', 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1875 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; environmental law,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', James Salzman, ''Creating Markets for Ecosystem Services: Notes from the Field'', 80 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 870 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; legal history,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Joel A. Nichols, ''Religious Liberty in the Thirteenth Colony: Church-State Relations in Colonial and Early National Georgia'', 80 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1693 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; and international law.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Robert B. Ahdieh, ''Between Dialogue and Decree: International Review of National Courts'', 79 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 2029 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ''Law Review'' is known for its commitment to student scholarship. In 2006, it published twenty-six articles written by law students.

The ''Law Review'' ranks fourth in Washington &amp; Lee Law School's overall law review rankings, following the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', and ''[[Columbia Law Review]]''. With Yale, it ranks first in "impact factor," a measure of the average number of times each published article is cited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/ Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selection ==

Each year, the ''Law Review'' selects 52 new members from a class of approximately 450. Members are selected using a competitive process, which takes into account an applicant's first-year grades, performance in a writing competition, and potential to contribute to diversity on the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYU Law Review, Membership Selection|url=http://www.nyulawreview.org/about/member-selection}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Law Review'', as is the case at virtually all law schools, is the most selective journal at New York University School of Law.

==Lawsuit over discrimination against white males==
On October 6, 2018, a group that calls itself Faculty, Alumni, and Students Opposed to Racial Preferences (FASORP), filed a lawsuit against the law review over discrimination against white males both in selecting the staff editors and selecting articles to publish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=|website=harvardlawreview.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-14}}{cite news|last=Binkley|first=Collin|title=Harvard, NYU law reviews sued over alleged discrimination|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/harvard-nyu-law-reviews-sued-over-alleged-discrimination/2018/10/09/af2b1510-cc08-11e8-ad0a-0e01efba3cc1_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.6e6306874c23/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[corporate law]] in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, an '''oppression remedy''' is a statutory right available to [[oppressed shareholder]]s. It empowers the shareholders to bring an action against the corporation in which they own shares when the conduct of the company has an effect that is oppressive, unfairly prejudicial, or unfairly disregards the interests of a shareholder. It was introduced in response to ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'', which had held that where a company's actions were ratified by a majority of the shareholders, the courts will not generally interfere.

It has been widely copied in companies legislation throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], including:

==Introduction in the United Kingdom==
{{see also|Unfair prejudice in United Kingdom company law}}
An oppression remedy, intended to operate as an alternative to [[winding up]] a company, was adopted as s. 210 of the ''[[Companies Act 1948]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Now {{cite web|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/part/30|title = Part 30}} of the ''[[Companies Act 2006]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which declared:

{{quotation|
'''210'''. (1) Any member of a company who complains that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner oppressive to some part of the members (including himself) or, in a case falling within [s. 169(3)], the [[Board of Trade]], may make an application to the court by petition for an order under this section.

:(2) If on any such petition the court is of opinion{{emdash}}
::(a) that the company's affairs are being conducted as aforesaid; and
::(b) that to wind up the company would unfairly prejudice that part of the members, but otherwise the facts would justify the making of a winding-up order on the ground that it was just and equitable that the company should be wound up;
:the court may, with a view to bringing to an end the matters complained of, make such order as it thinks fit, whether for regulating the conduct of the company's affairs in future, or for the purchase of the shares of any members of the company by other members of the company or by the company and, in the case of a purchase by the company, for the reduction accordingly of the company's capital, or otherwise.
}}

In the ''[[Companies Act 2006]]'', the relevant provision is expressed in s. 994 (and the Secretary of State has similar authority under s. 995):

{{quotation|
'''994'''. (1) A member of a company may apply to the court by petition for an order under this Part on the ground{{emdash}}

:(a) that the company's affairs are being or have been conducted in a manner that is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of members generally or of some part of its members (including at least himself), or
:(b) that an actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial.
}}

Conduct that is considered to constitute "unfair prejudice" has been given a broad interpretation, which can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Anthony Lee|title = Guide to Unfair Prejudice Against Shareholders|url = http://www.ashfords.co.uk/news/shareholders_disputes_guide|publisher = Ashfords|accessdate = {{date|2013-7-3}}|date = {{date|2012-11-1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* exclusion from management in circumstances where there is a legitimate expectation of participation;
:* the diversion of business to another company in which the majority shareholder holds an interest;
:* the awarding by the majority shareholder to himself of excessive financial benefits; and
:* abuses of power and breaches of the Articles of Association.

The conduct is not confined to a specific group. In ''Re HR Harmer Ltd'', [[Jenkins LJ]] noted that the definition is "wide enough to cover oppression by anyone who is taking part in the conduct of the affairs of the company whether ''[[de facto]]'' or ''[[de jure]]''."&lt;ref&gt;[1959] 1 WLR 62 at 75&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it can cover the actions of:

:* directors,
:* a controlling shareholder,
:* persons with ''de facto'' control of the company,
:* a class of shareholders, or
:* conduct of a related company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Roman Tomasic|author2= Stephen Bottomley|author3 = Rob McQueen|edition = 2nd|title= Corporations Law in Australia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zFSgs52KSmoC&amp;lpg=PA410&amp;ots=x0ymO3P5oX&amp;pg=PA414#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate= |year= 2002|publisher= [[Federation Press]]|location= Annandale, NSW|isbn= 1-86287-314-3|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in Canada==
{{see also|Oppression remedy in Canadian corporate law}}
Provisions similar to s. 210 of the 1948 UK Act were first introduced into Canadian law through the 1975 passage of the ''[[Canada Business Corporations Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Canada Business Corporations Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1974-76|chapter = 33|section=234|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl197476v01cana#page/886/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporated recommendations made in 1962 by the UK [[Jenkins Committee on Company Law]] for removing the linkage of the remedy with that of [[winding-up]] and for broadening its scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Dickerson|first1= Robert W.V.|last2= Howard|first2= John L.|last3= Getz|first3= Leon|date= 1971|title= Proposals for a New Business Corporations Law for Canada|url= http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/ic/RG35-1-1971-I-eng.pdf|location= Ottawa|publisher= Information Canada|volume= I|at= par. 485-486, at pp. 162-164}}; 1971 draft s. 19.04 shown at {{cite book |last1= Dickerson|first1= Robert W.V.|last2= Howard|first2= John L.|last3= Getz|first3= Leon|date= 1971|title= Proposals for a New Business Corporations Law for Canada|url= http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/ic/RG35-1-1971-II-eng.pdf|location= Ottawa|publisher= Information Canada|volume= II|pages=175-177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian legislation (both federally and in all provinces other than [[Prince Edward Island]]) provides for a broad approach to the oppression remedy ({{lang-fr|recours en oppression}}). In ''[[Peoples Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] noted:

{{quotation|

A "complainant" is deemed to be a current or former registered security holder, a current or former director or officer, the Director appointed under the ''CBCA'', or "any other person who, in the discretion of a court, is a proper person to make an application under this Part."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =Canada Business Corporations Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =C-44|section =238|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-44/section-238.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, it can include a creditor of the corporation (but not every creditor will qualify),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Frank Roberts|title = Creditor's use of the oppression remedy|url = http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=30298&amp;custom_att_2=direct|publisher = [[McGill University]]|year = 2000|accessdate = {{date|2013-7-2}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a trustee appointed under the ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'' or a monitor appointed under the ''[[Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Ernst &amp; Young Inc v Essar Global Fund Ltd et al|link=|year=2017|court=onsc|num=1366|format=|pinpoint=par. 36-37|parallelcite=|date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the United Kingdom, oppressive conduct is not restricted to that committed by corporations. In the case of corporate directors, the Supreme Court of Canada in 2017 held that they can be held personally liable for such conduct, but only where:

#the oppression remedy request is a fair way of dealing with the situation;
#any order made under s. 241(3) should go no further than necessary to rectify the oppression; and
#any such order may serve only to vindicate the reasonable expectations of security holders, creditors, directors or officers in their capacity as corporate stakeholders; but
#director liability cannot be a surrogate for other forms of statutory or common law relief, particularly where such other relief may be more fitting in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.osler.com/en/resources/regulations/2017/supreme-court-clarifies-test-for-personal-liabilit|title= Supreme Court clarifies test for personal liability of directors for oppressive conduct|last1= O'Brien|first1= Kevin|last2= Carson|first2= Robert|last3= Malik|first3= Waleed|date= July 13, 2017|website= |publisher= [[Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt]]}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Wilson v Alharayeri|link=Wilson v Alharayeri|year=2017|court=scc|num=39|pinpoint=par. 47-55|parallelcite=|date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications to the Court have been successful where:{{sfn|Ben-Ishai|Puri|2004|p=89}}

#there was lack of a valid corporate purpose for the transaction;
#the corporate and its controlling shareholders failed to take reasonable steps to simulate an [[arm's length]] transaction;
#there was lack of good faith on the part of the corporation's directors;
#there was discrimination among shareholders which benefited the majority to the exclusion of the minority;
#there was a lack of adequate and appropriate disclosure of material information to minority shareholders; and
#there was a plan to eliminate a minority shareholder.

The court's discretion is not unlimited, as the [[Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador (Court of Appeal)|Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador]] observed in 2003:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Pelley v. Pelley|link=|year=2003|court=nlca|num=6|format=|pinpoint=par. 37|parallelcite=221 Nfld &amp; PEIR 1  |date=2003-01-22|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The result of the exercise of the discretion contained in subsection 371(3)&lt;ref&gt;of ''NLCA'', equivalent to ''CBCA'', s. 241(3)&lt;/ref&gt; must be the rectification of the oppressive conduct.  If it has some other result the remedy would be one which is not authorized by law.
:* Any rectification of a matter complained of can only be made with respect to the person’s interest as a shareholder, creditor, director or officer.
:* Persons who are shareholders, officers and directors of companies may have other personal interests which are intimately connected to a transaction.  However, it is only their interests as shareholder, officer or director as such which are protected by section 371 of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;''NLCA''&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions of that section cannot be used to protect or to advance directly or indirectly their other personal interests.
:* The law is clear that when determining whether there has been oppression of a minority shareholder, the court must determine what the reasonable expectations of that person were according to the arrangements which existed between the principals.
:* They must be expectations which could be said to have been, or ought to have been, considered as part of the compact of the shareholders.
:* The determination of reasonable expectations will also[...] have an important bearing upon the decision as to what is a just remedy in a particular case.
:* The remedy must not be unjust to the others involved.

Oppression claims are separate from [[derivative action]]s, but the two are not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1 = T. Mark Pontin|author2 = Tracey M.

This is in contrast to the oppression remedy claim, where a complainant sues on behalf of himself for a wrong he suffers personally as a result of corporate conduct.&lt;ref name="Koshal"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadianappeals.com/2015/06/10/pick-your-poison-the-court-of-appeal-clarifies-the-distinction-between-the-oppression-remedy-and-the-derivative-action/|title= Pick Your Poison: the Court of Appeal Clarifies the Distinction between the Oppression Remedy and the Derivative Action|last1= Koshal|first1= Anu|date= June 10, 2015 |publisher= [[McCarthy Tétrault]]}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Rea v Wildeboer|link=|year=2015|court=onca|num=373|parallelcite=126 OR (3d) 178|date=2015-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in Australia==

S. 234 of the ''[[Corporations Act 2001]]'' provides that the following can apply for an order seeking relief for oppressive conduct:

:* a member of the company, on behalf of himself or another member,
:* a person who has been removed from the register of members, or has ceased to be a member under circumstances which are the substance of the application,
:* a person to whom a share in the company has been transmitted by will or by operation of law, or
:* any other person, with the consent of the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]], in connection to a current or prior investigation into the company conducted by ASIC.

S. 232 states that the conduct of the company's affairs, an actual or proposed act or omission by or on behalf of a company, or a resolution or proposed resolution by all, or by a class, of the shareholders, must be:

:* contrary to the interests of the shareholders as a whole; or
:* oppressive to, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, a shareholder or shareholders whether in that capacity or in any other capacity,

in order for an application to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Statutory Oppression Remedy under the ''Corporations Act 2001'' (Cth)|url = http://www.ahernslawyers.com.au/newsletter.asp?ID=8774|publisher = Aherns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oppression remedy, together with the option available for winding up a company and ASIC's use of the public interest ground in that regard, has received greater exposure and legal development since the onset of the [[global financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Oppression and winding up remedies after the GFC|url = |author1 = Michael Legg|author2 = Louisa Travers|journal = [[Company and Securities Law Journal]]|volume = 29|issue = 2|pages = 101{{en dash}}114|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Washington Department of Ecology''''', 511 U.S. 700 (1994), is a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] that interpreted section 401 of the [[Clean Water Act]]. The case involved an application by the [[Jefferson County Public Utility District]] and [[Tacoma City Light]] in northwestern [[Washington (state)|Washington]] to build a [[hydropower]] facility on the [[Dosewallips River]], first proposed in 1982 and known as the "Elkhorn Dam" project. The [[Washington State Department of Ecology]] issued a certification to the project in 1986 that imposed minimum water flow requirements to protect species of [[salmon]] and steelhead under the federal Clean Water Act. Tacoma City Light argued that the dam project would only need to adhere to minimum flow standards set by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC), who license dams. Environmentalist groups argued that the FERC was insensitive to recreation and protection of salmon and steelhead and asked the state to enforce its minimum flow standards.&lt;ref name="Times-Ruling"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pryne |first1=Eric |last2=Williams |first2=Marla |date=May 31, 1994 |title=Supreme Court ruling says states can control water behind dams |page=A1 |work=[[The Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Healy |first=Michael P. |year=1996 |title=The Attraction and Limits of Textualism: The Supreme Court Decision in ''PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v.

The [[Washington State Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the state Department of Ecology on April 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 2, 1993 |title=Stream-flow guidelines OK, high court rules |page=B4 |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was taken to the United States Supreme Court the following year, where the court ruled 7–2 in favor of the state.&lt;ref name="Times-Ruling"/&gt;

==Background==

In 1982, the [[Jefferson County Public Utility District]] (also known as PUD No. 1), in conjunction with [[Tacoma City Light]], proposed the construction of a 10.4-megawatt [[hydroelectric]] dam on the [[Dosewallips River]], near the Elkhorn Campground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lane |first=Bob |date=December 30, 1982 |title=City Light sees problem with small-scale hydropower projects |page=E2 |work=[[The Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dosewallips River, a glacier-fed stream that originates in the [[Olympic Mountains]] and empties into [[Hood Canal]], passes through [[Olympic National Park]] and [[Olympic National Forest]]. The river, described as being in "pristine condition", supports populations of [[salmon]], [[steelhead]] and [[trout]] native to the area.&lt;ref name="WA-1993"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Department of Ecology v. PUD 1 |vol=121 |reporter=Washington Reports |court=Wash. |date=1993 |url=http://courts.mrsc.org/supreme/121wn2d/121wn2d0179.htm |accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jefferson County PUD had looked to damming the Dosewallips River to provide hydroelectricity as well as drinking water to support long-term population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gwinn |first=Mary Ann |date=February 28, 1988 |title=How dry we are: Drought is just one factor in the region's water woes |page=12 |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacoma and Jefferson applied for a water quality certificate from the State of Washington in 1983 as part of requirements outlined by section 401 of the federal [[Clean Water Act]]; the certificate came in addition to a license from the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) before beginning construction. After a two-year environmental study by Tacoma, Jefferson PUD and the state departments of Ecology, Fisheries and Wildlife, and the federal Fish and Wildlife Service, the dam was proposed to maintain minimum in-stream flows of {{convert|65 to 155|cuft}} per second, depending on the month. The [[Washington State Department of Ecology]] issued the section 401 certificate in 1986, with a condition to maintain minimum in-stream flows of {{convert|100 to 200|cuft}} per second.&lt;ref name="WA-1993"/&gt;

Tacoma and Jefferson appealed the in-stream flows requirement to the [[Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board]] (PCHB), who initially ruled in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 17, 1987 |title=Dosewallips dam plan may test state's rights |page=D2 |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Department of Ecology had acted within its authority in placing the requirements in order to preserve the fisheries of the Dosewallips River.&lt;ref name="WA-1993"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January 3, 1988 |title=Tacoma City Light ratepayers may pay more to aid fish runs |page=B6 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a second hearing, the PCHB considered an argument from Tacoma and Jefferson alleging that the Department of Ecology had exceeded its authority in imposing the in-stream flows requirement to enhance the fishery, rather than maintain and preserve it. As a result, the flow rates were reversed by the board, leading to a cross-appeal in the [[Thurston County Superior Court]]. The court ruled in 1991 that the Department of Ecology had the authority to require an enhancement of the Dosewallips fisheries and re-instated their proposed flow rates.&lt;ref name="WA-1993"/&gt;

The case was heard by the [[Washington Supreme Court]] in 1993. The court ruled in favor of the Department of Ecology, finding that the department intended to preserve, not enhance, the Dosewallips fisheries and that the PCHB's findings were erroneous. The court also concluded that the Department of Ecology's permit was valid and was not preempted by the [[Federal Power Act]] and the FERC license.&lt;ref name="WA-1993"/&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
Justice O'Connor authored the opinion of the Court.

==Subsequent developments==

Tacoma City Light withdrew its application for the project in April 1995 and announced the following month that it would abandon plans to build the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=May 2, 1995 |title=Dosewallips Dam scrapped |page=B2 |work=The Seattle Times |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950502&amp;slug=2118753 |accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pandectists''' were German university legal scholars in the early 19th century who studied and taught [[Roman law]] as a model of what they called [[Konstruktionsjurisprudenz]] ([[conceptual jurisprudence]]) as codified in the [[Pandects]] of [[Justinian]] (Berman).

Beginning in the mid-19th century, the Pandectists were attacked in arguments by noted jurists [[Julius Hermann von Kirchmann]] and [[Rudolf von Jhering]] who favored a modern approach of law as a practical means to an end (Weber).

In the United States, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] and other legal realists pushed for laws based on what judges and the courts actually did, rather than the historical and conceptual or academic law of [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] and the Pandectists (Rosenberg).

'''''Powell v. Texas''''', 392 U.S. 514 (1968), was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case which ruled that a Texas statute criminalizing [[public intoxication]] did not violate the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] protection against [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. It was a 5-4 decision, and the majority opinion was by Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]]. Justice [[Hugo Black]] and [[Byron White]] each wrote separate concurring opinions, while Justice [[Abe Fortas]] dissented.

==Background==
The defendant, Leroy Powell, worked in a tavern shining shoes, for which he received approximately $12/week.  Though Powell had a family he provided no support to them; instead, he would use his paycheck to buy wine, which he drank daily, and about once a week to the point of intoxication.&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{ussc|name=Powell v. Texas|volume=392|page=514|pin=|year=1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell was no stranger to the court system; "appellant had been convicted of public intoxication approximately 100 times since 1949, primarily in [[Travis County, Texas]]" (though he had a few convictions in neighboring [[Bastrop County, Texas]]).  Each time, he would be fined $20 (for Travis County offenses) or $25 (for Bastrop County offenses); he would almost always have no means to pay the fine and was thus obliged to work off the fine in jail at the rate of $5/day.&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;

In the specific case, Powell was arrested in Travis County in late December 1966 on yet another public intoxication charge.  His case was heard before the Corporation Court of Austin, Texas (what the Austin [[State court (United States)|municipal court]] was then called); Powell was once again found guilty and was once again fined $20.  This time, though, his defense counsel appealed the conviction to the Travis County Court of Law No. 1 on the grounds that Powell could not be arrested for being an alcoholic.  The County Court heard the case [[trial de novo|de novo]] and Powell was again found guilty, and fined him $50.  As no further appeals were available for Powell within the Texas judicial system, his counsel appealed to the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
===Plurality opinion===
Four members of the Court concluded that Powell, the defendant who was convicted of public intoxication, "was convicted, not for being a chronic alcoholic, but for being in public while drunk on a particular occasion." Therefore, the Texas statute was not criminalizing the condition of [[alcoholism]] alone, but instead punishing the defendant for his public behavior. The majority distinguished the case from the earlier case ''[[Robinson v. California]]'' (1962), which ruled that [[drug addiction]] alone as a disease could not be criminalized.

===Concurring opinions===
Justice Black, joined by Justice Harlan, wrote that striking down public intoxication laws "would significantly limit the States in their efforts to deal with a widespread and important social problem and would do so by announcing a revolutionary doctrine of constitutional law that would also tightly restrict state power to deal with a wide variety of other harmful conduct."

Justice White wrote that there was no Constitutional violation for being arrested while intoxicated in public, and therefore the conviction should stand.

===Dissenting opinion===
Justice Fortas, writing for the dissent, argued that chronic alcoholism was a disease, and in his opinion was no different than the case in ''Robinson'' which involved narcotic addiction.  Therefore, regardless of where the intoxication took place, in his opinion Powell should not have been convicted.

{{Evidence law}}
In the [[Evidence (law)|law of evidence]], a '''privilege''' is a rule of evidence that allows the holder of the privilege to refuse to disclose information or provide evidence about a certain subject or to bar such evidence from being disclosed or used in a judicial or other proceeding.

There are a large number of such privileges recognised by the judicial system, some stemming from the common law and others from statute law. Each privilege has its own rules, which often vary between jurisdictions.

== Types ==
One well known privilege is the [[legal professional privilege|solicitor–client privilege]], referred to as the [[attorney–client privilege]] in the [[United States]] and as the [[Legal professional privilege in Australia|legal professional privilege]] in [[Australia]]. This protects confidential communications between a client and his or her legal adviser for the dominant purpose of legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;''Esso Australia Resources Limited v The Commissioners of Taxation'' (1999) 201 CLR 49;168 ALR 123&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale is that clients ought to be able to communicate freely with their lawyers, in order to facilitate the proper functioning of the legal system. 

Other common forms include privilege against compelled [[self-incrimination]] (in other proceedings), [[without prejudice]] privilege (protecting communications made in the course of negotiations to settle a legal dispute), [[public interest privilege]] (formerly Crown privilege, protecting documents for which secrecy is necessary for the proper functioning of government), [[spousal privilege|spousal (marital) privilege]], [[Physician-patient privilege|medical professional privilege]], and [[priest–penitent privilege |clergy–penitent privilege]].

In the US, several states have enacted the ''Uniform Mediation Act'' (UMA) which specifies a [[mediation|mediator]]'s privilege with regard to state procedures.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974]] provides that evidence relating to spent convictions (those in respect of which the Act says the convicted person is rehabilitated, generally older and less serious ones) is inadmissible, and provides privilege against answering questions relating to such convictions; although some exceptions apply, in particular in criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite legislation UK| type= act| year=1974| chapter=53| act= Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, s. 4(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect ==
The effect of the privilege is usually a right on the part of a party or witness to a case, allowing them to refuse to produce evidence in the form of documents or testimony from the person entitled to the privilege. For example, a person can generally prevent their attorney testifying about the legal relationship between attorney and client, even if the attorney were willing to do so. In this case the privilege belongs to the client and not the attorney.

In a few instances, such as the marital privilege, the privilege is a right held by the potential witness. Thus, if a wife wishes to testify against her husband, she may do so even if he opposes this testimony; however, the wife has the privilege of refusing to testify even if the husband wishes her to do so.

On the other hand, the person entitled to a privilege is at liberty to [[waive]] the privilege.

[[File:SheetMusicCoverAmerHeresMyBoy1917.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sheet music cover for patriotic song, 1917]]

The '''Selective Service Act of 1917''' or '''Selective Draft Act''' ({{USStatute|65|12|40|76|1917|05|18}}) authorized the [[United States federal government]] to raise a national army for [[American entry into World War I|service in World War I]] through [[conscription]]. It was envisioned in December 1916 and brought to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s attention shortly after the break in relations with [[German Empire|Germany]] in February 1917. The Act itself was drafted by then-Captain (later Brigadier General) [[Hugh S. Johnson]] after the United States entered [[World War I]] by declaring war on Germany. The Act was canceled with the end of the war on November 11, 1918. The Act was upheld as constitutional by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1918.&lt;ref name="back" /&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
At the time of World War I, the [[United States Army|US Army]] was small compared with the mobilized armies of the European powers. As late as 1914, the Regular Army had under 100,000 men, while the National Guard (the organized militias of the states) numbered around 115,000. The [[National Defense Act of 1916]] authorized the growth of the Army to 165,000 and the National Guard to 450,000 by 1921, but by 1917 the  Army had only expanded to around 121,000, with the National Guard numbering 181,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark E. |last=Grotelueschen |title=The AEF Way of War: The American Army and Combat in World War I |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1916, it had become clear that any participation by the United States in the conflict in Europe would require a far larger army. While President Wilson at first wished to use only volunteer troops, it soon became clear that this would be impossible. When war was declared, Wilson asked for the Army to increase to a force of one million. But by six weeks after war was declared, only 73,000 men had volunteered for service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Howard |last=Zinn |title=People's History of the United States |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |url=http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinnwarhea14.html |page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson accepted the recommendation of Secretary of War [[Newton D. Baker]] for a draft.

General [[Enoch H. Crowder]], the [[Judge Advocate General of the United States Army]], when first consulted, was opposed. But later, with the assistance of Captain Hugh Johnson and others, Crowder guided the bill through Congress and administered the draft as the [[Provost Marshal General]].

A problem that came up in the writing of the bill and its negotiation through Congress was the desire of former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to assemble a volunteer force to go to Europe. President Wilson and others, including army officers, were reluctant to permit this for a variety of reasons. The final bill contained a compromise provision permitting the president to raise four volunteer divisions, a power Wilson did not exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward M. |last=Coffman |title=The War to End All Wars: The American Military Experience in World War I |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |year=1998 |pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To persuade an uninterested populace to support the war and the draft, [[George Creel]], a veteran of the newspaper industry, became the United States' official war propagandist. He set up the [[Committee on Public Information]], which recruited 75,000 speakers, who made 750,000 four-minute speeches in 5,000 cities and towns across America. Creel later helped form the American Alliance for Labor and Democracy, with union leader [[Samuel Gompers]] as president, to win working-class support for the war and "unify sentiment in the nation". The AALD had branches in 164 cities, and many labor leaders went along although "rank-and-file working class support for the war remained lukewarm...", and the campaign was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Weinstein |title=The Corporate Ideal in the United States 1900–1918 |location=Boston |publisher=Beacon Press |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many prominent Socialist leaders became pro-war, though the majority did not.&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===

By the guidelines set down by the Selective Service Act, all males aged 21 to 30 were required to register to potentially be selected for military service. At the request of the War Department, Congress amended the law in August 1918 to expand the age range to include all men 18 to 45, and to bar further volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;Coffman, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of World War I, some two million men volunteered for various branches of the armed services, and some 2.8 million had been drafted.&lt;ref name="sss_wwi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm|title=Selective Service System: History &amp; Records|accessdate=2005-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that more than half of the almost 4.8 million Americans who served in the armed forces were drafted. Due to the effort to incite a patriotic attitude, the World War I draft had a high success rate, with fewer than 350,000 men [[draft dodger|"dodging" the draft.]]

===Differences from previous drafts===
[[File:Young men registering for military conscription, New York City, June 5, 1917.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Young men at the first national registration day held in association with the Selective Service Act of 1917.]]

The biggest difference between the draft established by the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the [[American Civil War|Civil War draft]] was that substitutes were not allowed. During the Civil War, a drafted man could avoid service by hiring another man to serve in his place. This option was primarily used by wealthy men, and was resented by those who couldn't afford it or considered it dishonorable.

This practice was prohibited in Section Three of the Selective Service Act of 1917:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No person liable to military service shall hereafter be permitted or allowed to furnish a substitute for such service; nor shall any substitute be received, enlisted, or enrolled in the military service of the United States; and no such person shall be permitted to escape such service or to be discharged therefrom prior to the expiration of his term of service by the payment of money or any other valuable thing whatsoever as consideration his release from military service or liability there to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===National registration days and termination===

During World War I there were three registrations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/military/ww1/draft-registration "World War I Draft Registration Cards"], US National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first, on June 5, 1917, was for all men between the ages of 21 and 30.
*The second, on June 5, 1918, registered those who attained age 21 after June 5, 1917. A supplemental registration, included in the second registration, was held on August 24, 1918, for those becoming 21 years old after June 5, 1918.
*The third registration was held on September 12, 1918, for men age 18 through 45.
The Selective Service Act was upheld by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in the ''[[Selective Draft Law Cases]]'', {{ussc|245|366|1918}}. The [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]]'s argument, and the court's opinion, were based primarily on ''Kneedler v. Lane'', 45 Pa. 238, 252 (1863), and [[Emerich de Vattel|Vattel]]'s 1758 treatise ''[[The Law of Nations]]''.&lt;ref name="back"&gt;{{cite book |title=Conscription in the United States: Historical Background |oclc=1727243 |last=Leach |first=Jack Franklin |year=1952 |page=vi |publisher=C.E. Tuttle Pub. Co. |location=Rutland, Vermont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the signing of the armistice of November 11, 1918, the activities of the Selective Service System were rapidly curtailed. On March 31, 1919, all local, district, and medical advisory boards were closed, and on May 21, 1919, the last state headquarters closed operations. The Provost Marshal General was relieved from duty on July 15, 1919, thereby finally terminating the activities of the Selective Service System of World War I.

==Draft categories==
Conscription was by class. The first candidates were to be drawn from Class I. Members of each class below Class I were available only if the pool of all available and potential candidates in the class above it were exhausted.

==African-Americans==
[[Racial segregation in the United States Armed Forces|The American military was entirely segregated]] at the time of World War I. While the Army had several regiments of black "[[Buffalo Soldier]]s", many white supremacist politicians such as Sen. [[James K. Vardaman]] (D-Mississippi) and Sen. [[Benjamin Tillman]] (D-South Carolina) staunchly opposed any expanded military role for black Americans. Nevertheless, the War Department decided to include blacks in the draft.&lt;ref name=Williams53&gt;{{cite book |first=Chad L. |last=Williams |title=Torchbearers of Democracy: African American Soldiers in the World War I Era |location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=2010 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 290,527 black Americans were ultimately registered for the draft during the two calls of June 2 and September 12, 1917 – 9.6 percent of the total American pool for potential conscription.&lt;ref name=Williams53 /&gt;

Draft board officials were told to tear off the lower left-hand corner of the Selective Service form of a black registrant, indicating his designation for segregated units.&lt;ref name=Williams53 /&gt; The August 1917 [[Houston Riot (1917)|Houston Riot]], when armed black soldiers fired upon Houston police and civilians, also affected the War Department's decision-making. The great majority of black soldiers were employed only in labor functions, such as road-building and freight-handling.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Torchbearers of Democracy'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Only two black combat units of were ultimately established – the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd]] and [[93rd Infantry Division (United States)|93rd Infantry Divisions]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Torchbearers of Democracy'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Black Americans were entirely excluded from the [[United States Marine Corps]] and were consigned to menial labor in the [[United States Navy]] for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Torchbearers of Democracy'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Africa]] rewrote its [[nationality law]] since the end of [[Apartheid]] in 1994 and the establishment of majority rule in the country under the [[African National Congress]]. The 1995 South African Citizenship Act did away with the previous Apartheid-era 1949 and 1970 acts which had established separate [[bantustan]] citizenship to the country's African majority and inferior levels of citizenship to the country's [[Asian people|Asian]] and [[coloured]] minorities.

==Citizenship by birth ==

According to Chapter 2 of the 1995 law, anyone who was considered to be a "citizen by birth" prior to the enactment of the law or who is born in the Republic on or after the enactment of the law is a citizen by birth. Also, a person is a "citizen by birth" if they can be considered a [[#Citizenship by descent|citizen by descent]] and at the time of birth at least one parent was: 1) in the service of the government, 2) was employed by a person or group located in the Republic, or 3) was in the service of an international organization in which South Africa had membership.&lt;ref name=act&gt;{{cite web|title=South African Citizenship Act|url=http://www.gov.za/sites/www.gov.za/files/a88-95_1.pdf|publisher=South African Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an exception to the birthright citizenship provision: those born to visiting foreign diplomats or their employees, or nonresident aliens are not considered to be "citizens by birth" (unless their other parent is a citizen, in which case they are a citizen by birth).

== Citizenship by descent ==

Under the 1995 law, a person born outside South Africa to a South African parent is a South African citizen by descent upon registration of the birth under South African law. Those who did not retain their Citizenship after they applied for another Citizenship cannot transmit their previously held Citizenship.

==Naturalisation ==

Under Section 5 of the 1995 act, Citizenship can be acquired by adults through [[naturalisation]] if the following conditions are met:

*Valid residence permit or Certificate of Exemption;
*One year of ordinary residence in South Africa prior to the application for naturalisation;
*Four years of physical (actual) residence in South Africa during the eight years before the application for naturalisation, excluding the year of ordinary residence;
*In the case of an applicant for naturalisation being married in a spousal relationship with a South African citizen, two years of permanent residence and two years of marriage/spousal relationship to the South African citizen spouse prior to the application;
*Be of good and sound character;
*Intend to remain resident in South Africa, work for a South African government, work in an international organisation in which South Africa is a member, or work for a person or organisation resident or established in South Africa;
*Be able to communicate in any one of South Africa's official languages satisfactorily;
*Have adequate knowledge of the duties and responsibilities of a South African citizen.
Naturalisation of an adult also confers South African citizenship upon that adult's minor children.

===Loss of citizenship by naturalised South Africans===

Naturalised South Africans who left South Africa before 6 October 1988 and did not obtain a 'Letter of Exemption' from the South African authorities may have lost South African citizenship after seven years absence.

==Visa free travel==
[[File:Visa requirements for South African citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for South African citizens]] {{legend|red|South Africa|border=1px #555 solid}} {{legend|#22b14c|Visa-free|border=1px #555 solid}} {{legend|greenyellow|Visa on arrival|border=1px #555 solid}}{{legend|#99d9ea|Electronic visa available|border=1px #555 solid}}{{legend|#B5A29B|Pre-approved visa pick up on arrival|border=1px #555 solid}}{{legend|lightgrey|Visa required|border=1px #555 solid}}]]
{{Main|Visa requirements for South African citizens}}
Visa requirements for South African citizens are administrative entry restrictions enforced by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[South Africa]]. In 2017, South African citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 98 countries and territories, ranking the South African passport 55th in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Visa Restrictions Index]]. Presently, South African citizens have visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 103 countries, according the February 2018 score ranking the South African passport 53rd in the world. There are many exemptions for South African citizens in lieu of obtaining a visa if in possession of an '''Exemption Document''', see [[Visa requirements for South African citizens]].

==Dual nationality==

Prior to 2004, South Africa in principle did not recognise the [[multiple citizenship]] of its nationals unless the citizen applied for an exemption or permission letter under a 1995 law permitting South African citizens to travel using foreign passports.

Since 2004, South African dual nationals may travel without hindrance as long as they enter and leave South Africa on their [[South African passport]]s. Dual nationals may petition for temporary, emergency or "permanent" South African passports for this purpose.

However, a South African citizen  who by a formal and voluntary act acquires the citizenship of another country, automatically loses his or her South African [[Nationality|citizenship]] unless they apply for, and receive permission to retain their South African citizenship '''before''' acquiring the citizenship of the new country{{ref|retention}}. A naturalized citizen however cannot apply for such a retention under the law. There is not a specific requirement to do so if residing in South Africa or if the claim is inevitable such as a dual Zimbabwean-South Africa possessing the Right of Abode in the UK then registering as a British Citizen but it is advised by the Department of Home Affairs. If a South African Citizen wishes to restore a previously lost Citizenship (usually by birth or of their ancestors) due to acquiring Citizenship of another country, for instance citizenship of one of the territories that the Soviet Union controlled, then it is not a Voluntary or Formal Act when applying and retention of South African Citizenship is not necessary. A South African citizen cannot possess the Right of Abode in the United Kingdom as they were not Commonwealth Citizens in 1983 unless they are a Commonwealth Citizen of another country, however if due to registration, British Citizenship and the Right of Abode is given simultaneously.

South African citizens under the age of eighteen (18) years are exempt from the retention requirement and do not require permission as long as they acquire the foreign citizenship before their eighteen (18th) birthday by their parent's right or application. They automatically retain their South African citizenship for life unless; once they have reached the age of 18, they wish to acquire a further foreign citizenship. They will then have to apply for prior permission to retain their South African citizenship – failing to do so, they will automatically lose their South African citizenship.{{ref|minorcitizenact1995}}

These laws are not heavily guarded thus entering South Africa with a South African Passport will immediately suggest the holder's Citizenship.

Entering South Africa on a foreign or another Commonwealth Passport is illegal when in the possession of South African Citizenship. If the holder is assumed to have renounced their South African Citizenship because there is no evidence to suggest that they are presently 'once were' South African, then they may pass under the assumption of another/ that citizen but when it is seems that they are a South African Citizen, then may they face interrogation when entering or leaving South Africa when entering on another passport. An example of a person still holding South African Citizenship to the officer would be: a child (under 18) seeking entry with a British Citizen Passport describing them as below 18, having been born in Republic of South Africa and the child's birth certificate stating their parent's place of birth and citizenship as South Africa. This provision of the Citizenship Act (section 26(B)) only applies to adults ("major citizens").&lt;ref&gt;http://citizenshiprightsafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/South-Africa-Citizenship-Act-1995-as-amended-to-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who previously held South African Citizenship (other than by naturalization) are always entitled to permanent residence in South Africa and may apply to resume (naturalize) their South African citizenship after indefinitely returning so long there is sufficient proof of previously held South African Citizenship. The Permanent Residence holder will then be required to reside in South Africa until (they) become eligible to restore or naturalize as a South African Citizen.  The application for resumption of South African citizenship requires proof of residence in South Africa for one year immediately prior to the application.  Municipal rates and other utility bills are usually accepted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.passport2000.com/files/bi-175.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who naturalized after obtaining Permanent Residence (South African Citizenship not by birth or descent or registration ) cannot apply for Permanent Residence then Citizenship through their claim to previously being a South African Citizen as previously stated unless (they) re-reside in South Africa on a pathway to possible Permanent Residence with an eligible Visa again. This is not applicable to those who were born in South Africa or the UK and former Colonies or obtained their Citizenship by Descent and have since lost it.

Many South Africans have claims to another citizenship (see: [[Demographics of South Africa]]).

== British nationality ==
{{British subjects}}The information below is informative and should be viewed as a summary of the influence and History of the presence of the British Nationality Law in South Africa as well as the present effects and entitlements:
* Prior to 1 January 1949, present day South African citizens of the former {{flag|Union of South Africa}} (whilst it was part of the Crown's Dominions) were regarded as [[British subject]]s under British Colonional law (1910-1948) and were [[British Subjects]] of the individual colonies that formed the Union prior to 1910, both for the dominion and colonies, irrespective of how they acquired Citizenship, whether born in South Africa or some other territory or country in the British Empire including the UK itself. British Nationality Law expanded after this time of which many former Dominions developed their own Nationality Acts including South Africa. See [[British nationality law]].
* Between 1 January 1949 and 1 September 1949, South Africans remained ''[[British subjects without citizenship]]'' even if they had already acquired citizenship of the UK &amp; Colonies or of another British Commonwealth country and continued to possess a British Passport for the Union of South Africa with the status “British Subject” endorsed. Before this period, many dominions had already gained autonomy under the 1926 Balfour Declarations and then under the Statute of Westminster in 1931, a high level of self-governance acting almost as an sovereign country but within the Crown sovereignty. The term "Dominion" was conveived prior to 1926, thus the definition has changed throughout time, in particular from 1926, afterwhich all Dominions eventually developed their own Nationality Acts as a form of self-identity, most acts were enforced after 1948 (such as Canada). The British Crown's Dominions (e.g.: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and so forth...) operated their own Immigration laws both before and after 1949 but the Queen's Subject's commonly shared the Status of British Subject (until 1983) despite Nationality Laws having not been invented for most of them before 1949 which meant that *certain British Subjects from other parts of the British Empire required permission to land in other parts of the Crown's Dominions. All British Subjects from the Crown's Dominions then later the British Commonwealth Countires/ Realms (after 1949) could move freely between the Colonoies of the U.K. and United Kingdom until 1961. A Realm after 1949 is essentially what is known today as a Commonwealth Realm where Her Majesty the Queen, Elizabeth II provides for the Constitutional Monarch, however this differs from absolute Monarchy such as in the case of a Dynastic Rule in some Middle Eastern countries. Dominions and Realms are not comparable today, Dominions operated on a high level of self-goverence whilst they were controlled by the British Government in certain respects such as by representation in defence.
* [Subject to interpretation].

=== Citizenship of the UK and its colonies ===

* On 2 September 1949, most British subjects without UK &amp; Colonies Citizenship from South Africa acquired South African Citizenship if they had a connection to South Africa (e.g. Birth or Residence or by Descent), whilst simultaneously retaining the status of a British Subject of '''the Crown''' and being a Citizen of the newly independent South Africa part of the British Commonwealth of Nations as a Realm. The status acquired was British Subject: Citizen of the Union of South Africa/ Union National, a British  Commonwealth Nation.
* Those who did not become South African generally became (citizens) of the UK &amp; Colonies or remained British Subjects without Citizenship provided that they had no connections with any other Commonwealth Realm or the Republic of Ireland (Eire), but this was infrequent as citizenship acquisition was enforced upon the newly independent Commonwealth Nations for the British Subjects if they were eligible. Such persons (CUKC) would have acquired British citizenship in 1983 if they had the [[Right of Abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]] in the UK on the 31st of December 1982, otherwise they would have become British Overseas Citizens (BOC). Those who acquired BOC after as a result of their stand alone British Subject status (non-citizen) without the Right of Abode are likely British Overseas Citizens; prior to the revolution of the 1980s nationality act. 
* Those of an ethnic Indian or Pakistani background who were British subjects before 1949, but did not acquire South African citizenship upon the enforcement of the law in 1949, may have remained ''British subjects without citizenship''. These individuals can possibly Register as British Citizens provided they have no other nationality and have resided in South Africa with their British Subject status from the period of enforcement in present-day South Africa. The British Subjects without Citizenship May have been a South African Citizen already. See [[Indian nationality law]]
* British Overseas citizens and British subjects who have no other nationality, and have not lost or renounced another nationality since 4 July 2002, may register as British citizens under s4B of the British Nationality Act 1981 without requiring UK residence under certain conditions of the Act. This facility has been available since 30 April 2003 due to the statuses not having present day value and in particular British Subjects were there is no country of Right to Settle/ or of Permanent Residence. Those who have immigrated to the UK may have additional options for acquiring British citizenship such as naturalization through marriage or registration as a British Citizen in the UK which would enable the status to be transmitted by Descent.

=== Citizenship between 1949 and 1961===

Between 1949 and 1961, all South African citizens remained ''British subjects'' by virtue of their South African citizenship whilst South Africa remained an independent Commonwealth nation, this was known as a Dominion prior to 1949, similarly in what is known today as a Commonwealth citizen under the U.K. Nationality Law. During this period South Africans were regarded as: [British Subject: Citizen of the Union of South Africa/ Union National, a British Commonwealth Nation/ Citizen]. The passport’s format was similar to a CUKC passport and included the words “British Subject” inside as with all Commonwealth realms at the time.

This was ended in 1961 when South Africa left the British Commonwealth on becoming a Republic, and formally abandoned all of its connections, with Union nationals becoming citizens of the Republic of South Africa. By the time South Africa returned to the Commonwealth in 1994, the phrase "British Subject" had been replaced by "[[Commonwealth citizen]]". Australia was the last to phase out British Subject in the Citizenship law which was in 1986.

The full title of a South African Citizen presently is: '''''Republic of South African Citizen, a Commonwealth Citizen either * with or without the Right of Abode in the United Kingdom''''' ''(formerly British Subject).''
* Since South Africa has not been a full member for the purposes of the Law, it is not possible for a South African Citizen to possess the Right of Abode in the United Kingdom as a status unless they were a citizen of another Commonwealth nation before the 1st of January, 1983 including the United Kingdom, in case the right can be established in the South African passport.

===[[Right of Abode (United Kingdom)| right of abode]] and Citizenship Acquisition of the {{flag|United Kingdom}}===
Right of Abode is the right for its holder to remain in the UK indefinitely (indefinite relationship) without immigration control or restrictions as long as the right can be proved. It is viewed as a status greater than Indefinite Leave to Enter/ Remain (also referred to as Permanent Residency).

Holders of Right of Abode (except British Citizens) must have a Certificate of Entitlement in their passport as proof that their right exists or describing them as a British Subject with the Right of Abode in their British Subject Passport or hold a British Citizen (ROE co-exists with British Citizenship). Those who hold the ROE as a stand-alone status without Citizenship of the United Kingdom must be a Commonwealth Citizen, also applicable to some (British) Nationals which include some British Subjects and some British Overseas Citizens. All British Citizens have the ROE, however ulike British Citizenship which contains the Right of Abode regardless of personal circumstances, the Right of Abode as a Commonwealth Citizen including some forms of British Nationality can be revoked in cases such as in criminal conduct or applications made in fraud which are assessed incorrectly.

As South Africa was a foreign country (under United Kingdom law) between 1 January 1973, the date the [[Immigration Act 1971]] came into force in the UK, and 1 January 1983 (when the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] came into force) South African Citizens cannot have right of abode in the UK unless they also held before 1983 and still hold citizenship of another Commonwealth country (such as by descent from their parent, e.g. Australia or Zimbabwe which did not cease to be Commonwealth Nations under U.K. Law) or of the UK itself, the holders would most likely have acquired that Citizenship by descent from a parent who was a Citizen of that Commonwealth Country at the time of their birth or through marriage. A Present Day Commonwealth country refers to any country within the Commonwealth of Nations, for instance, Australia, New Zealand or Canada. Since Queen Elizabeth II is not the head of state in South Africa (Queen/ monarch), as South Africa is a Republic, the Queen is the head of the Commonwealth of Nations only and is not the Constitutional Monarch which is the case for systems of the Monarchy for 16 of the Commonwealth nations which are known as realms (including the United kingdom).

This particularly affects South Africans born before 1983 to a British mother, who would have otherwise acquired the right of abode in the UK on the 1st of January, 1983. Many South Africans possessing Zimbabwean Citizenship have the Right of Abode if their mother was born in the UK prior to 1983 even though Zimbabwe is not part of the Commonwealth under their own laws, but has since applied to re-join or “re-establish” the connection.

&lt;big&gt;'''British Nationality'''&lt;/big&gt;: Citizenship of the {{flag|United Kingdom}}

However, the changes to [[British nationality law]] on 30 April 2003 have since allowed those born in South Africa between 8 February 1961 and 31 December 1982 to a UK-born, naturalized or registered citizen mother to apply for registration as a British citizen (by descent) [which is a less regarded version of British Citizenship by Birth or Naturalization or *some registrations] and with this comes the right of abode in the UK as British Citizenship coexists with the Right Of Abode. This could also enable Citizenship to be passed onto the Grandchildren in various circumstances. This concession is not specific to South African citizens, this applies to all countries including non-Commonwealth realms and members such as the United States and its territories.

It remains very difficult to obtain many documents from South Africa's Department of Home Affairs for registration. Nationality was not considered something of great significance prior to 1983 (before many governments enforced major immigration changes),  nor was this communicated by the U.K. Government frequently unless enquired about usually from the High Commissions. Travel was limited from South Africa due to strict laws imposed by the Apartheid regime, thus many individuals have misplaced their documents which could very well have helped many apply for Registration as a British Citizen by Descent today, many also never requested them.

For those with a UK born mother, it is important to note that applying for a UK Visa is particularly difficult as South Africa was not always part of the British Commonwealth although is part of the new Commonwealth. The individuals affected are those born to British mothers between 1961 and 1982. The rule of who can possess the Right of Abode is very controversial but in most instances, those who apply for a Visa will generally have their applications refused. Those who later apply for a Certificate of Entitlement as an alternative entry method will also have their applications refused  which then leaves them in a difficult situation whereby both the Certificate of Entitlement and UK Standard Victor Visa (C) are usually refused due to the officer not being aware of these restrictions when a British-born mother is mentioned in applications. Therefore, it is imperative to make a claim to register as a British Citizen by Descent if born to a British Mother prior to 1983 to avoid any travel complications. The only associated cost is the Certificate of Citizenship collection of £80.00 as of September 2018.

Registration as a British Citizen by marriage is also one of the common ways to register if married to a British man prior to 1983.

It is possible to obtain British citizenship by double descent (from the grandparent) in numerous instances by registration of which some include:

1) +The parent of the child has the Right of Abode and is some form of a British National (e.g. British Citizen) by descent and has spent 3 years in the UK either prior to their birth or before their 18th birthday which would allow their '''minor child''' to become registered through the child's grandparent as long as it is within a specific timeframe (must be registered before the child turns 18), child does not have to live in the UK.

2)There is substantial proof that the Grandparent is/ was a British Citizen, their child was either born in a former Colony (between a certain number of years) or did not possess a passport, this will ultimately enable the grandchild to apply for British Citizenship by Registration but the law makes it unclear whether the parent would first have to be British / obtain or possess th ROA. This would essentially confer British Citizenship by 'Double Descent'.

3) Another way is if the mother registered before 1983, the  child could potentially become registered.

4) There is the possibility for a child to become Registered as a British Citizen from their British Grandfather if the child's parent became British by Descent at birth automatically but was not able to register her child's birth at the High Commission due to discrimination in the past: the ability in the case: Grandfather whose female child had a child can apply to register.

Other ways include:

5) Children born prior tp 2006 to an unmarried British father can Register as a British Citizen.

Registration: The term registration refers to gaining British Citizenship where it was previously not available (obtained).

Registration of different forms can make one a Citizen by Descent, by Marriage and even by Double Descent in some instances, and so forth.

Since claims by double descent are very difficult and require an explanation, the UK Ancestry Visa was introduced (read below); this enables the acquisition of Citizenship in the form of ''otherwise than by descent'' by Naturalization which can be transmitted by descent upon a successful application for British Citizenship after meeting the basic residence requirement of 5 year then a further 1 year as the holder of Indefinite Leave to Remain/ Enter, whereas Citizenship by Double ''Descent'' can only be transmitted in limited circumstances.

+Registering as a British Citizen can sometimes assist the child of the grandparent to become British as Registration generally refers to (otherwise than by descent).

'''Naturalization''' is a process of becoming a British Citizen after meeting a residence requirement of 5 years, then a further one year as a ' Permanent Resident' which differs from registration where there is generally no residence requirement.

As for people '''born''' on or after 1 January 1983, they can only possess the Right of Abode to the United Kingdom if they hold British Citizenship.

If South Africa had remained a Permanent Member of the Commonwealth, those born prior to 1983 to British mothers would have possessed the Right of Abode however, those born after 1983 are British Citizens '''by descent''' and can chose whether to have a Certificate of Entitlement in their South African (Commonwealth) Passport or hold a British Passport irrespective of the fact that South Africa became a Commonwealth Nation again in 1994 (period of rejoining), women could only pass on their citizenship after 1983.

Much of what is seen above is based on previous gender discriminatory laws where children could not enjoy the same rights had their father's been British at the time of birth and is a summary only.

===Commonwealth citizenship {{flag|Commonwealth of Nations}} in the {{flag|United Kingdom}}===

Following South Africa's return to the Commonwealth in 1994, South Africans are treated as ''Commonwealth citizens'' in the United Kingdom and amongst other Commonwealth Countries (formerly British Subjects). This includes the following benefits:

* eligibility for the UK Working Holiday Visa scheme (no longer available since November 2008 (non-specific))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1stcontactenews.co.uk/post/UK-Working-Holidays-e28093-A-Thing-of-the-Past-for-SA.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215002345/http://www.1stcontactenews.co.uk/post/UK-Working-Holidays-e28093-A-Thing-of-the-Past-for-SA.aspx |archivedate=15 February 2009 |title=UK Working Holidays – A Thing of the Past for SA |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* eligibility for the UK Ancestry Visa (for those with a UK-born grandparent):
This is a five year's entry clearance (visa) which enables the holder to eventually apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain/ Enter (Permanent Residence) after five years of stay then eventually British Citizenship after a waiting period of one-year by Naturalization, which is in total 6 years of residence. Children (minor) of the qualifier are encouraged to join the UK Ancestry Visa holder as a dependent prior to their eighteenth as they will not be able to join the qualifier in the UK at the age of majority and will therefore be required to make their own method of entry unless they decide to join their parent's by switching from a Visa other than the Standard Visitor Visa (whilst in the UK) or whilst the parent is a Permanent Resident which is on an unlimited-time Family Visa, the child could become a British Citizen as well at a later date. There is no age restrictions for spouses. It is important to note that unlike other UK Work Visas, the Ancestry Visa cannot be revoked as it is ancestral right. Once the right is established, it is indefinite but the Visa will always need to be valid in order to use that right for entry/ re-entry into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Thus, if a Five Year Entry Clearance/ Visa is approved, it will be the qualifier's responsibility to ensure that the visa is valid throughout the length (they) anticipate to remain in the UK and Crown Dependencies. Once the initial Visa expires, it can be extended whilst in the UK or a new Visa can be applied for outside the UK but the right would then need to be re-established (not applicable for extensions of visas from the UK). It should be noted that border processing is less demanding when in possession a UK Ancestry Visa.

* the right, if +resident in the UK, to vote and hold public office in the UK
* the right to possess a British Emergency passport as a South African Citizen (Commonwealth Citizen) which is valid for one-year when there is no South African consulate or other Commonwealth consulate available.

+A non-British Citizen from another Commonwealth Nation residing in the UK can simply vote.

There are no specific concessions in terms of eligibility for British citizenship, and South Africans must meet the same rules for registration or naturalisation as citizens of any other foreign country. It was however possible for a citizen of the British Commonwealth (other than UK) to register as a British Subject: Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) prior to 1983 after 1 year's residence or even register without residing before 1961. South Africans that were in the United Kingdom after South Africa became a Republic were permitted to stay and even register as a CUKC. Those that left but did not register may have a Settled Status and can now register as a British Citizen. Those who do not have a Settled Status may apply for a Resident Return Visa if they are part of the Windrush Countries: Commonwealth Citizens that left the United Kingdom or never left.

{{History of Indonesia}}

The '''Supersemar''', the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] abbreviation for ''''Surat Perintah Sebelas Maret'''' (Order of Eleventh March), was a document signed by the [[Indonesian President]] [[Sukarno]] on 11 March 1966, giving the army commander Lt. Gen. [[Suharto]] authority to take whatever measures he "deemed necessary" to restore order to the chaotic situation during the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66]]. The abbreviation "Supersemar" is a play on the name of [[Semar]], the mystic and powerful figure who commonly appears in Javanese mythology including [[wayang]] puppet shows. The invocation of Semar was presumably intended to help draw on Javanese mythology to lend support to Suharto's legitimacy during the period of the transition of authority from Sukarno to Suharto.

In effect, the Supersemar came to be seen as the key instrument of the transfer of executive power from Sukarno to Suharto.

==Background==
[[File:Supersemar I.JPG|left|150px|thumb|One version of the document]]
On 30 September 1965, a group calling itself the [[30 September Movement]] killed six senior army generals, seized temporary control of parts of the center of [[Jakarta]] and issued a number of decrees over Republic of Indonesia Radio.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFS269"&gt;Ricklefs (1982) p269&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suharto]] and his allies defeated the movement and in the rather drawn-out process which extended out for six months or more, Sukarno's formal position as president of the nation was slowly but steadily ebbed away. The armed forces accused its long-standing rival, the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI), of being behind the "coup attempt" and an [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|anti-Communist purge]] ensued. Over the next few months Suharto and the armed forces seized the initiative. During a cabinet meeting (which Suharto did not attend), while student demonstrations protected by the army took place in Jakarta, troops without insignia surrounded the presidential palace where the meeting was being held. It later transpired that these were from Army [[Kopassus|special forces]]. Sukarno was advised to leave the meeting and did so, flying to the presidential palace in [[Bogor]], 60&amp;nbsp;km south of Jakarta, by helicopter. Later that afternoon three army generals, Maj. Gen. [[Basuki Rahmat]], Minister for Veteran Affairs, Brig. Gen. [[M Jusuf]],  Minister for Basic Industry and Brig. Gen. [[Amirmachmud]], Commander of the 5th Military Region/Jaya, visited Sukarno and came away with the signed Supersemar which they then presented to Suharto. The next day Suharto used the powers thus conferred on him to ban the PKI, and on 18 March, fifteen Sukarno loyalist ministers were arrested. &lt;ref name="RICKLEFS274275"&gt;Ricklefs (1982) pp274-275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCHWARZ25"&gt;Schwarz (1999) p25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CROUCH187192"&gt;Crouch (2007) pp187-192&lt;/ref&gt;

Suharto changed the composition of the Provisional [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPRS) and a year later, in March 1967, the MPRS voted to strip Sukarno of his powers and appointed Suharto acting president. In 1968 the MPRS removed the word 'acting' and over two years after the events of September 1965 Suharto became the president of Indonesia. The process of transferring the presidency from Sukarno to Suharto had taken over two years. Suharto remained in power as president until he resigned in during the [[Indonesian Revolution of 1998|political crisis in Indonesia]] in May 1998.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFS269"&gt;Ricklefs (1982) p269&lt;/ref&gt;

==The document==
The Supersemar itself is a simple document of less than 200 words. It reads as follows:&lt;ref name="SEKNEG"&gt;Sekretariat Negara Republik Indonesia (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===The circumstances surrounding the signing of the Supersemar===
Indonesians usually end documents with the place and date of signing of the document. Given that the Supersemar was supposedly signed in Bogor, it is odd that the Supersemar is signed "Djakarta".  In his account of the events of March 1966, Hanafi, a close friend of Sukarno and ambassador to [[Cuba]] says that he went to Bogor on 12 March and met with Sukarno. He says that Sukarno told him Suharto had sent three generals with a document they had already prepared for him to sign. He says that Sukarno felt he had to sign it because he was in a tight spot, but that the generals had promised to defend Sukarno and that the order would not be misused.&lt;ref name="HANAFI"&gt;Hanafi (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Martoidjojo, the commander of the presidential bodyguard, who went with Sukarno in the helicopter to Bogor, says that the Supersemar was typed in Bogor by Sukarno's adjutant and military secretary, Brig. Gen. Mochammed Sabur.&lt;ref name="MARTO"&gt;Martoidjojo (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Djamaluddin corroborates this.&lt;ref name="DJAMA"&gt;Djamaluddin (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the Supersemar itself could be read as a threat, namely the section reading "to guarantee the personal safety and authority of the leadership" of Sukarno. However, in 1998, accusations appeared&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;Center of Information Analysis (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; of an even more direct threat, namely that two members of the presidential guard had seen Gen. M. Jusuf and Gen M. Panggabean, second assistant to the Army minister, pointing their pistols at Sukarno. M. Jusuf and others have denied this, and that Panggabean was even present. They called into doubt the credibility of key parts of the accusations, and said it was impossible for the two men to be so close to the president at the time.

===The disappearance of the original===
One of difficulties in historical research regarding the Supersemar is that the original document can no longer be found. When then-Vice President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] ordered the [[Indonesian National Archives]] to find it, they reported they only had two copies, one issued by the Army's Information Centre and another by the State Secretary, and that there were significant differences between them.&lt;ref name="Fic2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fic|first=Victor M.|title=Anatomy of the Jakarta Coup, October 1, 1965: The Collusion with China which Destroyed the Army Command, President Sukarno and the Communist Party of Indonesia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yHAP2FwArpwC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=9 March 2018|year=2005|publisher=Yayasan Obor Indonesia|isbn=9789794615546|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The existence of multiple versions===
[[File:Supersemar signatures.JPG|left|220px|thumb|Signatures of Sukarno on the four versions]]
One of the publications to appear since the fall of Suharto alleges that there were several versions of the Supersemar.&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt; Even before the fall of Suharto, an official publication commemorating 30 years of Indonesian independence reproduced one version of Supersemar, while an officially sanctioned high school history textbook featured a different version.&lt;ref name="SEKNEG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHANIAGO"&gt;Chaniago ''et al.'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of differences between the various versions of the Supersemar:

* In two versions, there is a missing plural marker after the word "force" (''Angkatan'') in section III, paragraph 2
* In the same two versions, there is an extra definite article marker after the word "responsibilities" (''tanggung-djawab") in section III paragraph 3
* One version runs to two pages, whereas the other versions are all on the one page.
* Sukarno's signature in one version lacks the dot-and-horizontal-line after the word "Soekarno".
* There are also minor differences in the proximity and shapes of the letters.&lt;ref name="PAMBUDI"&gt;Pambudi (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Order of 13 March===
According to Hanafi, in his discussions with Sukarno at the Bogor Palace on 12 March, Sukarno was angry that the Supersemar had been used to ban the PKI, as it was the prerogative of the president to ban political parties. He said he had asked Third Deputy Prime Minister [[Johannes Leimena]] to take a written order to Suharto, and that he would wait to see what Suharto's reaction was – whether he would obey it or not. He asked Hanafi to help Third Deputy Prime Minister Chaerul Saleh and First Deputy Prime Minister [[Subandrio]] The two men showed Hanafi the "Order of 13 March", which stated that the Order of 11 March was technical and administrative in nature, not political, warned General Suharto that he was not to take any actions outside the scope of the order and asked Suharto to report to the president at the palace. Saleh planned to make copies of the order and distribute them to loyal members of the palace guard and to Sukarno's young followers. Hanafi says 5,000 copies were made, and that he took a few back to Jakarta with him, but he does not know what happened to the others.&lt;ref name="HANAFI"/&gt;

In the official biography of Suharto, it is also said that Sukarno questioned Suharto's use of the Supersemar and sent Leimena to ask Suharto to take responsibility for his actions.&lt;ref name="DWIPSJAM"&gt;Dwipayana and Sjamsuddin (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Saelan, deputy commander of the presidential guard says Suharto ignored the order,&lt;ref name="SAELAN"&gt;Saelan (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hanafi says that Suharto sent a message back via Leimena, who returned to Bogor later that evening, saying he would take responsibility for his actions, and that he was unable to come to Bogor as he was due to attend a meeting of all the military commanders at 11&amp;nbsp;am the following day, to which he invited Sukarno. Incidentally, Hanafi is ambiguous as to the dates in his account, as he says he was in Bogor on 12 March, but the "correction" to the Supersemar was known as the Order of 13 March.&lt;ref name="HANAFI"/&gt;

"'''The Engineering of Consent'''" is an [[essay]] by [[Edward Bernays]] first published in 1947, and a [[#Book|book]] he published in 1955.

==Overview==

In his own words, Bernays describes engineering consent as "use  of  an  engineering  approach—that is, action  based  only  on   thorough  knowledge of  the  situation  and  on  the  application  of  scientific  principles  and  tried practices  to  the  task  of  getting  people to   support   ideas   and  programs." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernays|first1=Edward|title=The engineering of consent.|date=1969|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=9780806103280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernays explained, "Professionally, [public relations] activities are planned and executed by trained practitioners in accordance with scientific principles, based on the findings of [[social scientist]]s. Their dispassionate approach and methods may be likened to those of the engineering professions which stem from the [[physical science]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Bernays 1955 page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat of engineered consent in democracy has been expressed in a textbook on American government:&lt;ref&gt;John C. Livingston &amp; Robert G. Thompson (1966) ''The Consent of the Governed'', 2nd edition, page 11, [[Collier Macmillan]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Under modern conditions of political advertising and manipulation, it has become possible to talk of the engineering of consent by an elite of experts and professional politicians. Consent that is thus engineered is difficult to distinguish in any fundamental way from the consent that supports modern totalitarian governments. Were the manipulated voter to become the normal voter, the government he supports could hardly be said to rest on his consent in any traditional sense of that word.

To some observers, [[Consumer psychology|consumer psychologists]] have already made the choice for people before they buy a certain product. [[Marketing]] is often based on themes and symbols that unconsciously influence consumer behavior.

| dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author's observations in the essay include the following:
* The United States has become a small room where a single whisper is magnified thousands of times.
* There are two divisions in media: commercial and organized group information systems.
* Today’s leaders have become more remote physically from the public, yet, at the same time, the public has much greater familiarity with these leaders through the system of modern communications...Increased influence of mass media is due to widespread and enormously rapid diffusion of [[literacy]].
* With the aid of technicians in the field who have specialized in utilizing the channels of communications, [some leaders] have been able to achieve purposefully and scientifically what we have termed "the engineering of consent".
* The freedoms of press, speech, petition and assembly, the freedoms which make the engineering of consent possible, are among the most cherished guarantees in the Constitution of the United States.
* Under no circumstances should the engineering of consent supersede or displace the educational system, either formal or informal, in bringing about understanding by the people as the basis for their actions. The engineering of consent often does supplement the educational process.
* The chief function [of the profession] is to analyze objectively and realistically the position of its client vis-a-vis a public, and to advise as to the necessary corrections in its client’s attitudes towards and approaches to that public.
* It must be remembered of course that good will, the basis of lasting adjustment, can be preserved in the long run, only by those whose actions warrant it...The public relations counsel has the professional responsibility to push only those ideas that he can respect, and not to promote causes or accept assignments for clients he considers anti-social.
* As in physical engineering, a feasibility study must be done and a budget drawn up.
* The engineer of consent must be powerfully equipped with facts, with truths, with evidence before he shows himself before a public.
* Bernays recommends ''[[World Almanac]]'' with lists of thousands of [[voluntary association|associations]] across the United States – a cross-section of the country.
* The public’s attitudes, ideas, presumptions or prejudices result from definite influences. One must try to find out what they are in any situation in which one is working.
* Democratic society is actually only a loose aggregate of constituent groups...To influence the public, the engineer of consent works with and through group leaders and opinion moulders on every level.
* [[Research]] furnishes the equivalent of the mariner's chart, the architect's blue print,the traveler's road map.
* Themes must appeal to the motives of the public. [[Motivation|Motives]] are the activation of both conscious and subconscious pressure created by the force of desires
* Organization also correlates the activities of any specialists who may be called upon from time to time, such as opinion researchers, fund raisers, publicity men, radio and motion picture experts, specialists for women's clubs or foreign language groups, and the like.
* Set in motion a broad activity, the success of which depends on interlocking all phases and elements of the proposed strategy, implemented by tactics that are timed to the moment of maximum effectiveness.
* The developing of events and circumstances that are not routine is one of the basic functions of the engineer of consent.

==Book==
In 1955 [[University of Oklahoma Press]] published Bernays' book ''The Engineering of Consent''.  In fact Bernays contributed only the first chapter (22 pages) "The Theory and Practice of Public Relations: A Resumé". The seven other chapters were by his associates: "Objectives" by Howard Walden Cutler, "Research" by Sherwood Dodge, "Strategy" by [[Nicholas Samstag]], "Themes and Symbols" by [[Doris Fleischman]] and H.W. Cutler, "Organization for public relations" by John Price Jones, "Planning" by [[Benjamin Fine]], and "The tactics of public relations" by A. Robert Ginsburgh.

The longest chapter, the one on strategy, begins with sociological and psychological observations on human motivation drawn from [[Karl Menninger]] and [[Vilfredo Pareto]]. Samstag illustrates varieties of strategy with sample cases before the public. He details aspects of timing, forbearance, approach, surprise, participation, association, disassociation, crossroads, personalization, bland withdrawal, apparent withdrawal, apparent runner-up, omission, reversal, mosaic, and understatement.

===Reviews===
A. Edgar Schuler&lt;ref&gt;A. Edgar Schuler (1956) [http://chla.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=chla;cc=chla;rgn=full%20text;idno=5075626_4307_001;didno=5075626_4307_001;view=image;seq=0084;node=5075626_4307_001%3A5.13 Review: The Engineering of Consent], Rural Sociology 21(1):80, link from [[Cornell University]] Core Historical Literature of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt; called the book a "convenient and compact introduction to the field of public relations." He singles out Samstag’s chapter as "interesting, enlightening, provocative, and poignant."

M. Weisglas reviewed the book for [[International Communication Gazette]],&lt;ref&gt;M. Weisglas (1956) "Review: Engineering of Consent", [[International Communication Gazette]] 2:59&lt;/ref&gt; panning it saying "Bernay’s and company have deluded their readers with false hopes about public relations- truths."

==Women’s smoking==
{{See also|Tobacco advertising}}
In a practical example of Edward Bernays’ theory detailed in his essay, [[George Washington Hill]], president of the [[American Tobacco Company]], hired Edward Bernays in 1928 to lead a campaign to entice more women to smoke in public.&lt;ref name="1929 Torches of Freedom"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign is believed to have helped converting attitudes towards women's smoking from a social [[taboo]] to a more socially acceptable act.&lt;ref name="1929 Torches of Freedom" /&gt; Bernays did this by associating women’s smoking with the ideas of "power" and "freedom" which he did by using the slogan [[Torches of Freedom]] during a famous parade in [[New York City]].

The idea of “Engineering of Consent” was motivated by [[Freud]]’s idea that humans are irrational beings, and are motivated primarily by inner desires hidden in their [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]. If one understood what those unconscious desires were, then one could use this to one’s advantage to sell products and increase sales.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn T. Tanoue (2000) "Cigarette Smoking and Women's Respiratory Health", ''Clinics in Chest Medicine'' 21(1): 47–65 {{doi| 10.1016/S0272-5231(05)70007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The Engineering of Consent also applies to the pioneered application of Freudian psychoanalytic concepts and techniques to business—in particular to the study of consumer behavior in the marketplace. Ideas established strongly influenced the practices of the advertising industry in the twentieth century.

The techniques applied developing the "consumer lifestyle" were also later applied to developing theories in [[cultural commodification]]; which has proven successful in the later 20th century (with diffusion of cultures throughout North America) to sell ethnic foods and style in popular mainstream culture by removing them from geography and ethnic histories and sanitizing them for a general public.

[[Ernest Dichter]] applied what he dubbed "the strategy of desire" for building a "stable society," by creating for the public a common identity through the products they consumed; again, much like with cultural commodification, where culture has no "identity," "meaning," or "history" inherited from previous generations, but rather, is created by the attitudes which are introduced by consumer behaviors and social patterns of the period. According to Dichter, "To understand a stable citizen, you have to know that modern man quite often tries to work off his frustrations by spending on self-sought gratification. Modern man is internally ready to fulfill his self-image, by purchasing products which compliment it."

'''TuneSat''' is an online audio recognition service launched in 2009 which enables music copyright holders to detect where their work is being used. Rights owners upload their audio files, and TuneSat begins to search and track results of matches.

Founders Chris Woods and [[Scott Schreer]] began by pitching their services to US television networks as an alternative to the cue sheet tracking which has been standard for many years from [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruno |first=Antony |title=Name that Tune – Music Recognition Technology Could Improve Accounting of Broadcast Royalties |url=https://tunesat.com/tunesatportal/static/pdf/Billboard_Name_that_Tunesat_Article.pdf |publisher=Billboard |accessdate=2 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151132/https://tunesat.com/tunesatportal/static/pdf/Billboard_Name_that_Tunesat_Article.pdf |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, TuneSat launched a product to detect unlicensed streaming across the web, in podcasts, movie trailers, fan videos, and flash websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymundo|first=Oscar|title=TuneSat Launches Audio Technology to Detect Unlicensed Streaming  |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/blogs/gear-up/tunesat-launches-audio-technology-to-detect-unlicensed-streaming-20120126|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the spring of 2013, TuneSat raised $1.223 million in equity funding to expand their tracking to more television networks around the world. At the time, TuneSat tracked 320 television networks in 14 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peoples|first=Glenn|title=TuneSat Raises $1.225 Million in Funding|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1556640/tunesat-raises-1225-million-in-funding|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs''' ('''UNOOSA''') is a part of the [[United Nations Secretariat]], located at the [[United Nations Office in Vienna|United Nations Office]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. It is tasked with implementing the decisions of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and of the [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

== History ==
{{stack|{{expand section|history milestones since 1990s founding should be detailed|date=October 2016}}}}
On {{start date and age|1958|12|13|df=y|paren=y}}, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) was initially created as a small expert unit within the United Nations Secretariat in New York to assist the ''ad hoc'' Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space established by the General Assembly in its resolution 1348 (XIII).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol%3DA%2FRES%2F1348%28XIII%29 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703011343/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F1348%28XIII%29 |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the unit became positioned within the Department of Political and Security Council Affairs (DPSCA), when the [[UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]] met for the first time.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In 1968, the unit was transformed into the Outer Space Affairs Division of DPSCA.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In 1992, the Division was transformed into the Office for Outer Space Affairs within the [[United Nations Department of Political Affairs|Department for Political Affairs]], relocating to the United Nations Office at Vienna the following year, in 1993.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In 2005, the International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (ICG) was established under the umbrella of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="icgnss"/&gt;

In 2006, the [[UN-SPIDER]] programme was established to "provide universal access to all countries and all relevant international and regional organizations to all types of space-based information and services relevant to disaster management to support the full disaster management cycle".&lt;ref name="un-spider.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spiderresolution"&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/61/110&amp;Lang=E General Assembly resolution 61/110]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703011252/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F61%2F110&amp;Lang=E |date=2015-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Takao Doi]] became Chief of Space Applications.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In 2010, the Human Space Initiative was launched.&lt;ref name="hsi2010"/&gt;

In March 2014, the Secretary-General appointed [[Simonetta Di Pippo]] ([[Italy]]) as the new Director of the Office, having previously served as the Director of Human Spaceflight at the [[European Space Agency]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In September 2016, UNOOSA announced the first-ever United Nations space mission, partnering with the [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]] (SNC). Using the SNC [[Dream Chaser]] spaceplane, UNOOSA will enable developing nations to send [[microgravity]] payloads into low-Earth orbit, with a target launch in 2021.&lt;ref name="CSM_Williams"&gt;

== Mandate ==
The Office implements the decisions of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and of the [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. The office has the dual objective of supporting the intergovernmental discussions in the Committee and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/COPUOS/stsc/index.html|title=STSC 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Legal Subcommittee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/COPUOS/Legal/index.html|title=LSC 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of assisting developing countries in using space technology for development.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The mandate has been adjusted a number of times to allow the Office to undertake, among other tasks, the coordination of the inter-agency cooperation within the United Nations on the use of space technology - UN-Space&lt;ref name="unvienna.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncosa.unvienna.org/|title=United Nations Coordination of Outer Space Activities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (resolution 3234 (XXIX)),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol%3DA%2FRES%2F3234%28XXIX%29 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703011209/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F3234%28XXIX%29 |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; implementing the United Nations Programme on Space Applications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/sapidx.html|title=UN Programme on Space Applications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (resolution 2601A (XXIV))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol%3DA%2FRES%2F2601%28XXIV%29 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703011000/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F2601%28XXIV%29 |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UN-SPIDER&lt;ref name="un-spider.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-spider.org/|title=UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programme for disaster risk management and emergency response (resolution 61/110).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol%3DA%2FRES%2F61%2F110%26Lang%3DE |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703011252/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F61%2F110&amp;Lang=E |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office also coordinates and cooperates with space agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations involved in space-related activities and, on behalf of the United Nations Secretary-General, the Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space. The office also helps poor nations suffering from climate change related problems by helping them access satellite images for free.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

== Structure ==
The Office is composed of the Committee, Policy, and Legal Affairs (CPLA) section, headed by Niklas Hedman, and the Space Applications Section (SAS), headed by Luc St- Pierre. These are coordinated by the Office of the Director managed by [[Simonetta Di Pippo]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The Committee, Policy, and Legal Affairs Section provides substantive secretariat services to the [[UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]], its Subcommittees, and working groups, as well as contributing to the implementation of the recommendations of UN global conferences. The section further convenes and services the Inter Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities – UN-Space,&lt;ref name="unvienna.org"/&gt; which is the central inter-agency coordination mechanisms in the UN system on overarching space matters, and which meets annually to discuss current and future activities, emergent technologies of interest, and other related matters, in particular in relation to the global development agenda.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Furthermore, the section is concerned with the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework governing space activities, and the office is actively fostering capacity-building in the area of space law and policy. In order to keep track of all objects in earth orbit, the office manages a searchable online register of objects launched into outer space, mandated under the Registration Convention.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The Space Applications Section works on building capacities in the practical application of space technology  and space-derived information for development. The Programme concentrates its efforts on ensuring the equal access of all countries to new space-based technologies, especially developing nations. To facilitate the capacity building with focus on developing countries, the office provides three initiatives:{{fact|date=May 2018}}

* The Human Space Initiative focuses on the public outreach to promote increased awareness among Member States to the benefits of space technology and its applications.&lt;ref name="hsi2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/en/SAP/hsti/index.html|title=Human Space Technology Initiative (HSTI)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Basic Space Technology Initiative enhances access to space application tools for sustainable development through building capacity in basic space technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/en/SAP/bsti/index.html|title=BSTI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Basic Space Science Initiative supports the growth of small research groups in universities and research institutions in the developing countries in the fields of astronomy and space science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/en/SAP/bss/index.html|title=BSSI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Programme also focuses efforts on the potential of space-based information for disaster management and emergency response. The UN-SPIDER programme (established 2006) helps to achieve this objective by being a gateway to space information for disaster management support, serving as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities and being a facilitator of capacity-building and institutional strengthening, in particular for developing countries.&lt;ref name="un-spider.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spiderresolution"/&gt;

The International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (ICG) promotes voluntary cooperation on matters of mutual interest related to civil satellite-based positioning, navigation, timing, and value-added services. To support the work of ICG, the Office was designated as the Executive Secretariat of ICG. In that capacity, UNOOSA is organizing regional workshops, training courses, and international meetings focusing on capacity-building in the use of GNSS-related technologies in various rapidly growing fields of science and industry.&lt;ref name="icgnss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/SAP/gnss/icg.html|title=International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (ICG)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Staff ==
Citizens of more than 50 countries have served as staff members, consultants, and interns.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Staff members of the Office have a wide range of educational backgrounds, including [[space science]] (including interdisciplinary fields), [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[computer science]], [[political science]], [[International relations|international affairs]], and [[law]] (including [[public international law]] and [[space law]]).{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Before [[Simonetta Di Pippo]] became Director of the Office (2014), she was Director of Human Spaceflight at the [[European Space Agency]]. Mr. Niklas Hedman serves as Chief of the Committee, Policy and Legal Affairs Section Mr Luc St-Pierre as Chief of the Space Applications Section.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

At different times, a number of other distinguished people, including [[Adigun Ade Abiodun]], [[Vladimír Kopal]], [[Mazlan Othman|Mazlan Binti Othman]], [[Luboš Perek]], [[Nandasiri Jasentuliyana]], and [[Takao Doi]] served at various positions.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

'''''Whitehouse v Lemon''''' is a 1977 court case involving the [[blasphemy law in the United Kingdom]].
== Facts ==
[[James Kirkup]]'s poem ''[[The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name|The Love that Dares to Speak its Name]]'' was published in the 3 June 1976 issue of ''[[Gay News]]''. The poem, written from the viewpoint of a Roman centurion, graphically describes him having sex with [[Jesus]] after his crucifixion, and also claims that Jesus had had sex with numerous disciples, guards, and even [[Pontius Pilate]].

In early November 1976, [[Mary Whitehouse]] obtained a copy of the poem and announced her intention to bring a [[private prosecution]] against the magazine. Leave to bring this prosecution was granted on 9 December 1976. The charges named Gay News Ltd and Denis Lemon as the publishers. A charge against Moore Harness Ltd for distributing was subsequently dropped.  The indictment described the offending publication as "a [[blasphemous libel]] concerning the [[Christian]] religion, namely an obscene poem and illustration vilifying [[Christ]] in his life and in his crucifixion".

The Gay News Fighting Fund was set up in December 1976. Judge [[Alan King-Hamilton]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] heard the trial at the [[Old Bailey]] on 4 July 1977, with [[John Mortimer|John Mortimer QC]] and [[Geoffrey Robertson|Geoffrey Robertson QC]] representing the accused and &lt;!-- Not a QC until 1979. --&gt;[[John Smyth (barrister)|John Smyth]] representing Mary Whitehouse. On Monday 11 July, the jury found both defendants guilty. Gay News Ltd was fined £1,000. Denis Lemon was fined £500 and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment suspended. It had been "touch and go", said the judge, whether he would actually send Denis Lemon to jail.

Mary Whitehouse's costs of £7,763 were ordered to be paid four-fifths by Gay News Ltd and one-fifth by Lemon. Gay News Ltd and Denis Lemon appealed against conviction and sentence. On 17 March 1978, the Court of Appeal quashed Denis Lemon's suspended prison sentence but upheld the convictions on the basis that the law of blasphemy had been developed before ''[[mens rea]]'', literally, a "guilty mind", became an essential element of a crime. ''Gay News'' readers voted by a majority of 20 to 1 in favour of appealing to the [[House of Lords]]. The [[Law Lord]]s heard the appeal against conviction and delivered their judgement on 21 February 1979.

At issue was whether or not the offence of blasphemous libel required specific intent of committing such a blasphemy. By a majority of 3 to 2, the Lords concluded that intention was not required. [[Lord Scarman]] was of the opinion that blasphemy laws should cover all religions and not just Christianity and sought [[strict liability]] for those who "cause grave offence to the religious feelings of some of their fellow citizens or are such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to read them".&lt;ref&gt;R v Lemon [1979] AC 617, 664&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was lost.

==Judgement==
The [[European Commission of Human Rights]] declared the case inadmissible to be heard by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on 7 May 1982. The £26,435 raised by the Gay News Fighting Fund through benefits and donations from the gay community and others, including a £500 donation from [[Monty Python]], was sufficient to cover the costs of the trial and appeals.

==Abolition of blasphemous libel as an offence==
Blasphemous libel ceased to be a common law offence in England and Wales with the passing of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]].

'''Yarankash''' (or '''Yaranqash''') (died 1146) was a [[Franks|Frankish]] [[slavery|slave]] who assassinated his owner [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], the [[atabeg]] of the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]]n city of [[Aleppo]]. According to [[Damascus|Damascene]] chronicler [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]]:

:"... one of [Zengi's] attendants, for whom he had a special affection and in whose company he delighted... who nursed a secret grudge against him on account of some injury previously done to him by the Atabeg, had, on finding an opportunity when he was off his guard in his drunkenness, and with the connivance and assistance of certain of his comrades amongst the attendants, assassinated him in his sleep on the eve of Sunday, 6th [[Second Rabi']] (night of Saturday, 14 September)."

Yaranqash stabbed the atabeg numerous times and then fled to the fortress of [[Qal'at Ja'bar|Dawsar]], and then from there to [[Damascus]], "in the confident belief that he would be secure there, openly putting forward his action as a claim to consideration, and imagining that he would be made welcome." The governor, [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], instead had him arrested and sent him to Zengi's son [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]] in [[Aleppo]]. Nur ad-Din sent him along to his brother [[Saif ad-Din Ghazi I]] in [[Mosul]], who had him executed.
