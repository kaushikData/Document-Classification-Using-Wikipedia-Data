'''Andorra – United States relations''' are [[bilateral relations]] between [[Andorra]] and the [[United States]].

== History ==
[[File:Xavier Espot Miro with Obamas.jpg|thumb|right|Andorran Minister of External Affairs Xavier Espot Miro with President [[Barack Obama]]; 2009.]]
Andorra and the United States enjoy friendly relations. Diplomatic relations between both nations were established on 21 February 1995 after Andorra adopted a [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] establishing itself as a sovereign parliamentary democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mae.ad/en/bilateral-and-consular-affairs/bilateral-affairs Andorran Ministry of Foreign Affairs: United States]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Relations&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm State Department: U.S. Relations With Andorra]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, Andorra has participated in the U.S. [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Exchange Program]] and works together with the United States on sharing of confiscated proceeds and instrumentalities of crimes.&lt;ref name=Relations /&gt;

There are no significant trade or investments between the two nations. Andorra participates in the American [[Visa Waiver Program]]. The United States ambassador to [[Spain]] is accredited to Andorra, however, the American consul-general in [[Barcelona]] carries out the day-to-day relations with Andorra. Andorra is accredited to the United States from its Permanent Mission to the United Nations based in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Relations /&gt;

'''"Bonne nuit ma chérie"''' ("Good Night My Darling") was the [[Germany|German]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960]], performed in [[German language|German]] (with the exception of the [[French Language|French]] of the title) by [[Wyn Hoop]].

The song was performed eleventh on the night, following the [[Netherlands]]' [[Rudi Carrell]] with "[[Wat een geluk]]" and preceding [[Italy]]'s [[Renato Rascel]] with "[[Romantica (song)|Romantica]]". At the close of voting, it had received 11 points, placing 4th in a field of 13.

The song is effectively a lullaby, with Hoop promising his lover that "my love will accompany you everywhere" and that "I'll never forget you" as she goes to sleep.

It was succeeded as [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|German representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961|1961 Contest]] by [[Lale Andersen]] with "[[Einmal sehen wir uns wieder]]".

Everything from hemp building materials and plastics to [[medical Cannabis]] and worldwide legislation is covered.

The basement of the building hosts an organic flowering Cannabis garden, cultivated by an expert grower and utilizing some of the most reliable strains and popular organic nutrients.

There is also a Cannabis College in [[Garberville, California]].&lt;ref name="Vishva Samani"&gt;{{cite news

The '''Catholic Church in [[Equatorial Guinea]]''' is part of the worldwide [[Catholic Church]], under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]].

Equatorial Guinea has one of the highest proportions of Catholics in Africa, a legacy of its status as a former Spanish colony. There are five [[diocese]]s, including one [[archdiocese]].

In 2005, about 422,000 (87%) of the 485,000 inhabitants of Equatorial Guinea were member of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthhealing.info/catholicstats.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Equatorial Guinea consists of a single ecclesiastical province, Malabo, with four suffragan dioceses in Bata, Ebebiyin, Evinayong and Mongomo. The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malabo|Archdiocese of Malabo]] has the Archbishop of Malabo as metropolitan archbishop and spiritual leader of the catholic faithful of Equatorial Guinea. The current Archbishop of Malabo is Mgr Nsue Edjang Mayé, former bishop of Ebebiyin. The [[emeritus]] archbishop is Mgr [[Ildefonso Obama Obono]].

The bishops are members of the [[Episcopal Conference of Equatorial Guinea]] (Conferencia Episcopal de Guinea Ecuatorial). President of the Episcopal Conference is Mgr Ildefonso Obama Obono, archbishop of Malabo. Furthermore, the Episcopal Conference is a member of the Association des Conferences Episcopales de l'Afrique Centrale and the Symposium des Conférences Épiscopales d'Afrique et de Madagascar.

On April 1, 2017, the Holy See erected two new dioceses in Equatorial Guinea. The Diocese of Evinayong was erected from territories formerly belonging to the Diocese of Bata and the Diocese of Mongomo was carved out of the current Diocese of Ebebiyin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2017/04/01/170401c.pdf/ Erection of the dioceses of Evinayong and Mongomo, Equatorial Guinea, and appointment of the first bishops] (Accessed 1 April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apostolic Nuncio to Equatorial Guinea since January 25, 2010 is Archbishop [[Piero Pioppo]], Titular Archbishop of Torcello.

==Parts==
The novel is organized into three parts:&lt;ref name="rtc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtc.cv/index.php?paginas=21&amp;id_cod=8274|title=Baltasar Lopes da Silva - April 23, 1907 - May 28, 1989|access-date=November 8, 2016|website=RTC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1. "Childhood" (Infância), in which the [[protagonist]] Chiquinho lives with his family and community in the village of [[Caleijão]] on the island of São Nicolau and learns his first letters.&lt;ref name="anacao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anacao.cv/2014/10/29/chiquinho-e-baltasar-marcos-da-literatura-de-cabo-verde/|title=Chiquinho and Baltasar: Mark of Cape Verde's literature|access-date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units''' is an informal network of 159 [[financial intelligence]] units (FIUs). National FIUs collect information on suspicious or unusual financial activity from the financial industry and other entities or professions required to report transactions suspected of being [[money laundering]] or [[terrorism financing]]. FIUs are normally not law enforcement agencies, with their mission being to process and analyze the information received. If sufficient evidence of unlawful activity is found, the matter is passed to the public prosecution agencies.

The Egmont Group defines an FIU as a central, national agency responsible for receiving (and, as permitted, requesting), analyzing and disseminating to the competent authorities, disclosures of financial information:

* concerning suspected proceeds of crime and potential financing of terrorism, or
* required by national legislation or regulation, in order to counter money laundering and terrorism financing.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== History ==
The Egmont Group was formed in 1995, taking its name from the Egmont Arenberg Palace in [[Brussels]], where the meeting took place.

In early 2008, with the support of [[Jim Flaherty]], [[Finance Minister]] of Canada, and the [[Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada]] (FINTRAC), the Canadian FIU, the Egmont Group established its [[Secretariat (administrative office)|Secretariat]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin.gc.ca/n08/08-014-eng.asp |title=Archived - Minister of Finance Opens Egmont Secretariat Headquarters in Toronto |publisher=Fin.gc.ca |date=2008-09-19 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The goal of the Egmont Group is to provide a forum for FIUs around the world to improve cooperation in the fight against money laundering and financing of terrorism and to foster the implementation of domestic programs in this field. The Egmont Group provides support to member FIUs by:
* expanding and systematizing international cooperation in the reciprocal exchange of information,
* increasing the effectiveness of FIUs by offering training and promoting personnel exchanges to improve the expertise and capabilities of personnel employed by FIUs,
* fostering better and secure communication among FIUs through the application of technology, such as the Egmont Secure Web (ESW),
* fostering increased coordination and support among the operational divisions of member FIUs,
* promoting the operational autonomy of FIUs, and
* promoting the establishment of FIUs in conjunction with jurisdictions with an AML/CFT program in place, or in areas with a program in the early stages of development.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

{{EU history |expanded=Organisation}}
The '''European Economic Community''' ('''EEC''') was a [[regional organisation]] which aimed to bring about [[economic integration]] among its member states. It was created by the [[Treaty of Rome]] of 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Today the largely rewritten treaty continues in force as the ''Treaty on the functioning of the European Union'', as renamed by the Lisbon Treaty.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the formation of the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993, the EEC was incorporated and renamed as the '''European Community''' ('''EC'''). In 2009 the EC's institutions were absorbed into the EU's wider framework and the community ceased to exist.

The Community's initial aim was to bring about economic integration, including a [[common market]] and [[customs union]], among its [[Inner Six|six founding members]]: [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[West Germany]]. It gained a common set of [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]] along with the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EURATOM) as one of the [[European Communities]] under the 1965 [[Merger Treaty]] (Treaty of Brussels). In 1993, a complete [[single market]] was achieved, known as the [[internal market]], which allowed for the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within the EEC. In 1994, the internal market was formalised by the EEA agreement. This agreement also extended the internal market to include most of the member states of the [[European Free Trade Association]], forming the [[European Economic Area]] covering 15 countries.

Upon the entry into force of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in 1993, the EEC was renamed the ''European Community'' to reflect that it covered a wider range than economic policy. This was also when the three European Communities, including the EC, were collectively made to constitute the first of the [[three pillars of the European Union]], which the treaty also founded. The EC existed in this form until it was abolished by the 2009 [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which incorporated the EC's institutions into the EU's wider framework and provided that the EU would "replace and succeed the European Community".

The EEC was also known as the '''Common Market''' in the English-speaking countries and sometimes referred to as the '''European Community''' even before it was officially renamed as such in 1993.

==History==
{{Further|History of the European Union}}

===Background===
In 1951, the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed, creating the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). This was an international community based on [[supranationalism]] and international law, designed to help the [[Economy of the European Union|economy of Europe]] and prevent future war by [[European integration|integrating]] its [[Member state of the European Union|members]].

In the aim of creating a [[federal Europe]] two further communities were proposed: a [[European Defence Community]] and a [[European Political Community]]. While the treaty for the latter was being drawn up by the [[European Parliament|Common Assembly]], the ECSC parliamentary chamber, the proposed defense community was rejected by the [[French Parliament]]. ECSC President [[Jean Monnet]], a leading figure behind the communities, resigned from the High Authority in protest and began work on alternative communities, based on economic integration rather than political integration.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond F. Mikesell, ''The Lessons of Benelux and the European Coal and Steel Community for the European Economic Community'', The American Economic Review, Vol. 48, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the Seventieth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association (May 1958), pp. 428–441&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Messina Conference]] in 1955, [[Paul Henri Spaak]] was given the task to prepare a report on the idea of a [[customs union]]. The so-called [[Spaak Report]] of the [[Spaak Committee]] formed the cornerstone of the intergovernmental negotiations at Val Duchesse conference centre in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aei.pitt.edu/995/|title=Spaak report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[Ohlin Report]] the Spaak Report would provide the basis for the [[Treaty of Rome]].

In 1956, [[Paul Henri Spaak]] led the [[Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom]] at the [[Castle of the Valley of the Duchess|Val Duchesse]] conference centre, which prepared for the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957. The conference led to the signature, on 25 March 1957, of the [[Treaty of Rome]] establishing a European Economic Community.

===Creation and early years===
The resulting communities were the European Economic Community (EEC) and the [[Euratom|European Atomic Energy Community]] (EURATOM or sometimes EAEC). These were markedly less supranational than the previous communities,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} due to protests from some countries that their [[sovereignty]] was being infringed (however there would still be concerns with the behaviour of the [[Hallstein Commission]]). The first formal meeting of the [[Hallstein Commission]] was held on 16 January 1958 at the [[Castle of the Valley of the Duchess|Chateau de Val-Duchesse]]. The EEC (direct ancestor of the modern Community) was to create a [[customs union]] while Euratom would promote co-operation in the [[nuclear power]] sphere. The EEC rapidly became the most important of these and expanded its activities. One of the first important accomplishments of the EEC was the establishment (1962) of common price levels for agricultural products. In 1968, internal tariffs (tariffs on trade between member nations) were removed on certain products.

[[File:De Gaulle-OWI.jpg|thumb|[[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] vetoed British membership, held back the development of Parliament's powers and was at the centre of the 'empty chair crisis' of 1965]]
Another crisis was triggered in regard to proposals for the financing of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which came into force in 1962. The transitional period whereby decisions were made by unanimity had come to an end, and majority-voting in the Council had taken effect. Then-[[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s opposition to supranationalism and fear of the other members challenging the CAP led to an "empty chair policy" whereby French representatives were withdrawn from the European institutions until the French veto was reinstated. Eventually, a compromise was reached with the [[Luxembourg compromise]] on 29 January 1966 whereby a [[gentlemen's agreement]] permitted members to use a veto on areas of national interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6453889.stm Fifty years of fraternal rivalry] news.bbc.co.uk 19/03/07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_empty_chair_policy-en-f6d19361-9a7a-4e39-ae93-0f898e652d85.html|title=The 'empty chair' policy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 1967 when the [[Merger Treaty]] came into operation, combining the institutions of the ECSC and Euratom into that of the EEC, they already shared a [[European Parliament|Parliamentary Assembly]] and [[European Court of Justice|Courts]]. Collectively they were known as the ''[[European Communities]]''. The Communities still had independent personalities although were increasingly integrated. Future treaties granted the community new powers beyond simple economic matters which had achieved a high level of integration. As it got closer to the goal of political integration and a peaceful and united Europe, what [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] described as a ''[[Common European Home]]''.

===Enlargement and elections===
The 1960s saw the first attempts at [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]. In 1961, [[Denmark]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Norway]] and the [[United Kingdom]] applied to join the three Communities. However, President Charles de Gaulle saw British membership as a [[Trojan horse]] for U.S. influence and vetoed membership, and the applications of all four countries were suspended. {{Citation needed|date = May 2016}} [[Greece]] became the first country to join the EC in 1961 as an associate member, however its membership was suspended in 1967 after the Colonels coup d'état.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deschamps|first1=Etienne|last2=Lekl|first2=Christian|title=The accession of Greece|url=https://www.cvce.eu/content/publication/1999/1/1/61a2a7a5-39a9-4b06-91f8-69ae77b41515/publishable_en.pdf|website=CVCE|publisher=University of Luxemburg|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, in February 1962, [[Spain]] attempted to join the European Communities. However, because [[Francoist Spain]] was not a democracy, all members rejected the request in 1964.

The four countries resubmitted their applications on 11 May 1967 and with [[Georges Pompidou]] succeeding Charles de Gaulle as French president in 1969, the veto was lifted. Negotiations began in 1970 under the pro-European government of [[Edward Heath]], who had to deal with disagreements relating to the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] and the UK's relationship with the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Nevertheless, two years later the accession treaties were signed so that Denmark, Ireland and the UK [[Enlargement of the European Union#First enlargement|joined the Community]] effective 1 January 1973. The Norwegian people had finally [[Norway and the European Union|rejected membership]] in a [[Norwegian European Communities membership referendum, 1972|referendum on 25 September 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/28/newsid_4208000/4208314.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaties of Rome]] had stated that the [[European Parliament]] must be directly elected, however this required the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] to agree on a common voting system first. The Council procrastinated on the issue and the Parliament remained appointed,&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine |author2=Michael Newman | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization) | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7190-5666-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; French President Charles de Gaulle was particularly active in blocking the development of the Parliament, with it only being granted [[Budgetary treaties of the European Communities|Budgetary powers]] following his resignation.{{Citation needed|date = May 2016}}

Parliament pressured for agreement and on 20 September 1976 the Council agreed part of the necessary instruments for election, deferring details on electoral systems which remain varied to this day.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; During the tenure of [[Roy Jenkins|President Jenkins]], in June 1979, the elections were held in all the then-members (see [[European Parliament election, 1979]]).&lt;ref name="Veil election"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/background_page/008-1806-015-01-03-901-20070109BKG01804-15-01-2007-2007-false/default_p001c006_en.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219023023/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/background_page/008-1806-015-01-03-901-20070109BKG01804-15-01-2007-2007-false/default_p001c006_en.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-02-19|title=European Parliament press releases|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Parliament, galvanised by direct election and new powers, started working full-time and became more active than the previous assemblies.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt;

Shortly after its election, the Parliament  proposed that the Community adopt the [[flag of Europe]] design used by the [[Council of Europe]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The European Council in 1984 appointed an ''ad hoc'' committee for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/resources/historicaldocument.faces/en/4659/html.bookmark Regarding The "Adonnino Report" - Report to the European Council by the ad hoc committee "On a People's Europe", A 10.04 COM 85, SN/2536/3/85]. 
Under the header of "strengthening of the Community's image and identity", the Committee
suggested the introduction of "a flag and an emblem", recommending a design based on the Council of Europe flag, but with the addition of "a gold letter E" in the center of the circle of stars:
"bearing in mind the independence and the different nature of the two organizations, the Committee proposes to the European Concil that the European Community emblem and flag should be a blue rectangle with, in the center, a circle of twelve five-pointed gold stars which do not touch, surrounding a gold letter E, of the design already used by the Commission." Adonnino Report, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Council in 1985 largely followed the Committee's recommendations, but as the adoption of a flag was strongly reminiscent of a [[national flag]] representing [[statehood]],  was  controversial, the "flag of Europe" design was adopted only with the status of a "logo" or "emblem".&lt;ref name="emblem"&gt;Tobias Theiler, ''Political Symbolism and European Integration'', Manchester University Press, 2005 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JMiqfaCXr50C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA61 p. 61&amp;ndash;65].  The compromise was widely disregarded from the beginning, and the "European logo" in spite of the explicit avoidance of giving it the status of a "flag" was referred to as "Community flag" or even "European flag" from the outset. Tobias Theiler, ''Political Symbolism and European Integration'', Manchester University Press, 2005 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JMiqfaCXr50C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Council, or European summit, had developed since the 1960s as an informal meeting of the Council at the level of heads of state. It had originated from then-[[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (e.g. the Commission) over the integration process. It was mentioned in the treaties for the first time in the [[Single European Act]] (see below).&lt;ref name="Dragoman"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Stark |first=Christine |authorlink= |title=Evolution of the European Council: The implications of a permanent seat |work= |publisher=Dragoman.org |url=http://www.dragoman.org/ec/belfast-2002.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=2007-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709220601/http://www.dragoman.org/ec/belfast-2002.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the prospect of further enlargement, and a desire to increase areas of co-operation, the [[Single European Act]] was signed by the foreign ministers on the 17 and 28 February 1986 in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] and the [[Hague]] respectively. In a single document it dealt with reform of institutions, extension of powers, foreign policy cooperation and the single market. It came into force on 1 July 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_provisions_of_the_single_european_act-en-243555aa-d219-4525-9978-34325bb5e17a.html|title=The provisions of the Single European Act|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was followed by work on what would be the [[Maastricht Treaty]], which was agreed on 10 December 1991, signed the following year and coming into force on 1 November 1993 establishing the European Union, and paving the way for the [[European Monetary Union]].

===European Community===

The EU absorbed the European Communities as one of its [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]]. The EEC's areas of activities were enlarged and were renamed the ''European Community'', continuing to follow the [[supranational]] structure of the EEC. The EEC institutions became those of the EU, however the Court, Parliament and Commission had only limited input in the new pillars, as they worked on a more [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] system than the European Communities. This was reflected in the names of the institutions, the Council was formally the "Council of the ''European Union''" while the Commission was formally the "Commission of the ''European Communities''".

However, after the Treaty of Maastricht, Parliament gained a much bigger role. Maastricht brought in the [[codecision procedure]], which gave it equal legislative power with the Council on Community matters. Hence, with the greater powers of the supranational institutions and the operation of [[Qualified Majority Voting]] in the Council, the Community pillar could be described as a far more [[Federalism|federal]] method of decision making.

The [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] transferred responsibility for free movement of persons (e.g., [[Visa (document)|visas]], [[illegal immigration]], [[Right of asylum|asylum]]) from the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) pillar to the European Community (JHA was renamed [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]] (PJCC) as a result).&lt;ref name="Folk"&gt;[http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/euo_en/spsv/all/12/ What are the three pillars of the EU?], Folketingets EU-Oplysning&lt;/ref&gt; Both Amsterdam and the [[Treaty of Nice]] also extended [[codecision procedure]] to nearly all policy areas, giving Parliament equal power to the Council in the Community.

In 2002, the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]] which established the ECSC expired, having reached its 50-year limit (as the first treaty, it was the only one with a limit). No attempt was made to renew its mandate; instead, the [[Treaty of Nice]] transferred certain of its elements to the [[Treaty of Rome]] and hence its work continued as part of the EC area of the European Community's remit.

After the entry into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] in 2009 the pillar structure ceased to exist. The European Community, together with its [[legal person]]ality, was absorbed into the newly consolidated European Union which merged in the other two pillars (however Euratom remained distinct). This was originally proposed under the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] but that treaty failed ratification in 2005.

==Aims and achievements==
{{Expand section|date=December 2007}}
The main aim of the EEC, as stated in its preamble, was to "preserve peace and liberty and to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe". Calling for balanced economic growth, this was to be accomplished through:&lt;ref name="ENA EEC achievements"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The achievements of the EEC|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/report_by_the_eec_commission_on_the_implementation_of_the_treaty_of_rome_january_1958_january_1962-en-a757255d-b121-4d44-842f-1aa861a5f018.html|accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The establishment of a [[customs union]] with a [[common external tariff]]
# Common policies for [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]], [[Common Transport Policy|transport]] and trade, including [[standardization]] (for example, the [[CE marking]] designates standards compliance)
# [[Enlargement of the European Union|Enlargement of the EEC]] to the rest of Europe

For the customs union, the treaty provided for a 10% reduction in custom duties and up to 20% of global import quotas. Progress on the customs union proceeded much faster than the twelve years planned. However, France faced some setbacks due to their [[Algerian War|war with Algeria]].&lt;ref name="ENA Customs"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The European Customs Union|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_european_customs_union-en-08ef3b37-2ab4-4349-aec8-819809c59a9d.html|accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six states that founded the EEC and the other two Communities were known as the "[[Inner Six|inner six]]" (the "outer seven" were those countries who formed the [[European Free Trade Association]]). The six were France, West Germany, Italy and the three [[Benelux]] countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The first enlargement was in 1973, with the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Greece, Spain and Portugal joined in the 1980s. The former [[East Germany]] became part of the EEC upon German reunification in 1990. Following the creation of the EU in 1993, it has enlarged to include an additional sixteen countries by 2013.

Member states are represented in some form in each institution. The [[Council of the European Union|Council]] is also composed of one national minister who represents their national government. Each state also has a right to one [[European Commissioner]] each, although in the [[European Commission]] they are not supposed to represent their national interest but that of the Community. Prior to 2004, the larger members (France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) have had two Commissioners. In the [[European Parliament]], members are [[Apportionment in the European Parliament|allocated a set number seats]] related to their population, however these ([[European Parliament election, 1979|since 1979]]) have been directly elected and they sit according to political allegiance, not national origin. Most other institutions, including the [[European Court of Justice]], have some form of national division of its members.

There were three political institutions which held the executive and legislative power of the EEC, plus one judicial institution and a fifth body created in 1975. These institutions (except for the auditors) were created in 1957 by the EEC but from 1967 onwards they applied to all three Communities. The Council represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions Commission"&gt;{{Cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Institutions: The European Commission |work= |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |doi= |accessdate=2007-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623104055/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |archivedate=23 June 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the Council, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Council for approval and the Parliament for an opinion (in some cases it had a veto, depending upon the [[European Union legislative procedure|legislative procedure]] in use). The Commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions Commission"/&gt; After the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, these institutions became those of the European Union, though limited in some areas due to the pillar structure. Despite this, Parliament in particular has gained more power over legislation and security of the Commission. The Court was the highest authority in the law, settling legal disputes in the Community, while the Auditors had no power but to investigate.

===Background===
[[File:Luxembourg0080.JPG|thumb|The High Authority had more executive powers than the Commission which replaced it]]
The EEC inherited some of the [[European Coal and Steel Community#Institutions|Institutions of the ECSC]] in that the [[European Parliament|Common Assembly]] and [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] of the ECSC had their authority extended to the EEC and Euratom in the same role. However the EEC, and Euratom, had different executive bodies to the ECSC. In place of the ECSC's Council of Ministers was the [[Council of the European Union|Council of the European Economic Community]], and in place of the [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority]] was the [[European Commission|Commission of the European Communities]].

There was greater difference between these than name: the French government of the day had grown suspicious of the supranational power of the High Authority and sought to curb its powers in favour of the intergovernmental style Council. Hence the Council had a greater executive role in the running of the EEC than was the situation in the ECSC. By virtue of the [[Merger Treaty]] in 1967, the executives of the ECSC and Euratom were merged with that of the EEC, creating a single institutional structure governing the three separate Communities. From here on, the term ''European Communities'' were used for the institutions (for example, from ''Commission of the European Economic Community'' to the ''Commission of the European Communities'').&lt;ref name="ENA Merger"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Merging of the executives|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/merging_the_executives-en-575850b6-f472-406a-936d-8c08a9e0db32.html|accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ENA Council"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher = CVCE|title = Council of the European Union|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_council_of_the_european_union-en-de23700c-e50a-4e0e-a7de-80665e4caf9f.html|accessdate = 2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ENA Commission"&gt;{{Cite web|title = European Commission|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_commission-en-281a3c0c-839a-48fd-b69c-bc2588c780ec.html|accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078267-0023, Bonn, Ministerpräsidenten mit EU-Kommissar Delors-CROPPED.jpg|thumb|[[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jacques Delors]] the last EEC Commission President.]]

The [[Council of the European Union|Council of the European Communities]] was a body holding legislative and executive powers and was thus the main decision making body of the Community. Its [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] rotated between the [[European Union member state|member states]] every six months and it is related to the [[European Council]], which was an informal gathering of national leaders (started in 1961) on the same basis as the Council.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions Council"&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703155822/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm|archivedate=3 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council was composed of one national [[Minister (government)|minister]] from each member state. However the Council met in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture was being discussed, the Council would be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represented their governments and were accountable to their national political systems. Votes were taken either by majority (with votes allocated according to population) or unanimity. In these various forms they share some legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions Council"/&gt; Since the 1960s the Council also began to meet informally at the level of national leaders; these [[European Council|European summits]] followed the same presidency system and secretariat as the Council but was not a formal formation of it.

===Commission===
The [[European Commission|Commission of the European Communities]] was the [[Executive (government)|executive arm]] of the community, drafting [[law of the European Union|Community law]], dealing with the day to running of the Community and upholding the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]]. It was designed to be independent, representing the Community interest, but was composed of national representatives (two from each of the larger states, one from the smaller states). One of its members was the [[President of the European Commission|President]], appointed by the Council, who chaired the body and represented it.

===Parliament===
[[File:Pleniere.JPG|thumb|The [[European Parliament]] held its first elections in 1979, slowly gaining more influence over Community decision making.]]

Under the Community, the [[European Parliament]] (formerly the European Parliamentary Assembly) had an advisory role to the Council and Commission. There were a number of [[European Union legislative procedure|Community legislative procedures]], at first there was only the [[consultation procedure]], which meant Parliament had to be consulted, although it was often ignored. The [[Single European Act]] gave Parliament more power, with the [[assent procedure]] giving it a right to veto proposals and the [[cooperation procedure]] giving it equal power with the Council if the Council was not unanimous.

In 1970 and 1975, the [[Budgetary treaties of the European Communities|Budgetary treaties]] gave Parliament power over the [[Budget of the European Union|Community budget]]. The Parliament's members, up-until 1980 were national MPs serving part-time in the Parliament. The Treaties of Rome had required elections to be held once the Council had decided on a voting system, but this did not happen and elections were delayed until 1979 (see [[European Parliament election, 1979]]). After that, Parliament was elected every five years. In the following 20 years, it gradually won co-decision powers with the Council over the adoption of legislation, the right to approve or reject the appointment of the Commission President and the Commission as a whole, and the right to approve or reject international agreements entered into by the Community.

===Court===
The [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice of the European Communities]] was the [[supreme court|highest court]] of on matters of [[Law of the European Union|Community law]] and was composed of one judge per state with a president elected from among them. Its role was to ensure that Community law was applied in the same way across all states and to settle legal disputes between institutions or states. It became a powerful institution as Community law overrides national law.

===Auditors===
The fifth institution is the ''[[European Court of Auditors]]'', which despite its name had no judicial powers like the Court of Justice. Instead, it ensured that [[taxpayer]] funds from the [[budget of the European Union|Community budget]] have been correctly spent. The court provided an [[audit report]] for each financial year to the Council and Parliament and gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions. It is the only institution not mentioned in the original treaties, having been set up in 1975.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions Auditors"&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Institutions: Court of Auditors|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222001147/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|archivedate=22 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Frankfurter Rindswurst''''' (German for “Frankfurt beef sausage”) is a [[sausage]] made of beef. It was introduced in 1894 by [[Frankfurt]] butcher Gref-Volsing to meet the demands of the growing Jewish population of the city and has since become one of its most famous delicacies. The sausage may be boiled, [[broilling|broiled]], or grilled.

'''''Girl on a Bicycle''''' is a 1977 [[novel]] by [[Leland Bardwell]] (her first).  The novel is set in 1940s [[Ireland]], and deals with the reality of being [[Protestant]] and what it means to be an individual caught up in the momentum of historical change.  It is a coming-of-age story for Julie Da Vraire as she makes her way on her own after being socially outcast.

==Reception==
[[Anthony Burgess]] (author of ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'') described the novel as "a period gem". While Senator David Norris sees the work as the "best Irish big house novel of the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertiespress.com/cartage.html?main_page=product_book_info&amp;cPath=13&amp;products_id=82 |title=''Girl on a Bicycle'' |publisher=Liberties Press |location=LibertiesPress.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713204526/http://www.libertiespress.com/cartage.html?main_page=product_book_info&amp;cPath=13&amp;products_id=82 |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jihomoravsky kraj.svg|thumb|upright|150px|South Moravian Region]]
'''Hody''' ('''the Feasts''') is an annual traditional celebration held in many villages and towns of historical land [[Moravia]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. The festivity is held from May to November in almost all villages and towns of South Eastern Moravia (in the so-called ''[[Moravian Slovakia]]''). The time of the celebration differs - each village or town has a church building dedicated to a particular patron saint and usually the nearest Sunday after the date of the saint's day is also the date for celebration of ''Hody''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Folklore Summer - Folklore Festivals and Celebrations | url=http://www.heartofeurope.cz/folklore2.html | work= | publisher=Prague - Heart of Europe | date= | accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebration usually takes place on Sunday and may last one or two more days. In the centre of the event stands a festive [[maypole]] (in [[Czech language|Czech]]: ''mája'' or ''májka'') which is usually manually erected one day before the festivity. The maypole is often more than 30 metres tall, built from two or three [[spruce]] trees. It is erected with the help of ladders and crowbars. The maypole stands in the centre of a dancing place (in Czech: ''plac'' or ''sólo''). People are dancing and singing around with the accompaniment of the brass music (in [[Czech language|Czech]]: ''dechová muzika'' or ''dechovka'').

The main organizer and arranger of ''Hody'' is a selected young boy called ''první stárek'' (the first ''stárek'' - literally the first "''old one''").&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | title=Festivity of Hody in Moravia | url=http://www.bridgebetweennations.com/news1.html | work= | publisher=Bridge Between Nations | date= | accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and a group of young friends (somewhere they are called ''stárek''s - Czech plural: ''stárci;'' or they can be called ''chasa'') are responsible for the organization and smooth running of the event. Each ''stárek (''or member of ''chasa)'' also has a girl partner, usually called ''starka'' or ''stárka''. The boys and girls wears a traditional folk costume, which differs widely from region to region.

At the beginning of ''Hody'', a mayor of the village or town should pass symbolically the rule over to the ''first stárek''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

[[File:Logo_of_International_Year_of_Pulses_2016.jpg|thumb|Logo of International Year of Pulses 2016|alt=Logo of International Year of Pulses 2016]]
'''2016''' was declared as the '''International Year of Pulses''' by the [[sixty eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly]] on December 20, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Observances: International Years|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/observances/international-years/index.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=April 29, 2015|ref=United Nations Observances: International Years}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the United Nations has been nominated to declare a year for [[Pulse_(legume)|pulses]].
{{quote|An International Year designation provides an unprecedented opportunity to raise awareness and to celebrate the role of beans, chickpeas, lentils and other pulses in feeding the world. Even more importantly, it will be a galvanizing moment to draw together key actors to further the contributions pulses make to health, nutrition, and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iyp2016.org/about-us|title=United Nations Proclaims 2016 as “International Year of Pulses”|publisher=Global Pulse Confederation|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 68th UN General Assembly declared 2016 the International Year of Pulses (IYP) (A/RES/68/231)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Purpose==
The FAO intends to make people more aware of the [[Pulse (legume)#Nutrients|nutritional value of pulses]], of their contribution to [[sustainability]], and more reliable food.  The year should facilitate cooperation within food production systems to use [[protein]] in pulses better. Also the year should promote production of pulses worldwide, improve crop rotation and improve trade in pulses.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'' [http://www.fao.org/pulses-2016/en/ 2016 International Year of Pulses]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IYP 2016 aims to heighten public awareness of the nutritional benefits of pulses as part of sustainable food production aimed towards food security and nutrition. The Year will create a unique opportunity to encourage connections throughout the food chain that would better utilize pulse-based proteins, further global production of pulses, better utilize crop rotations and address the challenges in the trade of pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclive.in/international-year-of-pulses-2016/|title=International Year of Pulses - 2016|accessdate=17 September 2016|agency=ABC Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/resources/infographics/infographics-details/en/c/429898/|title=Health Benefits of Pulses|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Diet is an important contributor to health, and to disease. Most countries face nutritional problems, from undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies to obesity and diet-related diseases (such as type II diabetes and certain types of cancer), or a mix of these. Pulses are a nutrient-rich food that as part of a healthy diet can help fight malnutrition in both developed and developing countries.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has stated that the International Pulses Year has helped raise awareness globally of the many benefits of pulses, such as beans, lentils and chickpeas, gains must be further strengthened to achieve the international community’s new development goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International Pulses Year Highlights Pulses Benefits: FAO|url=http://abclive.in/international-pulses-year-highlights-pulses-benefits-fao/|agency=ABC Live|issue=Online|publisher=ABC Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of Pulses==
Pulses are beans and peas that are harvested dry. Examples are lentils, chickpeas, pinto beans, kidney beans, and more.

#Pulses provide a vital source of plant-based proteins and amino acids for people around the globe, ensuring food security.
#As part of a healthy diet high in fiber, pulses fight obesity.
#Pulses also prevent and help manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, coronary conditions, and cancer.
#Pulses are an important source of plant-based protein for livestock.
#Pulses pull nitrogen from the air into the soil, increasing soil fertility.
#Pulses use less water than most other protein crops, making them a sustainable agricultural choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crops.org/iyp|title=Celebrate 2016: The International Year of Pulses! - Crop Science Society of America|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3521">'''Island Command Faroes''' (ISCOMFAROES) was the military unit on the [[Faroe Islands]]. It was the military command of the Faroe Islands, the Faroe Islands airspace and the Faroe Islands territorial waters. It supported the local government with military advice as well as search and rescue capabilities. Island Command Faroes was amalgamated with [[Island Command Greenland]] to a [[Arctic Command|Joint Arctic Command]] on 31 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyuinterventional.com/the-queen-opened-the-arctic-command/ The Queen opened the Arctic Command] Ritzau, October 31st, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Faroes Marine District was established on 5 September 1951 in [[Tórshavn]].

On 1 June 1961, changed the district name to the Faroe Islands Command, and the same date was Marine Station Thorshavn created as authority.

In 1963, Marine Station at Hoyvíksvegur 58 was built and became the new home of the Faroe Islands Command, which until 1979 consisted of command authority (Faroe Command), Marine Station and Naval Radio Tórshavn. From amalgamation in 1979 until the establishment of the [[Arctic Command]] on 31 October 2012, the Faroe Islands Command was the joint authority name.

On 1 January 2001, established the new Level II authority, which was called the Faroe Islands Command.

On 2 July 2002, there was a ceremony where the Dannebrog (Danish Flag) was hauled down for the last time at the Marine Station in Tórshavn. The key to the buildings was then handed over to Tórshavn mayor. The final relocation was reality and Mjørkadalur the new home of the Faroe Islands Command.

In 2005, the Danish government decided that all activities on Sornfelli should be shut down on 15 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forsvaret.dk/1ESK/Nyt%20og%20Presse/Pages/Eftermereend47%C3%A5rsvirkep%C3%A5Sornfellierdetsidsteoperativeudstyrnuslukket.aspx forsvaret.dk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220075444/http://forsvaret.dk/1ESK/Nyt%20og%20Presse/Pages/Eftermereend47%C3%A5rsvirkep%C3%A5Sornfellierdetsidsteoperativeudstyrnuslukket.aspx |date=2014-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NATO radar installations which were established in 1963 in [[Mjørkadalur]] on the mountain [[Sornfelli]] in 749 meters above sea level, were a step in the defense of the Arctic Circle. The radar installation was stopped at a small ceremony on 1 January 2007 after more than 40 years. 

It is allowed for civilians to travel on the mountain road up to the radar facility, which offers a panoramic view of the Faroes. 

Since 10 February 2011 a part of the main building in Mjørkadalur has been used as a detention by the Danish Police in the Faroe Islands, this happened due to problems with mould in the former locations of the detention. The Danish defence handed the buildings in Mjørkadalur to the Faroese government in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsverk.fo/Default.aspx?pageid=15939&amp;NewsItemID=15287 landsverk.fo - Landið yvirtekur ognirnar í Mjørkadali í næstum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps''' ({{lang-bg|Македоно-одринско опълчение}}, ''Makedono-odrinsko opalchenie'') was a [[Military volunteer|volunteer]] [[corps]] of the [[Bulgarian Army]] during the [[Balkan Wars]]. It was formed on 23 September 1912 and consisted of [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] volunteers from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]], regions still under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], and thus not subject to [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] [[military service]]. 

The Commander of the Corps was [[Major General]] Nikola Genev, Assistant Commander - [[Colonel]] [[Aleksandar Protogerov]]. [[Chief of Staff]] was [[Major]] [[Petar Darvingov]]. During the [[Second Balkan War]] Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps took part in the battles against [[Serbian Army]]. Besides Bulgarians, the corps also included volunteers from other nationalities, including a whole [[Armenia]]n 2nd [[company (military unit)|company]] led by Lieutenant [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] and [[Andranik Ozanian]] (in the 12th [[Lozengrad]] [[battalion]] or druzhina). There were many [[Armenia]]ns in the 3rd company led by Lieutenant [[Torgom]] (of the same 12th battalion of the 3rd Brigade). Another [[Armenia]]n officer - [[Hovhannes Chaush]] led a company in the 7th battalion of 3rd Brigade. 

== The Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps (23 Sep 1912 - 1 Oct 1913) ==
Total personnel numbered 14,670. [[Bulgarians]] were 14,139 (11,470 were from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], 1,215 - from [[Thrace]], and 2,512 - from [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]). Foreigners were 656 (more than 400 [[Armenians]], of which only 275 in the 2nd Armenian company, 82 [[Russians]], 68 [[Romanians]], 40 [[Serbs]], 21 [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarians]], 12 [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegrins]], 3 [[Greeks]], 1 [[Albanians|Albanian]], 1 [[English people|Englishman]], 1 [[Italians|Italian]], and a [[Persians|Persian]]).

[[Opalchenie Peak]] in [[Vinson Massif]], [[Antarctica]] is named after the Bulgarian Volunteer Force in the 1877-1878 [[Russo-Turkish War]] and the Macedonian-Adrianople Volunteer Force in the 1912-1913 [[Balkan Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=137201 Opalchenie Peak.] SCAR [[Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Malaysia–Thailand Joint Development Area''' is a 7,250&amp;nbsp;km square area in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] which was created as an interim measure to exploit the natural resources in the seabed or [[Territorial waters#Continental shelf|continental shelf]] claimed by the two countries and to share the proceeds equally. The arrangement does not extinguish the legal right to claims by both countries over the area. This is one of the first applications of the joint development a memorandum of understanding on 21 February 1979 in Chiang Mai, Thailand for the establishment of the joint development area and authority to administer the area. This was followed by an agreement to constitute the joint development authority on 30 May 1990 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

As of the end of 2007, approximately 8.5 trillion standard cubic feet of gas reserves (proved and probable) from twenty two fields in the area have been discovered. Gas production from the Cakerawala gas field began on 2 January 2005.

==The area==
The joint development area basically coincides with the area of [[Malaysia–Thailand border|overlapping claim]] of the [[Territorial waters#Continental shelf|continental shelf]] by the two countries. The western and north-eastern boundaries of the JDA is that of Malaysia's continental shelf claim as asserted in its 1979 map issued by the country's Survey and Mapping Department. The southern boundary coincides with Thailand's exclusive economic zone boundary as proclaimed in 1988.

A portion of the joint development area is also claimed by Vietnam and is known as the Tripartite Overlapping Claim Area. The three countries have agreed to utilise the joint development formula for the exploitation of resources in the area but no further developments have been reported so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

==Exploration, development and production==

===Exploration===
The joint development area was originally divided into three blocks for exploration. They are Blocks A-18 (middle portion of the JDA), B-17 (northern portion) and C-19 (southern portion). On 21 April 1994, two production sharing contracts (PSC) were awarded by the Malaysia–Thailand Joint Authority (MTJA) to two groups of contractors. Each group of contractors also formed operating companies for exploraion. They were:

:'''Block A-18:'''
:*Contractors: PC JDA Ltd (50% share in the contract), Hess Oil Company of Thailand (JDA) Ltd (49.5%) and Hess Oil Company of Thailand Inc (0.5%)
:*Operator: Carigali Hess Operating Company Sdn Bhd

:'''Blocks B-17''' and '''C-19'''
:*Contractors: PTTEP International Limited (50%), PC JDA Ltd (50%)
:*Operator: Carigali-PTTEPI Operating Company Sdn Bhd (CPOC)

PC JDA LLtd is a wholly owned subsidiary company of Petronas Carigali Sdn. Bhd. while PTTEP International Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary company of [[PTT Exploration and Production]] Public Company Limited.

The period for exploration ended on 20 April 2002 and the above contractors retained the gas fields holding areas in their respective blocks but had to relinquish the areas not deemed as gas fields holding areas back to the MTJA. The relinquished areas of the JDA (approximately 3,475&amp;nbsp;km square) was made into a new block named Block B-17-01. A PSC was signed on 30 September 2004 for the contractors for the new block. They are:

:'''Block B-17-01:'''
:*Contractors: PTTEP International Ltd (50%), PC JDA Ltd (50%)
:*Operator: Carigali-PTTEPI Operating Company Sdn Bhd (CPOC)

Between 1994 to 2007, a total of 59 exploration and appraisal wells were drilled in the JDA. Thirty-seven wells were located in Block A-18 and 22 in Block B-17. Another three exploratory wells were drilled in the new Block B-17-01.

===Production===
Twenty two gas fields have been declared in the JDA. As of the end of 2007, approximately 8.5 trillion standard cubic feet of proved and probable gas reserves have been discovered in the 22 fields. Some of these fields also have minor oil accumulations. The fields are:
:'''Block A-18 (nine fields):'''
:*Cakerawala
:*Bulan
:*Suriya
:*Bumi
:*Bumi East
:*Senja
:*Samudra
:*Wira, and
:*Samudra North
:'''Block B-17 (10 fields):'''
:*Muda
:*Tapi
:*Jengka
:*Amarit
:*Mali
:*Jengka South
:*Jengka West
:*Jengka East, and
:*Muda South
:'''Block B-17-01 (three fields):'''
:*Tanjung
:*Jinda, and
:*Andalas

The main production complex in '''Block A-18''' is the '''Cakerawala Production Complex''' which is located at the Cakerawala gas field. It was completed in May 2002 and production began with 19 wells (14 wells on Cakerawala A platform and 5 wells on Cakerawala B platform) on 2 January 2005. Seven wells were later developed on Cakerawala. The initial contracted production level under Phase One was {{convert|390|e6cuft/d|m3/d}}.

In 2006, Phase Two commenced with the development of the Bumi, Suriya and Bulan fields as well as the expansion of Cakerawala C to sustain an additional contracted production level of {{convert|400|e6cuft/d|m3/d}}. The gas is piped to a receiving facility in [[Songkhla]], Thailand and then piped to Malaysia where it feeds into the Peninsula Gas Utilisation system. An additional 5 wells were drilled on Cakerawala C, while 11 wells were drilled on Bumi A and seven wells on Suriya A. Drilling is still in progress in Bulan A. The additional gas is to be consumed by Thailand.

Construction for the production complex in '''Block B-17''' is in progress and production is expected to begin in October 2009. An initial contract production level of {{convert|270|e6cuft/d|m3/d}} has been signed. The gas is to be consumed by Thailand.

==Administering the area==

===The joint authority===
The joint development area is administered by the '''Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority''' on behalf of the two governments. The authority is recognised as a statutory body in both countries and is given full rights to exploit and develop non-living natural resources in the joint development area. The authority was created in 1991 and has its headquarters in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]].

===The board===
The authority is governed by a board with members consisting of equal representatives of Malaysian and Thai nationals (seven from each side) as appointed by the respective Governments. Under the supervision of authority's board, the MTJA management consists of staff covering technical, legal and financial aspects of the petroleum business.

'''The MTJA board:'''

'''Co-chairmen:''' Abu Talib Othman (Malaysia), Sivavong Changkasiri (Thailand)

'''Members:''' Mohd Hassan Marican (President/Chief Executive Officer
[[Petronas]], Malaysia),  Pornchai Rujiprapa (Permanent-Secretary, Ministry of Energy, Thailand), Dr Sulaiman Mahbob (Director-General, Economic Planning Unit, Prime Minister's Department, Malaysia), Admiral Werapon Waranon (Commander-in-Chief, Royal Thai Navy, Thailand), Dr Halim Man (Secretary-General, Ministry of Energy, Water and Telecommunications, Malaysia), Porntip Jala (Secretary-General, Office of The Council of State, Thailand), Othman Hashim (Deputy Secretary-General I, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Malaysia), Krairit Nikuha (Director-General, Department of Mineral Fuels, Ministry of Energy, Thailand), Aziyah Baharuddin (Secretary, Tax Analysis Division, Ministry of Finance, Malaysia), Piyabhan Nimmanhaemin (Director-General, Comptroller-General's Department, Ministry of Finance, Thailand), Idrus Harun (Head, Advisory and International Law Division, Attorney-General's Chambers, Malaysia), and Virachai Plasai (Director-General, Department of Treaties and Legal Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thailand).

CPOC serves as the Operator under the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) dated 21 April 1994 between Petronas Carigali JDA Ltd (‘PCJDAL’) and PTTEPI in respect of the exploration and exploitation of petroleum under the Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’) dated  21 April 1994 between the Malaysia – Thailand Joint Authority (MTJA) Block B-17 and C-19.
Located in the area of overlapping continental shelf claimed by both Malaysia and Thailand at the lower part of Gulf of Thailand near the South China Sea. Geological, this overlapping area, situated in the northern part of the prolific Malay Basin, is known for its hydrocarbon potential. Under this Joint Operating Agreement (JOA’), PCJDAL and PTTEPI each entitled to a fifty per cent (50%) participating interest of all rights, interests, privileges, duties and obligations.
The signed Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) between MTJA, PCJDAL and PTTEPI (as Sellers) and PTT Public Company Limited (as Buyer) which was signed on 16 June 2005 will marked the milestone for future gas export via PTT pipeline from the field to onshore facilities in Thailand. The first gas will be expected by 1 July 2008.
In September 2002, MTJA made an exclusive offer to PCJDAL and PTTEPI to jointly acquire the relinquished areas of Blocks A-18, B-17 and C-19 in the MTJDA under a new PSC. This relinquished area with an area 3475 square kilometres, is known as Block B-17-01 signed between PCJDAL and PTTEPI simultaneously on 30 September 2004, CPOC has also been designated the Operator for Block B-17-01. Both PCJDAL and PTTEPI have a fifty per cent (50%) participating interest of all rights, interests, privileges, duties and obligations under this JOA. Discoveries from these activities will open up to business expansion for CPOC.
Since its inception in 1994, CPOC had carried extensive exploration activities leading to successful 9 gas field discoveries namely Muda, Tapi, Jengka, Amarit, Mali, Jengka West, Jengka South, Jengka East and Muda South. The major gas filed in the block, Muda, is about 260&amp;nbsp;km from Songkhla in Southern Thailand and about 380&amp;nbsp;km from Kemaman supply base in East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The current activity for CPOC Block B-17 is on the field development planning stage (FDP), whereas Block B-17-01 is currently in the Exploration stage.
The objective of Block B-17 development is to deliver the required Daily Contractual Quantity (270 MMSCFD sustained for next 10 years and 250 MMSCFD for the following 6 years) within HSE standards and at lowest total cost.

'''Mangindusa''', is one of the four highly revered gods in the [[Tagbanua mythology]], is also known as the "lord of the heavens."

Mangindusa dwells in a sacred area called '''Awan-awan''', a place lying beyond the ''langit'', in a region between the sky world and the earth. He lives with his wife '''Bugawasin''', his messengers, and other celestial beings. 

While Mangindusa is considered the highest-ranking deity, there is no traditional ascription to him as the sole "creator" of the world, although Christian mythology has had some influence in imbuing Mangindusa with more powers than he used to possess. In fact, the creation of the world and of human beings is said to have been the handiwork of the ''[[diwata]]''. 

Mangindusa has always been traditionally considered the punisher of ''dusa'' ([[crime]]). In Tagbanua society, the only recognized public dusa is ''sumbang'' ([[incest]]). In this case, Mangindusa holds the society responsible for the ''sumbang''. Mangindusa's punishment of the society may take the form of withholding the rains. In the past, society punished the offenders by drowning them in the sea. In present society, a huge fine is imposed and in top of this a special ''lumbay'' ritual must given in honor of Mangindusa.&lt;ref name="tagbanua"&gt;[http://litera1no4.tripod.com/tagbanua_frame.html Tagabanua by Mark Joel Velasquez].

[[Image:Kongo audience.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Manikongo giving audience to his subjects and Portuguese visitors]]

The '''Manikongo''' or '''Mwene Kongo''' was the title of the ruler of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], a kingdom that existed from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries and consisted of land in present-day [[Angola]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. The manikongo's seat of power was [[M'banza-Kongo]] (also called ''São Salvador'' in 1570–1975), now the capital of [[Zaire Province]] in Angola. The manikongo appointed governors for the provinces of the Kingdom and received tribute from neighbouring subjects.

The term "manikongo" is derived from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] "manicongo", an alteration of the [[KiKongo]] term ''Mwene Kongo'' (literally "lord of Kongo"). The term "wene", from which "mwene" is derived, is also used to mean kingdom, and is attested with this meaning in the Kongo catechism of 1624 with reference to the Kingdom of Heaven. The term "mwene" is created by adding the personal prefix ''mu-'' to this stem,  to mean  "person of the kingdom".

''Mani'' is attested in very early texts, notably the letters of [[Afonso I of Kongo|King Afonso I of Kongo]], where he writes, to [[List of Portuguese monarchs|kings]] [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] (in 1514) and [[João III of Portugal|João III]] concerning the "manipango" (mwene Mpangu). Mani was used to mean not only "king", but also anyone holding authority, so provincial and sub-provincial officials also were called "mani".

'''Media development''' involves [[capacity building]] for [[institutions]] or individuals related to [[freedom of expression]], [[:wikt:pluralism|pluralism]] and [[Concentration of media ownership|diversity]] of media, as well as [[Media transparency|transparency]] of [[media ownership]]. Media [[Development aid|development]] plays a role in [[democracy]] and effective democratic [[discourse]] through supporting [[Freedom of information|free]] and [[independent media]].

==Support for Media Development==
International donors and other organizations often include support for media development as part of their overall support to international economic and democratic development. Typical efforts to develop independent media development include: journalist training and education; support for and advice on improving the legal and business environment for media; efforts to improve the sustainability of existing outlets; [[media literacy]] training; [[digital media]] training and integration; [[Infrastructure#Communications infrastructure|infrastructure]] development; and monitoring and evaluation efforts.

==Indicators for Media Development==

===UNESCO Media Development Indicators===

[[UNESCO]] developed Media Development Indicators in 2008 as a framework for international media development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/media-development-indicators-a-framework-for-assessing-media-development |title=Media Development Indicators: A framework for assessingmedia development |publisher=UNESCO |date=|accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indicators are within five categories:

===Media Sustainability Index===

The [[International Research and Exchanges Board]]’s (IREX) [[Media Sustainability Index]] (MSI) is another widely used tool to evaluate the global development of independent media. The MSI is one of the most important indices "to assess how media systems change over time and across borders."

The MSI uses five fundamental objectives to assess to what extent a media system is independent, sustainable and successful. The five objectives are:
*"Legal and social norms protect and promote free speech and access to public information.
*Journalism meets professional standards of quality.
*Multiple news sources provide citizens with reliable, objective news.
*Media are well-managed enterprises, allowing editorial independence.
*Supporting institutions function in the professional interests of independent media".

==Media development vs. media for development==
Some development organizations and experts make a distinction between media development and media for development. Support for "Media development" refers to efforts to directly improve the media in a society (through the means mentioned above). "Media for development" refers to using existing media to convey messages about specific development issues. Such efforts include many [[ICT for Development (ICT4D)]] projects. Media for Development has been applied to education, healthcare, business, disaster relief, corruption, minority empowerment, and local community engagement, among other development goals.

==Media development organizations==
While development of the media sector is a common activity of many development organizations, there are a small number that engage in direct media development as their primary purpose. In the U.S., the three main media development implementers are Internews, the International Center for Journalists, and IREX.

===United States-based groups involved in direct media development===

====Institute for War and Peace Reporting====
{{Main|Institute for War and Peace Reporting}}
The Institute for War and Peace Reporting is an international media development charity, established in 1991. IWPR supports local reporters, citizen journalists and civil society activists in countries in conflict, crisis and transition around the world. It trains, mentors and provides platforms for professional and citizen reporters; builds up the institutional capacity of media and civic groups; and works with partners to remove barriers to free expression, robust public debate and citizen engagement. IWPR operates major programmes in Afghanistan, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Iraq, the Balkans, Congo DRC, Tunisia and Uganda.

====Internews====
{{Main|Internews}}
Internews is an international media development organization whose mission is to empower local media worldwide to give people the news and information they need, the ability to connect, and the means to make their voices heard.

Internews has worked in over 70 countries and trained over 80,000 people in media skills. Together with local partners, Internews activities include establishing and supporting media outlets, journalist associations, and broadcast networks. Internews also has special programs to improve reporting on the environment, humanitarian crises, public health and women’s issues.

Formed in 1982, Internews Network is a 501(c)(3) organization headquartered in California. The organization currently works in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America.&lt;ref&gt;Internews, "About Internews," http://www.internews.org/about/default.shtm.&lt;/ref&gt;

====ICFJ====
{{Main|ICFJ}}
The International Center for Journalists is a non-profit, professional organization located in Washington, D.C., that promotes quality journalism worldwide in the belief that independent, vigorous media are crucial in improving the human condition. Since 1984, the International Center for Journalists has worked directly with more than 55,000 journalists from 176 countries. Aiming to raise the standards of journalism, ICFJ offers hands-on training, workshops, seminars, fellowships and international exchanges to reporters and media managers around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;International Center for Journalists, "About Us," http://icfj.org/AboutUs/tabid/202/Default.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

ICFJ operates the [http://knight.icfj.org Knight International Journalism Fellowships program], which sends media professionals from around the world to developing nations to improve the media there.&lt;ref&gt;ICFJ, "Our Program: Promoting the Free Flow of News in the Public Interest," http://knight.icfj.org/AboutUs/ProgramOverview/tabid/830/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

ICFJ also operates the International Journalists’ Network (IJNet), which serves as an online resource for journalists around the world to communicate with one another and improve their own journalism standards and practices.&lt;ref&gt;International Journalists' Network, "About Us," https://www.ijnet.org/ijnet/about-us.&lt;/ref&gt;

====IREX====
{{Main|International Research &amp; Exchanges Board}}
International Research &amp; Exchanges Board (IREX) is an international nonprofit organization providing leadership and innovative programs to improve the quality of education, strengthen independent media, and foster pluralistic civil society development. IREX designs education programs and provides consulting that support lifelong learning. Programs focus on primary and secondary levels, through higher education, and continuing into professional training.&lt;ref&gt;IREX, "IREX Mission," http://irex.org/about/index.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;

IREX also publishes the [[Media Sustainability Index]] (MSI), which provides in-depth analyses of the conditions for independent media in 76 countries across Africa, Europe, Eurasia, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;IREX, "MSI Overview," http://irex.org/msi/index.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media Development Investment Fund====
{{Main|Media Development Investment Fund}}
Media Development Investment Fund (MDIF), formerly Media Development Loan Fund, is a New York-registered [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit corporation and mission-driven investment fund that provides low-cost financing to independent news outlets in countries with a history of media oppression. Through low-cost capital (mainly loans), business training and other advice and support, it aims to help news outlets committed to responsible journalism become commercially sustainable, believing that only financially independent news media can stay editorially independent over the long term.

In 1998 MDIF also founded CAMP (Centre for Advanced Media-Prague)which provided technology support to independent media in developing countries. In 2010, MDIF spun off CAMP as an independent organization, [[Sourcefabric]], whose mission is to provide independent media outlets with the open source software, tools and support they need to produce the news. In 2013 Media Development Loan Fund changed its name to Media Development Investment Fund.

===American government organizations involved in media development===
The U.S. government provides about half of American funding of media development abroad.

====USAID====
The [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] is the largest single U.S. funder, public or private, of independent media abroad. It spent $52.7 million in 2006 on international media sector development—about 37 percent of American funding, according to a study by the [[Center for International Media Assistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for International Media Assistance, ''Empowering Independent Media: U.S. Efforts to Promote Free and Independent News Around the World'' (Washington: CIMA, 2007), http://www.ned.org/cima/CIMA-Empowering_Independent_Media.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

USAID’s '''Office of Democracy and Governance (DCHA/DG)''' manages roughly $500,000 annually for media-related work. The bureau has two full-time media experts on staff who are consulted on media projects around the world.

USAID’s '''Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI)''', which was created in 1994 to provide a quick response mechanism in times of crisis, including post-war situations, spent $3 million on international media sector development in 2006.

The '''Europe and Eurasia Bureau (E&amp;E)''' currently manages $130,000 annually to support publication of the Europe and Eurasia Media Sustainability Index, but its influence extends well beyond that amount. E&amp;E’s media advisor works with mission offices in the region, where most funding decisions are made, on how best to allocate resources for media work.

====U.S. State Department====
The [[State Department]]’s largest single funder of independent media sector development is its Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), which spent $11.8 million on the sector in 2006. U.S. embassies, through ambassadors’ funds and other sources, also provide considerable funding of local media projects. Other State Department bureaus, such as the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, also support international media work.

The '''[[Middle East Partnership Initiative]] (MEPI)''', which was created in 2002 to promote democracy in the Middle East, included approximately $3 million to support independent media in 2006.

====BBG====
The '''[[Broadcasting Board of Governors]]''' is responsible for all U.S. government-sponsored, nonmilitary broadcasting for international audiences. This includes the [[Voice of America]], [[Alhurra]], [[Radio Sawa]], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, [[Radio Free Asia]], and [[Radio y Televisión Martí|Radio and TV Martí]]. BBG’s total budget for fiscal year 2006 was $645 million, of which $1.5 million went to the training of international journalists, according to the CIMA survey.

====MCC====
The '''[[Millennium Challenge Corporation]]''', founded in 2004, is a government corporation tasked with assisting some of the world’s poorest countries. Dollar amounts are tied to countries’ progress on several key indicators, including improved press freedom. MCC has incorporated media development in at least five of the countries: Malawi, Moldova, Niger, Tanzania, and Ukraine.

===Other United States-based groups===

====The Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA)====
The Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA) is an initiative of the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] (NED). CIMA works to improve the development of independent media worldwide while working to strengthen the support for such development. The center works to improve the effectiveness of existing media development efforts by conducting research and bringing together a broad range of experts to share their experiences. CIMA's mission is based on the conviction that free and independent media play an indispensable role in developing sustainable democracies around the world.

====Knight Foundation====
The [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]] “promotes excellence in journalism worldwide and invests in the vitality of 26 U.S. communities where the Knight brothers owned newspapers.” The Knight Foundation is one of the largest funders of direct media assistance in the U.S. It is also responsible for helping fund and launch some of the most innovative programs in media development, including GFMD and the Knight News Challenge.

Knight also funds the Knight International Journalism Fellowships (along with the Gates Foundation).&lt;ref&gt;http://knight.icfj.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

====OSF====
[[Open Society Foundations]] (formerly known as the Open Society Institute, OSI) is a network of foundations founded by billionaire George Soros. While it once operated primarily in Eastern Europe, it now has programs worldwide. Though OSF is the largest private funder of media development, media is only a part of OSF’s activities, particularly in the following programs: Information Program, Media Program, and Open Society Justice Initiative.

===Other U.S. funders of media assistance===
There are a number of foundations and other organizations in the U.S. that are responsible for a significant amount of media assistance funding, yet without a program engaged in direct “media development.” These projects are often called “communications for development” and are a very common form of media development.

====The National Endowment for Democracy (NED)====
The [[National Endowment for Democracy]] (NED) is a U.S. non-profit soft power organization that was founded in 1983 to promote democracy. It is funded primarily through an annual allocation from the U.S. Congress, within the budget of USAID, the U.S. agency for development assistance, which is part of the U.S. State Department. Although administered as a private organization, its funding mostly comes from a governmental appropriation by Congress but was created by The Democracy Program as a bipartisan, private, non-profit corporation. In addition to its grants program, NED also supports and houses the Journal of Democracy, the World Movement for Democracy, the International Forum for Democratic Studies, the Reagan–Fascell Fellowship Program, the Network of Democracy Research Institutes, and the Center for International Media Assistance.

====Freedom House====
[[Freedom House]] does two major surveys every year – Freedom in the World, and Freedom of the Press. Along with IREX’s MSI and Reporters Without Borders’ Press Freedom Index, this is one of the essential indexes of press freedom worldwide. Unlike the MSI, it covers every country in the world, but does not do so in depth (though still provides a brief analysis of each country).

====USIP====
The [[U.S. Institute of Peace]] is funded by the government much like NED is. However, its board is appointed by Congress, so they lack the independence that NED has. USIP’s media programming is part of its larger goal to promote peace worldwide.

====Search for Common Ground====
[[Search for Common Ground]] does some journalism training as well as producing material for radio and TV stations in various locations around the world. Their media arm is called Common Ground Productions.

====Other advocacy organizations====
'''[[Reporters Without Borders]]'''—RSF monitors press freedom violations and releases an annual Press Freedom Index that ranks countries based on their score, with a higher number indicating more press freedom violations.

'''[[Committee to Protect Journalists]]'''—CPJ is a nonprofit that “defends the rights of journalists to report the news without fear of reprisal.” It also keeps track of journalists injured or killed worldwide.

'''[[The Dart Center for Journalists &amp; Trauma]]'''—based at the University of Washington, Dart does workshops on journalist safety.

'''[http://www.developingradiopartners.org/ Developing Radio Partners]'''—DRP is a nonprofit that develops community radio in developing countries.

'''[[The Poynter Institute]]'''—Poynter trains journalists online and on site at its St. Petersburg, Florida campus.

'''[[Investigative Reporters and Editors]]'''—IRE, based at the University of Missouri, is the world’s oldest and largest association of investigative journalists and it trains several thousand journalists each year.

The '''[[International Women's Media Foundation]]'''—IWMF is a global network of women journalists that runs leadership and training seminars in 22 countries.

'''[http://www.visualeditors.org/ Visual Editors]''' is a non-profit charity that provides online resources for developing journalists and low-cost seminars in four countries.

====Academic programs====
There are a number of academic programs at universities around the country that do work on media development issues or engage in media development of their own.

The [[University of Pennsylvania]]’s [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School of Communication]] has a '''[http://www.global.asc.upenn.edu Center for Global Communication Studies]''' (CGCS)

[[George Washington University]]’s [[School of Media and Public Affairs]] (SMPA)

[[Johns Hopkins University]]’s [[School of Advanced International Studies]] (SAIS) runs an '''[http://www.internationalreportingproject.org/ International Reporting Project]''' that works with U.S. journalists to encourage more international reporting

[[Harvard University]]’s '''[[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]]''' often publishes reports on relevant topics in media assistance

The [[Nieman Foundation]] (also at Harvard) runs a fellowship program for journalists (both U.S. and international) to come learn at Harvard

[[Stanford University]] runs a similar fellowship program called the '''[http://knight.stanford.edu/ John S. Knight Fellowships for Professional Journalists]'''

===International groups involved in media development===

====BBC World Service Trust====
The [[BBC World Service]] Trust is a British implementer that does direct media development work. It is active in over 40 countries and on every continent.

The Trust is funded by external grants and voluntary contributions, mainly from the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), the European Union, UN agencies, and charitable foundations. They also receive a small amount of core support from the BBC (both in kind and cash).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/trust/&lt;/ref&gt;

====DW Akademie - Deutsche Welle====
[http://www.dw-akademie.de DW Akademie] is [[Deutsche Welle]]'s international center for media development, media consulting and journalism training based in Bonn and Berlin. It offers its partners and clients around the world a broad range of training and consulting projects.

In Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia, DW Akademie engages in long-term partnerships with local broadcasters and media institutions.

DW Akademie’s work is financed through public funding provided mainly by the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the German Foreign Ministry and the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw-akademie.de&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internews Europe ====
[http://www.internews.eu Internews Europe] is an international development organisation that specialises in supporting independent media and free information flows in fragile states, emerging democracies and some of the world’s poorest countries. In doing so, it strives to promote good governance, human rights, effective response to humanitarian crises and access to information on critical issues such as the environment and climate change. 
Wherever Internews Europe works, it seeks to build the long term capacity of local media and other players in the information ecosystem to develop resilient and reliable communication flows for the benefit of the wider population.

====DFID====
The [[Department for International Development]] is the British government's main foreign aid agency. It is a significant funder of media development around the world. Similar to USAID (see above), media development is often a secondary goal within larger projects.

====Journalists for Human Rights====
{{Main|Journalists for Human Rights}}

[[Journalists for Human Rights]] (JHR) is an international media development [[non-governmental organization]] whose goal is "to make everyone in the world fully aware of their rights".&lt;ref name="jhr1"&gt;"[http://www.jhr.ca/en/index.php Journalists for Human Rights.] Organization website&lt;/ref&gt; The organization believes that "creating awareness is the first and most necessary step to ending rights abuses. By mobilizing the media to spread human rights awareness, jhr informs people about their rights, empowering marginalized communities to stand up, speak out and protect themselves".&lt;ref name="jhr1" /&gt;

As Canada's largest media development organization, jhr has offices in Toronto, Canada (Head Office); Freetown, Sierra Leone; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Monrovia, Liberia. It also has representatives and non-profit status in the United States and the United Kingdom and operations in Ghana and Malawi.

jhr focuses its programming and efforts on strengthening the local media in countries with some level of freedom in the press, training local journalists on improving their human rights reporting skills. The organization is a pioneer in [[Rights Media]], a new category of media development that has been defined as the “process of writing, collecting, editing, producing and distributing media that creates societal dialogue on human rights issues”.&lt;ref name="rightsmedia"&gt;[http://www.jhr.ca/en/aboutjhr_rightsmedia.php What is Rights Media?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818055155/http://www.jhr.ca/en/aboutjhr_rightsmedia.php |date=2011-08-18 }} Journalists for Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt; The only NGO in the world focused exclusively on human rights reporting, jhr's work in [[Rights Media]] aims to bridge the contentious divide between two camps in the sector: traditional 'media development' proponents and 'communication for development' practitioners. The former of the two focuses on developing infrastructure and professional capacity of media professionals and outlets. The latter focuses on getting particular messages into the public domain through the media. [[Rights Media]] does both — it focuses on building capacity of local media outlets to effectively get messages to the general public.&lt;ref name="meddev"&gt;[http://www.jhr.ca/en/aboutjhr_mediadevelopment.php jhr and Media Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818055150/http://www.jhr.ca/en/aboutjhr_mediadevelopment.php |date=2011-08-18 }} Journalists for Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multilateral organizations involved in media development===

====UNDP====

The [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/about-us/who-we-are/whos-who/freedom-of-expression-and-media-development-fem/ Division of Freedom of Expression and Media Development] (FEM), which is charged with implementing activities that promote the free flow of information, is where most media development work is implemented and funded.

====The World Bank Institute====
The [[World Bank Institute (WBI)]] is the capacity development branch of the [[World Bank]]. It provides learning programs, policy advice and technical assistance to policy makers, government and non-government agencies and development practitioners of developing countries. Capacity for Development is defined by the WBI as "the ability of individuals, institutions, and whole societies to solve problems, make informed choices, order their priorities and plan their futures, as well as implement programs and projects, and sustain them over time" 

The WBI’s media program works with partners and media practitioners to leverage independent media to participate in key public functions through demand-driven and responsive media coverage of budget formulation, implementation, as well as monitoring, oversight, and performance management. The program is facilitating both South-South and North-South knowledge exchanges by serving as a space for experts and practitioners to share investigative journalism practices and strategies to overcome obstacles to effective reporting on priority development topics. 

The Communications for Governance and Accountability Program (CommGAP), was a global program at the World Bank that promoted the use of communication in governance reform programs and supported the building of democratic public spheres. CommGAP was dissolved in October, 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4074">The [[World Economic Forum]]'s '''Networked Readiness Index''' (NRI), also referred to as '''Technology Readiness''', measures the propensity for countries to exploit the opportunities offered by information and communications technology (ICT). It is published in collaboration with [[INSEAD]], as part of their annual '''Global Information Technology Report''' (GITR). The report is regarded as the most authoritative and comprehensive assessment of how ICT impacts the competitiveness and well-being of nations.&lt;ref name="Tech-ready"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://knowledge.insead.edu/entrepreneurship-innovation/the-worlds-most-tech-ready-countries-2015-3953 |title=The World’s Most Tech-Ready Countries 2015 |date=April 15, 2015 |publisher=INSEAD Knowledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wef"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-information-technology-report-2015/press-releases/ |title=Global Information Technology Report 2015 |date=15 April 2015 |publisher=World Economic Forum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The index was originally developed by the Information Technology Group, which worked at Harvard University's Center for International Development until 2002.  It seeks to better understand the impact of [[Information technology|ICT]] on the competitiveness of nations and is a composite of three components: 
*the environment for ICT offered by a given country or community (market, political, regulatory, and infrastructure environment)l
*the readiness of the country's key stakeholders (individuals, businesses, and governments) to use ICT
*the usage of ICT among these stakeholders.

'''PBS Satellite Service''' or "HD01" (formerly '''PBS Schedule X''' in Eastern Time, with the west coast delay signal designated PBS-XD) is the 24-hour network feed from the [[PBS]] that provides a mixed variety of programming selected from PBS's regular network service.  In the X/XD years was [[multicast]] by some PBS member stations on an over-the-air [[digital television|DTV]] subchannel along with their regular programming, or during overnight hours on their main channel to provide a second opportunity for viewers to watch or record primetime programming.

As of 2015, the PBS Satellite Service can be received unscrambled via satellite on these coordinates:

* '''PBS-HD01''' on the [[AMC-21]] satellite (at 125°W), on: [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band]] [[transponder]] 22 (12140&amp;nbsp;MHz), vertical polarity, [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]], unencrypted.
* The defunct '''PBS-X''' (east/west, with the western feed tagged "XD") and other secondary PBS services (such as [[PBS Kids]] (in standard definition) are or had been also on the AMC-21 satellite as [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band]] [[transponder]] 24 (12180&amp;nbsp;MHz, vertical polarity), unencrypted.

Currently, select stations broadcast the feed, usally overnight, like [[KGTF]] (PBS Guam, broadcasts most of the channel as a  localised feed) The channel is also available over satellite providers like [[DirecTV]] (Channel: 389) This channel along with a national feed of [[Ion Television]] (Channel: 305 east, 306 west) is available to viewers of DirecTV (and other providers, PBS stations provide  all of their channels free to TV providers) who do not receive local channels.

==Logo==

Currently, PBS Satellite uses the national [[PBS]] logo.

==Scheduling==
PBS Satellite Service is freely and nationally available from AMC-21 at 125°W using free-to-air satellite dishes as small as three feet.

PBS Satellite Service provides two free national feeds in each format, one scheduled for the Eastern U.S., the other, PBS-XD, on a three-hour delay to fit timezone differences for the West Coast. These services have been succeeded by the 1080i high-definition digital feeds PBS [[HD01]] and [[HD02]].

'''Sky Italia''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[digital television|digital]] [[satellite television]] platform owned by [[Sky Limited|Sky]]. It is similar in many ways to [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Sky Ireland]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], which is owned by [[Comcast]], and like that network it is a major sports broadcaster. Sky Italia also broadcasts three national FTA digital terrestrial channels: [[TV8 (Italy)|Tv8]], [[Cielo (TV channel)|Cielo]] and [[Sky TG24]]. As of 2018, following an agreement with [[Mediaset]], Sky Italia also operates a series of digital terrestrial pay-tv channels offering sports, entertainment and movies.   

[[Pay television|Pay TV]] services on Sky Italia satellite platform are encrypted in [[Cisco Videoscape|NDS]] [[VideoGuard]]. The VideoGuard set-top boxes that have been provided since July 2010 are identical to the [[Sky+ HD]] boxes used in the UK. [[Pace plc|Pace]], [[Amstrad]] (itself owned by Sky) and [[Technicolor SA|Thomson]], all Digibox licensors, have been producing Sky Italia boxes (Sky Box, Sky HD, My Sky and My Sky HD) identical to their Sky Digital, [[Sky+]] and [[Sky+ HD]] offerings, albeit with the potential removal of the second card slot and UHF modulator.

==History==
Sky Italia was founded in July 2003 by the merger of [[TELE+]] and [[Stream TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communicating Europe: Italy Manual|url=http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/enlargement_debates_manual_italy.pdf|publisher=European Stability Initiative|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=19 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 2010 Sky Italia has been giving the 'Sky Digital Key' and the [[My Sky HD]] box for free to every new customer (since July 2009 HD channels have been available with no extra cost to all Sky Italia subscribers). The 'Sky Digital Key' is a [[USB]] device which has to be connected to the 'My Sky HD' box and to the aerial cable, allowing the customer to receive every [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] SD and HD free channel on the Sky HD or My Sky HD box.

The 'My Sky' boxes launched on 22 November 2005 - based on a new digital receiver with HDD recording capabilities and surround sound output (not previously available on the normal box). Subsequently, the 'My Sky HD' boxes (High Definition with HDD recorder) were added. The 'My Sky HD' service had been provided with an extra charge until July 2010, when it became a base-line service. The service is functionally identical to the [[BSkyB]] [[Sky+ HD]].

On 28 June 2010, Sky Italia changed its brands and logos, making them identical to the BSkyB ones.

Sky Italia offers eight packages of channels: five base-level 'Channel Packs' and three optional 'Sky Packs' enhancements. The 'Channel Packs' are: 'Entertainment' with 33 variety, series and semi-[[generalist channel|generalist]] channels (3 of them in HD); 'Documentaries and Lifestyle' with 17 channels (2 of them in HD); 'Music' with 16 channels and 27 audio channels; 'Kids' with 21 channels; 'News' with 15 national, local  and international news channels and 5 basic sport channels. The 'Sky Packs' are the following: 'Cinema' with 12 movie channels (10 of them in HD), and a 3D channel, ''Sky Cinema 3D'' ([[Pay-per-view|PPV]] [[Sky Primafila]] movies are 50% off for 'Cinema' subscribers); 'Sport' with 8 channels (5 of them in HD), and a 3D channel, ''Sky Sport 3D''; 'Calcio' with 15 channels (9 of them in HD) covering Italian and international [[association football|football]], the most popular sport in [[Italy]], along with [[Sky Sport (Italy)|Sky Sport 24]] (sport all-news channel), offered as bonus channel for 'Calcio' subscribers. The 'Sky Primafila' service offers pay-per-view movies, sport events and adult content (at night); the pay-per-view movies and some non-sport events are disseminated in 28 'Primafila' channels (8 of them in HD); one channel airs daily ''Penthouse TV'' HD programmes, available as a stand-alone premium channel. [[Sky Primafila]] has got some similarities to [[BSkyB]]'s [[Sky Box Office|Sky Movies Box Office]].

The [[High-definition television|HD]] service has been offered without any extra charge since 2009. There are 37 HDTV channels so far broadcasting on Sky, due to become 50 by the end of 2011.

On 1 October 2010, Sky activated its first [[3D television|3D]] channel, '''Sky Sport 3D''', available without any extra cost to the Sport pack subscribers. The very first event Sky Sport 3D aired was the [[2010 Ryder Cup]]. On 25 December 2010, Sky launched another 3D channel: '''Sky Cinema 3D''', airing 3D movies, available for free for Cinema pack subscribers. These channel have been replaced by '''Sky 3D''' on 6 September 2011.

On many channels, foreign-sourced content is broadcast either with an option to choose between Italian and English language soundtracks (rarely other languages), or with Italian subtitles.

Sky Italia uses the [[Hot Bird]] 6/8/9 satellites at 13.0°E, the same satellite fleet used by [[RAI]], [[Tivù Sat]], [[NOVA Greece]], [[NOVA Cyprus]], [[Cyfra+]] and [[Cyfrowy Polsat]].

[[Tom Mockridge]], the then head of Sky Italia replaced [[Rebekah Brooks]] as chief executive of [[News UK|News International]] after she had resigned on 15 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Samira Shackle|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/07/james-murdoch-resignation|title=Ed Miliband calls for the break-up of the Murdoch Empire|work=New Statesman|date=15 July 2011|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrea Zappia]] replaced [[Tom Mockridge]] as CEO on 1 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/spettacolo/2011/08/01/visualizza_new.html_760038048.html|title=Sky: Andrea Zappia nuovo ad Sky Italia |language=Italian|work=ANSA|date=8 January 2011|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 2011 Sky Italia announced it reached the 5 million subscribers benchmark.

Following [[News Corporation]]'s split into two on 28 June 2013 to create two separate companies, [[21st Century Fox]] (the re-branded News Corporation), and the spin-off company New [[News Corp]], the 100% stake held by News Corporation in Sky Italia was retained by the re-branded 21st Century Fox.

Following media speculation, on 12 May 2014 Sky Italia's sister company, [[BSkyB]], confirmed that it was in talks with its largest shareholder, [[21st Century Fox]], about acquiring 21st Century Fox's 57.4% stake in [[Sky Deutschland]] and its 100% stake in Sky Italia. The enlarged company would be likely to be called "Sky Europe" and it will consolidate 21st Century Fox's European digital TV assets into one company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2014/statement_on_potential_acquisition ''Statement on potential acquisition'', BSkyB 12 May 2014].

'''Somali nationalism''' ([[Somali language|Somali]]:''Soomaalinimo'') is centered on the notion that the [[Somalis|Somali people]] share a common language, religion, culture and ethnicity, and as such constitute a nation unto themselves. The ideology's earliest manifestations are often traced back to the resistance movement led by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]]'s [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]] at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi. ''Culture and Customs of Somalia''. Westport, Connecticut, Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc, 2001. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In northwestern present-day [[Somalia]], the first Somali nationalist political organization to be formed was the [[Somali National League]] (SNL), established in 1935 in the former [[British Somaliland]] [[protectorate]]. In the country's northeastern, central and southern regions, the similarly-oriented Somali Youth Club (SYC) was founded in 1943 in [[Italian Somaliland]], just prior to the [[Trust Territory of Somalia|trusteeship period]]. The SYC was later renamed the [[Somali Youth League]] (SYL) in 1947. It became the most influential political party in the early years of post-independence Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi. ''Culture and Customs of Somalia''. Westport, Connecticut, Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc, 2001. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{History_of_Somalia}}
Early Somali nationalism developed in the beginning of the 20th century with the concept of "Greater Somalia" that encompassed  a theme, Somalis are a nation with a distinct identity and wanted to unite inhabited areas of Somali clans. ''Pan-Somalism'' refers to the vision of reunifying these areas to form a single Somali nation. The pursuit of this goal has led to conflict: Somalia engaged after [[World War II]] in the [[Ogaden War]] with Ethiopia over the Ogaden region, and supported Somali [[Shifta War|insurgents]] against Kenya.

===Prehistory===
Somalia has been inhabited since at least the [[Paleolithic]].

They used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the ''[[beden]]'' to transport their cargo.

After the [[Nabatea#Roman annexation|Roman conquest of the Nabataean Empire]] and the Roman naval presence at [[Aden]] to curb piracy, Arab and Somali merchants agreed with the Romans to bar Indian ships from trading in the free port cities of the Arabian peninsula&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Warmington|1995|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to protect the interests of Somali and Arab merchants in the lucrative commerce between the Red and Mediterranean Seas.&lt;ref name="EHW"&gt;{{Harvnb|Warmington|1995|p=229}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Indian merchants continued to trade in the port cities of the Somali peninsula, which was free from Roman interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Warmington|1995|p=187}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, Indian merchants brought large quantities of cinnamon to Somalia and Arabia from [[Ceylon]] and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. The source of the cinnamon and other spices is said to have been the best-kept secret of Arab and Somali merchants in their trade with the Roman and Greek world; the Romans and Greeks believed the source to have been the Somali peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Warmington|1995|pp=185–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The collusive agreement among Somali and Arab traders inflated the price of Indian and Chinese cinnamon in North Africa, the Near East, and Europe, and made the cinnamon trade a very profitable revenue generator, especially for the Somali merchants through whose hands large quantities were shipped across sea and land routes.&lt;ref name="EHW"/&gt;

===Early Modern Era and the Scramble for Africa===
{{Main|Geledi sultanate|Majeerteen Sultanate|Sultanate of Hobyo|Dervish movement (Somali)}}
In the [[early modern]] period, successor states of the [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]], [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran]] and [[Hiraab Imamate]], [[Hiraab]] began to flourish in Somalia. These included the [[Warsangali Sultanate]], the [[Bari, Somalia|Bari Dynasties]], the [[Sultanate of Geledi]] (Gobroon dynasty), the [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] (Migiurtinia), and the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] (Obbia). They continued the tradition of castle-building and seaborne trade established by previous Somali empires.

Sultan [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]], the third Sultan of the House of Gobroon, started the golden age of the Gobroon Dynasty. His army came out victorious during the Bardheere Jihad, which restored stability in the region and revitalized the East African [[ivory trade]]. He also received presents from and had cordial relations with the rulers of neighbouring and distant kingdoms such as the Omani, [[Wituland|Witu]] and Yemeni Sultans.

Sultan Ibrahim's son [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]] succeeded him and was one of the most important figures in 19th-century East Africa, receiving tribute from Omani governors and creating alliances with important Muslim families on the East African coast. In northern Somalia, the Gerad Dynasty conducted trade with Yemen and Persia and competed with the merchants of the Bari Dynasty. The Gerads and the Bari Sultans built impressive palaces and fortresses and had close relations with many different empires in the Near East.

In the late 19th century, after the [[Berlin conference]] of 1884, European powers began the [[Scramble for Africa]], which inspired the Dervish leader [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] to rally support from across the Horn of Africa and begin one of the longest colonial resistance wars ever. In several of his poems and speeches, Hassan emphasized that the British "have destroyed our religion and made our children their children" and that the Christian Ethiopians in league with the British were bent upon plundering the political and religious freedom of the Somali nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Saadia Touval|title=Somali Nationalism: International Politics and the Drive for Unity in the Horn of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ycGAAAACAAJ|date=September 1999|publisher=Iuniverse Inc|isbn=978-1-58348-411-1|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon emerged as "a champion of his country's political and religious freedom, defending it against all Christian invaders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Richard H. Shultz]]|author2=Andrea J. Dew|title=Insurgents, terrorists, and militias: the warriors of contemporary combat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Byyw38C377MC&amp;pg=PA67|year=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-12982-4|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hassan issued a religious ordinance stipulating that any Somali national who did not accept the goal of unity of Somalia and would not fight under his leadership would be considered to be [[kafir]], or ''gaal''. He soon acquired weapons from the Ottoman Empire, Sudan, other Islamic and Arabian countries, and appointed ministers and advisers to administer different areas or sectors of Somalia. In addition, he gave a clarion call for Somali unity and independence, in the process organizing his forces.

Hassan's Dervish movement had an essentially military character, and the Dervish movement was fashioned on the model of a [[Salihiya]] brotherhood. It was characterized by a rigid hierarchy and centralization. Though Hassan threatened to drive the Christians into the sea, he executed the first attack by launching his first major military offensive with his 1500 Dervish equipped with 20 modern rifles on the British soldiers stationed in the region. He repulsed the British in four expeditions and had relations with the [[Central Powers]] of the Ottomans and the Germans. In 1920, the Dervish movement collapsed after intensive aerial bombardments by Britain, and Dervish territories were subsequently turned into a protectorate.

The dawn of [[fascism]] in the early 1920s heralded a change of strategy for Italy, as the north-eastern sultanates were soon to be forced within the boundaries of ''La Grande Somalia'' according to the plan of Fascist Italy. With the arrival of Governor [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]] on 15 December 1923, things began to change for that part of Somaliland known as [[Italian Somaliland]]. Italy had access to these areas under the successive protection treaties, but not direct rule.

The Fascist government had direct rule only over the [[Benadir]] territory. [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]], under [[Benito Mussolini]], attacked Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1935, with an aim to colonize it. The invasion was condemned by the [[League of Nations]], but little was done to stop it or to liberate occupied Ethiopia. On 3 August 1940, Italian troops, including Somali colonial units, crossed from Ethiopia to [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|invade British Somaliland]], and by 14 August, succeeded in taking [[Berbera]] from the British.

A British force, including troops from several African countries, launched the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|campaign in January 1941]] from Kenya to liberate British Somaliland and Italian-occupied Ethiopia and conquer Italian Somaliland. By February, most of Italian Somaliland was captured and in March, British Somaliland was retaken from the sea. The forces of the British Empire operating in Somaliland comprised the three divisions of South African, West African, and East African troops. They were assisted by Somali forces led by [[Abdulahi Hassan]] with Somalis of the [[Isaaq]], [[Dhulbahante]], and [[Warsangali]] clans prominently participating.

===Ogaden campaign===
{{main|Ogaden War}}
In July 1977, the [[Ogaden War]] against [[Derg|Ethiopia]] broke out after Barre's government sought to incorporate the predominantly Somali-inhabited [[Ogaden]] region into a Pan-Somali [[Greater Somalia]]. In the first week of the conflict, Somali armed forces took southern and central Ogaden and for most of the war, the Somali army scored continuous victories on the Ethiopian army and followed them as far as [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]]. By September 1977, Somalia controlled 90% of the Ogaden and captured strategic cities such as [[Jijiga]] and put heavy pressure on [[Dire Dawa]], threatening the train route from the latter city to Djibouti. After the siege of [[Harar]], a massive unprecedented Soviet intervention consisting of 20,000 [[Cuba]]n forces and several thousand Soviet advisers came to the aid of Ethiopia's communist [[Derg]] regime. By 1978, the Somali troops were ultimately pushed out of the Ogaden. This shift in support by the Soviet Union motivated the Barre government to seek allies elsewhere. It eventually settled on the Soviet Union's [[Cold War]] arch-rival, the [[United States]], which had been courting the Somali government for some time. All in all, Somalia's initial friendship with the Soviet Union and later partnership with the United States enabled it to build the largest army in Africa.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham"&gt;Oliver Ramsbotham, Tom Woodhouse, ''Encyclopedia of international peacekeeping operations'', (ABC-CLIO: 1999), p.222.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Water''' (UN-Water) coordinates the efforts of [[United Nations]] entities and international organizations working on [[water]] and [[sanitation]] issues. 
:''″Over 30 UN organizations carry out water and sanitation programmes, reflecting the fact that water issues run through all of the UN’s main focus areas. UN-Water’s role is to coordinate so that the UN family ‘delivers as one’ in response to water related challenges.″'' (citation UN Water)

== Issues ==
[[Water]] is at the core of sustainable development and is critical for socio-economic development, healthy [[ecosystems]] and for human survival itself. Ecosystems across the world, particularly wetlands, are in decline in terms of the services they provide. Between US$4.3 and US$20.2 trillion per year worth of [[ecosystem services]] were lost between 1997 and 2011 due to [[land use]] change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6630/full/387253a0.html|title=Nature {{!}} UN-Water|work=UN-Water|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Water is vital for reducing the global burden of disease and improving the health, welfare and productivity of populations. Today, 2.1 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking [[water]] services and 4.5 billion people lack safely managed [[sanitation]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://washdata.org|title=WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) {{!}} UN-Water|work=UN-Water|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is also at the heart of adaptation to [[climate change]], serving as the crucial link between the climate system, human society and the environment. Without proper water governance, there is likely to be increased competition for water between sectors and an escalation of water crises of various kinds, triggering emergencies in a range of water-dependent sectors. By 2025, 1.8 billion people are expected to be living in conditions with absolute [[water scarcity]], and two-thirds of the world population could be under water stress conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr4-2012/|title=World WaterDevelopment Report 2012{{!}} UN-Water|work=UN-Water|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical world of water is closely bound up with the socio-political world, with water often a key factor in managing risks such as [[famine]], migration, epidemics, inequalities and political instability. Since 1900, more than 11 million people have died as a consequence of [[drought]] and more than 2 billion have been affected by drought, more than any other physical hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/aq191e/aq191e.pdf|title=FAO Drought{{!}} UN-Water|work=UN-Water|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

UN-Water members and partners inform about water and sanitation policies, monitor and report on progress, and coordinate two annual global campaigns on [[World Water Day]] and [[World Toilet Day]].

=== Key policy processes ===

UN-Water members and partners have helped embed water and sanitation in recent agreements such as the [[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] (which led to the [http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)]), the 2015-2030 [[Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction]], the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, and the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] within the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Convention Framework on Climate Change]].

=== Monitoring and reporting ===

To meet the needs of the 2030 Agenda, UN-Water launched the Integrated Monitoring Initiative for [[Sustainable Development Goals#Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation|SDG 6]], building on and expanding the experience and lessons learned during the MDG period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/integrated-monitoring-guide-sdg-6|title=Integrated Monitoring Guide for SDG 6 - AR, CH, EN, FR, RU, SP {{!}} UN-Water|work=UN-Water|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the custodian agencies of the SDG 6 global indicators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/sdg-6-indicators-tiering-system|title=SDG 6 indicators and the tiering system {{!}} UN-Water|work=UN-Water|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; have come together under the initiative, which includes the work of [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP)]], the inter-agency initiative GEMI and UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwater.org/publication_categories/glaas|title=UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) Archives {{!}} UN-Water|website=UN-Water|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campaigns ===
{{main article|World Water Day|World Toilet Day}}
Every year, UN-Water coordinates the United Nations [[List of international observances|international observances]] on freshwater and sanitation: World Water Day and World Toilet Day. Depending on the official UN theme of the campaign, they are led by one or more UN-Water Members and Partners with a related mandate. On World Water Day, UN-Water releases the [[UN World Water Development Report|World Water Development Report]] focusing on the same topic as the campaign.

== Governance ==

=== Members and Partners ===
UN agencies, programmes and funds with a water-related mandate are Members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwater.org/about-unwater/members/|title=UN-Water Members {{!}} UN-Water|website=UN-Water|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UN-Water. Partners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwater.org/about-unwater/partners/|title=UN-Water Partners {{!}} UN-Water|website=UN-Water|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; are international organizations, professional unions, associations or other civil-society groups that are actively involved in water and that have the capacity and willingness to contribute tangibly to the work of UN-Water.

=== Senior Programme Managers ===
The UN-Water Senior Programme Managers are the representatives of the UN-Water Members at UN-Water. They provide the overall governance and strategic direction. Collectively, they constitute the highest operational decision-making body of UN-Water.

=== Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary ===
The Chair of UN-Water is nominated among the UN Executive Heads, after consultations in the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination. The Vice-Chair of UN-Water is elected among the UN-Water Senior Programme Managers.

== History ==
1977: The UN’s Intersecretariat Group for Water Resources coordinates UN activities on water and has a three-person secretariat in the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ (UN-DESA)]] predecessor in New York.

1992: The Group is subsumed into the UN Administrative Coordination Committee’s (ACC) Subcommittee on Water Resources, which functions for several years before being disbanded. Members continued to meet informally to continue collaborating around water issues.

1993: The UN General Assembly designates 22 March as [[World Water Day]].

2003: UN-Water is established, endorsed by the successor to the ACC: the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unsystem.org/|title=Home {{!}} United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination|website=www.unsystem.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2005-2015: UN-Water coordinates the ‘Water for Life’ International Decade for Action, culminating in the [[International Year of Sanitation|Sanitation Drive to 2015]], a campaign to meet the 2000-[[Millennium Development Goals|2015 Millennium Development Goals’]] sanitation target and end open defecation.

2012: The Key Water Indicator Portal is launched, backed by a federated database containing data from several UN agencies.

2013: The UN General Assembly designates 19 November as [[World Toilet Day]].

2014: UN-Water launches its 2014-2020 Strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/un-water-strategy-2014-2020/|title=UN-Water Strategy 2014-2020 {{!}} UN-Water|work=UN-Water|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in support of the 2030 Agenda.

2015: The 2030 Agenda’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]] are launched and a dedicated goal on water and sanitation is adopted by the UN General Assembly with input from UN-Water’s Technical Advice Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/executive-summary-post-2015-global-goal-water-en-fr-sp/|title=Executive Summary: A Post-2015 Global Goal for Water (EN, FR, SP) {{!}} UN-Water|work=UN-Water|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2016: The Integrated Water Monitoring initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/suivi-en-matiere-deau-et-dassainissement-dans-lagenda-2030-pour-le-developpement-durable-une-introduction|title=Monitoring Water and Sanitation in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development – An introduction EN, FR, SP {{!}} UN-Water|work=UN-Water|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is launched with the aim of reporting on progress on water and sanitation in a coherent and coordinated way.

The '''War in North-West Pakistan''', also known as the '''War in Waziristan''', is an armed conflict involving [[Pakistan]], and armed militant groups such as the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan]] (TTP), [[Jundallah (Pakistan)|Jundallah]], [[Lashkar-e-Islam]] (LeI), [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi|TNSM]], [[al-Qaeda]], and their [[Central Asia]]n allies such as the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province|ISIL–Khorasan]] (ISIL), [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]], [[Turkistan Islamic Party|East Turkistan Movement]], [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Caucasus Province|Emirate of Caucasus]], and elements of [[Organized Crime in Pakistan|organized crime]].&lt;ref name="scribd1"&gt;Varun Vira and Anthony Cordesman [https://www.scribd.com/doc/70694522/Pakistan-Violence-Versus-Stability "Pakistan: Violence versus Stability: A Net Assessment."] ''[[Center for Strategic and International Studies]]'', 25 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/24/AR2006012401528.html |title=The War in Pakistan |work=The Washington Post |date= 25 January 2006|accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3645114.stm |title=Pakistan's undeclared war |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |author=Zaffar Abbas |date= |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi|TNSM]] established in 1992 allied with the TTP and LeI.

==Names for the war==
Various names have been applied to the conflict by the authors and historians. War in North-West Pakistan is the most commonly used name in English. It has also been called the Waziristan War, and the War in Waziristan. On the other hand, political scientist, [[Farrukh Saleem]], termed the war as the "Fourth Generation War" or the "4G War".&lt;ref name="The News International Sunday, April 29, 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Farrukh Salim |title=4G War |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-105618-4G-War |accessdate=7 June 2013 |newspaper=The News International Sunday, 20 April 2002 |date=29 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715184736/http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-105618-4G-War |archivedate=15 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Battle of Tora Bora]] (lit.

In 2003, the troubles mounted as the [[Pashtun tribes|Tribes]] began to see military's deployment and repeated [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]]'s flights in the region as an act of subjugation.&lt;ref name="Dawn, 10 2003"&gt;{{cite news|last=By Our Staff Reporter |title=Wana operation condemned |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2003/10/06/nat5.htm |accessdate=1 July 2013 |newspaper=Dawn, 10 2003 |date=6 October 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021150348/http://archives.dawn.com/2003/10/06/nat5.htm |archivedate=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003–04 public speeches, Musharraf repeatedly called for the eviction of the [[Foreign fighters in the Bosnian War|foreign fighters]] from the [[South Waziristan]] and justified the army deployments in the region despite the concerns.&lt;ref name="Dawn archives, 2003"&gt;{{cite news|last=Our Reporter |title=Occupation of sovereign states by US flayed |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2003/08/10/nat7.htm |accessdate=1 July 2013 |newspaper=Dawn archives, 2003 |date=10 August 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021145856/http://archives.dawn.com/2003/08/10/nat7.htm |archivedate=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2003, at least two assassination attempts against President [[Pervez Musharraf]] were traced to South Waziristan. The government responded by intensifying military pressure on the area. However, the fighting was costly: government forces sustained heavy casualties throughout 2004 and into early 2005, when the government switched to a tactic of negotiation instead of direct conflict.&lt;ref name=rohde&gt;{{cite news | title = Al Qaeda Finds Its Center of Gravity | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/10/weekinreview/10rohde.html | first = David | last = Rohde |work=New York Times | date = 10 September 2006 | accessdate =12 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2004, a bloody mountainous battle between the Pakistan Army troops and the [[Foreign Mujahideen|foreign fighters]] of [[al-Qaeda]] was fought in the [[Safēd Kōh|White Mountains]] of [[South Waziristan]].&lt;ref name="Dawn news, area studies, Zulfiqar Ali"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dawn news |author2=area studies |author3=Zulfiqar Ali |title=Musharraf warns against failure of Wana operation |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2004/03/16/top4.htm |accessdate=2 July 2013 |newspaper=Dawn news, area studies, Zulfiqar Ali |date=16 March 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232920/http://archives.dawn.com/2004/03/16/top4.htm |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Media of Pakistan|Pakistani media]] speculated that Pakistan Army had surrounded a "''[[high value target]]''" in the mountainous region, possibly [[al-Qaeda]]'s then-second-in-command [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]].&lt;ref name="Dawn News, 2004 Area studies, Khan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Khan|first=Ismail|title=Al Zawahiri believed surrounded: Intensity of resistance indicates presence of high-value target, says Musharraf|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2004/03/19/top2.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130702065607/http://archives.dawn.com/2004/03/19/top2.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 July 2013|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=Dawn News, 2004 Area studies, Khan|date=19 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|military intelligence]] in 2004, all militants were [[Chechen people|Chechens]], [[Uzbeks]], and [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] who were trying to flee [[Tora Bora|''Black Caves'']] ([[Tora Bora]] of [[Afghanistan]]).&lt;ref name="Dawn news, area studies, Zulfiqar Ali"/&gt; After a week of the battle, the entire area was captured and as many as 400 al-Qaeda operatives were apprehended by the Pakistan Army.&lt;ref name="Dawn, March 26, 2004"&gt;{{cite news|last=Khan |first=Ismail |title=Army winding up operation: Corps Commander |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2004/03/26/top3.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130702065643/http://archives.dawn.com/2004/03/26/top3.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 July 2013 |accessdate=2 July 2013 |newspaper=Dawn, 26 March 2004 |date=26 March 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of its success, the army failed to capture Zawahiri.

===Peace deals===
In April 2004, the [[Government of Pakistan]] signed the Shakai agreement, first of three peace agreements with militants in [[South Waziristan]]. It was signed by militia commander [[Nek Muhammad Wazir]], but was immediately abrogated once Nek Muhammad was killed by an American [[Hellfire missile]] in June 2004.

&lt;ref name="scribd1"/&gt; The second one, Sararogha Peace Agreemen, was signed in February 2005 with Nek's successor [[Baitullah Mehsud]], which brought relative calm in the [[South Waziristan]] region. This deal would later, in September 2006, be mimicked in the neighboring [[North Waziristan]] territory as the third and final truce, Miranshah Peace Accord, between the government and the militants. However, all of these truces would not have a substantial effect in reducing bloodshed.&lt;ref name=rohde /&gt; The latter two deals were officially broken in August 2007 with the start of [[Lal Masjid siege|Operation Silence]] which was initiated by Islamabad, and resulted in a [[List of terrorist incidents in Pakistan since 2001|tenfold increase]] in suicide attacks on Pakistan Armed Forces.&lt;ref name="globalbearings1"/&gt;

The strategy of keeping the air force and navy out from the conflict proved to be ineffective, as the violence spread out all over the country, and the army came under great pressure from the militants in 2004–07.&lt;ref name="Dawn, April 17, 2007"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff |title=Extremism greatest threat: president |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2007/04/17/top5.htm |accessdate=8 June 2013 |newspaper=Dawn, 17 April 2007 |date=17 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020204852/http://archives.dawn.com/2007/04/17/top5.htm |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, General Ehsan-ul-Haq admitted publicly that keeping the navy and the air force out of the conflict was a mistake.&lt;ref name="Dawn, Our Correspondent" /&gt;

The [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]'s [[Inter-Services Intelligence#Departments|Covert Action Division]] (CAD) and the [[Special Services Group]] conducted a secret paramilitary operation to capture a high-ranking [[al-Qaeda]] operative [[Abu Faraj al-Libbi]] on 4 May 2005, after a raid outside the town of [[Mardan]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} northeast of Peshawar.&lt;ref name="Dawn News area studies archives, 2005"/&gt; His arrest was confirmed by the [[Government of Pakistan|Government sources]] and noted as "[[Abu Faraj al-Libbi|al-Libbi]] was a high ranking al-Qaeda official, rumored to be third after [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]]."&lt;ref name="Dawn News area studies archives, 2005"&gt;{{cite news|last=Raza |first=Syed Irfan |title=Al Qaeda's number three Faraj Al Libbi arrested |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2005/05/05/top1.htm |accessdate=2 July 2013 |newspaper=Dawn News area studies archives, 2005 |date=5 May 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329102824/http://archives.dawn.com/2005/05/05/top1.htm |archivedate=29 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Libbi replaced [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]] after his arrest in March 2003 in connection with the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]].&lt;ref name="Dawn News area studies archives, 2005"/&gt; The Pakistan government arrested al-Libbi and held him on charges in relation to being a chief planner in two assassination attempts on the life of President Pervez Musharraf in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-05-04-pakistan-arrest_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA |title=Pakistan reports arrest of Osama bin Laden's operations chief | author=John Diamond |work=USA Today |date=4 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 January 2006, the [[United States Air Force]] launched an [[Damadola airstrike|airstrike on the village of Damadola]].&lt;ref name="Dawn News archives, area studies 2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anwarullah Khan |title=Attack in Bajaur Agency kills 18: Raid believed to be made by US aircraft |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2006/01/14/top3.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130702061415/http://archives.dawn.com/2006/01/14/top3.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 July 2013 |accessdate=2 July 2013 |newspaper=Dawn News archives, area studies 2006 |date=14 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack occurred in the [[Bajaur]] tribal area, about {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Afghan border, and killed at least 18 people.

===Ceasefire===
On 21 June 2006, pro-Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan militants in the [[Bannu]] region of [[North Waziristan]] stated they shot down a Bell military helicopter that was reported to have crashed. The government denied missile fire as the cause, stating it was due to technical faults. The helicopter had taken off from a base camp in Bannu at around 7&amp;nbsp;am for Miramshah and crashed 15 minutes later into the Baran Dam in the Mohmandkhel area on Wednesday morning. Four soldiers were killed while three others were rescued. On the same day militants killed an inspector and two constables on a road connecting Bannu and the main town of [[Miranshah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Policemen killed' in Waziristan | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5104784.stm |work=BBC News | date = 22 June 2006 | accessdate =7 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2006, Afghan [[Taliban]] leader [[Sirajuddin Haqqani]] issued a decree that it was not (Afghan) Taliban policy to fight the [[Pakistan Army]]. However, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan intentionally did not circulate the decree in North Waziristan thereby keeping pressure on the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/2006/06/23/top2.htm |title=Forces, militants heading for truce |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=22 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628133630/http://www.dawn.com/2006/06/23/top2.htm |archivedate=28 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|2007 in Pakistan|2007 timeline of the War in Waziristan}}
As early as 2007, the northern region had been suffering with an insurgency and President Musharraf was increasingly under great pressure from the militants when several army operations outlined mixed results. In March, his government was forced{{By whom|date=October 2016}} to sign a peace treaty with [[Faqir Mohammed|Fakir Mohamad]], the main militant leader in [[Bajaur Agency|Bajaur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Pakistan signs the Bajaur Accord| author =Roggio B| publisher =The Long War Journal| date=17 March 2007| url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2007/03/pakistan_signs_the_b.php}} Retrieved on 14 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bajaur: When 'Peace' Yields War |author=Stakelbeck E |publisher=CBN News |date=3 April 2007 |url=http://www.cbn.com/CBNnews/130966.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215041911/http://www.cbn.com/CBNnews/130966.aspx |archivedate=15 December 2007 }} Retrieved on 14 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Militant groups then held three districts in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]]: [[South Waziristan]], [[North Waziristan]] and [[Bajaur Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Roggio B| title =The fall of northwestern Pakistan: An online history| publisher =The Long War Journal| url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2006/09/the_fall_of_wazirist.php}} Retrieved on 13 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waziri–Uzbek tensions===
{{Main|East Turkestan Islamic Movement}}

In [[South Waziristan]], the [[Terrorism in Uzbekistan|Uzbek militancy]] had been growing as many former Soviet [[Foreign Mujahideen|fighters]]–turned militants were reportedly seen encircling in the area; many of the [[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|military intelligence reports]] indicated the movements of former Soviet fighters in the region, mostly [[Uzbeks]] and [[Chechnya|Chechens]] from the troubled areas of [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis"&gt;{{cite report|last=Zaidi|first=Dr. Syed Manzar Abbas|title=Uzbek Militancy in Pakistan|work=SISA Report No. 1 2013|publisher=Centre for International and Strategic Analysis|format=Microsoft Word|date=4 February 2013|url=http://strategiskanalyse.no/publikasjoner%202013/2013-02-04_SISA1_Uzbek_Militancy_in_Pakistan_-_Syed_Manzar_Abbas_Zaidi.pdf|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the fighting sparked between the Uzbek fighters and the native militant groups by the killing of [[Arabic people|Arab]] fighter [[Saiful Adil]], an al-Qaeda operative, blamed on the Uzbeks fighters by [[Maulvi Nazir]], described as a top pro-Taliban militant commander in the region.&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis"/&gt; According to the other version, the fighting started after Maulvi Nazir, whom the government claimed had come over to its side, ordered the Uzbek followers of former [[Soviet Army|Soviet fighters]], [[Tohir Yo'ldosh|Tohir Abduhalilovich Yo'ldoshev]] and [[Najmiddin Jalolov|Kamolitdinich Jalolov]], to disarm, both were formerly the close confidants of [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis"/&gt;

It was also preceded by the clashes between the [[Tohir Yo'ldosh|Yo'ldoshev]]-led [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan|IMU]] and a pro-government tribal leader in Azam Warsak, in which 17–19 people died before a ceasefire was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Rival militants clash in Pakistan |publisher=BBC| date=20 March 2007| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6470299.stm}}{{Failed verification|date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeat of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan===
{{Main|Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan}}
[[File:Map of FATA in Pakistan.PNG|thumb|[[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|Military intelligence map]]: In 2007, the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan|Uzbek IMU]] dominated the [[South Waziristan]] before forced out from the country by tribes and the armed forces in 2008.]]

According to the [[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|military intelligence]] officials in 2007, there were many key reasons why the [[Uzbekistan|Uzbeks]] had been dominating the area.&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis" /&gt; Military intelligence reports testified that the locals were scared to mobilize the opposition against the [[Terrorism in Uzbekistan|Uzbek militants]] due to their reputations as fierce fighters with long memories and very strong military backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis" /&gt; Some of these fighters used to be soldiers and officers in the [[Soviet Army]] during the [[Russian war in afghanistan|Russian invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]] in the 1980s, and some of them had military training given by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] during the 1990s; hence they were experts in [[guerrilla warfare]].&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis" /&gt; The IMU fighters had little to lose and it was difficult for them to escape somewhere else. They couldn't go back to Uzbekistan, and after 2009, re-infiltration back to Afghanistan also started becoming more difficult.&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis" /&gt; Thus, they made Waziristan their home.&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis" /&gt; Local militants allied to the tribesmen were reported attacking and seizing the IMU's private jail in Azam Warsak.&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis" /&gt; The Pakistan Army intelligence said it did not intend to step in, but witnesses say government artillery fired on the Uzbek fighters they set up to fight the tribesmen.&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis" /&gt;

Heavy fighting resumed on 29 March 2007, ending a week-long ceasefire between tribal fighters and foreign militants. According to initial reports, tribesmen attacked a checkpoint manned by former [[Soviet army|Soviet]] [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek fighters]] and captured two of them. The clashes also left one tribal fighter dead and three wounded.&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis" /&gt; The following day, a senior Pakistani official announced that 52 people were killed during the past two days; 45 of them were Uzbeks and the rest tribesmen. One of Maulvi Nazir's aides put the death toll at 35 Uzbeks fighters and 10 tribal fighters. However, residents in the area said that the death toll on both sides was inflated.&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis" /&gt;

The conflict further escalated on 2 April when a council of elders declared jihad against foreign militants and started to raise an army of tribesmen.&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis" /&gt; According to Pakistani intelligence officials, heavy fighting concentrated in the village of Doza Ghundai left more than 60 people dead, including 50 foreigners, 10 tribal fighters and one Pakistani soldier. Intelligence officials also said that "dozens of Uzbeks" had surrendered to tribal forces and that many bunkers used by militants were seized or destroyed.&lt;ref name="Centre for International and Strategic Analysis" /&gt;

On 12 April 2007, the army general in charge of South Waziristan said that tribal fighters had cleared the Soviet Uzbeks out of the valleys surrounding [[Wana (Pakistan)|Wana]] and the foreign fighters had been pushed back into the mountains on the [[Tora Bora|Afghan border]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Tribesmen 'oust' foreign fighters | author =Plett B|publisher=BBC| date=12 April 2007| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6547783.stm}} Retrieved on 16 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, the local tribesmen has urged [[Islamabad]] to resume control of law and order in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Tribe in Pakistan security plea |publisher=BBC| date=16 April 2007| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6559365.stm}} Retrieved on 16 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lal Masjid siege and truce broken===
{{main|Siege of Lal Masjid|Waziristan Accord|July 2007 Pakistan bombings}}

The [[Lal Masjid siege|siege]] of [[Lal Masjid, Islamabad|Lal Masjid]] was one the serious breach in the conflict and escalated the conflict in the summer of 2007. On 3&amp;nbsp;July 2007, the militant supporters of Lal Masjid and the [[Pakistan police]] clashed in Islamabad after the students from the mosque attacked and stoned the nearby [[Ministry of Environment (Pakistan)|MoE secretariat]]. Their resultant faceoff with the military escalated, despite the intervention of then-ruling [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)|PML(Q)]] leaders [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain|Shuja'at Hussain]] and [[Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq|Ijaz-ul-Haq]]. The Pakistan police, aided by the [[Pakistan Army Rangers]] immediately put up a siege around the mosque complex which lasted until 11 July and resulted in 108 deaths. This represented the main catalyst for the conflict and eventual breakdown of the truce that existed between Pakistan and the Taliban groups. Already during the siege, there were several attacks in Waziristan in retaliation for the siege.

As the siege in Islamabad ensued, several attacks on Pakistan army troops in Waziristan were reported. First attack was reported on 14 July 2007 when a suicide bomber attacked a Pakistan Army convoy killing 25 soldiers and wounding 54. Second attack was on 15 July 2007, two suicide bombers attacked another Pakistan Army convoy killing 16 soldiers and 5&amp;nbsp;civilians and wounding another 47 people. And in a separate incident, a fourth suicide bomber attacked a police headquarters killing 28 police officers and recruits and wounding 35 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,289340,00.html |title=FOXNews.com – Two Days of Homicide Attacks Kill 70 in Pakistan |publisher=Fox News|date=15 July 2007 |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairuse.100webcustomers.com/fairenough/nytA31.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311092541/http://fairuse.100webcustomers.com/fairenough/nytA31.html|archivedate=11 March 2008 |title=Suicide Bombers Kill 49 in Pakistan |publisher=Fairuse.100webcustomers.com |author=Ismail Khan |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assault on the Red Mosque prompted Islamic militants along the border with Afghanistan to scrap the controversial [[Waziristan Accord]] with Musharraf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6905808.stm |title=Scores killed in Pakistan attacks |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pakistani soldiers in Swat - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|left|Pakistan airborne forces captured the highest point in [[Swat valley]], 2009.]]
Under pressured, Musharraf moved the army in large concentration of troops into Waziristan and engaged in fierce clashes with militants in which at least 100 militants were killed including wanted terrorist and former [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] detainee, [[Abdullah Mehsud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070724/ap_on_re_as/pakistan_militant_leader |accessdate=23 September 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The militants also struck back by attacking Army convoys, security check points and sending suicide bombers killing dozens of soldiers and police and over 100&amp;nbsp;civilians. In one month of fighting during the period from 24 July to 24 August 2007, 250 militants and 60 soldiers were killed. On 2 September 2007, just a few dozen militants led by [[Baitullah Mehsud]] managed to ambush a 17-vehicle army convoy and captured an estimated 247 soldiers without a shot being fired, an event that shocked the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6978240.stm|title=Pakistan crisis 'hits army morale'|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several officers were among the captured, the public criticism grew hard on Musharraf.

After the army returned to Waziristan, they garrisoned the areas and set up check-points, but the militants hit hard. In mid-September, the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]] and other forces attacked a number of Pakistan army outposts all across North and South Waziristan. This resulted in some of the heaviest fighting of the war. Following the [[Lal Masjid Siege]], the first outpost was attacked and overrun by the militants resulting in the capture of 12 Pakistani soldiers. The next day on 13 September 2007, a suicide bomber in [[Tarbela Ghazi]] attacked a Pakistan army base, destroying the main mess hall and killing 20 members of the [[Special Service Group|SSG ''Karrar'' Commando Unit]]; Pakistan's most elite army unit. A series of attacks ensued and by 20 September 2007, a total of five Pakistan Army military outposts had been overrun and more than 25 soldiers captured. More than 65 soldiers were either killed or captured and almost 100 wounded. A little over two weeks later, the Army responded with helicopter gunships and ground troops. They hit militant positions near the town of [[Mir Ali, Pakistan|Mir Ali]]. In [[Battle of Mir Ali|heavy fighting]] over four days, 257 people were killed, including 175 militants, 47 soldiers and 35 civilians.

===Operation Rah-e-Haq===
{{main|First Battle of Swat}}
[[File:Pak-army-sol.jpg|thumb|A soldier of Pakistan army in combat position.]]

By the end of October 2007, another heavy fighting erupted in the Swat district of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province]] between the [[Frontier Police]] and the large portion of [[Far-right politics|far right-wing]] [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi|TNSM]] organization, under the command of [[Maulana Fazlullah]] who was trying to impose Sharia law. In a response, the military deployed a [[Stryker Brigade Combat Team|combat brigade]] under a local [[Brigadier-General]] to confront them. After week of heavy fighting with the [[Stryker Brigade Combat Team|brigade combat teams]], the battle came to a standstill with both sides suffering heavy casualties. On 3 November 2007, around ~220 paramilitary soldiers and policemen surrendered or deserted after a military position on a hill-top and two police stations were overrun. This left the [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi|TNSM]] in control of most of the Swat district.

The fighting in Swat is the first serious insurgent threat from terrorist groups in what is known as a settled area of Pakistan. Following this, [[Foreign Mujahideen|foreign fighters]] of [[al-Qaeda]] loyal to [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi|TNSM]]'s [[Maulana Fazlullah]] tried to implement strict Islamic law in November 2007. In November 2007, another [[brigade combat team]] was deployed with the help of helicopter gunships to crush the uprising. By the beginning of December 2007, the fighting had ended and the military recaptured Swat. Almost ~400 [[Foreign Mujahideen|foreign fighters]] of [[Maulana Fazlullah]] were dead along with 15 Pakistani soldiers and 20 civilians in the military suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/11/17/top7.htm |title=12-hour curfew clamped on Swat -DAWN – Top Stories; November 17, 2007 |publisher=Dawn.com |accessdate=19 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222115041/http://www.dawn.com/2007/11/17/top7.htm |archivedate=22 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the victory by the military, the [[Foreign Mujahideen|foreign fighters]] of TNSM slowly re-entered Swat over the coming months and started engaging security forces in battles that lasted throughout 2008. By early February 2009, the whole district was in military control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/20090130/wl_csm/oswat_1 ]{{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rawalpindi attacks and State of emergency in 2007===
{{main|September 2007 bombings in Rawalpindi|2007 Pakistani state of emergency}}
On 3 September 2007, the two coordinated suicide bombers targeted an [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] bus and a line of cars carrying ISI officers.{{citation needed|date=November 2007}} The bus attack killed a large number of Defence Ministry workers and the other attack killed an Army colonel. In all 31 people, 19 soldiers and 12 civilians, were killed.

Two months later on 24 November, another military intelligence (MI) bus was again attacked. Almost everyone on the bus was killed. Another bomber blew up at a military checkpoint. 35 people were killed, almost all military officials.{{citation needed|date=November 2007}} Facing with an intense criticism from media regarding the [[Operation Silence|Red Mosque siege]], President Musharraf became involved in a confrontation with the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|country's judiciary]] who began taking ''[[suo motu]]'' actions against the directives issued by Musharraf and his Prime Minister [[Shaukat Aziz]] on issues involving the forming of the investigative commission on [[Lal Masjid siege|Red Mosque]] as well as hearings of victims of the siege, the findings of [[Missing persons (Pakistan)|missing persons]], issuing verdicts against the controversial [[National Reconciliation Ordinance|NRO]] and [[Privatisation in Pakistan|privatization]], and issuing [[subpoena]] regarding the [[extrajudicial killing]] of [[Akbar Bugti]], in 2006. Failing to reach a compromise and subdue the judiciary, Musharraf authorized the decree of sacking around [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan|~70 senior justices]] including, the [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry|Iftikhar Chaudhry]], immediately and declared the [[Pakistan state of emergency 2007|state of emergency]] on 9 November 2007.

Though, this action and its responses are generally related to the controversies surrounding the re-election of Musharraf during the [[Pakistani presidential election, 2007|presidential election]] that had occurred on 6 October 2007, and also was claimed by the government to be the reaction to the actions by militants in Waziristan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2800993.ece| title =Pervez Musharraf spoils for a fight as he declares emergency rule| date=4 November 2007 |accessdate=4 November 2007 |work=The Times  | location=London | first1=Dean | last1=Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, President General Musharraf and his [[Pakistani military establishment|military establishment]] blamed the attack on [[al-Qaeda]], but this was contradicted following day, when [[Baitullah Mehsud]] sent a statement to the media saying that he and al-Qaeda had "no involvement in the murder of the former Prime Minister", and that they believed that Musharraf was responsible. The violence spread all over the country and national media broadcast the wave of violence across the country that left 58 people dead, including four police officers. Most of the violence was directed at Musharraf and his political party, [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)|PML(Q)]]. Opposition parties, notably the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]], branded PML(Q) as "''Qatil League''" (lit. Murderer's League). Benazir Bhutto had previously survived [[2007 Karachi bombing|an assassination attempt]] made on her life during her homecoming which left 139 people dead and hundreds wounded.&lt;ref name=nytimes_karachi&gt;{{cite news|first=Carlotta|last=Gall|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/world/asia/19pakistan.html|title=Bomb Attack Kills Scores in Pakistan as Bhutto Returns|author2=Masood, Salman |work=The New York Times|date=19 October 2007|accessdate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Zalzala===
{{Main|Operation Zalzala}}
After a brief intense change in [[chain of command]] in the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]], a full-fledged military operation called '[[Operation Zalzala|''Zalzala'']] (lit. ''earthquake'') was undertaken by [[14th Infantry Division (Pakistan)|14th Army Division]] in January with the goal of flushing out [[Baitullah Mehsud]]'s [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]] fighters from the area. The area had previously been a more or less safe zone for militants, with some villagers providing them support and shelter. The operation resulted in tactical success and scores of militants were killed during the operation, and within three days the armed forces were in full control of the area. The army later captured a few other villages and small towns as part of their attempt to pressure Baitullah Mehsud.&lt;ref&gt;Zaffar Abbas.

However, the operation led to a huge displacement of local population. According to the [[General Officer Commanding|GOC]] of the 14th Army Division's [[Major-General]] [[Tariq Khan (general)|Tariq Khan]], about 200,000 men, women and children, were displaced. Khalid Aziz, former chief secretary of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] and expert on tribal affairs, said the displacement was "one of the biggest in tribal history" adding that human cost of the conflict in Waziristan "has gone unrecorded."&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal Khattak.

Despite the agreement sporadic fighting continued until late June and escalated with the takeover of the town of Jandola on 24 June, by the militants. Around 22 pro-government tribal fighters were captured and executed by the TTP at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2008/06/24/top8.htm |title=Baitullah men storm Jandola -DAWN – Top Stories; June 24, 2008 |publisher=Dawn.com |accessdate=19 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918230202/http://www.dawn.com/2008/06/24/top8.htm |archivedate=18 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 2008, Pakistan Army started another offensive against militia fighters in [[Khyber Agency|Kyhber]], codenamed ''[[Operation Sirat-e-Mustaqeem|Sirat-e-Mustaqeem]]'' (lit. ''Righteous Path''). The military took control of a key town and demolished an insurgent group's building. In this offense, one militant was reportedly killed while two soldiers died in Swat valley.&lt;ref name=1billion/&gt; The operation was halted in early July. On 19 July 2008, clashes erupted between the TTP and a faction of pro-government Taliban militants. The fighting ended with 10–15 of the pro-government fighters were killed and another 120 were captured. Among the captured were two commanders who were tried under "Islamic" law by the Taliban and then executed.

On 21 July 2008, heavy fighting with another separatist group, the [[Balochistan Liberation Army|BLA]] in [[Baluchistan Province]], killed 32 militants, 9&amp;nbsp;soldiers and 2 civilians. More than two dozen militants were captured and a large weapons cache was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080721/wl_nm/pakistan_baluchistan_dc_1 |accessdate=21 July 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 28&amp;nbsp;July and 4 August 2008, heavy fighting flared up in the northwestern Swat valley leaving 94 militants, 28 civilians and 22&amp;nbsp;soldiers and policemen, were dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080804/wl_nm/pakistan_violence_dc_2 |accessdate=4 August 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 2008, the heavy ground fighting erupted in the Loisam area of the [[Bajaur district]]. The Loisam lies on the strategically important road leading towards the main northwestern city of Peshawar. The fighting started when hundreds of foreign fighters poured into the area and began attacking armed forces. After four days of fighting on 10 August 2008, the military was forced to withdraw from the area. It resulted in confirmed killing of 100 militants and 9 soldiers, and another 55&amp;nbsp;soldiers were missing, at least three dozen of them captured by the militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080810/wl_afp/pakistanafghanistanunrest_080810132035 |accessdate=10 August 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan10-2008aug10,0,6869936.story |title=Pakistan fighting ends as troops withdraw – Los Angeles Times |work=Los Angeles Times  |author1=Laura King  |author2=Zulfiqar Ali  |lastauthoramp=yes |date= 10 August 2008 |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the fighting was going on in Bajaur, in the Buner area of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province]], the militants killed at least nine policemen in an attack on a check post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/43/20080809/876/twl-taliban-militants-kill-nine-policeme_1.html |title=Taliban militants kill nine policemen in Pakistan – Yahoo!

===Tribal tension with TTP and US support for tribes===

[[File:The Khattak Tribe distribution today.jpg|thumb|In 2008, the [[Pashtun tribes]] declared the war against [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]].]]

As military retreat from [[Bajaur Agency]], the [[Pashtun tribes|Pakistani tribal elders]] began organizing a [[Private military company|private army]] of approximately 30,000 tribesmen to fight the TTP, with the support of the [[Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Provincial government]] in September 2008. This local [[private military company]], known as '''lashkar''' (lit. ''brigade''), had composed of Pakistani tribesmen who began burning the houses of militant commanders in Bajaur and vowed to fight them until they are expelled. During this campaign, the ''Lashkar'' torched the house of local militant commander named Naimatullah, who had occupied several government schools and converted them into seminaries. A tribal elder named Malik Munsib Khan quoted in [[Pakistani media|media]] that tribes would continue their struggle until the foreign fighters were expelled from the area, adding that anyone found sheltering militants would be fined one million rupees and their houses will be burned. The tribesmen also torched two important centres of the militant activity in the area and gained control tribal areas.

One of the main motivations for this activity was the operations that were taking place in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|FATA]] that had displaced some 300,000 people while dozens of citizens had been killed in clashes between the militants and military. Since the start of operations against the [[Foreign Mujahideen|foreign fighters]], some 150,000 tribesmen have sided with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/terrorism-security/2008/0901/p99s01-duts.html |title=Pakistani tribesmen organize private armies to fight Taliban|publisher=Csmonitor.com |author=David Montero |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcclatchydc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/226/story/53151.html |work=McClatchy Washington Bureau |date=26 September 2008 |title=Pakistani tribesmen organize to fight Taliban insurgents |author=Saeed Shah |accessdate=19 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928131039/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/226/story/53151.html |archivedate=28 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American military]] proposals outlined an intensified effort to enlist tribal leaders in the frontier areas of Pakistan in the fight against [[al-Qaeda]]. The proposal was modeled in part on a similar effort by [[United States Forces – Iraq|American forces]] in Iraq that had been hailed as a great success in fighting foreign insurgents there. But it raised the question of whether such partnerships can be forged without a significant American military presence in Pakistan. The American military raised great questions whether it is enough support can be found among the tribes. Small numbers of high-ranking officers of [[American military]] have served as advisers to the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] in the tribal areas, giving planning advice and helping to integrate American intelligence. Under this new approach, the number of advisers had to increase.

The [[American government|U.S. Government]] said these security improvements complemented a package of assistance from the [[US AID]] for the seven districts of the tribal areas that amounted to $750 million over five years, and would involve work in education, health and other sectors. The [[Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs|BINLEA]] of the US Government also assisted the [[Frontier Corps]] with financing for counter-narcotics work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/19/america/19policy.php |title=U.S. hopes to arm Pakistani tribes against Al Qaeda – International Herald Tribune |work=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=19 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119152243/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/19/america/19policy.php |archivedate=19 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/washington/19policy.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;ref=world&amp;adxnnlx=1222717017-fvB/geZ6uJD4OkQF6LCPSg&amp;oref=slogin |title=U.S. Hopes to Use Pakistani Tribes Against Al Qaeda|work=New York Times |author=Eric Schmitt, Mark Mazzetti And Carlotta Gall |date=19 November 2007 |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/sca/rls/2008/106495.htmcache:Fda3_xPQYTkJ:www.state.gov/p/sca/rls/2008/106495.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124195713/https://www.state.gov/p/sca/rls/2008/106495.htmcache:Fda3_xPQYTkJ:www.state.gov/p/sca/rls/2008/106495.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 January 2018 |accessdate=14 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a television emergency address, [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Asif Ali Zardari|Zardari]] and Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani|Gillani]] publicly vowed revenge in response to the Marriott Hotel bombing. By 26&amp;nbsp;September 2008, Pakistan air force and army had successfully conducted and completed a major joint offensive in the Bajaur and the Tang Khata regions of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, codenamed ''[[Battle of Bajaur|Operation Sherdil]]''.

At the end of August 2008, the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] stepped up its air attacks in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-09-08-voa15.cfm Suspected US Missile Strike Hits Taliban Commander's House] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913020249/http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-09-08-voa15.cfm |date=13 September 2008 }} – Voice of America, 8 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 2008, the [[United States Army]] [[United States Army Special Forces|Special Forces]] teams laid a [[Angoor Ada raid|commando attack]] in a village near the Afghan border in [[South Waziristan]]. Additional air strikes from unmanned drones in [[North Waziristan]] culminating on 8 September 2008, when a [[United States Air Force]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone aircraft]] fired a number of [[missiles]] at a "guest house for militants arriving in North Waziristan." Around ~23 people were killed, but the operation's target, [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]], was not among them.&lt;ref name=IHT20080909&gt;Perlez, J. &amp; Shah, P.Z. 2008, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/09/asia/09pstan.php 'US attack on Taliban kills 23 in Pakistan'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912140306/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/09/asia/09pstan.php |date=12 September 2008 }} most of the people killed in these attacks are civilians., ''International Herald Tribune'', 9 September.

On 25 September 2008, the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistan military]] and the [[United States military|US military]] became involved in heavy [[Pakistan–United States skirmishes|border fighting]] on the [[Durand Line|Frontier border]]. The incident happened after two US military helicopters came under fire from Pakistan army troops. A US military spokesman insisted that they had been about a mile and a half inside [[Afghanistan]]. Speaking at the United Nations, [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Asif Ali Zardari|Asif Zardari]] maintained that Pakistan would not tolerate violations of its sovereignty, even by its allies. President Zardari told the United Nations, "Just as we will not let Pakistani's territory to be used by terrorists for attacks against our people and our neighbours, we cannot allow our territory and our sovereignty to be violated by our friends", he said, without specifically citing the United States or the border flareup.&lt;ref name="google2" /&gt;

===Militants targeting of tribes===

On 10 October 2008, TTP militants beheaded four kidnapped pro-government tribal elders in the Charmang area of Bajaur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gPevBKLIKB_Sph1HS5oMlCCzlAbA |title=AFP: Taliban militants behead four in Pakistan: officials |publisher=Google |date=11 October 2008 |accessdate=19 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708135114/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gPevBKLIKB_Sph1HS5oMlCCzlAbA |archivedate=8 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2008/10/11/top16.htm |title=Four pro-govt tribal elders beheaded -DAWN – Top Stories; October 11, 2008 |publisher=Dawn.com |accessdate=19 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017101305/http://www.dawn.com/2008/10/11/top16.htm |archivedate=17 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 2008, a suicide bomber struck an anti-militant gathering of tribal elders just as they had decided to form a lashkar (tribal militia). At least 110 anti-Taliban tribesmen were killed and a further 125 were wounded. The suicide bomber drove his car into the gathering itself and blew himself up. The attack on the tribal council took place in Orakzai, normally a relatively quiet corner of the nation's chaotic tribal areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7663574.stm |title=Dozens killed in Pakistan bombing |publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 October 2008 | date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171011115928/https://www.thenews.com.pk/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighting for the NATO supply lines===
{{Main|NATO supply lines to Afghanistan|Northern Distribution Network}}
[[File:F-16 Red Flag 2010 Pakistan Air Force 9 sqn Griffins.jpg|thumb|The [[Pakistan Air Force]]'s F-16s took active participation in the combat aerial bombing missions against the [[Pakistan Taliban|TTP]] hideouts. Most [[Pakistan Air Force]] combat air operations were conducted at night.]]

On 19 October 2008, the [[News channels in Pakistan|news media]] began to broadcast the news of Pakistan Army troops, led by an army lieutenant, being locked in a fierce battle with foreign militants to keep open the [[NATO supply lines to Afghanistan|line routes]] to [[NATO invasion of Afghanistan|NATO forces]] in Afghanistan. For several months, the foreign militants had been trying to either attack or seal off the supply routes. The army battle reports indicated that the local commander, Mohammad Tariq al-Fridi, had seized terrain around the mile-long [[Kohat Tunnel]]. The [[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|military intelligence reports]] had held al-Fridi responsible for coordinated suicide bomb attacks and rocket strikes against convoys emerging from it. The [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]] spokesman, [[Maulvi Omar]], claimed that his foreign fighters would lay down their arms if the Pakistan Army ceased intense fighting. The military refused his offers and a tactical military operation was launched to secure the [[Kohat Tunnel|tunnel routes]] after [[Tehrik-i-Taliban|TTP]] seized five trucks carrying weapons and ammunition. They held the tunnel for a week before they were driven out in fierce fighting with the military. Since then, Tariq and his men have returned several times to attack convoys, in a response, the army launched its latest onslaught after a suicide bomb attack at one of its bases near the tunnel six weeks ago. In a massive [[Manhunt (military)|manhunt operation]], Tariq was killed along with hundreds of militants while trying to flee the battle in a combat air operation. The operation ended with five civilians were killed and 45 were injured, including 35 soldiers, when a pickup truck packed with explosives was driven into a checkpoint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100417232405/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4969024.ece ]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 2008, another group of militants attacked two convoys at the Khyber Pass capturing 13 trucks which were headed for Afghanistan. One convoy was from the [[United Nations World Food Programme]] and was carrying wheat. The second was intended for NATO troops and one of the captured trucks was carrying with it two U.S. military Humvees, which were also seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/pakistan.convoy.attack/index.html |title=Militants grab U.S. military Humvees in ambush |publisher=CNN |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2008, the militants torched more than 160 vehicles destined for US-led troops in Afghanistan. The militants attacked the Portward Logistic Terminal (PTL) in the northern city of Peshawar at around 02:30&amp;nbsp;am, destroying its gate with a rocket-propelled grenade and shooting dead a guard. They then set fire to about 100 vehicles, including 70 Humvees, which shipping documents showed were being shipped to the US-led coalition forces and the [[Afghan National Army]]. At the same time, militants torched about 60 more vehicles at the nearby Faisal depot, which like Portward is on the ring road around Peshawar, where convoys typically stop before heading for the Khyber Pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5303861.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&amp;attr=797093 |accessdate=2 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814042031/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5303861.ece |title=US and Nato Humvees destroyed as Islamists attack Afghan supply bases |archivedate=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 2009, the militant group again blew up a bridge at the Khyber Pass, temporarily cutting a major supply line for Western troops in Afghanistan. After the attack supplies along the route had been halted "for the time being", according to NATO.

==Public support and unified military operations==

===Swat ceasefire===
{{Main|Nizam-e-Adl Regulation 2009}}
[[File:Pakistan Air Force Lockheed C-130E Hercules (L-382) Asuspine-2.jpg|thumb|Pakistan's airborne troops performed combat [[HALO HAHO|jump operations]] from [[Pakistan Air Force]]'s [[C-130 Hercules]] aircraft, 2010.]]

Since 2008–09, the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman joint chiefs]] [[General Tariq Majid]], working with his [[JS HQ (Pakistan)|JS HQ]] staffers, had been running several meetings of planning to conduct the joint warfare operations against the TTP militants. A new strategy of joint-military operations and studies were conducted under General Majid. During this time, the [[Government of Pakistan|Government]] agreed to impose the [[Nizam-e-Adl Regulation 2009|''Sharia ordnance'']] law and temporarily suspended the military suspension in the [[Swat Valley]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province]]. This decision was troubling for the United States in Afghanistan, which believed that it would embolden militant groups fighting [[United States military|US military]]–led [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] in Afghanistan.

The US government also believed it would provide another safe haven for the militants within {{convert|80|mi|km}} of Islamabad, as well as a corridor between the [[Pakistan–Afghanistan border|North-Western border]] with [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan-India border|North–Eastern border]] with India.

The [[Pakistan Government]] officials rationalized that "such agreement was the only way to pacify a fierce insurgency and avoid more civilian casualties in [[Swat Valley]] – whose ski resort and mountain scenery once made it a popular tourist destination. The [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]'s [[Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Chief Minister]], [[Amir Haider Khan Hoti|Amir Hoti]], announced that the local authorities would impose Islamic law across [[Malakand Division]], which includes Swat. The Government officials maintained that [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Asif Ali Zardari|Asif Zardari]] would sign off on the deal once peace had been restored. However, the agreement was never signed by President Zardari soon after the TTP militants violated the treaty.

The agreement came the day after the militants in Swat said that it would observe a ten-day ceasefire in support of the peace process. Pakistani officials say that the laws allow Muslim clerics to advise judges, but not to outlaw female education, music or other activities once banned by the Afghan Taliban in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100417232354/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5745194.ece ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeat of the militants in Bajaur===

On 1 March 2009, the Pakistan Army troops finally defeated the foreign fighters in Bajaur, which is a strategically important region on the Afghan border. The 40th Army Division commander, [[Major-General]] [[Tariq Khan (general)|Tariq Khan]] reported that the army and the [[Frontier Corps]] had killed most militants in Bajaur, the smallest of the agencies but a major infiltration route into Afghanistan, after a six-month offensive. By the time the battle in Bajaur was over, the Pakistan Army killed over 1,500 militants while losing 97 of their own soldiers and 404 soldiers seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/troops-defeat-taliban-in-pakistans-bajaur-region/429310 |title=Troops defeat Taliban in Pakistan's Bajaur region |work=The Indian Express  |date=1 March 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation on 30 March, the militant groups [[2009 Lahore police academy attacks|attacked]] the [[Lahore police academy attack|Police Academy]] in Munawan town, killing and taking hostage police cadets. In an operation led by [[Punjab Police (Pakistan)|Punjab Police]], the units of [[Elite Police]] had managed to retake the academy. Lasting about eight hours, the police suspension ended with 18 people killed in the attack, including eight policemen, eight militants and two civilians deaths. At least, ~95 policemen were wounded and four gunmen were captured by the [[Elite Police]].

In a similar attack on 4 April 2009, another suicide bomber attacked a military camp in Islamabad killing eight soldiers; less than 24 hours later, two more suicide attacks occurred. One bomber targeted a market on the border with Afghanistan killing 17 people and the other attacked a mosque in Chakwal, in the [[Eastern Pakistan]] province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], killing 26 more civilians. The next day, the leader of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, Baitullah Mehsud, promised that there were to be two suicide attacks per week in the country until the Pakistani army withdrew from the border region and the United States stopped its missile attacks by unmanned drones on militant bases.

In March 2009, many Pakistanis were horrified when a videotape was broadcast in [[News channels in Pakistan|news channels]] that showed militant enforcers were publicly whipping a 17-year-old girl in Swat accused of having an affair. The girl had not committed [[fornication]] or adultery but was flogged simply because she refused her brother's demand to marry someone of his choosing. Protests against the TTP broke out all over the country to demonstrate against the flogging. Conservative thinker [[Raja Zafar ul Haq]] of [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Pakistan Muslim League]], appearing in [[News channels in Pakistan|news channels]], maintained that "this summary punishment of flogging simply for refusing a marriage proposal was totally ''un-Islamic'' and had nothing to do with ''Sharia''." He went on to say that [[Muhammad]] had strictly forbidden the practice of forced marriages and in this case, the girl had not done anything wrong by refusing a marriage proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://helpthemiddleclass.com/2009/05/10/taliban-invasion-is-about-power-not-islam-in-pakistan/ |title=Taliban Invasion Is About Power, Not Islam in Pakistan |publisher=Help The Middle Class |date=10 May 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711162323/http://helpthemiddleclass.com/2009/05/10/taliban-invasion-is-about-power-not-islam-in-pakistan/ |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensing the sensitivity of the issue, the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] of Pakistan appointed a five-member team appointed to investigate the video's origins, and concluded that it had been faked, raising questions at [[Pakistani intelligence services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearynews.com/english/newsdetail.asp?nid=45747|title=Video of Swat girl flogging was fake: report,2/25/2011 6:10:35 AM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=thearynews.com|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/swat-girl-flogging-video-fake-pak-probe-t/448781/ |title=Swat girl flogging video 'fake': Pak probe team |work=The Indian Express  |date=19 April 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buner, the TTP continued their criminal activities when residents said TTP fighters had been stealing cattle for meat, stealing other livestock, berating men without beards and recruiting teenagers into their ranks. The TTP also began to steal vehicles belonging to government officials and ransacked the offices of some local non-government organisations for no apparent reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6168940.ece |accessdate=19 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510010417/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6168940.ece |title=‘Stop the Taliban now – or we will’ |archivedate=10 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 12 schoolchildren were killed by a bomb contained in a football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Football-Bomb-Kills-12-Children-In-Northern-Pakistan-While-Another-Four-Die-As-Grenade-Explodes/Article/200904415269416?lpos=World_News_Article_Related_Content_Region_10&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15269416_Football_Bomb_Kills_12_Children_In_Northern_Pakistan_While_Another_Four_Die_As_Grenade_Explodes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711184155/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Football-Bomb-Kills-12-Children-In-Northern-Pakistan-While-Another-Four-Die-As-Grenade-Explodes/Article/200904415269416?lpos=World_News_Article_Related_Content_Region_10&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15269416_Football_Bomb_Kills_12_Children_In_Northern_Pakistan_While_Another_Four_Die_As_Grenade_Explodes |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 July 2012 |title=Football Bomb Kills 12 Children in Northern Pakistan While Another Four Die As Grenade Explodes |publisher=News.sky.com |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Black Thunderstorm===
{{Main|Second Battle of Swat}}
[[File:Pakistani military at Baine Baba Ziarat - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|Pakistan airborne forces observing the Swat Valley at its highest point after defeating the Taliban, 2009.]]

On 26 April 2009, the unified [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] started the strategic and tactical airborne attack, codename [[Operation Black Thunderstorm|''Black Thunderstorm'']], with the aim of retaking Buner, Lower Dir, Swat and Shangla districts from the [[Pakistani Taliban|TTP]]. This joint [[Pakistan Army|army]]&amp;ndash;[[Pakistan Navy|navy]]- [[Pakistan Air Force|air force]] unified operation was well rehearsed and prepared. The fighter jets of Navy and air force began pounding the militant hideouts while army kept advancing in the militant hideouts. The combat fighter pilots of the navy and air force flew their aerial bombing mission together in high altitude at continuous 24-hour period, to avoid being hit from the anti-aircraft guns. During the initial stages of the unified operations, the ground troops and paratroopers performed combat [[HALO/HAHO]] techniques to hold the control of high strategic mountains and hills surrounding the Taliban-controlled cities.

The operation largely cleared the Lower Dir district of militia forces by 28 April and Buner by 5 May 2009. The same day, the ground fighting in Swat was particularly fierce since the [[Pakistani Taliban|TTP]] threw away their insurgent tactics and the ground forces obtained the [[counter-insurgency]] tactics. By 14&amp;nbsp;May 2009, the military was only six kilometers south of Mingora, the militia-held capital city of Swat, and preparations for all-out street fighting were underway.

On 23 May 2009, the battle for Mingora started and by 27 May, approximately 70% of the city was cleared of militants. On 30&amp;nbsp;May, the Pakistan military had taken back the city of Mingora from the [[Pakistani Taliban|TTP]], calling it a significant victory in its offensive against the militants. However, some sporadic fighting was still continuing on the city's outskirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=From Reza Sayah CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/30/pakistan.mingora/index.html |title=Pakistan secures key Swat Valley city |publisher=CNN |date= 30 May 2009|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8075136.stm |title=South Asia &amp;#124; Pakistan army 'regains' Swat city |work=BBC News |date=30 May 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, according to the military, 128 soldiers and more than ~1,475 militants were killed and 317 soldiers were wounded during operation ''Black Thunderstorm''. ~95 soldiers and policemen were captured by the militants; all were rescued by the military. 114 foreign fighters were captured, including some local commanders. At least 23 of the militants killed were foreigners.

Sporadic fighting throughout Swat continued up until mid-June. On 14 June, the operation was declared over and the military had regained control of the region. Only small pockets of Taliban resistance remained and the military started mopping up operations. This led to a [[2009 refugee crisis in Pakistan|refugee crisis]], and by 22 August, 1.6 million of 2.3 million have returned home according to UN estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-08-22/pakistan/28191405_1_refugees-return-home |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728145518/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-08-22/pakistan/28191405_1_refugees-return-home |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 July 2012 |title=1.6 million Pakistani refugees return home: UN – Times Of India |work=The Times of India |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?a=jitoubcchjh&amp;title=1.3_million_displaced_Pakistanis_return_home:_UN |title=1.3 million displaced Pakistanis return home: UN |publisher=Sify.com |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blockade of South Waziristan===
{{Main|Operation Rah-e-Nijat}}

[[File:Camp in Waziristan 1938.jpg|thumb|left|A vintage photo of South Wazristan's mountains, primary hideouts of TTP before being pushed to Eastern [[Afghanistan]] by the [[Pakistan Military|military]] in 2009.]]

In the aftermath of the successful victory and recapture of the entire [[Swat valley]], the [[Pakistan military]] began a massive army troop build-up along the southern and eastern borders of [[South Waziristan]] on 16 June 2009,. The military was now taking the fight to Mehsud's mountainous stronghold, ordering an expansion of its current offensive against [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP fighters]] in the Swat valley. On 17 June 2009, the [[Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Governor]] of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], Owais Ghani, denounced [[Baitullah Mehsud]] as "the root cause of all evils", and quoted that the government has called on the military to launch a "full-fledged" operation to eliminate Mehsud and his estimated 20,000 men.

The Islamabad's decision to launch the offensive against [[Baitullah Mehsud|Mehsud]] signaled a deepening of Pakistani resolve against the militants. The military had targeted the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]] leader on three separate occasions – in 2004, 2005 and 2008 – but walked away each time after signing peace deals with Mehsud. This time, the military also enjoyed the public support as a wave of terrorist attacks had swayed public sentiment against the Taliban.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Waraich |first=Omar |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1904905,00.html |title=Pakistan's Next Fight?

On 17 October 2009, the military launched another offense, called [[Operation Rah-e-Nijat|''Rah-e-Nijat'']] when the combat brigades and fighter jets launched a large-scale offensive in South Waziristan involving ~28,000 troops advancing across South Waziristan from three directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan forces move on Taliban |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8311927.stm|agency=BBC News|date=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with air force strike and naval intelligence assessment on the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]], the first town to fall to the military was Kotkai, the birthplace of the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]] leader, [[Hakimullah Mehsud]], on 19 October 2009. However, the next day, the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]] re-took the town. Troops had thrust into Kotkai only to be hit by a determined counteroffensive that killed seven soldiers, including an army major, and wounded seven more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/world/story/77472.html# |title=Taliban retake town as Pakistan offensive runs into trouble &amp;#124; McClatchy |publisher=Mcclatchydc.com |accessdate=27 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022064301/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/world/story/77472.html |archivedate=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The military managed to take the town once again on 24 October, after days of bombardments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8323660.stm |title=South Asia &amp;#124; Pakistan 'takes key Taliban town' |work=BBC News |date=24 October 2009 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Baitullah Mehsud and TTP counter-attacks===

As early as August 2009, the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]] leader, [[Baitullah Mehsud]], was killed in [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|a drone attack]]. This was later confirmed by captured chief spokesman [[Maulvi Umar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/04-tehrik-i-taliban-spokesman-mohmand-qs-01 Search Results tehrik i taliban spokesman mohmand qs | Latest news, Breaking news, Pakistan News, World news, business, sport and multimedia | DAWN.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820062913/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/04-tehrik-i-taliban-spokesman-mohmand-qs-01 |date=20 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Hakimullah Mehsud]].

In early October 2009, the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]] started a string of bomb attacks in cities across Pakistan.

As late as 2010, [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|chief of naval staff]] [[Admiral]] [[Noman Bashir]] had coordinated many of successful tactical ground operations against TTP hideouts, to support the army and air force pressure on militants. Many successful operations were executed by the navy, and its operational capability gained international prominence.&lt;ref name="GEO TV"&gt;{{cite news|last=GEO Pakistan |title=War on terror will continue: PM |url=http://www.geo.tv/5-24-2011/81735.htm |accessdate=9 March 2013 |newspaper=GEO TV |date=24 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806011743/http://www.geo.tv/5-24-2011/81735.htm |archivedate=6 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, Pakistan's armed forces were stretched thin by natural disasters and deployments against extremist groups, with one third of the army deployed for the fight, another third along the Indian border and the rest engaged in preparing to deploy.&lt;ref&gt;Garamone, Jim.

The groups affiliated with the armed TTP vowed, via media, to avenge Osama's death upon the Pakistan Armed Forces.

On 21 and 28 April, senior al-Qaeda operative [[Ilyas Kashmiri]] conducted a series of coordinated terrorist attacks on the [[Pakistan Navy]] presence in [[Northern Pakistan|Northern]] and [[Southern Pakistan|Southern contingents]]. This included attacks on high naval officials of the Pakistan Navy in Karachi, first attacking their bus near the Navy bases. Finally on 22 May, TTP attacked the [[PNS Mehran|Mehran Naval Base]], killing up to 10 naval officers, wounding 30 others, and destroying two naval reconnaissance aircraft, during the attack. In response, the navy's [[Special Service Group Navy|SSG(N)]] launched its largest offensive efforts since the [[Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971|1971 operations]], and managed to control and secure the base after a massive shootout. Operationally resulting in tactical success, the navy's counter offensive killed all the militants and ring leaders behind these operations. Kashmiri was widely suspected in the Mehran operation.  On 4 June 2011, [[Ilyas Kashmiri]] was killed by a U.S. drone strike in [[South Waziristan]].

In 2012, the north-west region of Pakistan experienced periodic bombings perpetrated by insurgents, resulting in thousands of deaths.

==Issues with War Veterans==
Pakistan does not have its own equivalent to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]. There is also no federal ministry that looks after veteran affairs. Most of Pakistan's infantry come from lower income, poor families, mainly from the rural areas of the country. They remain unknown from the time of their recruitment, and for the most part, to the time of their leave or death. Because there is no network of support that goes out to veterans, some believe that Pakistan's veterans are facing similar issues like those faced by [[Vietnam veteran]]s. Politicians hardly ever mention the veterans in speeches or statements. This is because civil society hardly ever inquires or hears about the physical and mental challenges facing Pakistan's veterans. How to re-integrate veterans in to society is an issue that has yet to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/7920/foot-soldiers-our-forgotten-war-veterans/|title=Foot soldiers: Our forgotten war veterans|work=tribune.com.pk|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the success of unified military operations in 2009–11, the Waziristan war has been heavily featured in [[Media of Pakistan|Pakistan media]], including in [[Theatre of Pakistan|theatre]], [[Television in Pakistan|television]], [[Cinema of Pakistan|cinema]], [[Music of Pakistan|music]], video games and literature. The war also influenced Pakistan's civil society to gather their support for Pakistan Armed Forces through the media miniseries and films that were released throughout the war. Pakistan's rock bands, such as ''[[Entity Paradigm]]'', [[Strings (band)|''Strings'']], [[Call (band)|''Call'']] and ''[[Mizraab]]'' released many patriotic songs to gather support for the Pakistan armed forces to tackle down the insurgency. A popular band in the country, [[Junoon (band)|Junoon]], released their album, ''[[Rock &amp; Roll Jihad]]'' and literature ''[[Rock &amp; Roll Jihad: A Muslim Rock Star's Revolution]]'' in 2010.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Studies and research conducted by Pakistan's leading economists and the financial experts, the war hit Pakistan's national economy "very hard", and the outcomes produced by the war on country's national economy, were surprising and unexpected to Pakistan's military and economic planners.&lt;ref name="Central Asia Online"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sohail Ahmed|title=Pakistan's economy hit hard by war on terro|url=http://centralasiaonline.com/en_GB/articles/caii/features/pakistan/2010/06/18/feature-01|publisher=Central Asia Online|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakistani government's economic institutions referred to the conflict as "economic terrorism" and according to Pakistani officials, the indirect and direct cost of the war was around $2.67&amp;nbsp;billion in 2001–02, which reached up to $13.6 billion by 2009–10, was projected to rise to $17.8 billion in the 2010–11 financial year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry of Finance|title=Cost of War on Terror for Pakistan Economy|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:6pbRyrLvGUwJ:www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapter_11/Special%2520Section_1.pdf+Pakistan+and+Economic+terror&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShmNeXw3b_kZa9btb8ynmF9OmtxDJk-3hPQSGtFyTN8ne1CfKtLv9lvzLYNA_KWjMXalNLRUCrEpR9oghYv5x-DdBPGXVrngVmHfeJLbXHcFz75UmtnKH2T3ehuo3c98GgdmfGw&amp;sig=AHIEtbTjhUwue7Ox9nBkPN8VlbJwThHqOQ|work=Economic Affairs Secretariat|publisher=Government of Pakistan (Public Domain)|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's national investment-to-GDP ratio has nosedived from 22.5% in 2006–07 which went down to 13.4% in 2010–11 with serious consequences for job creating ability of the economy.&lt;ref name="Government of Pakistan (Public Domain)"/&gt; The leading English language newspaper, [[The Nation (Pakistan)|''The Nation'']] gave great criticism to United States, and called U.S. role as "economic terrorism" in South Asia.&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hali|first=S.M|title=Economic Terrorism|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/columns/07-Mar-2012/economic-terrorism|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=The Nation|date=7 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721015528/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/columns/07-Mar-2012/economic-terrorism|archive-date=21 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] pledged to continue supporting Pakistan and said that Pakistan would be provided economic aid of $1.5 billion each year for the next five years. Unfolding a new US strategy to defeat Taliban and al-Qaeda, Obama said Pakistan must be a 'stronger partner' in destroying al-Qaeda safe havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/blog/blog_details.asp?id=107 |title=Obama unveils new US policy for Pakistan, Afghanistan |accessdate=2 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401005358/http://thenews.com.pk/blog/blog_details.asp?id=107 |archivedate=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, President Obama has also planned to propose an extra $2.8 billion in aid for the Pakistani military to intensify the US-led 'War on Terror' along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The military aid would be in addition to the civilian aid of $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion a year for the next five years from 2009 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/south-asia/obama-to-propose-28-billion-dollars-military-aid-for-pakistan_100173583.html |title=Obama to propose 28 billion dollars military aid for Pakistan |publisher=Thaindian.com |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, President Musharraf wrote that the United States had paid millions of dollars to the Pakistan government as [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] money for capturing al-Qaeda operatives from tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. About 359 of them were handed over to the US for prosecution.&lt;ref name=1billion /&gt;
