The following list is of events that happened during '''2005 in [[Sierra Leone]]'''.
Sierra Leone, a country in West Africa, has a special significance in the history of the transatlantic slave trade as the departure point for thousands of west African captives. The capital, Freetown, was founded as a home for repatriated former slaves in 1787.
But the country's modern history has been overshadowed by a brutal civil war that ended in 2002 with the help of Britain, the former colonial power, and a large United Nations peacekeeping mission.
Sierra Leone has experienced substantial economic growth in recent years, although the ruinous effects of the civil war continue to be felt.
The country is also rich in diamonds and other minerals. The trade in illicit gems, known as "[[blood diamond]]s" for their role in funding conflicts, perpetuated the civil war. The government has sought to crack down on the trade.

*[[President of Sierra Leone|President]]: [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]]
*[[Vice-President of Sierra Leone|Vice-President]]: [[Solomon Ekuma Berewa]]
*[[Supreme Court of Sierra Leone|Chief Justice]]: [[Ade Renner Thomas]] (now Abdulai Hamid Charm)

&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1986, AfricaRice has been one of the 15 specialized research centers of [[CGIAR]].

The center runs regional research stations in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], [[Senegal]], in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]] and country offices in Cotonou, Benin and in Antananarivo, Madagascar.

AfricaRice aims to contribute to poverty alleviation and food security in Africa through research for development. The center has therefore close links to agricultural research organizations in the African member states, to agricultural universities and research institutes in Europe, Japan and the United States, and to the development sector, which include [[Non Governmental Organizations]], farmers organizations and donors. AfricaRice, being part of the CGIAR system, shares resources with several of the other CGIAR organizations, including the [[International Rice Research Institute]] (IRRI) in Los Baños, Philippines, and the [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture]] in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]]. In the course of reforms at the CGIAR, AfricaRice developed together with [[IRRI]] and [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]] (CIAT) the [[Global Rice Science Partnership]] (GRiSP), which sets a global strategic research agenda for rice.&lt;ref name=GRiSP&gt;[http://www.grisp.net/main/summary Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP)] GRiSP website&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major tasks of AfricaRice is the development and introduction of new rice seed varieties that are suitable for African conditions. NERICA, which stands for "[[New Rice for Africa]]", is two families of [[Interspecific competition|interspecific]] cultivars of African (''[[Oryza glaberrima]]'') and Asian (''[[Oryza sativa]]'') rice species, that was developed to improve the yields of African farmers. For his work on NERICA, Dr Monty Jones from Sierra Leone was awarded the [[World Food Prize]] in 2004&lt;ref name="monty jones"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first African to win this award.

The '''African Independence Movements''' took place in the 20th century, when a wave of struggles for independence in European-ruled African territories were witnessed.

Notable militant independence  movements took place:
*[[Algeria]] (former [[French Algeria]]), see [[Algerian War]]
*[[Angola]] (former [[Portuguese Angola]]), see [[Portuguese Colonial War]]
*[[Guinea-Bissau]] (former [[Portuguese Guinea]]), see [[Portuguese Colonial War]]
*[[Kenya]] (former [[British Kenya]]), see [[Mau Mau Uprising]]
*[[Madagascar]] (see [[Malagasy Uprising]])
*[[Mozambique]] (former [[Portuguese Mozambique]]), see [[Portuguese Colonial War]]
*[[Namibia]] (former [[South West Africa]]) – against [[South Africa]], see [[Namibian War of Independence]] and [[South African Border War]]
*[[Zimbabwe]] (former [[Rhodesia]]) – see [[Rhodesian Bush War]]

For a list of African nations achieving independence, see [[Decolonisation of Africa]].

==British overseas territories==
===British Kenya===
{{Main|Mau Mau Uprising|British Kenya}}
British-ruled Kenya was the place of a rebellion from 1952 to 1960, an [[insurgency]] by [[Kenya]]n rebels against the British [[Colonialism|colonialist]] rule.  The core of the rebellion was formed by members of the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] [[ethnic group]], along with smaller numbers of [[Embu people|Embu]] and [[Ameru|Meru]].

==French overseas territories==
===French Algeria===
{{Main|Algerian War|French Algeria}}
Many Algerians had fought as French soldiers during the First World War. Thus [[Muslim]] Algerians felt all the more unfair that their votes were not equal to the other Algerians especially after 1947 when the Algerian Assembly was created. This assembly was composed of 120 members. Muslim Algerians who represented about 9 million people could designate 50% of the Assembly members while 900,000 non-Muslim Algerians could designate the other half. Moreover, a massacre occurred in [[Sétif]] May 8, 1945. It opposed Algerians who were demonstrating for their national claim to the [[French Army]]. After skirmishes with police, Algerians killed about 100 ethnic French. The French army retaliated harshly. Thousands of Algerians probably died. It triggered a radicalisation of Algerian nationalists and it can be considered the beginning of the [[Algerian War]].

In 1956, about 512,001 French soldiers were in Algeria. No resolution was imaginable in the short term. An overwhelming majority of French politicians were opposed to the idea of independence while independence was gaining ground in Muslim Algerians' mind. France was mired and the Fourth Republic collapsed on this issue. In 1958, [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s return to power was supposed to bring back Algeria in the bosom of France as thought French generals in Algeria. But pragmatism impelled De Gaulle to consent independence in 1962 after an aborted military coup in Algeria.

==Portuguese overseas territories==
{{See also|History of Portugal|Economic history of Portugal|Portuguese Colonial War}}
Portugal built a five-century-long [[Portuguese Empire|global empire]]. Portuguese overseas expansion began in the 15th century, thanks to several factors that gave the small coastal nation an advantage over its larger European neighbours. First, in the 14th century, Portuguese shipbuilders invented several new techniques that made sailing in the stormy Atlantic Ocean more practical. They combined elements of different types of ships to construct stronger, roomier and more manoeuvrable [[caravel]]s. They also took advantage of more reliable compasses for [[navigation]], and benefited from the school for navigation created by [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] (1394–1460) at [[Sagres, Portugal|Sagres]] in 1419. Starting with voyages to [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]] (islands in the Atlantic) in the first part of the 14th century, the Portuguese systematically extended their explorations as far as Japan by the 16th century. In the process, they established forts and settlements along the West and East African coasts. In the 16th through 18th centuries, the Portuguese lost their lead to other European nations, notably England and France, but played a major role in the slave trade to satisfy the demand for labour in [[Brazil]] and other American markets. By the beginning of the 19th century, Portugal controlled outposts at six locations in Africa. One was the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, located about 700 miles due west of [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]. Claimed for Portugal by [[Diogo Gomes]] about 1458, this archipelago of eight major islands was devoted to sugar cultivation using slaves taken from the African mainland. The Portuguese once had extensive claims on the West African coast—since they were the first Europeans to explore it systematically—but by 1800 they were left with only a few ports at the mouth of the Rio Geba in what is now known as the [[Guinea-Bissau]]. To the east, the Portuguese controlled the islands of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], located south of the mouth of the Niger River. Like the Cape Verde Islands, they were converted to sugar production in the early 16th century using slaves acquired on the mainland in the vicinity of the Congo River. By the end of the 19th century, Portuguese landowners had successfully introduced [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] production using forced African labour. Further south, the Portuguese claimed both sides of the mouth of the Congo River, as well as the Atlantic coast as far south as the Rio Cunene. In practical terms, Portugal controlled port cities like those of [[Cabinda (city)|Cabinda]] (north of the Congo River mouth), [[Ambriz]] (south of the Congo's mouth), [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]] (on the Angolan coast) plus some river towns in the Angolan interior.

The last area claimed by Portugal in Africa was along the southeast coast on either side of the mouth of the Zambezi River. After reaching this area, known as the Swahili Coast, at the end of the 15th century, the Portuguese came to dominate most of it by the end of the 16th century. During the 17th century, they lost control of everything north of [[Cape Delgado]] to [[Arabs]] from [[Oman]] (who established the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]]), leaving them with major ports at [[Mozambique]], [[Quelimane]], and [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]], plus settlements along the Zambezi and other rivers.

Despite these holdings, the Portuguese hold in Africa was problematic. The first cause was the small size of Portugal's population, coupled with the lack of popular support for overseas empire. Exploration and conquest began as an enterprise supported by the nobility, and Portuguese peasants rarely participated unless forced to do so. When the common people of Portugal did chose to emigrate, they were much more likely to head to Brazil and other territories than to Africa. To induce Europeans to move to its African holdings, the Portuguese government resorted to releasing ''degradados''—convicted criminals—from prison in exchange for accepting what amounted to exile in Africa. Angola, in particular, gained a reputation as a Portuguese penal colony. Also, since the European population remained almost entirely male, the Portuguese birth rate was negligible, although plenty of "Afro-Lusitanians" were born to African mothers. As a result, the European population of Portugal's African settlements was never very large, and community leaders were just as likely to owe their loyalty to local African governments as they did to the distant Portuguese government.

A second cause of weakness in Portuguese Africa was the effects of three centuries of [[Atlantic slave trade]] which had roots in the older [[African slave trade]]. Once the Atlantic triangular trade got underway, many Portuguese (including many Brazilian traders) in Africa found little incentive to engage in any other kind of profitable economic activity. The economies of Guinea, Angola and Mozambique became almost entirely devoted to the export of slaves to the [[New World]] (plus gold and ivory where they were available) while on the islands, slaves were used to grow sugar for export. Colonial authorities did nothing to stop the slave trade, which had sympathisers even among the several native African tribes, and many became wealthy by supporting it, while the traders themselves generated huge profits with which they secured allies in Africa and Portugal.

Although anti-slavery efforts became organised in Europe in the 18th century, the slave trade only came to an end in the early 19th century, thanks in large part to English efforts to block shipping to the French during the Napoleonic Wars. Portugal was one of the first countries in the world to outlaw slavery, and did it so in [[mainland Portugal]] during the 18th century. The Portuguese government ended colonial slavery in stages with a final decree in 1858 that outlawed slavery in the overseas empire. The gradual pace of abolition was due to the strength of pro-slavery forces in Portuguese politics, Brazil and in Africa, they interfered with colonial administrators who challenged long-established and powerful commercial interests.

The [[Napoleonic Wars]] added a new force to the Portuguese political scene—republicanism—introduced as an alternative to the monarchy by French troops in 1807. The French invasion induced the Portuguese royal family to make the controversial decision to flee to Brazil (on English ships), from where they ruled until 1821. By the time King [[João VI]] returned to Lisbon, he faced a nobility divided in their support for him personally, plus a middle class that wanted a constitutional monarchy. During Joao VI's reign (1821–1826) and that of his successors—Peter IV (1826–1831), Maria (1833–1853), Peter V (1853–1861), Louis I (1861–1889), and Carlos (1889–1908)—there was a civil war that lasted from 1826 to 1834, a long period characterised by what one author called "ministerial instability and chronic insurrection" from 1834 to 1853, and finally the end of the monarchy when both Carlos and his heir were assassinated on February 1, 1908. Under those circumstances, colonial officials appointed by governments in Lisbon were more concerned with politics at home than with administering their African territories.

As it did everywhere else, the [[Industrial Revolution]] stimulated change in [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Africa]]. It created a demand for tropical raw materials like [[vegetable oil]]s, [[cotton]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[rubber]], and it also created a need for markets to purchase the expanded quantity of goods issuing from factories. In Portugal's case, most of the factories were located in England, which had had a special relationship with Portugal ever since [[Philippa]], the daughter of England's [[John of Gaunt]], married John of Avis, the founder of the Portuguese second dynasty. Prodded by Napoleon's invasion and English support for the royal family's escape to Brazil, King João and his successors eliminated tariffs, ended trade monopolies and generally opened the way for British merchants to become dominant in the Portuguese empire. At times, that caused friction, such as when both British and Portuguese explorers claimed the [[Shire Highlands]] (located in modern [[Malawi]]), but for the most part Great Britain supported the Portuguese position in exchange for incorporating Portugal's holdings into the British economic sphere.

With neither a large European population nor African wage earners, the Portuguese colonies offered poor markets for manufactured goods from the private sector. Consequently, industrialisation arrived in the form of government programs designed to improve internal communications and increase the number of European settlers. During the late 1830s, the government headed by Marquis [[Bernardo de Sá Nogueira de Figueiredo, 1st Marquess of Sá da Bandeira|Sá da Bandeira]] tried to encourage Portuguese farmers to migrate to Angola, with little success. Between 1845 and 1900, the European population of Angola rose from 1,832 to only about 9,000. European migration to Mozambique showed slightly better results—about 11,000 in 1911—but many were British from South Africa rather than Portuguese. The other major force for change was the rivalries that developed between European nations in the century between the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the outbreak of World War I. Forbidden from fighting each other by the "balance of power" established by the [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]], they competed in other ways including scientific discoveries, athletic competitions, exploration and proxy wars. Although not a major power anymore, Portugal participated in the competition, especially by sending out explorers to solidify their claim to all of the land between Angola and Mozambique. That bought them into conflict with men like [[Cecil Rhodes]], whose own vision of an empire from "Cape to Cairo" required that the British gain control over the same land (see [[British Ultimatum]]).

European rivalries appeared most often as commercial competition, and in 19th century Africa, that included the right to move goods by steamboat along rivers. The British had a head start thanks to their early adoption of steam technology and their supremacy on the high seas. They became the strongest proponents of the principle of "[[free trade]]" which prohibited countries from creating legal barriers to another country's merchants. Occasionally, Portuguese leaders resisted, but the British alliance provided sufficient benefits to convince various administrations to go along (although they faced revolts at home and in their colonies).

It was Portugal's claim to the land on either side of the mouth of the Congo River that triggered the events leading up to the [[Congress of Berlin]]. That claim, which dated from [[Diogo Cão]]'s voyage in 1484, gave Portugal places from which naval patrols could control access to Africa's largest river system. The British eyed this arrangement with suspicion for years, but paid tariffs (like everyone else) for the right to trade there, mostly for slaves.

After the abolition of slavery got underway, the Portuguese dragged their heels, so in 1839 the British government declared its right to inspect Portuguese ships for evidence of slave trading with or without Portuguese consent. That stirred the Portuguese to action, and in a subsequent series of agreements made in the 1840s, the British acquired the right to land their ships to land where no Portuguese authorities were present. When the Portuguese refused to renew the agreement in 1853, the British ceased paying tariffs at the ports on either side of the Congo River mouth, claiming that Portugal's claim had expired because they had left the area unoccupied for too long. Portugal reoccupied the ports of Cabinda and Ambriz in 1855, and relations with Great Britain improved after that. The dispute set a precedent, however, that effective occupation was a prerequisite for recognition of colonial claims. The question continued to reappear until 1885 when it was enshrined in the agreements that emanated from the Congress of Berlin.

The final straw was the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty signed on February 26, 1884. It granted exclusive navigation rights on the Congo River to Britain in exchange for British guarantees of Portugal's control of the coast at the mouth of the Congo River. Most significantly, it prevented the French from taking advantage of treaties signed by one of its explorers ([[Savorgnan de Brazza]]) with Africans living along the north side of the Congo River. International protests forced the two countries to abandon the treaty in June 1884, and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] used the controversy to call the Congress of Berlin later that year.

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to claim territory in sub-Saharan Africa, and their example inspired imitation from other European powers. For the British, the Portuguese were acceptable proxies in the competition with France, Russia and Germany for world domination. For Portuguese governments, the British alliance gave them influence that they could not command themselves, while the idea of a Portuguese empire offered something with which to distract domestic opponents from the struggles initiated by the Napoleonic Wars.

The issues that were raised by Portugal's claims in Africa and the efforts of other countries to whittle them down became the fundamental issues of the [[Congress of Berlin]]. In the end, the Congress settled more than the future of Portugal's African holdings—it also set the rules for any European government which wished to establish an empire in Africa.

In the 1950s, after World War II, several African territories became independent from their European rulers, but the oldest Europe-ruled territories, those ruled by Portugal, were rebranded "Overseas Provinces" from the former designation as Portuguese colonies. This was a firm effort of Portugal's authorities to preserve its old African possessions abroad and refuse any claims of independence.  This was followed by a wave of strong economic and social developments in all Portuguese Africa, in particular the overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]].

By the 1960s, several organisations were founded to support independence's claims of the Portuguese overseas provinces in Africa.  They were mostly entirely based and supported from outside Portugal's territories. Headquartered and managed in countries like [[Senegal]], [[Tanzania]], [[Algeria]], [[Guinea]] and [[Ethiopia]], these guerrilla movements sought weapons, financing and political support in [[Eastern Bloc]]'s communist states and the [[People's Republic of China]]. A [[Cold War]] conflict in Portuguese Africa was about to start. [[Marxist-Leninist]] and [[Maoist]] ideologies, backed by countries like the Soviet Union and People's Republic of [[China]] were behind the nationalist guerrilla movements created to attack Portuguese possessions and claim independence. The USA and other countries, in order to counter [[communist]] growing influence in the region also started to support some nationalist guerrillas in their fight against Portugal. The series of [[guerrilla]] wars involving Portugal and several armed nationalist groups from Africa in its overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]], and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], become known as the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (''Guerra Colonial'' or ''Guerra do Ultramar'').

===African nationalism in Portuguese Africa===
====Portuguese Angola====

{{Main|Angolan War of Independence|Portuguese West Africa}}

In [[Portuguese Angola]], the rebellion of the ZSN was taken up by the União das Populações de Angola (UPA),  which changed its name to the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) in 1962. On February 4, 1961, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]) took credit for the attack on the prison of Luanda, where seven policemen were killed. On March 15, 1961, the UPA, in a tribal attack, started the massacre of white populations and black workers born in other regions of Angola. This region would be retaken by large military operations that, however, would not stop the spread of the [[guerrilla]] actions to other regions of Angola, such as [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]], the east, the southeast and the central plateaus.

====Portuguese Guinea====

[[Image:PAIGC posto de controlo.jpg|thumb|right|PAIGC's checkpoint in 1974]]
In Portuguese Guinea, the [[Marxist]] [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) started fighting in January 1963.  Its [[guerrilla]] fighters attacked the Portuguese headquarters in [[Tite (Guinea-Bissau)|Tite]], located to the south of [[Bissau]], the capital, near the Corubal river . Similar actions quickly spread across the entire colony, requiring a strong response from the Portuguese forces.

The war in Guinea placed face to face [[Amílcar Cabral]], the leader of PAIGC, and [[António de Spínola]], the Portuguese general responsible for the local military operations. In 1965 the war spread to the eastern part of the country and in that same year the PAIGC carried out attacks in the north of the country where at the time only the minor guerrilla movement, the [[Frente de Luta pela Independência Nacional da Guiné]] (FLING), was fighting. By that time, the PAIGC started receiving military support from the [[Socialist Bloc]], mainly from [[Cuba]], a support that would last until the end of the war.

In Guinea the Portuguese troops mainly took a defensive position, limiting themselves to keeping the territories they already held. This kind of action was particularly devastating to the Portuguese troops who were constantly attacked by the forces of the PAIGC. They were also demoralised by the steady growth of the influence of the liberation supporters among the population that was being recruited in large numbers by the PAIGC.

With some strategic changes by António Spínola in the late 1960s, the Portuguese forces gained momentum and, taking the offensive, became a much more effective force. Between 1968 and 1972, the Portuguese forces took control of the situation and sometimes carried attacks against the PAIGC positions. At this time the Portuguese forces were also adopting subversive means to counter the insurgents, attacking the political structure of the nationalist movement.  This strategy culminated in the assassination of Amílcar Cabral in January 1973. Nonetheless, the PAIGC continued to fight back and pushed the Portuguese forces to the limit.   This became even more visible after PAIGC received [[anti-aircraft weapons]] provided by the Soviets, especially the [[SA-7]] rocket launchers, thus undermining the Portuguese air superiority.

====Portuguese Mozambique====

{{Main|Mozambican War of Independence|Portuguese East Africa}}
[[Portuguese Mozambique]] was the last territory to start the war of liberation.  Its nationalist movement was led by the [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[Liberation Front of Mozambique]] (FRELIMO), which carried out the first attack against Portuguese targets on September 24, 1964, in [[Chai, Mozambique|Chai]], province of [[Cabo Delgado Province|Cabo Delgado]].  The fighting later spread to [[Niassa]], [[Tete]] at the centre of the country. A report from Battalion No. 558 of the Portuguese army makes references to violent actions, also in Cabo Delgado, on August 21, 1964. On November 16 of the same year, the Portuguese troops suffered their first losses fighting in the north of the country, in the region of Xilama.  By this time, the size of the guerrilla movement had substantially increased; this, along with the low numbers of Portuguese troops and colonists, allowed a steady increase in FRELIMO's strength.  It quickly started moving south in the direction of Meponda and Mandimba, linking to Tete with the aid of [[Malawi]].

Until 1967 the FRELIMO showed less interest in Tete region, putting its efforts on the two northernmost districts of the country where the use of [[landmines]] became very common.  In the region of Niassa, FRELIMO's intention was to create a free corridor to Zambézia. Until April 1970, the military activity of FRELIMO increased steadily, mainly due to the strategic work of Samora Machel in the region of Cabo Delgado. In the early 1970s, after the Portuguese [[Gordian Knot Operation]], the nationalist guerrilla was severely damaged.

====Role of the Organisation of African Unity====
The [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) was founded May 1963. Its basic principles were co-operation between African nations and solidarity between African peoples. Another important objective of the OAU was an end to all forms of colonialism in Africa. This became the major objective of the organisation in its first years and soon OAU pressure led to the situation in the Portuguese colonies being brought up at the [[UN Security Council]].

The OAU established a committee based in [[Dar es Salaam]], with representatives from [[Ethiopia]], [[Algeria]], [[Uganda]], [[Egypt]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zaire]], [[Guinea]], [[Senegal]] and [[Nigeria]], to support African liberation movements. The support provided by the committee included military training and weapon supplies. The OAU also took action in order to promote the international acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE), composed of the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA). This support was transferred to the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]) and to its leader, [[Agostinho Neto]] in 1967. In November 1972, both movements were recognised by the OAU in order to promote their merger. After 1964, the OAU recognised PAIGC as the legitimate representatives of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde and in 1965 recognised [[FRELIMO]] for Mozambique.

==Eritrea==

[[Eritrea]] sits on a strategic location along the Red Sea, between the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]]. Eritrea was an Italian colony from 1890-1941. On April 1, 1941, the British captured [[Asmara]] defeating the Italians and Eritrea fell under the British Military Administration. This military rule lasted from 1941 until 1952. On December 2, 1950, the United Nations General Assembly, by UN Resolution 390 A(V) federated Eritrea with Ethiopia. The architect of this federal act was the United States. The federation went into effect September 11, 1952. However, the federation was a non-starter for feudal Ethiopia, and it started to systematically undermine it. On December 24, 1958—the Eritrean flag was replaced by the Ethiopian flag;
On May 17, 1960—The title "Government of Eritrea" of the Federation was changed to "Administration of Eritrea". Earlier [[Amharic]] was declared official language in Eritrea replacing [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] and [[Arabic]]. Finally on November 14, 1962 -– Ethiopia officially annexed Eritrea as its 14th province.

The people of Eritrea, after finding out peaceful resistance against Ethiopia's rule was falling on deaf ears formed the [[Eritrean Liberation Movement]] (ELM) which was formed in 1958. The founders of these independence movement were: Mohammad Said Nawud, Saleh Ahmed Iyay, Yasin al-Gade, Mohammad al-Hassen and Said Sabr. ELM members were organised in secret cells of seven. The movement was known as Mahber Shewate in Tigrinya and as Harakat Atahrir al Eritrea in Arabic. On July 10, 1960, a second independence movement, the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] (ELF) was founded in Cairo. Among its founders were: Idris Mohammed Adem, President, Osman Salih Sabbe, Secretary General, and Idris Glawdewos as head of military affairs. These were among those who made up the highest political body known as the Supreme Council. On September 1, 1961, Hamid Idris Awate and his ELF unit attacked an Ethiopian police unit in western Eritrea (near Mt. Adal). This heralded the 30-year Eritrean war for independence. Between March and November 1970, three core groups that later made up the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF) split from the ELF and established themselves as separate units.

In September 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown by a military coup in Ethiopia. The military committee that took power in Ethiopia is better known by its Amharic name the [[Derg]]. After the military coup the Derg broke ties with the U.S. and realigned itself with the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) and the USSR and its eastern bloc allies replaced America as patrons of Ethiopia's aggression against Eritrea. Between January and July 1977, the ELF and EPLF armies had liberated 95% of Eritrea capturing all but 4 towns. However, in 1978-79, Ethiopia mounted a series of five massive Soviet-backed offensives and reoccupied almost all of Eritrea's major towns and cities, except for Nakfa. The EPLF withdrew to a mountain base in northern Eritrea, around the town of [[Nakfa, Eritrea|Nakfa]]. In 1980 the EPLF had offered a proposal for referendum to end the war, however, Ethiopia, thinking it had a military upper hand, rejected the offer and war continued. In February–June 1982, The EPLF managed to repulse Ethiopia's much heralded four-month "Red Star" campaign (aka the 6th offensive by Eritreans) inflicting more than 31,000 Ethiopian casualties. In 1984 the EPLF started its counter-offensive and cleared the Ethiopian from the North-eastern Sahil front. In March 1988 the EPLF demolished the Ethiopian front at Afabet in a major offensive the British Historian [[Basil Davidson]] compared to the French defeat at [[Dien Bien Phu]]. In February 1990 the EPLF liberated the strategic port of Massawa and in the process destroyed a portion of the [[Ethiopian Navy]]. A year later the war came to conclusion on May 24, 1991, when the Ethiopian army in Eritrea surrendered. Thus Eritrea's 30-year war crowned with victory.

On May 24, 1993, after a UN-supervised referendum on April 23–25, 1993, in which the Eritrean people overwhelmingly, 99.8%, voted for independence, Eritrea officially declared its independence and gained international recognition.

==Namibia==
[[File:DSWA Flag02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|South African soldiers pose with a captured German flag after their successful invasion of South-West Africa in 1915.]]
At the onset of [[World War I]], the [[Union of South Africa]] participated in the invasion and occupation of several Allied territories taken from the [[German Empire]], most notably [[German South-West Africa]] and [[German East Africa]] ([[Tanzania]]). Germany's defeat forced the new [[Weimar Republic]] to cede its overseas possessions to the [[League of Nations]] as mandates. A mandate over South-West Africa was conferred upon the [[United Kingdom]], "for and on behalf of the government of the Union of South Africa", which was to handle administrative affairs under the supervision of the league. South-West Africa was classified as a "C" mandate, or a territory whose population sparseness, small size, remoteness, and geographic continuity to the mandatory power allowed it to be governed as an integral part of the mandatory itself. Nevertheless, the League of Nations obliged South Africa to promote social progress among indigenous inhabitants, refrain from establishing military bases there, and grant residence to missionaries of any nationality without restriction. Article 7 of the South-West Africa mandate stated that the consent of the league was required for any changes in the terms of the mandate.

With regards to the local German population, the occupation was on especially lenient terms; South Africa only repatriated civil and military officials, along with a small handful of political undesirables. Other German civilians were allowed to remain. In 1924 all white South-West Africans were automatically naturalised as South African nationals and British subjects thereof; the exception being about 260 who lodged specific objections. In 1926 a Legislative Assembly was created to represent German, Afrikaans, and English-speaking white residents. Control over basic administrative matters, including taxation, was surrendered to the new assembly, while matters pertaining to defence and native affairs remained in the hands of an administrator-general.

Following [[World War II]], South-West Africa's international status after the dissolution of the League of Nations was questioned. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] refused South Africa permission to incorporate the mandate as a fifth province, largely due to its controversial policy of racial ''[[apartheid]]''. At the General Assembly's request the issue was examined at the [[International Court of Justice]]. The court ruled in 1950 that South Africa was not required to transfer the mandate to UN trusteeship, but remained obligated to adhere to its original terms, including the submission of annual reports on conditions in the territory. [[File:Regiment Windhoek1.PNG|thumb|right|300px|South African military convoy in Namibia, 1978.]]Led by newly elected [[Afrikaner]] [[nationalist]] [[Daniel François Malan]], the South African government rejected this opinion and refused to recognise the competence of the UN to interfere with South-West African affairs. In 1960 Ethiopia and [[Liberia]], the only two other former League of Nations member states in Africa, petitioned the Hague to rule in a binding decision that the league mandate was still in force and to hold South Africa responsible for failure to provide the highest material and moral welfare of black South-West Africans. It was pointed out that nonwhite residents were subject to all the restrictive ''apartheid'' legislation affecting nonwhites in South Africa, including confinement to reserves, colour bars in employment, [[pass laws]], and influx control over urban migrants. A South African attempt to scupper proceedings by arguing that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the case was rejected; conversely, however, the court itself ruled that Ethiopia and Liberia did not possess the necessary legal interest entitling them to bring the case.

In October 1966 the General Assembly declared that South Africa had failed to fulfill its obligations as the mandatory power and had in fact disavowed them. The mandate was unilaterally terminated on the grounds that the UN would now assume direct responsibility for South-West Africa. In 1967 and 1969 the UN called for South Africa's disengagement and requested the Security Council to take measures to oust the [[South African Defence Force]] from the territory that the General Assembly, at the request of black leaders in exile, had officially renamed [[Namibia]]. One of the greatest aggravating obstacles to eventual independence occurred when the UN also agreed to recognise the [[South West African People's Organization]] (SWAPO), then an almost exclusively [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] body, as the sole authentic representative of the Namibian population. South Africa was offended by the General Assembly's simultaneous dismissal of its various internal Namibian parties as puppets of the occupying power. Furthermore, SWAPO espoused a militant platform which called for independence through UN activity, including military intervention.

By 1965 SWAPO's morale had been elevated by the formation of a guerrilla wing, the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), which forced the deployment of [[South African Police]] troops along the long and remote northern frontier. The first armed clashes between PLAN cadres and local security forces took place in August 1966.

'''Al Wafeer Air''' (Arabic:''Al-Wafeer Al Thoyaran'') was a charter airline based in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. Its main operations were [[Hajj]] and [[Umrah]] charters. It was founded by Adnan Dabbagh, former Executive Vice-President of Operations of [[Saudia]]. The major stakeholders in the carrier were Saudia which held a (40%) stake in the carrier, with [[Bin Laden Group]], the Naghi Group and Al Tayyar Travel Group holding (12.75%).

Al Wafeer ended operations in 2011.

In February 2011, a Malaysian daily reported that cabin crews working with Al Wafeer were only paid half of their salaries and also their allowances payment had been put on hold. However, the issue was solved when Al Wafeer agreed to pay the outstanding dues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharian.com.my/articles/AlwafeerAirbayarseparuhgajiperamugari/Article/ Al Wafeer Air bayar separuh gaji peramugari] Berita Harian Online, 21 February 2011 (in Malay)&lt;/ref&gt;

The heritage of the [[Classical Greece|classical era]] is still evident in the city, represented by [[ancient monument]]s and works of art, the most famous of all being the [[Parthenon]], considered a key landmark of early [[Western culture|Western civilization]].

Athens is home to two [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]], the [[Acropolis of Athens]] and the medieval [[Daphni Monastery]]. Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the [[Old Royal Palace|Hellenic Parliament]] and the so-called "architectural trilogy of Athens", consisting of the [[National Library of Greece]], the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]] and the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]]. Athens is also home to several museums and cultural institutions, such as the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archeological Museum]], featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, the [[Acropolis Museum]], the [[Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art|Museum of Cycladic Art]], the [[Benaki Museum]] and the [[Byzantine and Christian Museum]]. Athens was the host city of the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern-day Olympic Games]] in 1896, and 108 years later it welcomed home the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], making it one of only a handful of cities to have hosted the Olympics more than once.&lt;ref name=oly&gt;{{cite news|title=Sentiment a factor as Athens gets 2004 Olympics |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/news/1997/09/05/athens_update/ |author=((CNN &amp; Sports Illustrated)) |publisher=sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=5 September 1997 |accessdate=28 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519032341/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/news/1997/09/05/athens_update/ |archivedate=19 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Athena Varvakeion - MANA - Fidias.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Athena]], patron goddess of Athens; ([[Varvakeion Athena]], [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]])]]

In [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], the name of the city was {{lang|grc|Ἀθῆναι}} (''Athēnai'', {{IPA-el|a.tʰɛ̂ː.nai̯|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]) a plural. In earlier Greek, such as [[Homeric Greek]], the name had been current in the singular form though, as {{lang|grc|Ἀθήνη}} (''Athēnē'').&lt;ref&gt;As for example in [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+7&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0135 Od.7.80].&lt;/ref&gt; It was possibly rendered in the plural later on, like those of {{lang|grc|Θῆβαι}} (''[[Thebes, Greece|Thêbai]]'') and {{lang|grc|Μυκῆναι}} (''[[Mycenae|Μukênai]]''). The root of the word is probably not of Greek or [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin,&lt;ref name="Beekes2009"&gt;{{citation|last=Beekes|first=Robert S. P.|authorlink=Robert Beekes|title=Etymological Dictionary of Greek|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden and Boston|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is possibly a remnant of the [[Pre-Greek substrate]] of Attica.&lt;ref name="Beekes2009"/&gt; In antiquity, it was debated whether Athens took its name from its patron goddess [[Athena]] ([[Attic Greek|Attic]] {{lang|grc|Ἀθηνᾶ}}, ''Athēnā'', [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] {{lang|grc|Ἀθήνη}}, ''Athēnē'', and [[Doric Greek|Doric]] {{lang|grc|Ἀθάνα}}, ''Athānā'') or Athena took her name from the city.&lt;ref name="Burkert1985"&gt;{{citation|last=Burkert|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Burkert|date=1985|title=Greek Religion|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-36281-0|page=139|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars now generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city,&lt;ref name="Burkert1985"/&gt; because the ending -''ene'' is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names.&lt;ref name="Burkert1985"/&gt; During the medieval period, the name of the city was rendered once again in the singular as {{lang|el|Ἀθήνα}}. However, after the establishment of the modern Greek state, and partly due to the conservatism of the written language, {{lang|el|Ἀθῆναι}} {{IPA-el|aˈθine|}} became again the official name of the city and remained so until the abandonment of [[Katharevousa]] in the 1970s, when Ἀθήνα, ''Athína'', became the official name.

According to the ancient Athenian [[founding myth]], Athena, the goddess of wisdom, competed against [[Poseidon]], the god of the seas, for patronage of the yet-unnamed city;&lt;ref name="Kerényi1951"&gt;{{citation|last=Kerényi|first=Karl|authorlink=Károly Kerényi|title=The Gods of the Greeks|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London, England|date=1951|isbn=0-500-27048-1|page=124|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; they agreed that whoever gave the Athenians the better gift would become their patron&lt;ref name="Kerényi1951"/&gt; and appointed [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], the king of Athens, as the judge.&lt;ref name="Kerényi1951"/&gt; According to the account given by [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], Poseidon struck the ground with his [[Trident of Poseidon|trident]] and a salt water spring welled up.&lt;ref name="Kerényi1951"/&gt; In an alternative version of the myth from [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'', Poseidon instead gave the Athenians the first horse.&lt;ref name="Kerényi1951"/&gt; In both versions, Athena offered the Athenians the first domesticated [[olive tree]].&lt;ref name="Kerényi1951"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garland2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Robert|title=Ancient Greece: Everyday Life in the Birthplace of Western Civilization|date=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-1-4549-0908-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cecrops accepted this gift&lt;ref name="Kerényi1951"/&gt; and declared Athena the patron goddess of Athens.&lt;ref name="Kerényi1951"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garland2008"/&gt;

Different etymologies, now commonly rejected, were proposed during the 19th century. [[Christian Lobeck]] proposed as the root of the name the word {{lang|grc|ἄθος}} (''áthos'') or {{lang|grc|ἄνθος}} (''ánthos'') meaning "flower", to denote Athens as the "flowering city". [[Johann Christoph Wilhelm Ludwig Döderlein|Ludwig von Döderlein]] proposed the stem of the verb {{lang|grc|θάω}}, stem θη- (''tháō'', ''thē-'', "to suck") to denote Athens as having fertile soil.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Great Greek Encyclopedia]]'', vol. II, Athens 1927, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical literature, the city was sometimes referred to as the [[City of the Violet Crown]], first documented in Pindar's ἰοστέφανοι Ἀθᾶναι (''iostéphanoi Athânai''), or as {{lang|grc|τὸ κλεινὸν ἄστυ}} (''tò kleinòn ásty'', "the glorious city"). In medieval texts, variant names include Setines, Satine, and Astines, all derivations involving [[false splitting]] of prepositional phrases.&lt;ref name="Bourne1887"&gt;{{Cite journal

The basin is bounded by four large mountains: [[Mount Aigaleo]] to the west, Mount [[Parnitha]] to the north, [[Mount Pentelicus]] to the northeast and Mount [[Hymettus]] to the east.&lt;ref name="Focus on Athens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanheatisland.info/images/newsletter/UHI_newsletter_Issue_1.pdf|title=Focus on Athens|accessdate=18 March 2011|work=UHI Quarterly Newsletter, Issue 1, May 2009, page 2|publisher=www.urbanheatisland.info|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722204815/http://www.urbanheatisland.info/images/newsletter/UHI_newsletter_Issue_1.pdf|archivedate=22 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond Mount Aegaleo lies the [[Thriasian plain]], which forms an extension of the central plain to the west. The [[Saronic Gulf]] lies to the southwest. Mount Parnitha is the tallest of the four mountains ({{convert|1413|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parnitha-np.gr/welcome.htm |title=Welcome!!! |publisher=Parnitha-np.gr |accessdate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been declared a [[national park]].

Athens is built around a number of hills. [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus]] is one of the tallest hills of the city proper and provides a view of the entire Attica Basin. The geomorphology of Athens is deemed to be one of the most complex in the world because its mountains cause a [[inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]] phenomenon which, along with the Greek Government's difficulties controlling industrial pollution, was responsible for the air pollution problems the city has faced.&lt;ref name=tung/&gt; This issue is not unique to Athens; for instance, Los Angeles and [[Mexico City]] also suffer from similar geomorphology inversion problems.&lt;ref name=tung&gt;{{cite book |last=Tung |first=Anthony |chapter=The City the Gods Besieged |title=Preserving the World's Great Cities: The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis |year=2001 |location=New York |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=0-609-80815-X |page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus]] river, the [[Ilisos]] and the [[Eridanos (Athens)|Eridanos]] stream are the historical rivers of Athens.

By the late 1970s, the pollution of Athens had become so destructive that according to the then Greek [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister of Culture]], Constantine Trypanis, "''...the carved details on the five the caryatids of the Erechtheum had seriously degenerated, while the face of the horseman on the Parthenon's west side was all but obliterated.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918645,00.html |title=Acropolis: Threat of Destruction |publisher=Time.com |work=Time Magazine |date=31 January 1977 |accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of measures taken by the authorities of the city throughout the 1990s resulted in the improvement of air quality; the appearance of smog (or ''nefos'' as the Athenians used to call it) has become less common.

Measures taken by the Greek authorities throughout the 1990s have improved the quality of air over the Attica Basin. Nevertheless, air pollution still remains an issue for Athens, particularly during the hottest summer days. In late June 2007,&lt;ref name=outraged&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/07/16/news/greece.php |title=As forest fires burn, suffocated Athens is outraged |first=Niki |last=Kitsantonis |date=16 July 2007 |accessdate=3 February 2008 |work=International Herald Tribune |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918215853/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/07/16/news/greece.php |archivedate=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Attica]] region experienced a number of [[2007 Greek forest fires|brush fires]],&lt;ref name=outraged/&gt; including a blaze that burned a significant portion of a large forested national park in [[Parnitha|Mount Parnitha]],&lt;ref name=ypexode&gt;{{cite press release|script-title=el:Συνέντευξη Τύπου Γ.

The major waste management efforts undertaken in the last decade (particularly the plant built on the small island of Psytalia) have improved [[water quality]] in the Saronic Gulf, and the coastal waters of Athens are now accessible again to swimmers. In January 2007, Athens faced a waste management problem when its [[landfill]] near [[Ano Liosia]], an Athenian suburb, reached capacity.&lt;ref name=overflow&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/819945/rot_sets_in_as_athenss_trash_problem_mounts/index.html |title=Rot sets in as Athens's trash problem mounts |date=30 January 2007 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114065511/http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/819945/rot_sets_in_as_athenss_trash_problem_mounts/index.html |archivedate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis eased by mid-January when authorities began taking the garbage to a temporary landfill.&lt;ref name=overflow/&gt;

==== Climate ====
Athens has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''). The dominant feature of Athens’ climate is alternation between prolonged hot and dry summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;Founda D. (2011). "Evolution of the air temperature in Athens and evidence of climatic change: A review". Advances in Building Energy Research, 5,1, 7–41, http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/earthscan/aber/2011/00000005/00000001/art00001.&lt;/ref&gt; With an average of {{convert|416.8|mm|in}} of yearly precipitation, rainfall occurs largely between the months of October and April. July and August are the driest months, when thunderstorms occur sparsely once or twice a month.

Owing to the [[rain shadow]] of the Pindus Mountains, annual precipitation of Athens is lower than most other parts of Greece, especially western Greece. As an example, [[Ioannina]] receives around {{convert|1300|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year, and [[Agrinio]] around {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year. Daily average highs for July (1988–2017) have been measured at {{convert|34.4|C|disp=or}},&lt;ref name="meteoclub"/&gt; but some parts of the city may be even hotter, in particular western areas due to a combination of industrialization and a number of natural factors, knowledge of which has existed since the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Κωνσταντίνος Μαυρογιάννης, Αθήναι (1981).''Παρατηρήσεις επί του κλίματος των Αθηνών και της ενεργείας αυτού επί της ζωϊκής οικονομίας'' σελ 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eib.org/attachments/pipeline/20090584_eia_el.pdf|date=22 June 2007|title=ΕΡΓΟ ΑΝΑΒΑΘΜΙΣΗΣ ΔΙΥΛΙΣΤΗΡΙΟΥ ΕΛΕΥΣΙΝΑΣ|author=hpanitsidis|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giannopoulou K., Livada I., Santamouris M., Saliari M., Assimakopoulos M., Caouris Y.G.

The municipality of Athens, the city centre of the Athens Urban Area, is divided into several districts: [[Omonoia Square|Omonoia]], [[Syntagma Square|Syntagma]], [[Exarcheia]], Agios Nikolaos, Neapolis, [[Mount Lycabettus|Lykavittos]], Lofos Strefi, Lofos Finopoulou, Lofos Filopappou, [[Pedion tou Areos|Pedion Areos]], [[Metaxourgeio]], Aghios Kostantinos, [[Larissa Station]], [[Kerameikos]], [[Psiri]], [[Monastiraki]], [[Gazi, Athens|Gazi]], [[Thiseio|Thission]], [[Church of Panaghia Kapnikarea|Kapnikarea]], Aghia Irini, Aerides, Anafiotika, [[Plaka]], [[Acropolis]], [[Pnyx|Pnyka]], Makrygianni, Lofos Ardittou, [[Zappeion]], Aghios Spyridon, [[Pangrati]], [[Kolonaki]], Dexameni, Evaggelismos, Gouva, Aghios Ioannis, [[Neos Kosmos, Athens|Neos Kosmos]], [[Koukaki]], Kynosargous, Fix, Ano Petralona, Kato Petralona, Rouf, [[Votanikos]], Profitis Daniil, [[Akadimia Platonos]], [[Kolonos]], Kolokynthou, Attikis Square, Lofos Skouze, Sepolia, [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]], Aghios Meletios, Nea Kypseli, Gyzi, Polygono, [[Ambelokipi, Athens|Ampelokipoi]], Panormou-Gerokomeio, Pentagono, Ellinorosson, [[Nea Filothei]], Ano Kypseli, Tourkovounia-Lofos Patatsou, Lofos Elikonos, Koliatsou, Thymarakia, Kato Patisia, Treis Gefyres, Aghios Eleftherios, [[Ano Patissia|Ano Patisia]], Kypriadou, Menidi, Prompona, Aghios Panteleimonas, [[Pangrati]], Goudi and Ilisia.

* '''Omonoia''', [[Omonoia Square]], ({{lang-el|Πλατεία Ομονοίας}}) is the oldest square in Athens. It is surrounded by hotels and fast food outlets, and contains a train station used by the [[Athens Metro]] and the Ilektrikos, named [[Omonoia station]]. The square is the focus for celebration of sporting victories, as seen after the country's winning of the [[Euro 2004]] and the [[Eurobasket 2005]] tournaments.
* '''Metaxourgeio''' ({{lang-el|Μεταξουργείο}}) is a neighborhood of Athens. The neighborhood is located north of the historical centre of Athens, between Kolonos to the east and Kerameikos to the west, and north of Gazi. [[Metaxourgeio]] is frequently described as a transition neighborhood. After a long period of abandonment in the late 20th century, the area is acquiring a reputation as an artistic and fashionable neighborhood following the opening of art galleries, museums, restaurants and cafés. [1] Local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighborhood have reinforced a sense of community and artistic expression. Anonymous art pieces containing quotes and statements in both English and Ancient Greek have sprung up throughout the neighborhood, bearing statements such as "Art for art's sake" (Τέχνη τέχνης χάριν). [[Guerilla gardening]] has also helped to beautify the area.
* '''Psiri and Gazi''' – The reviving [[Psiri]] ({{lang-el|Ψυρρή}}) neighbourhood – also known as Athens's "meat packing district" – is dotted with renovated former mansions, artists' spaces, and small gallery areas. A number of its renovated buildings also host fashionable bars, making it a hotspot for the city in the last decade, while live music restaurants known as "rebetadika", after [[rebetiko]], a unique form of music that blossomed in [[Syros]] and Athens from the 1920s until the 1960s, are to be found. Rebetiko is admired by many, and as a result rebetadika are often crammed with people of all ages who will sing, dance and drink till dawn.

The [[Gazi, Athens|Gazi]] ({{lang-el|Γκάζι}}) area, one of the latest in full redevelopment, is located around a historic gas factory, now converted into the ''[[Technopolis (Gazi)|Technopolis]]'' cultural multiplex, and also includes artists' areas, small clubs, bars and restaurants, as well as Athens's "[[Gay village]]". The metro's expansion to the western suburbs of the city has brought easier access to the area since spring 2007, as the blue line now stops at Gazi ([[Kerameikos]] station).
* '''Syntagma''', [[Syntagma Square]], ({{lang-el|Σύνταγμα}}/Constitution Square), is the capital's central and [[List of city squares by size|largest square]], lying adjacent to the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek Parliament]] (the former Royal Palace) and the city's most notable [[Grande Bretagne|hotels]]. Ermou Street, an approximately {{convert|1|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off|adj=mid|-long}} pedestrian road connecting [[Syntagma Square]] to Monastiraki, is a consumer paradise for both Athenians and tourists. Complete with fashion shops and shopping centres promoting most international brands, it now finds itself in the top five most expensive shopping streets in Europe, and the tenth most expensive retail street in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cushwake.com/cwglobal/jsp/newsDetail.jsp?repId=c7800055p&amp;LanId=EN&amp;LocId=GLOBAL |title=Cushman &amp; Wakefield – Global real estate solutions – News &amp; Events |publisher=Cushwake.com |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927081611/http://www.cushwake.com/cwglobal/jsp/newsDetail.jsp?repId=c7800055p&amp;LanId=EN&amp;LocId=GLOBAL |archivedate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby, the renovated Army Fund building in Panepistimiou Street includes the "Attica" [[department store]] and several upmarket designer stores.
* '''Plaka, Monastiraki, and Thission''' – [[Plaka]] ({{lang-el|Πλάκα}}), lying just beneath the [[Acropolis]], is famous for its plentiful [[neoclassical architecture]], making up one of the most scenic districts of the city. It remains a prime tourist destination with [[taverna]]s, live performances and street salesmen. Nearby [[Monastiraki]] ({{lang-el|Μοναστηράκι}}), for its part, is known for its string of small shops and markets, as well as its crowded [[flea market]] and tavernas specialising in [[souvlaki]]. Another district known for its student-crammed, stylish cafés is [[Temple of Hephaestus|Theseum]] or Thission ({{lang-el|Θησείο}}), lying just west of Monastiraki. Thission is home to the ancient [[Temple of Hephaestus]], standing atop a small hill. This area also has a picturesque 11th-century Byzantine church, as well as a 15th-century Ottoman mosque.
* '''[[Exarcheia]]''' ({{lang-el|Εξάρχεια}}), located north of Kolonaki, is the location of the city's [[anarchism|anarchist]] scene and as a student quarter with cafés, bars and bookshops. Exarcheia is home to the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic]] and the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]]; it also contains important buildings of several 20th-century styles: [[Neoclassicism]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modern architecture|Early Modernism]] (including [[Bauhaus]] influences).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
* '''[[Kolonaki]]''' ({{lang-el|Κολωνάκι}}) is the area at the base of [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus hill]], full of boutiques catering to well-heeled customers by day, and bars and more fashionable restaurants by night, with galleries and museums. This is often regarded as one of the more prestigious areas of the capital.

==== Parks and zoos ====
[[File:20100411 athina100.JPG|thumb|upright|The entrance of the [[National Garden of Athens|National Gardens]], commissioned by [[Amalia of Oldenburg|Queen Amalia]] in 1838 and completed by 1840]]

Parnitha National Park is punctuated by well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves dotting the protected area. Hiking and mountain-biking in all four mountains are popular outdoor activities for residents of the city. The [[National Garden of Athens]] was completed in 1840 and is a green refuge of 15.5 hectares in the centre of the Greek capital. It is to be found between the Parliament and [[Zappeion]] buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares.

Parts of the city centre have been redeveloped under a masterplan called the ''Unification of Archeological Sites of Athens'', which has also gathered funding from the EU to help enhance the project.&lt;ref name=EUfund/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astynet.gr/ |title=Eaxa :: Ενοποιηση Αρχαιολογικων Χωρων Αθηνασ Α.Ε |publisher=Astynet.gr |accessdate=21 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228090100/http://www.astynet.gr/ |archivedate=28 February 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark [[Dionysiou Areopagitou Street]] has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near [[Plaka]], and finishes just beyond the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in [[Thiseio]]. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the [[Parthenon]] and the [[ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]] (the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the busy city centre.

The hills of Athens also provide green space. [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus]], [[Philopappos Monument|Philopappos hill]] and the area around it, including [[Pnyx]] and [[Ardettos hill]], are planted with pines and other trees, with the character of a small forest rather than typical metropolitan parkland. Also to be found is the [[Pedion tou Areos]] (''Field of Mars'') of 27.7 hectares, near the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]].

Athens' largest zoo is the [[Attica Zoological Park]], a 20-hectare (49-acre) private zoo located in the suburb of Spata. The zoo is home to around 2000 animals representing 400 species, and is open 365 days a year. Smaller zoos exist within public gardens or parks, such as the zoo within the National Garden of Athens.

=== Surrounding areas ===

The large '''City Centre''' of the Greek capital falls directly within the municipality of Athens, which is the largest in population size in Greece. [[Piraeus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://distances-from.com/p/Athens-Greece-and-Piraeus-Greece |title=Distance between Athens, Greece and Piraeus, Greece |publisher=distances-from.com |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=8 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also forms a significant city centre on its own, within the Athens Urban Area and being the second largest in population size within it, with [[Peristeri]] and [[Kallithea]] following.

==== Urban and suburban municipalities ====
[[File:Βίλα Ατλαντίς 3473.jpg|alt=|thumb|View of Vila Atlantis, in [[Kifissia]], designed by [[Ernst Ziller]].]]
[[File:Vouliagmeni from Oceanis.JPG|thumb|Beach in Vouliagmeni, one of the many beaches in the southern coast of Athens]]

The Athens Metropolitan Area consists of 58&lt;ref name="statistics1"/&gt; densely populated municipalities, sprawling around the municipality of Athens (the city centre) in virtually all directions. For the Athenians, all the urban municipalities surrounding the city centre are called suburbs. According to their geographic location in relation to the City of Athens, the suburbs are divided into four zones; the northern suburbs (including [[Agios Stefanos, Attica|Agios Stefanos]], [[Dionysos, Greece|Dionysos]], [[Ekali]], [[Nea Erythraia]], [[Kifissia]], [[Marousi|Maroussi]], [[Pefki]], [[Lykovrysi]], [[Metamorfosi]], [[Nea Ionia]], [[Nea Filadelfeia]], [[Irakleio, Attica|Irakleio]], [[Vrilissia]], [[Melissia]], [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], [[Chalandri]], [[Agia Paraskevi]], [[Galatsi]], [[Psychiko]] and [[Filothei]]); the southern suburbs (including [[Alimos]], [[Nea Smyrni]], [[Moschato]], [[Kallithea]], [[Agios Dimitrios]], [[Palaio Faliro]], [[Ellinikon|Elliniko]], [[Glyfada]], [[Argyroupoli]], [[Ilioupoli]], [[Voula]] and [[Vouliagmeni]]); the eastern suburbs (including [[Zografou]], [[Dafni, Attica|Dafni]], [[Vyronas]], [[Kaisariani]], [[Cholargos]] and [[Papagou]]); and the western suburbs (including [[Peristeri]], [[Ilion, Greece|Ilion]], [[Egaleo]], [[Koridallos]], [[Agia Varvara]], [[Chaidari]], [[Petroupoli]], [[Agioi Anargyroi]] and [[Kamatero]]).

The Athens city coastline, extending from the major commercial port of [[Piraeus]] to the southernmost suburb of [[Varkiza]] for some {{convert|25|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Greece_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Piraeus%20(Attiki)&amp;toplace=Varkiza%20(Piraios%20Nomos)&amp;fromlat=37.9474464019929&amp;tolat=37.8185988001751&amp;fromlng=23.6370849609375&amp;tolng=23.7987041473389 |title=Distance between Piraeus (Attiki) and Varkiza (Piraios Nomos) (Greece) |publisher=Distancecalculator.globefeed.com |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also connected to the city centre by a tram.

In the northern suburb of Maroussi, the upgraded main [[Athens Olympic Sports Complex|Olympic Complex]] (known by its Greek acronym OAKA) dominates the skyline. The area has been redeveloped according to a design by the Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], with steel arches, landscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic glass, and a landmark new blue glass roof which was added to the main stadium. A second Olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of Palaio Faliro, also features modern stadia, shops and an elevated esplanade. Work is underway to transform the grounds of the old Athens Airport – named [[Ellinikon International Airport|Elliniko]] – in the southern suburbs, into one of the largest landscaped parks in Europe, to be named the [[Hellenikon Metropolitan Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minenv.gr/hellenikon-competition/oa/en/main.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408211156/http://www.minenv.gr/hellenikon-competition/oa/en/main.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 April 2004 |work=Hellenic Ministry of the Environment and Public Works |title=Hellenikon Metropolitan Park Competition |accessdate=3 January 2007 |publisher=www.minenv.gr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the southern suburbs (such as [[Alimos]], [[Palaio Faliro]], [[Ellinikon|Elliniko]], [[Glyfada]], [[Voula]], [[Vouliagmeni]] and [[Varkiza]]) known as the [[Athens Riviera]], host a number of sandy beaches, most of which are operated by the [[Greek National Tourism Organization|Greek National Tourism Organisation]] and require an entrance fee. Casinos operate on both Mount Parnitha, some {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6252676.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Greek forest fire close to Athens |publisher=BBC News |date=29 June 2007 |accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; from downtown Athens (accessible by car or cable car), and the nearby town of [[Loutraki]] (accessible by car via the Athens – [[Corinth]] National Highway, or the suburban rail service [[Proastiakos]]).

==== Athens Urban Area ====

The Athens Urban Area today consists of 40 municipalities, 35 of which make up what is referred to as the Greater Athens municipalities, located within 4 regional units ([[North Athens (regional unit)|North Athens]], [[West Athens (regional unit)|West Athens]], [[Central Athens (regional unit)|Central Athens]], [[South Athens (regional unit)|South Athens]]); and a further 5, which make up the Greater Piraeus municipalities, located within the [[Piraeus (regional unit)|regional unit of Piraeus]] as mentioned above. The densely built up urban area of the Greek capital sprawls across {{convert|412|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=area/&gt; throughout the ''Attica Basin'' and has a total population of 3,074,160 (in 2011).

The Athens municipality forms the core and center of '''Greater Athens''', which consists of the Athens municipality and 34 more municipalities, divided in four [[regional units of Greece|regional units]] (Central, North, South and West Athens), accounting for 2,641,511 people (in 2011)&lt;ref name=census11/&gt; within an area of {{convert|361|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=area/&gt; Until 2010, these four regional units made up the abolished [[Athens Prefecture]]. The municipality of [[Piraeus]], the historic Athenian port, with its 4 suburban municipalities make up the [[Piraeus (regional unit)|regional unit of Piraeus]], which in turn forms '''Greater Piraeus'''.

'''Greater Athens''' and '''Greater Piraeus''' combined make up the continuous built up '''Athens Urban Area''' ({{lang-el|Πολεοδομικό Συγκρότημα Αθηνών}}), also called the '''Urban Area of the Capital''' ({{lang-el|Πολεοδομικό Συγκρότημα Πρωτεύουσας}}) or simply '''Athens''' (the most common use of the term), spanning over {{convert|412|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf |title=Kallikratis reform law text }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a population of 3,090,508 people as of 2011. The Athens Urban Area is considered to form the city of Athens as a whole, despite its administrative divisions, which is the largest in Greece and one of the most populated urban areas in [[Europe]].

==== Population in ancient times ====
[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] Athens in 1600–1100&amp;nbsp;BC could have reached the size of [[Tiryns]]; that would put the population at the range of 10,000 – 15,000.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Citadel to City-State: The Transformation of Greece, 1200-700 B.C.E.|author1=Thomas, C.G.|author2=Conant, C.|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00325-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GP5cIqY--P0C|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Greek Dark Ages]] the population of Athens was around 4,000 people. In 700&amp;nbsp;BC the population grew to 10,000. In 500&amp;nbsp;BC the area probably contained 200,000 people. During the classical period the city's population is estimated from 150,000 – 350,000 and up to 610,000 according to [[Thucydides]]. When [[Demetrius of Phalerum]] conducted a population census in 317&amp;nbsp;BC the population was 21,000 free citizens, plus 10,000 resident aliens and 400,000 slaves. This suggests a total population of 431,000.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf|date=12 December 2005|title=The growth of Greek cities in the first millennium BC|author=Ian Morris|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Urbanism in the Preindustrial World: Cross-Cultural Approaches|author=Storey, G.|date=2006|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-5246-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P43ChiFyVVEC|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles and the Tragedy of Athenian Democracy|author=Beer, J.|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-313-28946-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdaUDraNyPgC|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=After Collapse: The Regeneration of Complex Societies|author1=Schwartz, G.M.|author2=Nichols, J.J.|date=2010|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0-8165-2936-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gsFrnn9RzQC|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="umn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~okuhlke/Archive/GEOG%203762%20Student%20PDFs/Athens.pdf|date=9 December 2008|title=Urban History of Athens|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Marathon Fighters and Men of Maple: Ancient Acharnai|author=Kellogg, D.L.|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166386-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMnRAgAAQBAJ|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Three Studies in Athenian Demography|author=Hansen, M.H.|date=1988|publisher=Commissioner, Munksgaard|isbn=9788773041895|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=navdHEZqucUC|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google7"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece|author=Wilson, N.|date=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-78800-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pXhAQAAQBAJ|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google8"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Regime of Demetrius of Phalerum in Athens, 317–307 BCE: A Philosopher in Politics|author=O'Sullivan, L.|date=2009|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004178885|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKtYuyVToG0C|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is highly suspect because of the lopsided number of slaves and does not include free women and children and resident foreigners: an estimated based on Thucydides is: 40,000 male citizens, 100,000 family members, 70,000 metics (resident foreigners) and 150,000-400,000 slaves.  However the numbers would include Attica and not just Athens the city.&lt;ref name="umn"/&gt;

The ancient site of Athens is centred on the rocky hill of the acropolis. In ancient times the port of [[Piraeus]] was a separate city, but it has now been absorbed into the Athens Urban Area. The rapid expansion of the city, which continues to this day, was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s, because of Greece's transition from an agricultural to an [[Developed country|industrial nation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gto.gr/athens/athens/athens.html Greek Tourist Organizer] – Retrieved on 6 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion is now particularly toward the East and North East (a tendency greatly related to the new [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]] and the [[Attiki Odos]], the freeway that cuts across [[Attica]]). By this process Athens has engulfed many former suburbs and villages in Attica, and continues to do so. The table below shows the historical population of Athens in recent times.

== Government and politics ==

Athens became the capital of Greece in 1834, following [[Nafplion]], which was the provisional capital from 1829. The municipality (City) of Athens is also the capital of the [[Attica (region)|Attica region]]. The term ''Athens'' can refer either to the municipality of Athens, to Greater Athens, or to the entire Athens Urban Area.

[[File:ATTICA, Athens. Circa 545-525-15 BC.jpg|thumb|The earliest coinage of Athens, circa 545-525/15 BC]]
The oldest known human presence in Athens is the Cave of Schist, which has been dated to between the 11th and 7th millennia BC.&lt;ref name=ethnos.gr/&gt; Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 7000 years.&lt;ref&gt;S. Immerwahr, The Athenian Agora XIII: the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, Princeton 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tung/&gt;
By 1400&amp;nbsp;BC the settlement had become an important centre of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilization and the Acropolis was the site of a major [[Mycenae]]an fortress, whose remains can be recognised from sections of the characteristic [[Cyclopean]] walls.&lt;ref&gt;Iakovides, S. 1962. 'E mykenaïke akropolis ton Athenon'. Athens.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as [[Mycenae]] and [[Pylos]], it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200&amp;nbsp;BC, an event often attributed to a [[Dorians|Dorian]] invasion, and the Athenians always maintained that they were "pure" [[Ionians]] with no Dorian element. However, Athens, [[Bronze Age collapse|like many other Bronze Age settlements]], went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Duchy of Athens (de la Roche family).svg|alt=|left|thumb|156x156px|Coat of Arms of the [[Duchy of Athens]] during the rule of the [[de la Roche family]] (13th century)]]
[[Iron Age]] burials, in the [[Kerameikos]] and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900&amp;nbsp;BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, R. 1996, 2009. ''Greece in the Making 1200 – 479&amp;nbsp;BC''.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading position of Athens may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and [[Sparta]].

[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|[[Delian League]], under the leadership of Athens before the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431&amp;nbsp;BC]]

By the 6th century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of [[Solon]]. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by [[Cleisthenes]] in 508&amp;nbsp;BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the [[Ionian Revolt|rebellion of the Ionian cities]] against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule. In the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]] Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490&amp;nbsp;BC, and crucially at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] in 480&amp;nbsp;BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being captured and sacked twice by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] within one year, after a heroic resistance at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] by [[Sparta]]ns and other Greeks led by [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHe0KeXyL_AC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=persians+sack+athens&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e0GaVI3CBsWzUdykg6gL&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=persians%20sack%20athens&amp;f=false|title=Nothing Less than Victory: Decisive Wars and the Lessons of History|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after both [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] fell to the Persians.

The decades that followed became known as the [[Fifth-century Athens|Golden Age of Athenian democracy]], during which time Athens became the leading city of [[Ancient Greece]], with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for [[western culture|Western civilization]]. The playwrights [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], the physician [[Hippocrates]], and the philosopher [[Socrates]]. Guided by [[Pericles]], who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the [[Parthenon]]), as well as empire-building via the [[Delian League]]. Originally intended as an association of Greek city-states to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404&amp;nbsp;BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival [[Sparta]].

By the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of [[Macedon]] was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338&amp;nbsp;BC the armies of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a free city because of its widely admired schools. The Roman emperor [[Hadrian]], in the 2nd century CE, constructed a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]].

By the end of [[Late Antiquity]], the city experienced decline followed by recovery in the second half of the Middle Byzantine Period, in the 9th to 10th centuries CE, and was relatively prosperous during the [[Crusades]], benefiting from Italian trade. After the [[Fourth Crusade]] the [[Duchy of Athens]] was established. In 1458 it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and entered a long period of decline.

[[File:Peter von Hess - The Entry of King Othon of Greece in Athens - WGA11387.jpg|thumb|''The Entry of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]] in Athens'', [[Peter von Hess]], 1839.]]

Following the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons. At the time, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first [[King of Greece]], Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.

The first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the [[Acropolis]], the ancient cemetery of [[Kerameikos]] and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the [[Greek Parliament]]), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital. In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern [[Olympic Games]]. During the 1920s a number of [[Greek refugees]], expelled from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following [[World War II]], and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded, and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.

In the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the [[Attiki Odos]] motorway, the expansion of the [[Athens Metro]], and the new [[Athens International Airport]]), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004 Athens hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].

=== Archaeological hub ===
The city is a world centre of [[archaeology|archaeological research]]. Along with  national institutions, such as the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|Athens University]] and  the [[Archaeological Society of Athens|Archaeological Society]], there are multiple archaeological Museums including the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]], the [[Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art|Cycladic Museum]], the [[Epigraphy|Epigraphic]] Museum, the [[Byzantine &amp; Christian Museum]], as well as museums at the ancient [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]], [[Acropolis Museum|Acropolis]], [[Kerameikos]], and the [[Kerameikos Archaeological Museum]].  The city is also home to the [[Democritus|Demokritos]] laboratory for [[Archaeological science|Archaeometry]], alongside regional and national archaeological authorities that form part of the [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Greek Department of Culture]].

Athens hosts 17 [[List of Foreign Archaeological Institutes in Greece|Foreign Archaeological Institutes]] which promote and facilitate research by scholars from their home countries. As a result, Athens has more than a dozen archaeological libraries and three specialized archaeological laboratories, and is the venue of several hundred specialized lectures, conferences and seminars, as well as dozens of archaeological exhibitions, each year. At any given time, hundreds of international scholars and researchers in all disciplines of archaeology are to be found in the city.

Athens incorporates [[architectural style]]s ranging from [[Greek Revival architecture|Greco-Roman]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] to modern times. They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict [[height restriction laws]] in order to ensure the Acropolis hill is visible throughout the city.

For the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as [[Eclecticism]], especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the [[Old Royal Palace]] was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, [[Baron Theophil von Hansen|Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]] and [[Ernst Ziller]] took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] and the [[Zappeion]] Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]]'s [[Iliou Melathron]].

Beginning in the 1920s, [[Modern architecture]] including [[Bauhaus]] and [[Art Deco]] began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include [[Kolonaki]], and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]]. ''Ελληνική Αρχιτεκτονική Εταιρεία: Αρχιτέκτονες του 20ού αιώνα: Μέλη της Εταιρείας'', Ποταμός, Athens, 2009, p. XXV and p. XXI, {{ISBN|960-6691-38-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s during the extension and development of Athens, other modern movements such as the [[International Style (architecture)|International style]] played an important role. The centre of Athens was largely rebuilt, leading to the demolition of a number of neoclassical buildings. The architects of this era employed materials such as glass, marble and aluminium, and many blended modern and classical elements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]]. ''Ελληνική Αρχιτεκτονική Εταιρεία: Αρχιτέκτονες του 20ού αιώνα: Μέλη της Εταιρείας'', Ποταμός, Athens, 2009, p. XXXI, {{ISBN|960-6691-38-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], internationally known architects to have designed and built in the city included [[Walter Gropius]], with his design for the US Embassy, and, among others, [[Eero Saarinen]], in his postwar design for the east terminal of the [[Ellinikon International Airport|Ellinikon Airport]].

=== Urban sculpture ===
All over the city can be found several statues or busts. Apart from the neoclassicals by [[Leonidas Drosis]] at the Academy of Athens (Plato, Socrates, Apollo, Athena), other notable include the statue of [[Theseus]] by [[Georgios Fytalis]] at Thiseion, of philhellenes like [[Lord Byron]], [[George Canning]] and [[William Gladstone]], the equestrian statue of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] by [[Lazaros Sochos]] in front of the Old Parliament, statues of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Adamantios Korais]] at the University, of [[Evangelos Zappas]] and [[Konstantinos Zappas]] at Zappeion, of [[Ioannis Varvakis]] at the National Garden, the "woodbreaker" by [[Dimitrios Filippotis]], the equestrian statue of [[Alexandros Papagos]] at Papagou district and various busts of fighters of Greek independence at the [[Pedion tou Areos]]. An important landmark is also the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Syntagma.

Athens' most important museums include:
* the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]], the largest archaeological museum in the country, and one of the most important internationally, as it contains a vast collection of antiquities; its artifacts cover a period of more than 5,000 years, from late [[Neolithic]] Age to [[Roman Greece]];
* the [[Benaki Museum]] with its several branches for each of its collections including ancient, Byzantine, Ottoman-era, and Chinese art and beyond;

The new museum has proved considerably popular; almost one million people visited during the summer period June–October 2009 alone. A number of smaller and privately owned museums focused on Greek culture and arts are also to be found.
* the [[Kerameikos Archaeological Museum]], a museum which displays artifacts from the burial site of Kerameikos.  Much of the pottery and other artifacts relate to Athenian attitudes towards death and the afterlife, throughout many ages.
* the [[Jewish Museum of Greece]], a museum which describes the history and culture of [[History of the Jews in Greece|the Greek Jewish community]].

=== Tourism ===
Athens has been a destination for travellers since antiquity. Over the past decade, the city's infrastructure and social amenities have improved, in part because of its successful bid to stage the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]]. The Greek Government, aided by the EU, has funded major infrastructure projects such as the state-of-the-art [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aia.gr/UserFiles/File/235956_Englishl.pdf |title=AIA: Finance |publisher=www.AIA.gr |work=Athens International Airport, S.A. |accessdate=5 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205201638/http://www.aia.gr/UserFiles/File/235956_Englishl.pdf |archivedate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the expansion of the [[Athens Metro]] system,&lt;ref name=EUfund&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/themes/olympe/pages/focus_en.htm |title=Olympic Games 2004: five major projects for Athens |publisher=ec.europa.eu |work=European Union Regional Policy |accessdate=5 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520043310/http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/themes/olympe/pages/focus_en.htm |archivedate=20 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new [[Attiki Odos]] Motorway.&lt;ref name=EUfund/&gt;

==== Music ====
[[File:SNFCC at night.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center|SNFCC]] at night.]]
The most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the so-called Athenian serenades (Αθηναϊκές καντάδες), based on the [[Heptanese]]an [[Greek folk music#Ionian Islands|kantádhes]] (καντάδες '[[serenade]]s'; sing.: καντάδα) and the songs performed on stage (επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια 'theatrical revue songs') in [[revues]], [[Musical theatre|musical comedies]], [[operettas]] and [[nocturnes]] that were dominating Athens' theatre scene.

Notable composers of [[operetta]]s or [[nocturne]]s were [[Kostas Giannidis]], [[Dionysios Lavrangas]], [[Nikos Hatziapostolou]], while [[Theophrastos Sakellaridis]]' ''The Godson'' remains probably the most popular operetta. Despite the fact that the Athenian songs were not autonomous artistic creations (in contrast with the serenades) and despite their original connection with mainly [[Drama (Art Form)|dramatic forms of Art]], they eventually became hits as independent songs. Notable actors of Greek operettas, who made also a series of melodies and songs popular at that time, include [[Orestis Makris]], [[Kalouta sisters]], [[Vasilis Avlonitis]], [[Afroditi Laoutari]], [[Eleni Papadaki]], [[Marika Nezer]], [[Marika Krevata]] and others. After 1930, wavering among American and European musical influences as well as the Greek musical tradition. Greek composers begin to write music using the tunes of the [[Tango (dance)|tango]], [[waltz]], [[Swing music|swing]], [[foxtrot]], some times combined with melodies in the style of Athenian serenades' repertory. [[Nikos Gounaris]] was probably the most renowned composer and singer of the time.

In 1923, after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], many [[ethnic Greeks]] from [[Asia Minor]] fled to Athens as a result of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]]. They settled in poor neighborhoods and brought with them [[Rebetiko]] music, making it popular also in Greece, which became later the base for the [[Laïko]] music. Other forms of song popular today in Greece are elafrolaika, entechno, dimotika, and skyladika.&lt;ref name="Tales of Orpheus"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fT5TAQAAQBAJ |title=Athens – The Truth: Searching for Mános, Just Before the Bubble Burst|publisher=Tales of Orpheus |date=1 September 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013|isbn=9780955209031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece's most notable, and internationally famous, composers of Greek song, mainly of the entechno form, are Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis. Both composers have achieved fame abroad for their composition of film scores.&lt;ref name="Tales of Orpheus"/&gt;

=== Sports ===
==== Overview ====
Athens has a long tradition in sports and sporting events, serving as home to the most important clubs in [[Sport in Greece|Greek sport]] and housing a large number of sports facilities. The city has also been host to sports events of international importance.

Athens has hosted the [[Summer Olympic Games]] twice, in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]. The 2004 Summer Olympics required the development of the [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]], which has since gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world, and one of its most interesting modern monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.athens-today.com/e-olimpica_stadio.htm |title=Athens 21st Century – Athens Olympic Stadium |accessdate=26 December 2008 |publisher=Athens-today.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest stadium in the country, it hosted two finals of the [[UEFA Champions League]], in [[1994 UEFA Champions League Final|1994]] and [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final|2007]]. Athens' other major stadium, located in the [[Piraeus]] area, is the [[Karaiskakis Stadium]], a sports and entertainment complex, host of the [[1971 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1971 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]].

Athens has hosted the [[Euroleague]] final three times, the first in 1985 and second in [[FIBA European Championship 1992–93|1993]], both at the [[Peace and Friendship Stadium]], most known as SEF, a large indoor arena,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.athens-today.com/e-olimpica_faliro.htm |title=Athens 21st Century – The Olympic Coastal Complex |accessdate=26 December 2008 |publisher=Athens-today.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the third time in [[Euroleague 2006-07|2007]] at the [[Olympic Indoor Hall]]. Events in other sports such as [[Track and field athletics|athletics]], volleyball, [[water polo]] etc., have been hosted in the capital's venues.

Athens is home to three European multi-sport clubs: [[Olympiacos CFP|Olympiacos]], [[Panathinaikos]], [[Athletic Union of Constantinople|AEK Athens]]. In [[Association football|football]], [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] have dominated the domestic competitions, [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] made it to the [[1971 European Cup Final]], while [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] is the other member of the [[P.O.K.|big three]]. These clubs also have basketball teams; [[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos]] and [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] are among the top powers in European basketball, having won the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] six times and three respectively, whilst [[AEK Athens B.C.|AEK Athens]] was the first Greek team to win a European trophy in any team sport.

Other notable clubs within Athens are [[Athinaikos]], [[Panionios]], [[Atromitos F.C.|Atromitos]], [[Apollon Smyrni F.C.|Apollon]], [[Panellinios G.S.|Panellinios]], [[Ethnikos Piraeus]], [[Maroussi BC|Maroussi BCE]] and [[Peristeri B.C.]]. Athenian clubs have also had domestic and international success in other sports.
{{wide image|Interior of OAKA Olympic Indoor Hall, Athens.jpg|align-cap=center|600px|Interior of the [[Nikos Galis Olympic Indoor Hall]]}}
The Athens area encompasses a variety of [[terrain]], notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a [[mountain range]]. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of miles of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on [[hiking|foot]] and [[Mountain biking|bike]].

Beyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include [[skiing]], [[rock climbing]], [[hang gliding]] and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.

==== Olympic Games ====

===== 1896 Summer Olympics =====
{{Main|1896 Summer Olympics}}
[[File:Kallimarmaron stadium.JPG|thumb|View of the [[Panathenaic Stadium]] (Kallimarmaro)]]
[[File:Castaigne - Fencing before the king of Greece, 1896 Summer Olympics.jpg|alt=|thumb|''Fencing before the [[George I of Greece|king of Greece]]'' at the [[1896 Summer Olympics]].]]
1896 brought forth the revival of the modern Olympic Games, by Frenchman [[Pierre de Coubertin]]. Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000&lt;ref name=tung2/&gt; and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the [[Kallimarmaro]] Stadium, and [[Zappeion]] were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], the same material used for construction of the [[Parthenon]].

===== 1906 Summer Olympics =====
{{Main|1906 Intercalated Games}}
The [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]], or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized Olympics, and were meant to be organized in Greece every four years, between the main Olympics. This idea later lost support from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] and these games were discontinued.

===== 2004 Summer Olympics =====
{{Main|2004 Summer Olympics}}
[[File:10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympics.jpg|thumb|10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympic Games]]
Athens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], to [[Atlanta]], United States.&lt;ref name=oly/&gt; It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.&lt;ref name=oly/&gt; Prior to this round, the cities of [[Buenos Aires]], Stockholm and [[Cape Town]] had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.&lt;ref name=oly/&gt;

During the first three years of preparations, the [[International Olympic Committee]] had expressed concern over the speed of construction progress for some of the new Olympic venues. In 2000 the Organising Committee's president was replaced by [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], who was the president of the original Bidding Committee in 1997. From that point forward, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace.

Although the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern [[urban planning|urban development]].&lt;ref name=olyy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |title=Athens bids farewell to the Games |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=29 March 2007 |work=CNN |publisher=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games. The games welcomed over 10,000 athletes from all 202 countries.&lt;ref name=olyy/&gt;

The 2004 Games were judged a success, as both security and organization worked well, and only a few visitors reported minor problems mainly concerning accommodation issues. The 2004 Olympic Games were described as ''Unforgettable, dream Games'', by IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]] for their return to the birthplace of the Olympics, and for meeting the challenges of holding the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=olyy/&gt; The only observable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some early events. Eventually, however, a total of more than 3.5&amp;nbsp;million tickets were sold, which was higher than any other Olympics with the exception of Sydney (more than 5&amp;nbsp;million tickets were sold there in 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&amp;folder=200&amp;article=13956 |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=30 March 2007 |title=Olympic ticket sales officially top 3.5-million mark |publisher=Embassy of Greece |author=Athens News Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232754/http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&amp;folder=200&amp;article=13956 |archivedate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Railways and ferry connections ====

Athens is the hub of the [[Hellenic Railways Organisation|country's national railway system]] (OSE), connecting the capital with major cities across Greece and abroad ([[Istanbul]], [[Sofia]] and [[Bucharest]]).The [[Port of Piraeus]] connects Athens to the numerous [[List of islands of Greece|Greek islands]] of the [[Aegean Sea]], with ferries departing, while also serving the cruise ships that arrive.

Two main motorways of Greece begin in Athens, namely the [[Motorway 1 (Greece)|A1]]/[[European route E75|E75]], which crosses through Athens's Urban Area from [[Piraeus]], heading north towards Greece's second largest city, [[Thessaloniki]]; and the [[Olympia Odos|A8]]/[[European route E94|E94]] heading west, towards [[Patras]], which incorporated the [[Greek National Road 8A|GR-8A]]. Before their completion much of the road traffic used the [[Greek National Road 1|GR-1]] and the [[Greek National Road 8|GR-8]].

Athens' Metropolitan Area is served by the motorway network of the [[Attiki Odos]] toll-motorway (code: [[Attiki Odos|A6]]). Its main section extends from the western industrial suburb of [[Eleusina|Elefsina]] to [[Athens International Airport]]; while two beltways, namely the Aigaleo Beltway (A65) and the Hymettus Beltway (A64) serve parts of western and eastern Athens respectively. The span of the Attiki Odos in all its length is {{convert|65|km|mi|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aodos.gr/article.asp?catid=12069&amp;tag=7275 Aodos.gr]  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest metropolitan motorway network in all of Greece.

Located on [[Panepistimiou Street]], the old campus of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]], the [[National Library of Greece|National Library]], and the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] form the "Athens Trilogy" built in the mid-19th century. Most of the university's workings have been moved to a much larger, modern campus located in the eastern suburb of [[Zografou]]. The second higher education institution in the city is the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic School]], found in Patission Street. This was the location where on 17 November 1973, more than 13 students were killed and hundreds injured inside the university during the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/25/newsid_2546000/2546297.stm |title=1973: Army deposes 'hated' Greek president |work=BBC News |accessdate=22 March 2009|date=25 November 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|military junta]] that ruled the nation from 21 April 1967 until [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|23 July 1974]].

Other universities that lie within Athens are the [[Athens University of Economics and Business]], the [[Panteion University]], the [[Agricultural University of Athens]] and the [[University of Piraeus]]. There are overall eleven state-supported Institutions of Higher (or Tertiary) education located in the Metropolitan Area of Athens, these are by chronological order: [[Athens School of Fine Arts]] (1837), [[National Technical University of Athens]] (1837), [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]] (1837), [[Agricultural University of Athens]] (1920), [[Athens University of Economics and Business]] (1920), [[Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences]] (1927), [[University of Piraeus]] (1938), [[Technological Educational Institute of Piraeus]] (1976), [[Technological Educational Institute of Athens]] (1983), [[Harokopio University]] (1990), [[School of Pedagogical and Technological Education]] (2002). There are also several other private ''colleges'', as they called formally in Greece, as the establishment of private universities is prohibited by the constitution. Many of them are accredited by a foreign state or university such as the [[American College of Greece]] and the [[University of Indianapolis – Athens Campus|Athens Campus]] of the [[University of Indianapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thought.de/|title=ΙδιωτικάΠανεπιστήμιαστην Ελλάδα – PrivateUniversities in Greece|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Basler Läckerli''' (also '''Leckerli''' or '''Läggerli''', ''lecker'' meaning "delicious" in [[German language|German]] and ''-li'' being a [[Diminutive#German|diminutive]] suffix) is a traditional hard [[spice]] [[biscuit]] originating from [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. It is made of [[honey]], [[hazelnuts]], [[almond]]s, [[candied peel]], and [[Kirsch]]. The flat baked dough is, when still hot, cut into rectangular pieces. It is then topped with a sugar glaze.

Basler Läckerli were originally created by local spice merchants over 700 years ago and is available year-round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Annika Mengisen |title=Holiday Shopping, Swiss Style |url=http://www.thestreet.com/funds/toponepercent/10325941.html |work=The Street |date=8 December 2006 |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413202712/http://www.thestreet.com/funds/toponepercent/10325941.html |archivedate=2009-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Buffalo wing''', in the [[cuisine of the United States]], is an unbreaded [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] wing section ([[Poultry#Cuts of poultry|flat or drumette]]) that is generally [[Deep frying|deep-fried]] then coated and/or dipped in a sauce consisting of a [[vinegar]]-based [[cayenne pepper]] [[hot sauce]] and melted [[butter]] prior to serving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Horwitz| first = Jeremy| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Chicken Wings, or, Why people Know About Buffalo| work = | publisher = Buffalo Chow.com| date = January 1, 2008| url = http://www.buffalochow.com/2008/01/chicken_wings_or_why_people_kn.html| doi = | accessdate = November 18, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091231030443/http://www.buffalochow.com/2008/01/chicken_wings_or_why_people_kn.html| archivedate = December 31, 2009| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicken Wings – A Hot Topic!

Buffalo wings have gained in popularity in the United States and abroad, with some North American restaurant chains featuring them as a main menu item.

It also describes other dishes, such as pizza, that are seasoned with the Buffalo-style sauce or a Buffalo flavor seasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banfield|first1=Kelsey|title=17 Hot &amp; Spicy Buffalo Sauce-Flavored Foods|url=https://www.babble.com/best-recipes/17-hot-spicy-buffalo-sauce-flavored-foods/|website=babble.com|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origin===

There are several different claims about the invention of Buffalo wings.&lt;ref name="geography.ccsu.edu"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.geography.ccsu.edu/harmonj/atlas/buffwing.htm| title = On the Wings of a Buffalo or "Mother Teressa's Wings"| accessdate = January 20, 2008| last = Harmon| first = John E. | authorlink = | coauthors =| date =| year =| month =| work =  Atlas of Popular Culture in the Northeastern United States | publisher = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1980/08/25/1980_08_25_082_TNY_CARDS_000331411?currentPage=1 | title = An Attempt To Compile A Short History of the Buffalo Chicken Wing | accessdate = 2008-01-22 | last = Trillin| first = Calvin | authorlink = | coauthors =| date =  August 25, 1980 | work =| publisher = The New Yorker Magazine| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the claims is that Buffalo wings were first prepared at the [[Anchor Bar]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], by Teressa Bellissimo, who owned the bar with husband Frank in 1964.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Primal Grill with [[Steven Raichlen]]'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], August 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At the time chicken wings were inexpensive and undesirable, primarily being used for [[Stock (food)|stock]] or [[soup]].&lt;ref name= Filippone/&gt;

Several versions of the story of the invention of the Buffalo wing have been circulated by the Bellissimo family and others including:

*Upon the unannounced, late-night arrival of their son, Dominic, with several of his friends from college, Teressa needed a fast and easy snack to present to her guests. It was then that she came up with the idea of [[deep frying]] chicken wings (normally thrown away or reserved for stock) and tossing them in cayenne hot sauce.&lt;ref name="geography.ccsu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.anchorbar.com/original.php| title = AnchorBar - Origins of the original Buffalo Chicken Wing| accessdate = January 6, 2008| publisher = AnchorBar.com| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080129092706/http://www.anchorbar.com/original.php| archivedate = January 29, 2008| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Filippone"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://homecooking.about.com/od/foodhistory/a/buffwinghistory.htm | title = Buffalo Wings History - The origins of Buffalo Chicken Wings| author = Peggy Trowbridge Filippone | accessdate = January 20, 2008| publisher = About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dominic Bellissimo (Frank and Teressa's son) told ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reporter [[Calvin Trillin]] in 1980: "It was Friday night in the bar and since people were buying a lot of drinks he wanted to do something nice for them at midnight when the mostly [[Catholic]] patrons would be able to eat meat again." He stated that it was his mother, Teressa, who came up with the idea of chicken wings.&lt;ref name="geography.ccsu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;
*There was mis-delivery of wings instead of backs and necks for making the bar's [[spaghetti]] sauce. Faced with this unexpected resource, Frank Bellissimo says that he asked Teressa to do something with them.&lt;ref name="geography.ccsu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

Although an article published about the Anchor Bar in a local newspaper during 1969 does not mention Buffalo wings, a local competitor of the Anchor Bar, [[Duff's Famous Wings]], began selling Buffalo wings in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galarneau|first1=Andrew Z.|title=At 50, the Buffalo-style chicken wing has conquered the world|url=http://buffalonews.com/2014/03/01/at-50-the-buffalo-style-chicken-wing-has-conquered-the-world/|accessdate=1 May 2017|publisher=The Buffalo News|date=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clemens|first1=Chris|title=Duff's Famous Wings – Buffalo, NY|url=http://exploringupstate.com/duffs-famous-wings-buffalo-ny/|website=ExploringUpstate.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Another claim is that a man named John Young, who moved to Buffalo from Alabama in 1948, began serving uncut chicken wings that were breaded, deep fried and served in his own special tomato based [[Mumbo sauce|"Mambo Sauce"]] at his Buffalo restaurant beginning in 1964.&lt;ref name="Janice"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Okun|first1=Janice|title=John Young Stakes His Claim To The Chicken Wing|url=http://buffalonews.com/1996/02/06/john-young-stakes-his-claim-to-the-chicken-wing/|accessdate=4 May 2017|publisher=The Buffalo News|date=6 February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to opening his restaurant he had a conversation with a boxer who traveled and in a later interview Mr. Young recalled: "He told me that there was a restaurant in Washington, D.C. that was doing a good business with wings and I decided to specialize".&lt;ref name="Janice"/&gt; In the same interview Young stated that the Anchor Bar didn't offer Buffalo wings as a regular menu item until 1974.&lt;ref name="Janice"/&gt; He registered the name of his [[restaurant]], John Young's Wings 'n Things, at the [[County (United States)|county]] [[courthouse]] before leaving the Buffalo area in 1970.&lt;ref name="geography.ccsu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.jamesbeard.org/about/press/newsdetails.php?news_id=24| title = James Beard Foundation | accessdate = January 20, 2008| last = | first =  | authorlink = | vauthors =| date =| year =| month =| work = THE 2003 JAMES BEARD FOUNDATION COCA-COLA AMERICA'S CLASSICS AWARDS| publisher = | pages = | archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20080103154411/http://www.jamesbeard.org/about/press/newsdetails.php?news_id=24| archivedate = January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, at the National Buffalo Wing Festival, held in Buffalo, New York, John Young's contributions were acknowledged when he was inducted into the festival's National Buffalo Wing Hall of Flame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buffalo Wing Hall Of Flame John Young "Wings and Things"|url=http://buffalowing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WingFest-2013-final.pdf|website=National Buffalo Wing Festival|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and popularity===
[[Image:Coast Guard buffalo chicken wings.jpg|thumb|175px|A cook preparing Buffalo wings]]
In 1977 the city of Buffalo issued an official proclamation celebrating Anchor Bar co-owner Frank Bellissimo declared July 29, 1977 to be Chicken Wing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Claiborne|first1=Craig|last2=Franey|first2=Pierre|title=Food; Winging It In Buffalo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/30/magazine/food-winging-it-in-buffalo.html|accessdate=30 April 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 30, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Buffalo wings gained in popularity as a [[bar food]] and [[appetizer]] across the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harmon|first1=John E.|title=On the Wings of a Buffalo or "Mother Teressa's Wings"|url=http://web.ccsu.edu/faculty/harmonj/atlas/buffwing.htm|website=Atlas of Popular Culture in the Northeastern United States|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large franchises specializing in Buffalo wings have emerged, notably [[Buffalo Wild Wings]] founded in 1982 and [[Hooter's]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlyle|first1=Erin|title=Buffalo Wild Wings and the triumph of the chicken wing|url=http://www.citypages.com/news/buffalo-wild-wings-and-the-triumph-of-the-chicken-wing-6746668|accessdate=5 May 2017|publisher=City Pages|date=9  March  2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonald's]] began selling [[List of McDonald's products#Former items|Mighty Wings]] as an optional item in 1990 at their restaurant locations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sozzi|first1=Brian|title=McDonald's Brings Back Mighty Wings|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/13548178/1/mcdonald-s-brings-back-mighty-wings.html|accessdate=5 May 2017|publisher=The Street|date=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, following four [[Super Bowl]] appearances by the [[Buffalo Bills]] football team, the [[Domino's]] pizza chain added Buffalo wings to their national menu, followed by [[Pizza Hut]] the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stromberg|first1=Joseph|title=A Brief History of the Buffalo Chicken Wing|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/a-brief-history-of-the-buffalo-chicken-wing-10260772/|website=Smithsonian.com|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Upton|first1=Emily|title=Why Buffalo Wings Are Called That|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/10/buffalo-wings-called/|website=Today I Found Out|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many areas of the United States chicken wing festivals are held with Buffalo wings being used in [[competitive eating]] events, such as at [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Wing Bowl]] and the [[National Buffalo Wing Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wing Festivals Across America in 2015|url=http://www.bringthewing.com/2014/11/wing-festivals-across-america-in-2015/|website=Bring the Wing.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also become commonplace for restaurants to offer a wing eating contest featuring a customer eating a certain number of wings, coated in their hottest sauce during a set period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chicken Wing-Eating Competitions Across America|url = http://tailgatefan.cbslocal.com/2015/04/30/chicken-wing-eating-competitions-across-america/|accessdate = 2015-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bars and restaurants intentionally create an extra-hot sauce for this purpose, and customers are usually rewarded with their picture posted on the restaurant's wall or website, a commemorative [[T-shirt]], a free meal or a combination of rewards for successfully completing the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wing Eating Challenges in Restaurants Across America|url=http://www.bringthewing.com/2012/04/wing-eating-challenges-in-restaurants-across-america/|website=Bring the Wing.com|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
===Chicken===
[[File:Chicken Wings made in a Wood-fired pizza oven.jpg|thumb|Roasted Chicken Wings]]
The chicken wings used for Buffalo wings are usually segmented into three parts with the end section of the wing, called the flapper or pointer, being discarded. Typically, the wings are deep-fried in oil, without breading or flour until they are well browned. Alternatively, they may be baked, grilled, or [[Grilling#Overhead grilling|broiled]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrow|first1=Cathy|title=These wings are called 'irresistible' for a reason|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/these-wings-are-called-irresistible-for-a-reason/2017/04/26/a23a6278-2918-11e7-be51-b3fc6ff7faee_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sauce===
[[Cayenne pepper]], [[hot sauce]] and melted butter or margarine are the base of the Buffalo wing sauce, which may be made mild, medium, or hot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pittman|first1=Christine|title=What's the Difference Between Hot Sauce and Wing Sauce|url=http://thecookful.com/difference-between-hot-sauce-wing-sauce/|website=The Cookful|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial ready-to-use wing sauce is made with varying levels of [[Pungency|spiciness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimmer|first1=Erin|title=Taste Test: Buffalo Wing Sauce|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/02/what-is-the-best-buffalo-wing-sauce-brand-texas-pete-anchor-bar-franks-red-crystal.html|website=Serious Eats|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooked chicken wings are placed in a bowl or pot and shaken to coat the wings completely covering them in sauce before serving.

===Service===

Traditionally, Buffalo wings are usually served with small sticks of [[celery]] and [[blue cheese]] dipping sauce on the side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saladino|first1=Emily|title=Why Do We Eat Celery with Buffalo Wings?|url=https://www.tastingtable.com/dine/national/why-do-we-eat-buffalo-wings-celery|website=Tasting Table|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sliced carrots or whole [[baby carrot]]s are often served with buffalo wings rather than the usual sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranch Is The Most Popular Wing Dip (POLL)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/30/best-wing-sauce-blue-cheese-ranch_n_2581566.html|publisher=Huffpost|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for China and Globalization (CCG)''' is a leading Chinese independent think tank based in [[Beijing]]. It is dedicated to the study of Chinese public policy and globalization, and conducts research in a wide range of social science disciplines, including global migration, foreign relations, international talent development, foreign trade and investment, homegrown MNCs and global governance.

Founded in 2008 by two prominent Chinese scholars, Dr. [[Wang Huiyao]] and Dr. [[Miao Lu]], CCG has grown into the largest independent think tank in China with headquarters in Beijing and offices in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Qingdao as well as representatives in major cities abroad, hiring nearly 100 in-house researchers and staff.

The think tank is co-chaired by three eminent Chinese: [http://en.ccg.org.cn/people/long-yongtu/ Long Yongtu], former Vice Minister of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and chief negotiator for China’s accession into the WTO; [[He Yafei]], former Vice Minister of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs; [[Ronnie Chan|Ronnie Chen]], Hong Kong tycoon and philanthropist. The advisory board represents a constellation of prominent figures from academia, business and policy-making communities at home and abroad.

According to the [http://repository.upenn.edu/think_tanks/12/ “2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index”] by the [[University of Pennsylvania]] Think Tank and Civil Society Program (TTCSP), CCG ranked 91th of the top think tanks worldwide. The TTCSP along with several Chinese academic institutions rank CCG as China’s premier independent think tank.

==Research==

CCG specializes in the research pertaining to Chinese development in relation to globalization. The main subjects include:

=== Global Talent ===

The research on global talent focuses on the development of Chinese and international talent, as well as the role of “returnees” on China’s economic and social progress, such as:

• [[Human migration|Migration]]

• [[Studying abroad]]

• Returnees

• Global talent

• Overseas Chinese

• Talent mobility

=== Chinese Enterprise Going Abroad ===

CCG contributes to the study of Chinese companies “going abroad” on the topics such as:

• Enterprise internationalization

• Cultivation of Global Talent

• [[Multinational companies|Multinational Companies in China]]

• [[Belt and Road Initiative]]

=== International Affairs ===

China is becoming a global player with its increasing influence in the Asia Pacific, Africa, and Latin America. CCG conducts research on China’s role in international affairs from economic, strategic and cultural aspects.

• [[Regional integration|Regional Integration]]

• Bilateral Relations

• [[Public diplomacy|Public Diplomacy]]

=== Urban Studies ===

Chinese cities that are undergoing urbanization drives need to attract foreign talent to help support their economic growth. CCG conducts research on China’s [[Urbanization in China|urbanization]] process, as well as challenges facing Chinese cities, such as [[air pollution]], sanitation, and [[water safety]].

• [[Sustainable development|Sustainable Development]]

=== Education ===

CCG’s research on education focuses on [[cultural integration]] and creation of an international educational community. We analyze how innovation impacts society and education, and identify the challenges and solution to promoting education innovation in China.

==Publications==

CCG publications include the monthly journals, China and Globalization Research, Policy Advisory Report and also the CCG Newsletter. CCG also issues reports of its major conferences and main activities. Articles also frequently appear in leading national and international magazines and newspapers such as the [[Financial Times]] and [[China Daily]].&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/video/2009-07/04/content_8384450.htm |title=Henry Wang Interview |publisher=chinadaily.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reports===

====Report on International Talents Strategy====
In June 2008, CCG participated in a long-term national talent planning research study in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Organization. CCG's specific area of focus was in International Talent Strategy and the center published a comprehensive report of their findings. The report analyzed China's situation in terms of competing for international talent, and included research on recent accomplishments, potentially sustainable competitive advantages and also existing problems. From this research it was possible to submit a series of policy-making recommendations.

====Report on the “Chinese Green Card” and Visa Issue====
On 3 September 2009, CCG experts were invited by the State Council Overseas Chinese Office to take part in the “Chinese Green Card and Visa Issue Roundtable”. Wang Huiyao, Director General of Center for China &amp; Globalization delivered a report on this issue that offers advice and suggestions for improving the global movements of talent.

====Annual Report on Chinese Talent Educated Abroad 2009====
The Annual Report on Chinese Talent Educated Abroad covers 60 years of Chinese talent educated overseas.

====Contemporary Chinese Returnees====
The Contemporary Chinese Returnees is a research series of returned Chinese scholars comprising eight books. Books in this series include Reflections of 100 Chinese Returnees, Move on Wall Street and Contemporary Chinese Returnees.

====Talent War====
This book by Wang Huiyao investigates a global "war" that has been fought for over 60 years for international talent. While this conflict does not involve bullets or soldiers, it has an unimaginable impact on the development of a nation. Wang Huiyao contends that a country's ability to develop and then retain its talent, will determine its future in the 21st century.

====Dreams from My Father: a Story of Race and Inheritance====
Dreams from My Father is a memoir by the 44th President of the United States, [[Barack Obama]]. It was first published in 1995 after Obama was elected the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, before his political career began. The CCG translated this book into Chinese and since then this copy of Obama's autobiography has sold over 250,000 copies in China.

==Events==

CCG hosts events in a range of sizes, including regular round-table and panel discussions as well as large-scale conferences being held in major cities across China.

The '''Chadian passport''' is issued to citizens of [[Chad]] for international travel. The Chadian passport is written in three languages; [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

As of 1 January 2017, Chadian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 51 countries and territories, ranking the Chadian passport 85th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Bhutanese, Chinese, Malian and Rwandan passports) according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Henley visa restrictions index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2017|url=https://henleyglobal.com/files/download/hvri/HP_Visa_Restrictions_Index_170301.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2017, citizens of Chad who held Chadian passports were banned from entering the [[United States of America]]. The reason was that Chadian authorities had run out of passport paper and were unable to submit sample passports to American authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keating|first1=Joshua|title=Finally, We Learn Why Chad Is on the Travel Ban List.

Two kings of the Corca, Dobhailen mac Gormghus, (died 885) and his son, Uathmarán mac Dobhailéin (died 920), were successive [[Kings of Luighne Connacht]]. Dobhailen was the [[eponym]] of the [[clan]] [[Devlin (surname)|Ó Dobhailen]] of [[Connacht]]. Later kings of the Corca descended from him included:

* ''M928 - Maol Da Bhonna mac Dobhailen, king of Luighne, and Muircheartach mac Eagra, king of Luighne, were slain.
* ''M944.9 - Domhnall mac Uathmharan mac Dobhailen, lord of Corca-Firtri, died.''

'''Defrage''' is an Estonian metal and rock band formed in 2007. 

The band has done numerous gigs in Estonia and won the [[MTV Eesti]] Award for Best Music Video in 2009 for "Save Us From Religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MTV «Eesti TOP 100» võitis Pärnu bändi DefRage video «Save Us From Religion».|url=http://www.elu24.ee/86701/mtv-eesti-top-100-voitis-parnu-bandi-defrage-video-save-us-from-religion|accessdate=2 August 2013|newspaper=Elu24.ee|date=25 February 2009|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known for selling their album in parking lots to raise money for their tours. &lt;ref name=ohtuleht&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohtuleht.ee/363836|title=Vabandust, et tülitame!

==History==

Defrage started to have their first band rehearsals in early 2007 when Kari (rhythm guitarist) got a response from Mikk (solo guitarist) to his advertisement on the website metal.ee "looking for a band members for an American style rock band". Soon after that Daniel (in early years bass guitar) and Sten (drums) joined for rehearsals which mainly took place in an old garage that belonged to Mikk's father. In the beginning the band just played and practiced together without any singer whom Kari looked for at the same time.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The band filmed a video for "Hotel Breakers" and released their album ''Jackal'' in January 2012.

After one year of touring in Europe, Defrage released their second album "The Sick Letter" in May 2013. Defrage performed on one of Europe's minor rock festivals called [[Nova Rock]], which takes place every June in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defrage (EE)|url=http://www.novarock.at/line_up/defrage|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defrage disbanded sometime in 2014, before the creation of a new band called [[Illumenium]], which includes former Defrage members Kari Kärner, Andre Kaldas and Kevin Presmann.. The new band continues with some previous Defrage songs, including "The Sick Letter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://elu24.postimees.ee/3019965/hotellitubade-hirmu-defrage-i-liikmed-loid-uue-bandi Hotellitubade hirmu Defrage'i liikmed lõid uue bändi].

'''del Carreto, Baron of Racalmuto''' were the descendents of [[Costanza di Chiaramonte di Racalmuto|Constanzia di Chiaramonte]] (1290 - 1350) the heiress and daughter of [[Federico di Chiaramonte]], Lord of [[Racalmuto]] a member of the prominent [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[Chiaramonte|Chiaramonte family]]. Constanzia  married [[Antonio I del Carretto Lord of Racalmuto|Antonio del Carretto]] on 11 November 1307. This marriage unified the [[del Caretto]] and Chiaramonte families bringing to the family the ancient Racalmuto titles.  For the following two centuries the del Carretto and Racalmuto names were united.

Constanzia died at [[Agrigento|Girgenti]] in 1350.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36305">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Geography of the ''Odyssey''}}
[[File:Homeric Greece-en.svg|thumb|upright=2.00|Map of [[Homer]]ic [[Greece]] based on the [[Catalogue of Ships]] in the ''[[Iliad]]'' (''right-click on map to enlarge'').]]

Events in the main sequence of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (excluding the narrative of [[Odysseus]]'s adventures) take place in the [[Peloponnese]] and in what are now called the [[Ionian Islands]] ([[Ithaca]] and its neighbours). Incidental mentions of [[Troy]] and its house, [[Phoenicia]], [[Egypt]], and [[Crete]] hint at geographical knowledge equal to, or perhaps slightly more extensive than that of the ''[[Iliad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Setting aside the geographical knowledge shown in the [[Catalogue of Ships]] and [[Trojan Battle Order]], which are extremely detailed and precise, but may have an orally transmitted history different from the remainder of the ''Iliad'' narrative.&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars both ancient and modern are divided as to whether or not any of the places visited by Odysseus (after [[Ismara|Ismaros]] and before his return to [[Ithaca]]) were real.

The geographer [[Strabo]] and many others came down squarely on the skeptical side: he reported what the great geographer [[Eratosthenes]] had said in the late third century BCE: "You will find the scene of Odysseus's wanderings when you find the cobbler who sewed up the bag of winds."&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 1.2.15, quoted by [[Moses I. Finley]], ''The World of Odysseus'', rev. ed. 1976:33. For the oxhide bag of winds, see "[[Aeolus]]", in ''Odyssey'' X.22 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography of the Telemachy ==
The journey of [[Telemachus]] to [[Pylos]] and [[Sparta]] no longer raises geographical problems. The location of Nestor's Pylos was disputed in antiquity; towns named Pylos were found in [[Elis]], [[Triphylia]] and [[Messenia]], and each claimed to be Nestor's home. [[Strabo]] (8.3), citing earlier writers, argued that Homer meant Triphylian Pylos. Modern scholarship, however, generally locates Nestor's Pylos in Messenia. The presence of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] ruins at the archaeological site of [[Ano Englianos]], or [[Palace of Nestor]], have greatly strengthened this view. The [[Linear B]] tablets found at the site indicate that the site was called ''Pu-ro'' ("Pylos") by its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson and Lazenby, p. 82. See also the section headed '''Atlantic Ocean theories'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification of Ithaca and neighboring islands ==
{{main|Homer's Ithaca}}
The geographical references in the ''Odyssey'' to Ithaca and its neighbors seem confused and have given rise to much scholarly argument, beginning in ancient times. Odysseus's Ithaca is usually identified with the island traditionally called ''Thiaki'' and now officially renamed Ithake, but some scholars have argued that Odysseus's Ithaca is actually [[Leukas|Leucas]], and others identify it with the whole or part of [[Cephalonia]]. Lately, Robert Bittlestone, in his book ''[[Odysseus Unbound]]'', has identified the [[Paliki]] peninsula on Cephalonia with Homeric Ithaca.

== Geography of Odysseus's narrative ==
[[File:Homer world map.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.50|"The World according to Homer", according to an 1895 map.]]
The geography of the ''Apologoi'' (the tale that Odysseus told to the [[Phaeacians]], forming books 9-12 of the ''Odyssey''), and the location of the Phaeacians' own island of [[Scheria]], pose quite different problems from those encountered in identifying Troy, [[Mycenae]], [[Pylos]] and Ithaca.
* The names of the places and peoples that Odysseus visits or claims to have visited are not recorded, either as historical or contemporary information, in any ancient source independent of the ''Odyssey''.
* What happens to Odysseus in these places, according to his narrative, belongs to the realm of the supernatural or fantastic (to an extent that is not true of the remainder of the ''Odyssey'').
* It can be doubted whether Odysseus's story is intended, within the general narrative of the ''Odyssey'', to be taken as true.
* We cannot know whether the poet envisaged the places on Odysseus' itinerary, and the route from each place to the next, as real.
* Even if the places were envisaged as real, the effects of [[coastal erosion]], [[silting]] and other geological changes over thousands of years can alter the landscape and seascape to the point where identification may be extremely difficult.

For these reasons, the opinions of later students and scholars about the geography of Odysseus's travels vary enormously. It has repeatedly been argued that each successive landfall, and the routes joining them, are real and can be mapped; it has been argued with equal conviction&lt;ref&gt;Recently by Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2008, ch. "Finding Neverland"; Lane summarizes the literature in notes and bibliography..&lt;/ref&gt; that they do not exist in the real world and never can be mapped.

=== Ancient identifications ===
Ancient sources provide a wealth of interpretations of Odysseus' wanderings, with a complex range of traditions which affect one another in various ways. Broadly speaking there are two dominant trends. One is that of [[Euhemerus|Euhemerist]] accounts, which re-wrote mythical stories without their fantastic elements, and were often seen as thereby recovering "historical" records. The other reflects the conventions of foundation myths, whereby stories of a city or institution being founded in the course of Odysseus' travels often came to have political significance.

Some identifications are common to both groups. The main distinctions between them are in how the identifications were passed down through the generations, and the uses to which they were put. The most standard identifications, which are rarely disputed in ancient sources, are

* land of the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] = [[Sicily]]&lt;ref&gt;Earliest sources for this identification: [[Euripides]]' play ''Cyclops'', set near [[Mount Etna]]; and [[Thucydides]] 6.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* land of the [[Laestrygonians]] = Sicily&lt;ref&gt;Earliest source for this identification: [[Thucydides]] 6.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* island of [[Aeolus (son of Hippotes)|Aeolus]] = one or more of the [[Aeolian Islands]] off Sicily's north coast&lt;ref&gt;Earliest source for this identification: [[Thucydides]] 3.88.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scheria, the land of the [[Phaeacians]] = Corcyra (modern [[Corfu]]), off the west coast of [[Greece]] and [[Albania]]&lt;ref&gt;Earliest source for this identification: [[Thucydides]] 1.25.4. It is notable that the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]] poem the ''[[Naupactia]]'' referred to Corcyra in the context of the story of [[Jason]], which was earlier in the mythic age than Odysseus, but does not seem to have identified it with Scheria (''Naupactia'' fr. 9 West).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ogygia, the island home of the nymph [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] = Gaudos, modern [[Gozo]], part of the [[Maltese archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 7.3.6, referencing [[Callimachus]]' account in relation to [[Euhemerus]]. Also, Bradford, Ernle (1963), ''Ulysses Found''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Euhemerist accounts ====
Euhemerist accounts are generally those found in writers on antiquarian subjects, geographers, scholars, and historians. The most important ancient sources are the 1st century geographer [[Strabo]], who is our source for information on [[Eratosthenes]]' and [[Polybius]]' investigations into the matter; and the novelisation of the [[Trojan War]] that goes under the name of [[Dictys of Crete]], which many later writers treated as an authentic historical record of the war.

The prototypes for this tradition are in the 5th century BC. [[Herodotus]] identifies the land of the [[lotus-eaters]] as a headland in the territory of the Gindanes tribe in [[Libya]], and [[Thucydides]] reports the standard identifications mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 4.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides 1.25, 3.88, 6.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus and Thucydides do not actively euhemerise, but simply take local myths at face value for the political importance they had at the time.&lt;ref&gt;On the political importance of Corcyra's identification with Scheria, see e.g. C.J. Mackie 1996, "Homer and Thucydides: Corcyra and Sicily", ''Classical Quarterly'' 46.1: 103-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euhemerist accounts become more prominent in [[Alexandria]]n scholarship of the [[Hellenistic period]]. [[Callimachus]] identifies Scheria as Corcyra, and also identifies [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]'s island with Gaudos (modern [[Gozo]], part of [[Malta]]).&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 7.3.6.&lt;/ref&gt; His student [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] also identifies Scheria as Corcyra in his epic the ''[[Argonautica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Argonautica'' 4.983ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollonius' successor as head of the [[library of Alexandria]], [[Eratosthenes]], wrote a detailed investigation into Odysseus' wanderings. Eratosthenes takes a cynical view, regarding Homer as an entertainer, not an educator: "You will find the scene of the wanderings of Odysseus when you find the cobbler who sewed up the bag of the winds."&lt;ref name="Strabo 1.2.15"&gt;Strabo 1.2.15.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that he refuses any and all identifications. He conjectures that [[Hesiod]]'s information about the wanderings (see below on Hesiod) came from historical inquiries that Hesiod had made.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 1.2.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd century BC poet-historian [[Apollodorus of Athens]] sympathises with Eratosthenes, believing that Homer imagined the wanderings as having taken place in a kind of fairyland in the Atlantic; he actively criticises the standard identifications in and around Sicily, and refuses to offer any identifications of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 1.2.37, 7.3.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd century BC historian [[Polybius]] discusses the wanderings in book 34 of his history. He refutes Apollodorus' idea that the wanderings were in the Atlantic on the basis of ''Odyssey'' 9.82, where Odysseus says that he sailed for nine days from [[Cape Malea]] in the [[Peloponnese]] to the land of the lotus-eaters: it would take much longer than nine days to reach the Atlantic. He accepts the standard identifications around Sicily, and is the earliest source to identify [[Scylla and Charybdis]] explicitly with the [[Strait of Messina]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 1.2.15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; He also identifies the land of the lotus-eaters as the island of [[Djerba]] (ancient Meninx), off the coast of [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 1.2.17.&lt;/ref&gt; Polybius is the most euhemerist source to this date: he justifies the description of Aeolus in the ''Odyssey'' as "king of the winds" on the grounds that Aeolus "taught navigators how to steer a course in the regions of the Strait of Messina, whose waters are ... difficult to navigate", and insists that the mythical elements in the wanderings are insignificant in comparison to the historical core.&lt;ref name="Strabo 1.2.15"/&gt;

[[Strabo]], living in the late 1st century BC and early 1st century AD, says that he tries to strike a balance between reading Homer as an entertainer and as a historical source.&lt;ref&gt;See especially 1.2.3, 1.2.17, 1.2.19.&lt;/ref&gt; He is Euhemerist to the extent that he believes that any hypothesis at all, no matter how outrageous, is more plausible than saying "I don't know";&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 1.2.37.&lt;/ref&gt; in this regard he accepts Polybius' arguments completely. Strabo offers the most detailed surviving set of identifications:

* Lotus-eaters: [[Djerba]], following Polybius (1.2.17)
* Cyclops: south-east Sicily, near [[Mount Etna|Etna]] and [[Lentini]] (1.2.9); also suggests that Homer "borrowed his idea of the one-eyed Cyclopes from the history of [[Scythia]], for it is reported that the Arimaspians are a one-eyed people" (1.2.10)
* Aeolus: [[Lipari]], among the [[Aeolian Islands]] north of Sicily
* Laestrygonians: south-east Sicily (1.2.9)
* land of the Cimmerians: the [[Bosporus]] (1.2.9)
* the Ocean: the [[Black Sea]] (ancient Pontus; 1.2.10)
* [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s: either Cape Faro, by the [[Strait of Messina]]; or Sirenussae, a headland in [[Italy]] between the [[Bay of Naples]] and the [[Gulf of Salerno]]; or [[Naples]] itself (1.2.12-13)
* Scylla and Charybdis: [[Strait of Messina]] (1.2.9, 1.2.16)
* [[Ogygia]] ([[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]'s island) and [[Scheria]]: "imagined in fantasy" as being in the Atlantic (1.2.18)

[[Plutarch]] agrees with Strabo on the location of Calypso's island of Ogygia in the Atlantic, and specifically west of [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Concerning the face which appears in the orb of the moon'', 941A-B.&lt;/ref&gt; He also repeats what [[Plato]] had described as a continent on the opposite side of the Atlantic ( [[North America]] ? ),&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Timaeus, 24E - 25A&lt;/ref&gt; and he adds that from this continent Ogygia was about 900 kilometres / 558 miles distant. Plutarch's account of Ogygia has created a lot of controversy as to whether he was referring to a real or a mythical place. [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] in his ''“Kepleri Astronomi Opera Omnia”'' estimated that “the great continent” was [[Americas|America]] and attempted to locate Ogygia and the surrounding islands. G. Mair in 1909 proposed that the knowledge of America came from [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] sailors who had reached the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Hamilton in 1934 indicated the similarities of Plutarch's account and [[Plato]]'s location of [[Atlantis]] on the Timaeus, 24E - 25A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/The_Face_in_the_Moon*/Introduction.html#ref49 Introductory notes] on Plutarch's ''"Concerning the Face Which Appears in the Orb of the Moon"'' at the [[Loeb Classical Library]], particularly notes on p21, p22 and p23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources offer miscellaneous details. The ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Library]]'' wrongly attributed to Apollodorus summarises most of the accounts given above. [[Aristonicus of Alexandria|Aristonicus]], a contemporary of Strabo's, wrote a monograph ''On the wanderings of Menelaus'', which influenced Strabo's own discussion.

Finally, the ''Ephemeris'' attributed to [[Dictys of Crete]], who claims to have been present at the Trojan War, was probably written in the 1st century CE or perhaps a little earlier. It falls into a tradition of anti-Homeric literature, based on the supposition that Homer got most things about the Trojan War wrong by making virtuous people look like villains, and vice versa. It is important because later historians took Dictys as a historical record, including [[Sisyphus of Cos]], [[John Malalas]], [[Georgios Kedrenos|George Cedrenus]], [[John of Antioch]], and others. Many Western mediaeval writers also accepted Dictys (in the Latin summary by Lucius Septimius) as the definitive account of the Trojan War.

According to Dictys, Odysseus fled from Troy after being accused of murdering [[Aias]]. He first went north to the [[Black Sea]] for a while; he sacked the Ciconian town of [[Ismara|Ismarus]] in [[Thrace]] on his way back. After visiting the lotus-eaters he went to Sicily, where he encountered three (or four) brothers, Antiphates, Cyclops, and Polyphemus (and possibly Laestrygon, according to Septimius), who each ruled a portion of the island. Odysseus and his men were mistreated by each of these kings in turn. Notably, they were imprisoned by Polyphemus when one of Odysseus' men fell in love with Polyphemus' daughter (Arene or Elpe) and tried to kidnap her; but they escaped. They passed through the [[Aeolian Islands]], but the surviving accounts of Dictys do not give specific locations for the rest of the wanderings. Malalas' account of Dictys, however, tells us that Circe and Calypso were sisters ruling over neighbouring islands; that Odysseus visited a lake called Nekyopompos ("guide of the dead") near the sea, whose inhabitants were seers; that he passed some rocks called the Seirenidai; and Cedrenus' account seems to identify Scheria with Corfu, or at least an island near Ithaca.&lt;ref&gt;This summary is based on a comparison of Septimius (5.15, 6.5) with Malalas (5.114-122 Dindorf).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Foundation myths ====
Numerous places in Italy and northern Greece also had aetiological legends about cities and other institutions founded by Odysseus on his various travels. Among these foundation myths the continuation of Odysseus's travels told in the ''[[Telegony]]'' is at least as important as the wanderings reported in the ''Odyssey''.

The earliest record of a foundation myth connecting Odysseus with Italy is the lines surviving in [[Hesiod]]'s ''Theogony'' (1011ff.), which report that Odysseus and Circe had two sons Agrius and [[Latinus]], who ruled over the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] (''Tyrsenoi''). Latinus is an important figure in many early Italian myths. The lines are not in fact Hesiodic, but they are probably no later than the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;J. Poucet 1985, ''Les origines de Rome'' (Brussels), p. 46 n. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Cornell 1995, ''The Beginnings of Rome'' (London), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

E.D. Phillips gives a very full treatment of myths that placed Odysseus and [[Telegonus]], his son by Circe, in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;E.D. Phillips 1953, "Odysseus in Italy", ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 73: 53-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern views ===
[[File:Odyssey (Butler) Map.png|thumb|upright=1.50|Map of Ulysses' travels from [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Butler's]] English translation of ''The Odyssey'' (1900).]]

==== Imaginary places ====
The view that Odysseus's landfalls are best treated as imaginary places is probably held by the majority of classical scholars today.

The modern Greek Homerist [[Ioannis Kakridis]] may be compared with Eratosthenes in his approach to the problem. He argued that the Odyssey is a work of poetry and not a travel log. To attempt a quick outline of Kakridis's views, it is useless to try to locate the places mentioned in Odysseus' narrative on the map; we cannot confuse the narrative of Odyssey with history unless we believe in the existence of gods, giants and monsters. Kakridis admits that one may indeed ask what real locations inspired these imaginary places, but one must always bear in mind that geography is not the main concern either of Odysseus (as narrator) or of the poet.&lt;ref&gt;''Ελληνική Μυθολογία, vol. 5: The Trojan War'' (1986) Ekdotike Athenon, Athens. Kakridis compares the effort to locate Circe's island to locating the hut of the [[Snow White|seven dwarves]].&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Merry and Riddell, in their late 19th century school edition of the ''Odyssey'', state the following opinion: "Throughout these books [books 9-12] we are in a wonderland, which we shall look in vain for on the map".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stanford|1947|vol=1|p=352}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. B. Stanford]] in his mid 20th century edition comments as follows on book 9 lines 80-81 (where Odysseus says that he met storms off [[Cape Malea]] near the island of [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]]): "These are the last clearly identifiable places in O.'s wanderings. After this he leaves the sphere of Geography and enters Wonderland ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stanford|1947|vol=1|p=351}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, while frequently referring to ancient opinions on the location of Odysseus's adventures, Stanford makes little or no reference to modern theories.

[[Robin Lane Fox]]&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2008, ch. "Finding Neverland" p.170ff..&lt;/ref&gt; observes of [[Euboea]]n Greek settlements in Sicily and Italy, "During their first phase in the West, c. 800-740, stories of mythical heroes were not already sited at points along the coast of Italy or Sicily. It was only later that such stories became located there, as if mythical heroes had been driven westward or fled from Asia while leaving the sack of Troy." The heroic legends, including an Odyssean geography, served to attach newly founded western communities "to a prestigious ancestry in the Greeks' mythical past." Fox notes that even [[Circe]] found a home on "[[Mount Circeo|Monte Circeo]]" between Rome and Cumae: "but this association began at the earliest in the later sixth century BC. The Etruscan king [[Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin the Proud]] (''c.'' 530-510) was credited with the settlement and in due course the very 'cup' of Odysseus was shown at the site."&lt;ref&gt;Fox 2008:173, noting Livy i.56.2; Polybius iii.22,11, and Strabo v.3.6 and commentaries.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The western Mediterranean ====
By contrast with these views, some recent scholars, travelers and armchair travelers have tried to map Odysseus's travels. Modern opinions are so varied in detail that for convenience they need to be classified, as do the ancient ones. This article deals first with those who believe, as did many ancient authors, that the hero of the ''Odyssey'' was driven west or south-west from Cape Malea and, more than nine years later, returned from the west to his native Ionian islands: his landfalls are therefore to be found in the western Mediterranean.

For a long time the most detailed study of Odysseus's travels was that of the French Homeric scholar [[Victor Bérard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bérard|1927–1929}}; {{harvp|Bérard|1933}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although adopting the general frame of reference of the ancient commentators, Bérard differed from them in some details. For Bérard the land of the Lotus-Eaters was [[Djerba]] off southern Tunisia; the land of the Cyclopes was at [[Posillipo]] in [[Italy]]; the island of Aeolus was [[Stromboli]]; the Laestrygonians were in northern [[Sardinia]]; Circe's home was [[Monte Circeo]] in Lazio; the entrance to the Underworld was near [[Cumae]], just where Aeneas found it in the ''[[Aeneid]]''; the Sirens were on the coast of [[Lucania]]; Scylla and Charybdis were at the [[Strait of Messina]]; the Island of the Sun was [[Sicily]]; the homeland of Calypso was at the [[Straits of Gibraltar]]. From there Odysseus's route took him to Scherie, which Bérard, like so many of his ancient predecessors, identified with [[Corcyra]].

Bérard's views were taken as standard in the 1959 ''Atlas of the Classical World'' by A. A. M. van der Heyden and [[H. H. Scullard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classics.upenn.edu/myth/homer/media/odybig.jpg See map].&lt;/ref&gt; They were adopted in whole or in part by several later writers. Michel Gall, for example, followed Bérard throughout except that he placed the Laestrygonians in southern [[Corsica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lessing|1970}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ernle Bradford had meanwhile added some new suggestions: the land of the Cyclopes was around [[Marsala]] in western Sicily; the island of Aeolus was [[Ustica]] off Sicily; Calypso was on [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bradford|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Obregons, in ''Odysseus Airborne'', follow Bradford in some identifications but add several of their own. The Lotus Eaters are in the [[Gulf of Sidra]]; the Cyclops and Aeolus are both to be found in the [[Balearic Isles]]; the island of Circe is [[Ischia]] in the Bay of Naples; most unexpectedly, Scherie is [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Obregon|1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Translator [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] developed a controversial theory that the ''Odyssey'' came from the pen of a young [[Sicily|Sicilian]] woman, who presents herself in the poem as [[Nausicaa]], and that the scenes of the poem reflected the coast of [[Sicily]], especially the territory of [[Trapani]] and its [[Aegadian Islands|nearby islands]]. He described the "evidence" for this theory in his ''The Authoress of the Odyssey'' (1897) and in the introduction and footnotes to his prose translation of the ''Odyssey'' (1900). [[Robert Graves]] elaborated on this hypothesis in his novel ''[[Homer's Daughter]]''.

==== Around Greece ====
A minority view is that the landfalls of Odysseus were inspired by places on a much shorter itinerary along the coast of Greece itself. One of the earliest to suggest any locations here was the 2nd century AD geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] who, in his ''[[Description of Greece]]'', suggested that the [[nekyia]] took place at the river [[Acheron]] in north west Greece, where the [[Necromanteion]] was subsequently built.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''[[Description of Greece]]'': 1.17.5 "Near [[Cichyrus]] is a lake called [[Acherusia]], and a river called [[Acheron]]. There is also [[Cocytus]], a most unlovely stream. I believe it was because Homer had seen these places that he made bold to describe in his poems the regions of Hades, and gave to the rivers there the names of those in [[Thesprotia]]."&lt;/ref&gt; However the location was overlooked or dismissed by many subsequently, until the archaeologist [[Sotirios Dakaris]] excavated the site, beginning in 1958. He found evidence of sacrifices to the dead that matched Homer's description of those made by Odyssesus.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderpool, Eugene "News Letter from Greece" in ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 65, No. 3 (Jul., 1961), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the location was accepted by others as that described by Homer.&lt;ref&gt;Besonen, Mark R., Rapp, George(Rip) and Jing, Zhichun "The Lower Acheron River Valley: Ancient Accounts and the Changing Landscape" in ''Hesperia Supplements'', Vol. 32, ''Landscape Archaeology in Southern Epirus, Greece'' 1 (2003), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Severin|1987}} page 193&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EFS highres STS066 STS066-101-39.JPG|thumb|250px|The Ambracian Gulf and the island of [[Lefkada|Levkas]] (foreground, centre), around which Severin suggested locations for the Sirens, the Wandering Rocks, Scylla, Charybdis and the island of Helios's cattle.]]

Working on the assumption that the discoveries at the Acheron could challenge the traditional assumptions about the ''Odyssey''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s geography, [[Tim Severin]] sailed a replica Greek sailing vessel (originally built for his attempt to retrace the steps of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]) along the "natural" route from [[Troy]] to [[Ithaca]], following the sailing directions that could be teased out of the ''Odyssey''. Along the way he found locations at the natural turning and dislocation points which, he claimed, agreed with the text much more closely than the usual identifications. However, he also came to the conclusion that the sequence of adventures from Circe onwards derived from a separate itinerary to the sequence that ended with the Laestrygonians and was possibly derived from the stories of the [[Argonauts]]. He placed many of the later episodes on the north west Greek coast, near the [[Acheron]]. Along the way he found on the map Cape Skilla (at the entrance to the [[Ambracian Gulf]]) and other names that implied traditional links with the ''Odyssey''. Severin agrees with the common opinion that the Lotus Eaters are in North Africa (although he placed them in modern [[Libya]] rather than [[Tunisia]]) and that Scherie is Corcyra.&lt;ref name="harvp|Severin|1987"&gt;{{harvp|Severin|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key part of Severin's thesis is that whilst the text of the ''Odyssey'' contains many place names to the east and south of Greece, there are very few identifiable references to places to the west. As a result, he questions whether the western Mediterranean was known about at the time the original legends emerged (which he estimated to be some centuries before Homer composed the poem) and so consequently he doubted whether the stories had their origins there. In addition he noted that the Acheron is marked on the map, but traditionally ignored, whilst in the ''[[Argonautica]]'' of [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] the Argonauts' home voyage took them into the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea]]s, corresponding to a north west Greek location for many of the later adventures.&lt;ref name="harvp|Severin|1987"/&gt;

==== Atlantic Ocean and other theories ====
Strabo's opinion (mentioned above) that Calypso's island and Scherie were imagined by the poet as being "in the Atlantic Ocean" has had significant influence on modern theorists. [[Henriette Mertz]], a 20th-century author, argued that Circe's island is [[Madeira]], Calypso's island one of the [[Azores]], and the intervening travels record a discovery of North America: Scylla and Charybdis are in the [[Bay of Fundy]], Scherie in the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mertz|1964}}; [http://www.ancientgr.com/Unknown_Hellenic_History/images/Odysseas2.gif see map].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:it:Enrico Mattievich|Enrico Mattievich]] of UFRJ, Brazil, proposed that Odysseus's journey to the Underworld takes place in South America. The river [[Acheron]] is the Amazon; after a long voyage upstream Odysseus meets the spirits of the dead at the [[Pongo de Manseriche|confluence]] of the [[Río Ucayali|rio Santiago]] and [[Marañón River|rio Marañon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mattievich|1992}}; [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/sample_image/amaz3.jpg&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:04:27 see map]. Mattievich is a physicist at Rio de Janeiro University.&lt;/ref&gt; Two centuries ago, Charles-Joseph de Grave argued that the Underworld visited by Odysseus was the islands at the mouth of the [[river Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Grave|1806}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A more extreme view, that the whole geography of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''Odyssey'' can be mapped on the coasts of the northern Atlantic, occasionally surfaces. According to this, Troy is in southern England, Telemachus's journey is in southern Spain, and Odysseus was wandering the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cailleux|1879}}; {{harvp|Wilkens|1990}}; [http://www.trojan-war.co.uk/trojan-war.jpg see map]. Wilkens supposes that the oral poetry underlying the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' was originally [[Celtic peoples|Celtic]] (see ''[[Where Troy Once Stood]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a recent publication argues that Homeric geography is to be found in the sky, and that the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' can be decoded as a star map.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Johnson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gospodin Franjo''''' is a novel by Slovenian author [[Fran Maselj - Podlimbarski]]. It was first published in 1913. The author incorporates an overt message in support of [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav]] union by having his protagonist sympathize with [[Slovenia|Slovenian]] culture and come to hate the boorish occupiers in [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]]-occupied [[Bosnia]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrew Wachtel |coauthors= |authorlink= |title=Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation: Literature and Cultural Politics in Yugoslavia |year=1998 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location= |pages=61-62 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnISZNM6X6EC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22Gospodin+Franjo%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yDntU4v2O5OdyASbm4HQCA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gospodin%20Franjo%22&amp;f=false |isbn=9780804731812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Living monument''' ({{lang-bs| Živi spomenik}}, {{lang-sr|Живи споменик )}} is commemorations to the victims of past war in the former Yugoslavia organizated by [[Association for Social Research and Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udik.org/sarajevo/the-living-monument-a-unique-monument-to-the-victims-of-wars-in-former-yugoslavia/?lang=en|title=The Living Monument a unique Monument to the victims of wars in Former Yugoslavia – UDIK|publisher= udik.org|date=26 October 2014 |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living monument is [[Edvin Kanka Cudic]]'s idea of dealing with the past marking the anniversary of the crime, "disturbing" and recalling, so the public condemn the crime. In this way, the crime is visible in public, activists build monument with their body and show that the monument is built by the human body and thinking about the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://informativa.ba/2015/10/25/udik-odao-pocast-zrtvama-stradalim-na-kazanima-vazno-je-sjecati-se|title= UDIK odao počast žrtvama stradalim na Kazanima: Važno je sjećati se – Informativa|publisher= informativa.ba|date=25 October 2015 |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevotimes.com/?p=86954|title=Performance in Memory of Kazani: Pay Tribute to all Victims! – Sarajevo Times|publisher= sarajevotimes.com|date=26 October 2015 |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Democratic Front''' is a progressive [[political party]] in [[Botswana]] without parliamentary representation. Led by [[Dick Bayford]], it split away from the [[Botswana National Front]] in 2003. It won 0.78% of the popular votes at the last elections. After its poor performance in the 2004 general elections the party has since joined forces with Botswana's third largest party Botswana Congress party.

'''Radio Farda''' is the Iranian branch of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]-funded ''[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]'' (RFE/RL) external broadcast service. It broadcasts 24 hours a day in the [[Persian Language|Persian]] language from its headquarters in the district [[Hagibor]] of [[Prague, Czech Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;Radio Farda Official Website. http://www.rferl.org/section/Iran/156.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Farda first aired December 2002. Radio Farda broadcasts political, cultural, social, and art news with an emphasis on [[Iran]]. The name "Farda" means "tomorrow" in Persian. Radio Farda's broadcasts have been continually blocked by Iranian authorities over the history of its programming.&lt;ref&gt;Radio Farda Fact Sheet Website Page. http://www.rferl.org/info/Iran/186.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Launched in December 2002 as the successor to RFE/RL's Persian Service, Radio Farda advances the goals of U.S. foreign policy providing what it claims is an "objective and accurate news and information to counter state censorship and ideology-based media coverage". Radio Farda's new website was launched in 2006 and receives over 3 million page views every month.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/|title=Radio Free Europe/Radio Free Liberty|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio Farda==

Jay Solomon of the [[Wall Street Journal]] published a feature story on the challenges Radio Farda faces from an increasingly repressive [[Iranian regime]] as well as those in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] who seek a tougher line on Iran. A few challenges he highlights are Radio Farda journalists being unjustly convicted of crimes against the state, and millions of dollars spent on jamming Radio Farda broadcasts.   He also goes into detail about the fine line Radio Farda must walk to present itself as objective and accurate news source to its audience even though it is congressionally funded through the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]].&lt;ref&gt;Jay Solomon, The Wall Street Journal http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121332284643270593.html?mod=sphere_ts&amp;mod=sphere_wd&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Iranian-American]] journalist working for Radio Farda, Parnaz Azima, was banned from leaving Iran after her trip to the country. She had entered Iran to visit her ailing mother. She was jailed in May 2007 and released in August.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/world/middleeast/05tehran.html Iran Permits Journalist to Go], September 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Her passport was returned to her on a 550,000 [[U.S. Dollar]] bail.

According to Iason Athanasiadis of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', the Prague-headquartered Radio Farda was at first "tolerated" by the Islamic Republic, unlike "the Washington-based Voice of America", and "regularly interviewed Iranian politicians".&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0210/Iran-widens-journalist-crackdown-before-demonstrations Iran widens journalist crackdown before demonstrations], Iason Athanasiadis, February 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on February 7, 2010, the public relations office of the Ministry of Intelligence announced the arrest of seven journalists described as "elements of a counter-revolutionary Zionist satellite station" and in the "official pay" of US intelligence organizations. They were later identified as working for the US-funded Radio Farda.&lt;ref name="CSM"/&gt; Radio Farda's director, Armand Mostofi, told [[CNN]] it has no employees inside Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/02/07/iran.radio/ Report: Iran cites CIA in radio arrests], February 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Radio Farda was established in 2003 as a joint effort of RFE/RL and [[Voice of America]] (VOA). In 2007, the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG) decided to consolidate all of Radio Farda's operations under RFE/RL. Then in July 2008, RFE/RL assumed sole responsibility for all Radio Farda programming.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;

In 2009 Radio Farda's SMS system, [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] profiles were launched. Farda's audience sends thousands of voice, text and e-mail messages and comments frequently on the website and Facebook page. Radio Farda Facebook page has over 25,000 friends.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;

Following two weeks of large-scale protests during the June 12th Iranian elections authorities severely restricted the broadcasts of RFE/RL's Persian Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Iranian_Government_Steps_Up_Jamming_of_Radio_Farda/1763761.html|title=Iranian Government Steps Up Jamming of Radio Farda|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being one of the least free media environments in the world, Iran ranks 185th out of 195 in Freedom House's "Freedom of the Press 2009" report, behind countries like [[Sudan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Tajikistan]]. In the wake of mass public protests following June's disputed presidential elections, the Iranian government stepped up its efforts to control internet services and other forms of electronic communication, including broadcasts from Radio Farda, which remain illegal in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Freedom House 2008 Freedom of the Press World Ranking http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=442&amp;year=2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

Radio Farda web editor Fred Petrossians won a media award from Think Social for an internet-based project he co-founded that seeks to spread awareness of bloggers' rights in Iran and other countries with unfree media.&lt;ref&gt;Think Social {{cite web |url=http://think-social.org/awards/2009-winners |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413174101/http://think-social.org/awards/2009-winners |archivedate=2010-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian-born Radio Farda journalist Ahmad Rafat, now a well-known reporter based in Italy, has been honored for his more than 30 years of work advocating press freedom and exposing human rights abuses. The 2008 Ilaria Alpi award was presented by the Italian chapter of Reporters Without Borders to Rafat at a June 7 ceremony in [[Riccione]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://payvand.com/news/08/jun/1157.html|title=Iranian-born Journalist Wins Award for Press Freedom Advocacy|website=payvand.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1492">The '''Special Organisation''' ({{lang-fr|Organisation spéciale or organization secret}}) was a secret [[paramilitary]] organisation in colonial [[Algeria]], founded by Mohamed Belouizdad of the [[Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties]] (MTLD) in 1947 to prepare for armed struggle against [[France]], which ruled Algeria as a [[colony]] since 1830. The turn towards [[guerrilla warfare]] was in large part encouraged by the reactions to the [[Sétif massacre]] in 1945, and other examples of violent repression, which had convinced many Algerian activists that peaceful political work would be pointless.

The OS had around 1500-2000 members at its peak, and spawned the groups that would later form the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]]; this group, in turn, became the leading force in the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–1962), and later Algeria's single ruling party until 1989.

The OS was dismantled by French police in 1951, and many members imprisoned. Only the units in [[Aurès]] and [[Kabylie]] remained active at the time.

'''The Independents''' ({{lang-de|Die Unabhängigen}}; abbreviated '''DU''', meaning "''YOU''" in German), is a [[right-wing populist]]&lt;ref name=Welle/&gt;&lt;ref name="Politico2017"/&gt; [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] [[List of political parties in Liechtenstein|political party]] in [[Liechtenstein]]. In the [[Liechtenstein parliamentary election, 2013|2013 parliamentary election]], the first they contested, they won 29,740 votes (15.3%) and four seats in the [[Landtag of Liechtenstein|Landtag]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?ressort=liechtenstein&amp;source=lv&amp;id=15989 Landtagswahlen für 2013 festgelegt] Liechtensteiner Vaterland, 21 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; DU is headed by former [[Patriotic Union (Liechtenstein)|Patriotic Union]] parliamentarian [[Harry Quaderer]].

International commentators suggested that the party had benefited from [[protest vote]]s against [[austerity]] measures.&lt;ref name="France24"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Independent party rattles Liechtenstein vote|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130203/new-independent-party-rattles-liechtenstein-vote|work=GlobalPost|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=3 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721203324/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130203/new-independent-party-rattles-liechtenstein-vote|archivedate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APwire"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/02/03/politics-in-tiny-liechtenstein-shaken-up-by-surprise-election-success.html | title=Politics in tiny Liechtenstein shaken up by surprise election success of independents |work=Fox News |agency=Associated Press |date=February 3, 2013 | accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
DU is not a party in the traditional sense, having incorporated as a party solely to take advantage of the financial and political rights associated with that status; its platform calls for Members of the Landtag to be able to vote based on their own convictions rather than party pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.du4.li/ueber-uns/|publisher=Die Unabhängigen|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Leiden University]] political science professor Wouter Veenendaal, the DU has an ideology "similar to that of the [[Progressive Citizens' Party]] and the [[Patriotic Union (Liechtenstein)|Patriotic Union]] but its style is brasher."&lt;ref name="Politico2017"/&gt;

In 2015 the party called for Liechtenstein to reject the [[European Union]]'s proposed resettlement of refugees, specifically stating that the EU policies "led by [[Angela Merkel|Merkel]]'s Germany" were absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quaderer|first1=Harry|title=Landtag befasst sich mit Flüchtlingspolitik|url=https://www.du4.li/aussenpolitik/landtag-befasst-sich-mit-fluechtlingspolitik/|website=Die Unabhängigen|accessdate=19 September 2017|language=de-DE|date=5 October 2015|quote=Was für eine EU-Aussenpolitik ist das, die wir da unterstützen, wenn wir diesem absurden EU-Flüchtlings-Quoten-Mechanismus beitreten? Die EU, angeführt von Merkel-Deutschland, scheint unfähig, ihren Einfluss im Nahen Osten geltend zu machen und auf einen Frieden hinzuwirken.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tobelo''' is a town and also a district on the eastern [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Halmahera]]. It is the capital of the regency (''kabupaten'') of [[North Halmahera]], part of the province of [[North Maluku]].&lt;ref&gt;Hedman, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The city was formalised as the capital of North Halmahera in the district elections held in 2004. It has a population of approximately 33,700.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.malutpost.co.id/en/daerah/halut/item/7323-penduduk-halut-190955-jiwa|title=Penduduk Halut 190.955 Jiwa|website=portal.malutpost.co.id|access-date=2016-05-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509133441/http://portal.malutpost.co.id/en/daerah/halut/item/7323-penduduk-halut-190955-jiwa|archivedate=2016-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A palm tree lined coastal road connects Tobelo to [[Galela]]. The town is predominantly [[Christian]] and a [[Protestant Church]] has existed in Tobelo since at least 1924.

==Religion==
[[Muslims]] and Christians had lived amicably in this town of North Halmahera from the 16th century. However, [[North Maluku]] province has a Muslim majority. The coastal road from [[Galela]] to Tobelo passes through neighboring Muslim and Christian villages. Living peacefully, these two communities followed the local cultural tradition of the ''Hibua Lamo'' (a pact between Muslims and Christians to live together without aggressive designs on each other and cooperating on all matters of mutual interest).&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YdLRVGlmvbcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=Tobelo+North+Maluku&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I_8ZTL7MFM6Ocauw8foJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tobelo%20North%20Maluku&amp;f=false|title=Ethno-religious violence in Indonesia: from soil to God|last=Wilson|first=Chris|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=0-415-45380-1|pages=96–99|accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence broke out in Tobelo in December 1999.

Online: http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-69-jan-mar-2002/the-aftermath-of-civil-war-3007422&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reconciliation efforts at the district level worked for some time in preventing any clashes and assuage hurt feelings. The religious violence, which simmered in January 1999 in Ambon culminated in rioting in Tobelo by end of December 1999. This rioting was further triggered by the fleeing of several thousand Christians{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} from [[Central Halmahera]], and Tobelo had turned into a [[refugee camp]]. Though the rioting has been quelled, the mistrust between the two communities prevails.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Galela District with its own language is another place where remnants of strife (burnt out churches and mosques) between the religious groups are still seen with military checkposts established to prevent any further disturbances in the region.&lt;ref name="Witton"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmDYLxcPDPoC&amp;pg=PA830&amp;dq=Tobelo+North+Maluku&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I_8ZTL7MFM6Ocauw8foJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Tobelo%20North%20Maluku&amp;f=false|title=Indonesia|last=Witton|first=Patrick|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2003|isbn=1-74059-154-2|pages=830–831|author2=Mark Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ultimate analysis, it is reported that the sectarian violence in 1999–2000 had resulted in 2000 Muslim deaths in Maluku and a population displacement of 200,000 Muslim people in the region. Tobelo was the worst affected as over 100,000 Muslim people were from Tobelo and villages to its south, who fled to the island of [[Ternate]] and [[Morotai]] during early 2000. Nearly 70% of them returned subsequently as the situation was controlled.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;ref name= Hedman&gt;{{Cite book|last= Hedman |first= Eva-Lotta E.|title= Conflict, violence, and displacement in Indonesia|work=Old Spirits and new names|page=281|accessdate=2010-06-18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUDii8kvQYAC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=History+of+Tobelo+town+in+Indonesia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YCuHEILexq&amp;sig=9BkCCxeZolNMFT7_WGvKwSmA_GM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BzIbTLvzD8q3rAeGtvmXDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20Tobelo%20town%20in%20Indonesia&amp;f=false|publisher= SEAP Publications|year= 2008|isbn=0-87727-745-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a result of violence in 1999–2000, the area is clearly demarcated into Muslim and Christian villages.

There is a discerned process of peace building emerging between the two communities now.&lt;ref name=Harper&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiainstitute.unimelb.edu.au/programs/indonesian/indonews07_02.pdf|format=pdf|title=Theyears of Travelling Adventurously|pages =3–4|author=Brioni harper|accessdate=2010-06-18|publisher= Asian Institute|date=May–June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhabitants of Tobelo are non-Austronesian–speaking people.&lt;ref name=Coppet&gt;{{Cite book|last=Coppet|first= Daniel de|title= Understanding rituals|pages=74–76|accessdate=2010-06-18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZawOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=Flora+in++Tobelo+Island&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LTd028ZZRm&amp;sig=PqbKxTLxYwuHM94wrzShoIXbCNE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qKIbTM-KIYqzrAfJqqmtDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher= Routledge|year=1992|isbn= 0-415-06121-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobelo's predominant Christian character is expressed colourfully at [[Christmas]] with bamboo poles arching over the side of the roads hung with lights and multi-coloured flags. At Easter, local church congregations hold a competition to see who can create the best Easter garden.

One festival of note is the annual North Halmahera Cultural Festival, when the Tobelorese wear full traditional ceremonial dress.&lt;ref name="EII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.east-indonesia.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=181|title=Tobelo: Around the Largest Town in Halmahera|publisher=East Indonesian Info|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Tobelorese weddings are also said to be among the most colourful and the Christians follow traditions during their wedding ceremonies, with traditional music and dance.&lt;ref name="EII"/&gt; A wedding is typically accompanied by traditional Tobelorese music, played with gongs and drums and a [[Cakalele]] dance is usually performed in front of the bride as she approaches the groom.&lt;ref name="EII"/&gt; Around the time of [[New Year]], Tobelo attracts a number of [[Yangere]] groups from all over North Halmahera and perform music and dances.&lt;ref name="EII"/&gt;

The main language of Tobelo, the [[Tobelo language]], is spoken across parts of [[North Halmahera Regency|North Halmahera]] and [[Central Halmahera Regency|Central Halmahera]], by approximately 28,000 people as at 2000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/language/tlb&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rituals===
Each year, in April, after the harvest season there is a practice of offering of plates of rice and certain items of basketry by the married women to the Church, duly observing conventional social norms. The offerings are then sold or auctioned during the Sunday services in the premises of the church. The returns from such sales go to the Church funds (''kas gereja''), which are used by the church for providing public services. It is more of ritual than an economic transaction.&lt;ref name=Coppet/&gt;

The other ritual observed in Tobelo is on the first Sunday of January when prayers are offered in the Church for the dead. On this occasion, each family decorates the graves of its deceased with flowers. This is also an occasion when women dressed in military uniform hold a parade through the village and enter houses demanding food and sweets.&lt;ref name=Coppet/&gt;

The rituals observed conform to both pre-Christian Tobelo customs and the post-Christian era culture conforming to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. However, marriages are conducted under the Tobelo customs, rituals and  practices. The family units are [[patriarchal|patrilineal]].&lt;ref name=Coppet/&gt;

==Economy==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tobleomarahai.jpg|thumb|right|The Tobelo sign]] --&gt;
Tobelo boasts large swathes of locally owned coconut plantations, supplying hundreds of tonnes of copra (dried coconut flesh) every month to the ports of [[Bitung]] (North Sulawesi) and [[Surabaya]] (East [[Java]]). The city, as the main centre for the North Halmahera has thus become the export hub for copra and other commodities.

[[Pulau Tulang]] is the nearest islet to the town, within swimming distance of the harbour. The Kupa-Kupa beach is located about {{convert|10|km|mi}} from the town, near the oil terminal for the [[Pertamina]] company. The beach is very clean and attracts tourists for snorkelling.&lt;ref name="EII"/&gt; Off the coast of Tobelo town is a group of small, coconut palm covered islands with golden sandy beaches. Longboats frequently travel from them to Tobelo town.&lt;ref name="EII"/&gt; Tobelo contains a hospital and a post office and is an important base and port on the island.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUlvd1a14VEC&amp;pg=PA909&amp;dq=tobelo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Bf0ZTPrNA5ehsQaikfHOBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=tobelo&amp;f=false|title=Footprint Indonesia Handbook|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|year=2001|isbn=1-900949-51-2|page=909|author=Eliot, J., Capaldi, L., Bickersteth, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post riots economic recovery===
In the three provinces of North Maluku, Maluku, and Central Sulawesi, following the sectarian conflict in 1999 which centred on Tobelo, devastated the well-being and economy of the people. This needed urgent attention of the authorities concerned in the government through a  development process. It was a  challenging task to both national and regional governments. The UN Common County Assessment (UNCCA) and [[United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)|Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)]] for 2002–2005 and UNDP’s Country Cooperation Framework decided to pitch in with assistance. They established a programme of linking relief and longer-term development as part of the UN’s support to Indonesia. The UNDP Crisis Prevention and Recovery Unit (CPRU), then launched three support programmes in North Maluku, Maluku and Central Sulawesi, which covered the Galea -Tobelo –South Tobelo Area. Three programmes were launched for the period 2002–2005 envisaging an investment of US $19 million with the objective of: {{quote|providing effective law enforcement, the rule of law and security; improve good governance in regional governments, local legislative bodies (DPRD), and the justice sector; improve policy formulation through increased participation of the public and ensure its implementation; resolve IDPs situations within a framework of building community resilience and social cohesion; and Develop the local economy and reduce unemployment through cross-community economic enterprises, skills training, start-up capital, and business opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.undp.or.id/programme/cpr/ptd.asp|title= UNDP Crisis Prevention and Recovery Programme|accessdate=2010-06-18|publisher= United Nations Development Programme, Indonesia}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

UNDP launched development project under the Galea – Tobelo – South Tobelo Area Recovery projects in 2002–2003, involved several projects for rural electrification, health facilities (capacity building), transportation, labour-intensive projects of roads and drainage, social activities of cross community collaboration projects of culture and sports empowerment, construction of bridges, markets, improvement of drainage systems and bus terminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.or.id/programme/cpr/documents/project_map_tobelo_february_2003.pdf|format=pdf|title= Galeal Tobelo –South Tobelo Area Recovery projects|year=2003|accessdate=2010-06-18|publisher=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economy is picking up and there are clear signs of recovery.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt; However, education facilities are still at the basic level. Tobelo and its neighbourhood are still considered a danger zone for foreigners.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt;

==Attractions==
Tobelo town has many attractions on the islands in its vicinity. One such island is the [[Tagalaya]] where sea is calm and the water is clear. The beaches are clean and have extensive spread of white sand. The major attraction here is the broad spread of [[coral reefs]], which are rich in [[marine life]] at a depth of {{convert|2|-|10|m|ft}}. The locale is also good for swimming and diving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.halmaherautara.com/en/wisata.php|title=Tourist attractions|accessdate=2010-06-17|publisher=Halmahera Utara Government of North Halmahera Regency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tabelo&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.east-indonesia.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=181|title=Tobelo: Around the Largest Town in Halmahera|accessdate=2010-06-17|publisher= Halmahera Utara: Government of North Halmahera Regency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attractions in Tabelo neighbourhood are the many beaches, lakes, off-shore islands, forested hills and a volcano. Some of the well-known places are:&lt;ref name=tabelo/&gt;

;Luari beach
Luari beach, the ethnic [[Galela]]rese village of [[Luari]] to the north of Tobelo, is on the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It has clear and calm waters and is safe for swimming and [[canoeing]]. [[Snorkelling]] is also done on the [[cape (geography)|cape]] to the north, from where sunset views, over [[Mount Tarakani]] and the coast of Galela, are impressive.&lt;ref name=tabelo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kupaka&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.halmaherautara.com/en/wisata.php?hal=2|title=Tourist attractions:Kupaka|accessdate=2010-06-17|publisher=Halmahera Utara Government of North Halmahera Regency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Kupa Kupa Beach
Kupakupa beach, {{convert|10|km|mi}} from the town, has huge [[banyan tree]]s on its shores, which makes the waters in the sheltered location inside the bay ideal for watersports, such as swimming, canoeing and snorkelling. The coral reef at its northern end is stated to be one of the finest. [[Pertamina harbour]] for oil-vessels is also located here.&lt;ref name=tabelo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kupaka/&gt;

;Kumo beach
Kumo beach on the Kumo island is the nearest to Tabelo town – a few minutes of motorised canoeing – is the busiest beach in North Halmahera. Its natural surroundings are scenic. Swimming is safe here.&lt;ref name=Kupaka/&gt;

;Tobotobo sea garden
Tobotobo Sea Garden in the Toboto village, which is ideal for snorkelling and diving. Thousands of [[bat]]s are seen here clinging to the mangrove trees. White and blue pigeons take bath here.&lt;ref name=Kein&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keindonesia.com/2009/01/north-maluku.html|title=North Maluku|accessdate=2010-06-19|publisher=Knowing Exploring Indonesia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Telaga Paca lake
Telaga Paca is a small crater lake close to Tobelo town to the south – a few km off the main road. The lake is set in a backdrop of thickly forested hills. There is also a small village by the same name Talaga Paca near the lake, which has a lookout area erected over stilts in the water to view the lake. A canoe could be hired to paddle in the lake. It is the source of drinking water to the village. Villagers do fishing in the lake.&lt;ref name=tabelo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hibualamo&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.halmaherautara.com/en/wisata.php?hal=6 |title=Tourist attractions: Hibualamo|accessdate=2010-06-17|publisher=Halmahera Utara Government of North Halmahera Regency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UGTA was linked with the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération nationale]]; however, in 1989, with constitutional changes and new laws the UGTA was distanced from the FLN and no longer retained the position of sole trade union center. Despite this, the UGTA continues to be, in practice, the only center - with few trade unions outside its affiliation.

During the [[Algerian Civil War]] the trade union movement was caught in the same violence that killed large numbers of civilians. Both [[International Centre for Trade Union Rights|ICTUR]]&lt;ref name="ICTUR"/&gt;  and [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Reasons range from deaths directly related to union activities, through to other political issues (such as fundamentalist views of women teachers), and endemic random violence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5141">'''WNYW''' ('''Radio New York Worldwide''') was a [[shortwave]] radio station that broadcast from [[Scituate, Massachusetts]], in the [[United States]]. During [[WWII]] the station became important for the British and the Norwegian information services. On October 20, 1973, Family Stations, Inc., acquired the station to be part of its [[Family Radio]] network and changed the [[call letters]] to [[WYFR]]. Family Stations eventually progressively moved the transmitters to their current site in [[Okeechobee, Florida]]. The [[transmitter]] site in Scituate continued to operate until November 16, 1979 when it was switched off for the last time.

==History==

On October 15, 1927, [[Walter Lemmon]], a radio inventor, was granted the first [[shortwave radio]] license in the United States and began experimental shortwave station '''W1XAL''' in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In 1935, the station began transmitting non-commercial, educational, and cultural programs. Supported by charitable institutions it was a not run for profit.

Four days after Britain and France declared war on Germany, on September 7, 1939, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) assigned call letters '''WRUL''' (for '''W'''orld '''R'''adio '''U'''niversity '''L'''isteners) to the station. As it had a large worldwide listening audience, which regularly corresponded with the station and a high power transmitter it was seen by [[British Security Co-ordination]] (BSC), a covert organization that the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secret Intelligence Service]] established in [[New York City]] as a vehicle for conducting political warfare on behalf of the British. The station was transmitting mostly in English so BSC provided through third parties the finance, translators, and foreign language announcers to produce high-quality programming in other languages. BSC also provided the material to be broadcast and so by 1941 WRUL had become unknowingly an arm of the BSC though outwardly independent and believing itself to be so.&lt;ref&gt;''The Secret History of British Intelligence in the Americas, 1940-1945'' p60-62&lt;/ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/military/story/0,,1852221,00.html] From 1939 to 1942, WRUL broadcast radio lectures to Europe and South America in eight languages, and also in the United States over an informal network of over 300 stations, including [[WNYC]] in New York City. Following the  establishment of what would become the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], American propaganda was provided to the station, but it was not until the entry of the US into the war that BSC handed over control. Like all United States shortwave stations, in November 1942 the U.S. government leased WRUL for further wartime propaganda broadcasts. WRUL was allowed to resume partial independent programming in 1947, and full independent programming in 1954.

From September 1940 and throughout WWII the Norwegian government had a daily half hour transmission in Norwegian for the sailors in the Norwegian commercial fleet. 

[[Metromedia]] bought the station in 1960. In June 1962, International Educational Broadcasting Corporation (now [[Bonneville International]]), owned by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], bought WRUL. The station adopted the slogan "Radio New York Worldwide"  and used studios in New York City and an [[adult contemporary]] format, with [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] or [[CBS Radio]] hourly and half-hour newscasts and from its sister station, [[WWPR-FM|WRFM]]. On-air staff from WRFM would also have separate shifts on WNYW. There were rumors that the station was being partially controlled by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to broadcast [[anti-communist]] [[propaganda]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On June 1, 1966, WRUL changed its call letters to '''WNYW''', which stood for Radio '''N'''ew '''Y'''ork '''W'''orldwide. The station attempted to do some commercial programming, but there were few advertisers because it was difficult to estimate audience ratings for the wide geographical area that shortwave stations typically covered.

In 1970, Bonneville offered to sell the station to the U.S. government for a token payment of one dollar, for use by the [[Voice of America]], but no sale materialized.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 1974, Bonneville sold WNYW. The [[callsign]] was assigned to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]'s [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] station, [[WNYW]] (formerly [[Metromedia]] station WNEW-TV and [[DuMont Television Network]] station WABD), in New York City.

The '''Washington Consensus''' is a set of 10 economic policy prescriptions considered to constitute the "standard" reform package promoted for [[Economic crisis|crisis-wracked]] [[developing country|developing countries]] by Washington, D.C.-based institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]] and [[United States Department of the Treasury]].&lt;ref name="piie.com"&gt;Williamson, John: [https://piie.com/commentary/speeches-papers/what-washington-means-policy-reform "What Washington Means by Policy Reform"], in: Williamson, John (ed.): ''Latin American Readjustment: How Much has Happened'', Washington: [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in 1989 by English economist [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington Consensus|url=http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/issues/washington.html|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prescriptions encompassed policies in such areas as macroeconomic stabilization, economic opening with respect to both trade and investment, and the expansion of market forces within the domestic economy.

Subsequent to Williamson's use of the terminology, and despite his emphatic opposition, the phrase Washington Consensus has come to be used fairly widely in a second, broader sense, to refer to a more general orientation towards a strongly market-based approach (sometimes described as [[market fundamentalism]] or [[neoliberalism]]).  In emphasizing the magnitude of the difference between the two alternative definitions, Williamson himself has argued (see {{section link||Origins of policy agenda}} and {{section link||Broad sense}} below) that his ten original, narrowly defined prescriptions have largely acquired the status of "motherhood and apple pie" (i.e., are broadly taken for granted), whereas the subsequent broader definition, representing a form of neoliberal manifesto, "never enjoyed a consensus [in Washington] or anywhere much else" and can reasonably be said to be dead.

Discussion of the Washington Consensus has long been contentious.  Partly this reflects a lack of agreement over what is meant by the term, in face of the contrast between the broader and narrower definitions.  But there are also substantive differences involved over the merits and consequences of the various policy prescriptions involved.  Some critics take issue, for example, with the original Consensus's emphasis on the opening of developing countries to global markets, and/or with what they see as an excessive focus on strengthening the influence of domestic market forces, arguably at the expense of key functions of the state.  For other commentators, the issue is more what is ''missing'', including such areas as institution-building and targeted efforts to improve opportunities for the weakest in society.  Despite these areas of controversy, a number of developmental institutions and economists (such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]]) would by now accept the more general proposition that strategies best work if they are specifically designed to the certain circumstances of the individual countries.

==History==

===Original sense: Williamson's Ten Points===
The concept and name of the Washington Consensus were first presented in 1989 by [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]], an economist from the [[Institute for International Economics]], an international economic [[think tank]] based in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iie.com/content/?ID=1#topic3 |title=A Guide To John Williamson's Writing |last1=Williamson |first1=John |website=www.piie.com |publisher=[[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] |accessdate=April 24, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705172400/http://www.iie.com/content/?ID=1#topic3 |archivedate=July 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson used the term to summarize commonly shared themes among policy advice by Washington-based institutions at the time, such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and U.S. Treasury Department, which were believed to be necessary for the recovery of countries in Latin America from the economic and financial crises of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The consensus as originally stated by Williamson included ten broad sets of relatively specific policy recommendations:&lt;ref name="piie.com"/&gt;
# [[Fiscal policy]] discipline, with avoidance of large fiscal deficits relative to GDP;
# Redirection of public spending from subsidies ("especially indiscriminate subsidies") toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, [[primary health care]] and infrastructure investment;
# [[Tax reform]], broadening the tax base and adopting moderate marginal tax rates;
# [[Interest rate]]s that are market determined and positive (but moderate) in real terms;
# Competitive [[exchange rate]]s;
# [[Trade liberalization]]: liberalization of imports, with particular emphasis on elimination of quantitative restrictions (licensing, etc.); any trade protection to be provided by low and relatively uniform [[tariff]]s;
# Liberalization of inward [[foreign direct investment]];
# [[Privatization]] of [[State-owned enterprise|state enterprise]]s;
# [[Deregulation]]: abolition of regulations that impede market entry or restrict competition, except for those justified on safety, environmental and consumer protection grounds, and prudential oversight of [[financial institution]]s;
# Legal security for [[property right]]s.

===Origins of policy agenda===
Although Williamson's label of the ''Washington'' Consensus draws attention to the role of the Washington-based agencies in promoting the above agenda, a number of authors have stressed that Latin American policy-makers arrived at their own packages of policy reforms primarily based on their own analysis of their countries' situations.  Thus, according to [[Joseph Stanislaw]] and [[Daniel Yergin]], authors of ''[[The Commanding Heights]]'', the policy prescriptions described in the Washington Consensus were "developed in Latin America, by Latin Americans, in response to what was happening both within and outside the region."&lt;ref name="Yergin and Stanislaw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yergin|first1=Daniel|last2=Stanislaw|first2=Joseph|authorlink1=Daniel Yergin|authorlink2=Joseph Stanislaw|title=The Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy|date=2002|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|location=New York City|isbn=9780743229630|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNYzPUhXhJYC&amp;pg=PT237|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Stiglitz has written that "the Washington Consensus policies were designed to respond to the very real problems in Latin America and made considerable sense" (though Stiglitz has at times been an outspoken critic of IMF policies as applied to developing nations).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, ''Globalization and its Discontents'' (2002), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the implication conveyed by the term Washington Consensus that the policies were largely external in origin, Stanislaw and Yergin report that the term's creator, John Williamson, has "regretted the term ever since", stating "it is difficult to think of a less diplomatic label."&lt;ref name="Yergin and Stanislaw"/&gt;

A 2010 paper by [[Nancy Birdsall]], [[Augusto de la Torre]], and [[Felipe Valencia Caicedo]] likewise suggests that the policies in the original consensus were largely a creation of Latin American politicians and technocrats, with Williamson's role having been to gather the ten points in one place for the first time, rather than to "create" the package of policies.&lt;ref name = "damaged"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In Williamson's own words from 2002:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;It is difficult even for the creator of the term to deny that the phrase "Washington Consensus" is a damaged brand name (Naím 2002). Audiences the world over seem to believe that this signifies a set of neoliberal policies that have been imposed on hapless countries by the Washington-based international financial institutions and have led them to crisis and misery. There are people who cannot utter the term without foaming at the mouth.

My own view is of course quite different. The basic ideas that I attempted to summarize in the Washington Consensus have continued to gain wider acceptance over the past decade, to the point where [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]] has had to endorse most of them in order to be electable. For the most part they are motherhood and apple pie, which is why they commanded a consensus.&lt;ref name=Williamson2002/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Broad sense===
Williamson recognizes that the term has commonly been used with a different meaning from his original prescription; he opposes the alternative use of the term, which became common after his initial formulation, to cover a broader market fundamentalism or "[[neoliberal]]" agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Moisés Naím, [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/1999/reforms/Naim.HTM ''Fads and Fashion in Economic Reforms: Washington Consensus or Washington Confusion?'']. October 26, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I of course never intended my term to imply policies like capital account liberalization (...I quite consciously excluded that), [[monetarism]], [[supply-side economics]], or a minimal state (getting the state out of welfare provision and income redistribution), which I think of as the quintessentially neoliberal ideas.  If that is how the term is interpreted, then we can all enjoy its wake, although let us at least have the decency to recognize that these ideas have rarely dominated thought in Washington and certainly never commanded a consensus there or anywhere much else...&lt;ref name=Williamson2002/&gt;}}

More specifically, Williamson argues that the first three of his ten prescriptions are uncontroversial in the economic community, while recognizing that the others have evoked some controversy. He argues that one of the least controversial prescriptions, the redirection of spending to infrastructure, health care, and education, has often been neglected. He also argues that, while the prescriptions were focused on reducing certain functions of government (e.g., as an owner of productive enterprises), they would also strengthen government's ability to undertake other actions such as supporting education and health. Williamson says that he does not endorse market fundamentalism, and believes that the Consensus prescriptions, if implemented correctly, would benefit the poor.&lt;ref name=Williamson2000 /&gt; In a book edited with Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski in 2003, Williamson laid out an expanded reform agenda, emphasizing crisis-proofing of economies, "second-generation" reforms, and policies addressing inequality and social issues (Kuczynski and Williamson, 2003).{{Full citation needed|date=May 2015}}

As noted, in spite of Williamson's reservations, the term Washington Consensus has been used more broadly to describe the general shift towards free market policies that followed the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] in the 1970s. In this broad sense the Washington Consensus is sometimes considered to have begun at about 1980.&lt;ref name = "GPE"&gt;{{Cite book

Many commentators see the consensus, especially if interpreted in the broader sense of the term, as having been at its strongest during the 1990s. Some have argued that the consensus in this sense ended at the turn of the century, or at least that it became less influential after about the year 2000.&lt;ref name = "damaged"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

More commonly, commentators have suggested that the Consensus in its broader sense survived until the time of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 global financial crisis]].&lt;ref name = "return"/&gt;
Following the [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence|strong intervention]] undertaken by governments in response to market failures, a number of journalists, politicians and senior officials from global institutions such as the World Bank began saying that the Washington Consensus was dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

These included former British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], who following the [[2009 G-20 London summit]], declared "the old Washington Consensus is over".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.sky.com/home/politics/article/15254629| title=''Prime Minister Gordon Brown: G20 Will Pump Trillion Dollars Into World Economy''| date=April 2, 2009| publisher=[[Sky News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson was asked by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in April 2009 whether he agreed with Gordon Brown that the Washington Consensus was dead.  He responded:

{{Quote|It depends on what one means by the Washington Consensus. If one means the ten points that I tried to outline, then clearly it's not right. If one uses the interpretation that a number of people—including Joe Stiglitz, most prominently—have foisted on it, that it is a neoliberal tract, then I think it is right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Conversation with John Williamson, Economist |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 12, 2009 |accessdate=August 5, 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/09/AR2009040903241.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit]] announced that it had achieved agreement on a [[Seoul Development Consensus]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'' editorialized that "Its pragmatic and pluralistic view of development is appealing enough.

==Context==
Many countries have endeavored to implement varying components of the reform packages, with implementation sometimes imposed as a condition for receiving loans from the IMF and World Bank.&lt;ref name = "GPE"/&gt; The results of these reforms are much debated. Some critics focus on claims that the reforms led to destabilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Development and Disorder: A History of the Third World since 1945 |last=Mason |first=Mike |year=1997 |publisher=University Press of New England |location=Hanover |isbn=0-87451-829-6 |page=428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have also blamed the Washington Consensus for particular economic crises such as the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|Argentine economic crisis]], and for exacerbating Latin America's economic inequalities.{{citation needed|reason=Who?|date=December 2014}} Criticism of the Washington Consensus has often been dismissed as socialism and/or [[anti-globalism]]. While these philosophies do criticize these policies, general criticism of the economics of the consensus is now more widely established, such as that outlined by US scholar [[Dani Rodrik]], Professor of International Political Economy at [[Harvard University]], in his paper ''Goodbye Washington Consensus, Hello Washington Confusion?''.&lt;ref name="PRIVATISEb"/&gt;

The institutions that formed the consensus started softening their insistence on these policies in the 2000s largely due to political pressures surrounding globalization, but any reference of these ideas as a consensus essentially ended in the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 global financial crisis]], as market fundamentalism lost favour. Though, it should be noted, that most of the core specific policies are still generally regarded favourably, but the policies have come to be viewed as not preventing nor alleviating acute economic crises. This is perhaps most notable in the work of the IMF with South Korea to create a new sort of intervention program to the one that South Korea was forced to accept during the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian Financial Crisis]] of the late 1990s. That intervention, which was heavily grounded in the Washington Consensus, was hailed at the time for stopping the "Asian Contagion" but eventually the program came to be seen more skeptically.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Williamson himself has summarized the overall results on growth, employment and [[poverty reduction]] in many countries as "disappointing, to say the least".  He attributes this limited impact to three factors: (a) the Consensus ''per se'' placed no special emphasis on mechanisms for avoiding economic crises, which have proved very damaging; (b) the reforms—both those listed in his article and, ''a fortiori'', those actually implemented—were incomplete; and (c) the reforms cited were insufficiently ambitious with respect to targeting improvements in income distribution, and need to be complemented by stronger efforts in this direction.  Rather than an argument for abandoning the original ten prescriptions, though, Williamson concludes that they are "motherhood and apple pie" and "not worth debating".&lt;ref name=Williamson2002&gt;Williamson J. (2002). [https://piie.com/commentary/speeches-papers/did-washington-consensus-fail ''Did the Washington Consensus Fail?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Both Williamson and other analysts have pointed to longer term improvements in economic performance in a number of countries that have adopted the relevant policy changes consistently, such as Chile (below).

As Williamson himself has pointed out, the term has come to be used in a broader sense to its original intention, as a synonym for market fundamentalism or neo-liberalism. In this broader sense, Williamson states, it has been criticized by people such as [[George Soros]] and [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] [[List of Nobel laureates|Laureate]] [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]].&lt;ref name=Williamson2000&gt;Williamson J. (2000). [https://piie.com/commentary/speeches-papers/what-should-world-bank-think-about-washington-consensus ''What Should the Bank Think about the Washington Consensus?''].&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington Consensus is also criticized by others such as some Latin American politicians and [[heterodox economics|heterodox economists]] such as [[Erik Reinert]].&lt;ref name=Reinert2000&gt;Reinert, Erik S. (2000) The Underdevelopment of Mongolia in the 1990s—Why Globalisation is one Nation's Food and the Other Nation's Poison&lt;/ref&gt; The term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the [[free market]], constraints upon the [[Sovereign state|state]], and the influence of the United States, and globalization more broadly, on countries' national [[sovereignty]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

While opinion varies among economists, Rodrik pointed out what he claimed was a factual paradox: while China and India increased their economies' reliance on free market forces to a limited extent, their general economic policies remained the exact opposite to the Washington Consensus' main recommendations. Both had high levels of [[protectionism]], no [[privatization]], extensive industrial policies planning, and lax fiscal and financial policies through the 1990s. Had they been dismal failures they would have presented strong evidence in support of the recommended Washington Consensus policies. However they turned out to be successes.&lt;ref name=PRIVATISEz&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/swhiting/pols502/Rodrik_Washington_Confusion.pdfDani Rodrik1. ''Goodbye Washington Consensus, Hello Washington Confusion?'' Harvard University, January 2006, pp. 3–5]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rodrik: "While the lessons drawn by proponents and skeptics differ, it is fair to say that nobody really believes in the Washington Consensus anymore. The question now is not whether the Washington Consensus is dead or alive; it is what will replace it".&lt;ref name="PRIVATISEb"/&gt;

Rodrik's account of Chinese or Indian policies during the period is not universally accepted. Among other things those policies involved major turns in the direction of greater reliance upon market forces, both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the origins of the Chinese reforms and their implementation over roughly the first decade of the reforms is provided by Harry Harding in ''China's Second Revolution: Reform after Mao''.  Brookings, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book edited with [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] in 2003, John Williamson laid out an expanded reform agenda, emphasizing crisis-proofing of economies, "second-generation" reforms, and policies addressing inequality and social issues.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Macroeconomic adjustment==
The widespread adoption by governments of the Washington Consensus was to a large degree a reaction to the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] crisis that hit much of Latin America, and some other developing regions, during the 1980s.  The crisis had multiple origins: the drastic rise in the price of imported oil following the emergence of [[OPEC]], mounting levels of external debt, the rise in US (and hence international) interest rates, and—consequent to the foregoing problems—loss of access to additional foreign credit.  The import-substitution policies that had been pursued by many developing country governments in Latin America and elsewhere for several decades had left their economies ill-equipped to expand exports at all quickly to pay for the additional cost of imported oil (by contrast, many countries in East Asia, which had followed more [[export-oriented industrialization|export-oriented strategies]], found it comparatively easy to expand exports still further, and as such managed to accommodate the external shocks with much less economic and social disruption).  Unable either to expand external borrowing further or to ramp up export earnings easily, many Latin American countries faced no obvious sustainable alternatives to reducing overall domestic demand via greater fiscal discipline, while in parallel adopting policies to reduce protectionism and increase their economies' export orientation.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Patrice Franko, "The Puzzle of Latin American Development" (3rd edition, 2007), or Michael Read, "Forgotten Continent" (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade liberalization==
The Washington Consensus, as framed by Williamson, envisaged a largely ''unilateral'' process of trade reform, by which countries would lower their non-tariff (especially) and tariff barriers to imports.  Many countries, including the majority of those in Latin America, have indeed undertaken significant unilateral trade liberalization over subsequent years, opening their economies to greater import competition while simultaneously increasing the share of exports in their GDP (in parallel, Latin America's share in global trade has also increased).{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

A separate agenda—only tangentially related to the Washington Consensus as framed by Williamson—concerns various programs for ''multilateral'' trade liberalization, whether at the global (WTO) or regional level, including the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and [[DR-CAFTA]] agreements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Criticism==
Most criticism has been focused on trade liberalization and the elimination of subsidies, and criticism has been particularly strident in the agriculture sector. In nations with substantial natural resources, though, criticism has tended to focus on privatization of industries exploiting these resources.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

As of the 2000s, several Latin American countries were led by socialist or other left wing governments, some of which—including Argentina and Venezuela—have campaigned for (and to some degree adopted) policies contrary to the Washington Consensus policies. Other Latin American countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Chile and Peru, in practice adopted the bulk of the policies included in Williamson's list, even though they criticized the market fundamentalism that these are often associated with. Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the IMF have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the 'fundamentalist' policies of the IMF and the [[US Treasury]] for what Stiglitz calls a 'one size fits all' treatment of individual economies. According to Stiglitz the treatment suggested by the IMF is too simple: one dose, and fast—stabilize, liberalize and privatize, without prioritizing or watching for side effects.&lt;ref name=CALLENGING&gt;[http://www.watsoninstitute.org/bjwa/archive/9.2/Feature/stiglitz.pdf Stiglitz, Joseph.

{{quote |The reforms did not always work out the way they were intended. While growth generally improved across much of Latin America, it was in most countries less than the reformers had originally hoped for (and the "transition crisis", as noted above deeper and more sustained than hoped for in some of the former socialist economies). Success stories in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1990s were relatively few and far in between, and market-oriented reforms by themselves offered no formula to deal with the growing public health emergency in which the continent became embroiled. The critics, meanwhile, argue that the disappointing outcomes have vindicated their concerns about the inappropriateness of the standard reform agenda.&lt;ref name=BELOW&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/swhiting/pols502/Rodrik_Washington_Confusion.pdf Dani Rodrik.

Besides the excessive belief in market fundamentalism and international economic institutions in attributing the failure of the Washington consensus, Stiglitz provided a further explanation about why it failed. In his article "The Post Washington Consensus Consensus",&lt;ref name="policydialogue.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://policydialogue.org/files/events/Stiglitz_Post_Washington_Consensus_Paper.pdf |title=The Post Washington Consensus Consensus |author=[[Joseph Stiglitz]] |date= |website=policydialogue.org |publisher=The Initiative for Policy Dialogue |access-date=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he claims that the Washington consensus policies failed to efficiently handle the economic structures within developing countries. The cases of East Asian countries such as Korea and Taiwan are known as a success story in which their remarkable economic growth was attributed to a larger role of the government by undertaking [[industrial policies]] and increasing domestic savings within their territory. From the cases, the role for government was proven to be critical at the beginning stage of the dynamic process of development, at least until the markets by themselves can produce efficient outcomes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

{{quote |The policies pursued by the international financial institutions which came to be called the Washington consensus policies or neoliberalism entailed a much more circumscribed role for the state than were embraced by most of the East Asian countries, a set of policies which (in another simplification) came to be called the [[development state]].&lt;ref name="policydialogue.org"/&gt;}}

The critique laid out in the World Bank's study ''Economic Growth in the 1990s: Learning from a Decade of Reform'' (2005)&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. ''Economic Growth in the 1990s: Learning from a Decade of Reform'' Washington, D.C., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; shows how far discussion has come from the original ideas of the Washington Consensus. Gobind Nankani, a former vice-president for Africa at the World Bank, wrote in the preface: "there is no unique universal set of rules.... [W]e need to get away from formulae and the search for elusive 'best practices'...." (p. xiii). The World Bank's new emphasis is on the need for humility, for policy diversity, for selective and modest reforms, and for experimentation.&lt;ref name=CRITIQUEWB&gt;World Bank, Economic Growth in the 1990s: Learning from a Decade of Reform, Washington, D.C., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank's report ''Learning from Reform'' shows some of the developments of the 1990s. There was a deep and prolonged collapse in output in some (though by no means all) countries making the transition from [[communism]] to market economies (many of the Central and East European countries, by contrast, made the adjustment relatively rapidly). Academic studies show that more than two decades into the transition, some of the former communist countries, especially parts of the former Soviet Union, had still not caught up to their levels of output before 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghodsee|first=Kristen|date=2017 |title=Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-hangover|location= |publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|pages=63 |isbn=978-0822369493|author-link=Kristen R.

There were several successive and painful financial crises in Latin America, East Asia, Russia, and Turkey. The Latin American recovery in the first half of the 1990s was interrupted by crises later in the decade. There was less growth in per capita GDP in Latin America than in the period of rapid post-War expansion and opening in the world economy, 1950–80.

Among other results of the recent global financial crisis has been a strengthening of belief in the importance of local development models as more suitable than programmatic approaches. Some elements of this school of thought were summarized in the idea of a "[[Beijing Consensus]]" which suggested that nations needed to find their own paths to development and reform.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Anti-globalization movement===
Many critics of [[trade liberalization]], such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]], and [[Naomi Klein]], see the Washington Consensus as a way to open the [[labor market]] of underdeveloped economies to exploitation by companies from more developed economies. The prescribed reductions in tariffs and other [[trade barrier]]s allow the free movement of goods across borders according to [[market forces]], but labor is not permitted to move freely due to the requirements of a [[Visa (document)|visa]] or a work permit. This creates an economic climate where goods are manufactured using cheap labor in underdeveloped economies and then exported to rich First World economies for sale at what the critics argue are huge markups, with the balance of the markup said to accrue to large multinational corporations. The criticism is that workers in the [[Third World]] economy nevertheless remain poor, as any pay raises they may have received over what they made before trade liberalization are said to be offset by inflation, whereas workers in the First World country become unemployed, while the wealthy owners of the multinational grow even more wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39505718|title=Profit over people : neoliberalism and global order|last=Noam.|first=Chomsky,|date=1999|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=9781888363821|oclc=39505718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-globalization movement|Anti-globalism]] critics further claim that First World countries impose what the critics describe as the consensus's neoliberal policies on economically vulnerable countries through organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and by political pressure and bribery. They argue that the Washington Consensus has not, in fact, led to any great economic boom in Latin America, but rather to severe economic crises and the accumulation of crippling [[external debt]]s that render the target country beholden to the First World.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Many of the policy prescriptions (e.g., the privatization of state industries, tax reform, and deregulation) are criticized as mechanisms for ensuring the development of a small, wealthy, indigenous elite in the Third World who will rise to political power and also have a vested interest in maintaining the local status quo of labor exploitation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Some specific factual premises of the critique as phrased above (especially on the macroeconomic side) are not accepted by defenders, or indeed all critics, of the Washington Consensus. To take a few examples,&lt;ref&gt;"Statistical Yearbook for Latin America and the Caribbean" (annual). UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;/ref&gt; inflation in many developing countries is now at its lowest levels for many decades (low single figures for very much of Latin America). Workers in some factories created by foreign investment are found typically to receive higher wages and better working conditions than exist in many of their own countries' domestically owned workplaces. Economic growth in much of Latin America in the last few years has been at historically high rates, and debt levels, relative to the size of these economies, are on average significantly lower than they were several years ago.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Despite these macroeconomic advances, poverty and inequality remain at high levels in Latin America.  About one of every three people—165&amp;nbsp;million in total—still live on less than $2 a day. Roughly a third of the population has no access to electricity or basic sanitation, and an estimated 10 million children suffer from malnutrition.  These problems are not, however, new: Latin America was the most economically unequal region in the world in 1950, and has continued to be so ever since, during periods both of state-directed import-substitution and (subsequently) of market-oriented liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Read, "Forgotten Continent" (2007), page 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some socialist political leaders in Latin America have been vocal and well-known critics of the Washington Consensus, such as the late Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]], Cuban ex-President [[Fidel Castro]], Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]], and [[Rafael Correa]], President of [[Ecuador]]. In Argentina, too, the recent [[Justicialist Party]] government of [[Néstor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] undertook policy measures which represented a repudiation of at least some Consensus policies (see Continuing Controversy below). With the exception of Castro, these leaders have maintained and expanded some successful policies commonly associated with the Washington Consensus, such as macroeconomic stability and property rights protection. But many have also proposed and implemented policies directly opposed to the Washington Consensus: under Chavez, for example, Venezuela partially nationalized the state-run oil company, [[PDVSA|Petróleos de Venezuela S.A]] (PdVSA), and with the help of the company's assets developed several social programs to help the country's poor. These programs have been credited with the dramatic improvement in quality of life during Chavez's presidency: the poverty rate dropped from 48.6% in 2002 to 29.5% in 2011, while access to education and healthcare was significantly increased.&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Devereux and Raymond Colitt, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-07/venezuelans-quality-of-life-improved-in-un-index-under-chavez.html Venezuelans’ Quality of Life Improved in UN Index Under Chavez.] Bloomberg News May 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others on the Latin American left take a different approach.  Governments led by the Socialist Party of [[Chile]], by [[Alan García]] in Peru, by [[Tabaré Vázquez]] in Uruguay, and by [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] in Brazil, have in practise maintained a high degree of continuity with the economic policies described under the Washington Consensus (debt-paying, protection to foreign investment, financial reforms, etc.). But governments of this type have simultaneously sought to supplement these policies by measures directly targeted at improving productivity and helping the poor, such as education reforms and subsidies to poor families conditioned on their children staying in school.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Neo-Keynesian criticisms===
[[Neo-Keynesian economics|Neo-Keynesian]] and [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]] critics of the Consensus{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} have argued that the underlying policies were incorrectly laid down and are too rigid to be able to succeed. For example, flexible [[labor law]]s were supposed to [[job creation|create new jobs]], but economic evidence from Latin America is inconclusive on this point. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} In addition, some argue that the package of policies does not take into account economic and cultural differences between countries.{{by whom|date=July 2015}} Some critics have argued that this set of policies should be implemented, if at all, during a period of rapid economic growth and not—as often is the case—during an [[economic crisis]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Moisés Naím]], chief editor of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', has made the argument that there was no 'consensus' in the first place.  He has argued that there are and have been major differences between economists over what is the 'correct economic policy', hence the idea of there being a consensus was also flawed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Proponents of the "European model" and the "Asian way"===
Some European and Asian economists suggest that "infrastructure-savvy economies" such as [[Norway]], Singapore, and China have partially rejected the underlying Neoclassical "financial orthodoxy" that characterizes the Washington Consensus, instead initiating a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] development path of their own&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{Citation |url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/op-ed/2799/forecasting-the-future-the-brics-and-the-china-model.html |accessdate=2011-03-09 |title=see M.

While China invested roughly 9% of its GDP on infrastructure in the 1990s and 2000s, most Western and non-Asian emerging economies invested only 2% to 4% of their GDP in infrastructure assets. This considerable investment gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near-optimal conditions while many South American, South Asian, and African economies suffered from various development bottlenecks like poor transportation networks, aging power grids, and mediocre schools.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Argentina==
{{See also|1998–2002 Argentine great depression|Argentine debt restructuring}}
The [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|Argentine economic crisis of 1999–2002]] is often held out as an example of the economic devastation said by some to have been wrought by application of the Washington Consensus. Argentina's former Deputy Foreign Minister [[Jorge Taiana]], in an interview with the state news agency [[Télam]] on August 16, 2005, attacked the Washington Consensus. There never was a real consensus for such policies, he said, and today "a good number of governments of the hemisphere are reviewing the assumptions with which they applied those policies in the 1990s", adding that governments are looking for a development model to guarantee productive employment and the generation of real wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telam.com.ar/especial_xx04.asp |title=Télam – Agencia Nacional de Noticias de la República Argentina |publisher=Telam.com.ar |date=January 1, 1980 |accessdate=2012-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716185724/http://www.telam.com.ar/especial_xx04.asp |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many economists, however, challenge the view that Argentina's failure can be attributed to close adherence to the Washington Consensus.  The country's adoption of an idiosyncratic fixed exchange rate regime (the [[convertibility plan]]), which became increasingly uncompetitive, together with its failure to achieve effective control over its fiscal accounts, both ran counter to central provisions of the Consensus, and paved the way directly for the ultimate macroeconomic collapse.  The market-oriented policies of the early Menem-Cavallo years, meanwhile, soon petered out in the face of domestic political constraints (including Menem's preoccupation with securing re-election).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Perry and Serven, "The Anatomy of a Multiple Crisis" (2003); Mussa, "Argentina and the Fund" (2002); Blustein, "And the Money Kept Flowing In.... and Out" (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1998, the IMF invited Argentine President [[Carlos Menem]], to talk about the successful Argentine experience, at the Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors.&lt;ref name=menem&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Menem's Minister of Economy (1991–1996), [[Domingo Cavallo]], the architect of the Menem administration's economic policies, specifically including "convertibility", made the claim that Argentina was at that moment, "considered as the best pupil of the IMF, the World Bank and the USA government":

{{quote|On the second semester of 1998 Argentina was considered in Washington the most successful economy among the ones that had restructured its debt within the Brady's Plan framework.

The problems which arise with reliance on a fixed exchange rate mechanism (above) are discussed in the World Bank report ''Economic Growth in the 1990s: Learning from a Decade of Reform'', which questions whether expectations can be "positively affected by tying a government's hands". In the early 1990s there was a point of view that countries should move to either fixed or completely flexible exchange rates to reassure market participants of the complete removal of government discretion in foreign exchange matters. After the Argentina collapse, some observers believe that removing government discretion by creating mechanisms that impose large penalties may, on the contrary, actually itself undermine expectations. Velasco and Neut (2003)&lt;ref name=VELASCONEUT&gt;Velasco,Andres, and Alejandro Neut. 2003."Tough Policies, Incredible Policies?" NBER Working Paper No. 9932. National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge,

The IMF's [[Independent Evaluation Office]] has issued a review of the lessons of Argentina for the institution, summarized in the following quotation:
{{quote|The Argentine crisis yields a number of lessons for the IMF, some of which have already been learned and incorporated into revised policies and procedures.

[[Mark Weisbrot]] says that, in more recent years, Argentina under former President [[Néstor Kirchner]] made a break with the Consensus and that this led to a significant improvement in its economy; some add that Ecuador may soon follow suit.&lt;ref&gt;Weisbrot, Mark, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/12/28/opinion/edweis.php "Doing it their own way,"] ''International Herald Tribune'', December 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Kirchner's reliance on price controls and similar administrative measures (often aimed primarily at ''foreign-invested'' firms such as utilities) clearly ran counter to the spirit of the Consensus, his administration in fact ran an extremely tight fiscal ship and maintained a highly competitive floating exchange rate; Argentina's immediate bounce-back from crisis, further aided by abrogating its debts and a fortuitous boom in prices of primary commodities, leaves open issues of longer-term sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petersoninstitute.org/publications/papers/mussa0406.pdf Global Economic Prospects 2006/2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin America—The return of populism.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, Kirchner's wife and successor as President, [[Cristina Kirchner]], announced her government's intention to nationalize pension funds from the privatized system implemented by Menem-Cavallo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122516435782975265 Argentina's Pension Plan Presses On, Driving Down Markets and the Peso]&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations have emerged of the manipulation of official statistics under the Kirchners (most notoriously, for inflation) to create an inaccurately positive picture of economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/15/AR2009081502758.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Doctored Data Cast Doubt on Argentina | first=Juan | last=Forero | date=August 16, 2009 | accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Economist'' removed Argentina's inflation measure from its official indicators, saying that they were no longer reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Official statistics: Don’t lie to me, Argentina|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21548242|accessdate=January 21, 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Argentina's and Brazil's presidents, Néstor Kirchner and [[Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]] signed the "Buenos Aires Consensus", a manifesto opposing the Washington Consensus' policies.&lt;ref&gt;Massaldi, Julian, [http://www.zcommunications.org/buenos-aires-consensus-by-julian-massaldi "Buenos Aires Consensus: Lula and Kirchner's agreement 'Against Neoliberalism'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927070907/http://www.zcommunications.org/buenos-aires-consensus-by-julian-massaldi |date=September 27, 2012 }}, Znet, November 20, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptical political observers note, however, that Lula's rhetoric on such public occasions should be distinguished from the policies actually implemented by his administration.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Financial Times at following link: [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d62ca1a2-c219-11db-ae23-000b5df10621.html Left turn ahead?

==Subsidies for agriculture==
The Washington Consensus as formulated by Williamson includes provision for the redirection of [[public spending]] from subsidies ("especially indiscriminate subsidies") toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, [[primary health care]] and infrastructure investment.  This definition leaves some room for debate over specific public spending programs.  One area of public controversy has focused on the issues of subsidies to farmers for fertilizers and other modern farm inputs: on the one hand, these can be criticized as subsidies, on the other, it may be argued that they generate positive externalities that might justify the subsidy involved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Some critics of the Washington Consensus cite Malawi's experience with [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]], for example, as exemplifying perceived flaws in the package's prescriptions.  For decades, the World Bank and donor nations pressed [[Malawi]], a predominantly rural country in Africa, to cut back or eliminate government fertilizer subsidies to farmers. World Bank experts also urged the country to have Malawi farmers shift to growing cash crops for export and to use foreign exchange earnings to import food.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;New York Times, 2007 December 2, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?em&amp;ex=1196744400&amp;en=8dc6209db5ec0efe&amp;ei=5087%0A Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts]"&lt;/ref&gt; For years, Malawi hovered on the brink of famine; after a particularly disastrous corn harvest in 2005, almost five million of its 13 million people needed emergency food aid. Malawi's newly elected president [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] then decided to reverse policy. Introduction of deep fertilizer subsidies (and lesser ones for seed), abetted by good rains, helped farmers produce record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007; according to government reports, corn production leapt from 1.2&amp;nbsp;million metric tons in 2005 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;million in 2006 and 3.4&amp;nbsp;million in 2007.  The prevalence of acute child hunger has fallen sharply and Malawi recently turned away emergency food aid.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In a commentary on the Malawi experience prepared for the [[Center for Global Development]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgdev.org/blog/value-rejecting-expert-advice |title=Global Development: Views from the Center: The Value of Rejecting Expert Advice |author=Vijaya Ramachandran |date=July 7, 2012 |website=cgdev.org |publisher=Center for Global Development |access-date=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; development economists Vijaya Ramachandran and Peter Timmer argue that fertilizer subsidies in parts of Africa (and Indonesia) can have benefits that substantially exceed their costs.  They caution, however, that how the subsidy is operated is crucial to its long-term success, and warn against allowing fertilizer distribution to become a monopoly.  Ramachandran and Timmer also stress that African farmers need more than just input subsidies—they need better research to develop new inputs and new seeds, as well as better transport and energy infrastructure. The World Bank reportedly now sometimes supports the temporary use of fertilizer subsidies aimed at the poor and carried out in a way that fosters private markets: "In Malawi, Bank officials say they generally support Malawi's policy, though they criticize the government for not having a strategy to eventually end the subsidies, question whether its 2007 corn production estimates are inflated and say there is still a lot of room for improvement in how the subsidy is carried out".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Continuing controversy==

Most Latin American countries continue to struggle with high poverty and [[underemployment]]. Chile has been offered as an example of a Consensus success story, and countries such as [[El Salvador]] and Panama have also shown some positive signs of economic development. Brazil, despite relatively modest rates of aggregate growth, has seen important progress in recent years in the reduction of poverty. This is counterweight, since the last two Brazilian [[Dilma Rousseff|socialist presidents]] have adjusted modest socialist reforms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Joseph Stiglitz has argued that the Chilean success story owes a lot to state ownership of key industries, particularly [[Codelco|its]] copper industry, and [[currency intervention]]s stabilizing capital flows. Many other economists, though, argue that Chile's economic success is largely due to its combination of sound macroeconomics and market-oriented policies (though the country's relatively strong public institutions, including one of the better public school systems in the region, also deserve some credit).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Martinez and Diaz, "Chile: the Great Transformation" (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been claims of discrepancies between the Washington Consensus as propounded by Williamson, and the policies actually implemented with the endorsement of the Washington institutions themselves. For example, the Washington Consensus stated a need for investment in education, but the policies of fiscal discipline promoted by the International Monetary Fund have sometimes in practice led countries to cut back public spending on social programs, including such areas as basic education.  Those familiar with the work of the IMF respond that, at a certain stage, countries near bankruptcy have to cut back their public spending one way or another to live within their means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Politics/Fischer_Asia.html Stanley Fischer on the IMF and East Asia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Washington may argue for enlightened choices among different public spending priorities, but in the last analysis it is domestically elected political leaders who ultimately have to make the tough political choices.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Missing elements==
A significant body of economists and policy-makers argues that what was wrong with the Washington Consensus as originally formulated by Williamson had less to do with what was ''included'' than with what was ''missing''.&lt;ref&gt;See, as examples representative of a much more extensive literature, e.g., Birdsall and de la Torre. ''Washington Contentious'' (2003); Kuczynski and Williamson (eds.), ''After the Washington Consensus'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This view asserts that countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, largely governed by parties of the left in recent years, did not—whatever their rhetoric—in practice abandon most of the substantive elements of the Consensus.  Countries that have achieved macroeconomic stability through fiscal and monetary discipline have been loath to abandon it: Lula, the former President of Brazil (and former leader of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party of Brazil]]), has stated explicitly that the defeat of [[hyperinflation]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/gfranco/How%20Brazil%20Beat%20Hyperinflation.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was among the most important positive contributions of the years of his presidency to the welfare of the country's poor, although the remaining influence of his policies on tackling poverty and maintaining a steady low rate of inflation are being discussed and doubted in the wake of the Brazilian Economic Crisis currently occurring in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-06/imf-says-brazil-economy-to-shrink-3-in-2015-on-political-crisis&lt;/ref&gt;

These economists and policy-makers would, however, overwhelmingly agree that the Washington Consensus was ''incomplete'', and that countries in Latin America and elsewhere need to move beyond "first generation" macroeconomic and trade reforms to a stronger focus on [[productivity]]-boosting reforms and direct programs to support the poor.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Birdsall and de la Torre, ''Washington Contentious'' (2003); de Ferranti and Ody, [http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/20060803.pdf ''Key Economic and Social Challenges for Latin America''] (2006):&lt;/ref&gt; This includes improving the investment climate and eliminating [[red tape]] (especially for smaller firms), strengthening institutions (in areas like justice systems), fighting poverty directly via the types of [[Conditional Cash Transfer]] programs adopted by countries like Mexico and Brazil, improving the quality of primary and secondary education, boosting countries' effectiveness at developing and absorbing technology, and addressing the special needs of historically disadvantaged groups including [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and [[Afro-Latin American|Afro-descendant]] populations across Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Alternative usage vis-à-vis foreign policy==
In early 2008, the term "Washington Consensus" was used in a different sense as a metric for analyzing American [[mainstream media]] coverage of U.S. [[foreign policy]] generally and Middle East policy specifically.  Marda Dunsky writes, "Time and again, with exceedingly rare exceptions, the media repeat without question, and fail to challenge the "Washington consensus"—the official mind-set of US governments on Middle East peacemaking over time."&lt;ref&gt;Marda Dunsky, ''Pens and Swords: How the Mainstream Media Report the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict'', 2008, [[Columbia University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-231-13349-4}}, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; According to syndicated columnist [[William Pfaff]], Beltway centrism in American mainstream media coverage of foreign affairs is the rule rather than the exception: "Coverage of international affairs in the US is almost entirely Washington-driven.  That is, the questions asked about foreign affairs are Washington's questions, framed in terms of domestic politics and established policy positions.  This invites uninformative answers and discourages unwanted or unpleasant views."&lt;ref&gt;Vicki O'Hara, Reaction to the Greater Middle East Initiative, which encourages democracy in Arab countries, [[NPR]]/[[Morning Edition]], March 23, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Like the economic discussion above the foreign policy usage of the term has less to do with what is included than with what is missing.

A similar view, though by a different name, is taken by [[Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR), a progressive media criticism organization.  They note "Official Agendas" as one of nine 'issue areas'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=101 What's Wrong With the News?] fair.org&lt;/ref&gt; they view as causing 'What's Wrong With the News?" They note: "Despite the claims that the press has an adversarial relationship with the government, in truth U.S. media generally follow Washington's official line. This is particularly obvious in wartime and in foreign policy coverage, but even with domestic controversies, the spectrum of debate usually falls in the relatively narrow range between the leadership of the Democratic and Republican parties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=7&amp;issue_area_id=36 Issue Area: Official Agendas] fair.org&lt;/ref&gt;
